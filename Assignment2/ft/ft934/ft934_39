FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (1): Slow recovery
has compensations - Keynote / But the stock market, like the economy, is a
more dangerous place than it seems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY

<TEXT>
HOW MUCH are we willing to pay for security in our investments? As the
markets rose and became still riskier in the third quarter of the year, the
question became more urgent for personal investors.
A different kind of safety has also become a pressing issue for occupational
pension schemes, culminating in the publication of the Goode Report on
pension law reform last month.
For individual savers the big challenge continues to be the shift of
emphasis from nice, safe income to more ephemeral capital gains. True,
short-term interest rates have not fallen since last January in the UK, but
the possibility of a cut keeps re-emerging: Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of
the exchequer, let go his chance of a rate to coincide with the Conservative
Party conference earlier this month, but he will have another opportunity
around Budget Day, November 30.
Meanwhile, long-term interest rates are slipping consistently. The yield on
long-dated government securities slid from 8.1 per cent to 7.3 per cent
during the quarter. The yield on equities also fell, but not so rapidly.
When yields decline in the securities markets, investors are compensated by
the capital gains that are the reverse side of the coin. But the higher that
the markets rise, the greater the natural fear that one day the process will
go into reverse.
The July-September period, however, was a time for greed rather than fear.
Although European politicians generally had a bad and embarrassing summer as
the European Monetary System crumbled around them, investors could relax on
the beach contentedly. Perhaps the sunshine was erratic, but generally the
financial markets were set fair.
London share prices entered new high ground in August, hitting a peak on the
27th. It seemed that the deputy fund managers were a little
over-enthusiastic, though. When their bosses returned at the beginning of
September the market cooled off. Still, the FT-SE 100 Index showed a gain of
4.7 per cent for the three months, its best quarterly showing of 1993 so
far.
Once again, however, the big blue-chips dragged their feet, with
disappointing results coming from the likes of Tesco, Guinness and P&amp;O.
Fearsome levels of competition hit many of the consumer sectors, dashing
hopes that companies would be able to put up prices and restore their profit
margins as the recession came to an end and economic recovery began.
Forecasters have been polishing up their numbers for the UK economy in 1993.
It now looks as though GDP growth may hit nearer 2 per cent than the 1-1 1/2
per cent expected earlier. Yet this is still far from the vigorous
bounce-back from recession that was once typical of the UK's economic cycle.
No sooner had the motor industry celebrated a year-on-year rise of 18 per
cent in 'K' car registrations in August than a series of announcements of
autumn production cutbacks came out, because Continental demand had slumped.
In the US, too, where the recovery has being going on longer, its strength
is still rather disappointing and erratic.
A slow but steady recovery has its compensations. It makes for low
volatility and a stable trend in the securities markets. To make their
fortunes in 1993, investors have had to chase risky recoveries in the
advanced countries (in Italy, say) and hair-raising booms in the developing
world. Nearer home the rewards have been more meagre, but it has been easy
to sleep at night.
The world now looks quite a deflationary place, at least as far as the
advanced economies are concerned. They are flooded with cheap imported goods
from the Far East, holding prices down, and high levels of unemployment are
keeping pay inflation under tight control.
On the one hand, this is excellent news for the bond markets, subject only
to the fear that too many governments maybe unable to restrain their budget
deficits in the recession. Low levels of interest rates and inflation are
also positive for equities. However, if companies are unable to generate at
least a modicum of profits growth and dividend expansion, equities may at
some point look dangerously ahead of the game.
Up to the end of the third quarter, most of the recent trends remained
intact. In particular, small companies continued to outperform, with the
FT-Actuaries SmallCap Index running 2 1/2 percentage points ahead of the
Footsie during the three months (and 23 per cent ahead after nine months of
the year).
The small-company theme is becoming ever more mature, however, and the
average p/e ratio of the constituents of the SmallCap has risen to an
awesome 35. That looks more like Tokyo than London. Such ratings are, not
surprisingly, attracting dozens of new listings as entrepreneurs and
management buy-out teams seek to cash in.
Can an investment in Tiddler plc or Titchy plc pay off at these prices? The
argument runs: first, there is a recovery and those companies that have
survived the recession are lean and fit; and second, small companies usually
operate nimbly in niche markets, whereas too many big companies are
painfully exposed to overcapacity.
Food retailing, for instance, has been the latest to be devastated by the
fear of over-expansion: the sector index underperformed by 17 per cent in
the third quarter, and the sector now offers a market average dividend
yield. Much the same, for slightly different reasons, has happened to the
pharmaceuticals sector.
The stock market, like the economy at large, is therefore a rather more
dangerous place than it appears to be on the surface, where the indices have
shown a fairly steady trend. There is churning and upheaval  - the experts
call it sector rotation  - and you should not take it too much for granted
that whatever stocks did well in the third quarter will still be the stars
of your portfolio by Christmas.
As for the pension schemes, they face the consequences of the discovery that
Robert Maxwell had apparently stolen over Pounds 400m from the pension
schemes in his various companies in the months before he was found dead in
the sea just about two years ago.
The Goode Committee has recommended the setting-up of a new pensions
regulator, and the introduction of a minimum solvency standard to ensure
that schemes can meet their obligations if their sponsoring company suddenly
goes bust. A compensation scheme will bail out victims if there is fraud or
misconduct.
The catch is that a watertight system is expensive to run, and it is much
cheaper to leave some loopholes. When companies failed to protest vigorously
at the impositions of the Goode Report, there were bound to be suspicions
that the committee had bent too far towards compromise. The government still
has to respond. But in pension schemes any degree of risk at all is surely
unacceptable.

FT  22 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Invergordon bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whyte &amp; McKay finally made its long-awaited offer for Invergordon Distillers
following the purchase of a 13.5 per cent stake from Robert Fleming
Investment Management to take the US group's holding to nearly 55 per cent.
Whyte &amp; McKay has been sitting on a 41.3 per cent stake in the Scottish
whisky company for two years since its failed hostile bid at 275p a share.
Yesterday's renewed offer came at 300p a share, although market sources
hinted that some institutions approached previously by Whyte &amp; McKay had
been holding out for a higher bid. However, the US group said yesterday's
Pounds 382.4m offer was final. Most drinks analysts believed the price to be
a fair one, particularly in light of the dull global spirits market and the
threat of a Christmas price war brewing. Invergordon rose 3 to 297p.
The telecoms sector once again saw strident price moves, although it took
the arrival of US investors late in the day to fuel the bulk of the moves.
After almost a week of profit-taking, Vodafone jumped 15 to 561p, while
Cable and Wireless added the same at 963p. Dealers said the latter had been
helped by a Mercury pres-entation at Kleinwort Benson.
Reports of a stock overhang and a broker's downgrading in Inchcape brought a
sharp retreat for the shares. They were finally off 18 at 512p in trade of
3.5m, following a press report that a seller of around 4 per cent of the
company's shares had found few takers.
Sentiment was further hit by reports that James Capel had reduced its
current year forecast by Pounds 13m to Pounds 278m, and lowered the
following year's figure by Pounds 30m to Pounds 320m.
Water issues generally underperformed, with Credit Lyonnais Laing among
those advising a pause for breath ahead of the latest Ofwat report early
next month. North West dipped 5 to 554p, Severn Trent 7 1/2 to 559 1/2 p and
Wessex 9 to 665p.
Preferred instead were selected regional electricity stocks (Recs), among
which, London advanced 6 to 599p and Manweb 6 to 653p.
Allied-Lyons moved ahead 12 to 599p, spurred on by renewed enthusiasm from
Kleinwort Benson. Hoare Govett, meanwhile, was said to be equally bullish
over Bass as a 'quality yield stock'. The shares added 10 at 491p. Hoare and
Henderson Crosthwaite were also recommending Grand Metropolitan, up 4 at
423p.
The Bundesbank cut produced a strong performance by building stocks with
large exposure in Germany. Redland moved up 10 to 555p, while RMC added 16
to close at 838p.
Reflection and comment over hints from WH Smith on Wednesday that it was
considering restructuring its share system saw further gains, mainly in the
high-voting 'B's.
Smith has indicated to stores analysts that reforming the two-tier structure
was more likely to happen the higher the premium in the 'B's over the 'A's.
The 'B's closed 6 ahead at 104p and the 'A's a penny up at 480p.
Hopes of a UK interest rate cut, together with good retail sales figures,
which had lifted several stores stocks in the previous session, impacted on
some of those left behind yesterday. Next rose 4 to 199p, Sears 2 1/2 to 116
1/2 p and Stylo 6 to 197p.
Results from Albert Fisher disappointed market expectations and the shares
fell back 5 to 75p on big turnover of 9.9m. Food manufacturing analysts
trimmed their forecasts back to below Pounds 50m for next year amid cautious
remarks from the company.
Following a couple of high-profile sell notes against ICI, the stock put up
a strong fight to finish unchanged on the day at 709p after slipping in
early trading.
Strong support was seen late in the session and one analyst said that
persistent buying showed that investors were looking optimistically at the
company's long-term performance. Bearish sentiment has surrounded its
third-quarter figures, which are due to be announced next week.
BOC was out of favour and receded 11 to 660p. The company announced that it
was to reorganise its joint venture with Dow Chemical.
Enfranchisement plans helped Parkland Textiles to leap from 260p to 365p,
with the 'A' shares advancing 48 to 221p. A good recovery in profits also
provided a large amount of power behind the jump.
The failure to win in the European Cup on Wednesday hit Manchester United,
off 22 at 560p. Thorn EMI rallied after its recent drift, ending 12 better
at 921p.
A stock overhang combined with continued worries of a cut in defence
spending in next month's Budget hurt Vickers. The shares shed 5 to 146p.
International mining group RTZ strengthened 12 to 678p after a presentation
at Kleinwort Benson on Wednesday.
Fears that a win by the opposition in the Canadian federal election could
lead to the cancellation of a lucrative helicopter order weakened Westland
Group. The stock lost 4 at 216p.
BM Group edged a half-penny forward to 21p after its 75 per cent holding in
British Building &amp; Engineering Appliances of around 16m shares was placed
with institutions by broker Albert E Sharp.

FT  22 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Drugs strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Drugs stocks were among the best performers in the London market yesterday
as the caution that has hovered over the sector looked to be fast
dissolving.
The positive sentiment has been growing recently with a steady stream of
bullish comments - US broker Wertheim Schroder being the latest investment
house to become more positive on the sector. Yesterday the feeling
burgeoned, producing some squeezing in the stock and pushing prices higher.
While yields have been one attraction, another consideration is that some
stocks - particularly Wellcome and Zeneca - have underperformed the market
this year and attracted attention from those in the market who believe the
selling overdone.
Wellcome was one of the sector's strongest features yesterday, pushing well
past its important 800p level - the price at which the Wellcome Trust sold
its second tranche of shares to institutions - and closing at 823p, a rise
of 36 1/2 on the day. With volume at 3.5m there was some feeling that a
shortage of stock helped to boost the price increase.
The stock was also still benefiting from recent drug test results. Market
anticipation is also growing ahead of Wellcome's results next week. And, as
a great deal of the activity in the stock came after the opening of Wall
Street, some industry specialists suggested US interest was also growing.
Glaxo moved ahead in strong volume of 8.7m, making a gain of 23 at 723p. One
analyst said that yield factors lay behind the performance. SmithKline
Beecham 'A' added 12 1/2 at 434 1/2 p and Zeneca appreciated 4 1/2 to 783
1/2 p.

FT  22 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Heaviest trade in Rothmans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE spotlight in the market yesterday fell on Rothmans International 'B'
stock, which recorded its most active ever trading session ahead of the
company's restructuring into two separate groups that takes effect on
Monday.
A ruling by the Stock Exchange means that new shares issued by Rothmans and
Vendome, following the reorganisation of the tobacco and luxury goods
empire, will not be included in the UK stock market indices.
Several large blocks of shares were sold early in the session, with dealers
pointing to index tracking funds, which have been sellers for most of this
week, taking advantage of the strong market trend to exit the stock.
However, most of the shares on offer were quickly mopped up by the income
funds eager to take advantage of the big yield premium in the stock and it
was that demand, accompanied by a buy recommendation from Smith New Court,
which led to a squeeze around midday, sending the shares climbing 32 to a
day's peak of 629p.
Profit-taking during the afternoon saw the shares surrender some of the
earlier gain to finish 24 ahead at 621p. Turnover rose to a hefty 19.1m,
against the stock's daily average of around 500,000.

FT  22 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING in Footsie futures was vigorous after the German cut in interest
rates, whipping up the December contract to a new high with a strong premium
against cash, writes Christine Buckley.
Persistent rumours in equity derivatives that a cut in home base rates is
imminent sprang into life again after Germany's action, taking December on a
swift journey upwards. Such was the strength of the conviction that some
market watchers expected a half-point cut would be announced by the Bank of
England this morning.
The fever was further fired by strong European markets and trading was
virtually one-way traffic for all of the session after the Bundesbank's
announcement. Institutions, who have largely kept to the sidelines in recent
sessions, weighed into the action. By the close, they had helped take the
volume up to 14,869 contracts - the highest amount in recent trading.
December had opened firmly at 3,164 and charted a steady course upwards
before easing back a little by mid-morning. The German fillip gave it more
vigour and it ended on its high of the day at 3,220  - a lead of more than
20 points over the fair value premium to cash, which is about 15 points.
Volume reached in after-hours was a hefty 17,541 contracts.
Index options were active with 16,720 lots dealt out of a total traded
options volume of 37,384.

FT  22 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares surge after German rate cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL THE major UK equity market indices powered ahead to new records
yesterday as the big international institutions responded to the move by
Germany's Bundesbank in cutting its key interest rates.
The German move was seen by London brokers as ensuring a reduction in UK
rates in the near future. London trading desks were buzzing with rumours
during the late afternoon that a meeting had been called at the Bank of
England to consider an immediate reduction of  1/2 percentage point this
morning, with a further half-point cut at the time of the November 30
Budget.
At the close of an extremely tense and volatile session in the City, the
FT-SE 100 Index had reached a new intraday and closing high of 3,188.3, up
32 points. The index has risen almost 100 points over the past five trading
days as the market began to scent a move to lower interest rates across
Europe, starting with Germany. Moves to lower rates by other European
countries, notably France and the UK, are expected shortly, according to
dealers.
The burst of strength in the London equity market was not confined to the
top 100 stocks, although much of the initial flurry of buying interest was
carried out in these highly liquid shares. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index closed at
a peak 3,526.2, up 19.1.
Turnover in UK equities erupted during an afternoon of increasingly frantic
trading, eventually reaching a heavy 745.6m shares, the highest since
October 6, with activ-ity in the leaders accounting for almost half the
market business.
Dealers said customer, or retail, business increased sharply yesterday and
they expect the value of customer trading to top the Pounds 1.5bn figure
achieved on Wednesday. Customer business has remained well above usual
levels all this week, having reached Pounds 1.8bn last Friday, itself the
heaviest figure since late August.
Market sentiment at the close of business was a far cry from the initial
tone in the City yesterday morning. Dealers remained wary of the chances of
a German rate cut and continued to fret over the possibility of a sharp
correction on Wall Street in the near future.
Share prices opened marginally higher but began to slip back as the Footsie
future moved lower, dragging the underlying 100-share index to the day's low
of 3,149.3 in mid-morning. Thereafter, very little actual business
transpired, with marketmakers trying to smooth out any awkward book
positions ahead of the Bundesbank council meeting while all the time
expecting the German bank to hold rates and the market to move lower.
The market's immediate reaction to the twin rate cut was to hold steady for
a matter of minutes before embarking on a strong upward push to its eventual
closing record.
Some of the leading marketmaking firms in the City are believed to have been
wrong-footed by the steep rise in share prices over the past two weeks, with
short positions said to have been increasingly exposed in the past couple of
sessions.
Late yesterday it was said that some of the big UK institutions had pushed
some panicky buying orders into a sharply rising market. 'The market
exploded yesterday, which means there was a small panic; we are in for a
vol-atile few days,' said one top marketmaker.

FT  22 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow retreats after an opening
upbeat note
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AMID A flurry of corporate earnings reports and a sell-off in the bond
market, US stock prices retreated yesterday after briefly flirting with
record high levels, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 8.94 easier at 3,636.16 and the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off 0.71 at 465.36. Secondary markets were more
resilient, with the American SE composite firming 0.93 to 477.52 and the
Nasdaq composite 3.03 higher at 771.28. NYSE volume was 287.2m shares.
The session opened on an upbeat note following the decision by the German
central bank to cut interest rates by  1/2 percentage point. The move
appeared to improve prospects for US export opportunities to Europe.
However, attention was mostly focused on a rash of quarterly reports, which
were mixed to slightly better than expected, and equities registered early
gains.
As the morning progressed, share prices began to slip into negative
territory, with investors taking their cue from an accelerating sell-off in
US Treasuries. Long-dated bond prices fell sharply after the release of the
Philadelphia Federal Reserve's Business Outlook Survey, which showed a surge
in economic activity in the region. Bond traders interpreted the data as a
signal of renewed inflationary pressure.
In the afternoon, share prices managed to regain momentum before taking a
second downturn in the last hour of trading.
Banking issues were given a boost by a strong earnings report from Bankers
Trust, up Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 79 1/4 after its announcement of an 86 per
cent increase in net income.
The positive sentiment also gave a lift to Chemical, Dollars  5/8 higher at
Dollars 42. Citibank put on Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 37 5/8 and Chase
Manhattan was ahead Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 34 7/8 . Bankamerica recovered
some ground lost in Wednesday's session, rising Dollars 1 to Dollars 43 1/2
.
Dow Chemical was active and tumbled Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 56 3/8 , even
though its third-quarter earnings of 50 cents a share were in line with
analysts' expectations.
Caterpillar climbed Dollars 2 3/4 to a 52-week high of Dollars 85 7/8 after
the heavy equipment maker posted third-quarter operating income of 95 cents
a share, well ahead of the consensus forecast of 57 cents.
Telecommunications and technology issues were mixed. AT&amp;T shed Dollars 1 1/4
to Dollars 59 3/4 after reporting that its NCR operation had fallen into
loss in the third quarter.
Contributing to the Nasdaq advance, MCI gained Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 28
1/2 on news of a robust performance in the last three months.
However, Microsoft dropped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 79 1/2 amid concern over
weakening growth at the software company.
Among energy companies issuing quarterly reports, Amoco declined Dollars 1
1/8 to Dollars 55 5/8 , while Mobil was unchanged at Dollars 80 5/8.
Canada
TORONTO closed lower in busy dealings as the recent rally in gold prices
stalled. The TSE 300 index fell 19 points to 4,163.2. Declining issues
outnumbered advances by 384 to 330. Volume was 63.7m shares.
Ten of the 14 sub-indices declined, led by the gold group, off 2.6 per cent
as the bullion price slipped 70 cents an ounce in New York to USDollars
371.85, after rising about USDollars 8 earlier this week.

FT  22 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei flat as region
scores four new highs
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOST investors retreated to the sidelines to wait for next week's listing of
East Japan Railway, and the Nikkei average closed marginally higher after
prices had moved within a narrow trading range, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei was finally up 6.00 at 20,179.42 after a day's low of 20,108.81
and high of 20,219.72. Public fund managers and arbitrageurs were
late-morning buyers, but index-linked selling later eroded most of the
gains. Volume totalled 228m shares, against 223m, as falls overwhelmed rises
by 722 to 289, with 167 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first
section stocks shed 2.30 to 1,645.56. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
edged up 0.80 to 1,288.86.
Market participants anticipate that the JR East listing next Tuesday will
help to activate the market, and also expect that a successful listing will
prompt the lifting of an informal ban on new public share offerings, which
has been in place since March 1990.
Telecommunications-related stocks lost ground on profit-taking. NTT receded
Y13,000 to Y871,000 and DDI, on the second section, relinquished Y158,000 to
Y6.51m.
Game makers were lower on reports of shrinking profits: Sega Enterprises
fell Y500 to Y9,250, Konami Y150 to Y3,740 and Namco Y100 to Y2,800.
Higher prices in pharmaceutical issues in New York encouraged investors:
Takeda Chemical rose Y10 to Y1,330 and Yamanouchi Y30 to Y2,370.
In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 70.90 to 22,085.22 in volume of 15.4m
shares. The index lost ground for the fourth straight day as small-lot
profit-taking depressed share prices.
Roundup
THE region geared up again, scoring four more new highs.
NEW ZEALAND saw a 14-cent gain in Fletcher Challenge to NZDollars 3.77 on
plans to divest itself of non-core assets.
Other significant contributions came from a 4-cent bounce in Telecom to
NZDollars 4.33 and a 3-cent rise in Carter Holt Harvey to NZDollars 3.59.
The NZSE-40 index hit its highest point since November 23, 1989, ending
27.15, or 1.3 per cent, higher at 2,087.41 in turnover of more than
NZDollars 70m.
KUALA LUMPUR's KLSE composite index rose 14.14, or 1.5 per cent, to a
closing peak of 937.09 on strong institutional buying of core stocks. Volume
was some 643m shares.
According to analysts, news that Mr Ghafar Baba had withdrawn from the UMNO
party polls, paving the way for Finance Minister Mr Anwar Ibrahim to become
deputy prime minister, gave the market a strong push.
JAKARTA closed firmer in active trading, the JKSE index finishing 3.22 ahead
at a 1993 high of 466.31. MANILA reported heavy buying by both foreign and
local fund managers as the composite index peaked again, closing 41.68
higher at 2,247.46.
AUSTRALIA was led forward by golds, and bargain hunting elsewhere. The All
Ordinaries index gained 8.7 at 2,060.4 in turnover of ADollars 486.3m, with
golds up 65.0 at 2,212.9.
HONG KONG tried to climb but profit-taking left it slightly lower, the Hang
Seng index losing a net 20.12 at 8,882.68 after an intraday peak of
9,044.71. Turnover shrank from HKDollars 7.30bn to HKDollars 6.46bn.
Interest moved to quality second liners with China connections, Shougang
International rising 40 cents to HKDollars 4.30 ahead of today's interim
results.
BOMBAY fell on fears that there would be snags in the plan by which
proxy-held shares, seized by the income tax department on supposition that
they belonged to persons accused in India's biggest financial scandal, would
be allowed to be transferred to genuine buyers. The BSE index closed 57.6
lower at 2,683.0.

FT  22 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt and Paris differ on
Buba cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank's surprise cut in discount and Lombard rates hit bourses at
different times, and to different degrees yesterday afternoon, writes Our
Markets Staff.
French equities, the UK investors' choice in recent years, moved fast, and
further than other senior bourses. Germany, intriguingly, seemed to be
declining at one point in the afternoon, but ended with a late surge on
American money.
FRANKFURT saw the rate cuts before the official close but failed to react,
the DAX index falling 6.88 to 2,035.68 on the session as German stock market
turnover eased from DM9.8bn to DM9.5bn.
In the post-bourse, however, the Ibis indicated DAX closed at 2,048.05. Mr
Patrick Bettscheider, head of equity sales at Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt,
said that German fund managers had been sceptical about the effects of the
rate cuts  - Deutsche Bank, down DM4.50 to DM833 at the official close, fell
another DM3 to DM830 at one point  - but that US fund managers came in late
in the day.
The buying had been phenomenal, he said: 'I've seen bigger US orders for
individual stocks recently than I've seen in the past for the whole market'.
Post bourse recoveries took Deutsche Bank back up to around DM837, Siemens
by DM4 to DM720.50 and Thyssen by DM6 to DM224.
Hoechst fell DM6.10 to DM277.40 after announcing a slide of one-third in
operating profits from its pharmaceuticals business.
PARIS welcomed the news from Frankfurt with a gain in the CAC-40 index of
50.04 or 2.3 per cent to 2,199.72. Turnover was strong at an estimated
FFr6bn.
The Buba announcement at midsession was the news that French investors had
been waiting for since it makes a cut in domestic interest rates imminent.
Among financials, SocGen added FFr19 to FFr706, Suez FFr6.80 to FFr363.40
and UAP FFr29 to FFr660. BNP continued to attract buyers on news that it
will be included in the CAC-40 index from next month, gaining FFr4.20 to
FFr283.10.
BSN rose FFr11 to FFr896 in spite of announcing a 3 per cent decline in
turnover to the end of September after the close of trading on Wednesday.
LVMH gained FFr55 to FFr3,778 as it announced that it was forming a joint
venture with Guinness, its UK partner, to sell spirits in China.
L'Oreal was up FFr24 at FFr1,209 and reported a rise in first half profit
after the close.
ZURICH was propelled higher by the Buba news in active trading. The Swiss
National Bank quickly followed, cutting its discount rate by 0.25 of a
percentage point to 4.25 per cent.
In addition, the rise in the dollar triggered in part by the German rate cut
also helped lift shares of companies with large exposures to the US
currency. The SMI index finished 21.7 higher at 2,690.1, with Swissair SFr26
higher at SFr726, SBC up SFr14 at ASFr489, and Brown Boveri SFr14 higher at
FFr990.
AMSTERDAM built on early gains, and accelerated towards the close as the
central bank announced that it would cut three key rates from today. The CBS
Tendency index put on 1.8 or 1.3 per cent to 135.7.
Nedlloyd was one of the day's biggest gainers, up Fl 4.60 at Fl 53.60, as a
large block of shares unexpectedly came to the market and were quickly
seized by foreign buyers.
KLM put on 90 cents to Fl 43.40. The airline said that it was to integrate
its cargo activities in the Netherlands with its US partner, Northwest
Airlines.
Ahold, the retailer, slightly lagged behind with a rise of 20 cents to Fl
93.60. Some brokers have recently turned sellers of the stock ahead of its
third quarter results in December, partly because of a possible downtrend in
sales in the US.
MADRID was busy, turnover climbing another Pta4.6bn to Pta29.6bn as the
general index rose 1.87 to 305.18. Traders said that the market did little
until lunchtime and that, when it did, interest was still directed at the
high yield electrical utilities, Endesa among them.
Bank results left Santander and BBV more or less flat on figures below
expectations but Argentaria, with a good progress report, Pta110 higher at
Pta5,950. Endesa rose Pta130 to Pta6,130.
MILAN was little moved by events elsewhere on the continent as investors
remained depressed by the weight of rights issues coming on to the market in
the current trading period.
The Comit index rose 1.48 to 589.73.
Olivetti rose L9 to L1,882 helped by interest in Cir, the industrial holding
company, which gained L33 to L1,608.
In telecommunications Sip and Stet went in opposite directions, the former
adding L5 to L3,642 and the latter losing L4 to L4,134.
Among the financials, Generali rose L26 to L39,676.
STOCKHOLM was another beneficiary from the German rate cut with the
Affarsvarlden general index gaining 25.80 or 1.8 per cent to 1,411.30 in
turnover of SKr2.2bn. Ericsson B shares rose SKr8 to SKr448.
COPENHAGEN was also stronger with Carlsberg seeing a gain of 2.6 per cent to
DKr276 in good turnover of DKr70m. The KFX index closed up 1.10 at 103.05.
Elsewhere, Novo Nordisk, the pharmaceutical group, added DKr5 to DKr635.
ISTANBUL fell back 1 per cent as many investors remained uncertain as to the
future direction of the market. The composite index lost 154.6 to 14,826.8.

FT  22 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: Bangkok takes stock of global rally in
equities - William Barnes assesses the current situation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thailand's stock brokers are as bemused as anyone in Asia about the wave of
foreign, notably US, money that has washed over the stock market since the
end of September.
The SET index climbed to a new all-time high this week of 1,160.95, before
some mild profit-taking yesterday took it down 4.56 to 1,153.32.
Mr Peter Schiefelbein, chief representative of Standard Chartered
Securities, says: 'Liquidity-driven markets are difficult to predict, so
trying to choose an upside limit for this rally is fruitless.'
Mr Scott Klimo, head of research at Smith New Court Far East, adds: 'You
have to look at this in the broader Asia context  - with US investment we
may have to get used to these markets on different ratings than we have
grown accustomed to. Does US investment, for example, add two or three
points on to the price/earnings ratios for these markets?'
The market still looks reasonably cheap on a regional basis with a p/e ratio
of 18.3 times for 1993 earnings and 16.3 times for 1994 earnings, based on
forecasts by Baring. This compares with Malaysia on 25.5 times 1993 earnings
and Singapore on 26 times.
But setting aside the banking sector changes the p/e ratios to 22 times for
this year and 20 times for 1994.
Mr David Robinson, managing director of Baring Research in Bangkok, says
there is concern that the Thai market is now acquiring some speculative
froth. 'If you do not believe that institutional flows (from the US, Europe
and Japan) are going to continue, then you have got to be a bear; the
recovery in the economy or in earnings does not justify current ratings,' he
maintains.
However, some brokers dismiss as 'myth' talk of foreign money driving the
Thai market through the roof. One broking house managing director pointed
out that the current upswing started long before the late-September/October
injection of foreign money.
Overnight money currently collecting 2 to 3 per cent makes the stock
market's 4 per cent yield look attractive to locals.
Baht interest rates appear hardly likely to stiffen in the near future given
surplus liquidity of between Bt50bn to Bt70bn (Dollars 2bn to Dollars
2.8bn).
No significant fundamental changes have taken place recently to steel the
nerves of investors scared earlier this year by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, which rounded up some 30 alleged share manipulators, followed by
the 'accidental' leaking of the names of 123 suspects.
No sooner did a rather deflated market pop its collective head above the
parapet than it was battered by dreadful first-quarter results: from a peak
of 998 in January the SET index hit bottom this summer at around 820.
Encouraged by relative pol-itical stability, lukewarm half-year results and
the Bank of Thailand's confidence that its 7.5 per cent growth target for
the year was achievable with low inflation, local investors took the market
towards the 1,000 level in October when foreign funds leapt into the fray.
As elsewhere in Asia the money wave injected new life into smaller stocks
and special situations whose balance sheets would not have been entertained
by fund managers a year ago.
Although a correction, even an uncomfortable one, before the next advance
would surprise none, several research-driven houses moot a level of 1,300 or
1,400 for the SET index before the end of the year.
However, the head of one brokerage house in Bangkok says that his best
negative indicator has already been triggered: 'I get worried when
journalists phone up and start asking about the market, because then you are
always near a high.'

FT  22 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange: DM lower on German rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCIAL markets shifted gear yesterday as foreign exchange dealers were
taken aback by a surprise rate cut by the German Bundesbank, writes Peter
John.
The decision to reduce the lower level discount rate to 5.75 per cent from
6.25 per cent, the upper level Lombard rate to 6.75 per cent from 7.25 per
cent and the 14-day securities repurchase rate to 6.4 per cent from 6.67 per
cent led to a sharp fall for the D-Mark against leading currencies.
It also prompted a rash of rate cuts throughout continental Europe, with
expectations of more to come. Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, Italy and the
Netherlands all followed Germany's lead.
The Bundesbank announced a press conference yesterday but few economists
anticipated any shift in key rates after Wednesday's variable repo was only
reduced by three basis points to 6.67 per cent.
When the rate news broke there was a wave of heavy short-term speculative
selling of the D-Mark to buy dollars which sent the US currency up by a
pfennig. That strength was followed through and dealers said the previous
ceiling for the dollar of around DM1.6550 had now become the new floor. It
closed nearly two pfennigs up at DM1.6635, and went on to end in New York at
DM1.6671.
The D-Mark's loss was the pound's gain in spite of growing conviction that
the UK chancellor will cut base rates soon, possibly by as much as one
percentage point, and therefore reduce the returns for holders of sterling.
The pound ended 2.25 pfennigs higher at DM2.4725. The fact that sterling's
rise reflected the German currency's weakness was underlined by its close
against the dollar, down at Dollars 1.4870 from Dollars 1.49.
By contrast, the Belgian franc, which has been the focus of speculative
attacks over the past fortnight, failed to recover spectacularly. An early
rally was undermined by news that unions had pulled out of negotiations on
the social pact to hold down wages and reduce jobs.
It was not until the National Bank of Belgium reduced its central rate to
9.4 per cent from 9.65 per cent and its discount rate by  1/2 percentage
point to 6 per cent that the currency showed some signs of life. It had
rallied by the close to BFr21.67 to the D-Mark, up from a previous BFr21.86.
The French franc gained two centimes against the D-Mark to FFr3.5120. Mr
Brian Hilliard of SGST, the French owned securities house, said: 'The fact
that the franc appreciated will give the Bank of France heart that if it
cuts rates the franc will hold steady.'
The Dutch central bank cut official key rates by  1/4 percentage point and
lowered its short-term special advances money market rate to 6.1 per cent
from 6.4 per cent.
The Danish krone recovered on anticipation that the central bank would cut
its central rate from the current 8.5 per cent. The krone rose to DKr4.0255
to the D-Mark from DKr4.0592.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Money Markets: Rate cut hopes soar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE surprise decision by the German central bank to cut key interest rates
by  1/2 percentage point gave a fillip to European interest rate contracts
yesterday, writes Peter John.
The main beneficiary of the Bundesbank announcement was the French
three-month lending contract which, at one stage, jumped almost a third of a
point from its previous close.
France desperately needs lower interest rates to regenerate its economy and
the market was convinced yesterday that a reduction in the French
intervention rate, which sets the floor for French lending, would come very
shortly.
The futures contract for December finished 30 basis points higher on the day
at 93.76.
Belgium would also benefit greatly from lower rates and the Belgian December
futures contract rose 23 basis points to 92.30. Meanwhile, the German
December contract gained 12 basis points at 93.86.
The short sterling contract for December closed at its high of the day, 11
basis points stronger at 94.73.
One dealer said: 'The Bundesbank reduction makes a half-point cut in the UK
as near certain as you can get in market terms. It also increases the
possibility of a cut before the Budget. Finally, it increases the
flexibility of Mr Clarke to make a full one-point cut.'
Money market operations in the UK were tight yesterday, with the Bank of
England unable to attract any takers for the early round of assistance after
forecasting a liquidity shortage of around Pounds 1bn, later revised to
Pounds 1.05bn.
Among the main factors affecting the shortage were the take-up of Treasury
Bills and paper maturing in official hands which drained Pounds 473m from
the system. Exchequer transactions removed Pounds 380m, and a rise in note
circulation withdrew Pounds 135m.
The Bank only provided Pounds 14m of morning assistance, via band one bank
bills at the established rate of 5 7/8 per cent. It was not until the
afternoon that those with collateral were prepared to sell bills and the
Bank could buy Pounds 723m of band one bank bills at 5 7/8 per cent.
This still left a shortfall which was taken up with late assistance of
Pounds 225m at the unspecified rate.
The Bank of England announced that Banco Central Hispanoamericano had been
added to the list of eligible institutions.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Scientist challenges
conventional wisdom on nitrates in water
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RISING LEVELS of nitrate in water supplies are due primarily to natural
changes in the soil rather than to the use of fertilisers by farmers,
according to a leading British soil scientist.
Mr David Jenkinson, of Reading University and Rothamsted Experimental
Station in Hertfordshire, said that reducing fertiliser applications would
do little to control nitrate leaching. Money spent on cutting nitrate levels
in drinking water could have more medically useful outlets, he suggested.
Mr Jenkinson, who has been carrying out research at Rothamsted for 36 years,
was delivering the Massey Ferguson National Agricultural Lecture at the
Royal Society of Arts in London this week.
Most crops left negligible amounts of unused fertiliser in the soil at
harvest, according to a series of experiments begun in 1980, he said.
'Farmers spend some Pounds 350m on nitrogen fertilisers every year in the UK
 -we wanted to make sure they receive value for their money and that as
little as possible of the nitrogen ends up where it is not wanted.'
Most of the nitrate leached from arable land came from organic nitrogen
being broken down gradually into ammonium ions, which were then converted by
soil bacteria into nitrate ions, said Mr Jenkinson.
This nitrate remained in the soil, in danger of leaking into water supplies,
at times of the year when there were no growing crops to take it up.
Changes in farming - notably the increased land under crops and the rise in
soil fertility produced by both organic and inorganic fertilisers - had
allowed more of this natural nitrogen to turn to nitrate because
well-fertilised crops left more organic residues, containing more nitrogen,
than unfertilised crops.
Certain farming practices, such as excessive use of fertiliser or organic
manures, or the application of fertiliser nitrogen in the autumn as a crop
'starter', could contribute directly to nitrate leaching.
But no agriculture system could be rendered completely safe from the risk of
leaching, Mr Jenkinson said. Even soil that had not had any manure or
artificial fertiliser applied for 150 years still 'leaked' nitrate.
The problem could be lessened by cutting the time that soil remained bare in
the autumn and winter, for example by sowing winter cereals early or by
growing cover crops.
However, Mr Jenkinson argued that there was minimal medical evidence that
current levels of nitrate in drinking water were harmful. The last case of
'blue-baby syndrome' in the UK was recorded in 1972.
'Stomach cancer has been linked to nitrate in drinking water but the
epidemiological evidence is not in support,' he said. 'In the UK stomach
cancer is most common in areas where the nitrate concentration in drinking
water is lowest. Nitrate concentrations have been increasing in water
supplies, yet the incidence of stomach cancer has been decreasing.'
By 1995, water companies in England and Wales would have spent Pounds 164m
on meeting the EC nitrate limit of 50mg per litre. 'Risk-benefit analysis
suggests that there are far more medically useful ways to spend money than
by reducing nitrate levels in drinking water when money is in short supply,'
said Mr Jenkinson.
Turning to global warming, he said research at Rothamsted indicated that an
increase in temperature of 1.5 degrees centigrade over the next 60 years
would release an extra 1bn tonnes of carbon as carbon dioxide into the
atmosphere each year from soil organic matter.
This was in addition to the roughly 6bn tonnes of carbon released each year
by burning fossil fuels.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Survey reveals S Australia's
'staggering' mineral wealth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINING COMPANIES are expected to spend ADollars 25m (Pounds 11m) exploring
the state of South Australia in the next 12 months following the revelation
that, according to Mr Ross Fardon, director-general at the department of
mines and energy, some of the most abundant mineral resources are to be
found there under shallow cover.
He says the state has the potential to rank alongside Western Australia,
Chile and South Africa in the mining industry.
This follows a ADollars 16m geological survey - one of the most
comprehensive ever seen in the western world - carried out by the state
government. The survey was needed because two-thirds of South Australia is
covered by soil and sands which hide the mineral-bearing bedrock. However,
advanced aeromagnetic surveys are able to penetrate this cover.
'The results are staggering,' says Mr Fardon. 'We've discovered bedrock
terrains under shallow cover, which are equivalent to those containing the
giant mineral deposits at Broken Hill, Mount Isa and Olympic Dam, all
world-class deposits.'
About 500,000 square kilometres, an area the size of Spain, are being mapped
and tied in with other high-quality data and the details are being made
available at very little cost to exploration companies.
Mr Fardon is at present on a three-week tour of Europe and South Africa to
spread the word. 'We would welcome foreign expertise and money.'
So far about 30 per cent of the survey data has been released and
applications for exploration licences have trebled in the first eight months
of this year.
The early data also sparked a diamond rush after aeromagnetic and
radiometric pictures revealed about 60 geological 'bubbles' which closely
resemble diamond-bearing kimberlite pipes.
'We could be sitting on diamond resources comparable to the world's biggest
diamond mine at Argyle in Western Australia,' says Mr Fardon
enthusiastically.
About 10 companies have started a diamond search and are expected to spend
about ADollars 2m this year. They include De Beers' local subsidiary
Stockdale, CRA, Ashton Mining, and Poseidon.
The department of mines believes that the region could contain deposits of
gold, copper, lead, zinc, iron ore, nickel, chromium and tin in addition to
diamonds.
The main focus of interest is the Gawler Craton, a huge geological block
that stretches over the Eyre Peninsula and north beyond Coober Pedy.
Mr Fardon says: 'Foreign companies are welcome in their own right but we
would prefer them to joint venture with an Australian company. And to
acquire tenements they must have a registered company in Australia'.

COPPER prices fell back heavily in the afternoon on the London Metal
Exchange, pulling other base metals off their highs. Dealers said the
selling that engulfed the market led to copper buckling below the Dollars
1,650-a-tonne level (for three months delivery), where consolidation had
been attempted. The price finished at the day's low of Dollars 1,639 a
tonne, down Dollars 9 from Wednesday's final kerb close and Dollars 20 below
the day's high. The ALUMINIUM market was unsettled by the sell-off in
copper, with the three months price, which had touched Dollars 1,132 a
tonne, falling back below Dollars 1,120 to close at Dollars 1,119.50, still
up some Dollars 3 from Wednesday. At the London Commodity Exchange COFFEE
futures ended with good gains but off the day's highs. The January position
climbed to Dollars 1,219 a tonne but slipped to end Dollars 21 up on balance
at Dollars 1,216. Volume was light at 2,945 lots (5 tonnes each), of which
1,094 were crossed. Dealers said the market continued to be plagued by
rumours over whether Brazil would continue with the planned retention scheme
in the wake of the government corruption scandal.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa hit five-year high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cocoa prices at the London Commodity Exchange touched the highest levels for
more than five years yesterday, with the March futures position peaking at
Pounds 991 a tonne, writes Richard Mooney.
Most of the gain was surrendered, however, and the price closed at Pounds
975, up just Pounds 7 on the day.
As the market was rising dealers suggested to the Reuter news agency that it
had ended its recent 'correction' phase and resumed an uptrend based on
impending supply deficits and supported by a bullish chart formation.
Concern over the state of health of Ivory Coast President Felix
Houphouet-Boigny was also a background market factor, they added. The Ivory
Coast is the biggest cocoa producer.
Confidence appeared weaken with the later retreat, however. 'I don't think
it has sufficiently broken the recent high at Pounds 983 to warrant
short-term optimism,' one trader said. 'It must be looking to consolidate
now for a while.'
The retracement began after the New York market failed to sustain its firm
opening trend. The technical picture was still good, traders said. but New
York's unwillingness to continue the uptrend had sapped the strength of
London's rally.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tin price manipulation alleged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUGGESTIONS THAT the tin price was being manipulated upwards emerged
yesterday after the metal's price moved decisively through Dollars 5,000 a
tonne on the London Metal Exchange only one month after dropping to a
20-year low point of Dollars 4,360.
Metal for delivery in three months closed yesterday at Dollars 5,053, nearly
16 per cent above last month's low.
'Most of the recent price increase is artificial, the result of a
well-timed, concerted effort to boost the price,' said Ms Lesley Campbell,
analyst at Rudolf Wolff, the commodity broker. As the operation was centred
on the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market, rather than the LME, it was probable that
the manipulation was producer  - and not just merchant  - inspired, she
suggested in a special report.
Ms Campbell said the timing of the manipulation was perfect as the market
was oversold and nervous. But also the fundamental situation of the tin
market had changed in the past six weeks as mines had cut production of
concentrate (an intermediate product). The market had not responded to this
trend previously because refined metal is available from other sources such
as the US official stockpile and LME stocks, currently standing at 20,500
tonnes. 'The concentrate tightness could take another year to filter through
and give real support to prices,' said Ms Campbell.
Meanwhile, Reuter reported that delegates at a meeting of the Association of
Tin Producing Countries feared tin stocks could rise from 33,000 to 38,000
tonnes by the end of 1993 against an ATPC target of 20,000 tonnes.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa market 'near a turning
point'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NUSA DUA, BALI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECTS for the cocoa industry, beset by years of low prices and
over-production, are finally improving, according to speakers at the
International Conference on Cocoa Economy in Bali.
'We appear to be near a turning point with low prices depressing production
and stimulating consumption,' Mr S. Wateridge, Director of Research at ED &amp;
F. Man, the UK commodity trading house, told the conference yesterday.
Cocoa analysts note cocoa's world market price has risen more than 25 per
cent in three months to more than Pounds 950 a tonne and Mr Wateridge
predicted a further rise to Pounds 1,400 within 18 months.
'The production increases of the mid-1980s are no longer apparent, with the
exception of Indonesia,' said Mr Wateridge. 'Consumption has expanded
rapidly despite economic collapse in the former Soviet Union and recession
in western Europe and the USA.'
World production is forecast at 2.34m tonnes this year, up from the 1.8m
tonnes average of 1984-86. While world consumption in 1993 is forecast at
2.44m tonnes, it only rose above production levels a few years ago after
seven years of surpluses.
Delegates were split on how the industry's changing fortunes would affect
the proposed long-term production agreement discussed by producing nations
last July in Geneva. Following the Geneva meeting the International Cocoa
Organisation began a four-and-a-half year timetable to sell its stocks of
230,000 tonnes.
Most delegates agreed greater co-operation between producing nations was
required if prices rises were to be sustained beyond Pounds 1,400,
historically not a high price in real terms for cocoa. The proposed
agreement, however, has not yet been endorsed by Indonesia and Malaysia,
both major producers.
Indonesia's production surged from just 7,000 tonnes in 1980 to 180,000
tonnes last year and is forecast to double again by the end of the decade.
Some Indonesian delegates say a production agreement is not in their
interests and is unnecessary given the recent improvement in prices and
consumption.
While congratulating Indonesia on its record of growth, delegates also had
words of caution. Mr Anthony Lass, Head of Agricultural Affairs at Cadbury,
the UK confectionery company, said Indonesia must become 'quality conscious
as well' or its cocoa would continue to sell at a discount to the world
market.
Mr Wateridge warned that the extent of future price rises 'depends
critically on Indonesia'. Unless Indonesia curbed production growth it was
'likely to put a very low ceiling on the next up-turn in world prices'.
Cocoa producers must come to terms with tough new regulations among
consuming countries such as the US governing import quality, a senior US
trader told the conference, reports Reuter.
Mr Johann Scheu, president of the Cocoa Merchants' Association of America,
said new or newly-implemented regulations governing packaging, use of
pesticides and storage conditions were hurting both producer and supplier.
'These changing attitudes of the public, and hence of government, are making
life difficult for the cocoa trading and processing community,' he warned.
The US leads the world in imposing tough import restrictions on commodities
such as cocoa. Cocoa from three of the world's major exporters, Malaysia,
Indonesia and Brazil, face compulsory fumigation at the point of import,
raising costs for importers who pass it on in the form of lower bids.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tea planters find salvation in
samovars - Imports by CIS states have filled a yawning gap in Sri Lanka's
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD COWPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN ONE of the more theatrical gestures of his tenure as Russian president,
Boris Yeltsin last month stopped in the middle of his television broadcast
announcing his putsch against the communist old guard in parliament and
calmly sipped a cup of tea.
The chances are the tea came from Sri Lanka, for Colombo expects to sell
more than 30,000 tonnes to Russia and former Soviet states this year, making
the Commonwealth of Independent States by far the country's biggest customer
for of tea.
Everyone agrees that Russia and the CIS have come to Sri Lanka's rescue. Two
years ago Colombo lost its biggest market in Iraq because of the post-Gulf
war United Nations trade embargo and this year, with production expected to
be up 30 per cent on 1992, it suffered two further blows with sharp declines
in demand from Iran and Egypt.
Last year by far the largest proportion of Sri Lanka's 178,000 tonnes of tea
exports was shipped to the Middle East, with Iran in top place taking 24,000
tonnes, Jordan a close second, with nearly 22,000 tonnes, and Egypt third
with almost 17,000 tonnes. Iran and Egypt alone accounted for 23 per cent of
Sri Lankan exports, but in the first seven months of this year sales to
these two fell by half, while Russia and the CIS came from nowhere to take
19,100 tonnes  - or 16 per cent of all Colombo's exports.
By the end of this year Russia and the CIS are expected to have bought
upwards of 30,000 tonnes of Sri Lankan tea out of total exports of about
205,000 tonnes.
Traditionally, the former Soviet Union imported most of its tea from India
in a barter arrangement under which Russian arms were effectively for Indian
commodities. But with the break-up of the Soviet Union and arguments with
New Delhi over exchange rates the CIS has turned to the world market for its
annual requirements.
Sri Lanka was quick to spot the opportunity and mounted a strong export
drive, which has enabled Colombo to sell almost all of its cheaper tea to
this new market in 1993.
Mr Rupasena Karunatilleke, minister for plantation industries, visited
Russia in July and Mr AR Mansoor, the minister for trade, made a three-week
tour through Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Uzbekistan and the Ukraine in
September signing agreements with all five states to promote trade.
'The CIS pays cash and there is tremendous scope for exporting tea and other
commodities to these countries,' says Mr Mansoor.
The Russian market is highly attractive to Colombo for a variety of reasons,
including what the Sri Lankan Tea Board sees as the possibility of gaining
added value by direct marketing. According to Mr T. Sambasivam, a consultant
with the board, the main attractions include:
Russia traditionally absorbs about 160,000 tonnes of tea a year, mostly
orthodox teas of which Sri Lanka is by far the world's biggest exporter.
The CIS and Russia pay cash.
Deteriorating economic circumstances means these countries want the cheapest
quality tea, which suits Sri Lanka because it can offload traditional teas
which otherwise might be difficult to sell.
Russia has few factories for packaging and labelling into consumer packs  -
a field in which Colombo has great expertise.
No multinational drinks company has an entrenched position in Russia, nor
does one single brand dominate the market.
Mr Sambasivam says if all goes well the hope is to export up to 40,000
tonnes to Russia and the CIS next year when it is hoped that Sri Lanka's
newly-appointed plantation managers will have further boosted the country's
tea output to a record 250,000 tonnes, weather permitting.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Government Bonds: German base rate cuts trigger wave of
easing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank took Europe's government bond markets by surprise with a
half-point cut in key interest rates yesterday, triggering a wave of easing
in the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy and Austria, while raising
hopes of rate cuts in France, Denmark and possibly Spain.
The main trend of the day was a shift out of long-dated bonds in Germany and
France into short-dated paper, leading to a steepening of yield curves, as
investors hoped to benefit from the easing in rates.
In Germany, the bund futures contract fell on the rate cut announcement,
then perked up again before falling back to close lower on the day. Having
opened at 100.47, it reached a high of 100.57, and ended at 100.06.
The cut in German interest rates led to speculation that inflation data due
over the next few days will show an improvement and the next batch of money
supply figures will show a fall.
The shift towards short-dated paper was partly triggered by comments by Mr
Tietmeyer, the president of the Bundesbank, that he sees little room for
further a drop in long-term interest rates.
HIGH-YIELDING European bond markets rallied on hopes of lower rates and
yield spreads over the German 10-year bund narrowed to their lowest levels
for Spain, Italy and Portugal. After the market closed, the Bank of Italy
cut its discount rate by half a point.
In Portugal, demand at the Treasury's auction of 10-year bonds was so strong
that the auction size was increased from Es15bn to Es50bn. The average yield
at the auction was 8.796 per cent. However, the market closed slightly lower
on profit-taking.
UK government bonds picked up on hopes of lower interest rates, with short
and medium-dated gilts gaining about a quarter point.
The gilt market largely ignored the release of disappointing trade figures
yesterday morning - which showed that the non-EC trade gap increased last
month to its highest level since February - and took its inspiration instead
from the Bundesbank.
The news from Germany reignited hopes of a cut in UK base rates, especially
as sterling rose against the D-Mark, but economists warned that the Bank of
England was unlikely to cut before the November 30 budget.
The Liffe gilt future contract reached 115.20 but closed up 0.04 on the day
at 115.07. Long-dated gilts closed little changed or slightly lower.
JAPANESE government bonds tested new highs on hopes of lower money market
rates, but traded down during the course of the session to close lower on
the day.
Short-dated cash bonds remained firm while futures and long-dated cash bonds
headed lower, leading to a steepening of the yield curve.
US Treasury bonds, led by the long end of the yield curve, suffered a big
setback as the market reacted to fresh evidence that the US economy was
picking up steam.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was down 1 7/16 to 104 5/8 ,
yielding 5.913 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was 1/16 lower
at 100 1/32 , to yield 3.840 per cent.
The market opened on a soft note, but the negative sentiment accelerated in
response to the release of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's Business
Outlook Survey, which showed economic activity in the region had surged over
the past month.
The reaction by traders indicated their concern over renewed inflationary
pressures in the coming months.
The decision to cut German interest rates did little to buoy the market. If
anything, it served to raise fears that European central banks were set to
stimulate their economies more aggressively.

FT  22 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: HK convertibles find wide
appeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HONG KONG companies, cashing in on the burgeoning economic appeal of China,
are falling over themselves in the rush to issue convertible bonds.
Wharf Holdings set the ball rolling in June with a HKDollars 400m
Euroconvertible bond, since when the number of issues has mushroomed, as
companies take advantage of low interest rates and a strong Hong Kong stock
market.
Mr Edward Cheng, finance director of Wharf, said: 'Everyone is happy. The
company gets cheap finance, the shareholders don't get substantially
diluted, and the international investors get exposure to Asian equities.'
Two years ago, this sort of financing would have been unthinkable. Wharf's
convertible has a seven-year term, so it straddles the 1997 hand-over of
Hong Kong to China.
This is an event which international investors have until recently viewed
with profound unease.
The major change has been the perception of economic growth in neighbouring
China, both by Hong Kong companies and outside investors.
In Hong Kong, companies have traditionally maintained low debt ratios.
However, the move to raise exposure to the future sovereign nation has
rapidly gathering pace as economic revolution in China is increasingly
considered to be irreversible.
Property developers have been the most active borrowers, having signed up
land sites and infra-structural projects in China, at a time when high Hong
Kong property prices have limited their access to credit lines from a
nervous banking sector.
For overseas investors, China was the reason for the traditionally low
valuations of the Hong Kong stock market, but it has now become a major
attraction at a time when the cash balances of international institutions
are at record levels.
US and European investors have been driven out of bonds and commercial debt
in their domestic markets, so the offer of higher yielding instruments with
an equity kicker into a fast growing equity market, is proving an easily
saleable alternative.
So far this year, Hong Kong companies have raised more than HKDollars 2.15bn
through nine issues of either convertible bonds, or preference shares, and a
further HKDollars 250m from a Eurobond issue.
This compares with HKDollars 1.02bn raised through rights issues, and
HKDollars 2.99bn through straight equity placements in the first nine months
of the year, making it a substantial portion of this year's capital raising.
The success of early issues is rapidly catching on. Initial issuers were
blue chip property investment or development companies, such as Wharf, Amoy
Properties, Sun Hung Kai Properties and Sino Land, and mainland-backed
companies, such as Guangzhou Investment and Guangdong Investment.
However, the latest confirmed issue is by Johnson Electric, a manufacturer
of micro-motors, which is raising HKDollars 125m through a convertible bond.
Two other second-line companies, Shun Tak and HKR International, have also
announced plans to raise a total of HKDollars 300m: their success will
indicate the depth of the potential market, and the likelihood of a far
broader range of issues.
In the meantime, convertible issuers are gaining a further positive side
affect. Hong Kong investors are generally averse to the diluting effects of
equity share placements, and they have, therefore, welcomed the availability
of short-term financing to companies in exchange for long-term dilution at a
much higher price  - the convertibles have switched into equity at a premium
of more than 20 per cent to the current market price.
The share prices of issuing companies have performed accordingly and, since
the management in Hong Kong companies tends also to be the controlling
shareholder, the convertible issue is becoming an increasingly beguiling
formula.

FT  22 OCT 93 / International Bonds: Sweden to raise Dollars 1bn through
seven-year global FRN issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE irreversible trend towards a global bond market gathered momentum
yesterday when the Kingdom of Sweden announced its intention to raise at
least Dollars 1bn through a three-year issue of global floating-rate notes
(FRNs).
Several sovereign borrowers have issued FRNs in the Eurobond market this
year but Sweden's forthcoming deal, which will be jointly led by Lehman
Brothers and JP Morgan, marks the first sovereign global FRN offering.
The joint leads of Sweden's deal said that demand among international
investors for FRNs was firmly established. In addition, there was growing
interest among domestic US investors for this kind of paper in view of the
perception that US interest rates were close to the bottom of their cycle.
The joint leads declined to comment on the pricing of the notes, but the
market expects Sweden to achieve an all-in cost of five or six basis points
below the London interbank offered rate (Libor).
Among yesterday's issues, two banks took advantage of continued investor
demand for high-yielding paper to raise subordinated debt in the Eurobond
market.
HSBC Holdings raised lower tier-two capital through a Dollars 250m issue of
collared FRNs due 2008 while Societe Generale raised upper tier-two capital
through a Pounds 100m issue of undated Eurobonds.
However, both issues are likely to be called in 2003, given the penal nature
of the step-up which comes into effect in that year.
The structure of HSBC's issue enabled the bank to make the most effective
use of capital under international banking guidelines. Rather than starting
to be amortised after five years, the structure allows the entire proceeds
of the issue to count as capital for 10 years.
In addition, HSBC achieved an all-in cost of funds of Libor plus 40 to 50
basis points, which represented a big improvement since March when it paid
Libor plus 100 basis points for 10-year funds raised in the US domestic
market.
HSBC's bonds pay six-month Libor minus 25 basis points, but since Libor is
currently at 3 1/4 per cent, investors will receive the minimum interest
rate on the notes of 5 per cent.
Elsewhere, the recent flow of Euroconvertible bond issues from emerging
markets continued as Reliance Industries, India's largest private-sector
company, raised Dollars 125m through an issue of six-year convertible bonds.
Lead manager Morgan Stanley said the issue was already several times
oversubscribed and there was strong demand from foreign institutions who
have permission from the Indian government to invest directly in Indian
companies.

FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: Firmer prices bolster Anglo
American gold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FIRMER gold price, offset by a modest production performance, helped the
gold mines managed by the Anglo American group, the world's largest
producer, increase available profit by 7.2 per cent to R269.2m (Dollars
80.36m) in the September quarter, from R251.1m a year ago.
Mr Clem Sunter, chairman of the gold and uranium division, attributed the
lower-than-expected increase to the high base of the June quarter.
'The previous quarter was really outstanding. It was difficult for us to
improve on that, but we have done it and that's due to the gold price,' he
said.
Gold production was lower at every mine in the group compared with the June
quarter, and fell overall by 3 per cent to 65,773kg from 67,803kg. This
contributed to a rise in unit costs at all mines, with the average across
the group 7.2 per cent higher at R28,930 per kg against R26,982 per kg.
The average revenue for the quarter rose 8.2 per cent to R39,320 per kg from
R36,327 per kg.
The group also announced yesterday that its Free State operation, Freegold,
would be developing a new R540m shaft. The new shaft, to be known as
Freddie's No 4, will produce an estimated 106 tonnes of gold during its
19-year production life-span.
It is expected to yield 80,000m tonnes per month, at an estimated recovered
grade of 7.24 grams/tonne. The shaft will reach full production in 2002.
The best performer in the group was Freegold, where available (after-tax and
capital expenditure) profit rose to R121.4m from R102.5m. Vaal Reefs
suffered the effects of an underground sit-in during the quarter, and
profits fell to R63.8m from R70.7m.
At Western Deep Levels, profits rose to R42.5m from R38.1m. At Elandsrand,
they increased marginally to R29.4m from R28.7m. Ergo, the dump treatment
operation, made a R12.1m profit.

FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: Nissan extends shake-up at
troubled Spanish unit

<TEXT>
NISSAN, the Japanese carmaker, is looking to restructure its Spanish
subsidiary, Nissan Motor Iberica, further and cut the workforce by 16 per
cent over the next two years.
It faces a further capital restructuring of the troubled Spanish
majority-owned company, which is expected to involve a write-down of a
significant part of its equity capital to comply with Spanish law on
corporate solvency.
The heavy losses have wiped out a large part of the company's net worth, and
the losses in the second half of the year are expected to equal the
first-half deficit.
The Japanese carmaker had been planning to inject Pta10bn (Dollars 75.6m) in
new equity into the company. However its room for financial action is being
severely constrained by mounting losses in Japan.
Nissan has asked its Spanish labour unions to consider a company proposal to
eliminate a further 500 jobs in addition to the 600 it had already planned.
It is also asking its unions to accept a wage freeze for 1994.
The moves by Nissan highlight the increasing difficulties Japanese carmakers
face in western Europe, where new car sales have fallen by 16 per cent in
the first nine months of this year.
Nissan, which was the first Japanese carmaker to start manufacturing in
Europe, has recently announced it will also have to halve output at its
Sunderland car plant in the UK. The company has already adjusted production
in Spain by introducing an average of 11 extra holidays in October and
November.
Nissan said production at its Spanish operations, which made a Pta23bn loss
in the first half of 1993, would fall by about 4,000 units to 86,000 units
this year. Actual production between January and September came to 60,000.
In the UK, meanwhile, production plans have been revised down to 246,000
from the 270,000 forecast at the beginning of the year. Capacity at
Sunderland is around 300,000 a year.
Nissan is facing severe pressure at home as well, where it is reducing the
age for voluntary retirement to 45 from 50 in an attempt to cut its domestic
workforce from 53,000 to 48,000 by 1995.
Like many other Japanese companies, Nissan needs to reduce the number of
middle-aged white collar employees. Lowering the voluntary retirement age
requirement for these workers to 45 would add another 1,000 employees to
those already eligible.

profits sharply

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KAO, a leading Japanese household products maker, saw a firm rise in profits
for the first six months to September, in spite of a sharp fall in consumer
spending due to the prolonged economic slump.
The company attributed its profit rise to firm sales of new products and a
realignment of production lines. Non-consolidated pre-tax profits for the
first half rose 8 per cent to Y22.9bn (Dollars 213m) on a 3.5 per cent rise
in sales to Y315.7bn. After-tax profits increased 4.1 per cent to Y12.1bn.
However, its balance on financial items deteriorated due to redemptions of
warrant bonds.
Kao's personal care and cosmetics division saw a 4 per cent rise in sales to
Y114bn due to strong demand for new products. Sales of detergents rose 2.7
per cent to Y123.9bn, while hygiene products increased by 5.9 per cent to
Y37.8bn. Sales of chemicals and floppy disks rose 4.2 per cent to Y27.6bn.

FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: Secrets of cultivating Dollars
5bn in sales - Victor Mallet charts the growth of Thai group Charoen
Pokphand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUARDED by a team of security men on the 30th floor of his headquarters in
central Bangkok, Mr Dhanin Chearavanont is overseeing the rapid expansion of
Charoen Pokphand, the secretive multinational conglomerate that is already
Thailand's largest business group.
According to its own, deliberately vague estimates, CP now embraces more
than 200 companies, compared with 80 in 1979. Meanwhile, the number of
employees has risen from 15,000 to between 50,000 and 70,000.
Sales have risen tenfold to reach about Dollars 5bn in 1992, double the
turnover of the state-owned Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand,
the largest Thai company in Asiaweek magazine's annual list of the 1,000
biggest Asian companies.
The CP group does not figure on the list because it has no parent company  -
for tax reasons, according to Mr Dhanin  - and only a fraction of its
Dollars 5bn of sales appears in the accounts of publicly-listed companies
such as CP Feedmill in Bangkok and CP Pokphand in Hong Kong. The rest is
attributable to the Dhanin family's private interests. The group's debt and
profit figures are closely-guarded secrets.
Much of the expansion has come from CP's core agribusiness, especially in
China. 'We are confident that in five years we will be the first in
agribusiness worldwide,' said the 54-year-old Mr Dhanin.
His father and uncle migrated to Thailand from China in the 1920s and set up
a vegetable seed store in Bangkok. The group has diversified and grown to
become the largest supplier of animal feed in Asia, and the fourth largest
in the world, with 50 feedmills in nine countries and more than 100
poultry-breeding farms.
With its animal-breeding, feedmill and retail interests, CP pursues a policy
of vertical integration in its agricultural businesses  - 'from the farmyard
to the dinner table it's Charoen Pokphand all the way' is the slogan  - and
stockbrokers tend to be wary of CP's listed companies because they cannot
unscramble the relationships between the public and private sides of the
group.
Mr Dhanin, however, does not restrict himself to chickens, prawns and pigs.
The group already has a petrochemicals division and joint ventures in China
brewing Heineken beer and making motorcycles with Honda technology. In
Thailand, it has franchises for Makro, the Dutch wholesaler, and 7-Eleven
convenience stores.
Earlier this year, CP launched a petroleum business group to refine and
market fuels and open petrol stations in China, Thailand and IndoChina.
TelecomAsia, another CP company, has meanwhile raised Dollars 1.9bn to
finance the installation of 2m new telephone lines in Bangkok with the help
of Nynex of the US.
CP is expanding geographically, too. The company says it is investing in the
Ukraine and looking at Russia, Kazakhstan and Burma.
In sectors where it has no obvious previous experience or technological
skill  - such as telecommunications and petrochemicals  - CP's biggest
advantage is its political clout, especially in countries such as China,
Indonesia and Thailand, where ethnic Chinese businessmen like Mr Dhanin
predominate.
Such influence can be controversial. Mr Anand Panyarachun, a previous Thai
prime minister, accused government officials in charge of Thailand's
telephone line expansion project of corruption after they awarded the job of
3m new lines to CP. He farmed out 1m lines to another consortium, leaving CP
with the 2m they are presently installing.
Mr Dhanin says he takes a hands-off approach to CP's various projects and
simply hires the best people to do the work. However he rejects the
suggestion he is merely a middleman who receives a percentage for directing
foreign technology into difficult markets.
'CP is a project manager and not a middleman,' he said. 'We are also an
investor. As a project manager you have to seek people or companies with the
right technology.
'Many people harbour the misunderstanding that we have a lot of influence
over high-ranking officials. If that was so, Thailand's frequent changes of
government would have put us in deep trouble. It's just that we choose the
projects that answer people's needs.'
In spite of CP's wide geographic spread (it has subsidiaries in the US,
Portugal, the Netherlands and Turkey as well as in Asia), the key to the
group's future lies in China, where Mr Dhanin has plans for everything from
satellite launching to power stations and property developments.
Unlike some investors in China from the ethnic Chinese communities of
south-east Asia, Mr Dhanin's group of companies, with feedmills at the
forefront, has penetrated far beyond the booming southern provinces into
China's heartland.
'Investment in China is our biggest target,' he said. 'Our formula for
investing in developing countries is to try to be the first.'
Quoting an Asian proverb about risk and opportunity, he said: 'It is said
that if you don't go into the tiger's cave, you won't get a tiger cub.'

FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: Fletcher Challenge floats farm
business

<TEXT>
FLETCHER Challenge, the New Zealand energy and forestry concern, is to
publicly float the oldest part of its business, Wrightson, the farm supply
company founded in 1860.
Fletcher Challenge was formed from the merger in 1980 of Challenge
Corporation, whose main asset was Wrightson, and the building company
Fletcher Holdings. Yesterday's announcement surprised New Zealand investors,
as the farm servicing sector was always seen as a traditional and
fundamental part of the business.
Fletcher Challenge's chief executive, Mr Hugh Fletcher, said Wrightson was
an important part of the company's history. However, with its international
growth, the parent now used only a small proportion of the company's funds.
Its establishment as a separate entity would leave Wrightson to focus on the
rural sector.
Wrightson operates in such areas as woolbroking and rural real estate sales.
Revenue for 1992-93 was more than NZDollars 620m (USDollars 344.4m),
excluding commission sales of NZDollars 1.65bn.
Mr Fletcher said the sale was not driven by Fletcher Challenge's balance
sheet reduction programme, although the proceeds would be used to retire
debt.
The Wrightson shares will not be made available to shareholders living in
the US and Canada because of regulatory matters.
Mr Fletcher said that following the sale, Fletcher Challenge would
concentrate on its three core businesses: energy, forestry and construction.
The float will be through a pro rata entitlement to existing shareholders.
They will be offered the chance to subscribe for Wrightson shares at
NZDollars 100 for every 800 Fletcher Challenge shares held.
Fletcher Challenge also confirmed yesterday it would proceed with a
flotation of its New Zealand retail outlets.

FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: Anglovaal subsidiary in R393m
rights issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TARGET Exploration, a subsidiary of the Anglovaal group, has announced
details of a R393m (Dollars 117.3m) rights issue. The proceeds will go
towards the preparation of an area which may be developed as a R1.5bn gold
mine.
The rights issue follows an initial exploration effort which has produced
encouraging results.
It comes in the wake of a firmer trend in the gold price in recent months
which has prompted South Africa's mining houses to re-examine some of their
potential mines.
If Target's next phase of development confirms the promise of early
exploration work, it may open a 135,000-tonne-per-month mine, costing R1.5bn
with a life of over 20 years and a recovered ore grade of 11.58-8.85 grams
per tonne.
Target's lease area is in the Bothaville gap, an area of the Orange Free
State between the existing Welkom and Klerksdorp goldfields.
Target's main shareholders, Anglovaal and Anglo American, are both
supporting the issue. They will provide R310m. The balance of R83m will be
underwritten by Anglovaal.
After the rights issue, Anglovaal's shareholding will fall to 48 per cent
from 56 per cent , while Anglo American's will rise to 30 per cent from 17
per cent.
Loraine gold mine, which holds 17 per cent of Target, will not be following
its rights. These will be designated, at cost, to its shareholders.

<TEXT>
THE depressing impact of a strong dollar on international sales was
reflected yesterday in the third-quarter results of Schering-Plough and
American Cyanamid, two US pharmaceutical companies.
Schering-Plough posted a 17 per cent rise in net income to Dollars 199.4m,
or Dollars 1.03 a share from Dollars 174.5m, or 88 cents a year earlier.
Sales rose 4 per cent to Dollars 1.06bn. The company said sales would have
risen by 8 per cent excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange.
American Cyanamid blamed the strength of the dollar against major European
currencies for the 4 per cent fall in third-quarter sales from continuing
operations to Dollars 899m.
Earnings from continuing operations declined to Dollars 50m, or 55 cents
from Dollars 53m, or 59 cents in the same period of 1992.
Cyanamid recently announced a restructuring including 4,000 job losses.
The company reported the results of Cytec Industry, its chemicals business
which is to be spun-off, as a discontinued operation. Cyanamid is also
taking an after-tax charge of Dollars 100m for remediation expense related
to the chemicals business.
Including these charges, Cyanamid had a net loss of Dollars 363m, or Dollars
4.04 against net earnings of Dollars 61m, or 68 cents the previous year.
Sales and operating earnings from Cyanamid's medical group fell during the
quarter.

Allstate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A respite from big catastrophe losses during the third quarter enabled
Allstate, one of the US's biggest insurers, to report a sharp improvement in
post-tax profits for the period.
Allstate's net income reached Dollars 325.7m, or 72 cents a share, compared
with a loss of Dollars 485.8m, or Dollars 1.96 a share, a year ago.
Catastrophe-related losses, which reached Dollars 1.9bn in the third quarter
of 1992 due to claims in the US arising from Hurricane Andrew, amounted to
only Dollars 47m in the latest period.
The lack of any big US hurricane-related claims this year - the hurricane
season officially ended last week - is likely to have buoyed the profits of
other big property/casualty insurers, which are due to report shortly.
Net income at American General, the biggest door-to-door seller of life
insurance in the US, fell to Dollars 118.7m from Dollars 138m the year
before. This was due to a one-off Dollars 30m charge prompted by the rise in
the US corporate tax rate.
Before tax, the company reported record earnings of Dollars 233m, compared
with Dollars 206m in the third quarter of 1992. The figures reflected solid
earnings gains in consumer finance and retirement annuities, but a decline
in profits from the door-to-door insurance business.
An agreement to settle outstanding asbestos-related claims, reached in
August, led to a Dollars 130.6m third-quarter loss at Chubb, compared with a
Dollars 146.1m after-tax profit a year before.
Excluding the Dollars 357.5m charge, which Chubb had announced previously,
the company made an underwriting profit on property/casualty business of
Dollars 17.1m, compared with a Dollars 10.3m loss the previous year.

ITT, the US conglomerate, more than doubled third-quarter net income to
Dollars 252m, or Dollars 1.91 a share, from Dollars 113m, or 80 cents,last
year, on sales down from Dollars 5.5bn to Dollars 5.2bn.
But last year's third quarter was distorted by an after-tax gain of Dollars
622m on the sale of a stake in Alcatel; an after-tax charge of Dollars 759m
for insurance losses and Dollars 95m in hurricane insurance losses.
The latest period included an after-tax restructuring charge of Dollars 20m

FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: Earnings at Caterpillar surge
ahead to Dollars 96m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CATERPILLAR, the US heavy equipment and machinery manufacturer, said
third-quarter earnings, excluding a Dollars 495m tax windfall, jumped to
Dollars 96m, or 95 cents a share, from last year's Dollars 5m, or 5 cents.
The improvement follows an 18 per cent increase in sales in the US, and a 6
per cent rise in worldwide sales. Sales for the quarter were Dollars 2.8bn,
against Dollars 2.7bn a year ago.
The company said sales of agricultural, road construction, and home building
equipment in the US strengthened, but sales in Europe declined. Caterpillar
expects demand in Europe and Japan to improve during 1994.
Higher US industry demand continued to reflect increased replacement buying
because of low interest rates, growth in corporate cash flow, and generally
improving levels of economic activity. The recovery has lifted Caterpillar's
sales in the US to 50 per cent of company sales, from 45 per cent last year.
For the nine months net income was Dollars 533m, or Dollars 5.27, on sales
of Dollars 8.4bn, compared with a loss of Dollars 216m, or Dollars 2.14,
excluding extraordinary charges, on sales of Dollars 7.4bn in the same
period last year.

<TEXT>
COLGATE-Palmolive, the US consumer products group, is buying the liquid hand
and body soap brands of SC Johnson Wax, the privately-held US cleaning
products group, in a deal that would make it world market leader in liquid
soap.
The company also announced an 11 per cent increase in net income to Dollars
142.8m in the third quarter in spite of sluggish sales in North America and
Europe.
Colgate-Palmolive is market leader in liquid soap in the US, while Johnson
Wax is market leader in Europe and the Pacific with its Tahiti, Douss Douss,
Pouss' Mousse and Soft Wash brands.
Colgate-Palmolive said the brands it was buying had annual sales of Dollars
75m in the fast-growing market for liquid soap, a relatively recent product
innovation. It would not disclose the price of the deal but said it was not
material.
Although Colgate-Palmolive has a strong global position in consumer
products, many of its markets in the developed world are mature and it has
been looking for new areas of growth.
Worldwide sales fell to Dollars 1.82bn from Dollars 1.84bn in last year's
third quarter, but the company said they would have been 8 per cent higher
without adverse shifts in exchange rates.
Earnings per share rose 14 per cent to 89 cents.

STRONG growth in sales of the Sensor range of shaving products helped
produce record third-quarter income of Dollars 142m for Gillette, the US
shaving and consumer products group. This was a 13 per cent increase on the
same period last year, writes Richard Tomkins in New York.
Turnover for the quarter rose by 7 per cent to Dollars 1.34bn and net income
per common share rose 12 per cent to 65 cents.
Mr Alfred Zeien, chairman and chief executive, said the results had come in
spite of persistent economic sluggishness and the adverse effect of shifts
in exchange rates with European currencies.
Profits from blade and razor products were higher than in the comparable
quarter, the company said. Toiletries and cosmetics profits were modestly
ahead, while profits on stationery products were sharply higher following
the first-time inclusion of Parker Pen's results. In contrast, tough
competition sent Oral-B profits sharply lower.
Net income for the nine months to date was 12 per cent up at Dollars 422m
before the effect of accounting changes.

<TEXT>
AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph (AT&amp;T) and MCI Communications, the two
leading US long-distance telecommunications companies, yesterday reported
double-digit growth in third-quarter earnings.
AT&amp;T reported net income up 11.4 per cent to Dollars 1.073bn, or 79 cents a
share, compared with Dollars 963m, or 72 cents, in the same period of last
year. Revenue rose 3 per cent to Dollars 16.66bn.
MCI reported earnings of Dollars 174m, or 30 cents a share, against Dollars
154m, or 29 cents, in the same period of last year. Excluding a one-time
charge of Dollars 18m because of tax law changes, earnings per share rose by
nearly 14 per cent.
Both sets of figures were broadly in line with market expectations.
AT&amp;T said revenues from the long-distance market, where it is fighting to
maintain its 60 per cent market share, were little changed on a year ago, as
customers switched to lower priced services.
Calling volumes were up 5.5 per cent from a year earlier and long-distance
profitability continued to be strong, showing a 2 percentage point increase
in gross margins to 38.8 per cent.
The company's revenue growth was helped by an 8 per cent increase in sales
of telecommunications products to Dollars 317m, with strong growth outside
the US.
However, NCR, the computer company acquired by AT&amp;T two years ago, which has
been undergoing a senior management shake-up, continued to report poor
results. Sales of products and systems rose 4 per cent, but it had an
operating loss of Dollars 49m, attributed to competitive pricing,
particularly for personal computers, and a Dollars 23m restructuring charge.
MCI reported 14.7 per cent growth in traffic, well above the industry
average, which it attributed to a raft of innovative long-distance services
for business and consumer markets.
It added that a global joint venture with British Telecom, which agreed
earlier this year to take a large stake in MCI, was moving ahead, though it
still requires regulatory and shareholder approval.
For the nine months, AT&amp;T reported net income of Dollars 3.1bn, or Dollars
2.30, on revenues of Dollars 48.7bn, excluding accounting changes, compared
with net income of Dollars 2.81bn, or Dollars 2.11 a share, on sales of
Dollars 47.4bn last year.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BZW Securities yesterday launched the first listed warrants that allow
investors to trade the spread between the German DAX stock index and the
French CAC40 Index. The DAX closed at 2048 and the CAC at 2199.7 yesterday,
bringing the spread to 151.7 points.
The gap was at 124 points when the warrants were issued, but widened after
the Bundesbank cut its key rates by  1/2 point. The move is expected to
spark near-term French rate cuts, and so spur the French stock market.
In recent weeks, the DAX has outperformed the CAC, causing the spread
between the two indices to narrow, close to its 96-point low for the last
two years. The warrants are aimed at investors who expect the French index
to outperform its German counterpart and expect the spread to widen rapidly
to over 200 points.
The warrants, which expire on December 21, were issued at DM60 and closed at
DM70 bid. One warrant entitles the holder to receive an amount in D-Marks
equivalent to the difference, if positive, between the spread of CAC40 over
the DAX and the strike of 144.

THE CDollars 50bn Desjardins financial services group has fixed a price of
CDollars 11.57 a share or a total of about CDollars 625m (USDollars 466m) to
complete the takeover of rival Laurentian Group.
All Desjardins' financial services units, except its 1,300 credit union
branches, mainly in Quebec, will be merged with the smaller Laurentian into
Desjardins-Laurentian Financial, a holding company minority-held by the
public.
This holding company, together with the credit unions, will have corporate
assets and assets under management of almost CDollars 80bn, placing it among
Canada's top five financial services groups. It will also include Laurentian
Bank.
The CDollars 11.57 per Laurentian share being paid by Desjardins will
comprise CDollars 6.22 cash plus stock or notes of the new holding company.
The full offer goes out November 1.
The biggest Laurentian unit, Toronto-based Imperial Life Assurance, with
half its business in the US, now becomes part of Desjardins.
Groupe Victoire of France, a minority holder of Laurentian, will retain a
smaller interest in the merged group, taking cash and stock in the holding
company.
The merger is expected to close in January and the new holding company's
stock will be quoted on the Canadian stock exchanges.

CANADIAN Pacific Forest Products, one of North America's biggest newsprint
producers, reduced operating losses sharply in the first nine months. It was
helped by firmer prices for some products, greater efficiency and a lower
Canadian dollar, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
Operating loss was CDollars 91.3m (USDollars 68.9m) against CDollars 153.4m,
and the final loss after special items was CDollars 125m, or CDollars 2.16 a
share, against a loss of CDollars 188.4m, or CDollars 3.20, a year earlier.
Sales were little changed at CDollars 1.4bn.
The third-quarter final loss was CDollars 12.3m, or 20 cents a share,
compared with a profit of CDollars 57.9m, or CDollars 1.10, last time.

A LOWER effective tax rate led to a 9.7 per cent advance in net income at
Johnson &amp; Johnson during the third quarter, the US healthcare products group
announced yesterday, writes Richard Waters.
Pre-tax earnings climbed by only 2.5 per cent, but after-tax profits jumped
from Dollars 414m, or 63 cents a share, to Dollars 454m, or 70 cents.
The strong US dollar restricted sales growth to less than 1 per cent in
dollar terms. Sales climbed by 7.1 per cent in local currency terms, but
after translation into the US currency rose only to Dollars 3.51bn, from
Dollars 3.48bn a year before.

FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company: Shake-up drives WMX to Dollars 127m
loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WMX Technologies, the waste management and environmental group, posted a
loss of Dollars 127m, or 26 cents a share, in the third quarter, largely
because of costs related to restructuring at its hazardous waste subsidiary,
Chemical Waste Management, writes Laurie Morse.
The loss compares with a Dollars 216m, or 44 cents, profit in the third
quarter of 1992.
Chemical Waste, 80 per cent owned by WMX, reported a Dollars 359.9m net loss
for the quarter after a Dollars 363m after-tax charge for writing down
assets and restructuring.
Chemical Waste's operations have been plagued by declining off-site
hazardous waste volumes and overcapacity in the US hazardous waste
incineration business.
For the nine months, WMX had income of Dollars 289m, or 60 cents, 7bn, down
from Dollars 667m, or Dollars 1.35, in the first nine months of 1992.

FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company: Cigarette wars hit American Brands'
income

<TEXT>
AMERICAN Brands, the US tobacco and consumer goods group, has emerged as
another victim of the cigarette price war as it reported a slump in
third-quarter net income to Dollars 85m from Dollars 202.7m in the same
period last year, writes Richard Tomkins.
Price cutting in the domestic market led its American Tobacco subsidiary to
turn in an operating loss of Dollars 35m for the quarter, including
exceptional charges of Dollars 60m for writedowns of stock values and
restructuring, the company said.
Exchange rate movements on overseas earnings, particularly sterling, wiped
Dollars 52m off net income.
Third-quarter turnover fell to Dollars 3.3bn from Dollars 3.77bn, but the
company said the figure would have been 1 per cent higher without the impact
of exchange rate movements. Net income per share fell to 42 cents from 95
cents.
Net income for the nine months to September was Dollars 282.4m, against
Dollars 650.5m.

<TEXT>
MICROSOFT, the leading personal computer software company, reported a 20 per
cent increase in first-quarter revenues.
Net income for the quarter was in line with expectations at Dollars 239m or
79 cents a share, up from Dollars 209m or 70 cents in the same period last
year.
Revenues rose to Dollars 983m from Dollars 818m a year ago. Those from
software sold to computer manufacturers were particularly strong,
representing 26 per cent of the total, said Mr Mike Brown, Microsoft's
vice-president of finance and treasurer. For fiscal 1993, these OEM sales
represented 19 per cent of total revenues.
In the first quarter, sales of operating systems software accounted for 36
per cent of revenues, up from 32 per cent in the same period last year.
Applications programs sales were 59 per cent of revenues, down from 60 per
cent.
Microsoft said changing software buying patterns have lifted sales of its
suite of office software products.
Whereas individual stand-alone applications products once generated the bulk
of applications unit sales, the Microsoft Office, combining word processing,
spreadsheet, presentation graphics, database management and electronic mail
is its most popular applications product.
More than 2.5m units have shipped worldwide.
Earlier, Microsoft executives had warned analysts that the increase in sales
of suites of programs, together with the rise in OEM sales was expected to
slow revenue growth in the future.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 1993, Microsoft's revenues rose 27 per cent,
while net profits were up 20 per cent.
During the quarter, Microsoft began shipping its most-advanced operating
system product, Microsoft Windows NT.

FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: Restructuring boosts Sears
Roebuck in third quarter
</HEADLINE>

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SEARS, Roebuck, the US retail and insurance group, recorded the second most
profitable third quarter in its history, as the restructuring and the
divestiture of several businesses boosted its bottom line.
This is the third consecutive quarterly earnings improvement, after a record
loss in 1992.
Sears reported consolidated net income of Dollars 388.4m, or 98 cents per
share, up from a consolidated net loss of Dollars 853.8m, or Dollars 2.30,
for the third quarter of 1992.
Last year's third-quarter loss was primarily due to after-tax charges of
Dollars 1.2bn related to insurance claims against Allstate in the aftermath
of Hurricane Andrew.
Income from continuing operations was Dollars 453.9m in the quarter,
compared with a loss of Dollars 992.3m in the same 1992 quarter.
Third-quarter results include a Dollars 81m favourable income tax
adjustment, which was partly offset by a Dollars 65.5m extraordinary charge
related to the company's call of a Dollars 300m, 7 per cent deep-discounted
bond.
Consolidated revenues in the quarter fell to Dollars 12.7bn, from Dollars
12.8bn a year ago, reflecting the divestiture of Sear's catalogue operation
and several merchandising operations.
Since spinning off the balance of its ownership in Dean Witter, Discover in
June, Sears' continuing operations include its merchandising group, 80 per
cent ownership of Allstate Insurance, and its property group, Homart
Development.
The merchandising group reported third-quarter income of Dollars 215.2m and
revenues of Dollars 7.3bn, compared with last year's loss of Dollars 49.4m
on sales of Dollars 7.7bn.
Allstate's income was Dollars 260.9m, against a loss of Dollars 845.8m, and
revenues improved to Dollars 6.3bn, from Dollars 5.07bn in the third quarter
last year.
Homart Development continued to show a loss, at Dollars 5m in the quarter,
compared with last year's loss of Dollars 6.2m.
For the first nine months, Sears recorded consolidated net income of Dollars
1.8bn, or Dollars 4.73 per share, against a loss of Dollars 2.1bn, or
Dollars 5.84 for the first three quarters of 1992.
Sales for the nine-month period were only marginally lower, at Dollars
36.2bn, compared with Dollars 37.3bn a year ago.

AMR Corporation, parent company of American Airlines, one of the biggest US
airlines, turned in a second consecutive quarter of profit.
Net income was Dollars 118m for the third quarter, compared with net losses
of Dollars 100m last time.
Mr Robert Crandall, chairman, said the profits were 'insufficient, but a
step in the right direction'.
'While we remain far short of our goals, we are pleased that our continuing
efforts to control costs and maximise revenue have begun to improve
results,' he said.
The company dismissed reports that it was seeking an alliance with Sabena,
the Belgian national carrier. American Airlines is the only large US airline
not to have secured a large alliance with a European partner.
American Airlines, like others in the US industry, has been dogged by tough
competition from lower-cost operators offering cheaper fares. Last month it
announced plans to eliminate 5,000 jobs and ground 11 of its DC-10 aircraft.
Net earnings for the first nine months are Dollars 143m, compared with a
loss of Dollars 275m.

operating advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOBIL, the big US energy group, outstripped market expectations yesterday by
unveiling a 40 per cent jump in underlying third-quarter earnings,
reflecting increased oil production and higher sales of petroleum products.
Net income for the quarter was Dollars 666m, or Dollars 1.63 a share,
compared with Dollars 413m, or Dollars 1, a year earlier.
Excluding one-time net gains of Dollars 53m in the latest quarter and a
special charge of Dollars 25m a year earlier, Mobil said operating earnings
rose 40 per cent to Dollars 613m, or Dollars 1.50.
Mobil's US marketing and refining operations earned Dollars 139m in the
quarter, compared with a loss of Dollars 19m a year earlier. The company
attributed the improvement partly to better industry margins.
Overseas, marketing and refining brought in earnings of Dollars 215m, up
Dollars 130m, led by a strong performance in the Pacific Rim.
Results in Europe were better than last year, but continued to reflect the
impact of recession.
Cost-cutting measures also helped earnings.
Mobil's domestic exploration and producing earnings fell Dollars 36m to
Dollars 110m. A sharp drop in crude oil prices was only partly offset by
higher natural gas prices and lower administrative expenses.
International exploration and producing earnings dropped Dollars 61m to
Dollars 255m reflecting lower crude oil and natural gas prices and reduced
European natural gas volumes.
Earnings from chemicals slid Dollars 15m to Dollars 9m. The company blamed
sluggish economies and industry oversupply for the low margins on
polyethylene and films.
During the quarter, Mobil's corporate and other expenses rose Dollars 11m to
Dollars 47m but financing expenses were Dollars 10m lower at Dollars 68m,
reflecting a lower debt level and lower interest rates.
Amoco, the Chicago-based energy company, posted third-quarter net income of
Dollars 520m, or Dollars 1.05, against Dollars 496m, or Dollars 1 a year
ago. Stripping out one-time items in both years, Amoco's operating earnings
slipped to Dollars 446m, or 90 cents from Dollars 454m, or 92 cents last
year.
Lower crude oil prices and production volume depressed earnings from US
exploration and production, to Dollars 156m from Dollars 253m last time.
Outside of the US, exploration and production earned Dollars 62m, including
a one-time gain of Dollars 70m, compared with Dollars 107m a year earlier,
including tax benefits of Dollars 23m.
Refining, marketing and transportation earned Dollars 225m in the quarter,
compared with Dollars 143m.

FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: Apple margins under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
APPLE Computer's profit margins are expected to continue to decline,
following the launch yesterday of several aggressively-priced Macintosh
products.
Apple is aiming to lift its share of the personal computer market in the
face of intense price competition.
The new Macintosh PCs include desktop models aimed at business and education
customers as well as consumers, and two portable notebook computers. Prices
are 20 per cent to 35 per cent lower than existing models and in some
instances less expensive than equivalent IBM-compatible products. This
represents the sixth round of price cuts by Apple since April.
'We used to have a higher priced, lower volume business model, but people
are no longer willing to pay a premium for our technology leadership, so we
have had to shift to a lower price, higher volume strategy,' said Mr Ian
Diery, executive vice-president.
Apple's gross profit margins have fallen over the past year from more than
40 per cent to less than 26 per cent. With further price cuts, profit
margins would continue to decline in the current quarter, the company said.
In the latest fourth quarter, net profits dropped 97 per cent to just
Dollars 2.7m.
Apple's inventories rose sharply in the fourth quarter. Mr Diery said the
increase, from Dollars 580m in the same quarter last year, to more than
Dollars 1.5bn, was partly explained by a build-up of stocks of the new
products announced yesterday.
In an effort to avoid product shortages that limited Apple's ability to take
advantage of strong demand in the fourth quarter, he said they had
accumulated two to three times as many of the new products as it did before
prior product launches.
However, Apple's bloated inventory included a 'significant' quantity of
older products, he admitted. If the discounts did not increase sales, Apple
may be forced to take a write-off, analysts said.

SHARES in Dow Chemical tumbled Dollars 3 1/8 in heavy trading yesterday
morning in spite of on-target third-quarter earnings from the US chemicals
group, before closing at Dollars 56 3/8 for a net fall of Dollars 2 1/2 .
Analysts were at a loss to explain the stock's movement, given the 9 per
cent decline in Dow's third-quarter net income to Dollars 139m, or 50 cents
a share, was what most analysts had predicted.
A year earlier, Dow posted net income of Dollars 153m, or 55 cents. Sales in
the 1993 quarter fell 8 per cent to Dollars 4.37bn from Dollars 4.75bn. Mr
Leonard Bogner, senior chemical analysts at Prudential Securities, said some
investors were concerned by the company's large loss in Europe.
He blamed Dow's poor European performance on seasonal factors and foreign
exchanges losses rather than a downward spiral in business. 'Since the end
of the third quarter, volumes have picked up and prices in Europe have
improved,' he said.
Mr Bogner cut his full-year estimates to Dollars 2.30 a share from Dollars
2.38, but maintained his 1994 estimates at Dollars 3.50.
Mr Jeff Cianci, analyst at Bear, Stearns noted Europe was particularly weak
in the quarter, but left his 1993 earnings projections of Dollars 2.24
unchanged.
During the quarter, sales for chemicals and performance products dropped 11
per cent to Dollars 1bn while operating income plunged 31 per cent to
Dollars 76m.
Dow blamed falling prices for caustic soda and magnesium for the poor
performance of its chemicals and metals operations. It said performance
products had higher profits in spite of lower sales in Europe.
Sales of plastics fell 8 per cent to Dollars 1.6bn, but operating income
grew 41 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 110m, led by Dow's thermosets and
fabricated products businesses in the US.
Sales of hydrocarbons and energy rose 6 per cent to Dollars 453m. The sector
had operating income of Dollars 12m, compared with an operating loss of
Dollars 8m.
Sales of Dow's consumer specialties group fell 10 per cent to Dollars 1.3bn
and operating income dropped 27 per cent to Dollars 166m.
Mr Enrique Falla, executive vice-president, said Dow saved more than Dollars
200m in research, promotion, selling and administrative expenses and
interest charges compared with 1992.

AFTER-tax profits at Bankers Trust soared to Dollars 310m in the third
quarter, nearly 25 per cent higher than the previous three months. The sharp
rise was the result of continued volatility in international financial
markets and the bank's strong position in the derivatives business.
Earnings per share, at Dollars 3.71, exceeded market expectations and
compared with Dollars 2.97 a share in the second quarter, when it earned
Dollars 251m after tax, and Dollars 1.90 a share against Dollars 166m after
tax a year ago.
Trading revenue jumped by Dollars 187m, or 77 per cent, from Dollars 431m.
The majority of this growth resulted from risk-management products sold to
clients rather than proprietary trading, said Mr Charles Sanford, chairman.
Trading-related profits were also behind the reported Dollars 52m increase
in the bank's net interest income, which rose to Dollars 364m for the
quarter.
Most other operations also recorded solid gains. Income from fund management
and custody services rose by Dollars 35m to Dollars 183m, while fee and
commission income was up Dollars 33m to Dollars 198m.
Higher bonuses stemming from the record results meant that Bankers Trust
paid out twice as much under incentive schemes and other benefit
arrangements during the period than it paid in normal salaries.
Bonuses and other benefits paid to staff jumped to Dollars 326m, from
Dollars 183m the year before. Normal salary payments rose only 8 per cent,
to Dollars 176m, suggesting the bank's cost base remained flexible and would
shrink in the event of falling trading income.
Bankers Trust's trading results have remained more consistent during
volatile market conditions than those of rivals such as Salomon Brothers,
which depend more heavily on own-account trading to generate their profits.
The bank's return on equity reached 30 per cent during the quarter at an
annualised rate, up from 26 per cent in the previous three months.
Salomon, by contrast, made a spectacular 40 per cent (on a fully diluted
basis) in the second quarter before plunging to 0.1 per cent in the latest
three months.

FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: Prudential Securities in Dollars
371m settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRUDENTIAL Securities is to pay Dollars 371m in a settlement connected with
high-risk real estate and energy investments it sold during the 1980s.
It is the second-biggest financial settlement enforced by US securities
regulators.
The payout results from an agreement hammered out between the Prudential
Insurance subsidiary, the Securities and Exchange Commission, securities
regulators in 49 US states and the National Association of Securities
Dealers.
The securities firm was involved in 'massive misconduct' in the sale of
investments in more than 700 so-called limited partnerships between 1980 and
1990, the regulatory bodies said.
The partnerships  - vehicles set up to allow groups of individuals to pool
investments in property and energy ventures  - were in many cases sold as
low-risk investments, when in fact they involved large risks.
Some Dollars 330m of the settlement will be paid into a fund for investors
who lost money, while the rest will be distributed in fines to the
securities regulators involved.
Any of the 320,000 limited partnership investors who believe they were
misled by Prudential will have to file a claim before they can receive
compensation.
The settlement exceeds the Dollars 290m paid by Salomon Brothers after the
Treasury bond auction scandal, but is less than the Dollars 650m levied on
Drexel Burnham Lambert.
The bulk of these settlements were in the form of fines, rather than
compensation payments to investors. Prudential has paid out Dollars 260m to
groups of investors to settle claims arising from losses on limited
partnerships.
Texas is the only US state which did not participate in yesterday's deal.
It is pursuing a separate settlement over the sale of substantial property
investments in the Dallas/Fort Worth area.

RHONE-Poulenc Rorer, the majority-owned pharmaceuticals subsidiary of the
French group Rhone-Poulenc, yesterday reported third-quarter earnings down
21 per cent to Dollars 102.7m from Dollars 130.5m. The results were affected
by a slowdown in underlying sales and exchange rates.
RPR is important for Rhone-Poulenc which is being privatised. Analysts
expect the French group's healthcare business to contribute nearly 90 per
cent of its operating profits this year.
RPR's turnover fell 8 per cent to Dollars 960m from Dollars 1.05bn. The
company said the US dollar was 17 per cent stronger against the French franc
during the third quarter last year. About 25 per cent of the subsidiary's
sales are in France.
Excluding currencies, sales were up 3 per cent compared with the same period
last year. Higher turnover in France was offset by a fall in sales in
Germany and Italy, following healthcare reforms.
Gross margins improved nearly 1 per cent on the third quarter last year
thanks to reduced operating expenses and a reduction in interest charges.
Net interest charges fell to Dollars 10.1m from Dollars 29.3m.
Earnings per share fell to 51 cents from 66 cents for the same quarter last
year.
Without exceptional items in 1992 and this year, earnings per share for both
third quarters would have been 62 cents.

A 5 per cent increase in shipments helped further strong profits growth for
Coca-Cola, the US soft drinks group, in the third quarter. However, changes
in the tax regime reduced the impact on the bottom line.
Net income would have been 15 per cent ahead at Dollars 623m, but the
effects of unusual items  - mainly tax changes  - left the figure 9 per cent
ahead at Dollars 590m.
Mr Robert Goizueta, chairman and chief executive, said the company was
pleased to have achieved the results in the face of weak economic conditions
worldwide.
Mr Goizueta forecast earnings-per-share growth of 19 per cent to 20 per cent
for the full year, excluding non-recurring items.
Earnings per share in the latest quarter were up 17 per cent at 48 cents
excluding unusual items. After items, they were 10 per cent ahead at 45
cents. In the nine months to date, net income grew 18 per cent to Dollars
1.8bn excluding unusual items and 15 per cent to Dollars 1.7bn including
them.
Coca-Cola said the 5 per cent increase in North American volume was driven
by gains in the sales of core brands and new products, such as PowerAde and
Nestea.
European sales growth was hindered by weak economic conditions and poor
weather. Japanese volumes fell after a wet summer, but these factors were
offset by faster growth in other regions.

FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: Apple launch will not ease
profit pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
APPLE Computer's profit margins are expected to continue to decline,
following the launch yesterday of several aggressively-priced Macintosh
products.
Apple is aiming to lift its share of the personal computer market in the
face of intense price competition.
The new Macintosh PCs include desktop models aimed at business and education
customers as well as consumers, and two portable notebook computers.
Prices are 20 per cent to 35 per cent lower than existing models and in some
instances less expensive than equivalent IBM-compatible products.
This represents the sixth round of price cuts by Apple since April.
'Over the past five or six months we have dramatically changed our strategy.
We used to have a higher priced, lower volume business model, but people are
no longer willing to pay a premium for our technology leadership, so we have
had to shift to a lower price, higher volume strategy,' said Mr Ian Diery,
executive vice-president.
'We have proved the price elasticity of the Macintosh market,' Mr Diery
claimed.
'In its recently completed fourth quarter, Apple reported a 21 per cent
increase in revenues and a 30 per cent increase in unit shipments,' he
pointed out.
However, Apple's gross profit margins have plummeted over the past year from
over 40 per cent to less than 26 per cent.
With further price cuts, profit margins would continue to decline in the
current quarter, the company said. In the latest fourth quarter net profits
dropped 97 per cent to just Dollars 2.7m.
Apple's inventories rose sharply in the fourth quarter, Mr Diery
acknowledged. He said the increase, from Dollars 580m in the same quarter
last year, to over Dollars 1.5bn, was partly explained by a build-up of
stocks of the new products announced yesterday.
In an effort to avoid product shortages that limited Apple's ability to take
advantage of strong demand in the fourth quarter, he said they had
accumulated two to three times as many of the new products as it did before
prior product launches.
However, Apple's bloated inventory included, a 'significant' quantity of
older products, he admitted.
The company has high stocks of notebook computers that it would try to sell
at a heavy discount over the next few months, putting further pressure on
profit margins.
If the discounts did not increase sales, Apple may be forced to take a
write-off, analysts said.

FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: Norwegian shipowner up sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEIF HOEGH, one of Norway's biggest shipowners, reported a sharp increase in
nine month pre-tax profit to NKr581m (Dollars 81m) from NKr135m last year,
helped by a stronger fleet, higher freight rates and a stronger dollar.
Group net freight revenue rose to NKr1.79bn from NKr1.58bn as operating
profit increased to NKr274m from NKr218m. The shipowner posted a nine-month
financial profit of NKr48m against a financial loss of NKr83m during last
year's comparative interim.
Hoegh said the improvement was due to a rise in net interest income to
NKr64m from NKr58m, a decline in foreign currency losses to NKr24m from
NKr38m and a drop in interest expenses to NKr57m from NKr77m.
The group also achieved financial gains of NKr66m on investments, against a
loss of NKr26m last year. Hoegh said the oil products market from North
Africa to the US and Europe for combination carriers was quite good
throughout the third quarter but that it had weakened for tankers with a
strong autumn market yet to materialise.
IM Skaugen, the Norwegian gas carrier group, reported a reduction in
nine-month pre-tax losses to NKr151m from NKr338m, helped by a fall in
financial and operating costs and a stronger dollar.
Last year the group also operated tankers which it has since divested, so
figures are not directly comparable. Group operating losses were cut
significantly to NKr75m from NKr236m from last year's comparative period.
Voyage costs in the nine-month period were reduced to NKr60m from NKr267m as
other operating costs were cut by more than half to NKr101m from NKr247m.

<TEXT>
BASF, one of Germany's leading chemicals companies, will make no profits
from its healthcare business this year, according to Mr Hans Uwe Schenck,
chairman of the group's Knoll drugs company.
Mr Schenck, who said Knoll was to cut its labour costs by 15 per cent, added
that his forecast excluded any charges incurred by workforce reductions. He
attributed two-thirds of the blame for the slump to the German government's
clamp on health service costs.
Knoll, which earned DM113m (Dollars 68m) net last year, will also seek
economies by reducing spending on research and development by around 10 per
cent, in contrast to the usual practice of increasing budgets by a similar
proportion.
Turnover in the nine months to the end of September had fallen 5 per cent to
DM1.48bn despite a 3 per cent increase in foreign sales which accounted for
77 per cent of the total.
Domestic turnover had dropped 7 per cent overall, although revenues from
drugs affected by a government-imposed price freeze and prescription limits
had fallen 14 per cent.
Mr Schenck protested that although drugs accounted for only 15 per cent of
the statutory health scheme's costs, manufacturers were having to bear 20
per cent of the cuts. Leading German research-based pharmaceuticals makers
had suffered falls in sales of between 9 per cent and 27 per cent in the
first eight months of the year, he said.
Mr Schenck also revealed that Knoll had stopped all research and development
work on a genetically-engineered cancer treatment, TNF, which which had not
proved 'significantly effective' in clinical trials.

<TEXT>
ARGENTARIA, Spain's partially privatised state banking corporation, said
yesterday the subscription period for a second share issue of up to 25 per
cent of its capital would commence on November 3.
The issue, which is likely to inject more than Dollars 1bn into the Spanish
treasury, follows a domestic and international flotation of 24.9 per cent of
Argentaria's capital last May.
Around 60 per cent of the Argentaria 2 shares will be offered on the
domestic market, with a weighting towards small retailers, and the rest will
be placed outside Spain among international institutions. The subscription
period will last seven days and the price will be dictated both by the share
trading during that week and by the book building process in which Morgan
Stanley of the US will act as global co-ordinator.
Argentaria's international road shows will commence next week in London and
the banking group will be seeking to fuel investor interest with impressive
results that, at the third quarter stage of this year, have put Argentaria
at the top of the domestic banking table in terms of net profit growth.
The group said its after-tax profits had totalled Pta61.3bn (Dollars 472m)
at the end of September, a 15 per cent rise on the first nine months of
1992, following a 29.9 per cent increase in its operating margin to
Pta104bn. Argentaria's share price increased by 43.7 per cent between May
12, when it began trading, and September 30 when the share price closed at
Pta5,460 to give the banking group a market capitalisation of Pta885.2bn.
Rival Spanish banks, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, and Banco Santander, respectively
reported third-quarter net profits yesterday of Pta62.4bn, and of Pta67.4bn.
The profits of both banks represented an increase of 8.7 per cent on those
on the first nine months of 1992.
Earlier, Banco Central Hispano reported virtually flat after-tax profits of
Pta45.4bn.

ANOTHER strong performance from its forest operations helped Repola,
Finland's largest industrial group, achieve profits of FM86m (Dollars 15.1m)
in the first eight months after sales grew 12 per cent to FM16.8bn.
The result compares with a FM415m loss in the same 1992 period and reflects
the benefits of the weaker Finnish markka and increased production at its
main unit, United Paper Mills (UPM).
Operating profits more than doubled to FM1.79bn from FM818m. However,
financing costs rose to FM1.7bn from FM1.23bn partly because foreign
exchange losses increased to FM408m from FM109m.
UPM saw sales rise 21 per cent to FM10.8bn and pre-tax profits increase to
FM725m from FM133m. The division benefited from streamlining, higher
magazine paper sales, a good paperboard market and increased sawn goods
exports.
Sales fell 3 per cent to FM5bn at Rauma, the group's metals and engineering
unit, although the division's pre-tax loss fell sharply to FM15m from
FM238m. Rosenlaw, the company's packaging unit, lifted sales by 7 per cent
to FM910m as it swung to a FM21 pre-tax profit from a FM27m loss last time
round.

even in quarter

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SALOMON Brothers, Wall Street's most volatile investment bank, was out of
favour with investors again yesterday after reporting that it had barely
broken even in the third quarter. This result followed a big trading loss in
the US.
The full scale of the loss was not disclosed, but it was large enough to
wipe out trading profits made in Japan and Europe and lead to an overall
pre-tax loss on proprietary (or own-account) trading of Dollars 173m.
The loss dragged down post-tax profits of Salomon Inc, the parent company,
to Dollars 20m, or one cent a share, during the period. In the previous
three months, it had recorded the highest-ever earnings of a Wall Street
firm, at Dollars 498m before one-off charges.
The news pushed Salomon's shares down Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 44 3/8 ,
though they later recovered and were trading at Dollars 45 1/8 by midday in
New York.
Salomon said only that the trading loss was 'incurred by the US arbitrage
unit in previously established long-term strategies'. The losses are not
believed to have come from direct bets on European interest rates, which has
been an active area for all investment banks in the past 18 months. However,
the unit is thought to have anticipated a quicker alignment of European and
American interest rates than has occurred.
Salomon refused to comment on persistent market rumours that it also lost
money in US mortgage-backed securities, which failed to match the rally in
US Treasury bonds during the summer.
The bank said the US trading loss arose from the need to revalue long-term
trading positions at the end of each quarter, and does not reflect the true
long-term results of the proprietary trading business.
During the previous three months it reported total income (net of interest
expenses) of Dollars 523m on own-account trading, after a Dollars 303m loss
in the first quarter of the year and revenues of Dollars 645m in the last
three months of 1992.
Pre-tax income from what the bank terms 'client-related activities'  -
commission income, investment banking fees and trading related to customers'
securities transactions  - reached Dollars 192m, the second-highest level
ever after the previous quarter.

GAN, the French state-controlled insurance group, yesterday announced a fall
in first-half net profits, to FFr372m (Dollars 64m) from FFr487m. However,
it forecast an improvement in full-year results compared with 1992.
Mr Francois Heilbronner, chairman, said the group was well-prepared for
privatisation. Gan, one of the 21 publicly-owned groups due to be sold by
the government, could be privatised next year.
The group, which suffered a sharp fall in profits in 1992  - to FFr402m from
FFr2.32bn  - because of substantial property provisions and depressed
insurance markets, said it was on the road to recovery.
Group turnover rose 8.6 per cent to FFr62.3bn. Insurance activities returned
FFr43.7bn, of which 26 per cent came from overseas activities.
The company said the fire and accident insurance businesses had shown a
healthy improvement over 1992, and that CIC, its banking subsidiary, had
lifted net profits from FF91m in the first half of 1992 to FFr235m this
time.
Mr Heilbronner's comments about the remainder of this year and the improved
outlook for 1994, suggest the French insurance market is beginning to
recover after a sharp decline in 1992.
Industry analysts said, however, that recovery was likely to be gradual.

Reiterating its prediction that it would make a profit for the year, the
Hanover-based group reported that sales dropped by 6 per cent in the first
nine months to DM6.8bn (Dollars 4.1bn). Sales to to the European auto
industry dropped by 26 per cent in the period.
Continental cautioned that the operating results for its mainstream tyre
business, as well as its non-tyre technical products, would be considerably
under last year's level, reflecting the depth of the recession in Europe as
well as weaknesses in the US market for replacement tyres.
However, Mr Hubertus von Grunberg, chief executive, said he was confident
that the group would be able to achieve its plan of sales of 5m winter tyres
in the coming months.

FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: US derivatives debate
intensifies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Wayne Angell, a US Federal Reserve Board governor, has intensified the
debate about the derivatives markets by declaring that he does not share the
concerns of some fellow board members about the futures markets.
'I consider derivatives simply a product of the free market system,' he said
in an interview with the Financial Times.
His views contrasts with those of other Fed board members  - notably
vice-chairman Mr David Mullins, who has said derivatives need to be more
carefully regulated  - and clash heavily with those of the Bundesbank, the
German central bank.
Mr Angell, who chairs the Basle committee on bank payment and settlement
systems, said worries over the risks derivatives pose to the banking system
could be alleviated by making global payment and settlement systems more
responsive to the needs of the 24-hour markets.
Derivatives, like other financial instruments, carry payment risks that
increase the longer the period is between a transaction and its settlement.
He said upgrades in the Fed wire system, which is used for payment transfers
between US banks, will allow the system to operate on a real-time basis 16
hours per day beginning in April at most depository institutions.
Mr Angell's comments contrast sharply with this week's warning from the
Bundesbank, the German central bank, that the growth of global derivatives
markets could endanger the stability of the world financial system.
The Bundesbank in its latest monthly report argued that the rapid increase
in the use of derivatives had led to an inter-linking of the world's
financial market and made them 'vulnerable to a crisis'.
According to the Bundesbank, the notional amount of futures traded globally
has reached Dollars 140,000bn annually while the notional outstanding swaps
(contracts entered directly between banks) total around Dollars 4,500bn.
The US spotlight on derivatives is likely to widen next week, when the
Commmodity Futures Trading Commission, the chief regulator of US futures
exchanges, delivers its Congressionally-mandated study on derivatives to
congress.
Congress ordered the report when it reauthorised the agency a year ago and
gave it new exemptive powers on over-the-counter derivatives.
Industry insiders say that the CFTC report is likely to be more descriptive
than critical.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
L'OREAL, the world's largest cosmetics group, achieved pre-tax profits of
FFr2.45bn (Dollars 422m) in the first half of the year, a 10.5 per cent
increase over the same period in 1992, writes John Ridding.
The company anticipates growth in profits for the full year will be at least
the same as in the first half. In 1992, the group reported pre-tax profits
of FFr4bn. The rise in first-half profits was achieved on a sales increase
of 7.1 per cent.

Multitone Electronics blamed delays in a distribution agreement taking full

Shares in the communication systems company fell 18p to 105p.
The market had been expecting profits of Pounds 1.7m for the year to April
30 1994. However, with the company predicting second half profits comparable
to the same period last year it is thought that there should be a small

A DEPRESSED market and increased competition made for a difficult year at
Air London International, the USM-quoted charter broker.
On turnover of Pounds 15.2m (Pounds 17.8m), pre-tax profits for the 12
months to July 31 fell from Pounds 1.09m to Pounds 726,000. Mr Tony Mack,
chairman, blamed a difficult UK market and a 40 per cent fall in business
from overseas for the lower turnover.
He added that the number of flights arranged had fallen by only 2.7 per cent
but the average expenditure was 13 per cent lower.
The shares fell 7p to 68p.
Earnings per share were 5.6p (8.1p) but directors said that as the company
was still generating cash they were recommending a maintained final dividend
of 1.9p for an unchanged total of 3.5p.

7.81m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp reduction in interest charges, reflecting property sales and falling
interest rates, was behind more than doubled interim profits at Chesterfield
Properties, the investment and development group.
Turnover in the six months to June 30 amounted to Pounds 17.3m, against
Pounds 20.5m restated for FRS 3, including Pounds 13.9m (Pounds 17.9m) from
rental income.
After a profit of Pounds 3.38m on the disposal of its 60 per cent stake in a
warehouse investment and interest payable of Pounds 5.13m (Pounds 9.85m),
pre-tax profits emerged at Pounds 7.81m (Pounds 3.4m).
Interest of Pounds 1.18m (Pounds 1.87m) arising on development properties
was capitalised.
Chesterfield's small entertainment division incurred a deficit of Pounds
184,000 (profit of Pounds 22,000).
Directors said the difficult trading conditions for theatres and cinemas in
London's West End deteriorated further in the first half. 'No improvement is
yet evident', they added.
After tax and minorities, earnings per share jumped from 5.48p to 20.3p; the
interim dividend goes up 0.5p to 4p.

STARMIN, the quarry products company chaired by Lord Parkinson, the former
cabinet minister, is facing a legal claim of more than Pounds 500,000 in
compensation for loss of office from its former chief executive.
Mr Osman Abdullah, whose resignation from the Pounds 160,000-a-year
executive post was announced a month before the company said pre-tax losses
were millions of pounds deeper than previously published, holds a stake of
almost 6 per cent in the company.
'I have to protect myself. One should not confuse my shareholding, my shares
in the company as opposed to my personal situation within the company', he
said.
Starmin said it would 'strenuously resist' the claim: 'We believe the claim
is more than adequately provided for and we are confident that it will not
be successful.'
Mr Abdullah's two brothers hold equal stakes. One of them, Raschid, also
resigned as an executive in July but was recently reappointed as a
non-executive director of Starmin.
The resignations by the brothers, who built up the Evered aggregates
company, coincided with Starmin's announcement of a review of accounting
policies which led to the company rescinding its dividend and announcing
1992 pre-tax losses had been understated by Pounds 3.8m, deepening them to
Pounds 11.9m.
Starmin said at the time that there was no suggestion of fraud.

FT  22 OCT 93 / UK Company News: A drive for clear objectives - Why BSG is
undergoing a strategic review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW medium-size companies are driven by as many component parts as BSG
International.
In Europe, North America, the Far East and Australasia the average car is
likely to be fitted with wing mirrors, lights and a sunroof made by one of
the group's subsidiaries.
If it is a family car there is a good chance the child seats have been
manufactured by another division. In Britain the car itself may have been
leased or sold by the vehicle distribution arm.
In the sky, the next aircraft passing overhead will more often than not be a
Boeing. If so, many of the seats and interior fittings will have come off a
BSG production line.
Unfortunately for the Midlands-based group, recession has not been kind to
companies supplying equipment to users of roads and runways. Falling vehicle
demand in continental Europe and for commercial aircraft worldwide has
weakened BSG's performance.
In its recent half-year results, the company blamed weak consumer demand and
falling car and aircraft production for flat pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.53m
against Pounds 8.56m.
Operating profits fell by 5.6 per cent to Pounds 11.1m (Pounds 11.7m) - the
result of airline cutbacks, a 15 per cent drop in European car output and
higher than expected tax charges in some overseas markets.
According to industry analysts, the recession has served to expose some
deeper problems in BSG's four business areas: automotive components;
childcare products; aircraft interior equipment; and vehicle distribution
and leasing.
They say the group is typical of a growing number of companies which are too
diversified and need to re-examine their core activities.
Mr Richard Marton, who took over as chief executive in May, says he
recognised the strains some time ago but is only now in a position to
rectify them.
On October 1 he ordered a strategic review of the group to examine the
entire structure and come up with a corporate plan, which will be
implemented from the start of 1994.
Mr Marton, who was promoted from the company's consumer and special products
division, is honest about the task ahead. 'We have never really addressed
the subject of a well-planned strategy. BSG has not gone very far because in
the past decisions were made on an ad hoc basis. It was divide and rule.'
He claims, however, that the realisation that the group's divisions were
operating without strategic guidance did not grow solely with the worsening
recession. There had been a legacy of little management planning.
Mr Marton is reluctant to criticise directly Mr Tom Cannon, his predecessor
who resigned as managing director in May after 42 years with the company.
But, he says: 'We now have to develop the clear objectives that we've never
had. In the past we didn't have the leadership to set out a new structure,
so this review is long overdue.'
The board, however, was reluctant to sanction an overhaul before it had
strengthened the balance sheet. This it achieved through a Pounds 31.4m
rights issue earlier this year. The funds raised have enabled the group to
cut gearing and proceed with capital expenditure on things it is good at  -
namely, a Pounds 12m expansion of its US mirror plant near Detroit and a
Pounds 7m investment in UK car dealerships.
With the rights issue past, the new chief executive has concentrated on
earmarking areas ripe for restructuring.
As part of that process, the divisional structure has already been
reorganised. The three operating arms  - automotive, vehicle distribution
and leasing, and consumer and special products which embraces aircraft parts
and childcare goods  - have been sub-divided along regional lines.
This is the foundation for the three-month review and reflects widely
varying margins on BSG products in different markets. In the automotive
division, for example, operating margins are healthy in North America and
the Far East where the group's Britax subsidiaries have won lucrative
contracts with companies such as Ford, Chrysler, GM, Mazda and Mitsubishi.
But in Europe and the UK, falling car output has tightened margins.
Meanwhile, the lossmaking aircraft parts operation has won some big seat
orders from airlines but turnover has declined because Boeing, its main
customer, has scaled back 737 production.
These areas are now being scrutinised by a strategic review committee, which
is likely to identify activities which no longer fit in with Mr Marton's
vision of a focused company.
Potential candidates for disposal include Britax Weathershields, the sunroof
manufacturer, the pushchair and nursery furniture side of the Britax
childcare division, and Rumbold, the aircraft interiors subsidiary.
Mr Marton refuses to pre-empt the findings of the review committee, but
admits 'we'll be stronger if we dispose of one or two product areas'.
The existence of such a committee, involving senior divisional managers and
the main board, reflects his determination to arrive at a consensus on the
group's future direction.
The growing opinion among analysts is that BSG needs to shed some
operations. But they warn it would be unwise to put its aircraft business on
the market before it could demonstrate a return to profitability.
Mr Marton acknowledges their concerns and says the company is not rushing to
amputate lossmaking areas.
'We know we have to be fitter and more focused; that will take time. We also
need to build values into the company  - we've never had values before.'

FT  22 OCT 93 / UK Company News: David Brown pays Pounds 11m for Powell arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAVID BROWN Group, the West Yorkshire-based specialist engineering company,
has agreed to buy the hydraulics and transmissions division of Hamworthy
from Powell Duffryn for Pounds 11.1m.
It is the first acquisition by David Brown since it was floated in April
with a market value of Pounds 90m.
The group's shares, which were launched at 170p, yesterday closed 22p higher
at 223p.
The Hamworthy businesses being sold make power and drive systems for
off-highway vehicles, transmissions for light rail traction, and a variety
of gears.
They employ 630 people on two sites in Poole and Bath, and 90 sales and
service staff overseas.
The businesses are currently breaking even after three years of losses and
are likely to be extensively restructured by their new owners.
Mr Chris Cook and Mr Chris Brown, joint chief executives of David Brown,
reduced their workforce by 400 to 1,400 in the three years before flotation,
and said cuts of a similar magnitude would be required to get the
acquisition to an acceptable level of profitability.
The enlarged group will have five UK gears plants, including the existing
David Brown plants at Huddersfield and Penistone, in Yorkshire, and
Sunderland.
A Pounds 6.2m provision for reorganisation covers the costs of closing one
of the gear plants, although no decision will be made until the operations
at Poole and Bath have been studied.
The chief executives said that as well as the initial benefits from
cost-saving and rationalisation, the enlarged group would benefit from
complementary product lines and a strong international sales network, which
David Brown currently lacks.
Powell Duffryn, the distribution, storage and engineering group, said the
disposal of this division would sharpen the focus of the remaining Hamworthy
businesses  - marine equipment, combustion and compressor systems.
Some Pounds 8.4m of the cash consideration will be raised by the placing of
4.4m new shares at 190p. The shares will be placed by BZW with institutional
investors, but will be subject to clawback by existing shareholders on a
1-for-12 basis.

FT  22 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Safeland seeks Pounds 1.6m for expansion
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Safeland is raising Pounds 1.58m net through a 1-for-3 underwritten rights
issue. The property development and investment group also announced an
increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 36,000 to Pounds 345,000 for
the six months to September 30.
The company, a subsidiary of the Panama-incorporated Safeland Holdings, said
there were signs of improvement in the property market and the proceeds
would be used for acquisitions mainly in the retail sector.
Safeland Holdings will not be taking up its rights entitlement resulting in
its holding falling from 55.93 per cent to 41.95 per cent.
The Lipman directors, who include Mr Ray Lipman, chairman, and Mr Larry
Lipman, managing director, will be taking up half their shares, leaving
their aggregate holdings at 9.06 per cent, down from 10.35 per cent.
A total of 6.28m shares are being offered at 28p each. Safeland's shares
closed at 44p, down 1p on the day.
Directors were optimistic that progress would continue.
Turnover was Pounds 4.78m (Pounds 5.99m). The pre-tax result was a 42 per
cent increase on the total for the whole of the previous year.
Earnings per share were 1.25p (0.13p) and the interim dividend is raised to
0.6p (0.06p).

FT  22 OCT 93 / UK Company News: BB&amp;EA back in the black with Pounds 2.3m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Including a full contribution from companies acquired from BM Group,
turnover of British Building &amp; Engineering Appliances surged from Pounds
7.8m to Pounds 43.4m while the building products concern returned to profits
with Pounds 2.31m pre-tax for the year to June 30.
The outcome compared with losses of Pounds 1.29m for the previous 15 months.
BM has disposed of its 75 per cent holding in BB&amp;EA, amounting to 8.41m
shares, by way of a placing for Pounds 16m net by Albert E Sharp.
Mr Bob Paine, recently appointed chairman, said that BB&amp;EA was greatly
expanded in June 1992 when new management took over the running of the
company. Now fully independent it would seek to expand both by acquisition
and organic growth.
On prospects Mr Paine stated that order levels and some prices were showing
improvements over last year, while the effects of cost savings already
implemented were now working through.
Earnings per share amounted to 14.2p (60.2p losses) and the dividend is
lifted to 8p (nil) with a proposed final of 5.5p.

FT  22 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Bristol Channel Ship launches Pounds 19m
rights - Proceeds to fund acquisitions from Ugland family
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRISTOL CHANNEL Ship Repairers is to launch a rights issue to fund three
acquisitions from the Norwegian shipping family that took control earlier
this year after an acrimonious struggle.
The issue is expected to raise almost Pounds 19m net of expenses.
The company will pay a total of Pounds 16.1m for Ugland Brothers, a ship
management business, UB Shipping, which owns nine general cargo vessels, and
a deep sea car carrying vessel.
Mr Andreas Ugland, chairman designate of BCSR, and his family interests hold
almost 30 per cent of the shares. The Ugland group of companies are taking
up their full entitlement of the rights.
BCSR shareholders will vote on the proposals, including a name change to
Ugland International, at an extraordinary meeting on November 15.
Mr Ugland plans to concentrate on managing and developing the company.
The board argues that the combination of BCSR's updated repair operations in
Swansea with the Ugland businesses will 'provide the foundations for a
significant intergrated international shipping group.'
BCSR's shares were suspended in August at 8p pending the reorganisation. The
80m existing 10p shares will be consolidated into 4m ordinary shares, with a
nominal value of 20p and an effective worth of 160p.
The company is offering a further 19.96m ordinary shares at 100p each. After
the rights the share capital will consist of 23.96m ordinary 20p shares.
The balance of the rights issue after the Ugland take-up is underwritten by
Nomura International.
Joint stockbrokers to the issue are Kleinwort Benson in the UK and
Fondsfinans in Norway.
The cancellation of the 10p shares and commencement of dealings in the 20p
shares is expected on November 18.

FT  22 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Refinancing for London &amp; Met
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON &amp; Metropolitan, the property company that was rescued by its banks in
1991 but spent much of the time since in intensive care, yesterday announced
terms of another refinancing.
The agreement includes the conversion of Pounds 29.8m of debt into ordinary
equity, leaving the banks, led by Bank of Scotland, with about 70 per cent
of the equity.
Existing shareholdings will be diluted down to 25 per cent of the equity.
The maturity of a further Pounds 25.8m of debt has been extended and the
banks are to make available a new working capital facility of Pounds 4.5m.
Some of the group's other banking facilities have been made non-recourse,
helping to reduce net liabilities by Pounds 31.7m.
The restructuring leaves London &amp; Metropolitan with positive net worth of
Pounds 1.2m and assets per share of 2.7p. Before the deal the group had
negative net worth of Pounds 60.3m.
London &amp; Metropolitan became over-exposed in the late 1980s, a
developer-trader with little investment income. In 1991 the banks rescued
the company on the assumption that the property market recession would not
persist.
The company developed, but no longer owns, the Whiteleys shopping complex in
Bayswater and Distillers House in St James Square. It still has a small
investment portfolio.
Mr Chris Harris, chairman and managing director, said the restructuring was
a vote of confidence in the current management's ability to take the group
forward.
'We have some interesting new opportunities like factory outlet shopping',
he said.
Under the restructuring preference shares are being converted to deferred
shares and cancelled.
The group also announced that for the six months to June 30 it incurred a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.45m (Pounds 4.44m) on turnover of Pounds 14.9m
(Pounds 19.6m).
Losses per share were 5.6p compared with 6.8p.

FT  22 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Parkland shares surge on enfranchisement
proposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES OF Parkland Textile (Holdings) soared yesterday as the woollen yarn
and worsted cloth manufacturer accompanied a sharp recovery in interim
profits with a proposed enfranchisement of its A shares.
The ordinary shares surged 105p to 365p while the A shares jumped 48p to
221p.
On the back of a 15 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 27.1m in the half
year to August 27, the Bradford-based group swung from losses of Pounds
309,000 to profits of Pounds 970,000 pre-tax.
The interim dividend is doubled to 2p, payable from earnings of 12.1p
(losses of 4.8p).
The directors anticipated that generally stable conditions would prevail in
the second half 'provided the threat of increased taxation does not affect
consumer confidence.'
Following receipt of part of the proceeds of a discontinued business half
year gearing was reduced from 43.2 per cent to 26.2 per cent.
Interest charges were trimmed from Pounds 464,000 to Pounds 231,000.
In the yarn division, volumes remained static but margins improved
'modestly' at Knoll Spinning largely because of increased exports.
Volume advances generated by the fabric division in 1992-93 continued
throughout the first half with 'considerable growth' achieved in all areas.
To compensate for dilution of their voting rights, existing ordinary
shareholders will receive a scrip issue on a 4-for-5 basis.
The group is to change its name to Parkland Group.

FT  22 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Starters' orders for three London
racecourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EPSOM, home of the Derby, came under starters orders yesterday as the
Horserace Betting Levy Board put it up for sale along with Kempton Park and
Sandown Park.
The board  - a statutory body which collects a levy from bookmakers for the
benefit of the racing industry  - acquired the three courses more than 20
years ago.
Together they comprise almost 1,000 acres of land inside the M25, and were
considered to be in danger from property developers. Estimates of their
value now range between Pounds 20m and Pounds 50m.
Mr Rodney Brack, chairman of the Levy Board, said yesterday that the
privatisation of the courses, which traded profitably last year, had been
under consideration for the past two years.
Racecourse Holdings Trust, a subsidiary of the Jockey Club, immediately said
it would be making an offer. The trust owns nine courses, including
Cheltenham and Newmarket, and ploughs all its profits back into racing.
Mr David Hillyard, managing director, said the value would have to be based
on the possible returns from racing, and dismissed a figure of Pounds 50m as
'fanciful.'
Mr Tim Neligan, managing director of United Racecourses, said that the trust
seems to be the favourite.

FT  22 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Lower exceptionals help A Fisher - Shares
fall after chairman strikes cautious note on current year outcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Albert Fisher fell 5p to 75p yesterday after the food processing
and distribution group struck a cautious note when announcing its annual
results.
The group made pre-tax profits of Pounds 31.5m in the year to August 31,
compared with a restated Pounds 25.9m under FRS 3. This was after an
exceptional charge of Pounds 15.4m to cover disposals, compared with Pounds
34.2m previously.
Total sales rose from Pounds 1.2bn to Pounds 1.28bn.
Mr Stephen Walls, executive chairman, said: 'The outcome for the current
year will continue to be affected by the pace of economic recovery in our
markets as well as the need for restoration of greater balance in supply and
demand in key products and markets.'
However, he also stated that there had been considerable progress made in
repositioning the group by strengthening management, reducing costs,
acquiring complementary businesses and disposing of non-core operations.
Operating income from European food processing fell from Pounds 28.4m to
Pounds 21.5m. The company blamed a large part of the decline to Mondi Foods,
its frozen fruit and fruit concentrate business, which was hit by a
worldwide glut of apples and the political upheaval in eastern Europe, which
resulted in large falls in volumes and prices.
The European seafood division increased operating income from Pounds 7.7m to
Pounds 10m. The group said synergies between the companies had been realised
during the year, particularly the networking of sales.
Operating income from the European fresh produce division fell from Pounds
7.5m to Pounds 6.4m.
North American fresh produce increased operating income from Pounds 10.8m to
Pounds 11.6m. Early signs of recovery in the south-east of the US were not
sustained consistently in the second half, and the West Coast  - in
particular southern California  - continued in recession.
Earnings per share rose to 2.49p (1.78p). The final dividend was held at
1.9p to maintain the final at 3.75p.
COMMENT
The share price fall was not surprising, given the caution over trading and
the fact that the shares had already doubled in the last year. The City is
pleased that Mr Walls seems to have completed the first phase of his
clean-up after the reign of his acquisitive predecessor, Mr Tony Millar.
However, serious doubts remain over whether the group can secure high-margin
business  - or will remain dogged by the random fall-out from produce gluts,
crop failures and political turmoil. Forecast full-year profits of Pounds
53m put the shares on an undemanding prospective multiple of 12.5. They are
underpinned at that level by a yield of more than 6 per cent. There seems
little downside at this level, but the shares will not be significantly
uprated unless and until profits represent a more significant proportion of
sales.

FT  22 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Jarvis cuts deficit to Pounds 630,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JARVIS, which is involved in property investment, construction and
development, cut pre-tax losses from Pounds 1.72m to Pounds 630,000 for the
six months to June 30.
Mr Harvey Bard, chairman, said the improvement followed actions taken last
year to reduce operating capacity, and the continuation of the policy of
only bidding for work when a positive margin could be anticipated.
The building division continued to experience poor trading conditions, he
said. Civil engineering had improved its order book though margins had
remained tight. Following a reconstruction the fitting-out company had
achieved a significant improvement.
Mr Bard said that in the second half a further loss was expected in the
construction side. That would be partly offset, however, by an additional
contribution from property investments.
In June, Jarvis acquired a 34 per cent interest in Chapel Wharf, a joint
venture company formed to develop a 9 acre site in Salford. Its two partners
are DC Thompson and the City of Salford.
Turnover declined to Pounds 36m (Pounds 48m). Losses per share were reduced
to 2.8p (8.1p) and again there is no dividend.

FT  22 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Gleeson withstands recession with Pounds
8.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MJ GLEESON yesterday became the second family-run, small, quoted
construction company this week to withstand the worst effects of the
recession, reporting pre-tax profits down from Pounds 9.94m to Pounds 8.2m
in the year to June 30.
Earnings per share fell to 57.54p (67.1p). However, using the strong balance
sheet as justification, the board is proposing a maintained final dividend
of 9.4p giving a same-again total of 12.75p.
'We have never become over exposed in any one area,' said Mr Colin McLellan,
finance director. 'We have tended, in good years, to invest money in land
and commercial property in a small way. We have never got involved in huge
schemes.'
On Monday, Henry Boot, the Sheffield-based construction and property
company, announced pre-tax profits up from Pounds 2.21m to Pounds 2.35m.
Gleeson said prospects for the UK construction industry were poor, although
the housebuilding division had experienced an improvement in sales during
the past half year.
Turnover fell to Pounds 168m (Pounds 183.1m) as building, contracting and
civil engineering declined. 'There was a lot of competition and not enough
work,' said Mr McLellan.
A decline in gross profit to Pounds 15.1m (Pounds 18m) was not offset by
higher rental income of Pounds 5.02m (Pounds 4.6m). The company said it had
let more properties.
Although cash balances rose from Pounds 13.5m to Pounds 16.1m over the year,
interest received fell to Pounds 831,000 (Pounds 1.72m) as rates fell.
Interest payments fell to Pounds 58,000 (Pounds 326,000) the company having
redeemed Pounds 2.8m in loan notes issued at the time of the 1991
acquisition of Colroy, the housebuilder. The cash was generated by rental
income and the selling of more land than it bought in its housebuilding
division.
'Work in progress went down by about Pounds 3m. We are keen to buy more land
but land prices seem to us to be rising faster than house prices,' said Mr
McLellan.
The company said planned spending on housing land and investment property
meant that bank balances were unlikely to be sustained at year end levels.

FT  22 OCT 93 / UK Company News: WPP in Dollars 14.6m disposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WPP, the heavily-indebted marketing services group, has sold its 64 per cent
interest in Fallon McElligott, the US advertising agency, for Dollars 14.6m
(Pounds 9.6m), writes Diane Summers.
The group owns 80 per cent of Scali, McCabe, Slaves, the US advertising
network, which, in turn, owns 80 per cent of Fallon McElligott.
WPP said Dollars 10m of the Dollars 14.6m was paid in cash and the balance
in an interest-bearing note repayable over five years. The group said the
effect of Fallon's results on WPP's consolidated revenue and trading profits
had been 'immaterial'. The sale, which was to Fallon's management, 'does not
give rise to any material exceptional charge or gain,' said WPP.
In the half year to June 30 WPP's average net debt was Pounds 372m. Last
month it sold Seiniger Advertising, the Los Angeles-based producer of
marketing campaigns for films, for Dollars 6.9m.

FT  22 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Two further Lloyd's trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PATHFINDER prospectuses for two investment trusts for the Lloyd's insurance
market backed by Samuel Montagu and SG Warburg were published yesterday.
Names voted on Wednesday in favour of new rules permitting Lloyd's to draw
capital from corporate members.
New London Capital, which is sponsored by SG Warburg, aims to raise Pounds
160m, mainly from institutions. Advised by Chartwell Advisers, a subsidiary
of Chartwell Re, a London reinsurance company, it will focus on about 20
separate syndicates, targeting specific sectors of the Lloyd's market.
London Insurance Market Investment Trust will be the largest of the new
corporate members. It is sponsored by Samuel Montagu, the merchant bank, and
James Capel and aims to raise about Pounds 280m, although this could be
increased to Pounds 300m.
It is expected that some Pounds 70m of this amount will come from retail
investors, the remainder having been conditionally placed with institutions.
Applications will be for a minimum of 1,000 shares at an offer price of
Pounds 100 per share.
Limit says that it has obtained binding commitments from 98 syndicates for
the provision of Pounds 480m of underwriting capacity.
New corporate members can underwrite Pounds 2 of premium income for every
Pounds 1 of capital. Eight agencies manage 56 of the syndicates which will
be supported by Limit.
Fenchurch Underwriting Agencies, the Lloyd's agency, has been retained to
advise on a consultancy basis, but Limit does not intend to appoint an
external Lloyd's adviser.
Approximately 90 per cent of funds will be invested in a portfolio of listed
equities, with the balance invested partly in sterling fixed interest
securities.

FT  22 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Ferguson advances to Pounds 5.24m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FERGUSON International Holdings, the labels, hangers, communications
components, printing and publishing group, reported pre-tax profits up from
Pounds 4.7m to Pounds 5.24m in the six months to August 31.
The rise was struck on turnover up from Pounds 61.8m  - of which Pounds
3.86m was from discontinued operations  - to Pounds 65.6m.
Mr Denis Cassidy, chairman, called it 'a good first-half performance'. Three
of the four divisions lifted operating profits, while sales grew at all
four.
Further, the group has secured, as successor to Mr Michael Saint, Mr Ronald
Irving of Christian Salvesen as group managing director.
Profits in labels, the group's main business, grew 11 per cent to Pounds
3.03m on turnover up 8 per cent to Pounds 30.2m, three quarters of which
comes from the UK. Some 60 per cent of the labels are for clothes and the
balance for food, though Design Mark Industries of the US, which makes
pressure sensitive panels, also falls within the division. Work has been
carried out to restore to profit the Hong Kong labels business, which is
essential for clothing manufacturers which source from the Far East.
Lower prices in Europe led to profits falling to Pounds 1.21m (Pounds 1.33m)
in hangers on turnover up at Pounds 16.6m (Pounds 15.6m). Earlier this
month, Ferguson bought Red Wing Products for Dollars 11.5m (Pounds 7.5m),
giving the hangers side a US presence.
Profits at the US cable components side were up 42 per cent to Pounds 1.02m
on turnover up 47 per cent to Pounds 13.1m, though stripping out currency
gains reduces the rises to 17 and 21 per cent respectively.
The disposal of the printing and publishing division, which made Pounds
344,000 (Pounds 243,000) on sales of Pounds 5.61m (Pounds 5.46m), has not
yet been completed.
Earnings rose to 10.4p (9.3p) per share and the interim dividend is held at
4.25p.

FT  22 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Frost seeks Pounds 21.3m to repay bank
borrowings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROST GROUP, the UK's largest independent petrol retailer, yesterday
launched a cash call to raise Pounds 21.3m to repay bank debt and clear the
way for further acquisitions.
The 5-for-1 rights issue of 11.7m new shares at 187p apiece is fully
underwritten by Credit Lyonnais Laing. Frost's shares slipped 1p to 224p.
Without the issue the company believed debt would reach some Pounds 18.4m by
its December year-end which would mean gearing of 60 per cent of balance
sheet values.
After the issue Frost will have about Pounds 3m in cash and the company will
be ungeared.
Mr James Frost, chairman, said: 'This leaves us in a similar position to two
years ago when we floated. The difference is two years ago we had 79 sites
and by the year end we expect to have 180.
'The long term target at the time of the float was to get to 250 sites.
Because we have purchased at an accelerated rate we now expect to reach that
target in the short term with a new long term target of 500 sites.'
The company expects to have invested Pounds 32.6m in the acquisition and
redevelopment of petrol retailing sites by the end of 1993.
'We believe that, in the near future, there will be many further
opportunities to acquire sites on advantageous terms, provided that the
group has the balance sheet strength and financial flexibility to be able to
act quickly.'

25m-Pounds 30m.

the shares, reducing the stake held by himself and his family trusts to
about 41 per cent. The pension fund is placing a further 16 per cent and
directors, employees and former employees are selling a further tranche,
making a total of 32.5 per cent.
The first day of trading is November 11.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Invergordon loses independence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHYTE &amp; MACKAY, the UK drinks subsidiary of American Brands, has won its
two-year battle to gain control of Invergordon, the independent Scotch
whisky producer.
Invergordon's fate was sealed by the decision of Fleming Investment
Management (FIM) - after two weeks of haggling - to sell its 13.5 per cent
stake for 300p a share. Analysts had expected FIM to hold out for more, but
SG Warburg, FIM's financial adviser, considered 300p 'a good price',
according to Whyte &amp; Mackay.
The deal, which values Invergordon at Pounds 382.4m, lifted Whyte &amp; Mackay's
holding to 54.7 per cent from the 41.2 per cent amassed during its
unsuccessful 1991 bid.
The sale of the FIM stake triggered an unconditional final cash offer of
300p for the rest of the shares.
Invergordon's board, which is advised by Robert Fleming, part of the same
group as FIM, said it was seeking discussions on certain issues - believed
to include the future of the company's management and employees. It urged
shareholders to take no action, and said: 'This price fails to recognise the
strategic value to Whyte &amp; Mackay of Invergordon's business.'
Mr Chris Greig, Invergordon's managing director, said the loss of
independence was 'a great disappointment'. 'I believe that Whyte &amp; Mackay
should have put a formal offer to the board so that the interests of all our
shareholders could be taken into account.
'But one has to face the reality of City situations. FIM was perfectly
entitled to sell its shares.'
Mr Greig, who led the group through a Pounds 93m management buy-out from
Hawker Siddeley in 1988 to a Pounds 172m market flotation two years later,
has a 3.3 per cent stake in the company, now worth about Pounds 12.6m. Other
directors and employees hold a further 7.5 per cent of the equity.
Mr Michael Lunn, Whyte &amp; Mackay's chairman and chief executive, said: 'I
would like an early meeting with Invergordon to see how we can work together
to develop the complementary nature of the two businesses.
'We have different skills which would create a strong combined force in the
Scotch whisky industry. That is what our attempt to gain control of
Invergordon has been about. It is not a cost-cutting exercise.'
The combined companies would form the third largest Scotch producer.
Invergordon would contribute its strength in own-label Scotch, a rapidly
growing sector which is expected to account for 30 per cent of UK whisky
sales this year, as well as brands such as Cluny and Glayva liqueur. These
would be complemented by Whyte &amp; Mackay's Scotch whiskies, as well as
Vladivar vodka, and its bourbon and rum brands.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Aer Lingus losses top IPounds 190m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Bernie Cahill, chairman of Aer Lingus, Ireland's troubled state-run
airline, described the past year as the 'most traumatic in its 57-year
history' in announcing a pre-tax loss of IPounds 190.7m (Pounds 183m)
yesterday.
The losses for the year to March 31 underline the urgent need for the group
to implement its rescue plan  - stalled in negotiations with trade unions  -
if the airline is to survive. The previous year's pre-tax loss was limited
to IPounds 3.1m.
On turnover of IPounds 817m, Aer Lingus suffered underlying operating losses
of IPounds 22.9m, in the core air transport division, compared with a loss
of IPounds 16.2m in 1991-92. Exceptional charges totalled IPounds 143.6m,
made up of IPounds 99.8m restructuring costs and IPounds 43.9m to cover the
total write-off of the airline's shareholding in GPA, the Shannon-based
aircraft leasing company.
Mr Cahill said that the scale of the trading losses coupled with the
weakening of the balance sheet 'raised serious questions about the future of
the group'.
Gearing at the end of March stood at 533 per cent, up from 109 per cent two
years ago. As net debt is IPounds 540m, this implies the group has
shareholders' funds of only some IPounds 100m.
The company is losing about IPounds 1.2m per week and is seeking to cut
IPounds 50m from annual operating costs of about IPounds 600m.
Management and unions, however, have been unable to agree on either the
nature or the scale of the restructuring plan. The Irish Labour Relations
Commission is acting as arbitrator, but if agreement is not reached by
October 31, the company has said it will proceed anyway.
A voluntary redundancy scheme to shed 1,280 of the 5,500 workforce has
attracted only 900 acceptances. The company has said that only 314 of these
can be released without serious changes in working practices, describing
this issue as central.
A proposed equity injection of IPounds 175m by the government  - and EC
approval of it  - is conditional on a viable rescue plan being implemented.
Without the capital injection, it is unlikely that the airline's bankers
will be willing to extend further credit.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Guinness in China link with LVMH
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUINNESS yesterday reinforced its alliance with LVMH, the French luxury
goods and drinks group, by forming a new joint venture operation in China.
The venture is the 16th to be established in international Scotch whisky and
cognac markets since the two companies became partners in 1987. Another
joint operation is expected to be announced shortly.
Speculation about the future relationship between the companies  - and in
particular their 24 per cent cross-shareholdings  - has been rampant in
recent weeks. Their performance has been hit by recession in many world
markets and their share prices have been under pressure amid rumours that
the alliance would be restructured.
However, Mr Tony Greener, Guinness chairman and chief executive, yesterday
stressed: 'This latest joint venture serves to reinforce our relationship
with LVMH. The cross-shareholding supports our global network which has
served both companies well for the past six years.'
Riche Monde China, the new company formed by LVMH and United Distillers, the
Guinness spirits division, has already recruited a sales staff of 60 and
intends to increase the number of employees to more than 150 by 1995.
Mr Greener, who has just returned from a visit to UD's operations in Asia,
said: 'China, with its population of 1.2bn, represents a huge opportunity
for us in the long term. It is estimated that international brands account
for only 1.4 per cent of the spirits market at present.
'But once the infrastructure is in place to deliver the product to the
market, China could be a 20m case annual market for premium branded imported
spirits by the next century.'
Total UD Scotch sales in China are expected to be close to 1m bottles this
year. Sales of Johnnie Walker Black Label, its de luxe Scotch brand,
increased by 70 per cent in the first half.
LVMH's Hennessy cognac, the other best-selling spirits brand in the
portfolio of the new company, is established as market leader in its premium
category.
Joint venture agreements between the two companies already operate in Hong
Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, France, Ireland, the US
and Mexico.

FT  22 OCT 93 / TelecomAsia to raise Dollars 400m on Bangkok exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TELECOMASIA (TA), a subsid-iary of the multinational Charoen Pokphand group,
plans to raise about Dollars 400m (Pounds 268m) through a partial public
flotation on the Stock Exchange of Thailand, which is expected to value the
whole of TA at about Dollars 4bn.
TA has received permission to list 223m new shares on the exchange. The
existing 2bn shares are 85 per cent owned by the CP group and 15 per cent by
Nynex of the US.
Foreign investors will be able to buy about 40 per cent of the new shares,
with the rest going to Thais, according to stockbrokers in Bangkok. The
company has appointed 60 local finance and securities companies to
underwrite the issue.
The flotation reflects the ambitions of governments and telecommunications
operators in the region. TA has a franchise to build 2m telephone lines in
the Bangkok area. Another consortium, including the Japanese operator NTT,
has a franchise to build 1m lines in the provinces, sharing a proportion of
the network revenue with TOT, the domestic telecoms concern.
TA, whose main overseas underwriter is Salomon Brothers, begins a publicity
'roadshow' in Hong Kong today, moving on to Europe and the US.
With about 3 lines per 100 people, Thailand is better placed than India, the
Philippines and China, but behind the economic leaders in the region. Hong
Kong has 47 lines per 100; Taiwan and South Korea about 35.
Mr Andrew Harrington, Salomon Brother's Asia telecoms analyst, estimates
that by 1997 Thailand will have about 4.5m lines  - 9 per 100 people.
The price will be set later and the shares offered to the public from
November 22 to 26, with official trading starting in mid-December.
Stockbrokers expect a price of 40-50 baht per share.
Mr Veeravat Kanchanadul, TA vice-chairman, said the money would be used for
projects in Thailand, China and IndoChina and 'value-added' services.
TA recently raised Dollars 1.9bn in project financing for its Dollars 3.2bn
contract to install 2m new telephone lines in Bangkok.
TA has plans to take a stake in a satellite launch venture for China and to
install 100,000 lines in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and at least 200,000
lines in China's Hubei province.
TA predicts that it will emerge from loss in 1994 to reach a net profit of
Bt3bn in 1995, rising to Bt14bn in 1998.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Transatlantic lesson in passing on risks: John Gapper
explains banks' moves to securitise assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few predictions appear as safe as the notion that the European market in
securitised assets is about to grow explosively, yet few have been proved
wrong so many times. The gap between the enormous US market and the infant
one across the Atlantic has grown wider with each false dawn.
Yet this time, the prediction could be right. The UK high street banks, with
their huge capacity to generate assets such as mortgages and personal loans
that can be securitised, may have detonated the explosion. 'It is finally
starting to move,' says Mr Robin Monro-Davies, of IBCA, the European bank
ratings agency.
There has been a flurry of milestone deals involving banks in the past few
weeks. Barclays made a Pounds 280m issue backed by 10,000 personal loans and
National Westminster has made a Pounds 300m mortgage-backed issue. Both
these banks have publicly declared their interest in future securitisations.
These transactions have raised the prospect of the European asset-backed
securities market both growing and spreading into more exotic areas, such as
credit card receivables. There are Dollars 1,000bn of US mortgage-backed
securities alone, while only Dollars 1.4bn were issued in Europe last year.
The market could subside again, as it did following issues by centralised
mortgage lenders in the mid-1980s, under the housing market collapse. But
the high street banks' involvement may mark a turning point because of their
dual role as both issuers and investors. The banks have enormous power as
issuers because they have ready access to huge asset pools. Once they have
borne initial costs of securitisation, including legal fees and paying for
ratings agencies to give their processing systems a seal of approval, they
have a ready supply of useable assets.
Their reputation as large and safe institutions also means their issues set
benchmarks for what has been a rather imponderable market. 'Until these
deals, nobody knew exactly how a quality institution could price a deal,'
says Mr Guy Fletcher, Barclays' head of asset securitisation.
On the other side, banks' willingness to invest in asset-backed securities
provides demand. The Bank of England cleared a barrier at the end of last
year when it said banks could hold mortgage-backed securities as assets with
a 50 per cent weighting, absorbing less capital.
Securitisation has a number of attractions for banks:
It allows them to devolve credit risks to investors. 'One sacrifices an
earnings stream, but the risk is reduced even more sharply,' says Mr Richard
Goeltz, NatWest's chief financial officer.
By selling assets to the vehicle companies which issue bonds, banks can
release the capital which they must hold against assets under regulatory
guidelines. This means that they can both raise return on capital by
're-using' it and add assets without breaching capital adequacy limits.
They can diversify their sources of funding. This could have particular
attractions for building societies, which operate under strict limits on
wholesale funding and face strong retail funding pressures.
If the market expands, their investment banking arms may be able to
securitise assets on behalf of client companies. This would form a parallel
with the derivatives trading expertise which banks have started using both
to hedge their risks and offer risk management services.
Given these attractions, why have banks been slow to move into
securitisation? Mainly because it has been too expensive. Banks not only
have to pay the legal costs of setting up vehicle companies, but must ensure
that their securities attract investors.
One reason for the rapid growth of the US market is that the US government
guaranteed the assets underlying the first mortgage-backed issues by
agencies such as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. 'There is no guarantee here, so
credit risks have to be studied carefully by agencies and investors,' says
Mr Fletcher.
Asset-backed securities also face the difficulty that it is impossible to
predict their exact maturity. Mortgages will be repaid at different speeds
depending on interest rate movements, creating the 'pre-payment risk'
suffered by US investors.
Banks thus have to offer an attractive margin  - 20 and 40 basis points over
Libor for the two main parts of NatWest's Pounds 300m issue. They also have
to inject some extra capital to compensate for defaults by borrowers.
NatWest injected an extra Pounds 3m 'shortfall fund'.
While the attractions now seem to outweigh the costs, the question remains
of whether banks face unforeseen risks. Mr Robert Weir, treasurer of
Household Mortgage Corporation, says the only threat is to their reputation.
'The bonds might be issued by something called Lombard, but everybody knows
it is really NatWest,' says Mr Weir. Any issue which had problems would thus
affect NatWest's reputation. Yet it would not be able to use other capital
to help investors because of the Chinese wall between it and the vehicle
company.
For the moment, such theoretical risks appear distant in a market with such
huge potential. Mr Goeltz thinks packaging assets for sale should be a
routine technique for banks. 'Securitisation is not witchcraft. It is a
straightforward tool for managing assets and liabilities.'

FT  22 OCT 93 / More NHS job losses planned: About 2,000 administrative
posts to go in proposed restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LARGE NUMBERS of National Health Service administrative jobs will be lost
under proposals to simplify the management structure announced by Mrs
Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, yesterday.
Unison, the public service union, estimated that the plans would mean 2,000
job losses in addition to 3,000 administrative posts that it says have gone
already this year.
Ministers say every effort will be made to minimise compulsory redundancies
when the 14 English regional health authorities are reduced to eight next
year and the service's Leeds-based management executive is slimmed down.
Mrs Bottomley was announcing her decisions on an internal review into the
higher level structure of the NHS now that the management of hospitals has
been devolved to local level.
The proposed eight amalgamated regions will have only a short life as
statutory authorities. Legislation to abolish regional authorities from 1996
will be introduced next year. The authorities will be replaced by regional
offices of the management executive, which is answerable to Mrs Bottomley
for the day-to-day running of the NHS.
Mrs Bottomley said she would limit the budgets of the management executive
and regional offices in order to 'bear down on administrative costs to
maximise spending on patients'. The existing regions and executive cost
Pounds 200m a year to run.
A battle over the extent to which the NHS needs direct government regulation
since the 1991 health reforms has been fought out behind the review.
Although the government said yesterday's plans were based on the review
committee's preferred option, the team offered more radical alternatives in
its report.
It suggested a formal separation between the Department of Health and the
NHS through the creation of an English National Health Authority, or that
the management executive could become an arm's-length agency.
Mrs Bottomley decided that separating the service from the department could
reduce parliamentary and public accountability. The management executive
will remain within the Department of Health but develop a more clearly
defined head office identity.
Even though Mrs Bottomley has taken a relatively cautious approach, critics
immediately accused her of further centralising the service and reducing
public accountability. Unison said the proposals were a denial of democracy
while Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said they were rampant
bureaucracy and would reduce accountability.
While regional health authorities are not elected, they have members
appointed to represent community interests. Critics fear the community link
would be undermined if they were replaced by Civil Service regional offices.
Mrs Bottomley intends to appoint a non-executive member from each of the
eight regions to sit on the NHS policy board in London. But this will not
satisfy campaigners for greater accountability.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Average US worker's output beats Japan, research shows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AVERAGE Japanese industrial worker is only 83 per cent as productive as
the average American and only slightly ahead of the average German, research
shows.
Manufacturing productivity in Japan, according to a study from McKinsey, the
international management consultants, is world-beating only in certain
industries. Japan maintains a clear lead in internationally traded goods
such as cars, steel and consumer electronics.
But in brewing, US workers produce half again as many pints per head as the
Japanese, and twice as many as the Germans. In food manufacturing, Japan's
output per hour worked is only a third of America's.
Japan's poor record in food, the study says, is largely due to protectionism
and the weakness of Japanese retailers. Japan has more than three times as
many food processing establishments as the US. Whereas the top five food
retailers in Germany account for 43 per cent of the market, and in the US
for 21 per cent, the figure in Japan is only 5 per cent.
The key to improving productivity, McKinsey says, is global competition. In
a truly global industry such as computers, there is little difference
between the US and Japan, although the US retains a slight edge.
In car manufacturing, the US has been goaded into catching up with Japan by
the challenge of Japanese car plants set up in the US in the 1980s.
The study concludes that the best way to improve productivity is through
foreign direct investment, rather than exports. Transplants introduce higher
productivity standards into a country.
This also represents a big opportunity for global manufacturers, McKinsey
says. Because there are such large variations in productivity between
countries within the same industry, manufacturers can increase their profits
by transferring their methods abroad.

FT  22 OCT 93 / CBI warns of overload in accounting requirements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW ACCOUNTING standards are coming too thick and fast for companies to cope
with, the Confederation of British Industry warned yesterday.
The pace and volume of standards from the Accounting Standards Board and its
urgent issues task force are 'stretching resources to the limit' for
business, it said.
Mr Howard Davies, the CBI director-general, will express the organisation's
concerns in a document to be circulated this week to the bodies that set
standards for financial reporting, as well as to the Treasury and the
Department of Trade and Industry.
He urges the ASB, the Auditing Practices Board and the Cadbury committee on
corporate governance to give greater consideration to the costs of their
proposals. He said they should also avoid forcing disclosures that put UK
companies at a disadvantage to their international competitors.
The CBI's statement  - which was endorsed as official policy at a council
meeting on Wednesday  - represents an escalation of criticism of the reform
of standards by attacking the ASB directly. The Hundred Group of leading
finance directors has previously focused on the Cadbury committee and the
Auditing Practices Board.
Mr Davies said that the CBI endorsed the objectives of the new standards
setters, but warned: 'At present there is a severe risk of overload and of
ill-considered proposals being set in stone.' In a second letter to the DTI,
he gave industry support for the first time for the campaign to limit
auditors' liability.
Accountants are concerned that they may be sued for the full extent of any
losses when a company collapses, even though faults with their audits may
have been only a minor factor.
The CBI said standards setters needed to improve the phasing of new
proposals; extend consultation on more complex drafts; increase the time
taken to experiment with standards before they become mandatory; and provide
more co-ordination between the different standards bodies.
Mr Keith Hamill, finance director-designate at Forte and chairman of the
CBI's financial reporting panel, said companies had not criticised the ASB
until now for fear of being seen as self-interested at a time when
high-profile corporate collapses had shown the need for reform.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Where bland lead the bland: The Commonwealth conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LIMASSOL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WITH all the pomp and ceremony of the Eurovision song contest, the
Commonwealth conference got under way yesterday.
Proceedings at Nicosia's international conference centre were occasionally
enlivened.
Australia's Paul Keating had a go at the French over the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade, Malaysia's Mahathir Mohamad again complained about the
west's handling of Bosnia. But for the most part, the bland led the bland,
with milestones marked and friendships forged.
There may after all be something to be said for a gathering of world leaders
in which the highlight promised to be an exposition by Mr John Major,
Britain's prime minister, of his views on trade negotiations.
He is due to take the stage for his star turn at a closed session this
afternoon in Limassol.
The prospect may have unsettled many delegates, but if the youngest of the
35 heads of government on the platform had any fears about the ordeal ahead,
he did not show it.
But one would expect nothing less from a soldier.
All the same, exposure to the rigours of a Commonwealth conference must have
made His Excellency Captain Valentine Strasser, the title accorded him in
the official conference handbook, rue the day he staged a coup in Sierra
Leone.
The 27-year-old dictator who seized power last year has already come under
savage attack in the Commonwealth's annual report: his coup was a 'serious
setback' to democracy.
The conventions of the Commonwealth mean that neither Capt Strasser nor his
country were mentioned by name, but it is the club's way of warning a member
that he could be blackballed if he behaved really badly.
Then Capt Strasser had to endure a moving opening session which must have
tested the tolerance of the most hardened democrat on the flag-bedecked
platform in Nicosia's conference centre.
Lights dimmed and spotlights focused on a childrens' choir singing the
Beatles' 'Give Peace a Chance', with a solo from a George Michael
look-alike. Not surprisingly, Capt Strasser has promised an early return to
democracy.
But moving though it was, something was missing.
It was supposed to be a day for looking forward, giving the Commonwealth a
cutting edge. Instead it became a day for nostalgia. Familiar faces were
missing. Dr Hastings Banda, Malawi's nonagenarian life president, is in
South Africa recovering from brain surgery.
Since then, Zambia's Kenneth Kaunda has had democracy thrust upon him and
lost his presidency. KK's absence is keenly felt, together with other giants
of the past.
'I also miss Lee Kuan Yew, I miss Julius Nyerere . . . (long pause) I even
miss Margaret Thatcher,' said a senior Commonwealth official wistfully.
And if the Gatt debate is the highlight of the 1993 Commonwealth conference,
delegates recalling past acrimonious rows that gave so much pleasure may
well get round to another admission: they also miss apartheid.

FT  22 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: US airlines
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The good news is that the US airline market appears to be bouncing back
after incurring collective losses of more than Dollars 4bn last year. The
fare wars which disfigured the market last summer have been abating: both
American Airlines and Northwest Airlines have just reported rare third
quarter profits. The bad news is that US airlines may still lose about
Dollars 2bn this year. The market remains fragile. Even the few profitable
airlines are making highly unsatisfactory returns.
Traffic has been recovering slowly  - particularly on long haul flights  -
while airlines have continued to cut costs. Several carriers have also
reduced capacity by retiring aircraft early, deferring deliveries and
slimming down schedules. Low fuel prices have also helped. However, progress
will be slow. There remains too much capacity in the market for this stage
of the cycle. Several loss-making carriers, which should have expired, have
emerged reinvigorated from Chapter 11. Meanwhile, Southwest Airlines is
unsettling some bigger rivals by operating cut-price services. Continental,
too, is now experimenting with this cheap and cheerless approach.
Sadly, USAir, in which British Airways has a significant investment, has not
yet benefited from the upswing, incurring a Dollars 177.6m third quarter
loss. USAir is heavily exposed to the volatile short haul market and has
been squeezed by Southwest. For the moment BA is sanguine because it
receives a fixed income on its preference shares. It remains a disconcerting
trend nonetheless.

FT  22 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Unit trusts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The humble unit trust has long been due an overhaul. The complex system of
bid and offer pricing does not encourage public understanding and is a
fundamental barrier to export. Rigid rules covering fee structures and
investment strategy have put a block on innovation, notwithstanding the
introduction of futures and options funds in 1991. Unsurprisingly, London
has been losing out to easy-going financial centres such as Dublin and
Luxembourg. The Securities and Investments Board deserves credit for trying
to hurry the process of change.
The problem is that many of SIB's proposals carry a cost for unit trust
managers. Single pricing would make it more difficult for them to make
profits by holding units on their own account ready for resale. Charging
investors when money is taken out of trusts  - rather than front-end
charging as the current rules demand  - would squeeze managers' cash flow as
business expands. Big managers usually cover their costs from annual fees
and could stand this strain. Neither are they reliant on own-account profits
to make ends meet. Smaller managers might feel the pinch.
The European Community directive on collective investments should encourage
a sense of urgency. The introduction of continental style open-ended
investment companies is not far off. These vehicles will surely have to
carry a single price, making them saleable from Manchester to Madrid.
Without reform the unit trust might look outmoded by comparison.

FT  22 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Invergordon
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The deal between Fleming Investment Management and Whyte &amp; Mackay may
demonstrate that Chinese walls can operate effectively, but Invergordon's
management will not draw much comfort from that. Having fought off a bid
from Whyte two years ago with the aid of Robert Fleming merchant bank,
Invergordon was always at risk. But for the company's independence to be
carried off by a combination of the oversupply in the whisky market and the
investment performance demands of one of Robert Fleming's close associates
is a hard fate. Presumably it is also mildly embarrassing for Fleming, and
any future explanations of the benefits of integrated houses to potential
clients will make interesting listening.
Still, for all that, the takeover makes sense. Invergordon's strength in
whisky distilling and own label scotch naturally complement Whyte and
Mackay's mid-market brands and bottling capacity. Since Invergordon is a
fairly spare organisation and there is little overlap between the two
companies, rationalisation benefits will be small. But the two combined
should be able to manage a more effective marketing effort than either
singly. Whyte has also timed its intervention well. Over time Invergordon
should prove good value to Whyte, provided it manages its acquisition well.
Given that the bid is effectively decided, it would be in the interests of
the business for Invergordon's directors to use whatever influence they have
left to bring the agony to an end quickly.

FT  22 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Tietmeyer makes his mark
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is tempting, amid the surprise surrounding yesterday's Bundesbank rate
cut, to conclude that something fundamental has changed with the
installation of Mr Hans Tietmeyer as president. To do so might be a mistake.
The discount rate cut was both large and unexpected, but the money market
repurchase rate is being cut by a mere 27 basis points. That suggests a
shift in style rather than substance  - and a wait before the bank is again
moved to cut official lending rates.
Considering the cogent way in which Mr Tietmeyer explained the decision  -
money supply under control, third quarter output flat and inflation looking
good in the last three months  - it is curious that so few pundits had
forecast a cut. One explanation is that Mr Tietmeyer was trying to earn the
markets' respect by surprising them. In this regard he looks more a man of
the world than his predecessor. He may also be more inclined to take the
exchange market into account.
It is not just the pressing doubts about France's ability to hold out
without rate cuts. The Bundesbank cannot be indifferent to pressures on the
Belgian franc, given Luxembourg's threat to sever its connection with that
currency. This would complicate matters for Germany, which has a large
banking presence in the Grand Duchy. Finally, a little encouragement to
other European countries to cut their interest rates might just help boost
flagging demand for German exports. Mr Tietmeyer may be trying to offset
recent D-mark appreciation, but he needs support at home. It will be awkward
if next week's inflation figure, at which even he can presently only guess,
turns out disappointing.

Tough times in Switzerland, where the government's austerity programme is
cutting to the quick, namely into its citizens' allowance for building
nuclear fallout shelters. Through the 1980s, subsidies ran on average at
over SFr100m a year, though they dropped back to SFr90m last year.
The government is not prepared to admit that the need for such shelters has
abated. Rather, it justifies the cutback to a maximum of SFr40m a year with
the observation that shelters now exist for 80 per cent of the 'permanent
resident population'. Something to think about when planning your next trip

The Confederation of British Industry thinks the Accounting Standards Board
is acting too quickly in churning out new financial reporting standards, but
its own criticisms demonstrate anything but nimble footwork.
The arguments might have had a point two years ago, but the ASB has already
changed its ways to extend consultation periods and experiment before making
its standards mandatory, just as the CBI appears to want.
Anyway, the rival Hundred Group of leading finance directors somewhat stole
the CBI's thunder several months ago in calling for greater co-ordination
and phasing of publications. An 'overload group' has already been
established that embraces all the different standard-setting bodies.
Moreover, the CBI is suffering considerable memory lapse. It attacks the ASB
for producing so many standards, yet three years ago it was calling for the
body to tackle many of these very topics.

Inhabitants of Sarajevo are unlikely to mourn the departure of Brigadier

But what will they make of his successor, Brigadier Angus Ramsay? A visitor
to UN headquarters, who ventured a degree of sympathy for the Bosnian
government's position, was astonished to find himself buttonholed by the
brigadier and subjected to a passionate diatribe to the effect that the
newcomer could not possibly understand these people, whereas Ramsay did, and
he knew they had been killing each other for centuries.
Ramsay explained that he grew up in Belgrade, where his father was a

Chris Greig, managing director of Scotch whisky producer Invergordon,
remains cagey about the future now that his company has been all but
swallowed up by Whyte &amp; Mackay. Yesterday worth Pounds 12.6m, at least on
paper, Greig may decide to put his feet up and devote more time to farm
management. But should he tire of such diversions, the 59-year-old may wish
to contemplate the exciting post-retirement life of a former boss.
After gaining his PhD in chemistry from the University of London, Greig's
first job was in the research and development division of the Distillers
Company, working for Magnus Pyke. The mad scientist whose desperate
handwaving earned him the sobriquet of the human windmill was, between 1955
and 1973, in the more sober employ of the Glenochil Research Station in
Clackmannanshire. It was not until turning 67 that the retired food
scientist won the Pye award for the best newcomer to television.

Acts of God having played a fairly significant part in the dismal saga of
Lloyd's, it is appropriate that a brush with the monastic life seems to be
becoming an accepted form of management training for exposure to the
insurance market.
Lloyd's chief executive Peter Middleton came to the market with no knowledge
of insurance, but was equipped no doubt with a certain discipline garnered
from his oft-remarked four years with a French monastic order in Devon.
Among the new vehicles revving on the starting pads after the membership of
Lloyd's insurance market voted in their favour on Wednesday evening is
Corporate Membership. Its managing director, Anthony Hamilton, spent a
summer considering donning the habit at a Franciscan monastery at Cerne
Abbas in Dorset. Middleton admits to not having been a very good monk;
Hamilton says he was after 'broader horizons'.
The latter went on to study comparative religion at Edinburgh University,
somehow convincing the Ministry of Defence to sponsor the endeavour. 'If you
want to understand military strategy, the Old Testament is as good a
starting point as any,' says Hamilton, who spent 10 years in the Grenadier
Guards before setting up in management consultancy.
From there it was but a short step to Number One Lime Street. A Name for
many years, but not one reduced to sack cloth, having cut back his exposure
in the mid-1980s just when the allure of earthly riches seemed brightest,
Hamilton is now taking his begging bowl around personal contacts in his
endeavour to raise Pounds 20m in share capital for his latest venture.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Bundesbank surprises
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK loves surprises. Virtually nobody expected yesterday's cuts
of half a percentage point in the discount and Lombard rates, to 5.75 and
6.25 per cent, respectively. But most will welcome them, not merely in
countries whose currencies are shadowing the D-Mark or, like the Dutch
guilder, closely tied to it, but further afield. Mr Kenneth Clarke can now
lower UK interest rates with greater equanimity.
The easing of German monetary policy since the summer of 1992 has been
substantial: the discount rate has fallen by 3 percentage points, 2 1/2
percentage points in 1993 alone. These latest reductions, which will
presumably be followed by money market rates, also mean that the Bundesbank
is no longer just following the long-term rate of interest down: the
redemption yield on a 10-year government bond is at the low level, by
historical standards, of just under 6 per cent, but the discount rate is
below the bond rate, for the first time since early 1992.
Justifying the latest cuts, the Bundesbank's president, Mr Hans Tietmeyer,
cited the stabilisation in the growth of broad money (M3) at only half a
percentage point above the Bundesbank's ceiling of 6 1/2 per cent. He also
noted that the rise in the consumer price index has been running at an
annualised rate of 2.4 per cent over the latest three months. In addition,
the D-Mark has been strengthening since early summer, against other European
currencies and also against the US dollar.
The Bundesbank is still casting a wary eye on wage settlements and fiscal
policy, but further reductions in interest rates are virtually certain. The
disinflationary pressure in the German economy is substantial, with gross
domestic product and industrial production now 'bumping along the bottom'.
Meanwhile, recessionary conditions in Germany's main markets, the
contractionary fiscal policy and the structural problems of German industry
all mean that there is little, except monetary policy, to facilitate
recovery. Short-term rates of interest may have quite a way to go.
Since stability remains the Bundesbank's watchword, the cuts will be
cautious. But the monetary restraint in its major partners should continue
to ease, even if too slowly to restore the old ERM. The Bundesbank's
behaviour this year strongly suggests that dissolution of that system was an
objective in its own right. The cuts since August could have been justified
earlier, if the Bundesbank had wanted to do so.
Short-term real rates of interest in the European Community are at least
moving towards levels at which recovery is conceivable. Even so, for
countries like France they remain disturbingly high. They will continue to
do so if these countries keep their currencies as close as possible to the
D-Mark. Partly for this reason, recovery in the EC economy is likely to be
slow and weak. That will be painful, even politically dangerous. But, with
existing policies, it is also inevitable.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Personal View: The dangers of capital mobility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILHELM NOLLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The liberalisation of capital controls throughout the industrialised world
is often seen solely as an advantage. However, all-out capital mobility is
very far from being an unalloyed virtue.
Explosive growth in international financial transactions has added sizeably
to the risk of economic instability. Aided by modern technology and growth
in areas like derivatives, these transactions have increased so much in
speed, scope and complexity that they vastly exceed the level of
international trade in goods and services.
Untrammelled capital movements have been an important factor behind the two
crises in the exchange rate mechanism in September 1992 and July-August
1993. More generally, they can give rise to a dangerous political vacuum.
It is no exaggeration to speak of an abdication of democracies in the face
of anonymous, uncontrolled market forces. As Thomas Jefferson said, banks
can be more dangerous than standing armies.
Governments and central banks have a duty to respond to this challenge. The
Maastricht treaty allows countries facing currency disturbances to
reintroduce capital controls as a last resort. Such purely national measures
are unlikely to be effective. However, governments should give thought to
the idea of harmonised international controls to curb the activities of
large-scale 'players' on the markets.
Introducing EC-wide minimum reserves on banks' deposits or borrowings - a
system already in force in Germany - would help control the process of money
creation which often leads to speculative excess. Such a scheme could
possibly be extended to other institutions.
Additionally, a tax on speculative currency movements, suggested recently by
several international economists, could have a stabilising effect. The
advantages far outweigh the technical difficulties and perceived negative
side-effects.
Such a move would make speculators think twice before attacking defensive
walls erected by central banks and elected governments.
These measures could not be effective, however, if individual countries
allowed their financial institutions to evade national or community-wide
restrictions by switching activities to 'safe havens' and other off-shore
centres.
One important reason for considering preventative measures of this sort is
because, when crises arise, the authorities are invariably at a great
disadvantage. Markets react almost instantaneously to events and
perceptions. But official steps to counter financial operators' collective
excesses require time for preparation and co-ordination.
Attempts to pre-empt monetary unrest through international co-operation  -
above all, stability-orientated economic policies, and improved financial
supervision - must be given priority.
I support restoration of the previous narrow exchange rate mechanism bands,
as well as, in due time, the return to the ERM of Britain and Italy.
However, we need to understand that, with the August crisis, a fundamental
change has taken place. EC finance ministers have postponed indefinitely any
return to the narrow bands, while Britain, in particular, looks unlikely to
rejoin the ERM for the foreseeable future. The vision of passing to a single
currency before the end of the century has been replaced by the much more
sober notion of trying to make the new flexible ERM work in a manner which
buttresses non-inflationary growth.
The ERM will still need protection from speculative attacks. To maintain
realistic central rates, we need a somewhat modified application of the
so-called Basle/Nyborg rules agreed in 1987. The main methods for
maintaining currency stability should be intervention and interest rate
measures, with the possibility of realignments held in reserve as a last
resort - for the period after narrow bands have been re-established.
Whether or not we one day have economic and monetary union, Europe, and the
rest of the world, needs more monetary harmonisation. But governments must
also assemble measures to steer the financial community away from anarchy.
Such moves are in the best interests of all nations and, ultimately, of
market participants. They are essential if we are to rebuild the economic
confidence so badly bruised during the past year.

FT  22 OCT 93 / A tall order to avoid the traps: Gatt as well as domestic
economic policies could determine the race to the Elysee Palace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Prime Minister Edouard Balladur pulls off a deal in the stalled General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations that includes at least some
concessions for France, he will probably want - and feel he deserves - to be
the country's next president.
That is a tall order. Such a compromise would require placating all but the
most die-hard of French farmers and appeasing the cultural nationalists in
his own RPR Gaullist party. It would also mightily relieve the
all-too-silent majority of French industrialists and bankers who want wider
markets for their high-tech products and services, and would ward off a
European crisis that would deeply upset his centre-right UDF coalition
partner.
He also faces other potential pitfalls. His chances of winning the
presidency, if he decides to respond to pressure from his supporters to
stand, would depend on pulling France out of recession and formulating a
European policy that can fill a vacuum left by the summer's foreign exchange
upheaval.
Success on Gatt, however, would be a historic step with a conservative
government opening France to the world economy, just as 10 years ago its
socialist leaders decided that France should sign up to the process that led
to the European Community's single market.
Failure of the Uruguay Round on trade liberalisation, if pinned on France,
would, besides damaging world trade, provoke a European political crisis and
almost certainly another European monetary crisis that would destroy
France's hopes of breathing life into the newly ratified Maastricht treaty.
'Gatt is a trap for France,' says Mr Balladur bluntly, though without
admitting that it is largely a trap of his and previous governments' making.
For France to sign a Gatt accord on present terms would be seen as 'a
shameful compromise'. Equally, its failure to sign would be seen as
'dangerously isolating' the country.
So far, Mr Balladur has focused on ensuring that he himself is not
dangerously isolated. This was why he devoted Monday and Tuesday to
explaining his position on Gatt to a stream of leaders of France's
political, business, union, farming, show-business and even academic worlds.
This very public show of consultation to defuse the threat of a crisis was
very much in the style that Mr Balladur learnt when he was Prime Minister
Georges Pompidou's minister in charge of industrial relations in May 1968.
But Mr Balladur's public consultation had other aims. He won public pledges
of support, most importantly from the leader of his own RPR party, Mr
Jacques Chirac, who looks certain to be a candidate in 1995's presidential
elections. But the exercise was also a chance to impress upon France's
movers and shakers the need for some compromise on Gatt.
One man needed no convincing of that. Mr Brice Lalonde, leader of Generation
Ecologie, one faction of the Green movement, has proclaimed his readiness to
campaign in favour of Gatt.
Yet Mr Lalonde, who lost heavily in the March parliamentary elections,
hardly counts. Nor, in this context, does European Commission president
Jacques Delors' recent warning that France is in danger of building itself a
'Maginot line' against Gatt, with about as much utility as that second world
war defence. Most French regard Mr Delors as too implicated in the despised
Blair House accord on farm trade which the Commission negotiated with the
US.
But there are other signs of cracks in France's anti-Gatt consensus that
will be useful to Mr Balladur's search for compromise. Not only are some
media commentators beginning to question the wisdom of France going it alone
on the Gatt; but this week an important fissure appeared in the anti-Gatt
agriculture lobby. The head of France's wine and cognac exporters said 'a
Gatt failure would be a catastrophe' for his members who last year boosted
the country's trade surplus by FFr29bn. French wine exports - largely
unsubsidised and thus unaffected by Blair House constraints - have been hit
by US retaliatory duties in the past, and might be again if Washington took
out a Gatt failure on France. For its part, the Patronat employers'
federation reminded the country that industry and services, which stand to
benefit from a Gatt deal, provide more than 90 per cent of French jobs.
In contrast to his open airing of France's Gatt dilemma, Mr Balladur has
stifled debate on domestic monetary policy, which is as much a trap for him
as the Gatt. On the one hand, he knows that to let the franc slide sharply
against the D-Mark would be to throw away the hard-won credibility France
has earned in the eyes, if not of the markets, at least of Germany. The
strategy of putting every 'letter' of the Maastricht treaty into effect,
hoping that one day its 'spirit' will return, depends, Mr Balladur gauges,
on pretending that the European exchange rate mechanism lives on in shadow
form, at least for France. On the other hand, a drop in interest rates would
guarantee a French recovery in 1994, which for the moment is only made
likely by the government's cautious fiscal policy.
Mr Balladur is still living with his mistake of underestimating the depth of
France's recession, and in cutting spending and raising taxes in April. This
week the government revised its forecast of this year's contraction in the
economy from 0.8 per cent to 1 per cent. Yet, an expansionary budget for
1994 would not have sat well with France's commitment to working out a joint
economic convergence programme with Germany - to be presented for public
relations purposes at next week's EC summit in Brussels. The 1994 budget
will take steps towards shifting welfare charges off company payrolls, on to
general taxation. Long term, this will reduce the cost of French labour,
which should price itself back into the market. But unemployment will
probably go on rising into 1994.
For the moment, Mr Balladur's popularity, though declining from record
levels, is still greater than that of his policies. A large part of the
population still gives him the benefit of the doubt. In spite of much
moaning in private, the Patronat this week backed the 'measured policy of
the government moving towards short-term interest rates of 5-6 per cent', an
expression of hope made more realistic by the Bundesbank's decision
yesterday to cut rates.
Mr Balladur's privatisation programme has helped stoke unrest not only in
Air France, where bitterly contested lay-offs are necessary if the carrier
is ever to be fit for sale, but also indirectly in France Telecom and the
post office which are not on the list of state assets to be sold, but whose
staff fear their utilities will one day be put on the auction block too. But
private investors outnumber public sector workers. Judging by the low price
set for shares in the sale of Banque Nationale de Paris, privatisation is
being conducted so as to put a tidy profit in investors' pockets. That
should make them happy to vote for Mr Balladur in 1995, if he wants to run
for the presidency.
It is hard to see Mr Balladur resisting the lure of the Elysee - but not
because he has any real difficulty with its present incumbent. He gets on
well with President Francois Mitterrand. Too well, some inside the ruling
majority would argue, pointing out that he has let Mr Mitterrand hamper
government attempts to reform school finances and asylum procedures, as well
as the resumption of nuclear weapon testing. But the opinion poll evidence
is conclusive that most French people give Mr Balladur more credit for
falling in with Mr Mitterrand than to Mr Chirac for falling out with the
president when the RPR leader was prime minister in the mid-1980s.
Equally striking is the poll evidence that Mr Balladur would, at the moment,
beat any candidate for the Elysee in 1995, when Mr Mitterrand's term
expires. In spite of consolidating his hold on the depleted Socialist party
at its congress this weekend, Mr Michel Rocard is likely to pose little
challenge to either Mr Chirac or even ex-President Valery Giscard d'Estaing,
leader of the UDF. But opinion surveys show the latter two could be trumped
by a wild-card candidacy of Mr Delors, a centrist socialist.
For the moment, Mr Balladur eschews publicly any presidential ambitions. Nor
has Mr Chirac formally declared his hand. The only visible tension between
the two men is over their disagreement over the timing of the 'real turning
point' in French politics; Mr Balladur claims it came with March's
elections, Mr Chirac says it will not arrive until 1995.
But the issues facing France may soon make the present truce untenable, for
Mr Chirac is closer to the farm lobby on Gatt, more sceptical on Europe, and
more inclined to an expansionary economic policy than Mr Balladur. Failure
by Mr Balladur to finesse Gatt, to orchestrate interest rate cuts and to
bring the jobless rate down next year, would flush Mr Chirac out into open
rivalry.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Managing health
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS ANNOUNCED yesterday to slim down the management of the National Health
Service in England should be seen as a tidying up of unfinished business
rather than a further radical upheaval. Bureaucracy which has become
unnecessary and wasteful following the government's health reforms of 1991
will be swept away. But the reorganisation of the NHS management structure
leaves unresolved the problems of accountability of those who spend the
enormous health budget.
Certainly few will mourn the passing of the 14 regional health authorities,
to be abolished as soon as legislative time can be found. The RHAs are a
hangover from the command structure necessary to administer the health
service before the 1991 reforms. In the new internal market, decisions over
the purchase of health services are devolved, largely to district health
authorities. The hospitals and community health services which provide
treatment are increasingly managed by independent trusts. A regional tier of
management can only attempt to second-guess the decisions of these
purchasers and providers.
Welcome too is the decision to encourage mergers between the district health
authorities and the family health service authorities which administer the
family doctor service. In the health service of the future, the distinction
between the primary care currently provided by family doctors and the
secondary care provided by hospitals will become increasingly irrelevant as
more and more treatment is offered at local health centres. The new
integrated purchasing bodies will be better able to assess local health
needs and buy the most appropriate mix of services to meet those needs.
However, it is regrettable that Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health
secretary, has set her face against turning the NHS into an executive
agency. Agency status would encourage a closer focus on managing the health
service, with clear business targets and less interference from Whitehall.
The reason Mrs Bottomley gives is that an agency would reduce parliamentary
and public accountability. This is a strange argument to offer when the
government has already created more than 80 agencies, all the while denying
any loss of accountability.
It is also rich coming from a government which refuses to address the
problem of local accountability in the new decentralised NHS. The merged
purchasing authorities will between them dispose of a budget of almost
Pounds 30bn, more than half the amount spent by English local authorities.
Yet their boards are made up of Whitehall appointees, with no direct
accountability to the communities they serve. At the very least, they should
be required to work closely with elected local authorities and to consult
them on priorities. It would be better, however, if some of their board
members were elected, either directly or indirectly through nomination of
local authority councillors.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Bosnia still
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ON AUGUST 2 the North Atlantic Council announced that it regarded 'the dire
humanitarian situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and particularly in Sarajevo'
as unacceptable. It decided 'to make immediate preparations for undertaking,
in the event that the strangulation of Sarajevo and other areas continues .
. . stronger measures including air strikes against those responsible'.
Eleven weeks have passed, and the FT's correspondent reports (in Wednesday's
paper): 'Bombarding the city with artillery and mortars as well as targeting
civilian areas with anti-aircraft guns, Serb chieftains, bolstered by their
Croat counterparts and western indifference, are killing whatever spirit
remains in the Bosnian capital.' Sarajevo is still under siege. Most of its
inhabitants are getting half or less of the 600 grammes of food which the UN
regards as minimum daily rations. There is no gas, electricity or running
water, and most families have already burnt their domestic furniture. Cold
is expected to be the biggest killer this winter, yet by last week supplies
of plastic sheeting and other materials for shelter had not begun to arrive.
In other supposedly UN-protected 'safe areas' the situation is even worse.
If this is not 'strangulation' it is hard to imagine what would be. Yet Nato
defence ministers have just been meeting, not to authorise air strikes but
to discuss agreements with former Warsaw Pact members who look (one wonders
why) to the alliance for protection. They did find time to agree to stop
blaming each other for their failure to end the war in Bosnia, and the US
defence secretary promised a 'substantial' contribution to a Nato force that
would be deployed there if a peace agreement is reached. Few of his
colleagues believe Congress would authorise such a deployment, after the
Somalia debacle, but then none of them any longer believes peace will be
reached before the winter.
More to the point was his offer of increased air drops of humanitarian aid.
The priority now must be to help the inhabitants of Sarajevo and other
enclaves to survive. But air drops will not be enough. What is required is
an airlift. In 1948-49 over 2m tons of aid were flown in to Berlin in 10 1/2
months. The blockade of Sarajevo has lasted longer, yet just over 60,000
tons have arrived so far.
The difference lies in the availability of supplies, of transport capacity
and of secure airfields. All three depend on the political will of western
governments. They have the food, they have the aircraft and they have the
capacity to strike back if the Serbs or anyone else attempts to shoot those
aircraft down. Similarly, the smaller enclaves can and should be relieved by
road, if UN troops are ordered to force their way through roadblocks, as
Security Council resolutions already authorise them to do.
It may be too late to save Bosnia. It is not too late  - but it soon will be
 - to save thousands of individual Bosnians.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Attitude to work of young Japanese is
'laziness'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr EIICHIRO TOKUMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As a 29-year-old Japanese salaryman currently staying in London, I read
with great interest the feature on the changing work ethic in my home
country ('More than the job's worth', October 16).
I welcome that Japanese businessmen now feel there is more to life - such as
sense of achievement and satisfaction - than honourable sacrifice in the
service of a big-name company. But not all of them could be labelled
'corporate slaves'. Some were 'corporate fighters' who sincerely and
voluntarily did their best to make their family, company and eventually
country happier. I thank them and am proud of their hard work in the past 45
years which reconstructed war-devastated Japan, with few natural resources,
as a major economic power.
I share the concern of Mr Kusamitsu, of Tokyo University, that Japan's
corporate strength, partly built on the devotion of my father's generation,
might be weakened due to the new work ethic. What irritates me is that,
recently, it seems trendy among the younger generation in Japan to have less
aspiration for a career and more inclination for hobbies. Some even say hard
work is out of fashion now.
This does not, as they claim, have anything to do with creativity or
fairness: it is just laziness. They should not have less ambition for a job
at a time of deep recession, but should aspire more to worthwhile jobs, to
which they can show commitment. Eiichiro Tokumoto,

FT  22 OCT 93 / Racists' protective blanket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Here is a news item: 'German thugs stab Turk at petrol station, jeer his
German girlfriend'. Here is another: 'Gang of nine Germans, one a girl,
savagely beats 17-year-old Turkish boy, leave him for dead'. Here is a
third: 'Turkish child, 15, stabbed to death by neo-Nazis at Hamburg bus
stop'.
The lesson is clear. You cannot trust the Germans. They always revert to
type. Oh yes? The above headlines have all been doctored. The attacks they
describe did take place, but not in Germany, and not on Turks. The
perpetrators were British, the victims black and Asian British youngsters.
The natural German response to such events in their own country is a
resurgence of angst; the natural British reaction is to snuggle down under a
blanket of complacency. After all, they - the Germans - are the known
racists. Who won the war? We - the British - are the most humane and liberal
of the earth's peoples.
Phooey. The number of racial 'incidents' reported to the police - the
British police - rose from 4,383 in 1988 to 7,793 last year. The actual
number is far higher. Many blacks and Asians are too sceptical, or too
afraid, to make an official complaint. Responses to the British Crime Survey
suggest that there are now 140,000 racial attacks a year in England and
Wales alone. It does not matter that some or many of these may have been
'minor'; the point is that their cumulative effect is to make certain
neighbourhoods unsafe for a segment of the population. A few are unsafe in
the extreme. There were 10 racial murders in Britain last year, putting us
second in Europe after Germany. Some interpretations of the statistics put
the home of liberal democracy first.
Britain's complacency is partly explained by electoral behaviour.
Continental Europeans are more likely to vote for openly xenophobic parties
than are their offshore cousins. In one German state, Hesse, the Republican
vote in March was 7.9 per cent. In France Mr Le Pen's candidates attracted
12 per cent in the first-round vote of the March election. The recent
victory of the British National party in a council by-election in a deprived
inner-city area is meaningless set against such figures. A more appropriate
comparison is with the April 1992 general election. The average BNP vote in
the dozen or so constituencies it contested was 1.2 per cent; as a share of
national votes cast its score was 0.02 per cent. Psephologically speaking,
this is Monster Raving Loony party territory.
The explanation for the apparent sophistication of Britain's voters is
well-known. The main parties have a tacit understanding with the electorate.
They will eliminate non-white immigration, by supporting laws that reduce it
to the barest minimum that humane treatment of family connections will
allow. Race relations legislation is in place to protect the British-born
ex-immigrant population. In return, voters abstain from supporting openly
racist parties.
What is not so clear is the connection between the presence of the BNP
office in Welling, south London, and the rise in the number of serious
racial assaults and murders in the surrounding area. What is even murkier is
what is to be done if there is a provable connection. Angry - scared -
blacks and Asians who marched towards Welling last weekend want the racist
party closed down. That is not the British way. It is, rather, to allow the
BNP to speak and campaign, and to prosecute anybody who assaults anyone.
This is probably not good enough. Much depends on how hard the police try to
protect non-white citizens. 'Racial attacks will not be tolerated,' said Mr
Michael Howard, the home secretary, in his celebrated leading-from-the-right
speech to the Conservative party conference in Blackpool on October 6. I
wish I could say that the Conservatives cheered, stamped their feet, clapped
and whistled. They did not. 'We are all, rightly, dismayed at events such as
the recent sickening attacks on young Asian and black men,' Mr Howard told
the Jewish welfare organisation B'Nai Brith last week. He also deplored 'the
election to a local council of a candidate whose very policies are an
affront to the overwhelming majority of the British public'.
Mr Howard must be given credit when it is his due. He gets plenty of stick
when it is not. Strong signals from leading politicians should be part of an
effort to isolate the skinheads. But if words alone could limit the threat
of racial attacks, the home secretary's statements would be the end of the
story. We must hope that Mr Howard is thinking of more than declarations of
outrage. He is due to visit Tower Hamlets, the scene of many racist crimes,
this morning. His purpose is 'fact finding', to establish whether the
'community relations' policies he praised in his B'Nai Brith speech need
improvement.
They do. Local committees are being established, under the guidance of an
interdepartmental Racial Attacks Group, chaired by the Home Office. We need
more of them, with strengthened powers and sufficient resources. More
targeted policing would help. This should reduce attacks and, as experiments
in key boroughs have shown, the number of thugs caught - the 'clear-up rate'
 -increases dramatically when a small police team is dedicated to the job.
Many Asians and Afro-Carribeans want new offences of racial violence and
harassment to be created. The Commission for Racial Equality, the Jewish
Board of Deputies, and the Anti-Racist Alliance support this. I would like
to, but remain puzzled. Mr Howard says that existing law deals with violent
assaults, while the Public Order Act prohibits conduct intended or likely to
stir up racial hatred. To require proof of racial motivation in addition to
proof of assault might make convictions more difficult. Put that way, yes -
but the police could get assault convictions on ordinary grounds. Judges
could take racial motivation into account in determining sentence. This
might deter some skinheads. Against that, certainty of conviction is a
greater deterrent than length of sentence.
These are fine, arguable, details. What is beyond question is the need to
place the protection of black and brown British subjects higher on the
government's list of priorities. Telling ourselves we are not Germans will
no longer suffice. I'd like to think that Mr Howard is aware of that.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Back from the abyss: The revival of confidence in Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The morning after the night before, the mood at Lloyd's was better yesterday
than could have been expected when work began earlier this year on rules to
allow corporate investors into the insurance market for the first time.
Wednesday's landslide vote by Lloyd's Names, the individuals whose assets
have traditionally supported underwriting, in favour of the rule change
signalled a fundamental shift by the 300-year-old market.
Blue-chip banks and securities houses now plan to launch at least 16 new
Lloyd's investment trusts, with the aim of raising more than Pounds 1bn from
institutional and retail investors. The money will be invested in equities
and gilts, but also used to back Lloyd's syndicates. Though the appetite of
investors might not be as great as some corporate financiers hope, Lloyd's
can expect to raise at least Pounds 500m.
The decline in Lloyd's capital base, which seemed inexorable only 12 months
ago, has been halted. Next year, capacity - the amount of business that can
be accepted for a given amount of capital - should rise above Pounds 9bn,
compared with Pounds 8.7bn currently. Heavy losses are expected when, over
the next two years, results are published for 1991 and 1992, but confidence
is returning: insurance rates are rising steeply in most sectors.
For instance, Mr John Charman, underwriter of one of the market's biggest
marine syndicates, says his rates have increased sharply this year. 'After
many years of famine, Lloyd's is producing very strong underwriting
profits,' he told Wednesday's extraordinary general meeting.
Mr David Rowland, Lloyd's chairman, and Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive,
know, however, that excessive euphoria would be misplaced.
Still to be implemented is an ambitious plan announced in April to transfer
billions of pounds of potential asbestosis and pollution claims into a new
reinsurance company, with the aim of 'ring fencing' the liabilities to
protect new investors.
They have also promised to reach an out-of-court settlement with thousands
of loss-making Names whose legal actions are still outstanding. Failure
would mean years of litigation.
On both these counts, however, the market's prospects are brighter than Mr
Rowland and Mr Middleton would have thought possible a year ago. Corporate
investors recognise that totally ring fencing the old US asbestosis and
pollution claims may prove difficult, but are prepared to accept this as a
commercial risk. During the summer Sir Laurie Magnus, who has led work on a
Lloyd's investment trust launched by Samuel Montagu, the merchant banker,
was worried about the uncertainties. But now he is more pragmatic: 'We're
not worried now. There is a risk but we have to take a commercial judgment.'
Mr Michael Hesketh, a director at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, has been
reassuring potential investors in CLM Insurance Fund, which BZW is
sponsoring. He says the risks they face at Lloyd's from US pollution and
asbestosis claims are no greater than those involved in buying shares in
some UK and US insurance companies, which are exposed to many of the same
claims.
At the same time, the scale of Wednesday's vote in favour of Lloyd's plans
on corporate membership demonstrates that dissident loss-making Names do not
have enough support to dent confidence in the market.
Mr Michael Deeny, the chairman of the Gooda Walker Names Action Group, the
biggest group of loss-making Names, is sceptical about the chances of an
out-of-court deal and is still intent on 'suing the pants off Lloyd's'. But
he acknowledges that Mr Rowland and Mr Middleton have won the confidence of
many Names.
There are also reasons for Lloyd's to be optimistic that the problems of the
last five years, when losses totalled more than Pounds 6bn, will not recur.
Corporate members and individual Names, who continue to underwrite without
any limit on their potential losses, are beginning to diversify risks by
making smaller commitments to more syndicates.
Four out of five members' agents - which handle the affairs of individual
Names - next year plan to introduce Members' Agents Pooling Arrangements,
which will spread the commitments of Names more widely. Financial
Intelligence &amp; Research, a consultancy monitoring Lloyd's syndicates,
expects Mapas to supply Pounds 5.2bn in capacity in 1994, more than half the
market total.
Corporate investors are also more likely than individual Names to make
greater demands on agents and syndicates, reinforcing moves towards greater
professionalism in the market. Mr Chris Hitchings, analyst with UBS Global
Research, says: 'Corporate investors are not brighter than Names, but they
are managing other people's money and this does require them to undertake a
basic exercise in screening investments for those whose demise would be
indefensibly embarrassing.'
Yet some pessimists see new problems arising out of this week's successes.
Over the past 18 months, with much of the market short of capital, it has
been relatively easy to press the case for cost-cutting and greater
professionalism. But the expected inflow of capital could make it harder to
persuade underwriters to accept lower salaries or conform to quality
standards.
Worse still, with capital abundant, some underwriters may be tempted to
reduce their rates to win business, raising the spectre of the fierce rate
wars that proved so damaging in the late 1980s.
Agents who manage syndicates say that already they are unable to accommodate
all the potential interest of corporate investors. 'There is now a large
excess of supply of capital over demand,' says Mr Paul Archard, of the
Murray Lawrence agency.
Mr Robert Hiscox, deputy chairman of the market who oversaw plans to bring
the corporate capital to the market, agrees that some attitudes have begun
to change. 'The cockiness is back. A few arrogant underwriters are slipping
back into their old habits.' Some underwriters tell him they intend to
increase their charges for corporate members, says Mr Hiscox. 'I tell them:
'The lifeboat has just come in and you want to charge it to land?' '
Lloyd's had already taken some steps to prevent a repetition of its
mistakes, unveiling contingency plans in April to limit, if necessary, the
amount of corporate capital that would be allowed to enter the market. At
the time, there was little expectation that such a mechanism would be
needed.
If too much capital is attracted for the market to absorb, however, Mr
Rowland may have to invoke such powers - or the revival in confidence may
foreshadow an unpleasant hangover at a later date for Lloyd's.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Managed trade an 'assault' on system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof GARY R SAXONHOUSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As a long-time student of the Japanese economy and a signer of the
recent open letter sent by American economists to President Clinton and
Prime Minister Hosokawa denouncing managed trade ('US economists attack
'myopic' trade calls', October 7), I was surprised to find C Fred Bergsten
arguing in his letter (October 15) that his views on Japanese trade barriers
had not changed over the past decade. That Mr Bergsten found Japan had trade
barriers in the mid-1980s is hardly the issue. No one believes Japan has no
trade barriers more than any serious observer believes the US or the
European Community has no trade barriers.
The real issue is whether Japanese barriers are so distinctive that resort
to what Mr Bergsten calls 'unorthodox policy responses' like voluntary
import expansions (VIEs) are necessary. On this there con be no debate about
the change in Mr Bergsten's position. In the 1985 study cited in his letter,
Mr Bergsten, and his colleague William Cline, found that '. . . Japan shows
no special aberration of low imports that might be attributable to high but
intangible protection, after taking account of country size, natural
resource endowment and transportation costs. And although the share of
Japanese manufactures in Japan's total imports is low, there are sound
reasons of comparative advantage to expect this pattern'.
Given the high regard in which he is held in policy circles throughout the
world, Mr Bergsten should explain why he has changed his views, rather than
strive unnecessarily for consistency. Unhappily, Mr Bergsten's recent book,
Reconcilable Differences, goes so far as to neglect the research done at the
Institute of International Economics by him and his colleagues which
supports his earlier views. By neglecting such work, Mr Bergsten's new book
gives the impression that his new views regarding trade barriers are
supported by the majority of careful studies of this issue. This is not the
case at all.
Rather than changing his original views on Japanese trade barriers, Mr
Bergsten would be better off revising his views on VIEs. Despite instruction
from Professor Bhagwati's letter (August 23), Mr Bergsten still fails to
grasp the analytical equivalence between VIEs and voluntary export
restraints (VERs). In both cases, Japanese sales are being restrained. VIEs
restrain Japanese sales in the home market. VERs restrain Japanese sales in
an overseas market.
In flat contradiction to what Mr Bergsten alleges, there is nothing in
economics suggesting that when a home market is vacated, there will be more
competition than when an overseas market is vacated. Indeed, under any
reasonable assumptions about economic behaviour, VIEs, like VERs, will
result in less competition and higher prices. Whether Republican (VERs) or
Democratic (VIEs), managed trade is an assault on the international economic
system as we know it.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: BT should not be allowed to carry
entertainment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr E P O MERCER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I can but applaud the stance taken in your leader, 'Multi-media
superhighways' (October 15), prompted by the proposed merger of TCI and Bell
Atlantic. I only wish that your newspaper applied the same principles to its
analysis of UK telecommunications competition. If you did, I submit you
would not have voiced support in the past for BT being able to carry
Video-on-Demand (VOD) services. That is the UK equivalent of permitting the
US Baby-Bells to link up with cable companies operating in their own area,
which you rightly say would not lead to increased competition.
We are not in the US position of having two sets of strong local providers,
each migrating into the other's business. Allowing BT to provide VOD is the
equivalent of a Baby-Bell acquiring the cable systems in its own backyard.
You would allow it the chance to use its power to dominate vision
distribution as well as voice, and enhance its ability to prevent
alternative networks from being built.
If one wants to encourage (or at least not discourage) competition in the
provision of local loop services in the UK, I suggest that one has to
restrict BT from carrying all entertainment services until the second
networks provided by cable operators have grown to a sufficient strength and
size.
It was thought the government had realised this and that the policy in its
1991 white paper was to prevent BT from conveying entertainment services and
providing them until at the least 1998 and 2001 respectively. The effect of
permitting VOD services to be provided by means of the BT main network,
outside the framework in which the delivery of other entertainment services
is regulated, cannot be helpful for the eventual goal of creating
voice/vision competition in the local loop for the ultimate benefit of
business and residential customers in the UK.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Charge cards also cost dear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr BIMAL PRODHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report, 'Paying with cash costs UK consumers Pounds 800m a year'
(October 18), should have read 'paying with cash costs UK banking sector
(not UK consumers) dearly'. Any notion of cost is the difference between two
alternatives, here being the use of cards instead of cash. Paying with cards
would be beneficial to the banks by increasing annual membership income,
charging retailers 4 per cent or more on sales revenues (ultimately paid by
consumers), and tempting consumers to spend more by getting into debt.
Perhaps there ought to be a study of how much charge cards cost UK consumers
every year.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Inevitability of pit closures and tax
rises on oil and gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JAMES S COBBETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In a letter published in the FT on March 31 I bemoaned the unequal
treatment given to oil and gas exploration and production and the coal
industry. At that time, in order to appease public opposition to pit
closures, Pounds 400m of taxpayers' money had been given to British Coal, in
a move said to 'provide dramatic opportunities', while taxes on North Sea
production were being increased to prevent 'subsidising sub-optimal
investment'.
How inevitable, six months later, that government sources are now suggesting
that not one of the pits at risk may be saved.
How equally inevitable that increased taxes on oil and gas, albeit to
consumers, are now being mooted to help the government out its present
difficulties, which continue to be made worse by throwing cash down holes in
the ground with no economically recoverable coal in them.
Plus ca change.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Arts: The Way of the World
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALANNAH HOPKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the Dublin Theatre Festival the Rough Magic theatre company produced
Congreve's The Way of the World, which has not been seen here since 1932.
Perhaps the reason for its long absence is that this is not a light, frothy
comedy, but a serious moral one whose convoluted plot demands close
attention from the audience.
Director Lynne Parker has taken an inspired gamble by setting the play in
the 1930s, a period which is brilliantly suited to Congreve's cynical cast
of characters. It is played in the round on a set (by Blaithin Sheerin, who
also designed the costumes) which consists of a stark steel and smoked glass
cocktail bar. The women wear slinky long dresses while the men appear in
various permutations of white tie and evening dress.
However, it is still hard work to follow the double crossings and
dissimulations. Basically, it concerns Mirabell's efforts to convince Lady
Wishfort to allow him to marry her niece, Millamant. It is complicated by
the marital infidelities of the Fainalls, in which Mrs Marwood is involved,
and the arrival in town of Lady Wishfort's nephew Sir Wilful Witwoud. Most
people will sympathise with Sir Wilful's half-brother Witwoud when he says,
towards the end of the long protracted denouement, 'Egad I understand
nothing of the matter; I'm in a maze yet, like a dog in a dancing school.'
One of the most striking features of the 1930s setting is the uncanny way
that Congreve's words, written in 1700, sound so appropriate from the lips
of these chain-smoking lounge lizards. The characters' affected, world-weary
attitudes travel remarkably well across the centuries, and Congreve's words
are brought newly alive.
Among a hard-working cast of 13, Darragh Kelly's Witwoud is especially
appealing, raising laughs where one would not necessarily expect them.
Barbara Brennan plays the aged and domineering Lady Wishfort with such
subtlety that she seems more pathetic than ridiculous. Andrea Irvine's
Millamant is a lively black-haired beauty, and it is easy to see why
Mirabell is so enthralled. I thought that Peter Hanly's Mirabell was too
young and foppish to carry the moral weight of the part, but he came good in
the last act. Martin Murphy, a large fresh-faced man, was perfectly cast as
the country cousin, Sir Wilful Witwoud, and Mal Whyte apparently making his
stage debut as Waitwell, the servant who is disguised to woo Lady Wishfort
and make a fool of her, has a natural comic gift.
Lynne Parker directs the proceedings at a fast and well-sustained pace, and
as far as I could tell not a word has been cut. She also makes some good
visual jokes with the unusual set, for example, posing Millamant beside a
pillar to which the white lily has been tied, and using the actors'
cigarette smoke to symbolise their dissemblance.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Arts: Beguiling Coppelia from LCB - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London City Ballet is back in business - and in more senses than one, thanks
to renewed commercial support. After a decade of gallant, and gallantly
independent, existence, financial uncertainty forced the company to close
this summer for want of serious government subvention. The Arts Council, to
whom every lame post-modern duck is a swan, chose to ignore the merits of an
ensemble which played 200 performances a year of decent classic stagings to
a devoted public. (Perhaps these audiences were not small enough. Perhaps
the repertory was not sterile and self-indulgent enough to warrant funding).
Sponsorship was the lifeline that sustained the troupe until this July.
Honourable closure ensued.
Then ADT, the Texaco Endowment, Prospect Charitable Trust and the Sander
Gorlinsky Trust, came to the rescue - and how welcome their support. LCB has
been revived, and is embarked upon its autumn round of performances with a
new and excellent staging of Coppelia. I saw the production at the Churchill
Theatre in Bromley on Wednesday. Cecilia Barrett has mounted the hallowed
old Russian text (by Petipa and Cecchetti) for the first and third acts; the
second is given in Jack Carter's sensitive edition.
The result, with Peter Farmer's pretty designs (made some years ago for
LCB), is a beguiling, splendidly honest version of the dear old ballet. The
narrative is uncomplicated and alert; the dances are infectiously happy,
touched with true gaiety of spirit.
I know that I have been watching Coppelia since the dawn of time: a
presentation as light-hearted and responsible as this - with dancers who are
clearly enjoying what they do and are eager to share that enjoyment with
their public - makes this ancient charmer still the freshest and best of
experiences in the dance theatre. Though LCB can only provide 18 musicians,
Delibes' golden score loses none of its power to inspire the action under
Daryl Griffith. It sparkled as it should, and a lady seated near me could
not resist humming along with its melodies: that it can give such pleasure
is part of its magic.
The cast was led by Jane Sanig as a vividly happy Swanilda - her
characterisation is quick-witted, quick-footed - and by Marius Els, an
assured Franz who is also an excellent partner. Terry Hayworth was a jolly
Coppelius, yet responsive to the darker moments of the second act; the
ensembles were as lively and buoyant as one could wish. It was a delightful
performance, rewarding to both dancers and public. LCB must not be placed in
jeopardy again.
London City Ballet tours Coppelia and a good triple bill this autumn to
Swansea (week of Nov. 1); High Wycombe (Nov 8); Croydon (Nov 15); Brighton
(Nov 22). Sponsorship is provided by ADT, Texaco, The Prospect Charitable
Trust, The Sander Gorlinsky Trust.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Arts: Bawden's Days of the Hawk - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not enough people notice the BBC Symphony's season of concerts in the Maida
Vale Studios. They are thoroughly prepared and recorded for future
broadcasts, but free to their live audiences (you need only apply to the
Radio Ticket Unit). Much of what they offer is out-of-the-way, in one way or
another, or often brand new. On Wednesday, for example, we had 35-year-old
Rupert Bawden conducting the premieres of two of his own choral works,
flanked by Bartok pieces and with Berio's Chemins III in the middle.
The choice of the Chemins  - a mini-concerto for viola, Berio's second
expansion of his Sequenza for viola alone  - may have been prompted by
Bawden's being a violist himself. (He used to be a familiar face among the
strings in various modernist ensembles.) This was the first time I had heard
him conduct. His excellent soloist scrubbed and buzzed away as her part
requires, but the multi-levelled orchestral commentary, sprouting off in all
directions from the central role, sounded opaque, too much of a muchness.
Four of Bartok's choral folksong arrangements, beautiful but technically
difficult, were delivered cleanly by the BBC Singers. In the same composer's
Dance Suite, Bawden secured the right pungent, vociferous instrumental
colours, but only a modicum of its rhythmic drive. As also in the Folksongs,
there was too little electricity to carry across the sudden pauses and
suspensions. (His 'body language', as they say, looks stiff still, and my
companion remarked upon his unfocussed up-beat.)
It may be that in other hands, Bawden's new The Days of the Hawk  - a BBC
commission  - would reveal a more urgent, forward-leaning profile than it
showed here. At 22 minutes long, it needed that; and yet it had other
virtues that made their mark. The basis of the piece is a poetic rhapsody
on, or after, a fraught episode from an Arab epic (narrated over the initial
music). Against a background of orchestral whispers, deep-struck basses,
solo phrases like the cries of birds, the chorus intones the text with quiet
fervour. Mostly in close-knit lines and regular, even notes: the effect is
more of incantation than of dramatic expression.
The atmosphere is consistently sustained, and palpably, tantalisingly
'exotic' in a way that echoes, say, early Roussel or Florent Schmitt. In the
absence of any sharply defined development, however  - as far as one could
hear  - the piece began to seem becalmed midway through, the choral part too
mild and steady to register much more than modest peaks of intensity. I
imagine that more was intended.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Arts: Hedda Gabler - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hedda Gabler reached London in 1891 via Munich, Helsinki, Berlin, Stockholm,
Copenhagen and Gothenburg. The Munich opening was a flop, but Ibsen
shrugged: 'The public likes to laugh.' There is awkward laughter at the end
of Hedda at the Manchester Royal Exchange, a sign that the production still
lacks focus and seriousness.
Henrik Ibsen (1828-1906) is the most domestic of playwrights, closest to
Chekhov, but without his expansive melancholy and without the calm centre
which every Chekhov play has. At the centre of Ibsen lies the dramatic
version of Soren Kierkegaard, even if he claims to have read little of the
philosopher. But all Ibsen comes down to this: 'What is healthy is the
happiness one acquires through one's own will.' This is as true of Nora in
The Doll's House as of Hedda.
Hedda's suicide should be the end of expectation and the end of the play. At
Manchester, the direction (Joseph Blatchley) is too frenetic and flighty to
allow the issues, let alone the characters, to settle. Keeping actors on the
move in the all-round auditorium at Manchester dispels the claustrophobia of
Ibsen's play and makes Hedda's suicide into a random event rather than the
outcome of her circumstances.
Geraldine James as Hedda gradually bends her imperiousness to her
surroundings ('I suppose a butler is out of the question'), and sets about
manipulating her pliant husband, Jorgen. Ibsen writes short speeches, always
clear about the distribution of power in each exchange. These are adult
conversations. Hedda: 'Did you enjoy yourself?' Jorgen: 'Were you worried
about me?' Hedda: 'No, I asked whether you enjoyed yourself.'
James plays Hedda at full throttle, never finding quiet, never concentrating
the action. Her best scenes are with Dave Hill as Judge Brack, who locates a
tone of level menace, and who does keep still on stage. Alongside her,
Phillip Joseph is far too ineffectual as Jorgen, the stupid, soppy academic
specialising in 'The cottage industries in the Brabant in the Middle Ages';
he marries Hedda and falls short of her demands; it is, admittedly, a hard
part, for Joseph has to represent feebleness without being feeble.
Hilton McRae as Eilert Lovberg, Hedda's former suitor and Jorgen's present
rival, fails to find the necessary charisma. The whole production should be
more like Middlemarch and he should be just like Will Ladislaw. The weak
women, well played by Marlene Sidaway (Jorgen's aunt) and Cecily Hobbs
(Lovberg's devotee) balance the excesses of Hedda's behaviour and James's
acting.
The production needs to find pitch and purpose. Ibsen is a strong willed
writer and requires tough treatment from the director. There is director's
wisdom in Ibsen's remark to a friend: 'It always strikes me as comical when
people tell me that something they wanted did not work out. They have merely
desired or longed for something, not willed it.'
Royal Exchange, Manchester (061 833 9833) until November 13

Public Eye: Cautionary Tales (BBC2, 8.00). The policy of cautioning
criminals for so-called minor offences, intended to stop reoffending, comes
under investigation. Is it right that 20-year-old Matt, having been
cautioned no fewer than 11 times, can break another man's jaw and not be
prosecuted?
Tonight is something of an event for gardeners, the first programme of a new
and genuinely different kind of gardening series, Plant Life (C4, 9.00).
It is perfectly possible to be a skilful gardener without understanding why
clay soil is sticky let alone having a clue about photosynthesis.
Yet many enthusiastic gardeners would probably do the outdoor jobs better
and possibly enjoy the gardening much more if they had a basic knowledge of
plant physiology and a clearer understanding of the relationship between the
plants and their environment.
Animated Arias: From Opera Imaginaire (BBC2, 9.50). The programmes have been
very different but also quite intriguing.
Tonight the treatment is applied to arias from Gounod's Faust and Puccini's
Tosca.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Arts: Delightful Precipice - Jazz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'We know our Freddie Keppard backwards, but we are not part of the
retro-movement yet' said Django Bates breathlessly, two thirds of the way
through the crazy funfair that is the Delightful Precipice. The shipping
forecast tape which played to the filling auditorium had already warned of
the gales to come and when the 18 pieces which make up the jazz orchestra
filed in, the atmosphere in the QEH was like that of the end of term
concert.
Yes, jazz is fun again] For Bates, one of many Loose Tube luminaries in the
1980s, it always has been and with the new band (which features other Tube
people), and a new record deal, he keeps the eccentric faith.
The combination of conventional orchestration in reeds and brass with
piccolos, kazoos and what looked like Northumbrian pipes behind Bates's own
ricocheting and sometimes random keyboard technique creates a heaving,
seemingly steam driven mass of sound.
The writing, mostly Bates's own and sometimes drawn from the Loose Tubes'
book, describes a peculiarly British scene of obsession and off-kilter
observation. Fans of Ivor Cutler, Viv Stanshall, the seaside and the sixth
form should find a welcome in numbers such as 'Armchair March', 'Queen of
Puddings' and 'The Loneliness of Being Right'.
Earnest followers of the stern young men who make up what Bates describes as
the retro-movement should give Delightful Precipice a wide berth, however.
Featured soloists such as Iain Bellamy (saxes), Julian Arguelles (baritone
sax) and Eddie Parker (flutes) know the rules but choose to bend them, egged
on by Bates's mad professor direction which involved him whirling from his
stool, peck horn in hand to gurn horribly at the brass section.
Less swinging than the Tubes, perhaps, the Precipice is similarly bursting
with ideas which are juxtaposed at crazy angles to keep the listener off
balance. And although some of his musical gags may cause the odd wince, as
an antidote to the unsmiling keepers of the tradition, Bates is becoming an
indispensable part of the jazz scenery.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Arts: Lorenzo in London / Review of the Renaissance
exhibition at the Accademia Italiana
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A great patron can only exist at a time and in a place where great art is to
be found. Last year Florence spared no expense in commemorating the fifth
centenary of the death of one of its most illustrious sons. No fewer than
nine exhibitions were devoted to the art and culture of the age of Lorenzo
the Magnificent. It may be that a tireless visitor would have come away with
a more profound understanding of the relationship between the man and his
time, but it seems more likely that he would have been unable to see the
wood for the trees.
Now the Accademia Italiana in London offers a kind of digest of the
Florentine shows in a single exhibition. It was a bold undertaking, not
least in a venue outside Italy (Italian museums are renowned for their
reluctance to lend works of art) and one as essentially domestic in scale as
the Accademia.
The catalogue  - despite the lamentable translation  - is very illuminating
about Laurentian architecture and Lorenzo as a patron and collector, the
political and religious life of late 15th century Florence, its spectacular
public entertainments and the workshop system of its artists and craftsmen.
Those who do not invest in it (Pounds 18) will find a quite different show.
Its strength lies in the power of the exhibits to bring to life not so much
Lorenzo as some aspect of the vanished world of Renaissance Florence. That
object might be a richly gilded ceremonial helmet topped by a predatory
eagle from the vast workshop of Antonio del Pollaiolo; a noble 2nd century
AD bronze head of a horse from the Medici collection beside the much smaller
contemporary version it no doubt inspired; or a humble patchwork cushion.
Perhaps such juxtapositions explain exhibition designer Maurizio di Puolo's
brutalist chipboard and gold leaf.
Exceptional works of art are to be found. Particular treats include a
miniature Crucifixion by Fra Angelico and Fra Bartolomeo's exquisite
grisaille panels from the tabernacle of Pietro del Pugliese. From San
Gimignano comes a bust of an obscure local saint, Santa Fina, by Pietro
Torregiano. Demonised by posterity as the teenage lout who broke
Michelangelo's nose, or at least as the author of Henry VII's tomb in
Westminster Abbey, he reveals himself here capable of extraordinary feats of
delicacy. As if in a gesture of deliberate ostentation, the sculpture is
carved out of fine marble and then painted.
The least important works of art are often the most telling, not least the
anonymous, meticulously detailed account of Savonarola's execution at the
stake. This piece of reportage is made all the more chilling for its
wide-eyed naivety  - and also because the Piazza della Signoria has changed
so little since then.
Inevitably the Renaissance is thought of in terms of 'high' art and of an
unbroken succession of masterpieces. One of the show's most refreshing
features is that it continually challenges these misconceptions. Laurentian
Florence not only produced such high-minded and princely objects as the
masterly small bronze Hercules on Horseback by Bertoldo di Giovanni, the
mentor of Michelangelo, but the primitive but no less compelling 'Madonna
del Soccorso' which belongs more to the folk tradition of the peasant
ex-voto. The Virgin appears larger than life and brandishing a knobbly club
with which to ward off a bearded scarlet monster of a devil. He can snarl as
much as he pleases but the child will be able to return to the safe embrace
of his praying mother.
Lorenzo is powerfully present in the sequence of lavishly mounted hardstone
cups and vases, and in the manuscripts. Fashioned out of rock-crystal,
sardonyx, cornelian and amethyst, the former blazon his name, the letters
LAV. R MED cut into their very surface. Such gems, ancient and modern, were
Lorenzo's passion. It is revealing that his prized Farnese Cup, perhaps the
most impressive of all antique cameos, was valued at 10,000 florins. A mere
Botticelli was worth around 100. As far as we know, he never cared to buy
one.
Medici emblems and those of the man himself  - the laurel wreath being the
most obvious  - sumptuously embellish the manuscripts that he acquired or
commissioned to supplement the already extensive family library. The
creation of the Laurentian Library at San Lorenzo was to absorb much of
Lorenzo's energies and finances during his later years. His was the last
great manuscript collection of the Renaissance, amassed at a time when the
invention of printing had already sounded their death-knell.
Renaissance Florence: The Age of Lorenzo de' Medici 1449-1492, sponsored by
the American Express Foundation, continues until January 23, 1994 at the
Accademia Italiana, 24 Rutland Gate, SW7.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Technology: On the road to the future - Audi and Alcoa have
developed a saloon car with a light aluminium body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
With the start this month of commercial production at the world's first
plant for volume production of aluminium body structures, Audi and Aluminum
Company of America have started to take car manufacturing into new
territory.
Alcoa has invested DM120m (Pounds 49m) in the plant at Soest in Germany's
North Rhine-Westphalia region. From there, body parts will be sent to the
Audi car plant further south in Ingolstadt, Bavaria.
They will form part of the new luxury Audi ASF (aluminium space frame)
saloon, of which the company hopes to sell 15,000 a year after the launch at
next spring's Geneva motor show. The components of the ASF will be assembled
into the skeleton-like aluminium 'space frame', around which a skin of
aluminium body panels will then be pressed and attached.
Alcoa should then begin to obtain a clearer idea of how much potential
exists among other manufacturers for a car construction concept offering
substantial weight savings over steel, and thus better fuel consumption and
reduced exhaust emissions, but at much higher material cost.
Since the new top-range saloon is expected to be only the first of a range
of aluminium models from Audi, the up-market subsidiary of the Volkswagen
group, Alcoa has planned an eventual annual capacity of 100,000 structures a
year at Soest.
Eric Winter, manager for automotive products at Alcoa's technical centre in
Pennsylvania, says Alcoa is talking to 'a number of automakers' about
similar projects in Europe and North America.
However, there are no firm commitments yet from other car companies to adopt
the aluminium technology and processes developed jointly by Audi and Alcoa
over the past 10 years at a cost of DM1.1bn.
Other large manufacturers have exploratory programmes under way  - Ford of
the US, for example, through a technology partnership with Canada's Alcan
group  - but appear reluctant to commit themselves as extensively as Audi.
Ford and Alcan have built a small fleet of aluminium-bodied prototype cars.
However, senior executives at Ford's research centre near Cologne believe
Ford is more likely to use aluminium for some body panels, such as bootlids
and bonnets, and a broader spread of mechanical components than seek to
build aluminium-bodied cars in large volumes.
The Audi/Alcoa process is said to be viable for production runs of up to
100,000 cars a year, not enough for cars such as Volkswagen's popular Golf
model or similar cars built at the rate of 200,000 or more units a year in
some plants.
The partners are looking at ways of meeting these volume requirements
however, in the belief that in the long term, aluminium's attractions of
reduced weight, 50 per cent lower tooling costs compared with steel and
almost infinite recyclability will offset the higher cost of aluminium  -
about three times that of steel  - and the large amounts of energy needed to
produce it.
Despite its drawbacks, aluminium now appears to be the front-running
material to break the long monopoly held by steel in car bodies. Predictions
by chemical companies in the 1980s that plastic composites could take over
the role from steel appear to be foundering, mainly because of recycling
difficulties.
According to Franz-Josef Paefgen, head of body development at Audi, the
average aluminium content in current vehicles is already between 6.7 and 11
per cent. However, this is mainly in mechanical components such as engine
blocks and gearbox housings; weight savings in these areas have been more
than offset by more sophisticated comfort, safety and other features.
Reversing the trend is only possible through the 'quantum leap' offered by
an aluminium body, says Paefgen, because the body typically accounts for
between 20 and 30 per cent of total vehicle weight.
There are important implications for energy consumption because a 10 per
cent lighter vehicle yields a 7 per cent reduction in fuel consumption.
Simply replicating a conventional car body in aluminium would not work
because of the different strength and behaviour of the two metals.
But the skeleton and panel cladding approach used for the ASF goes well
beyond the classic concept of a 'space frame'. It is formed from mainly
box-sectioned extrusions joined to complex, ribbed and extremely strong
die-cast components at highly-stressed corners and connecting points. This
lends extreme rigidity to the structure. One-third fewer individual parts
are needed than in a conventional body.
Load-bearing components are joined mainly by continuous welds, also giving
greater rigidity than spot welds. The stressed skin panels are mostly joined
by a punched riveting process being used for the first time on a car body.
Audi and Alcoa say this allows higher-quality consistency than is possible
with conventional panel attachments.
The end result, according to Heinrich Timm, manager of Audi's fundamental
concepts activities, is a body shell 40 per cent stiffer and 40 per cent
lighter than a steel equivalent. Asked why people have not been driving
aluminium cars for years if the concept is so good, he says it has required
the advent of the supercomputer, with its enormous processing power, to make
the ASF feasible.
'For budget and time reasons,' he says, 'such a revolutionary change in body
construction technology, together with the use of a material which has been
previously unknown in this application, is not possible without the
extensive use of a supercomputer.' The computer simulation techniques so
essential in the development process were simply not available before.
Now that they exist Audi has high hopes that the nature of the structures
and the manufacturing processes will allow it to develop and make different
models more quickly and cheaply.
Headaches, however, have been plentiful. Aluminium's elasticity and
elongation characteristics make it more difficult than steel to press into
multi-curvature panels, thus needing extra care and precision in die-making.
Panels have to be transported in special containers as they are more
vulnerable to scratching than steel. The structurally crucial die castings,
made with the Vacural process in which the die is evacuated before the
molten aluminium is injected, require extreme care in the control of the
casting process and of the smelt, while the parts themselves must be
carefully heat treated.
Some of the joining processes, such as punch riveting, are new or have been
extensively adapted from conventional processes, in each case requiring very
careful development but ultimately proving well worth the effort.
A significant advantage is that the ASF structure has only about one-third
the number of body parts that a steel monocoque contains. Arguably, this is
necessary as the manufacturing process is still more labour intensive than
with steel and will remain so until a breakthrough into high volumes of
smaller cars makes investment in new forms of automation viable. Only about
10 per cent of the assembly process is automated.
There are other manufacturing quirks too  - for example, the need to heat
the completed bodyshell to 210'c for 30 minutes to give it the required
strength.
Audi will market the car as a lighter, more responsive, fuel-efficient and
longer lasting luxury car than any steel-bodied counterpart.
'The question will not be how long the car will last but when the customer
decides that he wants a new one,' according to Wolfgang Ullrich, head of
Audi's factory service centres.
Will Audi price the car at a significant premium over a conventional model?
It is not saying yet. The pricing policy for the ASF will be decided early
next year.

Chewing gum may lose its flavour on the bed-post overnight, but it certainly
does not lose its adhesive properties. These prove a nightmare for transport
authorities, street cleaners and even nightclub owners.
Perpetual Environmental, of Henley-On-Thames, has come to the rescue with
GumAway, which uses citrus juices to soften the gum. It takes just a few
seconds to soften the gum, which can then be peeled away and the surface
washed down with water to prevent staining. GumAway is designed for use on
both hard surfaces, such as floors, and fabrics. Perpetual Environmental:

The problem many finance departments or accountants face when using PC
spreadsheets is that everyone in the department is working on a different
copy of the software  - some of which can contain out-of-date or inaccurate
information.
With the move towards 'client-server' computing with one central database,
Arbor Software of Santa Clara has developed Essbase analysis software which
does away with the proliferation of data.
Essbase holds the information on the server to be drawn down by each user as

<TEXT>
After 30 years of research, a French company has devised a way to dispose of
domestic refuse  - by getting earthworms to eat it.
The technique, developed by Sovadec, of Montelimar, involves the strict
control of temperature and humidity to ensure the maximum amount of organic
materials are ingested and broken down into worm compost.
When the rubbish arrives the refuse sacks are torn open and the material is
sorted into glass, plastic, metals and so on. The organic material is
disinfected and then passes into the 'verbicomposter' (incubator)  - the
most important element in the Naturba process. Here the worms eat the
rubbish, after which a drying process separates the compost from the
remaining refuse. Sovadec: France, 75 01 30 43.

Most British businesses know that if they address their envelopes in the
required format  - so that automated equipment can read them  - they will
get a discount on their postage rates.
Capscan, of London, has introduced Matchcode, a compact disc which contains
all the UK's postal addresses in the required format. If addresses are
entered into the computer in a random fashion, Matchcode will automatically
format them, adding postcodes where necessary. The data can be used to
adjust individual addresses as they are typed in, or to manipulate batches
of addresses on a database. Matchcode can also be used for rapid addressing.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Management: Struggling with the curse of success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DOMINANT companies
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the Kodaks, General Motors and IBMs of this world  - used to be held up as
models for lesser fry to emulate. Remember In Search of Excellence, that
best-seller full of gung-ho 'lessons from America's best-run companies', as
its subtitle claimed?
The troubles which have afflicted many of them since it was published barely
a decade ago have taught us all to be a little more sceptical. The market
shares of such enterprises may soar for a while and their profits defy
gravity, but it has become obvious that most eventually fall prey to what is
known in academic circles as 'the curse of incumbency'.
When an innovator attacks their market, most incumbents fail to react
effectively. Within a few years, even months in some unstable sectors, they
are toppled from their perch  - Kodak by Fuji, GM by Ford, Toyota, Honda and
Nissan, and IBM by the combined forces of clones, workstations, personal
computers and Microsoft. A related example is Wang, which dominated word
processing until PCs almost sank it.
The popular explanation for this phenomenon is the 'fat and lazy' syndrome:
a company grows over-confident, careless and sluggish, and either fails to
spot the significance of an innovation or cannot stir itself to take
remedial action until it is too late. In the post-war years most steam
locomotive makers fell into this trap when they finally perceived the
challenge from diesel-electrics was serious.
As you might expect, academics suggest a set of more complex explanations.
These attribute the phenomenon to economic, political or behavioural factors
 - or to a mixture of all three.
In a draft research paper, Diana Day of Philadelphia's Wharton School comes
down against the economic view: that incumbents make a conscious choice not
to innovate so as not to hit their existing 'rent' stream and the value of
their underlying assets.
Rebecca Henderson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology takes a more
catholic line. She suggests rational economics plays a part, although the
fundamental problem is what she calls the power of 'embedded architecture'.
As successful companies learn more and more about their existing products,
services and ways of operating she says, this knowledge becomes deeply
embedded within them: in their communications channels, information and
accounting systems, strategies, structures and cultures. So they have
difficulty recognising the innovative threat, and take too long to launch
remedial action.
Up to this point, Henderson's account parallels the 'inward focus'
explanation of unresponsiveness put forward by Les Alberthal, chairman of
EDS, the IT services giant which is striving to avoid the problem (see this
page, October 15). But Henderson elaborates further.
Even if an incumbent manages to remain strategically alert and
organisationally flexible, she says, uncertainty over whether the attacker
will succeed may make it hold back from emulating the rival's innovation  -
and thereby cannibalising its own product and considerable investment.
If, for instance, a maker of chocolate bars began to promote the idea of
consuming its products for breakfast  - a less far-fetched proposition than
it might seem, since at least one manufacturer has considered it  - Kellogg
would think a hundred times before following suit, Henderson told last
month's annual conference of the Strategic Management Society in Chicago.
Instead of rushing to destroy its market for cornflakes and other cereals,
plus decades of its own investment, Kellogg would hold back and try to play
safe by extending its existing products  - a process known generally as
'incremental innovation'. It might, for instance, launch banana-flavoured
corn flakes, Henderson suggested.
The depth of an incumbent's dilemma was illustrated further at the
conference by P. Ranganath Nayak, a senior vice-president of the Arthur D.
Little consultancy.
As he pointed out, it is easy to recognise the potential of an innovation in
retrospect, but tough at the time. Jet aircraft were once predicted to
supersede propeller-driven aircraft completely, but have failed to do so.
Microwave ovens were expected to oust conventional ones, but have expanded
the market for home cooking.
The pace of substitution is also difficult to predict. Diesel locomotives
took about 20 years to replace the steam variety, while the partial
incursion of jet engines into the propeller market was rapid, as was the
take-off of the microwave oven market. Cash registers went electronic almost
overnight, while compact discs have taken longer to oust long-play vinyl
records.
As Nayak says, the only solution is to watch constantly for competitive
threats, especially from unexpected directions.
To overcome their internal defences against innovation and
self-cannibalisation, he advises incumbent companies to maintain a strong,
but not necessarily large, central research and development effort, on the
grounds that 'you can't ask the people who run an existing business to
replace it'.
To help create successful innovations, Nayak says that companies must also
foster 'skunkworks' (small entrepreneurial teams), and collaborate more
closely with customers, suppliers and competitors .
Companies should also use a 'balanced scorecard' of measures, comprising not
just financial yardsticks but also information on customers and technology.
Above all, chief executives must be iconoclasts. As Nayak puts it, 'if the
top is committed deeply to maintaining the status quo, there's no hope'.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Management: In search of the stars / A look at the scramble
to find the right winners for a multitude of business awards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the offices of JO Hambro in the City of London, a panel of the great and
the good are sifting through a list of captains of industry in search of the
1993 Businessman of the Year. Across town in the west end a group of women
are poring over hundreds of female success stories to find Cosmopolitan
magazine's Achiever of the Year.
All across the country the search is on for big businessmen, small
businessmen, young businessmen, old businessmen. It is on for businesswomen
and potential businesswomen. It is on for entrepreneurs and venture
capitalists. There are so many awards for business stars that you could get
from one end of the year to another eating nothing but celebratory meals at
Claridges and the Savoy.
Are all these awards getting out of hand? Why are there so many? Are the
right prizes going to the right people?
Companies like awards because they are cheap PR. If all goes well, the
sponsor stands to gain copious publicity as well as getting its name
associated with business success. Newspapers and magazines also like them
for the PR value. Professional bodies see their members rewarded and
motivated. And the public simply likes reading about the winners.
'There can't be too many,' says Rhiannon Chapman of the Industrial Society,
a veteran adjudicator of business awards. 'There is a great hunger for
signposts to success. People need to feel things are possible.'
Yet judging the business awards is not like judging the Booker prize. A
novel can be remaindered but it cannot lead a company which goes bankrupt.
If a businessperson wins a prize one year and the company subsequently gets
into difficulty, he or she may destroy the standing of the award in the
process.
The Guardian's Young Businessman of the Year award made a few unfortunate
choices and came unstuck as a result. After selecting Sir Clive Sinclair,
John Gunn of British and Commonwealth, and John Ashcroft of Coloroll  - all
of whom ran companies which subsequently hit hard times  - The Guardian
quietly scrapped the award three years ago.
One way around the problem is to play safe. This is the approach adopted by
judges of the Hambro Businessman of the Year award and the Institute of
Management's Gold Medal. Both go for what many might consider the obvious
names, often picking the same people: Sir Arnold Hall of Hawker Siddeley,
Sir Owen Green of BTR, Lord Seiff of Marks and Spencer and Sir Terence
Beckett of Ford have both awards on their mantlepieces, while Sir Robert
Scholey of British Steel picked up both titles in the same year.
But even the big names are not always a certainty. Gerald Ronson of Heron
was Businessman of the Year in 1984, while last year's choice of Lord King
was perhaps a little unfortunate, coming as it did just before news of
British Airways' dirty tricks campaign.
Whether or not the choice is a sound one, it is not immediately clear why
prizes should be given to those who have already reached the top. The
answer, says Ailsa Dempster of the Institute of Management, is less to
glorify the winner and more to motivate others. The same rationale clearly
applies to awards aimed at special groups  - businesswomen and entrepreneurs
 - who are in greater need of role models.
When Veuve Clicquot launched its Businesswoman of the Year award 21 years
ago, it was the only prize of its sort. Now women's magazines, clearing
banks, building societies, accountancy companies and office equipment
suppliers jostle to reward successful women.
There has been a similar scramble to give prizes to entrepreneurs and small
business people, the Venturer of the Year award (sponsored by Cartier, the
Financial Times and the British Venture Capital Association) being one
prominent example.
Most of the awards have the standard posh lunch and a standard big name
presenting the prize. Some  - such as the Businessman of the Year award  -
are charity functions.
Some prizes are more worth winning than others: the more prominent the
winner the worse the prize. The Businessman of the Year receives a trophy
and a modicum of honour. The Gold Medal comes mounted in a perspex shell.
The Businesswoman of the Year wins a silver tastevin, but she also gets a
gourmand's trip to Rheims, a vine named after her and champagne on her
birthday for the rest of her life. Cartier offers a Pounds 5,000 watch. The
magazines offer money, holidays and telecoms equipment. The
Cosmopolitan/Arthur Anderson High Flier gets a paid place at business
school.
For the sponsors the main cost is not the prize but the expense of selecting
the winners. Moira Collins, who runs the Veuve Clicquot award, says picking
the right person requires months of effort. It is not an exact science, but
careful study of the paperwork and site visits are necessary.
Collins argues women are less likely to take a tumble than men: 'Most
businesswomen have plodded away. But a lot of those boys, they were higher
up and had further to fall.' Veuve Clicquot has had to hide its blushes
twice in 21 years: it awarded prizes to Debbie Moore of Pineapple and Sophie
Mirman of Sock Shop, both companies which suffered from over-expansion in
the 1980s.
The awards for women face the further difficulty of having a limited number
of candidates to choose from. 'When Anita Roddick won, everyone complained
she has been discovered to death. When Gisela Burg won, they said 'who on
earth is she?',' says Collins.
The Institute of Directors, until recently a sponsor of the Veuve Clicquot
prize, admits that the enthusiasm of some of its members has faded. 'There
is a feeling among our 2,600 women directors that special events for them
are not quite what they want,' says Gordon Leak, media relations director.
While awards proliferate, many hard-working managers, burrowing away in big
corporations, are excluded altogether. This is partly because their
achievement is more difficult to spot and measure, and partly because
colleagues can be less than supportive. Veuve Clicquot is trying to include
more corporate women in its award, but finds it difficult. 'Corporate women
who get nominated don't get a good time from colleagues. They get teased
mercilessly  - the men are quite jealous.'
Most successful business people are not entrepreneurs, they have not just
done a management buy-out and they are not captains of industry. 'Being a
director of a company is interesting, difficult and rewarding,' argues Leak.
He believes a medal should be created to mark the unsung heroes.

FT  22 OCT 93 / The Property Market: Sporting chance of picking plum prizes
 -Inward investment agencies are an essential tool for attracting business
to a region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
At the turn of the last century, according to local legend, a spectacular
life-size elephant made of walnuts was the focus of a campaign to attract
business to Los Angeles. Some 84 years later, in a similar, but grander,
exercise, Los Angeles hosted the Olympic Games, winning unprecedented
plaudits for wooing large-scale private sector investment in the city's
infrastructure.
The Olympic Games are a prime example of how a city can establish momentum
for regeneration, through a combination of private and public sector
initiatives.
The competition surrounding the award last month of the millenium games to
Sydney illustrates just how prized the games are  - both for the sporting
prestige and, more lasting, the boost they can give to job creation,
redevelopment of run-down areas and the wider regional economy of a city.
The pressures on cities to compete to attract business have rarely been so
intense. A vital carrot for business is the attractiveness, allied to fiscal
incentives, of the location and local infrastructure from transport to
services.
Cities are, accordingly, responding in a variety of ways:
Some cities appear to be paralysed by the scale and nature of the changes
affecting them and are doing little beyond the discharge of their immediate
and historic activities of public service provision and statutory planning;
Other cities, while acutely aware of the new environment of competition,
have engaged in costly and sometimes unsophisticated attempts at city
promotion, such the publication of glossy brochures and videos.
The most enterprising cities take a closely regulated business-planning
approach to the development of their economies with strategies to promote
their strengths and combat their weaknesses. This is designed to attract and
sustain companies in the global marketplace and hence the city's long-term
competitiveness.
A characteristic feature of the last group is the setting up of special
agencies charged with the job of attracting such new investment.
Lyon's agency, for instance, has been instrumental in 'changing perceptions
of the city'. The city's activities have assured its 'second city' status
and at the same time persuaded some top companies to relocate from Paris to
Lyon. Glasgow's agency secured 4,000 jobs in 1992-93. Milton Keynes, a new
town in southern England has had a continuous strategy since its creation in
the mid-1960s, and its agency receives four investment inquiries a day.
Dusseldorf's agency has helped attract a strong international client-list of
companies to the city; its biggest coup was being selected as the location
for the first Russian trade centre (370,000 square feet) in Europe. These
cities have taken the decision to promote their economies and, with the
exception of Glasgow, none are in areas identified by central government  -
or regional trading blocs such as the European Community  - as requiring
special assistance in terms of priority regional aid.
The agencies vary significantly in the numbers of people they employ and
their costs. Those with the larger number of staff, such as Berlin, play a
more extensive role in providing grants and other financial incentives and
services to prospective and existing client-companies. The main role of
smaller agencies is to concentrate on attracting inquiries and introducing
companies to the appropriate range of local government and professional
services. These agencies also vary in terms of the size of their marketing
budgets, which can ultimately determine the success of their campaigns to
'sell the city'. The marketing budget is an important demonstration of a
city's commitment to its economy and its faith in the agency's ability to
attract companies.
It is difficult to determine the exact impact of the agencies on job
creation and added value. Most agencies keep these numbers under wraps.
Performance on these criteria largely depend on the length of time the
agency has been running.
Without exception agencies are seen as an essential focal point for the
promotion of internal and external business in their respective cities. They
are also seen as important influences in creating a suitable climate for
business. They play the vital role of conduit, feeding back to the city
strategists important data and intelligence on how the current and potential
business 'consumer' sees the needs and priorities for local and central
government investment in infrastructure, training, education, environment
and other city services.
A well thought-out and widely promoted strategy for a city's long-term
growth is also viewed as an important marketing tool for agencies. A city's
long-term vision, encompassing the gamut of physical regeneration and the
provision of services, can tip the balance in persuading companies to
relocate.
Hosting high-profile events, such as the Olympic Games, needs to be seen in
the context of a city's overall marketing strategy. A 'big bang' marketing
event  - such as hosting an Olympic Games  - is widely viewed as a
significant short-cut way of generating an instant international profile
(ideal for an emerging city keen to attract international clients) besides
stimulating infrastructure improvements.
In Barcelona, for instance, which hosted the Olympic Games in 1992, the
long-term benefits of the games included improvements to the city's
international airport, the regeneration of depressed areas and the
transformation of the waterfront. In England, KPMG, an accountancy and
management consultancy, estimates that had Manchester won the millenium
games, the regional economy would have benefited by some Pounds 4bn in extra
spending power and in the creation of about 11,000 jobs.
The cumulative impact of a successful Manchester bid would have been worth
about 10 per cent of north-west England's present annual gross domestic
product. The direct capital investment needed to stage the games would have
been Pounds 1.5bn; but the legacy would have been world-class sporting and
commercial facilities.
But though Manchester's bid failed, the process of making it had an
important catalytic effect: it has brought together local government and
local companies. Such private-public sector alliances are likely to remain a
feature of current and future successful city economic development.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Lottery bidders plan Pounds 3m spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT LEAST two potential applicants to run the UK's National Lottery plan to
spend Pounds 2m to Pounds 3m on preparations before their bids go in.
Both the Great British Lottery Company, which includes Granada, Carlton
Communications and Associated Newspapers; and Camelot, whose investors
include Cadbury Schweppes, De La Rue and Racal Electronics, have each hired
about 100 people.
The evidence of considerable detailed planning comes as the National Lottery
Bill was receiving royal assent. Details on further progress for the
lottery, which could have an annual turnover of Pounds 3bn to Pounds 4bn,
will be spelled out by the National Heritage department today.
Mr Gerry Robinson, chairman of the Great British Lottery Company and chief
executive of the Granada Group, said: 'We believe we have put more time,
money and effort into it than anyone else.'
The consortium, which also includes the Vodafone Group and Hambros, the
merchant bank, is testing systems and modelling lottery games.
'We have invested the money before we know the details. It's a calculated
risk,' said Mr Robinson, who believes that television will be a key
ingredient in marketing the idea of a lottery as fun.
Mr David Rigg of Camelot, whose other shareholders are GTECH, the US company
that supplies and runs equipment to more than 60 lotteries around the world,
and ICL, the computer company, said yesterday his consortium had been
working on its lottery plans for three years. It is clear that Camelot is
already spending considerable sums of money.
Other bids are expected from the Rank Organisation, the Ladbroke group, the
Tote and a consortium linking NM Rothschild and Tattersalls, operators of
the Australian state lottery in Victoria.

FT  22 OCT 93 / People: Tegner - on the Crest of a float
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ian Tegner says he has 'four paid jobs and four unpaid ones'. His latest
paid post is to become non-executive chairman of Crest Packaging, which is
planning its public flotation for the end of this month.
He adds that to his non-executive directorship of Arjo Wiggins Appleton, his
independent directorship with Teeside Power, and his non-executive
chairmanship of a company called Control Risks Group.
Tegner took early retirement from Midland Bank at the end of 1989, where he
had been director of group finance. Before that he had been finance director
of Bowater Industries between 1971 and 1986.
The joys of retirement for Tegner are that 'I only have to take on things
that I have a real interest in'. He is fascinated by the nature of the
business of Control Risks which, among other high-profile (but otherwise
confidential) tasks, was responsible for the security operations involved in
the liquidation of BCCI.
Control Risks advises companies and individuals on preventing risks, but it
also handles responses when trouble - such as 'product extortion', or
blackmail related to tampering with products - breaks out. The company
recruits its staff largely from the armed forces, police and fire services,
'all of which provide sufficiently for people to retire at an age when they
still have plenty of energy' to do other things, says Tegner.
It's clearly a philosophy he endorses; his four 'unpaid' jobs all require
energy. He is on the board of the English Touring Opera company  - 'I say we
are the Heineken of the opera world, taking opera to parts of the country it
normally never goes'; of MacIntyre Care, a charity assisting people with
educational disabilities; of the Argyllshire Gathering, which organises
bagpipe competitions and highland games in Scotland; and of the Countryside
Trust, which exists to help urban children understand the operations of the
countryside.
He sees his interest in Crest - subject of a management buy-out from Bowater
in May 1985 - as being a continuation of the central theme that guides his
activities these days; get involved with what you find interesting, whatever
that might be.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Lively opening brings a disappointing end-game: It is
difficult to see chess as the snooker of the 1990s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS A SPECTATOR sport the world championship chess clash between Gary
Kasparov and Nigel Short never appeared fully to catch fire. It is unlikely
to become the snooker of the 1990s.
It failed to grab the national attention in spite of a controversial start,
a British challenger for the first time in living memory, and a London
venue. However, at the grassroots the match does appear to have made an
impact, although it may take years for that to be felt.
To the players, exhausted after 20 games, it probably feels like a lifetime
since they founded the breakaway Professional Chess Association and invited
bids to stage the match in defiance of Fide, the game's world governing
body.
A consortium of Times Newspapers and Teleworld Holdings, a
telecommunications group with a headquarters in Rotterdam, won the rights to
stage the match with a bid of Pounds 1.7m in prize money. The group beat off
four rival bids. Channel 4 gained exclusive television rights in the UK for
an undisclosed sum.
The match was staged in the Savoy Theatre, London, which can seat 1,000, so
there was the prospect of 24,000 ticket sales at prices from Pounds 150 to
Pounds 45. In the event the television cameras have often as not shown a
half-empty theatre. Ticket prices were heavily discounted.
Teleworld abandoned its Europe-wide 'Predict-a-move' telephone chess line
after three games. The company had envisaged 2,000 armchair players phoning
in each game at rates of 36p and 48p a minute. Mr Wytze de Back,
vice-president of corporate communications at Teleworld said: 'We were
disappointed. We never received more than 500 calls and had to drop the idea
in Europe at least.'
Both the Times and Channel 4 declared themselves pleased with the
tournament. Mr Phil Lawlor, the head of promotion at The Times, said: 'We
did not cover our costs, but in sponsorship you do not expect to. That is
not the way it works. We received more than 72 hours of television exposure
for our brand.'
Mr Lawlor dismissed the notion that the matches were badly attended. He
said: 'Most days between 600 and 700 tickets were sold, and the theatre was
two thirds full. But people did not stay seated all the time.'
Channel 4 said the company also regarded the tournament as a success, and
added: 'We had cumulative audiences of between 1.75m and 2m on match days
for the three programmes.'
Mr David Ellender, sales director of Television International which is part
of Polygram and syndicated television coverage outside the UK said: 'The
tournament sold reasonably well.'
Mr Raymond Katz, manager of Hatchards in London's Piccadilly, said the shop
saw more interest in chess books because of the tournament, but added:
'There has been a rise of interest for some time, particularly young
people.'
Someone in no doubt that the tournament made an impact was Mr Richard
Feather, a director of Chess and Bridge, which publishes Chess Monthly, as
well as books on chess and chess sets.
He said: 'There has been a terrific increase in interest. I would say our
sales have increased 300 per cent because of the match. Chess Monthly has
sold an extra 1,000 copies. We have also seen an increase in City
headhunters and job agencies interested in using chess for recruitment.'

FT  22 OCT 93 / Wife wins mortgage battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS BRIDGET O'BRIEN, a mother of six who acted as surety for her husband's
business debts, yesterday won her six-year legal battle with Barclays Bank,
allowing her to stay in the matrimonial home.
The House of Lords ruled that she was entitled to set aside a charge over
her home in Slough, Berkshire, because her husband had lied about the extent
of the guarantee liability and Barclays had failed to explain the
transaction to her and to suggest she seek independent legal advice.
Mrs O'Brien's victory will give hope to hundreds of people facing eviction
from their homes after being pressured or tricked into acting as surety for
their partner's borrowings.
But giving judgment, Lord Browne-Wilkinson warned that a person could not
disown their obligations just because they subsequently proved they had not
fully understood the transaction.
To escape obligations the person had to show misrepresentation or undue
influence by the partner.
After the decision Mrs O'Brien said it had been a long fight, but 'worth
it'. She urged people having similar disputes with banks to 'keep fighting'.
In a second, related, case the law lords rejected the appeal of a woman who
had been induced by her domineering husband to apply for a second mortgage
on the matrimonial home so he could play the stock market. The court said
that CIBC Mortgages v Pitt was different from the O'Brien case in that Mr
and Mrs Pitt were joint borrowers.
Although Mr Pitt had exerted undue influence over his wife, there was
nothing to put the mortgage company on notice that there might be a problem.
Mrs O'Brien signed documents for a second mortgage on the matrimonial home
in 1987. The extent of the guarantee liability was Pounds 135,000, although
Mr O'Brien had told his wife it was only Pounds 60,000. When his business
overdraft exceeded Pounds 154,000, the bank sought foreclosure.
The lords said that on the facts Mrs O'Brien had not understood the
transaction. The bank had instructed the sub-branch manager to have the
transaction and extent of the guarantee liability explained to her. This had
not happened. Because of her husband's misrepresentation she had not
realised the charge was for more than Pounds 60,000.
But the five law lords stopped short of ruling that people acting as surety
in such situations should be treated as members of a specially protected
class to whom banks owed a duty of care.
Lord Browne-Wilkinson said in future the rule in this type of case should
be:
That the surety is valid and enforceable unless there has been undue
influence, misrepresentation or other legal wrong by the principal debtor.
If there has, the bank will be 'fixed with constructive notice' of the
surety's right to set aside the transaction unless it took reasonable steps
to ensure that the partner entered into it freely and understood it.
Banks will be deemed to have taken reasonable steps if they have warned the
surety of the amount of their potential liability and of the risks involved
and advised them to take independent legal advice.
Lord Browne-Wilkinson said if the law were thus framed it would hold the
balance fairly between vulnerable people who rely implicitly on their
partners and financial institutions.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Banks welcome a clear decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS welcomed the House of Lords decision for bringing certainty to the
area of what happens to people who act as surety for their partners'
borrowings, Alison Smith writes.
The customers' group which has taken up the cause of Mrs Bridget O'Brien,
the Bank Action Group, saw the judgment as clearing the way to pursue
similar cases.
Both sides of the argument, however, agreed that the decision reinforced the
code of practice which was adopted voluntarily by the banks in March last
year.
Barclays said that the bank did not expect the decision to affect 'the vast
majority' of existing arrangements. 'There is a small number of cases
already in dispute, and as the judgment makes clear, each will turn on its
own facts,' it added.
The British Bankers' Assocation similarly played down the impact of the
decision. It emphasised that the judgment underlined existing practice, and
said that it would not affect the readiness of banks to lend to small
businesses.
The association said it expected there to be only a small number of cases
where not only had independent legal advice had not been suggested but also
where there had been misrepresentation or undue influence and the security
for the loan had had to be called upon.
But Ms Pat Griffiths, the national co-ordinator of the Bank Action Group,
estimated that there were thousands of cases which would be affected by the
judgment. She called for an independent statutory regulator for the banks.
She added: 'We challenge the government to take action now to regularise
British banking practice, as the banks have proved they are incapable of
self-regulation.'

FT  22 OCT 93 / Rise in imports widens non-EC trade gap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHER demand for manufactured imports as the economy recovered was behind a
rise in the trade deficit in the third quarter for countries outside the
European Community.
The non-EC trade gap increased last month to its highest level since
February, underlining concern that with an increasing deficit on trade
within the EC, the gap between imports and exports on a whole-world basis is
likely to worsen.
The Central Statistical Office said yesterday that for trade outside the EC,
UK manufacturers increased prices 14 per cent in the third quarter of this
year compared with the same period last year.
This was in an effort to rebuild profit margins, and came in spite of the
depreciation in sterling of about 12 per cent over the same period. In
theory, the drop in the pound should have enabled many companies to cut
prices of exported goods to increase market share.
A government official said the increase in export prices was 'surprising',
although he pointed out that it came after a long period in which exporters'
profits had been under pressure. In the year to the third quarter, prices of
imported manufactured goods increased by 12 per cent.
In the third quarter the non-EC trade deficit, adjusted for seasonal
variations, came to Pounds 2.56bn, compared with Pounds 2.22bn in the second
quarter. For the first nine months of the year the trade deficit reached
Pounds 7.9bn after a Pounds 9.75bn deficit for all of last year.
Last month the difference between imports and exports for non-EC nations was
Pounds 1.09bn, after a Pounds 729m deficit in August. Much of the change was
explained by reduced exports of gems and higher imports of ships, aircraft
and oil platforms. Excluding these so-called erratic items, the deficit
increased to Pounds 662m last month from Pounds 541m in August.
The non-EC trade deficit on manufactured items rose from Pounds 283m in
August to Pounds 665m in September, the highest figure since December last
year. In the third quarter manufactured imports rose 7 per cent in value on
the previous quarter, compared with a 4.5 per cent rise in exports over the
same period.
Imports of semi-finished manufactured goods - including some classes of
factory components and chemical materials - saw a 9.5 per cent rise in
volume terms between the second and third quarters. The UK recorded an
Pounds 88m deficit on trade with the US and Canada last month, after five
months of small surpluses.
Figures for trade with other EC nations, available up to July, indicate that
the deficit is increasing mainly due to faltering exports. In the first half
of this year, the whole-world deficit was Pounds 7.1bn, after a deficit of
Pounds 13.4bn last year.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, described the latest
figures as 'deeply worrying'.

FT  22 OCT 93 / People: City Solicitor to investigate complaints against
accountants
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Matthew Ives is to become director of the professional conduct department at
the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.
Ives, 45, will take over the position from Brian Harris, QC, who is to
retire on January 4 next year.
His appointment comes at a time when the institute has been under criticism
for failing to act sufficiently quickly and harshly against accountants who
transgress.
He takes over a department that has grown in size from 12 to 40 staff in the
past eight years, and  - like other professional bodies  - is handling a
growing number of complaints  - currently standing at about 3,300 a year.
Ives is currently City Solicitor and Secretary to the City of Westminster in
London. He has worked in Westminster since 1982, and was previously with the
London Borough of Waltham Forest and the London Borough of Haringey.
He stressed yesterday that it was too early to suggest any changes to the
organisation of the department but emphasised the need to balance the
interests of the complainant against the interests of justice.
Andrew Colquhoun, secretary and chief executive of the institute, says that
Ives' work with local authorities had 'sufficient analogies' with his new
regulatory role to make him well suited for the post.
Harris will continue as secretary to the executive committee of the Joint
Disciplinary Scheme, which investigates high profile public interest cases
on behalf of the accountancy profession, such as Barlow Clowes, Maxwell and
BCCI.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Water watchdog praises improved customer service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEVEL of customer service provided by water companies has improved for
the second consecutive year, Ofwat, the industry regulator, said yesterday.
It said in a report that the biggest improvements have been in dealing with
the 13.5m billing queries and 125,000 written complaints received by the 22
water companies and 10 water and sewerage companies in England and Wales in
the year to the end of last March.
Ofwat noted that the companies' response times to customers improved in
spite of a rise of 8.5 per cent in the number of billing enquiries and a 27
per cent increase in written complaints. Ofwat judged individual company
performance against seven measures of service, although its comparisons
between companies were based on four criteria:
Pressure of water mains;
Interruption to supply;
Response to billing queries;
Response to written complaints.
It found that five companies  - Hartlepool Water, Portsmouth Water; Sutton
District Water, York Waterworks and Southern Water Services  - performed
particularly well against all four measures. But North West's 'overall
performance compares unfavourably with the average', according to the
report.
Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat director-general, said the report 'shows that some
companies can achieve a high level of service across the board which sets
the standard that others must achieve'.
The report reveals wide variations in performance levels. A total of 15
companies, for example, reported none or very few properties affected by
unplanned supply disruptions lasting longer than 12 hours. But two companies
 - North West and Yorkshire  - accounted for more than half of the 58,000
properties subject to such interruptions of supply.
Other areas in which Ofwat recorded improvements included a fall in the
number of people affected by water restrictions, such as hosepipe bans, from
6.7m to 4.7m. Ofwat attributed the decrease to greater water availability,
linked in large part to increased rainfall.
The companies also reported a degree of success in cutting the number of
households classified as being at risk from flooding from inadequate sewers.
A total of 20,000 properties are still considered to be at risk, compared
with 22,000 listed in a previous report.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
From snacks to sandwiches could be the motto of David Garman, currently
managing director of KP Foods UK, a division of United Biscuits. For he is
moving to Associated British Foods, where from November 1 he will be
managing director of Allied Bakers, a division of UB.
Twenty years with United Biscuits, Garman, 41, says he is looking forward to
running a business with some of the most famous brand names in the rather
unglamorous world of bread. Sunblest, Vitbe, Allison are all familiar names,
and Garman  - a history graduate of King's College, London University  -
will be working hard to build on their powerful past associations.
Garman has been in charge of KP Foods' UK operations, which have a turnover
of some Pounds 400m annually, since January this year. He says he was
tempted to move to Allied Bakers by the increased scale of the operations he
would be handling. Allied has been considering the appointment for the past
18 months, following the death of Allied's previous managing director, Henry
Jackson, in a car accident.
'United Biscuits has a very good reputation for management development and
training, and I have a wide experience gained from being involved in a
number of the group's operations. But the size of the challenge at Allied,
the characteristics of the market, encouraged to me to move across,' says
Garman.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Oilfield gets go-ahead: Liverpool Bay development to create
thousands of construction jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday gave the go-ahead for the commercial development of
the Liverpool Bay oil and gas field in a move which will create several
thousand construction jobs in north Wales and Merseyside and secure several
thousand others in the fabrication industry which builds the offshore
production rigs.
Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said 1,100 jobs would be created by the
construction of a pipeline receiving terminal at the Point of Ayr, north
Wales, while another 1,000 workers would be needed to build PowerGen's
gas-fired Connah's Quay power station, also in north Wales. It will consume
as much as 300m cu ft of gas a day from the Douglas, Hamilton and Hamilton
North fields which make up the project.
Approval means that the first oil from the Irish Sea should begin to flow in
November 1995. Peak oil production is expected to be about 70,000 barrels a
day, with total reserves estimated at 150m to 200m barrels. The first gas
will be produced in December 1995. The contract to supply gas to PowerGen
starts in mid-1996.
Hamilton Oil, a subsidiary of Broken Hill Proprietary, the Australian steel,
minerals and energy group, will operate the fields, with Lasmo and Monument
Resources as partners. Plans for a fourth field - Lenox - are under way,
with total development costs for the four fields and the gas terminal
estimated at more than Pounds 1bn.
Mr Ed Blair, president of Hamilton, said the developers would give
preference to local companies in selecting contractors. Unemployment rates
are high in the region, with coastal towns near the development, such as
Bootle, having rates as high as 36 per cent in some electoral wards.
The area is unlikely, however, to benefit from the fabrication contracts, as
the bulk of the industry is located in Scotland and the north-east of
England. But Mr Eggar said yesterday that even small companies could develop
an 'offshore culture' which could lead to export opportunities as well as to
contracts to supply the Liverpool Bay project.
He said exploration activity in the Irish Sea was set to intensify, although
Mr Blair said the area was unlikely to have North Sea potential.

FT  22 OCT 93 / London office market revives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OFFICE property market in central London improved considerably in the
past three months, international surveyors Richard Ellis said yesterday.
The revival of interest was due mainly to a surge in investment activity, it
said. But increased occupancy rates were also beginning to underpin
confidence.
Mr John Slade of Richard Ellis said the lack of new development could result
in an undersupply in the mid-1990s.
The survey also found that:
Availability of office space is falling sharply, with total space on the
market down from 25.3m sq ft 12 months ago to 21.8m sq ft. The vacancy rate
in central London has declined from 14 per cent three months ago to 12 per
cent.
Rents are stabilising. Top 'rental value norms' in the West End, the City
and Holborn have remained stable since the end of June.
Investment activity has increased this year.

RED public telephone boxes were making a comeback in central London
yesterday as part of an initiative by Westminster council. British
Telecommunications is installing 62 of the 'K6' red public telephone boxes
as Westminster aims to brighten up the borough in preparation for the new
century.
BT aroused a storm of protest when it removed most of the old-style boxes in
the 1980s. The boxes, designed in the 1930s by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott,
architect of Liverpool Cathedral and Battersea Power Station, are appearing
on a route from Westminster Abbey to St Paul's Cathedral, via the Houses of
Parliament, Whitehall, Trafalgar Square, the Strand, the Royal Courts of
Justice, Fleet Street and Somerset House.
Conservationists are delighted that 25 of the old boxes are replacing modern
kiosks. But as part of the deal between BT and Westminster BT will be able
to put up more modern boxes too.
BT said all requests for K6 red boxes are considered 'on individual merit'
in areas of significant historical interest.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Big business ways 'trickle downward'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME of the financial benefits of new management techniques, such as
just-in-time manufacturing, are gradually trickling down from large
companies to small businesses, according to research by Manchester Business
School.
A regular six-monthly survey of 5,000 companies in north-west England shows
that 31 per cent of small businesses have increased their stock turnover
since the spring. This compared with only 24 per cent in the previous
survey.
The increase is attributed to a knock-on effect from larger companies, which
had reported faster stock turnover during the first six months of this year,
benefiting from the improvement in the economy.
The research also shows that big companies use their muscle to manage
working capital more efficiently at smaller companies' expense. One in 10
large companies collects debts in less than 30 days, compared with 5 per
cent of smaller ones.
Business confidence has fallen sharply in the Midlands amid growing fears
that the recovery may be faltering, the Engineering Employers Federation
said yesterday.

SOME of the financial benefits of new management techniques such as
just-in-time manufacturing are gradually trickling down from large companies
to small businesses, according to research by Manchester Business School.
Big companies are still using their financial muscle at the expense of
smaller businesses.
A regular six-monthly survey of 5,000 companies in north-west England shows
that 31 per cent of small businesses have increased their stock turnover
since the spring. This compared with only 24 per cent in the previous

The increase is attributed to a knock-on effect from larger companies, which
had reported faster stock turnover during the first six months of this year,
benefiting from the improvement in the economy. Modern management techniques
such as just-in-time manufacturing or electronic data interchange are being
used to encourage faster response times from suppliers in an attempt to to
keep all stocks and the money to finance them to a minimum.
Mr Nitin Sanghavi, who carried out the school's research under the
sponsorship of Price Waterhouse, the accountant, said: 'The encouraging
performance of smaller firms suggests these new techniques have improved
efficiency along the supply chain.' The research also shows, however, that
big companies are using their muscle to manage working capital more
efficiently at smaller companies' expense.
One in 10 large companies collect debts in less than 30 days, compared with
only 5 per cent of smaller ones; but 27 per cent of large companies succeed
in stretching credit past 60 days, while only 21 per cent of smaller
companies manage to do so. One result of better efficiency and improving
cashflow is that nearly 48 per cent of large companies have been able to
reduce borrowings in the last six months.
Business confidence has fallen sharply in the Midlands amid growing fears
that the recovery may be faltering, the Engineering Employers Federation
said yesterday.
According to its latest quarterly survey in the east Midlands, the
proportion of engineering companies reporting increased orders fell from 49
per cent in the three months to July to 32 per cent in the past quarter.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Logic was no match for foreign policy: How Pounds 234m of
public money was committed to Malaysia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS MALAYSIANS face power blackouts and a mounting crisis over the supply of
power in the decade ahead, there will be questions over whether the Pergau
hydro-power project being built by Britain's Balfour Beatty is a blight
rather than a blessing.
A damning report from the National Audit Office, released yesterday, says
the project in peninsular Malaysia's eastern state of Kelantan 'would result
in Malaysian consumers paying over Pounds 100m more for electricity over its
35-year life than if the money were invested in an alternative'.
Nor will the British taxpayer be spared: Pounds 234m in aid is to be spent
on the project. The public-spending watchdog says in its report: 'Even if
costs were discounted to their present values, the chosen method of
implementation would cost the UK Pounds 56m more than it might otherwise
have done.' It adds that under the most economical option, aid funds of only
Pounds 108m would have been paid.
Amid sweeping criticism of ministers - including Mr Douglas Hurd, the
foreign secretary - for approving the project in spite of repeated advice
that it was uneconomical, the report illustrates how 'big' projects in
sectors such as power, telecommunications and defence technology have more
to do with foreign policy strategies than with commercial logic.
It says the government went ahead in spite of contrary commercial advice
because 'failure to support the project would have serious consequences for
British relations with the government of Malaysia'.
It also shows how the contractor - in this case a Malaysian associate of
Balfour Beatty - may in the end be the sole beneficiary. The project,
involving the largest cash sum ever provided by the UK government for one
scheme, will for most of the remainder of this century gobble up more than
one fifth of the UK's Pounds 117m budget for aiding British exporters in
contracts in the developing world.
Balfour Beatty first proposed a hydro-power project on the Pergau river in
1988, shortly after Mrs Margaret Thatcher, then prime minister, visited
Malaysia. It ended a difficult decade in which Dr Mahathir Mohamad,
Malaysia's prime minister, had enforced a 'Buy British Last' policy.
The initial Balfour Beatty proposal, provisionally estimated at between
Pounds 200m and Pounds 300m, followed a World Bank report concluding that
Malaysia should concentrate on gas-fired electricity generation.
By January 1989, when Balfour Beatty presented a formal contract proposal,
the estimated cost had risen to Pounds 317m. Even at this early stage, the
Overseas Development Administration, which is responsible for managing
Britain's aid policy, said that the project 'presented major problems in
terms of size, price and timing'.
By February 1990, after several further appraisals, and a rise in the
proposed contract price to Pounds 397m, the development body concluded:
'Pergau would be a very bad buy and a burden on Malaysian consumers.' It
proposed delaying the project for nine years after a study of the Malaysian
power sector concluded that Pergau would be uneconomic before 2005.
The body's accounting officer said in a memorandum to the Treasury that his
responsibility to ensure aid funds were 'administered in a prudent and
economical manner' was not consistent with supporting Pergau.
Nevertheless, in July 1991 Mr Hurd instructed the accounting officer to
commit Pounds 234m against the aid programme for the project.
The accounting officer was equally disturbed by funding arrangements for the
project, the Audit Office report shows. Faced with three options - a simple
mixed credit; a combination of soft loans and mixed credit; and a full soft
loan - the government chose the third, in spite of the fact that over the
14-year life of the project this would cost taxpayers Pounds 56m more.
Mixed credit would have involved private bank funding, with the government
providing an up-front grant of about Pounds 70m in the peak year.
The soft loan will involve a five-year grace period on repayment, and
subsidised loan interest charges of less than 1 per cent. The report says
the latter option was chosen, in spite of its higher long-term cost, because
budgetary constraints barred it from committing such a large lump sum in one
financial year. The soft-loan option kept peak costs below Pounds 27m in any
one year.
Ironically, stricter international rules agreed last year on mixing aid with
commercial credits would have made the project ineligible for aid. Power
projects are seen as 'commercially viable' and should be funded
commercially.

THE Post Office has secured two High Court writs in the past fortnight
calling on leaders of the UCW communications union to repudiate unofficial
action at sorting offices in London and Manchester under the threat of heavy
financial damages, Robert Taylor writes.
The first writ concerned disruption at London's Mount Pleasant sorting
office in a row over overtime working. It was issued on October 8 and
withdrawn five days later after intensive negotiations led to a settlement.
This week the Post Office secured a writ over unofficial disruption being
taken at sorting offices in Manchester. A further High Court hearing is
planned for today.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Riot jail was 'at risk for months'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DANGER of riot at Wymott Prison, the 1970s showpiece jail destroyed last
month by inmates, had been widely known for months, Judge Stephen Tumim,
chief inspector of prisons, said yesterday.
In a damning report on the causes of the riot at the prison in Leyland,
Lancashire, the judge said it was disturbing that the risk of riot had been
signalled as far back as his own unannounced inspection of the prison 10
months earlier. In the days before the riot on September 6, the jail had
been 'close to anarchy', he said.
In the seven months before the riot, the incident log for B Wing included
repeated reports of inmates being beaten up, false fire alarms, cells and
windows smashed up and fires. His inspection had found a world of drugs and
bullying with violent gangs terrifying inmates and turning parts of the
prison into no-go areas for staff.
The shortage of cells in the north-west had led to violent and volatile
criminals being sent to Wymott even though it was 'no more than an open
prison with a fence round it', Judge Tumim said.
He called for standard cell doors so prisoners could be locked in; better
trained night staff; improvements in staff/inmate relations; and more
effective anti-drug measures.
Welcoming the report Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, said there were
'important lessons to be learnt'.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Cable venture launched for south Wales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A JOINT venture company set up by South Wales Electricity and International
CableTel of the US plans to invest about Pounds 200m in building a cable TV
and telephone network covering most of urban south Wales.
The venture, one of the largest cable investments in the UK announced this
year, will cover Cardiff, Newport and West Glamorgan, embracing more than
300,000 homes and 26,000 businesses.
It marks a significant diversification for South Wales Electricity (Swalec),
one of the 12 privatised electricity distribution companies in England and
Wales. Swalec forecasts that 10 per cent of its earnings could come from the
joint venture by the year 2000.
The launch follows Swalec's decision earlier this week to buy the cable
franchise for West Glamorgan and CableTel's success earlier this month in
raising more than Dollars 400m (Pounds 265m) in debt and equity in New York
to finance new UK cable ventures.
Mr Wynford Evans, Swalec's chairman, said the deal offered 'significant
business and domestic potential'. The new fibre optic network would give
'enormous opportunities for expansion'.
The joint venture will involve an initial investment of Pounds 75m by the
two companies - Pounds 30m from Swalec, Pounds 45m from CableTel. Once the
company reaches positive cashflow, it plans to raise another Pounds 125m to
complete its network.
In addition to equity, Swalec will use its billing and customer service
systems for the new venture. CableTel will contribute expertise in cable
operation. Swalec expects that within ten years half of the residents in its
south Wales area will be taking cable TV and more than a third cable
telephone.
So far only one other regional electricity distributor has entered the
telecommunications market - Yorkshire Electricity, which is constructing a
regional fibre-optic network covering Yorkshire and Humberside. However, the
National Grid, owned jointly by the 12 distributors, is erecting an optical
fibre network on its pylons.
Other privatised utilities are also entering the market. In August Yorkshire
Water took a stake in a joint venture to build a cable network for
Yorkshire. The other partners are Singapore Telecom and Generale des Eaux,
the French diversified services group.
In the two years since the ending of the UK telecoms duopoly between BT and
Mercury, cable operators have recruited nearly 250,000 subscribers to their
telephone networks.

FT  22 OCT 93 / BR telecoms arm to be privatised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL Telecommunications, a wholly-owned BR subsidiary, is to be sold
late next year. The government said it has the potential to compete with BT
and Mercury in the UK's telecoms market.
Announcing the sale yesterday, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said
that responsibility for rail signalling safety would pass to Railtrack,
which will assume ownership of the rail network under the government's
privatisation plans.
Although BRT will continue to supply signalling, communications and business
services to the railway, Railtrack is likely to be free to employ other
private-sector suppliers, with BRT free to use spare capacity to sell to
other companies, provided it gains the necessary public licences.
In the year to April BRT had a gross income of Pounds 114m and made an
operating surplus of Pounds 22m. With cables running alongside 60,000 miles
of track, Mr MacGregor said BRT's network 'could be exploited for external
telecommunications customers'.
He added: 'There are excellent opportunities for private-sector involvement
in rail telecommunications while safeguarding operational requirements.' A
study of BRT's investment requirements is under way.
However, doubt was cast over the sell-off earlier this month with the sudden
departure of Mr Peter Borer, BRT's managing director.
Mr Borer is believed to have clashed with Sir Bob Reid, BR chairman, over
the sell-off plans. He had been attempting to promote a management buy-out
of BRT with a view to making it a national telecoms competitor. But the
necessary private-sector backing for the venture does not appear to have
been forthcoming.
The investment is necessary to extend the trackside lines to homes and
businesses. Telecoms operators including Singapore Telecom are believed to
have expressed interest, but to have gone no further.
Mr Tony Newton, leader of the House of Commons, refused to be drawn
yesterday on whether the government would seek to reverse the defeats it has
suffered in the House of Lords on the railways bill when it returns to the
Commons, Ivor Owen writes.
He said ministers were still considering the implications of amendments made
by peers which permit BR to seek franchises to operate passenger services,
and requiring the government to guarantee the solvency of the industry's
pension fund.
Mr Newton insisted that it would not be appropriate for him to make any
further comment until the consideration had been completed.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Engineers' body set to open in China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INSTITUTION of Electrical Engineers is to become the first European
engineering society to establish a branch in China when it opens a centre in
Beijing next week.
The move, announced yesterday, is an important step for the institution,
which has more than 130,000 members and is Europe's largest professional
engineering society.
It is part of an increasing push by the bigger UK institutions into emerging
markets, where their unique role as qualifying bodies makes them attractive
to local engineers.
The institution is establishing a 10-city network in eastern Europe and
former Soviet Union countries, while the Institution of Mechanical Engineers
is looking at possible co-operation with national societies in Hong Kong,
Malaysia and Singapore.
Professor Peter Lawrenson, the institution's immediate past president, said
it was confident that the Beijing branch would be of value to the Chinese
engineering profession and Chinese industry as a whole.
Engineering institutions are not trade associations, but the institution
said that visits to China by its UK members would represent a way for them
to increase business by 'networking' with their Chinese counterparts.
The institution has 20 members in China, but said that more than 400
engineers are waiting to join.
Once Chinese membership has risen, staff would be taken on to work at the
Beijing branch.
The aim is to help the development of electrical, electronic and
manufacturing in China by stimulating the transfer of technology through the
institution's publications, conferences and its information services.
Mr Ma Yuzhen, the Chinese ambassador to London, said: 'As the world's
fastest growing economy, we want to increase our technological links with
the UK.'

FT  22 OCT 93 / Car output growth defies forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAR PRODUCTION continued to expand in September, confounding industry
warnings that growth would be halted by the decline in sales of new cars in
continental Europe.
Although production of cars for export fell sharply, by 23.12 per cent to
46,777 compared with 60,841 last September, the total still rose last month
by a further 11.89 per cent, on a year-on-year basis, to 116,046 from
103,716.
Statistics issued jointly by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders
and the Central Statistical Office show that production for the first three
quarters of the year reached 1,043,769, up 8.48 per cent on the 962,133 for
the same period last year.
Output in the final quarter would have to fall well below last year's levels
if industry warnings that this year's output will not exceed last year's
1,291,231 are to prove justified.
While crowds flocked to the opening day of the London Motor Show yesterday,
the society remained pessimistic.
Mr Roger King, the society's public-affairs director, said: 'The figures
might appear encouraging but the downturn within the EC and the hesitancy of
the UK marketplace suggest that immediate prospects for the industry must be
regarded with caution.'
Production for the UK market jumped by 61.6 per cent last month to 69,269
units - attributed to a rebuilding of stocks after the annual August sales
boom and to a further build-up of production by Nissan, Toyota and Honda,
the Japanese carmakers.
The opening of the London show has been marked by clashes between
manufacturers and franchised dealers over the extent to which the seemingly
buoyant market for new cars has been inflated by 'phantom' sales.
The society's more gloomy view is reinforced by commercial vehicle
production. This was 7.17 per cent lower last month, at 17,919, and 27.39
per cent lower for the first three quarters of the year, at 141,400.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Drop in negative equity reported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of homeowners whose property is worth less than their mortgage
loan fell a further 5 per cent in the third quarter of the year to 1.36m,
the Woolwich Building Society said yesterday.
The number of mortgage holders with 'negative equity' as a result of
property price falls since 1990 is now 24 per cent down on the start of the
year. Some 68,000 families were released from negative equity in the third
quarter.
The fall in negative equity, as a result of a 0.5 per cent rise in house
prices, was smaller than in the second quarter, when a 3.2 per cent price
rise reduced the number of negative equity households by 350,000 from its
1.8m peak.
The largest fall in the third quarter was in the south-east, where the
number of households with negative equity dropped by 5.2 per cent from
404,000 to 383,000.
However, the number of households with negative equity rose in the West
Midlands, the north of England and Wales.
There was a 24 per cent rise in the north, with 21,000 households affected
compared with 17,000 in the second quarter.
Mr Peter Robinson, Woolwich managing director, called on Mr Kenneth Clarke,
the chancellor, not to alter mortgage interest tax relief in the Budget next
month because the recovery in the housing market was as yet 'far too
fragile'.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Trusts begin to issue Lloyd's prospectuses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PATHFINDER prospectuses, documents used to market shares, were issued
yesterday for two investment trusts at Lloyd's of London.
Merchant banks, securities houses and Lloyd's agents responded quickly to
the decision by Names on Wednesday to allow corporate investors to
participate in the market.
Sixteen investment trusts, seeking to raise Pounds 1.25bn, have been
announced although there are doubts whether all can reach their capital
targets.
Yesterday's pathfinders were for trusts sponsored by the merchant banks,
Samuel Montagu and SG Warburg. Montagu has teamed up with James Capel and is
aiming to raise Pounds 280m to support 98 syndicates, while Warburg aims to
raise Pounds 150m to support about 20.
Four other investment trusts issued pathfinders before Wednesday's vote,
while a further 10 have announced their intentions to raise funds, many of
them by publishing detailed information memorandums.
With a number of other schemes in the pipeline, the markets could eventually
be asked to find more than Pounds 1.5bn. Salomon Brothers, the US investment
bank which expects to announce a Dollars 300m (Pounds 201.7m) investment
scheme next week, is tapping US investors. But most of the schemes will be
tapping the UK equity market over the next two months. However, according to
financiers seeking to market some of the largest investment trust schemes,
UK investors are unlikely to provide between Pounds 750m and Pounds 1bn in
capital for the schemes, suggesting a possible shortfall of some Pounds
500m.
That indicates that many funds could reduce the amount of capital they are
targeting. 'Downsizing is the name of the game,' said one analyst.
Alternatively, some schemes will fail altogether. 'The reality is that not
all these vehicles will succeed,' said Mr Chris Hitchings, analyst with UBS
Global Research. Mr John Lee, of Lee Schwartz Associates, a research
consultancy, said institutions have been gripped by a 'euphoria of a new
market opening' but also predicted some smaller funds could fail.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Coal mine closure talks set to start
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL is expected to propose a maximum of four pits for closure when
it starts formal talks with unions on colliery prospects, scheduled for the
first week of November. During the following six months up to a further 14
pits will be named for closure. British Coal at present operates 30 pits.
The closures will be announced in small groups at local level, partly
because of the government's desire to minimise publicity.
Details of British Coal's likely timetable and tactics emerged yesterday as
the Labour party gave notice it will launch a full debate on coal in the
Commons on Wednesday. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary,
who has forecast that the workforce will be cut to barely 10,000 by next
spring, will lead the assault.
The government was still undecided last night about the role to be played by
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, who has only just
returned to Westminster following his heart attack and a subsequent bout of
flu. He confined himself to a watching brief when Mr Tim Eggar, energy
minister, informed MPs about the latest developments in the industry on
Wednesday.
Labour leaders have also secured a debate on Tuesday on new regulations on
mine safety.
Neither debate is likely to result in a government defeat. Similarly, local
union officials say there is little stomach in mining communities to fight
the closures.
Under the Modified Colliery Review Procedure, the industry consultation
procedure revived by British Coal on Wednesday, a series of appeals can
delay shutdowns for up to nine months after they have been announced.
In practice, few closures have involved such lengthy procedures. British
Coal said yesterday that since the procedure was introduced in 1985 only
seven mines of a total of 86 eligible to go to final review had done so. All
seven had closed eventually.
Formal negotiations under the procedure are likely to begin the week after
next. They will take place at group level at the northern and Midland
groups, where the bulk of deep mines are located. It then allows for matters
to be referred to pit-level negotiations. If no agreement is reached, the
issue is referred to the group and then to national headquarters.
A final appeal can then be lodged to an independent review panel.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Saudi backing for new BBC service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BBC WORLD Service Television's new Arabic service for the Middle East and
north Africa is being financed by the Mawarid investment and industrial
group of Saudi Arabia, Raymond Snoddy writes.
The deal, agreed in principle, would see WSTV signing a 10-year programme
supply agreement for about Pounds 200m. The actual agreement is with Orbit
Communications, a Rome-based subsidiary of Mawarid, which has shown a
growing interest in all forms of communications.
Orbit's name appeared in legal documents in the dispute between WSTV and Mr
Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation.
The BBC yesterday won an undertaking in the High Court that it will remain
part of the Star Television service in Asia until the full hearing of a
contract dispute.
News Corporation, which controls Star, threatened to terminate the BBC's
10-year contract because of the planned Arabic news service. Star threatened
the action because although the television services involved are very
different there is an overlap in the areas served by the satellites
involved.
Mr Chris Irwin, chief executive of WSTV, expressed satisfaction at the
undertaking.

FT  22 OCT 93 / BA to face 'dirty tricks' case in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RICHARD BRANSON last night launched a near-Dollars 1bn anti-trust law
suit against British Airways for its 'dirty tricks' campaign against Virgin
Atlantic Airways.
The action was filed in New York citing 'unfair and illegal activities' and
accused BA of attempting to impede Virgin's growth and trying to 'destroy it
with targeted predatory anti-competitive practices and acts'.
Virgin's move will now re-open the wounds between the two UK carriers and
revive the highly publicised 'dirty tricks' affair.
Mr Branson said last night: 'Airing another airline's dirty linen in front
of an American audience is not something I would normally choose to do.
However, in the aviation business there is no UK legislation to protect
smaller carriers against anti-competitive and monopolistic behaviour.'
BA paid Pounds 610,000 in libel damages to Virgin in the High Court in
London in January after accepting that Virgin 'had reasonable grounds for
serious concern about the activities of a number of BA employees'. But the
two airlines failed after lengthy negotiations to agree on financial
compensation for Virgin.
Mr Branson said he had hoped after the High Court case that the affair could
have been settled without the need for further action. Virgin had been
willing 'to accept a token sum in recognition of the misdeeds of the past'.
He added that BA has had long enough to take 'positive measures' to prevent
the need for last night's action.
'Not only have they not done so, but we have found ourselves the target of
new monopolistic abuse,' he said.
Virgin is claiming Dollars 325m (Pounds 218.5m) in damages, but said any
award would be trebled up to Dollars 975m by a US court. It is also seeking
an injunction to prevent BA from continuing what it claims are activities
which distort competition and are designed to 'damage and discredit' Virgin.
Virgin specifically claims that BA is attempting to monopolise the
transatlantic market; using its dominant position at London's Heathrow
airport to distort competition on north Atlantic routes; guilty of a variety
of 'dirty tricks' aimed at Virgin and its passengers; and using its equity
position in USAir and agreements related to it to distort competition for
passengers flying between the US and UK.
BA said last night: 'The complaint filed by Virgin in the United States . .
. is a 50-page litany of old grievances which will be appropriately dealt
with in court by our US counsel.'

FT  22 OCT 93 / Euro-sceptics set test for Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY Euro-sceptics last night used the bill paving the way for enlargement
of the European Community to test the government's commitment to clipping
the wings of Brussels bureaucracy. Mr John Biffen, MP for Shropshire North
and a former cabinet minister, urged Mr John Major to implement his 'Brixton
manifesto'.
He used Brixton because of the prime minister's association with the rundown
inner-city area of London - and the manifesto was his recent article in The
Economist newspaper underlining the importance of curbing centralism in the
EC.
Welcoming the prospect of several members of the European Free Trade
Association becoming full members of the EC, Mr Biffen described them as
being on the 'edge of Europe'. He suggested that their interests were likely
to be aligned with Britain's.
Mr Biffen looked to the government to ensure that this led to greater
recognition of the 'diversity' of the member states of the EC and a
departure from the centralisation of recent years.
Mr Tim Sainsbury, minister for industry, said the European Economic Area
bill associated six Efta states - Austria, Finland, Iceland, Liechtenstein,
Norway and Sweden - with the EC and at least four were expected to become
full members later. He forecast that the financial-services sector would be
one of the main beneficiaries of the enlargement.
The bill was given a second reading by 152 votes to nine. It later completed
its remaining stages, gaining a third reading without a vote.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Satellite decoder pirates to be pursued in courts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Sky Broadcasting and News Datacom, the 'smart card' decoder company,
said yesterday they had decided to pursue in both the civil and criminal
courts all 'hackers' producing unauthorised cards.
'Pirates are nothing more than common thieves,' BSkyB said yesterday.
The decision to take vigorous action against the pirates is a deliberate
change of policy by the satellite company and an indication that it is
taking the threat from unauthorised cards more seriously.
BSkyB, a consortium in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a
significant stake, earns 80 per cent of its revenues from subscriptions to
its scrambled channels rather than from advertis-ing.
The company said injunctions had been obtained against Hi-Tech Innovation of
Camberley, Surrey, and Mr Chris Cary, who is close-ly associated with the
company.
Permanent injunctions had been obtained against Mr Joe Ibrahim, trading as
Satellite Communications of Chorley, Lancashire, and the RSD card production
company of Stirling, Scotland, run by Mr John Ross and Mr Patrick McGrorty.
Action has also been taken against Mr Ken Ayton of Camberley, and BSkyB has
issued a writ against Mr David Lyons of Satellite Decoder Systems of
Ballyegan, Ireland, and Warrington, Cheshire.
BSkyB said yesterday that the use of pirate cards was a criminal offence and
the company was 'determined to ensure that the pirates do not succeed either
technically or economically'.
Meanwhile, Marcher Sound, the commercial radio station in north Wales, has
turned down advertising from Mr Lyons and Satellite Decoder Systems.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Mayhew toughens stance on Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yester-day poured more cold water on the Hume-Adams peace
initiative as speculation mounted on the Conservative back benches that
ministers would agree to establish a select committee on Northern Ireland.
In response to questions in the Commons, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern
Ireland secretary, appeared to harden the government's position that it
would only look afresh at policy if there was a genuine end to violence.
Sir Patrick yesterday said peace could only be secured if terrorists turned
their backs on violence for ever and not just for a ceasefire.
'To secure the peace that everyone in Northern Ireland deserves . . .
(needs) a declaration by the Provisional IRA and other terrorist groups that
the perpetration of violence is over and over for good. It is not a question
of a ceasefire and that of temporary relief.'
Details of the peace initiative have not been published, but it is
understood to envisage a cessation of violence as the start of talks on
Ulster's constitutional status.
Sir Patrick's comments were interpreted by some MPs as a signal that the
government was further distancing itself from the peace initiative created
by Mr John Hume of the Social Democratic and Labour party and Mr Gerry
Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA.
The Ulster unionists, led by Mr James Molyneaux, have rejected the
Hume-Adams proposals as 'sheer lunacy'.
The government's small majority and the continued threat of revolt has
increased its dependence on the Ulster unionists. This has fuelled
speculation that ministers may soon agree to unionist demands for a select
committee on Northern Ireland. Sir Patrick has said it is a matter for the
Commons, but it would need government support.
Sir Patrick also said that an immediate resumption of formal inter-party
talks on the future of Ulster would be 'counter-productive'.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Steady as she goes in Smith's reshuffle: Labour's leader
missed a chance to strengthen his team
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS what you might call a Majorite reshuffle: cautious, unambitious, and
carefully calculated not to upset the competing interests of different wings
of the party.
So the new line-up for Labour's shadow cabinet announced by Mr John Smith
will not signal any significant tilt in the balance of advantage between
government and opposition front benches in the House of Commons. Neither
anyway claims to be overflowing with talent.
Mr Smith can plead of course that, unlike the prime minister, a Labour
leader in opposition cannot choose his own team. The membership of the
shadow cabinet was decided earlier this week by the votes and vicissitudes
of Labour MPs. All Mr Smith was left to do was re-allocate the portfolios.
As expected the pugnacious Mr John Prescott - credited with rescuing the
leadership during last month's party conference confrontation with the
unions over internal democracy - got his reward.
Placed third in the shadow cabinet elections, his transfer to employment
gave him the economic portfolio he wanted.
Mr Frank Dobson was compensated for his switch to transport with the
additional responsibility for policy towards London. But beyond repaying his
debt to the (generally underrated) Mr Prescott, Mr Smith was anxious not to
rock too many boats.
As expected Mr Gordon Brown and Mr Tony Blair, the two leading
'modernisers', kept their portfolios as shadow chancellor and shadow home
secretary respectively. Mr Robin Cook remains at trade and industry.
By common consent at Westminster the shadow cabinet has had three crucial
weaknesses since the general election - in the posts of foreign affairs,
education and chief secretary to the Treasury. Mr Smith has decided against
remedying them.
Mr Jack Cunningham, scarcely visible since the general election as shadow
foreign secretary, retains his post in spite of a slump in his vote in this
week's elect-ions.
In the words of one of their colleagues, Mr Smith and Mr Cunningham 'go back
a long way'.
Ms Harriet Harman's televisual skills were not enough to keep her place on
the shadow cabinet. She is judged by her peers as no match for Mr Michael
Portillo as the shadow to the chief secretary to the Treasury.
But Mr Smith exercised his prerogative to keep her in place anyway, although
without a seat at the shadow cabinet table. His officials said it was a mark
of Mr Smith's political authority that he was prepared to override the views
of the parliamentary party.
Others were far from convinced, arguing that the pivotal job of shaping
Labour's approach to public spending demanded a political heavyweight. Mr
Chris Smith, wasted as the party's environment spokesman, would have been an
ideal replace-ment.
At education Mrs Ann Taylor has been similarly at sea, in spite of the open
goal offered by Mr John Patten's battles over the schools curriculum and
testing. She remains in place.
There were other curious decisions. Ms Marjorie Mowlam is deemed one of the
more effective members of the frontbench team.
But even though she same fifth in this week's poll she was moved sideways
from science and the civil service to national heritage.
Nor did Mr Smith take full advantage of Mr George Robertson's long-overdue
elevation to Labour's senior frontbench team.
The former European affairs spokesman masterminded Labour's tactics during
the protracted struggle over ratification of the Maastricht treaty. He will
be an effective shadow for Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary. But many in his
party believe Mr Robertson's talents would have been better employed in a
more wide-ranging job.
Overall, the election results and Mr Smith's limited musical chairs
reinforced the mood at the Brighton conference which put Labour's
modernisers on the defensive.
In internal debates over economic policy Mr Prescott will join Mr Cook as a
critic of Mr Brown's efforts to dump the party's remaining ideological
baggage.
The new employment spokesman is one of the most outspoken of what he terms
his party's 'beautiful people'.
The modernisers will draw from Mr Smith's approach the message that he

tendency are back in Labour's driving seat.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Supercollider rushes to its doom: Hope ends for Higgs boson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Congress yesterday finally pronounced the death sentence on the
superconducting supercollider, an Dollars 11bn (Pounds 7.2bn) particle
physics project being built in Texas.
The supercollider ' gigantic boondoggle or cutting edge science, depending
on your perspective ' often came close to losing its government funding, but
time and again it was pulled back from the edge of the grave by a handful of
powerful senators.
At last, however, it fell victim to a House-Senate conference committee's
desire for a closer match between deeds and budget-cutting rhetoric.
For two years, the House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly to kill the
supercollider, while the Senate voted to preserve it. For two years, the
conference to reconcile the two versions of the bill bowed to the Senate.
This time-honoured technique had the advantage of enabling members to tell
their constituents that they voted to cut spending, safe in the knowledge
that the project would be restored behind the conference's closed doors.
This year, however, House members revolted and sent back the reconciled bill
by an overwhelming vote of 282 to 143. Supercollider supporters, led by
Texas, where the project is sited, and Louisiana, where its giant magnets
are being built, yesterday acknowledged the inevitable.
As a consolation prize, under an agreement reached yesterday by House and
Senate negotiators, they won Dollars 640m to close the project down and pay
off its scientists ' as much as they had asked for this year to keep it
alive.
The supercollider was intended to take physics a step into the future by
accelerating proton beams around a 54 mile oval tunnel lined with magnets,
smashing them together at close to the speed of light in the hope of
producing the Higgs boson, a small particle one stage beyond the quark whose
existence is theorised.
Around Dollars 2bn has already been spent and 14 miles of tunnel have been
dug, but the supercollider's estimated completion cost had climbed rapidly
from Dollars 4.4bn in 1987 to Dollars 11bn this year.
Senator Dale Bumpers of Arkansas waged a long battle against the
supercollider, made more piquant by the fact that his foes included many of
the Senate's loudest proponents of budget austerity.
'I do not see how anybody can keep a straight face and talk about spending
cuts, then  ..vote for the supercollider. I've got a dog with a longer
memory than the US Senate,' Mr Bumpers complained.
This year, however, the Congress showed more determination to come to grips
with the US budget deficit.
Some congressional traditions are safe, nevertheless: the House-Senate
reconciliation conference on the energy and water spending bill which
contained the supercollider restored to life every other project which one
chamber or the other had voted to kill.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Warning shots off Haiti
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER

<TEXT>
A US Coast Guard cutter fired warning shots across the bow of a merchant
ship near Haiti yesterday as an international fleet enforced United Nations
sanctions against the country, Reuter reports. The merchant vessel,
registered in the Turks and Caicos Islands, left the area after the Coast
Guard fired two machine gun bursts as a warning, the US navy said.
Earlier, the fleet blockading Haiti diverted a Honduran-flagged ship, with a
cargo of motor oil, to Miami. The UN has put an embargo on fuel and weapons
shipments to Haiti to reinforce diplomatic efforts to persuade the Haitian
military to cede power to a democratic government and restore exiled
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
US, Canadian and British vessels have been sailing a few miles off Haiti to
check vessels for banned cargo. France, the Netherlands and Argentina are
sending ships to join the fleet.
Five other vessels have been intercepted and boarded off Haiti since early
Tuesday. Four were diverted but one was allowed to proceed with a cargo of
cement, which is not banned.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton confirmed yesterday that he would ask Congress to
increase the federal excise tax on a pack of cigarettes by 75 cents (49p) to
help finance his healthcare reform programme.
He maintained in a wide-ranging speech on health and social policy issues
that this tax increase (from 24 cents a pack) plus fees from employers who
opt out of the proposed federal system and savings in Medicare and Medicaid
programmes for the elderly and indigent could make possible his goal of
national health insurance for all.
He offered no estimates of projected revenue but said later the healthcare
package had been revised to take account of a higher rate of inflation
because 'economic growth has come back'.
He implied that the budgeted costs of healthcare reform now assumed a 3.5
per cent rate of inflation over the next several years, up from the 2.7 per
cent first predicated and higher than the roughly 2.5 per cent current
annual increase in retail prices .
Tough opposition can be expected from the tobacco lobby in Congress, many of
them Democrats, though the anti-smoking mood of the country is a powerful
countervailing force.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Clinton survives attempts to limit deployment of troops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton is able to breathe a little easier after the almost
complete collapse of congressional attempts to limit his authority to send
troops to Haiti and Bosnia.
The Senate was yesterday still debating  - and defeating  - a handful of
right-wing amendments on Haiti. But the die was cast the night before when
Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, accepted drastic modifications to
his proposal requiring prior congressional approval for any such missions.
Then the full chamber voted 99-1 in favour of a simple non-binding
resolution merely requesting that the President seek such approval for any
Bosnian deployment.
Mr Clinton had survived a similar challenge over Somalia last week and on
Tuesday the Senate voted down a proposal requiring that US forces serving in
UN peacekeeping operations always be subject to US military command.
Yesterday Ms Dee Dee Myers, the president's press secretary, reported that
he was 'very pleased' that his authority had been sustained on all fronts.
The White House also released a letter sent by Mr Clinton to Congress on
Wednesday justifying the naval cordon around Haiti under the terms of the
1973 War Powers Act. This mandates congressional approval within 90 days of
the dispatch of US troops to 'actual or imminent' hostile situations.
Mr Dole continued to insist that he was not simply playing political games
over Haiti and Bosnia, though this is the prevalent view in Washington. The
Senator, who had earlier admitted he would oppose his own original amendment
if he were president, said he only wanted to construct 'a political flak
jacket,' not 'a straight jacket', for the commander-in-chief.
Mr Clinton, with an eye on big domestic battles ahead tactfully praised Mr
Dole for his co-operation.
The protracted political debate, however, had given full airing to
reservations about the current conduct of US foreign policy. Some opinions
were predictably extreme. Senator Jesse Helms, the Republican from North
Carolina whose backing of right-wing nationalist causes overseas has always
been staunch, took to the Senate floor to brand Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide,
the ousted Haitian president, as a 'psychopath.'
More reasoned debate concerned exactly what the US was trying to do to
effect Mr Aristide's return, scheduled for the end of this month under the
terms of a United Nations-brokered peace plan, but now clearly in grave
doubt. The White House was, for example, obliged to deny that a proposal put
to Mr Robert Malval, the pre-democracy prime minister, for an expanded
cabinet was intended to give the Haitian military and police a share in
power in a resumed Aristide presidency.
The proposal, put over the weekend by Mr Dante Caputo, the UN mediator,
upset both Mr Malval and Mr Aristide. US spokesmen insisted that the idea
was to get on board the business and landowning classes that have supported
the military, but that 'it will absolutely not include' military and police
officials nor known backers of Haiti's earlier Duvalier regimes.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Canadian voters look to Reform: Populist or extremist, it
could go from one Commons seat to as many as 50
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT is no small achievement for a politician to draw 4,000 people to an
election rally in suburban Toronto on the same night that the Toronto Blue
Jays are playing the Philadelphia Phillies in the World Series baseball
championship.
Mr Preston Manning did just that on Tuesday. The crowd which packed the
Pickering Trade Centre, east of Toronto, was further evidence that Mr
Manning's populist, right-of-centre Reform party will be a big winner in
next Monday's general election.
If opinion polls and political pundits are correct, Reform's presence in the
House of Commons in Ottawa will soar from a lone member representing a
remote Alberta constituency, to as many as 50 or more MPs from all five
provinces west of Quebec.
With a large number of three- and four-way races, the precise breakdown of
seats is unusually difficult to predict. But the ruling Progressive
Conservatives, led by Ms Kim Campbell, the prime minister, have stumbled so
badly in the seven-week campaign that few analysts will be surprised if
Reform or the separatist Bloc Quebecois ends up as the official opposition.
The Liberals, currently the main opposition party, are almost certain to
form the next government. It is not yet clear however, whether they will win
enough seats for an outright majority.
The bulk of Reform's support has come from unhappy Conservatives in western
Canada. But the fledgling party, formed in 1987, has also become an outlet
for disaffected Liberals, and even for members of the left-of-centre New
Democratic party, which is expected to be virtually annihilated in the
election.
Reform is a peculiar political party. In one sense, it is little more than a
protest movement. The typical Reform supporter is a disgruntled
English-speaking Canadian who is fed up with high taxes, immigrants
(especially refugees), early parole for criminals, affirmative action and
gay rights.
Reform has also become a rallying point for Canadians in Ontario and the
west who think the time has come to stand up to Quebec. The Reform view is
that if Quebec refuses to accept the same constitutional powers as the other
nine provinces and decides to go its own way, so be it.
But Reform has also won wider respect by presenting the campaign's most
detailed and fearless platform, including a plan to eliminate Ottawa's
yawning CDollars 35bn (Pounds 17.2bn) budget deficit within three years.
It has had the guts to acknowledge that chopping the deficit would involve
some painful choices. The Reform platform pledges a radical overhaul of such
sacred cows of Canadian society as unemployment insurance, social welfare
and universal healthcare.
Mr Manning is often compared with Mr Ross Perot, the US populist
billionaire. Aged 51, the son of a former premier of Alberta, he has the
same clean-cut appearance and preaches the same traditional values as Mr
Perot.
Among his hobbies listed in Who's Who are shopping, fishing and horse-riding
with his family.
Although somewhat less cocky, Mr Manning shares Mr Perot's knack for
presenting seductively simple solutions to complex problems. One of his
favourite lines is that 'the best thing the government can do for Canadians
is to get off their backs and get out of their pockets.'
But, like Mr Perot's movement in the US, the Reform party's uncomplicated
view of the world makes many Canadians uneasy.
Critics note that the 'zero-in-three' deficit-elimination plan would be
impossible to implement without a huge jump in unemployment (already at over
11 per cent) and severe cuts in government services.
Its uncompromising attitude towards Quebec and its intolerance towards
rising immigration clash with values which up to now have been hallmarks of
Canadian society.
Other than Mr Manning and Ms Deborah Grey, Reform's sole MP, little is known
about its candidates. While Mr Manning comes across as a decent and honest
politician, there is considerable evidence that his party has become a haven
for more extreme elements.
Earlier this month, Mr Manning hurriedly dismissed a Reform candidate in
southern Ontario who made racist and anti-Semitic remarks. Other candidates
are reported to have expressed similar views.
Mr Manning insists that such views are not Reform policy nor typical of most
of its candidates or members. He told the crowd in Pickering: 'We refuse to
be influenced by the racists of the right, and refuse to be intimidated by
the fanatics of political correctness on the left.'
No matter how well it fares on Monday, Reform's base is far from secure. Its
support appeared to be ebbing earlier this year before Ms Campbell and her
advisers drove the Conservatives' electoral machine into the ditch. An
improving economy could see many Reform supporters drift back to the
Conservative, Liberal or NDP folds.
Even in the closing days of the campaign, concern about Reform's policies
and candidates appears to have made some voters think twice.
Furthermore, the inexperience of Reform's new MPs could make them an easy
target in the new Parliament. Mr Manning's plan to loosen party discipline
in the House of Commons and make MPs more accountable to their constituents
runs the risk of weakening party unity.
While Reform is not yet firmly entrenched in the mainstream of Canadian
politics, it could be a formidable force on the opposition benches. At the
very least, it will long be remembered for putting a firecracker under
Canada's traditional political parties.

FT  22 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Computer makers seek window of opportunity
 -US companies are targeting Japanese schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE US trade negotiators in Tokyo this week try to convinceJapan to buy
more high-tech goods from foreign companies, they will also be keeping a
keen eye on the fortunes of one key US industry which will be affected by
public purchasing decisions.
US computer companies are gearing up to sell their wares to Japanese
schools, which are expected to buy hundreds of thousands of PCs over the
next few years as part of a government-sponsored programme to raise the
level of computer education in the country.
The US government will no doubt be watching their progress carefully. Mr
Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, noted on Wednesday that US computer
makers had been 'locked out' of the Japanese public procurement market for
computers.
And the education market is one conspicuous public procurement sector in
Japan where US PC makers have had little success.
When Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, came to Japan in late April, he made
a point of visiting Apple's offices in Tokyo and indicating that he wanted
to see US companies sell more PCs to Japanese schools. High-technology
products such as PCs are priority items on the list of goods the US is keen
to sell to Japan.
The expected PC-buying binge in the months ahead provides US computer
companies such as Apple and IBM, with a big opportunity to penetrate the
Japanese schools market. It stems from a decision by the Japanese government
to boost purchases of PCs for schools as a key part of its economic stimulus
package announced in the spring.
If schools take up the government's offer as they are expected to, Japan's
educational market for PCs is likely to double in 1994, says Mr Hector
Saldana director of strategic sales at Apple Japan.
The aim of both IBM and Apple is to double their share of the market over
the next few years.
But in common with all market sectors on that list, the Japanese public
schools market, which has been dominated by domestic makers such as NEC and
Fujitsu, is hardly an easy one to crack.
Industry estimates give NEC a 50-60 per cent share of the educational
market, with Fujitsu coming in second at 25 per cent, while the share of US
companies is minimal.
Lack of user familiarity with foreign products, an emphasis on relationships
rather than quality and price, and above all local politics, all doom the
foreign vendor in the Japanese public schools market as much as they affect
decisions in other areas of government procurement.
While IBM and Apple are working hard to win over teachers and education
authorities by visiting schools it is often the local politicians, rather
than the people who will be actually using the machines, who make the final
decision.
For public schools, the local educational authority, staffed by civil
servants and heavily influenced by local politics, makes the procurement
decisions.
'The officials in the local educational authority are not the ones who will
use the computer,' Mr Hideaki Sekine, general manager of educational systems
operations at IBM Japan, says regretfully.
'The process of how decisions are made tends to be heavily influenced by
politics, and if not by written policies, by practices which favour local
vendors,' says Mr Saldana. .
A few months ago, Apple had the recommendation of a school board in Sakai,
outside Osaka, to buy Apple computers overturned at the final point by the
local education board, on the basis of a 10 per cent price difference.
Although the school board said it still favoured Apple, the contract went to
NEC.
Mr Saldana prefers not to complain too much, however. He is confident that
if Apple has the right products and the right policies it can improve its
position in the market significantly.
But he does ask that the Japanese government ensure that the market is a
fair one. 'Apple is a foreign company and doesn't have a lobbying
mechanism,' Mr Saldana says. 'The only thing we can ask of the central
government is to make sure the process is fair.'

<TEXT>
JAPANESE officials yesterday made a last-minute attempt to avert sanctions
which the US is threatening to impose on Japan unless it agrees to open its
construction market in line with US demands.
The chiefs of four of Japan's ministries concerned with the construction
issue met yesterday in an effort to come up with a proposal that would
reform key aspects of Japan's public works bidding system.
At an emergency meeting yesterday evening, Mr Tsutomu Hata, foreign
minister, Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, Mr Kozo Igarashi,
construction minister and Mr Kanju Sato, home affairs minister, discussed
reforms which Japan could present to the US ahead of the November 1 deadline
after which sanctions would be imposed.
The four agreed that Japan needed to increase competitiveness and
transparency in its bidding system.
In a speech to US business executives on Wednesday, Mr Mickey Kantor, the US
trade representative, said that sanctions appeared to be 'the only way the
Japanese will seriously address this issue'.
The US has been threatening sanctions unless Japan reforms its public works
bidding system in line with four principles outlined by the US to Japan: to
introduce an open and competitive bidding system, to apply that system to
all projects above a certain level, to strengthen anti-monopoly rules and to
enhance data collection to assess progress in achieving those goals.
Japanese officials refuse to accept the US deadline, which they claim was
set unilaterally and without warning.
However, there is a growing recognition that Japan will have to face up to
international pressure to bring its bidding system in line with that of
other industrialised countries.
Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the Gatt, yesterday met leading
Japanese politicians, including Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, but met
with continued resistance to the idea of tarification of rice - turning
quantitive restrictions into tariffs - from minister of agriculture,
forestry and fisheries, Mr Eijiro Hata.
The Japanese authorities are considering a number of proposals for the
liberalisation of the rice market which would modify the Dunkel text
proposal for tarification.

steps up campaign on pact with aid for affected communities

<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration will soon announce support for a North American
Development Bank, which would fund projects in communities hit by job losses
resulting from the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The so-called NADBank has been strongly supported by Congressman Esteban
Torres, who has insisted on some sort of lending institution to support
adjustment throughout the continent. Agreement by the administration is
expected to bring Mr Torres and at least 7 other Hispanic congressmen into
the pro-Nafta fold.
The administration believes it can garner 200-210 pro-Nafta votes, out of
the 218 needed. It is assuming that every undecided congressman only wants a
reason - favourable constituent mail - to vote for the pact, and it is
pushing feverishly to turn anti-Nafta public opinion around.
The White House 'war room' believes the vote currently breaks down into 110
Republicans in favour, 65-75 Democrats in favour; and 20-30 leaning towards
it. Under this hopeful scenario, the White House will use the last few days
before the November 17 House vote to cajole, bargain and twist arms to get
the remaining 8 votes.
However the anti-Nafta forces expect a different outcome. They count 190-200
Democrats against, 10-15 Democrats leaning against, and 5-10 Republicans
opposed.
The pro-Nafta campaign this week began moving into high gear. State by
state, undecided congressmen are being lured to the White House for intimate
briefings, as are business leaders and journalists.
Members of the cabinet are being sent to congressional districts, where they
visit and publicise factories that are expected to gain jobs if Nafta
passes.
President Bill Clinton on Wednesday gave his second impassioned speech on
Nafta at an exhibit on the White House lawn of products likely to benefit
from Nafta. He envisioned continent-wide free trade 'when we'll have over
700m people in this trading bloc, united in believing that we can help one
another grow and flourish,' he said.
The Nafta opposition has been just as busy. Across town, the AFL-CIO trade
union grouping on Wednesday had its own products exhibit, but those were
likely to be hurt by Nafta. The speakers were workers who had lost their
jobs when their employers moved to Mexico.

CHRYSLER, the US vehicle maker, announced yesterday that Steyr-Daimler-Puch

The vehicles will be made at the plant in Graz, Austria, where Steyr has

The Cherokee production line will start late next year.
The move marks a further push into Europe by Chrysler, which unlike its
Detroit rivals Ford and GM, has no manufacturing presence in the region.
However, Chrysler is keen to expand there to help offset future downturns in
the US market.
Its European sales jumped 48 per cent to 17,130 vehicles in the third
quarter.

Nafta has hindered progress on the Uruguay Round of trade talks, divided

FT  22 OCT 93 / World Trade News: US and EC blame each other over tariff
cuts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TRADE negotiators in Geneva said yesterday talks on tariff reduction between
the leading trading nations were making little progress, with the US and the
EC blaming each other  - and to a lesser extent Japan  - for the deadlock.
Mr John Schmidt, chief US negotiator in the Uruguay Round of global trade
talks, described the state of the negotiations between the Quad nations  -
the US, EC, Japan and Canada  - as 'stagnant'. Noting that the latest EC
tariff offer was still below the average level achieved by the other Quad
partners, he said its meagre market access proposals for farm goods
threatened to block an overall tariff package by the agreed date of November
15.
EC officials counter-attacked yesterday, arguing that US tariff proposals
fell far short of reduction commitments made by the Quad countries in Tokyo
last July. Brussels says it is prepared to improve on its offer tabled this
week, which amounts to an average one-third cut in tariffs, but cannot do so
politically without further US concessions,
These are unlikely to be forthcoming soon, EC officials added, because
senior Washington officials are giving priority to getting the North
American Free Trade Agreement through Congress,
Comparative figures produced by Brussels yesterday show that the EC already
has fewer industrial tariff peaks (duties of 15 per cent or more) than its
Quad partners, at lower rates and covering a smaller volume of trade. On the
peaks themselves, weighted by the amount of trade, the EC is offering a 37
per cent average cut against 36 per cent for Canada, 26 per cent for Japan
and just 7.3 per cent for the US.
These figures exclude chemicals which are covered by a harmonisation
proposal and would make the US offer look better, and fish, on which the EC
has so far made no offer, which would make the EC proposal look worse.

sanctions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
JAPANESE officials yesterday made a last-minute attempt to avert sanctions
which the US is threatening to impose on Japan unless it agrees to open its
construction market in line with US demands.
The chiefs of four of Japan's ministries concerned with the construction
issue met yesterday in an effort to come up with a proposal that would
reform key aspects of Japan's public works bidding system.
At an emergency meeting yesterday evening, Mr Tsutomu Hata, foreign
minister, Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, Mr Kozo Igarashi,
construction minister and Mr Kanju Sato, home affairs minister, discussed
reforms which Japan could present to the US ahead of the November 1 deadline
after which sanctions would be imposed.
The four agreed that Japan needed to increase competitiveness and
transparency in its bidding system.
The move is likely to reinforce the impression that the threat of sanctions
is necessary to trigger change in Japanese business and government
practices.
In a speech to US business executives on Wednesday, Mr Mickey Kantor, the US
trade representative, said that sanctions appeared to be 'the only way the
Japanese will seriously address this issue'.
The US has been threatening sanctions unless Japan reforms its public works
bidding system in line with four principles outlined by the US to Japan: to
introduce an open and competitive bidding system, to apply that system to
all projects above a certain level, to strengthen anti-monopoly rules and to
enhance data collection to assess progress in achieving those goals.
Japanese officials refuse to accept the US deadline, which they claim was
set unilaterally and without warning.
However, there is a growing recognition that Japan will have to face up to
international pressure to bring its bidding system in line with that of
other industrialised countries.
Recognition of that need is also growing as the deadline nears for the
conclusion of the Uruguay Round negotiations on global trade liberalisation.
Japan's offer in the Uruguay Round negotiations on opening up the public
procurement market for construction services is also out of line with the
offer made by other members such as the US and EC, officials said. Mr Peter
Sutherland, director-general of the Gatt, yesterday met leading Japanese
politicians, including Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, but met with
continued resistance to the idea of tarification  - turning quantitive
restrictions into tariffs  - of rice from minister of agriculture, forestry
and fisheries, Mr Eijiro Hata.
The Japanese authorities are considering a number of proposals for the
liberalisation of the rice market which would modify the Dunkel text
proposal for tarification.

MR JOHN CAHILL, chairman of British Aerospace, failed yesterday to agree on
a date to restart stalled talks on a joint venture to build regional jet
aircraft in Taiwan. Another effort will be made this morning just hours
ahead of his scheduled departure.
Meetings with government ministers and Mr Earle Hou, chairman of Taiwan
Aerospace Corporation (TAC), BAe's joint venture partner, appeared to have
left a decision over the deal as far away as ever. Failure would be a blow
to Mr Cahill's plans to improve BAe's performance. The regional jet business
loses money and the company has not made a full-year pre-tax profit since
1990.
Taiwan's government also wants the deal to go ahead as part of a policy to
bring the island engineering industries into the civil aviation sector.
The proposals to build BAe's RJ range of regional jets in Taiwan in return
for a cash injection of at least Pounds 120m has hit opposition from
Taiwanese politicians, bankers and industrialists who argue that it is
uncommercial and too ambitious.
Mr Needham yesterday reiterated the UK government's support for the deal but
said the decision should be taken by BAe and TAC.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COMMONWEALTH leaders yesterday opened their five-day summit in Cyprus,
stressing the urgent need for a new international trade agreement and
reaffirming their commitment to human rights.
Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating used his first appearance at the
forum to make an attack, clearly aimed at France, on countries holding up
progress in the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks, while leaving
no doubt his country's move to republican status would not undermine its
Commonwealth ties.
In a speech designed to refocus the 50-member association in the wake of
apartheid's demise, Chief Emeka Anyaoku, its secretary-general, made trade
reform a priority.
He linked the outcome of the Uruguay Round talks to efforts to promote
democracy within the Commonwealth and elsewhere. 'Like armies, democracies
march on their stomachs. The successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round
promises an annual addition to global income of Dollars 213bn by the year
2002,' Chief Anyaoku told the heads of government.
'Yet that crucial step now looks uncertain, threatening not merely the loss
of the huge potential gains but a spiralling descent into protectionism and
isolationism.'
Mr Keating's contribution was the first stage in a co-ordinated effort by
Australia and Britain to enlist support for trade reform from an association
whose membership spans Francophone Africa, the Cairns group and many of the
world's poorest countries.
Taking the offensive in the opening session, Mr Keating warned: 'Time is
very short for us to prevent the Round's collapse.' Clearly referring to
France, he went on: 'Some 'rich countries' still seem to believe they can
avoid making difficult concessions but still reap the advantages of the
Round. I think they are completely wrong, and are likely to bear the
opprobrium and contumely of the whole world.'
Mr John Major, UK prime minister, made the issue the centre of his
contribution later in the day, when the conference went into closed session.
He echoed Mr Keating's call on Commonwealth leaders to 'make every effort to
examine what the Commonwealth can do to help bring about an outcome from the
Multilateral Trade Negotiations to benefit each of us and the world at
large.'
Mr Major also highlighted the problem of third world debt, conceding that
more needed to be done to ease the burden on developing countries. In
particular, he called for rapid implementation of the Trinidad terms, which
provide for a write-off of 50 per cent of official debt.
But he went further by holding out the prospect of improved Trinidad terms.
'The neediest countries, with a track record of economic reform, should be
granted two-thirds debt reduction on their whole stock of official debt,' he
said. 'In some cases this should be a high as 80 per cent.'
Mr Major added that in all too many places 'the age of the warlord is
returning', placing greater demands on the Commonwealth and the UN. But
objectives must be realistic and linked to a political process. 'What we
cannot do, we should not pretend to do. But what we decide to do, we must do
well.'

FT  22 OCT 93 / Israel agrees to phased release of Palestinians

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL and the Palestine Liberation Organisation confirmed last night that
there would be a phased release of Palestinians held in Israeli jails, but
gave no indication of how many people would be involved.
The announcement came after peace negotiators had clashed angrily over the
issue and on Israeli security proposals for the interim five-year period of
Palestinian self-rule.
At one point, the Palestinian delegation, led by Mr Nabil Shaath, walked out
of talks in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba, saying they had hit a
crisis over the prisoners issue, but it later returned.
'The release of prisoners will be implemented gradually and continually,'
Palestinian delegate Jaber Fada said last night, reading a joint statement
to reporters.
'As a first step, it was decided that prisoners belonging to the following
categories (should be released) by the beginning of next week,' he added.
Those listed included the sick, those under 18, those over 50, and women.
A leading supporter of Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, was assassinated in
Gaza City yesterday, bringing the number of political killings to three
since the outline peace accord was signed.
The killing of Mr Asaad Saftawi, a moderate, has fuelled fears of mounting
assassinations and political conflict as various Palestinian factions
compete.
At the Taba talks, the Palestinians have been seeking immediate and
unconditional release of up to 14,000 prisoners and want speedy gestures of
goodwill by Israel to show to Palestinian opponents of the peace agreement.
The talks have also hit a snag on security. Israel has presented a
comprehensive security plan to the Palestinians calling for an Israeli
military presence of about 4,000 troops in the Gaza Strip after the Israelis
are supposed to have completed military withdrawal by April 13.
The Israelis are insisting on providing security for up to 5,000 Jewish
settlers in the Gaza Strip to give them freedom of movement and protect them
against external threats. They also insist Israeli police will have the
right to chase Palestinian assailants into the Palestinian-controlled areas
and establish buffer security zones.
Members of the Palestinian delegation were outraged by the Israeli security
plans. The Palestinians have proposed a complete Israeli withdrawal, with
only small numbers of Israeli troops to protect the settlers.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Troops overthrow Burundi president

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PARATROOPERS of the minority Tutsi tribe yesterday overthrew President
Melchior Ndadaye of Burundi, ending a short-lived experiment in democracy
which had given the majority Hutu tribe a rare taste of political freedom.
There was confusion last night over whether the president was dead or alive.
State radio in neighbouring Rwanda reported that Mr Ndadaye and three senior
government officials may have been executed. But according to Radio Burundi
he was taken prisoner and held at an army barracks. Rwanda state radio said
the army had imposed a state of emergency and a dusk-to-dawn curfew.
Diplomats in Nairobi said they feared a bloodbath in the central African
state, scarred by tribal massacres since independence from Belgium in 1962.
Mr Ndadaye, a Hutu, took office in July after winning Burundi's first
multi-party elections. His victory appeared to mark the end of 31 years of
Tutsi domination, although he was careful to include members of the minority
tribe in his government. The army remained under Tutsi control.
Speaking from a hideout, Mr Jean-Marie Ngedahayo, the deposed government's
spokesman, told Radio Rwanda the president had been lured into a trap by the
coup plotters. Paratroops from the 2nd Parachute Battalion surrounded the
presidential palace at midnight, he said. There was a brief exchange of
gunfire, but soldiers loyal to the government were quickly overwhelmed.
The paratroops fanned out across the capital in search of congressmen and
government ministers.
'All the other leaders of the new Burundi have gone into hiding. Our
telephones have been cut. We are using makeshift gadgets and do not know how
long we will stay in contact with the outside world and friends,' Mr
Ngedahayo said. City centres were deserted. A few demonstrations in favour
of Mr Ndadaye outside the town centre had been suppressed by soldiers, he
said.
The European Community strongly condemned the coup and pledged support for
Mr Ndadaye. In Nairobi, Mr Joseph Banguranbona, Burundian ambassador, called
on the international community to intervene militarily and restore
democracy. 'This is a coup against democracy. There will be bloodshed if the
military consolidate power. The west can't allow this.'
The Tutsi, feudal overlords before colonial days, took control of government
and army after independence, though they made up less than 15 per cent of
Burundi's 5.6m people. The Hutu were victims of periodic massacres. In 1972,
about 100,000 people, mainly Hutu, were killed. In August 1988 Hutu farmers
staged an uprising in which 5,000 people died.
Mr Ndadaye survived the anti-Hutu slaughters in 1972 by fleeing to Rwanda.
He returned in 1983 when ex-President Jean Baptiste Bagaza, said to be one
of the coup leaders, was still in power.

<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of angry workers from Israel Aircraft Industries, Israel's largest
employer, blocked runways and disrupted flights at Tel Aviv international
airport yesterday, in protest at government plans to lay off workers at the
loss-making state-owned defence company, writes Julian Ozanne.
Police said 5,000-6,000 workers shut the airport for three hours, stopping
13 outgoing flights and forcing three incoming aircraft to be diverted. The
action was part of a campaign against plans to restructure IAI, which
employs 17,320 people.
The company makes military and civilian aircraft, radar systems, and medical
and law-enforcement equipment, and is involved in the troubled Arrow
anti-tactical ballistic missile project. It had a turnover of Dollars 1.57bn
(Pounds 1.03bn) last year, mostly from exports, but posted a loss of Dollars
60m.
A revised government recovery plan calls for a 4,000 cut in the workforce,
and a 15 per cent cut in wages. Prime minister Yitzhak Rabin has warned
workers that if the recovery plan is not carried out, IAI will collapse.
The government, he said, was ready to invest in and subsidise IAI but only
when it got back to work and introduced measures to boost efficiency and
implement a recovery plan. The finance ministry says the government has
already injected Sh750m (Pounds 172m) into IAI but the company has not
responded by dismissing workers, cutting wages and increasing sales.
The company says it only received a Dollars 100m state guarantee and Dollars
22.5m of government participation in retirement packages. Government
officials have warned that continuing disruption of IAI could force the
company into receivership.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Five on trial in Singapore secrets case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EDITOR of Singapore's leading financial newspaper, one of his
journalists and three prominent economists went on trial yesterday, charged
under the Official Secrets Act with illegally disclosing Singapore's
economic growth figure.
The case is seen as an indicator of the present level of press freedom in
Singapore. In a rare appearance in a district court, Attorney-General Chan
Sek Keong charged Business Times (BT) editor Patrick Daniel with breaching
the act by receiving the data and 'communicating' the information to
readers.
Mr Chan said a top government economist illegally revealed a preliminary
projection of a quarterly economic growth figure, known as a 'flash
estimate,' to a private economist who then passed it on to a BT journalist.
Part of the reason he was personally prosecuting the case was to maintain
and establish 'an important principle.
'It is that persons who have been entrusted with classified information of
whatever nature in their official duties must keep them secret.'
Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, director of the economic department of the
Monetary Authority of Singapore, the de facto central bank, is accused of
communicating the figure to Mr Manu Bhaskaran, an economist at the regional
brokerage Crosby Securities. The other defendants are Mr Daniel, BT
journalist Mr Kenneth James, and another Crosby economist, Mr Raymond Foo.
The five pleaded not guilty.
The charges stem from an investigation by Singapore's Internal Security
Department (ISD) into a June 29 BT article which accurately forecast
second-quarter economic growth of 4.6 per cent. An official announcement was
made only in August.
Mr Bhaskaran and Mr Foo are charged with three counts of possessing and
communicating the data. Mr Daniel and Mr James, a Malaysian, face two
charges each of possessing, disseminating and publishing the data on June
29. A conviction for each charge carries a maximum penalty of two years in
jail and a SDollars 2,000 (Pounds 836) fine.
Singapore has other controls on the press. An act gives the government
control over the board of directors of any locally-published newspaper and
lets it revoke a paper's licence to operate. The government has curbed
circulation of several foreign publications involved in disputes with it.
Invoking the Official Secrets Act has reinforced a widespread belief that,
in spite of Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong's protestations that he is trying
to create a kinder Singapore, anything which smacks of insubordination is
liable to be pounced on.
Mr Lee Kwan Yew, former premier, has suggested reporters would not have had
the temerity to publish government figures ahead of schedule when he was
prime minister. He said journalists were testing Mr Goh.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Russia bows to Japan pressure on dumping

THE RUSSIAN government yesterday bowed to Japanese pressure and said it had
abandoned its plans to release more nuclear waste into the seas around
Japan.
However, it warned that unless Russia received international help to build a
Rs10bn factory to process the waste within the next 18 months, it would be
forced to start dumping again.
Japan yesterday welcomed the decision and said it would press for a world
ban on ocean dumping of low-level material.
Russia's decision came in response to a late-night telephone call by Mr
Tsutomu Hata, the Japanese foreign minister, to Mr Andrei Kozyrev, his
Russian counterpart.
Mr Hata demanded that Russia cancel plans to dump a second load of waste,
after the first load of 900 cu metres of liquid radioactive waste was dumped
on Sunday, or risk souring recently improved relations.
'The Russian government has. . . made a political decision on the immediate
halting of that dumping and the government of Japan values this point,' said
Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary.
The dumping of coolant and cleansing water from decommissioned nuclear
submarines sparked an outcry among environmentally sensitive Japanese.
It also threatened to increase popular distrust of Russia, coming less than
a week after Russian president Boris Yeltsin's visit to Tokyo.
Japanese officials in Tokyo said that Japan was considering calling for an
complete international ban on nuclear waste-dumping at sea.
Japan has said it will consider releasing some of the Dollars 100m (Pounds
66.2m) it has offered to help Russia disarm its nuclear weapons.
Russia has repeatedly warned that its economic crisis has left it with
little alternative to dumping waste at sea to dispose of its huge stocks of
radioactive waste.
But in a defiant note, Mr Viktor Danilov-Danilyan, Russian environment
minister, yesterday insisted that the international outrage over the dumping
had been exaggerated.
'It's a question of priorities. We can't dispose of waste in a region with
millions of people,' he said, admitting that he had been taken aback by the
strength of protests from Japan, America and South Korea.
He added: 'I have to deal with worse ecological problems (in Russia)'.
A team of Russian experts is due to travel to Japan to discuss collaboration
over the issue, which is expected to include specific Japanese aid to build
the processing factory, Russian officials added.
Japan has despatched a research vessel to measure radiation off the northern
coast, and plans to call for a complete ban on dumping of low-level waste at
a future meeting of the London convention on nuclear waste disposal at sea.
The convention bans dumping of high-level waste and contains a voluntary
resolution, signed by neither Japan nor Russia, against the dumping of
low-level waste.

MR VA JAFFERY, a former governor of Pakistan's central bank with a
reputation for financial discipline in government spending, was among six
ministers and advisers yesterday appointed to the cabinet of Ms Benazir
Bhutto, Pakistan's prime minister.
Although there is speculation that Ms Bhutto would keep the finance and
commerce portfolios herself, Mr Jaffery's appointment as an adviser was seen
as an encouraging signal that serious measures would be taken to reverse a
large budgetary deficit.
Mr Jaffery said the government would take steps to cut spending on expensive
programmes begun under the government of Mr Nawaz Sharif, the former prime
minister.
Those include projects for building motorways, and schemes for importing a
large number of taxi cabs, which were backed by huge loans from
government-owned banks.
Pakistan's last fiscal year closed in June with a record high budgetary
deficit of 7 per cent of gross domestic product, substantially lager than
the target recommended by the IMF, the World bank and bilateral aid donors.
Mr Jaffery said the new government would try to bring the deficit down to
5.4 per cent of GDP by the end of the current fiscal year. He also said most
wide-ranging economic reforms begun by Mr Moeen Qureshi, the interim prime
minister, would remain in force.
Mr Naseerullah Babar, a retired general and member of Ms Bhutto's Pakistan
People's Party (PPP), was sworn in as interior minister.
She allocated portfolios to three members of other parties in her coalition
government, giving parliamentary affairs to Sher Afghan Niazi, an
independent elected with PPP support in the October 6 general election.
Mr Mohammad Asghar, a retired brigadier and senior member of her main allied
party  - a splinter group of ex-premier Nawaz Sharif's Pakistan Muslim
League  - became minister of industries and production.
Mr Mohammad Afzal Khan, of a small party from the North West Frontier
Province, was also sworn in. His portfolio was to be announced later.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Two arrested as construction scandal widens

JAPAN'S construction industry scandal widened yesterday when prosecutors
arrested two branch executives of Kajima, one of the country's top
contractors, on suspicions of bribery.
This means prosecutors have arrested executives from all of Japan's top six
contractors, suspected of paying bribes to get local government building
contracts. Kajima is Japan's second largest construction group in sales, but
is the most politically influential, thanks to the many former government
officials it employs.
Mr Akira Miyazaki, Kajima's president, yesterday said he believed the pair
had made illegal political donations, but head office was not involved.
Prosecutors also raided the home of a Kajima vice-president to gather
evidence.
The latest arrests add fresh weight to US allegations that the Japanese
construction market is rigged against foreign competition. They come in the
final weeks before the US-imposed November 1 deadline after which Washington
has threatened to apply trade sanctions against Japan unless the
construction market is made more open.
Washington's main complaint is against the designated bidding system,
whereby a local government chooses companies suitable to tender for a
contract. Companies not designated have no right to bid.
This is blamed as a factor in the kind of corruption of which Kajima is
suspected. Legal and illicit construction industry donations are a
traditionally large source of political campaign funds.
The two Kajima branch managers arrested, Kazumi Suzuki and Ichiro Takagi,
are suspected of handing Y10m to the former mayor of the northern town of
Sendai, Mr Toru Ishii, last year. Mr Ishii has already been charged with
receiving bribes from four other contractors, Shimizu, the industry leader,
Hazama, Nishimatsu Construction and Mitsui Construction. A senior executive
of Taisei, another construction group, has also been held.
'This just shows how endemic the construction industry problem has become,'
said Mr Graeme McDonald, analyst at James Capel Pacific.
As in previous arrests, the Kajima inquiry is based on evidence gathered
from the papers of Mr Shin Kanemaru, former political godfather of the
Liberal Democratic Party.
His arrest in March on charges of tax evasion on donations from the
construction industry contributed to the LDP's election defeat after 38
years in power.

<TEXT>
THE decision by the Bundesbank to cut key lending rates defused tensions
within the European exchange rate mechanism as investors anticipated lower
interest rates throughout continental Europe.
The news sparked rises in the French franc and Danish krone against the
D-Mark. Shortly afterwards Switzerland and Belgium also cut key rates.
The French franc rose two centimes to FFr3.5120 to the D-Mark from FFr3.5320
at the close of European dealing on Wednesday.
Many economists believe the French government will take advantage of its
currency's strength and cut rates over the next few days.
In spite of its rate cut yesterday, Belgium was considered by many investors
to be suffering problems that need far more than a small easing in borrowing
conditions. An initial lift for the Belgian franc from the German rate cut
was offset by news that some unions had pulled out of negotiations on the
country's social pact on wages and unemployment.
It fell back to just below BFr21.80. But, later in the day, the Belgian
National Bank cut its key interest rate to 9.4 per cent from 9.65 per cent
and its discount rate by half a point to 6 per cent. The currency recovered
to close at BFr21.67 to the D-Mark, up from BFr21.82 previously.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, currency analyst with Citibank was sceptical of the
effect the cut would have on both the French and Belgian currencies. 'The
best you can say about the Bundesbank cut is that it provides a breathing
space but the scale of reductions needed in Belgium and France are much
greater than a German reduction allows.'
Denmark, languishing at the bottom of the European Monetary System and
maintaining high rates while inflation is only about 1 per cent, was
expected to cut its official 14-day rate to 8 per cent from 8.5 per cent.
The Danish Krone rose to DKr4.0255 to the D-Mark from DKr4.0592. Meanwhile,
the Swiss National Bank cut its discount rate to 4.25 per cent from 4.50 per
cent.
The main beneficiary in currency markets was the US dollar which will offer
a relatively stronger return as the difference between US and German
short-term rates narrows. Short-term speculators sold D-Marks to buy the
dollar, pushing it up by nearly two pfennigs to DM1.6635, against DM1.6450
previously. The pound surged two pfennigs to DM2.4725, from DM2.45
previously.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Dutch praise for caution on rates

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Wim Duisenberg, the president of the Netherlands National Bank, last
night stressed that yesterday's cuts in Bundesbank and other European
interest rates did not represent any change in the cautious monetary
policies of continental central banks.
Addressing a group of international monetary policy makers and academics, Mr
Duisenberg castigated 'Anglo-Saxon commentators' for failing to understand
that sharp cuts in short-term interest rates would not boost the
recession-hit member countries of the European exchange rate mechanism.
Mr Duisenberg, who is also chairman of the European Community's central bank
governors' committee, said attempts to force down short-term interest rates
aggressively 'might very well stir up inflationary expectations again' and
result in higher rather than lower long-term interest rates.
Long-term rates were 'far more important for investment and growth than
short-term rates' among ERM member states, he said. 'In the short run,
changes in short-term interest rates in continental Europe do not have a
large impact on the disposable income of consumers and enterprises.' Such
effects as there were only appeared after a long time lag.
Mr Duisenberg underlined that monetary stability in a European context meant
more than price stability. It also meant exchange rate stability.
'This is a fact I cannot over-emphasise,' he said. 'Sometimes, the crucial
notion of exchange rate stability as an essential foundation of the
functioning of the single internal European market is strongly
underestimated. In the very open and highly interdependent continental
European economies, ex-change rate volatility is much more damaging to trade
and general economic developments than in, for instance, the United States.'
He applauded how ERM central banks had steered clear of competitive
devaluations in the aftermath of the July and August currency crisis that
resulted in the widening of most ERM fluctuation margins to 15 per cent
either side of central rates.
The cautious approach to short-term interest rates cuts had paid off.

FT  22 OCT 93 / France ready to seize chance of interest rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of France will seize the opportunity to cut interest rates
following yesterday's move by the Bundesbank, according to economists and
currency analysts in Paris.
The intervention rate, which sets the floor for money market interest rates,
is expected to be cut today or early next week by between a quarter and a
half of a percentage point from its present level of 6.75 per cent.
The intervention rate has remained unchanged since the summer's European
currency crisis despite pressure on the government of Mr Edouard Balladur to
reduce borrowing costs to stimulate France's recession-hit economy.
'They are sure to move now,' said Mr Christopher Potts, economist at Banque
Indosuez in Paris. He said that the only question was the size of the cut in
the intervention rate. The cautious approach of the French monetary
authorities to interest rate cuts and the recent weakness of the French
franc against the D-Mark, however, suggest an initial cut of a quarter of a
percentage point rather than a larger reduction.
The Paris stock market responded enthusiastically to the Bundesbank rate
cut. The CAC-40 index rose by almost 2 per cent to 2,189.
The prospects for reduced interest rates were also enhanced yesterday by
statistics from the Bank of France which showed the net deficit in foreign
exchange reserves had narrowed from FFr65.3bn (Pounds 7.6bn) to FFr55.8bn in
the week to October 14.
The need for the central bank to rebuild its foreign exchange reserves,
which were exhausted in the unsuccessful defence of the franc's ERM parity
with the D-Mark, has been one of the principal reasons behind the financial
authorities' commitment to a stable franc and the cautious approach to
interest rate cuts.

Sweden's central bank cut its key interest rate yesterday in a further
attempt to pull the country's economy out of its worst recession since 1945,
writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. The reduction from 8 per cent
to 7.75 per cent is the latest in a series of cuts which has brought the
bank's marginal rate down from 12.5 per cent last November before the
Swedish krona was floated. The cut was made before the Bundesbank decided to
lower German interest rates.

SHARP differences emerged yesterday between the German government and the
opposition over ways of tackling the country's growing unemployment crisis,
and fears over its weakening international competitiveness.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl issued an urgent appeal to both sides of industry to
slow down the rise in wages, and take drastic action to improve labour
flexibility.
In response, Mr Oskar Lafontaine, deputy leader and economy spokesman of the
opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD), called for cross-party and
cross-industry agreement on a national employment pact, with measures from
the government to boost investment spending specifically to create new jobs.
He set out a 10-point programme, intended to be the basis of the SPD
election campaign next year, setting unemployment and economic recovery in
east Germany at the top of the election agenda.
The two statements of economic policy came in a parliamentary debate on the
government's report on securing the country's future as an industrial
location - the so-called Standort Deutschland.
Mr Kohl warned that Germany urgently needed to create up to 5m new
competitive jobs.
He attacked not only labour market inflexibility, but the failure of German
industry to invest enough in research and development, citing in particular
the micro-electronics industry. German companies registered patents for just
181 micro-electronic inventions in 1992, compared with 289 in 1987, he said.
In Japan, the number registered in the same two years rose from 17,408 to
23,082. He also criticised German red tape, and the slow progress in
negotiations on privatisation in two key areas: the Deutsche Telekom, and
the German railways.
He warned that the German small business sector was endangered by the
growing trend towards academic education, and away from industry-oriented
professional training.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Monetary stability helps Bundesbank act
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IF there was one central factor behind yesterday's surprise cut in the
German discount rate to 5.75 per cent, it was last July's loosening of the
shackles of the European exchange rate mechanism.
The widening of the fluctuation bands has reduced virtually to nil the need
for intervention buying of troubled member currencies.
This means first that the Bundesbank's leading indicator, the M3 measure of
money supply growth, will no longer be driven upwards by the backwash of
currencies which has characteristically followed massive interventions in
successive ERM crises. Second, it has promoted an unwelcome, though not
excessive revaluation of the D-Mark. Since the band-widening at the end of
July, and despite a half-point cut in the discount rate on September 10, the
German currency has been effectively revalued by 2 per cent against its
European exchange rate mechanism relations, according to Mr Hans Tietmeyer,
the new central bank president. Against a basket of 20 other important
currencies it is up 3.6 per cent, and 5.5 per cent against the US dollar.
This is not helpful to an export-based economy trying to escape the clutches
of recession.
If, as Mr Tietmeyer said yesterday, the horizon is looking brighter, the
outlook is better at least in part because the view is no longer fogged by
the uncertainties inherent in the management of the ERM. Applying the
instruments of what he called the bank's 'forward-looking policy', he
detected improved prospects for greater monetary stability.
Provisional figures published earlier this week showed M3 growth continuing
to move slowly down towards the 6.5 per cent top limit of the bank's target
range. A surge in private sector credit growth, which helped keep the
September growth rate at 7 per cent was 'only temporary', according to Mr
Tietmeyer.
Inflation was also clearly easing, he said. The latest headline figure was
still 'too high' at 4 per cent, but the consumer prices index had been
rising at an annualised 2.4 per cent over the past six months.
Inflation in the construction sector, which is belatedly feeling the effects
of recession, had also slowed significantly.
The trick now is for all to continue to play their part in providing the
conditions in which the economy can start moving again.
The Bundesbank, as always, hopes for moderation from the coming pay round
and determination from the government on budget consolidation.
As Mr Tietmeyer pointed out, economic growth in the third quarter was
expected to stagnate at second quarter levels, and there were no clear signs
of speedy growth. Incoming orders were a little higher, but exports were not
increasing noticeably.
Industrial capacity utilisation had fallen in September after earlier signs
of improvement.
Showing enthusiasm for cutting rates runs counter to the Bundesbank's
culture, but its pointed efforts of yesterday to improve German
competitiveness with moves apparently calculated to lessen the exchange rate
burden on industry, suggest there is more to come, and like yesterday's
move, cuts could come rather sooner than expected.

THE European Commission president, Mr Jacques Delors, yesterday attacked
those in Europe unwilling to contemplate the sort of changes needed to get
the Community out of its jobs crisis, comparing this 'passivity'
unfavourably with the 'active' nature of US society.
Mr Delors is not known as a great admirer of the US model of economic
development, but used the comparison to underline that 'the biggest scandal
(in Europe) is that we have the lowest rate of participation of the labour
force (in employment) with the highest rates of unemployment'.
The European welfare model of society was essential to the survival of
Europe, he said, but in achieving this, 'our most dangerous adversaries are
those who don't want to change anything'.
Mr Delors was speaking at a three-day conference organised by the Commission
on employment in Europe, which had earlier witnessed EC employers and trade
union leaders cross swords on how to make labour markets more flexible.
Looking forward to the White Paper on competitiveness, growth and employment
that the Commission is producing for the December summit of EC heads of
government, Mr Delors drew attention to general ideas rather than concrete
recommendations which are still being shaped by Brussels.
'First of all we have to reinsert the long term into our economic thinking,'
he declared. He called on EC leaders to retrieve the threads of economic and
monetary union, arguing that 'we are the victims of frequent competitive
devaluations' by our main trading partners in the US and Japan.
The EC, he said, had to stop thinking purely in terms of shedding labour as
the only way of restructuring industry.
It had to think more of moving charges on employment like social security on
to 'the rare resource of the environment', and of ideas like shorter working
hours in order to share out jobs.
Returning to a frequent theme of recent months, the Commission president
said that how the EC dealt with the jobless crisis would show whether Europe
'is opting for survival instead of decline'.
More than 10,000 steelworkers blocked motorways yesterday to protest against
the German government's plan to reduce social welfare payments drastically,
writes Ariane Genillard from Bonn.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Report dents Japan's image as highly efficient manufacturer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S efficiency in manufacturing, according to the international
management consultants McKinsey, is not all that it is cracked up to be. In
some sectors, such as cars and consumer electronics, the Japanese still rule
the world. But in protected areas like food and beer, Japanese productivity
is wretched: so much so, says McKinsey, that Japan's overall productivity is
17 per cent worse than America's, and only a shade better than Germany's.
McKinsey's results, based on a year-long study, measure value added per
hour. The study looked at nine industry sectors, arriving at a weighted
average of performance based on the number of workers employed in each. The
findings on each sector show enormous variations.
Car assembly: In 1990, value added per hour worked in Japan was 16 per cent
higher than in the US. German productivity was one third below US levels.
The key factors governing productivity in the car industry, says McKinsey,
are the organisation of labour and design for manufacturing, rather than
worker skills or high-tech factories.
The US has drawn close to Japanese productivity levels in response to the
challenge of Japanese transplants in the US. The study finds that US
carmakers are now on average as productive as Japanese makers, with the
exception of Toyota, the Japanese industry leader. Germany lags behind Japan
principally because it was protected from Japanese competition in the past.
Motor parts: Japanese productivity is 24 per cent higher than that of the
US, while Germany was 24 per cent lower. Japan's lead is attributed partly
to the strength of its car manufacturers, partly to differences in industry
structure. Whereas Japan has more parts producers in total, far fewer of
them supply directly to the carmakers. This tiered structure reduces the
level of operational complexity - and cost.
Metalworking: Japanese productivity is 19 per cent ahead of that in both the
US and Germany. During the 1980s, Japanese manufacture of machine tools and
robot systems moved from craft methods to a modern industrial process.
Japanese companies thus have longer production runs and economies of scale.
German and US companies have been slow to make this transition, though the
US is catching up.
Steel: The US and Germany are equal in value added per hour worked. Japan is
45 per cent ahead. Only 6 per cent of Germany's production comes from
new-style mini-mills, as against more labour-intensive integrated mills. The
US has the same percentage of mini-mills as Japan. However, it has been held
back by financial restructuring and the lenient US bankruptcy laws, which
have allowed old-style integrated mills to carry on producing despite being
uneconomic.
Computer hardware: Japan lags the US by 5 per cent, Germany by 11 per cent.
Production is global, with US companies accounting for 17 per cent of
Japanese production - the highest figure for any industry. The industry is
characterised by global competition and hence convergence in productivity.
Consumer electronics: Japan is 15 per cent more productive than the US,
Germany 28 per cent less so. Japan's good performance is chiefly due to
intense domestic competition, Germany's poor showing to trade barriers and
protectionism. The US picture is misleading, since the only important
product made in the US is televisions, of which only 8 per cent are made by
indigenous US manufacturers.
Food manufacturing: Japan's output per hour worked is one third of that in
the US and less than half that in Germany. The Japanese industry employs
roughly the same numbers as that in the US for one third of the output. Even
the bigger Japanese companies do not face overseas competition, which is
kept out by tariffs, quotas and the complexities of the distribution system.
Brewing: Japan produces 31 per cent less beer per worker than the US,
Germany 56 per cent less. In Germany, the industry is highly fragmented,
with more than 1,000 breweries producing 12.5bn litres a year, compared to
67 US breweries producing 23.1bn litres. Japanese breweries are large enough
to produce scale economies, but the government protects smaller brewers from
competition.

THE French prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, yesterday urged striking Air
France employees to return to work, as riot police moved to block protesting
workers from runways at the two main airports in Paris.
Making his first comments on the strike which has crippled air travel to and
from Paris for the past three days, he said that the industrial action
threatened serious damage to the national airline.
The strike also reflects a dilemma facing the French government, which wants
loss-making public sector companies to be restructured but is anxious to
avoid protests against large-scale job cuts and the country's rising
unemployment rate.
Reflecting this delicate balance, Mr Balladur emphasised that Air France's
austerity plan, which envisages 4,000 job cuts by the end of next year,
would be implemented with a minimum of forced redundancies. However, he
described the plan as vital for the survival of the airline which lost
FFr3.8bn (Pounds 440m) in the first half.
Air France was again forced to cancel hundreds of flights to and from Paris
yesterday.

NATO recognises that it is on the way towards enlargement to include former
members of the Warsaw Pact, Mr Les Aspin, US defence secretary, said
yesterday.
'We know that there's going to be an expanding membership,' he said. He went
further in his prediction than did Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary,
who earlier described enlargement as an 'option'.
Mr Aspin was speaking after presenting proposals at the Nato defence
ministers' meeting in Travemunde for a series of limited defence agreements
between Nato and individual eastern European countries.
This 'partnership for peace' proposal, which received unanimous support at
the meeting, is open to all former Warsaw Pact countries as well as neutral
European states.
Mr Aspin would not say how many of these countries could be accommodated
later as members, or when they might join. But most Nato ministers at the
meeting thought enlargement would come 'sooner rather than later', he said.
The proposed agreements would enable Nato to call on additional military
resources for operations such as peacekeeping, Mr Aspin said. They would
also provide 'military groundwork' that would be valuable when those
countries joined the alliance.
Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, said the proposed agreements
could be seen as advancing countries 'on the way towards membership'. But
admission would not be automatic.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Russian banks at risk of closure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DOZENS of Russian commercial banks could soon be closed or restructured as a
result of a sweeping review by the central bank, Russia's new banking
supervision chief said yesterday.
Mr Dmitry Tulin, deputy governor of the central bank, said 22 Moscow
commercial banks, whose operations with the central bank were suspended two
weeks ago, were just a small part of a nationwide problem. The central bank
stopped refinancing them after they exceeded its five-day overdraft limit.
'That number of 22 may increase enormously after the analysis we are going
to conduct,' Mr Tulin said, speaking a week after assuming the supervision
job in addition to his responsibility for foreign exchange operations and
domestic securities.
Mr Tulin plans to focus on banks whose overdrafts with the central bank are
due to 'serious financial problems', as opposed to fraud by their clients or
Russia's inefficient payments system. Such banks would either be bailed out,
offered to bigger institutions, or, for the first time in Russia's
post-Communist history, closed down. 'The withdrawal of licences and
liquidation are very new to us, so we'll have to cross a minefield of hidden
problems on this road.'
Mr Tulin plans to examine the first bank failure today. He describes the
case as typical, with the bank's founders having borrowed Rbs4bn from the
central bank, converted it into Dollars 4m, sent it to 'an exotic offshore
location' and then disappeared.
There are almost 2,000 banks in the sector, but 100 of them account for
two-thirds of all banking business. Restructuring has so far been delayed as
a result of lax monetary policy, which has been tighter since the
suppression of the parliamentary rebellion, and by the difficulties of
supervising a sector open to fraud and crime.
A first step towards restructuring was taken from July 1, when a minimum
capital requirement of Rbs100m came into force. But even after banks had
been given six months' notice to comply, more than 40 per cent of all banks,
still did not meet the minimum requirement.

PRESIDENT Bill Clinton of the US yesterday threw his weight behind Mr Eduard
Shevardnadze, the embattled Georgian leader, expressing his full support for
the Georgian president and 'territorial unity and sovereignty' of Georgia.
In a letter to Mr Shevardnadze, Mr Clinton offered to send more humanitarian
aid and to act as a mediator in the bitter conflict between the Georgian
government and Abkhaz separatists, who seized most of Abkhazia last month.
Mr Clinton also invited Mr Shevardnadze to talks in Washington. The
invitation provides a boost for Mr Shevardnadze, who has suffered losses
both to Abkhaz separatists and to rebels loyal to the former leader, Mr
Zviad Gamsakhurdia.
The situation in western Georgia, scene of the fighting between rebel forces
and the government army remained confused. The government claimed to have
seized the port of Poti but Mr Gamsakhurdia denied the report.
Reuter adds: Mr Gamsakhurdia said yesterday his rebels controlled most of
western Georgia and that he did not intend to take the capital Tbilisi by
force.

THE French prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, yesterday urged striking Air
France employees to return to work, as riot police moved to block protesting

Making his first comments on the strike which has crippled air travel to and
from Paris for the past three days, he said that the industrial action
threatened serious damage to the national airline.
The strike also reflects a dilemma facing the French government which wants
loss-making public sector companies to be restructured but is anxious to

unemployment rate.
Reflecting this delicate balance, Mr Balladur emphasised that Air France's
austerity plan, which envisages 4,000 job cuts by the end of next year,
would be implemented with a minimum of forced redundancies. However, he
described the plan as vital for the survival of the airline which lost
FFr3.8bn (Pounds 440m) in the first half of this year.
Mr Balladur expressed complete support for Mr Bernard Attali, the chairman
of Air France, who announced the airline's restructuring plan last month.
But he said he had asked Mr Bernard Boisson, the transport minister, to
ensure that sacrifices demanded of Air France employees were shared equally.
In addition to protesting against the job cuts, Air France ground staff are
fighting reduced overtime payments. They say they are being treated more
harshly than pilots and cabin staff in the plan. Mr Attali, who estimates
that the strike is costing Air France about FFr70m per day, has said he is
determined that the plan will be implemented without changes.
Air France was again forced to cancel hundreds of flights to and from Paris
yesterday. Riot police managed to clear runways at Charles de Gaulle and
Orly airports, but striking groundstaff then blocked many of the roads to
the two airports for several hours. French television reports said that
several Air France workers had been hurt in clashes with riot police.
The protests are being spearheaded by two union federations, Force Ouvriere,
and the left-wing Confederation Generale du Travail. The striking workers,
who number several hundred at both Orly and Charles de Gaulle airports, have
closed runways through sit down strikes and prevented passengers reaching
the airport.
A spokesman for Aeroports de Paris, the French airports authority, said it
was unclear what the situation would be today. He said, however, that
foreign airlines remained much less affected than Air France and continued
to land yesterday at both Orly and Charles de Gaulle airports.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Brussels plan for 20m jobs needs more than ideas: Flynn
proposals may mark a turn in Europe's social agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS not often that EC commissioners receive spontaneous ovations from
their peers at Commission meetings. But Mr Padraig Flynn, the EC's social
affairs commissioner, received one last week after spelling out his ideas
for creating jobs without dismantling labour protection.
These ideas will form the basis of the labour market section of Mr Jacques
Delors' White Paper on growth, competitiveness and employment, to be
published next month.
Most of the innovations  - such as shifting employers' non-wage labour costs
on to the state and paying for them with an EC energy tax  - lie outside the
Commission's competence.
So it is primarily an exercise in exhortation and setting targets. Reaching
the target of 5 per cent EC unemployment by the year 2000, down from the
current 10.4 per cent, will require the creation of 20m jobs and looks
over-ambitious even if the Commission's proposals are widely adopted.
What lies behind the Commission's new thinking on job creation? The labour
market reformers around Mr Flynn do not like to use the concept of
deregulation  - they see it as being tainted by association with the easy
hire-and-fire laws of Britain. But some of Mr Flynn's ideas, articulated in
Brussels this week, are not so far away from the views of Britain's
Conservatives. Member states should encourage increases in hourly wages
below the rate of productivity growth.
Member states should reduce the cost of less-skilled labour, especially in
the labour-intensive service sector, by cutting taxes and social security
contributions and making them more progressive.
Competition policy should be reviewed to remove distorting general subsidies
to employment. Officials also talk privately about shifting industrial
subsidies from large companies  - which now receive the lion's share  - to
small and medium-sized businesses.
To suspicious European trade unionists much of this will sound like using
the language of the left  - solidarity between the employed and the
unemployed  - to implement a policy usually associated with the right -
restraining labour costs.
Mr Flynn's aides would argue that the coupling together of 'solidarity and
competitiveness' transcends left and right. 'There is a bit in the White
Paper for everyone and there is quite a lot that we do not expect the unions
to like. But the key point is how to achieve equity and welfare goals in
ways that do not price people out of jobs,' said one official.
However, many questions remain unanswered. For example, by what mechanism in
a market economy can wage restraint or a reduction in working time by the
securely employed be effectively translated into new jobs for the
unemployed?
Neither does Mr Flynn spell out his idea of 're-regulation' - as opposed to
deregulation - to take account of the demise of the steady job for life. He
has talked about adapting benefit systems in line with the fact that many
new jobs are part-time. But beyond that he has offered only vague
generalisations about how working time should be reorganised to respond to
workers' new expectations and to fully exploit new capital equipment.
Critics concede that more employment intensive growth and a wider sharing of
jobs and incomes are laudable goals. But action to reach these goals
requires intervening in national labour market regulations, pay-setting
systems and welfare regimes, which all have long histories and are not
easily disturbed by national governments, let alone the European Commission.
British critics would point out that the EC's immediate legislative agenda
in the social field - the working time directive and works council - has
little to do with job creation.
By the year 2000 Mr Flynn will no longer be in Brussels and people will
probably have forgotten his 5 per cent unemployment goal, but they might
just remember his package of ideas as marking a new turn in Europe's social
agenda.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Brussels pushes through regional aid share-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday pushed through the main part of its
share-out to member states from the Ecu157bn (Pounds 121.8bn) regional aid
budget for 1994-99, overriding last minute protests from Ireland and
complaints from Italy.
Brussels also warned the UK again that it stood to lose 'a significant
amount' of its entitlement of aid from the 1989-93 budget, because of
failure to observe obligatory requirements to match EC funds with equivalent
sums from the national budget.
Yesterday's decision came after overnight meetings between Mr Dick Spring,
the Irish foreign minister, Commission president Jacques Delors, and Mr
Bruce Millan, EC regional policy commissioner. Dublin accused Mr Delors of
going back on his word to guarantee Ireland IPounds 7.8bn (Pounds 7.4bn)
from the new structural aid programme.
Nevertheless, the Commission yesterday allocated Ireland IPounds 7.2bn - the
lower end of the band discussed at marathon meetings of the EC council of
ministers last July, when Ireland had threatened to veto the whole
programme.
Mr Millan said yesterday: 'I think we've got a very fair and equitable
distribution here.' He pointed out that the Commission was obliged to share
out the money on objective criteria, like population, income per head,
unemployment levels and size of rural workforce. Ireland, which under the
last aid programme received twice as much per capita as the three other
poorest EC member states, Spain, Portugal and Greece, was getting 'extremely
good figures', he insisted.
But he held out hope for higher allocations for Ireland, announcing there
would be a mid-term review, which could reallocate funds from member states
whose aid programmes were performing badly, to those who were making best
use of the EC finance. Ireland, he acknowledged, 'is a very good performer'.
Italy, one of the worst performers under the Ecu63bn programme for 1989-93,
got a new allocation of Ecu14.9bn, or Ecu1.9bn less than it was expecting.
The funds allocated yesterday were for 'Objective 1' or backward regions,
which overall receive Ecu93bn of the structural aid budget. In 1992 prices,
Spain got around Ecu38bn, Greece and Portugal more than Ecu19bn, Germany
nearly Ecu14bn for its eastern Lander, and France and the UK over Ecu2bn
each.
The UK allocation for Objective 1 areas, for Northern Ireland, Merseyside
and the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, came out at Ecu2.36bn for
1994-99, in 1994 prices, at the top end of expectations.
But Mr Millan said he was concerned Britain would not be be able to take up
its full entitlement under the current programme because of the continuing
dispute over how the UK accounts for the money. 'That situation will have to
be remedied very quickly,' he said, otherwise the money will be lost by the
end of the year.
He also confirmed that the UK was in danger of losing 'a fairly large sum of
money' it could seek from the European Social Fund for retraining the
unemployed, because it had failed to claim in line with devalued pounds
following sterling's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism
last year.
Mr Millan would not put figures on the UK's unclaimed allocation but said
'there is still a significant amount to be claimed before the end of the
year'. By contrast, much higher amounts unclaimed by Italy  - because of a
failure to come forward with plausible projects  - had been reprogrammed
into projects which were successful.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROW between the Irish government and Mr Jaques Delors, the European
Commission president, over Ireland's allocation of EC structural aid for
1994-99, intensified yesterday.
Claims and counterclaims have flown between Mr Delors and Dublin over
whether or not the Commission promised to allocate to Dublin more EC money
than it was able to give.
The Commission yesterday approved an allocation of IPounds 7.2bn, IPounds
640m less than the Irish government claims it had been assured by Mr Delors
in a meeting last July.
Last night in an interview with Irish radio and TV, Mr Delors said that Mr
Bertie Ahern, the Irish finance minister, had asked the Commission to delay
the funding announcement to Ireland until after the Irish Government had set
out its IPounds 20bn national development plan  - in effect to avoid adverse
publicity at the plan's launch. 'I followed his advice and postponed the
meeting,' Mr Delors said.
Mr Delors had already said, earlier this week, it was 'a lie' that he had
broken a promise to Irish ministers.
The EC funds are the linchpin to Ireland's national development plan, which
aims to create 200,000 jobs up to the end of the decade.
Mr Ahern said: 'I have some control, but unfortunately my power does not
extend to deferring Commission meetings in Brussels or changing items of the
agenda. . . What upset me, and it's not easy to upset me, is the idea all of
a sudden I have the power to change Commission meetings, to change the
agenda, because that is something that just did not happen. . . The only
thing I asked him was that we expected that the agreement of July 20, as we
understood it, would be honoured.'
The row spilled over into the Irish parliament, where angry exchanges
between government and opposition led to temporary suspension of debate and
expulsion from the House of Mr Prionsias de Rossa, the leader of the
opposition Democratic Left party. Mr De Rossa had accused the government of
'fraud and deception' over the EC structural aid figures.
Mr Albert Reynolds, Irish prime minister, shouted: 'I will not accept that.
I misled nobody.'
After returning from the EC Edinburgh summit last December, when agreement
was reached on expanding the structural fund and creating a new cohesion
fund, Mr Reynolds told parliament: 'The agreement now reached ensures, and I
say this with complete confidence, that Ireland will obtain in excess of
IPounds 8bn over seven years. This will comprise up to IPounds 1bn from the
new Cohesion fund and more than IPounds 7bn from the structural funds.'
Nonetheless, Mr Ahern acknowledged yesterday that Mr Delors' goal on
structural fund shareout was opposed by Mr Bruce Millan, commissioner
responsible for regional policy. 'I knew all year he had problems (with the
figure). . . what Bruce Millan was saying for many months is what has
happened in effect,' he said.

FT  22 OCT 93 / QVC makes Dollars 4.8bn cash offer to control Paramount
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
QVC NETWORK, the US television home shopping busi ness, yesterday formally
launched a hostile takeover bid for Paramount Communications, the
entertainment company, with a Dollars 4.8bn (Pounds 3.17bn) cash tender
offer for 51 per cent of Paramount's shares. It also announced that it was
taking legal action against the Paramount board.
QVC, which proposed a Dollars 9.5bn cash and shares takeover of Paramount
last month, has been frustrated at the company's refusal so far to open
discussions, while Paramount proceeds with plans for an agreed Dollars 7.6bn
cash and shares takeover launched by Viacom, a cable television company.
The tender, due to begin by October 27, maintains QVC's cash and shares
offer at Dollars 80 per Paramount share, but it increases the amount of cash
from about Dollars 30 a share to Dollars 40. It moves the bid from the
status of a proposal, to be discussed with Paramount's management, into a
hostile act to be considered by its shareholders.
Analysts said it was likely to force Viacom into improving its offer for
Paramount. It may also push Paramount's board into speedier consideration of
QVC's offer. Paramount has argued that it needs to proceed with caution lest
it violate the terms of its Viacom agreement. QVC said it was going ahead
with a cash offer for 51 per cent of Paramount's stock at a price of Dollars
80 a share.
If that succeeded, it would then launch a second-stage tender in which it
would acquire each Paramount share for 1.42857 QVC shares.
The combined value of the offer would be about Dollars 9.5bn, the same as
its original takeover announcement, although only Dollars 30 a share of the
initial proposal was in cash and the rest in QVC shares. Viacom's offer
contains only Dollars 9.10 a share in cash.
QVC added that it was launching legal action against both Paramount and
Viacom for breach of fiduciary duty. It accuses Paramount of giving undue
advantage to Viacom.
It asked the court to void agreements under which Paramount must pay Viacom
Dollars 100m if its bid fails, and Viacom's option to buy 20 per cent of

FT  22 OCT 93 / Harman to retain shadow Treasury job despite vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH decided last night to retain Ms Harriet Harman as shadow chief
Treasury secretary despite her failure in Wednesday night's annual shadow
cabinet election.
The Labour leader made only limited changes to his team, although Mr John
Prescott was rewarded for his performance at last month's Labour conference
with promotion to shadow employment secretary - one of the three core
economic jobs.
Labour officials characterised the decision to keep Ms Harman on as a signal
of Mr Smith's determination not to be pushed around by the parliamentary
party. The decision means the shadow chief secretary's job will be held by
someone outside the shadow cabinet for the first time in seven years.
But Mr Smith's caution was greeted with dismay by some shadow cabinet
members who had expected a wider-ranging shake-up.
The changes will take effect after next month's Queen's speech, leaving Mr
Prescott, as the present transport spokesman, free to spearhead Labour's
opposition to the railways bill when it returns to the Commons.
Mr Smith made no changes in the four senior portfolios, with Mr Jack
Cunningham reconfirmed as shadow foreign secretary, in spite of retaining
his shadow cabinet place by a margin of just three votes.
Mr Robin Cook, who topped the poll, will remain as shadow trade and industry
secretary. Mr Gordon Brown and Mr Tony Blair, the party's foremost
modernisers who both dropped down the rankings, stay as shadow chancellor
and shadow home secretary respectively.
Mr George Robertson, elected to the shadow cabinet for the first time, was
moved straight into a prominent position as shadow Scottish secretary. The
experienced Ms Joan Lestor, the other newcomer, was given a newly created
portfolio with responsibility for children and the family.
Mr Prescott swapped jobs with Mr Frank Dobson, another leading figure from
the party's centre-left, with whom he tied for second place in Wednesday
night's ballot. But Mr Dobson will retain responsibility for London in
moving from employment to transport. Ms Marjorie Mowlam was moved from the
public services portfolio to national heritage in place of Ms Ann Clwyd, who
lost her shadow cabinet seat. Mr Tom Clarke was moved from Scotland to
overseas development, replacing Mr Michael Meacher who will take over the
public services beat.
Officials said there would be no procedural changes for next year's
election. In spite of a rule change introduced this year which was designed
to increase female representation on the shadow cabinet, the number of women
elected fell from four to three.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Bundesbank cuts rates by half percentage point: Surprise
German move eases pressure on weak ERM currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES, PETER JOHN and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GERMAN Bundesbank cut its discount and Lombard rates by half a
percentage point each yesterday, triggering a spate of rate cuts across
continental Europe.
The surprise move eased pressures on several weak currencies in the European
exchange rate mechanism.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, said in Washington that the cut
would 'help strengthen world growth and create jobs'.
The German central bank agreed at a meeting of its decision-making council
to cut its discount rate, which sets the floor for German money rates, to
5.75 per cent. The Lombard rate, which it uses to lend emergency funds to
banks against collateral, was lowered to 6.75 per cent.
The move - which followed a similar half a percentage point reduction in
both rates on September 9 - was followed by cuts in interest rates in the
Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Austria and Switzerland. Sweden had anticipated
the German move by cutting rates earlier in the day.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the new Bundesbank president, said the cut marked an
adaptation to economic changes. Factors influencing the decision included
the revaluation, in effect, of the D-Mark against other currencies since the
widening of the ERM's fluctuation bands at the beginning of August.
But he said the bank's policy was not driven by exchange rate
considerations, nor was it affected by other people's thinking or
requirements. 'We cannot be a central bank for Europe.' Asked about recent
tensions in the ERM, notably affecting the Belgian franc, he said he hoped
they were temporary.
Yesterday's decision appeared to have been heavily influenced by poor
prospects for a domestically-driven recovery from recession. German
economists expect internal demand to remain weak well into next year.
On Bundesbank calculations, the German economy has yet to show signs of
recovery. Third quarter gross domestic product was expected to be unchanged
from the second quarter, Mr Tietmeyer said. The bank was trying to support
recovery 'within the limits of its powers'. The Bundesbank also cut its
'repo' rate, with which it provides liquidity to the banking system, to 6.4
per cent from 6.67 per cent.
Although neither France nor Britain took advantage of the boost the German
move gave to their currencies against the D-Mark by cutting borrowing rates,
stock markets in both countries moved ahead strongly on the expectation of
moves to ease borrowing conditions.
On the Paris bourse, shares surged by 2.3 per cent while in London the FT-SE
100 index of leading shares gained 32 points to close at 3,188.3, for the
second consecutive record closing high. Elsewhere, share prices on the
Zurich and Amsterdam bourses moved ahead by about 1 per cent.
Currency markets saw heavy selling of the D-Mark as investors shifted funds
into the US dollar. The dollar rose nearly two pfennigs against the D-Mark
in London to DM1.6635 and the pound closed more than two pfennigs higher on
the day at DM2.4725. Both currencies were at similar levels in late New York
trading.
The French franc rebounded by two centimes to FFr3.5120 against the D-Mark
in London as investors anticipated an early rate cut, and edged higher to
FFr3.5055 in New York. The Belgian franc was hampered by doubts over the
social pact on wages and employment, particularly after unions walked out of
negotiations. The currency staged a more choppy recovery, but closed against
the D-Mark in London at BFr21.67, up from BFr21.82.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Ministers blamed for Pounds 56m extra cost of Malaysian aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL Audit Office yesterday fiercely criticised the government for
approving aid funding for a Pounds 417m hydro-electric power plant in
Malaysia against the overwhelming technical and commercial advice of civil
servants.
Its report says the funding arrangements, chosen by the government, will add
at least Pounds 56m to the aid provided by the UK taxpayer over the 14-year
life of the project, led by Balfour Beatty, the UK construction group owned
by BICC.
The total Pounds 234m cost to the taxpayer is the largest cash sum ever
provided by the British government for a single aid-funded scheme.
The report traces how Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, gave the
green light in July 1991, overriding more than two years of advice to the
government that the hydro-power project, on the Pergau river in peninsular
Malaysia's eastern state of Kelantan, was uneconomical. It will mean
Malaysians pay Pounds 100m more in electricity costs than less expensive
alternatives.
The report makes it clear that foreign policy factors, rather than any
commercial logic, dictated the decision to go ahead. The government was
anxious to patch up relations with Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime
minister, who had followed a 'buy British last' policy for almost a decade
in retaliation against increases in fees for foreign students at UK
universities.
If the government had followed the most economical financing arrangements,
UK taxpayers would be spending not Pounds 234m in aid support for the
project but Pounds 108m.
'Even if costs were discounted to their present values, the chosen method of
implementation would cost the UK Pounds 56m more than it might otherwise
have done,' the report says. From as early as 1987, when a World Bank report
concluded that Malaysia should concentrate entirely on gas-fired electricity
generation until the turn of the century, all technical advice to the
government pointed to the Pergau hydro-power project being uneconomical.
In 1989, after increases in the project cost, the Overseas Development
Administration, which manages the UK aid programme, concluded the project
would be 'a very bad buy' and a burden on Malaysian consumers.
Government budget constraints apparently blocked the most sensible funding
arrangement - providing a large grant in the early years of the project in
the form of mixed credits. This would have involved a commitment of about
Pounds 70m in the peak payment year. Instead, soft-loan funding was
arranged.
The ODA's accounting officer 'emphasised to ministers that his
responsibility was to ensure that aid funds were administered in a prudent
and economical manner, and believed that providing funds for Pergau would
not be consistent with this'.

FT  22 OCT 93 / Whistle while you work, brothers, but not at women
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOMEN have not had a good week in the corridors of power but there may be
some consolation from the TGWU, Britain's biggest trade union.
The union has asked its 300,000 male workers in the construction industry to
show women a bit more respect.
Mr George Henderson, national secretary of its construction section, has
urged building workers to cut out the wolf whistles, lewd comments and
gestures widely associated with 'that small minority of workers on sites who
have never behaved like proper men'.
Mr Henderson said yesterday: 'For some people, the whole thing may seem to
be just a joke. But it is no joke for women who have to endure unacceptable
behaviour from men who delude themselves that they are paying a compliment
to the victims of their unwanted attention.'
He said he was not advocating prudishness. 'But, I would suggest that the
men responsible should consider treating women with more respect.' He urged
employers' organisations, his own regional secretaries and other trade
unions with members in the construction industry to set a good example.

FT  21 OCT 93 / UK Company News: St James's Place net assets improve 17.2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ST JAMES's Place Capital, Lord Rothschild's financial services group,
reported a 17.2 per cent rise in net assets per share in the six months to
September 30.
As announced in July, the company is distributing to shareholders its 37.4
per cent holding in RIT Capital Partners, the investment trust managed by J.
Rothschild Capital Management. In addition, St James's Place is distributing
Pounds 32.7m of cash; at September 30 values, shareholders should receive
48.7p per share in a combination of shares and cash.
St James's Place will be left with a range of financial services
subsidiaries plus a portfolio of investments - J Rothschild Assurance
(the life insurance group), Global Asset Management (29.7 per cent owned
by Rothschild) and International Financial Markets Trading, both fund
management groups, and J. Rothschild Wolfensohn, a 50:50 joint venture
in boutique corporate
finance with James Wolfensohn Inc.
However, these businesses make up only Pounds 38m of St James's Place's
Pounds 211m of assets. The remainder is invested in international bonds and
equities, with a particular emphasis on German zero coupon bonds.
Unrealised dealing gains of some Pounds 16.1m in the first half were a main
reason for the rise in net assets to 126.2p a share, against 107.7p at the
March 31 year-end. The directors announced last year that the company should
be judged on a net asset, rather than a profit and loss basis.
However, pre-tax profits doubled from Pounds 7m to Pounds 14.1m, helped by
the elimination of both investment dealing losses and start-up costs at J.
Rothschild Assurance. Earnings per share improved to 5.9p (3p) and the
interim dividend is maintained at 1.5p.
The company added: 'We continue to regard international equity markets with
caution in view of the fragility of the apparent economic recovery in the US
and the UK and the recessionary climate in Europe and Japan.'
RIT Capital Partners also announced its results yesterday, revealing that
net asset value had risen by 12 per cent to 202.9p a share over the six
months to September 30. Total net assets were Pounds 398m at the end of
September.
Since March 31 RIT has sold more than three quarters of its interest in
Newmont Mining, the gold mining group, realising about Pounds 114m. It has
invested part of the proceeds in gold call options, a similar strategy to
that followed by Sir James Goldsmith. As of September 30, RIT had a total
portfolio of Pounds 468m of which Pounds 230m was in quoted equities, Pounds
61m in bonds, Pounds 91m in specialist funds, Pounds 63m in unquoted
equities and Pounds 23m in property.

NET profits at Accor, the French hotel and tourism group, fell to FFr109m
(Dollars 18.8m) in the first half from FFr137m last time as the fiercely
competitive condition of the European hotel business took its toll, writes
Alice Rawsthorn in Paris.
The group, still burdened by heavy debts following the acquisition in 1991
of Wagons-Lits, the Belgian travel group, also warned of a fall in net
profits for the full financial year.
It said that although the seasonal nature of its business meant the second
half would be better than the first, it expected net profits to settle at
between FFr550m and FFr650m for the full year.

<TEXT>
MATRA-HACHETTE, the French defence electronics, automotive and media group,
yesterday announced a doubling in first-half net profits to FFr302m (Dollars
53.4m) from FFr152m and forecast an increase for the full year from the
FFr354m achieved in 1992.
Lagardere Group, the holding company that controls Matra-Hachette, also
announced a sharp improvement, raising net profits to FFr85m from FFr10m
Matra-Hachette and Lagardere said they were discussing ways of merging the
two companies.
The result of these discussions would be known soon, they said.
Matra-Hachette, which was formed last year by the merger of the two
businesses, said that sales in the first half slipped by 3 per cent to
FFr26.3bn.
The rise in first-half profits partly reflected a reduction in financial
charges, to FFr249m from FFr382m resulting from a reduction in debt.
Operating profits remained stable at FFr1.32bn, with the group's space,
defence, audiovisual and transport businesses offsetting declines in other
activities.
The increase in profits was also achieved despite a rise in exceptional
charges, to FFr418m in the first six months of this year from FFr251m in the
first half of 1992.
This year's charges include restructuring costs relating to the merger which
formed the group.

eventually combine its advertising activities with Aegis' media-buying.
Aegis intends to raise Pounds 61.2m (Dollars 92.41m) of new equity finance
through an open offer of Pounds 46.2m of new ordinary shares.

THE CITY state of Bremen confirmed yesterday that a consortium of local
companies had signed a provisional agreement with Klockner-Werke, the
diversified steel group, about the possible purchase of its ailing steel
plant in the region, writes Ariane Genillard in Bonn.
The offer will be reviewed by Klockner-Werke's board of directors, which is
due to meet on November 11. A Klockner spokesman said it had 'a good chance'
of being accepted.
According to the provisional agreement, the consortium is expected to buy 75
per cent of the plant for a symbolic price. Klockner-Werke would keep the
remaining shares.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Compaq net income more than doubles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COMPAQ Computer, which yesterday reported a sharp increase in profits, is
reaping the benefit of its continued emphasis on cost control and product
innovation.
The US group is the only large personal computer maker that is consistently
profitable and it could soon overtake Apple Computer as world number two
after International Business Machines.
Shares in the Texas-based manufacturer rose Dollars 2 1/2 to close at
Dollars 64 7/8 , on third quarter profits which surpassed most analysts'
expectations.
It reported net income of Dollars 106.77m for the quarter to September 30,
more than double last year's Dollars 49.37m. Revenues rose 64 per cent to
Dollars 1.75bn.
It is the fifth quarter in a row that Compaq has reported record sales. The
results are all the more remarkable because the third quarter is
traditionally its weakest.
Earnings per share more than doubled to Dollars 1.25, fully diluted,
compared with 0.61 a year ago.
Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer, chief executive and the principal architect of Compaq's
turnround 16 months ago, attributed the results to continued product
innovation, an emphasis on manufacturing efficiencies and effective
management of distribution channels.
Until the middle of 1992, the company's market share and profitability had
been threatened by a strategy of charging a premium price for quality and
distributing strictly through approved dealers.
Mr Pfeiffer sought ways of manufacturing a quality product at lower prices
and looked for new avenues to market. The ensuing price war seems to have
hit Compaq's competitors while markedly improving the company's market
share.
Mr Pfeiffer said Compaq was one of the world's most efficient PC producers
with revenues of Dollars 700,000 per employee. 'During the year we increased
our strategic investments in product development, marketing, advertising and
geographic expansion while successfully cutting operating expenses,' he
added.
The company had concentrated on broadening its product range and taking
steps to avoid conflict in the complex of distributors, dealers and
retailers that it uses to market its products.
All geographic regions contributed to the sales growth. Europe and North
America grew 37 and 75 per cent respectively although Mr Pfeiffer pointed
out that, measured in local currencies, growth in Europe was closer to 70
per cent.
Japan, Latin America and the Pacific Rim all grew at rates in excess of 100
per cent.
For the first nine months, revenues were Dollars 4.99bn, up 86 per cent,
while net income was Dollars 311.4m, up 152 per cent, equivalent to Dollars
3.68 a share, fully diluted.
Inventory rose sharply to Dollars 1.3bn at September 30 compared with
Dollars 834m at December 31 last year. Mr Pfeiffer said this was in
anticipation of a good fourth quarter, traditionally Compaq's strongest.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Envoys call for broader Haitian government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US and United Nations envoys are pressing Mr Robert Malval, Haiti's
pro-democracy prime minister, to include ministers loyal to the military in
an expanded government, an aide to ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide
said yesterday, Reuter reports from New York.
The aide said the US Ambassador to Haiti, Mr William Swing and UN special
envoy Dante Caputo want Mr Malval to sign a communique saying he will
'expand' his government if military leader Lt Gen Raoul Cedras and
Port-au-Prince Police Chief Michel Francois step down.
Their resignations are called for in the peace accord signed by Gen Cedras
and the democratically elected President Aristide on New York's Governors
Island last July 3.
The refusal of the two men to resign has led to a showdown between Haiti's
military rulers and the UN with an oil and arms embargo reimposed and US and
other warships patrolling waters off the Caribbean country.
The Aristide aide said that Mr Malval has so far not agreed to sign the
communique, presented to him Tuesday at a meeting with the two envoys. He
has informed Mr Aristide of the plan, the aide said.
The aide said Aristide supporters were worried that such a 'compromise'
would in effect make the Governors Island accord largely meaningless because
including military supporters in key positions would prevent Mr Aristide
from ending the military's hold on the country.
It was not specifically known what ministries pro-military allies would be
given if Mr Malval 'expanded' his government.
But Mr Evans Francois, the police chief's brother who is an adviser to Gen
Cedras, told the Los Angeles Times on Tuesday that the military wanted its
allies in control of the ministries of defence, interior, social welfare and
information in a government of national reconciliation.
'Malval is under intense pressure to sign the communique,' the Aristide aide
said.
The aide said the communique that Mr Malval has been asked to sign for the
military to honour the Governors Island accord and for a law to be passed
banning paramilitary groups from owning guns.
The aide said a key paragraph in the proposed communique would have Mr
Malval say: 'As far as I am concerned as head of government, if this general
plan is implemented, I am prepared to further expand my government. I will
be looking for individuals whose integrity and honesty is unquestioned.'

FT  21 OCT 93 / Swedish economy to shrink by 2.8%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SWEDISH economy will shrink by 2.8 per cent this year, its worst
performance since the second world war, according to the government.
Its latest forecast is much more pessimistic than the one it gave in April,
when it predicted a fall of just 1.7 per cent. However, it believes 1993
will mark the low point, with GNP growth of 1.9 per cent expected in 1994
and 2.9 per cent in 1995.
Mrs Anne Wibble, the finance minister, said: 'The road back to sustained
growth, full employment and healthy financing is a long one, but more and
more signs of recovery can now be discerned'.
No growth in private consumption is expected in 1994, and public consumption
is forecast to fall 1.3 per cent. Unemployment will rise to 8.4 per cent,
excluding those on training schemes, before falling to 7.9 per cent in 1995.
To help tackle the unemployment crisis, the government yesterday announced
plans to nearly halve employers' social security contributions for new
staff. The measure will apply to all companies with more employees in 1994
than in September 1993, and is partly designed to combat explosive growth in
overtime.
The government is relying on export-led recovery to get Sweden out of a
three-year economic trough, and to cut the budget deficit and state
borrowing totals which, in relative terms, are among the highest in the
western world. It expects the public finance deficit to fall from SKr208bn
(Dollars 26bn), or 14.5 per cent of GNP, in 1993 to SKr180bn, or 12 per cent
of GNP, in 1995.
New measures to help achieve a targetted SKr81bn strengthening of the budget
over five years include higher individual social security charges and
reduced medical subsidies.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Air France strikers face force threat
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STRIKING Air France workers were warned yesterday by Mr Bernard Bosson, the
French transport minister, that the government would use force 'if
necessary' to clear them from the runways at the two main Paris airports.
Both Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports were yesterday thrown into chaos
for the second successive day because of the strike by employees, who are
protesting against proposals to cut 4,000 jobs and to reduce overtime pay at
the loss-making national airline.
Mr Bosson said after leaving a parliamentary session that the situation was
'intolerable' and that the government would act on its threat to clear the
runways forcibly 'if it remains impossible for the airlines to operate'.
The strike also spread to airports elsewhere in France, with Nice and
Marseilles being blocked for part of the day. Both Air France and Aeroports
de Paris, which runs the Paris airports, said last night that they could
give no indication as to the likely situation today.
Air France workers occupied the runways at Orly, the main airport for
domestic flights, for most of yesterday morning. The blockade was broken up
by police during the afternoon, but the strikers returned in early evening.
Squads of riot police moved into Charles de Gaulle airport during the early
hours of the morning to stop strikers from occupying the runways and forming
picket lines on access roads as they did on Tuesday.
Some international airlines, including Germany's Lufthansa, managed to get
flights out of Charles de Gaulle. However, hundreds of other international
flights and almost all Air France flights were cancelled. Several carriers
took passengers by coach to Brussels or Frankfurt, but hundreds of people
were left stranded at airport hotels.
Mr Bernard Attali, chairman of Air France, called on the unions to start
negotiating on a local basis. Central discussions between Air France and the
unions were suspended last weekend. Mr Attali also affirmed that, despite
the strike, he was still determined to press ahead with his cost- cutting
plan.

FT  21 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Guinness firm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International drinks group Guinness was once again the focus of attention as
NatWest Securities launched a Pounds 100m warrant, which gives investors the
chance to buy the underlying ordinary shares. The move will go some way to
shoring up investor confidence in the stock, which has recently been
undermined by a series of negative stories. It rallied 8 to 413p yesterday.
Since the group's poor set of results last month, the shares have slumped 22
per cent on a raft of bearish rumours. Many of these have concerned
Guinness's relationship with LVMH, with speculation rife that a
restructuring of the companies' 24 per cent cross-holding is likely. Talk of
executive changes was last week rewarded with the departure of the head of
United Distillers. Yesterday, old talk of an LVMH rights offer was matched
with rumours of a Pounds 400m Guinness bond issue.
However, NatWest said yesterday that it believed that Guinness represented
'the best long-term growth stock in the drinks sector', and that the warrant
had been driven by 'strong customer demand'.
Profits upgradings after a better than expected set of full-year figures
from aerospace and medical products group Smiths Industries drove the stock
sharply forward to record one of the day's biggest advances in the market.
The shares closed 39 ahead at 394p on active trading of 4.1m, after Smiths
reported a rise in profits from Pounds 102.2m to Pounds 104.6m, against
market predictions of around Pounds 99m.
Strauss Turnbull raised its current year forecast by Pounds 5m to Pounds
110m, although many are predicting profits for this year of Pounds 115m. Mr
Mustapha Omar at Williams de Broe, a long-time bull of the stock, is
sticking to his forecast at the top end of the range at Pounds 119m.
He said: 'Even after today's share price move, Smiths' price/earnings ratio
for the current year is still at a discount to the market. There is scope
for a cyclical bounce in earnings in the industrial division which will
benefit profits.'
A clutch of recommendations lifted Commercial Union, the shares advancing 11
to 636p. Brokers at Credit Lyonnais Laing were said to be positive on the
stock, as are those at Smith New Court. Mr Steven Bird at Smith believes
'the market continues to undervalue its life operations and it has yield
attractions as well'.
The market trend helped to produce a bounce in the rest of the composites.
General Accident put on 6 at 713p, while Royal Insurance finished 4 ahead at
323p, Sun Alliance gained 5 at 384p and Guardian Royal Exchange moved
forward 5 to 216p.
Sentiment began to strengthen around BP, and US buyers were reported to be
active again in the stock. Kleinwort Benson also added their voice to the BP
support with a buy note. The shares climbed 6 to 339 1/2 p.
Burmah Castrol rose forcefully in a generally upbeat oil sector. The shares
added 15 at 775p a day after the announcement by BZW of an auction of just
over 1m of the shares from the company's recent enhanced scrip dividend.
Second line oil stocks again proved popular. Enterprise Oil firmed 4 to 503p
and Hardy Oil put on 4 at 180p. Premier Consolidated Oilfields ended 2 up at
24 3/4 p on exploration news.
Shell Transport went against the sector trend and lost 2 to 706p. In
Kleinwort's buy advice on BP it had urged a hold position on Shell.
The strong market trend helped international conglomerate BTR overcome a
reported profits downgrade from agency broker James Capel. However, it was
said to have remained positive on the stock. The shares hardened 4 to 366p
in strong business of 7m.
Yield buyers were seen for international group Hanson, helping the shares
rise 4 to 273p in trade of 11m.
Bank of Scotland appreciated 6 to 192p after Kleinwort Benson advised
investors to buy the stock. Analysts at the securities house believe its
'growth potential has been underestimated by the market'.
Further profit-taking in Standard Chartered saw the shares relinquish 14 to
1004p. Bargain hunters on the back of the strong market trend brought a
bounce to National Westminster shares, 3 higher at 562p, and Barclays, which
gained 4 to 562p.
BT's drive forward continued, with Hoare Govett voicing its enthusiasm in
the wake of news of the group's move into the potentially lucrative video
market. The shares added 8 at 472p. Profit-taking continued in Cable and
Wireless, off 4 at 948p, and Vodafone, down 14 at 546p, with Lehman Brothers
said to have downgraded profits expectations.
There was lumpy turnover in Scottish Power, up 7 at 410p, which reached 8.8m
by the close.
Stores responded well to the latest retail sales figures and continued hopes
of an interest rate cut. Argos rose 5 to 349p, Body Shop 5 to 205p, Dixons 4
to 281p, Kingfisher 5 to 647p, Next 6 to 195p and Storehouse 2 to 206p.
Marks and Spencer received an additional boost from a Goldman Sachs upgrade,
climbing 6 to 406p.
Engineering group FKI bounced 4 to 173p after NatWest Securities came out
with a favourable note following the recent analysts' visit to the company's
US operation.
NatWest said: 'The group's ability to improve margins, generate a
substantial amount of cash, and effectively redeploy that cash into bolt-on
acquisitions . . . means that we remain convinced that there is scope for
further outperformance over the long term.'
The announcement by Wellcome of test results for its antiviral drug
Valaciclovir saw the shares rise 11 1/2 to 786 1/2 p.
A negative note from Goldman Sachs was said to have undermined Granada
Group, which slipped back 6 to 482p.
Bass, up 5 at 481p, was helped by reports of NatWest Securities moving from
negative to neutral on the stock.
ICI retreated 18 to 709p in moderate volume of 1.8m, with James Capel
reaffirming its negative stance.

FT  21 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: WH Smith strong

<TEXT>
With the executive changes at WH Smith largely discounted prior to
yesterday's agm, the probability of a share restructuring became the main
focus of investor interest. The high-voting 'B' shares immediately jumped to
a hefty premium, with analysts reporting guarded comments from Smith
directors to the effect that the dual structure will probably be reformed
once the 'B' shares regain a healthy premium to the 'A' stock.
The 'B's have five times the voting rights of the 'A's, with both prices
generally reflecting this gap. However, the board hints over the 'B's sent
the tightly traded category - which has large tranches held by directors and
family - sharply forward, closing 6 ahead at 98p. The 'A's added 9 at 479p.
Stores specialists said the retirement of Sir Simon Hornby and the top-level
reshuffle that will follow is unlikely to have any effect on the Smith
management style.

FT  21 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG speculation regarding board changes at Lasmo, the independent oil
exploration group, left the shares trailing the market yesterday. They
finished a turbulent session off 3 1/2 at 137 1/2 p, after 136p, as the
company denied that the finance director was about to resign. A company
spokesman said: 'There is no truth at all in the story.'
The rumour of the departure of Mr Michael Pavia as Lasmo finance chief is
said to have rumbled in market circuits for some time, but it was yesterday
boosted by provincial brokers. Some market watchers have dismissed the
revival of the speculation as an effort to head off a good performance in
the shares.
One industry watcher said that the resignation of Mr Pavia would not be
surprising and that the finance director was one of a couple of top
executives seen as vulnerable since Lasmo's acquisition of Ultramar in late
1991. Although he added: 'It would be a bit of a retrospective action.'
Market talk in the summer that Mr John Walmsley, the former finance director
of Enterprise Oil, could be attracted to such a position at Lasmo was given
a new lease of life. Trading in Lasmo stock was above average at 5m.

FT  21 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities continue to hit new peaks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK SHARE prices resumed their upward path yesterday, with the FT-SE 100
Index bursting through into new territory and reaching fresh intraday and
closing peaks.
The latest upsurge was fuelled by encouraging economic news, plus another
general advance by European bourses after Germany eased its money rate lower
in the wake of satisfactory money supply data.
Adding to a very confident mood around the equity market was the
exceptionally strong performance of gilt-edged stocks after news that there
will be no gilts auction in November, which some market strategists said
would release something like Pounds 3bn worth of institutional cash
otherwise earmarked for gilts.
Dealers said the market had been gripped by the improved chances of a series
of European interest rate cuts, possibly starting today when the Bundesbank
council meets to consider monetary policy in the wake of the money supply
figures for September.
The trading session in London was featured by a sharp increase in the number
of trading programmes and basket trades being executed by the big securities
houses. A large programme trade carried out by one of the big UK houses was
said to have been behind Tuesday's fall in UK share prices, but yesterday
saw a flurry of buy programmes, and a significant amount of basket trading,
where dealers arbitrage between the Footsie future and cash market.
Share prices began the day on a cautious note, with dealers marking the
leaders lower after the largely uninspiring performance of Wall Street
overnight and concern over the day's economic news.
But buyers quickly moved into the marketplace, gaining the upper hand and
driving shares higher. They first made their presence felt in the futures
market and the effects quickly filtered through into the cash market, where
the FT-SE 100 saw an initial loss of around five points transformed into a
20-point plus rise in mid-morning, after the September retail sales and
money supply news had been digested.
A dull start by Wall Street caused few problems for London and the FT-SE
100, having reached an intraday high of 3,156.9, settled a net 26.7 stronger
at 3,156.3. The FT-SE Mid 250 closed 20.3 up at 3,507.1.
Turnover expanded rapidly throughout the session, eventually reaching 744.1m
shares, with non-Footsie stocks accounting for around 62 per cent of that
total. The value of customer business transacted in London on Tuesday was a
hefty Pounds 1.7bn, well ahead of usual levels and an indicator that the big
institutions had continued as aggressive purchasers of UK stocks.
The widely held view among many senior traders in London is that the Footsie
could still have considerable upside, possibly to 3,250, in the short term.
'You cannot ignore the weight of money, but perhaps now might be the time to
start to lock in profits,' said one of the leading marketmakers at a UK
house. Another was concerned that some of the 'short-term US money' may move
on to other European markets. But all agreed that the big UK institutions
saw no reason to pick the top of the market.
Mr Nick Knight, strategist at Nomura and one of the market's biggest bulls,
reaffirmed his message yesterday: '3,500 here we come.'

FT  21 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRENGTH returned to the Footsie futures yesterday, with trading sending the
December contract upwards for most of the session, writes Christine Buckley.
It opened a point up from the previous day's close at 3,149 and pushed on
with a rally that gained momentum until it touched 3,183 at midday.
Traders were mainly in a positive mind with their sights set again on
anticipated interest rate cuts. The retail sales figures further buoyed
their optimism.
After lunch there was a small change of fortune, mainly triggered by selling
from independent traders wishing to send the contract lower. But with most
investors resisting similar action,it showed little signs of a downward
intention. The independents then tried to recoup losses and began buying the
contract.
December finished at 3,177 - a gain of 28 on the day and just over 5 points
ahead of its fair value premium to the cash market which stands at about 15
points.
Volume was 9,149 - slightly above the average for recent sessions.
Traded options again saw a significant amount of action in the index options
as traders hedge in anticipation of next month's Budget. Of the total of
35,965 lots dealt in traded options, 11,850 were in the FT-SE 100 option and
5,063 in the Euro FT-SE.

<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices traded in a narrow range either side of opening values
yesterday as the equity markets continued to digest the latest third-quarter
corporate earnings news, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 9.78 at 3,645.10. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.14 easier at 466.07, while the American SE
composite finished 0.49 firmer at 476.59 and the Nasdaq composite off 0.46
at 768.25. NYSE volume reached 307m shares.
After several weeks of steady gains, and two days of heavy profit-taking,
the markets appear to be at a crossroads. In the absence of fresh economic
news, equity investors struggled to find a new direction yesterday. The bond
market was in solid form - the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond has
dropped to 5.821 per cent - but it failed to provide stocks with much
support.
Consequently, trading was uninspired and prices hovered around opening
values throughout the day. Overnight strength in foreign markets was largely
ignored and investors' attention was primarily fixed upon the latest batch
of quarterly results.
Among those reporting yesterday were two big technology companies, Digital
Equipment and Compaq. The former announced a wider than expected quarterly
loss, driving its shares down Dollars 1 to Dollars 35 1/8 . Compaq, however,
surpassed analysts' forecasts with its own profits announcement, and the
stock climbed Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 64 7/8 .
AMR, parent of American Airlines, rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 68 after the
group reported net income of Dollars 1.33 a share, a strong recovery from
the Dollars 1.32 a share loss incurred at the same stage a year ago. USAir,
however, was steady at Dollars 13 3/4 as investors were left unimpressed by
its third-quarter loss of Dollars 178m.
Bank stocks, hard hit by profit-taking and concern about lower lending rates
cutting into profit margins, rebounded handsomely. Citicorp advanced Dollars
1 5/8 to Dollars 37 3/8 , JP Morgan added Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 72 7/8 and
Chemical put on Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 41 3/8 . BankAmerica eased Dollars
1/8 to Dollars 42 1/2 after reporting flat third-quarter earnings.
Tobacco shares were weaker, undermined by reports that President Bill
Clinton has decided upon a 75 cents a pack increase in the cigarette tax.
Philip Morris shed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 51 7/8 , American Brands gave up
Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 33 5/8 and RJR Nabisco eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars
4 7/8 .
On the Nasdaq market, Microsoft rose initially and then fell before rallying
to end a net Dollars  3/4 up at Dollars 81, as investors nervously awaited
the third-quarter results, which were due out after the close.
Canada
TORONTO finished slightly higher after busy trading. The TSE 300 index
gained 7.6 at 4,182.2 and rises outnumbered declines by 382 to 359. Volume
was 67.7m shares.
Despite the index rise, however, 10 of the 14 sub-indices were lower, led by
transportation, off 1.5 per cent. Golds climbed 2.7 per cent as the New York
bullion price rose USDollars 3.55 to USDollars 372.55 an ounce.

FT  21 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt, Zurich back at
record highs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A mixture of performances were seen yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT turned forward once again to set a new record close following the
release of satisfactory M3 data and a slight easing in the repo rate.
Nevertheless, the market is not anticipating a cut in the discount rate at
the regular meeting of the Buba council today, believing that the bank will
wait for the release of inflation data before committing itself, perhaps on
November 4.
The DAX index added 15.80 to 2,042.56. Turnover was DM9.8bn.
Daimler was DM3 stronger at DM743 by the close, with news that Deutsche
Aerospace planned to make substantial job cuts by 1996 coming in the after
market.
ZURICH returned to record breaking territory after Tuesday's brief
consolidation and the SMI index added 7.7 to 2,668.4 in active trading.
Nestle, benefiting from the strength of the dollar, continued its advance,
adding SFr9 to SFr1,183 in active trading.
PARIS was beset by technical problems during the session and the CAC-40
index closed just 2.36 ahead at 2,149.68.
News that Cap-Gemini, Chargeurs and Club Med were to be dropped from the
index from November 17 depressed their prices: falling respectively by
FFr13.40, FFr52 and FFr26 to FFr185.10, FFr1,145 and FFr358.
The replacements, BNP, CLF and Promodes, gained FFr1.80, FFr15.50 and FFr60
to FFr278.90, FFr439.50 and FFr1,010.
MILAN remained preoccupied with Fiat although renewed interest emerged in
the broader market and the Comit index edged 0.69 lower to 588.25.
Arbitrage trade between the shares and rights left Fiat L12 lower at L3,850.
BCI rose L27 to L4,522 and Credito Italiano eased L14 to L2,301 as analysts
awaited clarification of comments by the prime minister that a 3 per cent
shareholder limit after the banks were privatised did not exclude the
forming of 'hard core' shareholder blocks. He added that investors wanting
to take such positions would have to pay a premium for their stakes.
Speculative buying took Montedison L15.70 higher to L854.60 in heavy volume
of 10.9m shares.
AMSTERDAM enjoyed another record breaking day with the CBS Tendency index
finishing up 1.4 or 1 per cent at 133.9.
KLM strengthened on US buying with the shares adding Fl 1.70 to Fl 42.50.
The publishing sector was also firmer, with Elsevier up Fl 2.70 to Fl
149.20, helped by news that the UK had cleared its purchase of the Official
Airlines guide, VNU rising Fl 3.20 to Fl 145.80 and Wolters Kluwer up Fl
2.00 to Fl 106.50.
Akzo was one of the day's losers, down Fl 2.80 at Fl 181.60.
STOCKHOLM was pulled lower by Ericsson and Volvo. The Affarsvarlden general
index closed down 11.5 at 1,385.5.
Ericsson shed SKr17 to SKr440 while Volvo slipped SKr16 to SKr413 following
its announcement of details of its buy-out for BCP. Procordia lost SKr6 to
SKr230.
MADRID finished near its highs for the day, lifted by an easing of one-year
treasury bond yields, and the general index rose 2.93 to 303.1. Endesa added
Pta180 to Pta6,000 in response to the company's forecast on Tuesday that
group profit would rise by 5-10 per cent in 1993.
COPENHAGEN climbed to a new year's high with Novo Nordisk up DKr4 to DKr630
and the KFX index rising 1.16 to 101.95.

INDEX-LINKED buying by arbitrageurs and purchases of large-capital stocks by
public funds lifted share prices, and the Nikkei average closed moderately
higher, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average gained 103.51 at 20,173.42, having opened at the day's
low of 20,054.21 before rising to the high for the session of 20,221.72 in
late morning trading.
Volume amounted to 224m shares, against 206m. Traders said investors would
remain quiet until Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's political reform bill
passed through parliament. 'Once the bill is approved, the government will
be able to concentrate on measures to boost the economy,' said one Japanese
broker.
Overall falls retained a narrow lead over advances by 494 to 483, with 195
issues unchanged, but the Topix index of all first section stocks rose 3.40
to 1,647.86. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 0.73 at 1,286.54.
Dealers said the Nikkei index has been stunted for the past few weeks due to
selling by corporate investors, with small-lot buying support only coming
from public funds and arbitrageurs. Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities said:
'Companies are expected to sell about Y1,000bn during the remainder of the
fiscal year to March.'
Among the large-capital stocks, Nippon Steel, the day's most active issue,
firmed Y1 to Y332 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries gained Y4 at Y679.
High-technology exporters were bought as beneficiaries of the yen's recent
easing against the dollar. Sony advanced Y70 to Y4,830 and Matsushita
Electric Industrial Y10 to Y1,510.
Heiwa, the pachinko pinball machine maker listed on the second section which
is currently under police investigation, fell Y500 to Y3,450. Other
leisure-related stocks were also weak, with Sega Enterprises down Y120 to
Y9,750.
Telecom linked shares continued to sag on profit-taking. Nippon Telegraph
and Telephone slipped Y10,000 to Y884,000, and Fujitsu was off Y2 at Y861.
Railway linked stocks were higher ahead of the listing of East Japan Railway
next Tuesday. Nippon Signal rose Y40 to Y1,550 and Keihin Electric Express
Railway Y18 to Y753.
In Osaka, the OSE average receded 43.83 to 22,156.12 in volume of 20.3m
shares.
Roundup
MANY of the Pacific Rim markets continued to consolidate.
HONG KONG finished modestly ahead after a session that had seen the Hang
Seng index swing between a 120-point deficit and a 100-point gain. The index
finished 41.39 higher at 8,902.80 in turnover that shrank to HKDollars
7.29bn from Tuesday's HKDollars 9.55bn.
Mr Michael Paterson of Asia Equity commented that blue chips had been
overbought and the market was broadening out into second liners and
derivative instruments which had been left behind in the recent bull run. He
thought that the current correction was very healthy, adding that he did not
see the index moving upwards very far from its current level for the time
being.
HSBC, which topped the actives list, was down 50 cents at HKDollars 87,
after slipping to a low of HKDollars 86 following news of a provision for
its Samuel Montagu unit.
AUSTRALIA pulled back to close weaker as profits were booked for the second
consecutive day, and the All Ordinaries index finished 23.8 lower at 2,051.7
in turnover of ADollars 412.2m.
The All Industrials index fell 35.7 to 3,179.6 and the All Resources 14.8 to
1,190.1. BHP ended 22 cents cheaper at ADollars 17.40, while News Corp
retreated 40 cents, or 3.4 per cent, to ADollars 11.26.
SEOUL was lower in continued reaction to recent advances, but renewed
interest in some shares with low price-to-book ratios neutralised much of an
early decline. The composite stock index lost a net 2.61 at 738.63 in
turnover of Won564.45bn.
TAIWAN saw late selling after a minor technical rally and the weighted index
ended 11.86 off at 3,958.32 in turnover that fell to TDollars 19.52bn.
SINGAPORE was easier on profit-taking, with sell-offs in selected index
shares and some speculative issues dragging the market lower. The Straits
Times Industrial index closed 12.42 down at 2,095.84, near the day's low of
2,093.07.
NEW ZEALAND lost ground, the NZSE-Capital index shedding 11.91 to 2,060.25.
Telecom, still suffering from Merrill Lynch's change of recommendation on
the stock, declined 7 cents to NZDollars 4.28.
MANILA, however, resumed its climb after Tuesday's respite, and the
composite index appreciated 46.79 to a record 2,205.78.
KARACHI kept up its forward momentum with a gain in the KSE-100 index of
28.14 to 1,478.57, writes Farhan Bokhari in Islamabad. The market was helped
by the victory of Ms Benazir Bhutto's PPP party in forming the government in
the Punjab, Pakistan's largest and wealthiest province.

FT  21 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: Argentina anticipates further strong
growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
EVERYTHING seems to be going right for Argentina. The economy is booming,
inflation is at a record low and the political scene is stable, after the
ruling Peronist party swept to its fourth consecutive electoral victory in
congressional elections on October 3.
The gods are even smiling on President Carlos Menem, whose very name
superstitious Argentines once considered unlucky. He emerged unscathed from
a helicopter crash earlier this month and is now recovering rapidly from
emergency surgery last week.
The stock market is storming ahead in a bull run that has driven prices up
by a quarter this year. Although this compares poorly with developed country
markets, much of the advance came during the last two months, with the
Merval market index rising 13 per cent since mid-August.
Prices dipped suddenly last Thursday on the news that Mr Menem was
undergoing surgery. The news broke just before the Buenos Aires market
closed, but was enough to depress prices in New York.
However, the market bounced back when it became clear that he was out of
danger. But New York's reaction showed that investor confidence in Argentina
still depends on two men: Mr Menem and Mr Domingo Cavallo, his economy
minister.
Foreign investors' views are more important than ever. It is international
liquidity that is driving the market forward, not local factors. If capital
inflows were to dry up, the market would go into reverse.
Corporate results are mediocre given that the economy is growing by 6 per
cent, after expanding by 9 per cent in 1992. Ambito Financiero, a local
business newspaper, commented this week that profits at the biggest listed
companies rose only 7.5 per cent in the second quarter.
Luckily, overseas investors - mostly US and London-based emerging market
fund managers - are looking further ahead. Many expect strong growth to
continue in Argentina for some time.
Mr Steve Darch, managing director at Banco Mariva, a Buenos Aires merchant
bank, said investors 'are buying where there is growth potential and the
potential is absolutely phenomenal. Look at a difficult industry like steel,
which had to go through a restructuring process: if you think the economy
will continue growing, even a non-sexy industry like steel will grow too'.
Sectors attracting greatest investor interest are energy,
telecommunications, food, construction and banking.
YPF, Argentina's biggest company, offers exposure both to the oil industry
and Argentina. Those who bought when it was floated in June have been
handsomely rewarded with a 47 per cent rise to Dollars 28 yesterday.
Investors are also encouraged by a decision at many companies to start
paying cash dividends.
This marks an important cultural change. The market expects companies to
provide consistent earnings as well as opportunities for specula-tive
capital gains. Capital-hungry companies are finding they can no longer
ignore minority shareholders.
But perhaps the most important event of the past month was congressional
approval of a private pension fund system. Pension funds are unlikely to
have an immediate impact. But with time they should broaden Argentina's
narrow and volatile market and reduce its dangerous reliance on foreign
capital.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Money Markets: Short sterling stronger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT sterling yesterday shrugged off any implications from a bigger than
expected rise in retail sales that base rates might not have to fall, writes
Peter John.
The futures contract for December delivery concentrated on the view that an
improvement in economic growth would make a tax rise at the Budget more
likely. Economists expect any increase in taxes to be cushioned by easier
rates.
December futures hit a high of 94.66 yesterday and closed two basis points
firmer on the day at 94.62. The nearer the price gets to 100 the more it
discounts lower three-month lending and base rates.
Gains in the UK were at odds with the performance of the principal
short-term interest rate futures contracts for continental Europe. The
D-Mark contract for December slipped 0.7 of a point to 93.74 as German
securities repurchase operations saw bids from the banks accepted at 6.77
per cent at the lowest level, rather than 6.65 per cent as hoped.
Also, the latest German money supply data came in slightly higher than
expected and dampened hopes of an imminent reduction in key German interest
rates.
A German cut is seen as the spark which will set off a general trend of
much-needed interest rate reductions, particularly in France. The French
three-month contract was also weaker yesterday, closing 0.7 lower at 93.47.
Operations in the UK money markets returned to a more comfortable level
yesterday as a forecast liquidity shortage of Pounds 1.75bn was more or less
dealt with at the earliest opportunity.
Among the main factors affecting the shortage, later revised down to Pounds
1.7bn, were the take-up of Treasury Bills and paper maturing in official
hands which drained Pounds 1.171bn from the system, bills for repurchase by
the market, which took out Pounds 231m, and Exchequer transactions, which
drained Pounds 95m. A rise in note circulation took up another Pounds 125m,
while bankers' balances below target removed Pounds 105m.
The Bank of England pro-vided Pounds 1.553bn of bills at 5 29/32 per cent
for resale to the market on November 9 and 10. It gave a further Pounds 75m
of assistance at midday, via band one bank bills at the established 5 7/8
per cent rate.
Finally, the Bank provided Pounds 106m in the afternoon, via bills at 5 7/8
per cent, bringing total help to Pounds 1.714bn.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange: DM suffers further weakness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-MARK fell against the dollar and was under pressure against several
European currencies yesterday, in spite of signals which diverted attention
away from rate cut hopes and, consequently, should have helped the currency,
writes Peter John.
Initially, German data gave some lift to the D-Mark. M3 money supply growth
came in at 7 per cent for September, against 7.2 per cent the previous
month, but still above the market consensus of 6.9 per cent. As the
Bundesbank has said it would not cut rates unless money supply was on
target, the slightly higher figure saw the currency pick up by more than
1/2 pfennig from its close in New York.
Then, the weekly securities repurchase was carried out with the lower level
only reaching 6.77 per cent. There had been hopes that the Bundesbank would
accept bids as low as 6.65 per cent from the commercial banks and the higher
figure was seen as dampening hopes of easier rates. The market ignored a
higher than anticipated injection of liquidity.
However, this coincided with a large sale of D-Marks for dollars, believed
to have come from a German corporation. That sell order set the tone of the
day and ensured that the US currency rose above DM1.65, through its recent
trading range.
There was a flurry of excitement that the dollar, further boosted by
Tuesday's encouraging figures on housing, had achieved a 'chart break-out'.
But Mr Avinash Persaud, an economist with JP Morgan, reflected the
considered view when he said: 'It was a rally largely built on sand.'
By the end of the day the D-Mark had recovered to DM1.6450 to the dollar,
still below the previous European close of DM1.6370. In New York it finished
at DM1.6387.
The D-Mark's early fall gave some respite for the beleaguered French and
Belgian currencies yesterday, but any doubts on a German rate cut are bound
to spill over into the franc economies, which desperately need easier
monetary policy to stimulate growth.
The Belgian currency reached BFr21.784 to the D-Mark at best, but worries
over the social pact on wages and jobs were not dispelled by details
released on Tuesday and the currency slipped back to finish at BFr21.86,
down from BFr21.82. The French franc rallied to FFr3.5285 to the D-Mark but
closed at FFr3.5350, against FFr3.5320 previously.
Sterling received a boost from stronger retail sales figures than the market
had forecast. A rise of 0.5 per cent in the sales volume for September
helped the pound against several currencies, although a  3/4 pfennig rise to
DM2.45 was largely a manifestation of a weaker German currency. The pound
rallied from a low of Dollars 1.4850 to end at Dollars 1.49, against a
previous Dollars 1.4920. The sterling exchange rate index, which measures
the pound against a basket of leading currencies, rose from 79.7 to 79.9.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Survey of Luxembourg (7): Life business has doubled in the
past year - Elizabeth Wise investigates the multi-lingual insurance sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ELIZABETH WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE life insurance business has doubled in the past year and insurers are
still arriving in force to join firms from Europe, Japan and the United
States.
If Dublin's new status as an insurance paradise causes Luxembourg any worry,
it doesn't show. Business is booming, says Mr Victor Rod, director of
Luxembourg's insurance commission, which serves as regulator and supervisor
for 70 insurance companies and 185 reinsurers working in the country.
While the list of direct insurance companies includes well-known names -
from Belgium's AssuBel to Switzerland's Winterthur - almost all the
reinsurance operating in Luxembourg are captives - insurance wings of
industrial companies, banks or commercial institutions set up to insure
themselves. 'All our names are big names', Mr Rod says.
'There are a couple of British names extremely interested,' he adds, but
declines to name them - hinting that he is competing with Dublin.
Dublin has been a challenge ever since Ireland cut its tax rate to 10 per
cent for insurance firms which would set up shop in Dublin's docklands
before 1994 and employ at least 10 workers. But the tax break ends in 2004.
Mr Rod admits that the Grand Duchy may have lost some key prospective
customers to the Irish capital, and Luxembourg applications have waned
slightly. But he says that there is no serious threat from Dublin, adding:
'They consider us much more as competition than we do them'.
He feels the establishment of Europe's single market has secured
Luxembourg's position on the insurance map. As insurers seek to attract
customers around the European continent, he predicts that they will opt for
a branch in Luxembourg with a multilingual staff able to market products in
various countries.
'Try to sell a policy written in English to a Frenchman,' he challenges,
arguing that a single, Luxembourgeois sales force can sell to clients in
France, Germany and Belgium. He says that some British insurers are
considering forming subsidiaries in Luxembourg, because marketing to the
rest of Europe might be easier if it's not 'too British'.
Insurers from several EC states are forming joint ventures to win business
their national regulations will not allow - or simply to win a
not-so-domestic image palatable to foreign customers, Mr Rod says. 'They
could do it from France or from Germany. But they prefer a neutral base'.
Life insurance business in Luxembourg grew by 148 per cent in a single year,
Mr Rod claims, as a result of the establishment of new, pan-European
companies which use the (EC) free movement of services to serve clients in
several countries. Life insurance premium income rose to LFr14.6bn in 1992
from LFr5.9bn francs a year earlier. Mr Rod predicts another doubling in
1993, and 'dramatic increases in the coming years'. Non-life insurers took
in LFr19.5bn francs last year.
He also says that the new ventures are bringing new products to the market.
British-style, high-yield USITS, or investment fund linked policies, are
finding their way on to the continent.
'There is a healthy mix which could give some interesting cross ideas,' says
Mr Tim Yeates, managing director of the Luxembourg branch of Unisom
Management, a company managing some 400 reinsurance companies worldwide.
The tradition of discretion in banking also applies to insurance companies,
and insurers benefit - just as banks do - from the absence of withholding
tax.
But entering Luxembourg's insurance market costs more than in other choice
spots. The minimum capital is LFr50m, 10 times what it costs to set up in
Bermuda. And management must be domiciled in the Grand Duchy in order to
avoid what Mr Rod calls 'letter box' business.
Insurers come under Luxembourg's 39 per cent tax bracket, but they may put
nearly all their profits into tax deductable 'reserves', or savings for
eventual payments in case of catastrophe. Taxable income, therefore, is next
to nothing. 'It's much more a tax holiday than a tax freedom,' Mr Rod
explains. Any reserves remaining when the insurance policy expires, are
taxed.
Insurance companies held LFr65bn in investments in Luxembourg last year, up
from LFr48bn in deposits in 1991. Reinsurance firms had LFr120bn worth of
reserves deposted in 1991.
The drawback of putting profits into reserves is that firms may not dip into
profits to pay dividends. Mr Rod admits that companies wanting quick returns
might be better served in Dublin, where firms see their profits each year.
But reserves keep companies from closing under the weight of catastrophe
payments, he says, adding: 'Those companies which really are confronted with
catastrophic exposure in the long run have every interest in coming to
Luxembourg.'
Luxembourg has an interest in getting those companies, too. Insurance,
maritime and stock exchange structures were set up to expand the financial
centre. Banks here 'get a big share of these investments' made by insurers,
and because nearly two thirds of premium income is ploughed into bonds, the
business is also good for Luxembourg's stock exchange.
Luxembourg may not win a reputation as an insurance capital, says Mr Rod.
'The insurance community will never be as important as the banking
community, but it's growing, and it's growing very fast'.
As for the Dublin challenge, Mr Yeates says that insurance services offered
by the two cities need not detract from one another - and may be
complementary. As for Mr Rod, he feels his country's position in the field
is secure.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Survey of Luxembourg (6): Just a little Letzebuergesch as
she is spoke - Jul Christophory gets to grips with the Grand Duchy's local
lingo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUL CHRISTOPHORY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LETZEBUERGESCH is the language of everyday communication of Luxembourgers
with each other. Foreign observers have always been at a loss to pigeon-hole
the one language really spoken in Luxembourg by native Luxembourgers.
At first sight, the country's linguistic situation seems to be a curious
cocktail of three idioms mixed with a large foreign population - and
influenced by the pragmatism of its inhabitants, much to the confusion of
many Luxembourgers themselves.
Nowadays, when 'Jos', 'Pit' or 'Mich' dials a number, he (or she) will first
inquire whether the person on the other end of the line speaks
Letzebuergesch or not. Half the time, he/she will not - nearly half of the
working population is foreign.
In Parliament, official announcements are made in French but most of the
debates are held in Letzebuergesch. Parliamentary documents and draft laws,
as well as their published texts, are also in French. If they are destined
for a wider public circulation, they are translated into German (and
increasingly, into Portuguese).
Most newspapers are written in German, with some French articles, mainly in
the arts section.
Government offices use French as far as possible, but are supposed to answer
letters in the language of the inquirer, be it German, French or
Letzebuergesch.
In church, German is the primary language.
In the courts, French is the dominant language. (Lawyers who plead in
Letzebuergesch are still considered mavericks.)
In primary schools and in the junior classes of the lycees, German tends to
be the language of instruction - only to be replaced by French as the
language of instruction for middle school and senior classes.
Letzebuergesch will not normally be used for teaching purposes, but teachers
use it for informal conversation - and pupils are always reprimanded in
Letzebuergesch.
Nobody would ever speak French or German in public unless addressing a
foreign guest.
However, in many a high street, when ordering a beer in a bar or inquiring
in a shop, you may wish to speak French because nowadays most staff come
from France, Belgium or Portugal.
This seemingly intractable state of affairs is deeply rooted in history.
Up to 1839 the Duchy's territory was situated on the dividing line of the
Germanic and Roman languages; it consisted of two geographical parts: one
French and one Germanic (that is, Letzebuergesch) speaking region.
When the French-speaking region was incorporated into neighbouring Belgium
in 1839, and Luxembourg was reduced to its present size, bilingualism still
prevailed - with a strong preference for French, especially among the
educated elites.
Letzebuergesch remained the language of everyday communication. German (as
in Switzerland) was the written expression of a dialect rooted in peasant
culture.
Increasingly, though, Luxembourgers now consider Letzebuergesch to have
achieved the status of a language per se. For Letzebuergesch is alive and
well, spoken by almost 100 per cent of the native population. Novels and
poetry are written in it;, films are shot in it; Asterix and Tintin -
beloved heroes of children's stories - are translated into it; local radio
broadcasting is thriving in it. Since last year there has been a one-hour
daily news bulletin in Letzebuergesch on television.
In a rapidly evolving Europe, Letzebuergesch has become Luxembourg's one
real symbol of national identity. This stems from the the second world war.
A plebiscite was forced upon the country by the occupying forces; the Nazis
implied that, in answer to the question asking which language was spoken,
Luxembourgers should specify German. When it became clear that a whispering
campaign was spreading the word that everyone should specify
'Letzebuergesch', the Germans called off their plebiscite.
Since that time - as a reflection of its weariness about being bullied
around by foreign powers - Letzebuergesch has come to personify the
Luxembourg spirit.
What, then, is Letzebuergesch like?
For linguists it is the western-most branch of Moselle Franconian
(Moselfrankisch): it originated with the invasion of the Rhenish and North
Sea Franks who began to settle around the river Moselle during the 3rd
century AD.
In layman's terms, this means that its consonants are roughly halfway
between High German and Dutch. Its vowels are something else altogether. And
there are syntactical particularities.
To regard Letzebuergesch simply as a predominantly Germanic dialect,
however, is to tell only half the story. Even in its heyday - in the 15th
century, when a Luxembourger sat on the throne of the Holy Roman Empire -
the lands of the Dukes of Luxembourg contained more French than German
speakers.
Luxembourg has therefore always looked westwards, and this is reflected in
its vocabulary ('d'fotell': le fauteuil in French: armchair), and in an
enormous number of verbs ending in '-eieren' (for example: 'proposeieren'),
devised whenever Luxembourgers need a new word and do not want to look to
Germany to find it. For most Luxembourgers, German is as much a foreign
language as French.
Thanks to its position as the language of a sovereign state, Letzebuergesch
has managed to avoid the decline suffered by other 'little' languages of
Europe. By a law of 1984, it has officially become Luxembourg's national
language. (An 'official' spelling had already been introduced in 1975 - but
most Luxembourgers do not really care; they go on writing phonetically.
Foreign residents in Luxembourg know how important it is to know the
language - be it only to catch bits of local gossip at the village stores.
Language courses are thriving. As a result of the sorry state of Luxembourg
demographics, there may be fewer Luxembourgers, but there is an
ever-increasing number of Letzebuergesch speakers.
An important political party has even considered whether Letzebuergesch
should be elevated to the status of official language for the European
Community - with the proviso that Luxembourg itself would refrain from
insisting that it be used as a working language. But who knows?

FT  21 OCT 93 / Survey of Luxembourg (4): Last year's profits flowed like
wine - The banks have proved resilient in the face of increasing competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS month's gala reception in the spa town of Mondorf-les-Bains was a
glittering occasion for the Grand Duchy's leading bankers. Mr Jacques
Santer, Luxembourg's prime minister, was present; so was Crown Prince Henri.
The wine flowed almost as fast as the past year's profits.
This has been an outstanding year for Luxembourg's banks. The industry
proved much more resilent than expected in the face of increasing
competition and the sharp economic downturn among its neighbours,
particularly Germany.
Yet behind the story of steady expansion, there are nagging concerns.
Fresh efforts to introduce an EC-wide withholding tax threaten one of the
cornerstones of the industry. At the same time, there may be less to the
surge in 1992 profits than meets the eye - it was almost certainly inflated
by the influx of German savings seeking a safe haven from the Bonn
government's tax net.
The Luxembourg Bankers Association (ABBL), the principal organisation
representing the industry, has grasped the danger of being branded a tax
haven whose principal strength lies in exploiting fiscal anomalies within
the EC. It has come up with a three-pronged counter-attack.
First, the ABBL argues that the Grand Duchy may be ready to strike a deal on
withholding tax, but only if the new arrangements cover OECD countries. This
means Switzerland, as well as tax havens such as the Channel Islands,
Gibraltar, Lichtenstein and Monaco.
Second, the ABBL has launched a campaign to convince the rest of the world
that Luxembourg's investment in technology, innovation and training means
that its status as a leading financial centre is secure, even if Europe's
politicians choose to tinker with the tax rules.
Third, the Association is trying, with some success, to reduce the
industry's high cost base. This means introducing much more flexibility into
salaries to reflect responsibility and performance and break the traditional
link with inflation.
Occasionally the campaign errs on the over-optimistic side. A recent survey
by Arthur Andersen, the international management consultants, concluded that
Luxembourg's banking industry was entering a period of consolidation; but it
also reported a remarkable confidence among executives working for the Grand
Duchy's financial institutions.
Looking ahead to the year 2000, the survey cheerfully predicted that the
amount of funds under management could reach Dollars 750bn; operating
profits could amount to Dollars 5.3bn; and staffing would be about 20,000.
Meanwhile, the number of banks was likely to rise from the present 220 to
more than 250. Yet the survey also acknowledged that these headline figures
assumed an unchanged fiscal and regulatory environment.
Some may disagree that this is a 'reasonable' assumption; others would
concede, however, that the industry has matured over the past 10 years as it
has developed new services in private banking, custodial services, and
financial instruments.
During this period, there has been a steady move away from reliance on
interest income, where margins are being squeezed by competition as a source
of revenue.
In 1992, net interest income grew by 8 per cent only; it also dropped as a
share of gross results to 70.8 per cent, the lowest level ever recorded - a
shift which can be explained largely by highly profitable foreign exchange
and securities trading. Like London and New York, Luxembourg knew how to
exploit the recent upheaval in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.
Mr Chris Cottrell, head of the Fleming Flagship Fund, whose total net assets
passed Dollars 1bn this year, says that Luxembourg's chief attraction lies
in its proximity to the French and German markets and its ability to
implement legislation without delay. This was true of the investment fund
law in 1989; but it will also apply to the new USITS unit trust legislation
scheduled to come into force next July.
Flemings employs 120 staff from 14 different countries. This same
multilingual, multinational spirit infuses leading local banks such as
Banque Generale de Luxembourg. 'We hire good young people,' says Mr Paul
Meyers, a senior executive, 'and we invest heavily in information
technology.'
Banque Generale's development shows how it has diversified from its more
traditional business of supporting local industry, as shown by its
continuing minority equity stake in Arbed, the steel-maker. The Luxembourg
bank recently set up the Northumberland Group in the UK which employs 40
people specialising in Personal Equity Pensions; and it has expanded its
expertise in fund administration to the point where it has 295 compartments
managing more than 100 funds.
Among US banks in Luxembourg, Chase Manhattan offers an example of the
development of private banking services. Chase's target market is the
individual with a minimum of Dollars 1 million capital. (Exceptions are made
if the client has Dollars 500,000 and has good prospects of quickly hitting
the Dollars 1m mark). Many of Chase's clients are owners of small and
medium-sized businesses in neighbouring Belgium, France and Germany.
Mr Pierfranco de Vita, general manager of Chase's private banking branch,
which reports to a head office in Geneva, says that clients are attracted at
the prospect of being able to tap into Chase's other services such as
corporate finance. 'Most of the clients are already offshore, so it's not
new money,' he says, 'but we are offering all-round services.'
Chase's self-styled 'Know Your Client' policy is a useful marketing tool in
the wake of the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce (BCCI), whose
operations remained for a long time a mystery not only to Luxembourg
authorities but also to the Bank of England.
Mr Pierre Jaans, the head of the Luxembourg Monetary Institute, (IML) the
Grand Duchy's financial regulator, says the authorities are now much better
equipped to deal with rogue banks such as BCCI.
Last April, the second EC banking directive and the money laundering
directive passed into law - supported by IML circulars on solvency ratios
and so-called 'own funds'. Mr Jaans argues that BCCI was a legacy of a much
more lax regulatory environment in the 1970s, which was true of Europe as a
whole.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Survey of Luxembourg (5): A listener who both lends and
borrows big - The European Investment Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS a founder member of the European Community, Luxembourg has never been shy
of making a pitch for a new EC institution.
Its campaign to capture the future European central bank has drawn much
attention, but this has tended to obscure the presence in the Grand Duchy of
an increasingly powerful international financial institution in its own
right: the European Investment Bank (EIB).
The EIB's central task is to provide long-term finance to promote economic
integration in the EC, most recently through the completion of the Single
European market. But the bank is moving rapidly into new areas, ranging from
the provision of funds for telecommunications networks in Bulgaria to the
management of Euratom money for making nuclear reactors safe in the former
Soviet Union.
Today, the EIB's lending and borrowing is bigger than the World Bank.
It has a leading role in the European Commission's growth initiative to get
the European economy under way; and it has a forceful new president, Sir
Brian Unwin, a former head of the UK Customs and Excise who spent the last
part of a 30-year-long career in Whitehall battling alongside Mrs Thatcher
for a bigger EC budget rebate for Britain.
It is tempting to suggest that Sir Brian is a poacher-turned-gamekeeper. He
prefers to describe himself as an EIB old boy, having earlier served as a
British nominee to the EIB board. Insiders predict that this experience will
make make him a good less circumspect about stamping his authority on the
institution and shaping relations with its political masters in Brussels.
'We need to be a more active,' said Sir Brian in an interview in late summer
in his Luxembourg office. 'Political control is in the European Community
and the apex is the council of ministers. But it is very important to play
an active role to shape the policy. The bank must be heard at all levels of
the EC structures.'
This suggests that the EIB has been to willing to play 'the listening bank'.
Its lack of political punch was underlined three years ago, when Chancellor
Helmut Kohl bowed to French pressure and agreed to set up the Bank for
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in London. Many believe
that the job would have been handled better by the EIB.
The new bank's new portfolio includes:
Operation of the new Ecus 2bn package of subsidised loans and grants set up
as part of the EC's deal with the European Free Trade Area states known as
in the European Economic Area (which excludes Switzerland);
A key role in the new Cohesion fund for Greece, Ireland, Spain and Portugal,
as well as the newly enlarged Structural funds agreed in the December 1992
seven-year EC budget deal;
Lead role in implementing the 1992 Edinburgh summit's growth package. This
includes a temporary lending facility of Ecu 5 bn earmarked for
trans-European networks in 1993 and 1994, particularly in telecoms,
transport and energy.
The Edinburgh agreement also covers a new financial instrument: the European
Investment Fund. This is a novel semi-government agency which will draw on
public and private capital to funnel finance to small and medium-sized
businesses.
At the latest count, some 30 banks are positively committed to subscribing
to the target of 30 per cent of the subscribed capital of Ecus 2bn, with the
rest supplied by the European Commission and the EIB itself.
There is, however, another explanation for the EIB's higher profile.
The EIB's shareholders - the 12 EC member states - have been less willing to
fund new infrastructure projects directly. With growing budget deficits and
increasing pressure to meet the Maastricht treaty's convergence criteria,
the emphasis is on fiscal constraint.
'We looked around and the EIB was the obvious source of capital,' says one
European Commission official.
The challenge is to ensure that his newly enlarged portfolio fits into the
Bank's core business: the promotion of greater economic cohesion in the EC,
mainly through high-quality loans and underwriting capacity. These are still
based on a triple A credit rating, which Sir Brian describes as the bank's
most precious asset.
Ten years ago, the only country outside the EC in which the EIB was involved
was Yugoslavia. Today it lends to African, Caribbean and Pacific countries
(ACP), as well as to Latin America, Asia and, increasingly, eastern Europe.
The EIB has also arranged a lending programme for the Baltic states - its
first move into the former Soviet Union.
Lending outside the EC area still accounts for only about 5 per cent of the
total loan portfolio. But it comes amid a significant expansion in the EIB's
overall activities. Between 1983 and 1992, lending has risen from Ecu 6bn to
Ecu 17bn. This year it could exceed Ecu 20b.
As Sir Brian pointed out in his inaugural address to shareholders, this
breakneck expansion has led to distortions. About one third of the staff,
which is nearly 800 strong, works on less than 10 per cent of the EIB's
lending. In other words, while lending has increased by 80 per cent over the
past five years, staff numbers grew by only 12 per cent. And the bank, says
Sir Brian, already has a formidable amount of business on its plate.
It faces a tricky diplomatic task in relations with other EC agencies such
as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the
European Commission; each has its own ideas on how best to promote the
integration of Europe, east and west.
But Sir Brian, who calls himself 'a lot of a European', has no intention of
'going native' like some of his fellow countrymen on the continent. There is
a strong practical edge to his character, coupled with a hard-headed
optimism about the future prospects of the EC. This is a man committed to
making the Community's often unwieldy institutions work.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Survey of Luxembourg (3): Continuous trading needed - The
Stock Exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ELIZABETH WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LUXEMBOURG'S stock exchange is home to the Eurobond. It was first issued in
1963, and is celebrating its 30th anniversary, but the tiny bourse is also
looking to the future, seeking to carve for itself a niche in the European
Community's single market.
It hopes to be sitting pretty through a period of less introverted trading
and more international activity - with an eye on the 1996 implementation of
an EC Investment Services Directive (ISD) which gives brokers a 'passport'
to trade throughout the EC, and a much-touted 'Eurolist' allowing important
securities to be simultaneously listed on various European exchanges.
'We were always based on transnational and transcontinental business,' says
Mr Edmond Israel. the bourse chairman. 'All developments leading to greater
efficiency for transnational business in Europe will enhance the business in
Luxembourg.'
Mr Israel, together with other officials in this tiny country wedged between
France, Germany and Belgium, is touting a tradition of international
expertise.
Between 75 per cent and 80 per cent of the world's outstanding Eurobonds are
listed in Luxembourg. While lower interest rates around Europe helped the
Eurobond market to break volume records, analysts noted its ability to
withstand currency turbulence.
With more than 10,000 securities denominated in 26 currencies, Luxembourg's
exchange is a significant part of a marketplace which hopes to take a
central position in Europe, and not just geographically. 'I think we are
well positioned for the future,' Mr Israel says.
That belief stems partly from the expectation that foreign banks and
international companies will continue to set up shop, taking advantage of
Luxembourg's flexible regulatory structure and its centrally located,
multi-lingual base. With some 200 banks already in the Grand Duchy, Mr
Israel sees 'quite a lot of potential here in the securities field.'
Even without the new EC rules integrating stock exchanges, he thinks the
1990s will be good for bourses; he anticipates a trend towards greater
equity investment. 'The stock exchanges have a big role to play in . . .
converting short term cash into long-term investment, which will contribute
to Europe's the economic development.'
Total trading volume in June rose to LFr23.34 bn, an increase of 22.49 per
cent over the first 1992 period. Mr Israel predicts that volume will
continue its climbing pace. 'By December 31 this year I would anticipate a
growth of between 25 and 30 per cent over last year.'
He also says that, thanks to Luxembourg's liberal trading tradition, the
volume of trading off the exchange 'exceeds by far' that of on-exchange
trading. Under the ISD, those transactions will have to be reported to a
central authority, increasing the bourse staff's workload.
Although he says the on-exchange turnover is 'extremely satisfactory,' it is
still one of Europe's smallest. Mr Israel wants 'to increase the
transactions more substantially.' That means computerising securities. While
nearly 800 securities are now being traded electronically, traders complain
that the computers are not always working.
Meanwhile, the old, open outcry system still prevails. Trading floor
activity is still limited to between 10.45am and 1.15pm - a disadvantage
compared to Paris, which trades between 10am and 5pm. Plans to extend the
Luxembourg exchange's hours have not yet borne fruit, but Mr Israel says:
'There's more than a fair chance that it will happen next year.' No decision
has yet been taken on which securities could be traded during extended
hours.
Traders say that another feature ripe for change is the manner in which
securities are called in succession on the exchange, allowing trading on a
particular bond or share only when it has been called. Securities also come
up one by one on trading screens. 'We absolutely must create a continuous
trading market throughout the working day,' complains one Luxembourg trader.
Luxembourg has continued on its path towards making investment funds a
speciality; it lists 1,915 domestic and foreign funds. But bond trading
constitutes the bulk of the exchange's activity, thanks mostly to listings
by foreign companies. With 855 new bonds listed since January, bond turnover
reached LFr15.48b in June.
Mr Israel says that he expects to see growth in Luxembourg franc and
Ecu-dominated bonds, as well as shares of 'major international investment
funds' which he declined to identify. He also foresees growth in equities,
'where next year the Eurolist shares could play a major role.'
Though the Ecu remains the most traded currency, it has slipped as the bond
denomination of choice, accounting for nearly half the bond volume a year
ago, but not even a third of its volume today.
Luxembourg franc-denominated bonds now represent 17 per cent of total bond
trading, followed by Canadian and US dollar bonds. And bonds have shrunk as
a fraction of total trading volume, from 75 per cent last December to some
66 per cent in June.
Meanwhile, stocks and shares, which accounted for 26 per cent of total
trading on the bourse in 1992, now constitute 33.7 per cent.
Luxembourg securities account for nearly 90 per cent of stock trading. Of
the exchange's 66 domestic shares and 202 foreign ones, the top 10 traded
shares so far this year are all Luxembourg companies.
Those include Arbed, the steelmaker, whose shares remained remarkably stable
despite the announcement of heavy losses, and Audiofina, the holding
company, whose shares rose to record heights. (Audiofina holds a controlling
stake in the Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion.)
Mr Israel's view is that domestic companies will remain the core business on
Europe's larger stock exchange, but that - at least in Luxembourg - the
drive for a European single market will 'bring more players into the
picture.'

FT  21 OCT 93 / Survey of Luxembourg (2): Recession is too strong a term -
Simon Gray follows the economic signposts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LUXEMBOURG politicians and businessmen say anxiously that the Grand Duchy is
teetering on the brink of recession. Indeed, every industry except the
financial and media sectors claims to be facing recession, if not a crisis.
But even if the pessimists are right, it does not look like the kind of
recession other countries would worry about very much.
According to the World Bank, Luxembourg had the world's second highest GDP
per head (after Switzerland) last year: Dollars 35,260.
The ministry of economic affairs estimates economic growth in 1992 at 2.8
per cent, and predicts rates of 1 per cent for this year and 1.6 per cent
for 1994. To be sure, this is a reduction from Luxembourg's 1987-91 average
of 5.1 per cent, but technically it is nothing like recession.
Nevertheless, it would be hard to persuade Arbed of the truth of that. The
Luxembourg-based steelmaker lost LFf3.3bn francs (Dollars 95m) in 1992 and
expects the deficit to widen to LFf5bn (nearly Dollars 160m) this year.
The workforce engaged in steel production in the Grand Duchy stood at 27,000
in the mid-1970s. It stands now 8,300 - and Arbed is planning to cut this to
6,000 by 1996.
Steel is only the most conspicuous sign of slowdown in the economy. After
nearly 10 years of success on the back of commercial property development,
the construction sector has run out of steam - even if the industry's own
forecast of 10,000 jobs at risk (out of some 21,000) looks like
scaremongering.
Overall, industrial production by volume (excluding construction and civil
engineering) fell by 0.6 per cent last year and slipped by a further 2.9 per
cent in the first quarter of 1993. Industry executives believe that, in
general, production is now stabilising, but there is no sign of an
improvement in prices.
Consumer spending in supermarkets and chain stores declined by 1.4 per cent
last year, although early figures indicate a resurgence in 1993. The number
of new cars registered in the Grand Duchy in the first four months of the
year fell by 25.2 per cent compared with the same period in 1992.
Even residential property prices, which roughly doubled between 1986 and
1992, seem to have hit a ceiling.
This year has seen a small but steady trickle of job cuts at companies such
as Du Font de Nemours, Villeroy &amp; Boch, the ceramics manufacturer, and
Electrolux. These have contributed to an unemployment figure of just under
3,400 at the end of August - a record low, although still barely two per
cent of the working population.
But this does not tell the whole story. At the same time that unemployment
has been rising, so has total employment - by 3,400 in the year to February.
The 'new' unemployed tend to be Luxembourg residents who were previously
working in industry; in many cases, older people whom the Employment
Administration tactfully describes as 'hard to place.' The the meantime,
ever more commuter employees from Belgium, France and Germany are coming
into the workforce.
Frontaliers, as they are known, have long played an important role in the
Luxembourg economy. But their numbers have shot up rapidly over the past few
years: from 28,600 in 1989 to 45,400 in February 1993, in parallel with the
growth of the financial sector.
Precise figures are hard to come by, but the best guess is that about half
of all jobs in Luxembourg are filled by foreigners, either commuters or
residents.
In the financial sector - where the Luxembourg Monetary Institute keeps
exact figures - the proportion of foreigners at the end of June this year
was 52.5 per cent.
The banking industry and its constellation of financial services companies
lead the other side of the Luxembourg economy - the side which has enjoyed
surging growth, even as other sectors were running into difficulties.
Last year the 213 banks based in the Grand Duchy (there are now 221)
collectively improved their profits by 18.5 per cent, on top of a 24.1 per
cent growth rate in 1991. Similar growth has occurred in the investment fund
industry: its aggregate net assets more than doubled, from LFf4,157bn to
LFf8,818bn, between December 1991 and June this year.
Industry is by no means united in gloom. Sommer Allibert has decided to
expand its new auto components factory near Clervaux; Goodyear is expanding
tyre production at Colmar-Berg; Circuit Foil, the copper foil manufacturer,
is investing LFf2,7bn (Dollars 78m) in its facility at Wiltz. And Arbed is
pressing ahead with a LFf12.5bn (Dollars 360m) investment programme,
including replacement of two blast furnaces with electric arc furnaces.
The commercial property market, where rampant over-supply sent prices
tumbling by more than 20 per cent between 1990 and the beginning of this
year, is also showing hesitant signs of recovery. A new business park near
Luxembourg airport struggled initially to find tenants but is now nearly
full. Work started in July on a LFf2.5bn office and hotel complex south of
the city. and the government's ambitious plans for development of the
Kirchberg plateau have been rescued by Hochtief, the German developer, which
has taken over a project dropped last year by Sweden's Skanska.
The brightest performer, however, has been the media industry, where the
Societe Europeenne des Satellites has consolidated the market dominance of
its Astra TV satellite system. The Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de
Telediffusion made record profits in 1992 as RTL-plus in Germany and RTL4 in
the Netherlands led their markets in terms of both audience share and
advertising revenue.
Overall, while Luxembourg's economic outlook is relatively bright, questions
remain.
Can inflation be kept under control? Since 1987, when prices actually
declined, inflation has risen to a steady 3.5 per cent, fuelled by a
government budget deficit and a salary indexation mechanism which trade
unions are reluctant to let go.
This index is part of what the Luxembourg Industry Federation (Fedil) and
other employers' groups see as an increasingly uncompetitive cost structure.
They would prefer lower social security charges on employers and more
flexibility in dealing with a workforce which, in general, is expensive to
hire and difficult to fire.
They are also concerned about the growing impact of environmental activists,
who did well in the municipal elections. Environmental protests recently
persuaded the Fulflex group to drop plans for a rubber factory in Kehlen -
and may derail a planned industrial waste dump near the affluent dormitory
town of Mamer.
Longer term, there is concern that a return to prosperity in neighbouring
areas of Belgium and France could cut off a source of manpower on which
Luxembourg is increasingly dependent.
The alternative would be more immigration - no easy political option in a
country where, already, about a third of the population is foreign.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Survey of Luxembourg (1): Mighty EC micro-state - Its
economic performance makes the Grand Duchy the only EC member state to
fulfil all five 'convergence criteria' required under the Maastricht treaty
to join a European monetary union. Threats to its EC status will be stoutly
resisted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the 35 years since the foundation of the European Community, Luxembourg
has earned a justified reputation as a mighty micro-state.
A mixture of Rutland and Ruritania, the Grand Duchy packs an economic punch
quite out of proportion with its size and population. It has exploited
deftly the opportunities offered by open borders, free trade and steady
progress toward deeper European integration.
Over the past 12 months, the EC has been shaken by a series of political,
economic and financial crises which have raised questions about its
identity, its future development, perhaps even the historic inevitability of
integration.
In the Roaring Eighties, when Europe's economy boomed, the Grand Duchy's
population of 400,000 benefited enormously from its geographical position
near the centre of a single European market of 340m people. But these are
hard times for the EC, and the slump in the economies of neighbouring
Germany and Belgium has left Luxembourg looking more exposed.
The extent of its vulnerability should not be exaggerated. In 1992,
Luxembourg's banking sector increased its profits by 18.5 per cent - on top
of a growth rate of 24.1 per cent in 1991. Unemployment remains at less than
2 per cent, compared to an EC average of between 10 and 15 per cent. This
summer, Luxembourg was the only member state in the EC which met all the
Maastricht treaty's economic convergence criteria - the targets set for
membership of a future European monetary union.
The most pressing concern centres on the economic downturn in Germany,
together with the currency crises which have swept through the Community
since Danish voters rejected the Maastricht treaty in June 1992.
The initial targets for international financial speculators were 'soft-core'
currencies such as the British pound and the Italian lira; but in the spring
and summer of 1993, the assault shifted to the 'hard-core' grouping
including the French franc, the Danish krone and the Belgian franc, which
remains linked in a 71-year-old currency association to the Luxembourg
franc.
The recent weakness of the Belgian franc has touched a raw nerve because it
evoked memories of the 1982 currency crisis in which the Brussels
authorities devalued their currency unilaterally, without consulting
Luxembourg.
Fearing a possible re-run, Luxembourg has sent messages to the Dehaene
coalition government in Belgium that it expects every effort to be made to
preserve the value of the currency through a tight link with the D-mark. At
the same time, internal studies have been drawn up, examining the impact of
a future devaluation and assessing the Schmerzensgrenzen - pain barriers -
beyond which Luxembourg might have to re-examine its currency association.
This would be a big step into the unknown. In the meantime, Mr Jacques
Santer, Luxembourg's long-serving prime minister, remains adamant that he
believes the currency association (which was renewed last year) will
continue: 'It is not the Luxembourg tradition unilaterally to denounce
treaties,' he said in a speech earlier this month.
Behind these worries about Belgium's economic strength and its political
cohesion lies a more general worry about Luxembourg's position in a
Community on the brink of a new phase of enlargement; it is supposed to take
in Finland, Norway, Austria and Sweden by January 1 1995.
One, perhaps even two of the candidates within this group may well fail in
their bid for admission. But Luxembourg still faces a dilution of power;
disconcerting for a founder member of the EC which has long enjoyed an
influence greater than its size.
Recent reports that France, Germany and the UK are toying with the idea of
cutting down the size of the European Commission to 10 members are
unsettling; so is the notion that an enlarged EC should adapt the system of
qualified majority voting, to defend the position of the bigger states.
One senior Luxembourg official says he was 'appalled'. He suggests that this
would spell not only the loss of Luxembourg's right to send its own
Commissioner to Brussels, but also an EC dominated by the bigger member
states, following the principle of 19th century balance of power politics.
'The efficiency of the EC is important, but you must not go back to the
Congress of Vienna,' he says.
For Luxembourg, preservation of the status quo touches on the question of
national identity. 'Luxembourg has always been very favourable toward
Europe,' says Mr Jim Cloos, chef du cabinet to Mr Rene Steichen,
Luxembourger commissioner in Brussels, responsible for agriculture. 'But we
are often afraid of being submerged or swamped.'
He adds: 'We are emotionally closer to France and economically linked to
Germany, but we are neither French, nor German, nor Belgian. We are
something in between.'
It is wrong to speak of an upsurge in nationalism; but, like neighbouring
Germany, Luxembourg has lost its uncritical attitude toward the EC.
Politicians such as Mr Fernand Rau have made mileage out of running against
the Maastricht treaty, singling out its concept of EC citizenship which
provides for the extension of voting rights for foreigners.
Mr Rau, 52, is the Ross Perot of Luxembourg politics. His campaign to curb
public spending and raise private pensions to the generous level of state
employees failed to take off in the recent local elections, where the Green
Party fared better; but he remains a threat to the establishment because he
has spotted the dangers of pursuing European integration beyond reasonable
limits.
In the post-second world war era, Luxembourg has brilliantly exploited EC
legislation to carve out a position as a leading European banking financial
centre, breaking its earlier dependence on the steel industry. For example,
when the European Commission issued its directive on European-wide
investment funds in 1988, Luxembourg's parliament responded with appropriate
legislation within four weeks. This nimble approach anticipated future EC
legislation, paving the way for the Grand Duchy to attract more than 1,000
investment funds.
On the other hand, the Community's drive to harmonise tax legislation -
notably the withholding tax - constitute a direct threat to Luxembourg's
status as a financial centre. Savings running into billions of francs would
switch to tax havens in Europe such as the Channel Islands or Monaco.
Similarly, Luxembourg has no intention of sacrificing its other chief
advantage in the financial sector: banking secrecy. Any change in either the
withholding tax or banking secrecy would amount to a significant blow to an
industry which itself accounts for between 10 and 12 per cent of the Grand
Duchy's gross domestic product.
Leading executives such as Mr Charles Ruppert, president of the Luxembourg
Banking Association, argue that the financial sector's strength has more to
do with intellectual agility and high-quality training than favourable tax
laws. He points to the successful expansion of Luxembourg's commercial
satellite and television sector as prime examples.
But Mr Ruppert cautions that new arrangements for enlargement and
integration should preserve member states' national assets such as banking
and finance, even at the expense of European-wide harmonisation. In this
respect, Luxembourg speaks for many of the bigger members of the EC,
including the UK.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Crisis meeting called as
Russian aluminium costs soar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN ALUMINIUM producers, shocked by rapidly rising costs, have called a
crisis meeting with government officials. Their energy costs jumped by 183
per cent on October 1 and last week transport costs went up by 150 per cent.
Mr Youri Shlaifshtein, deputy director responsible for foreign economic
relations at Bratsk, the world's biggest aluminium smelter, said those
increases had raised the cost of producing aluminium in Russia to western
levels.
Bratsk and another big Siberian smelter, Krasnoyarsk, have been resisting
the electricity price increase imposed by Moscow because Russia is under
pressure from the International Monetary Fund to lift energy prices to
international levels. Mr Shlaifshtein said the Siberian smelters accounted
for 86 per cent of the local power suppliers' business. 'We appreciate they
have to make a profit but we have to convince the power suppliers there is a
line they must not cross if smelters are not to close.'
He said that, until three years ago, Bratsk, which has the capacity to
produce about 840,000 tonnes of metal a year, had 'minimal' transport costs.
After de-regulation of the transport sector these costs were now a great
burden.
Representatives of all Russia's smelters will meet senior government
officials at Bratsk in mid-November.
The Anthony Bird Associates consultancy group estimated that in mid-1992 the
Commonwealth of Independent States' smelters were producing aluminium for
about USDollars 550 a tonne because of 'astonishingly low input prices'. Mr
Horst Peters, general manager, technology marketing at VAW, the German
aluminium group, estimated recently that the energy cost increase would push
Russian smelter costs up to Dollars 1,200 a tonne, well above recent London
Metal Exchange prices.
Meanwhile, Russia's foreign economic relations ministry is this week having
two series of meetings about the surge in CIS aluminium exports - widely
blamed for causing real prices to drop to their lowest-ever level.
A European Commission delegation, headed by Mr Jorn Keck, director of
bilateral trade negotiations, is seeking a voluntary restraint deal limiting
exports and an industrial co-operation accord to help restructure the CIS
industry. And yesterday the Russians started two-day talks with government
representatives from other aluminium producing countries, including
Australia, Canada, Norway and the US, as well as the EC.
Some US companies want their government to seek cuts of at least 500,000
tonnes in CIS annual production and say they are ready to make dumping
charges if no satisfactory solution to the CIS export problem is quickly
found.

FT  21 OCT 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Australian wool prices have continued to move steadily against the buyer,
with finer Merinos in particularly strong demand. Overall, price increases
are gradual, and the Australian Wool Corporation's market indicator reached
457 cents a kg. on October 20, which compared with 450 a week before. When
the selling season opened in July the indicator was 459 cents, and
subsequently declined to a low of 411. Clearances at auction remain very
good, business in wool using markets has been better, and forecasts of a
continuing gradual firmer tendency for wool are multiplying.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Venezuela volunteers to mediate
in banana exporters' dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PORT OF SPAIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VENEZUELA HAS volunteered to mediate in the simmering dispute between Latin
American and Caribbean banana producers over access to the European
Community market.
The offer was made by President Ramon Velaquez during a meeting in Port of
Spain, capital of Trinidad and Tobago, with the presidents of Colombia and
Mexico and the leaders of the Caribbean Community and Suriname.
It followed an attack at the conference on the Latin American producers by
Mr James Mitchell, the prime minister of St Vincent, who said that the
economies of the Windward Islands of the Caribbean and of other traditional
banana suppliers to Europe, were threatened by 'indiscriminate flooding of
the market by supplies from Latin America'.
'Should our economies be destroyed by this, then relations between Latin
America and the countries of the Windward Islands are quite likely to suffer
irreparable damage,' Mr Mitchell said.
The row between the Latin Americans and the EC's traditional suppliers in
the African, Caribbean and Pacific group is over the community's banana
import regime, implemented in July, which imposes a 2m tonnes-a-year quota
for Latin American fruit. Imports up to that level attract duty of Ecu100
(Pounds 78) a tonne while a duty of Ecu850 a tonne is applied to above-quota
imports.
The community's traditional suppliers in the ACP group have tariff-free
access for the remainder of the EC's needs of about 1.5m tonnes a year. The
ACP producers say many economies dependent on banana exports face damage
through reduced market access while the Latin Americans say they are more
efficient producers and should benefit from an open market for the fruit.
'Market intelligence since the introduction of the new regime is indicating
that the banana situation in Latin America is not turning out, for Latin
America, to be as negative as those countries have been asserting,' Mr
Mitchell said. 'The survival of the Windward Islands' economies depends on
banana exports. We produce less than 2 per cent of the bananas in the
Western Hemisphere and supply only 20 per cent of the European market.'
Mr Patrick Manning, prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago and chairman of
the summit meeting, said that the leaders of Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela
had understood the arguments of the Caribbean banana producers and others in
the ACP group.
'Venezuela has undertaken to co-ordinate discussions with the Latin American
producers, while St Lucia will do the same for the Caribbean producers,' Mr
Manning said. 'The plan is for a ministerial meeting with an agenda to
discuss the matter and find common ground.'

mine venture

MUSTO EXPLORATIONS, the Canadian-owned mining group, is in talks with 18
international mining companies on the development of a USDollars
450m-Dollars 500m project in western Argentina.
The company has a one year option to develop what it claims is a world-class
gold and copper deposit in the Andean foothills and is looking for partners
to share development costs.
It is close to completing an 18-month, Dollars 7m feasibility study of the
Bajo de la Alumbrera property for YMAD, a mining company owned by the local
provincial government of Catamarca. Musto intends to take up a one-year
option to develop the project in association with YMAD and international
investors.
If all goes well, the Catamarca mine would be the first major mining
investment in Argentina in decades. Argentina's xenophobic mining laws once
discouraged investment, but in June it introduced new legislation
eliminating investment barriers.
Musto says Bajo de la Alumbrera is 'one of the largest proven unexploited
porphyry copper/gold deposits in South America' and could produce 250m lb of
copper concentrate and 360,000 troy ounces of gold a year for 20 years.
Construction work would take two to three years before the mine could begin
production.
Among companies in talks with Musto are Cyprus, American Barrick Resources,
Placer Dome and RTZ. Musto is also negotiating financial packages with First
Boston and Chase Manhattan banks.
Progress is being held up, however, by negotiations in the Catamarca
legislature over the royalties it will levy on the mine.
The federal government says that 20 local and foreign mining companies are
operating nine mines in Argentina and are considering 64 possible new
projects in which they have already invested Dollars 103m. Officials say
that two of the largest projects should attract investments of Dollars 500m.
Brazil may cut its tin output by 10 per cent next year because of low prices
in the world market, but is in no hurry to join the Association of Tin
Producing Countries, which is co-ordinating producer efforts to reduce world
supply, Mr Samuel Hanan, president of Brazil's mining and construction
company Paranapanema, said yesterday, reports Reuter from Kuala Lumpur.
Mr Hanan, who was attending an ATPC meeting here, said Brazilian exports
could also fall by 10 per cent in 1994 from 18,500 tonnes in 1993, well
below an export limit of 24,000 agreed with the ATPC.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Argentina secures bigger share
of fishery resources
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN AND Argentina have reached a new agreement on sharing fish resources
in the South Atlantic and waters surrounding the Falkland islands after two
days of talks in Buenos Aires.
The one-year arrangement favours Argentina, which will increase its share of
a substantially extended fishing effort next year - raising its catch of the
prized illex squid by 70 per cent to 220,000 tonnes. The Falklands will
retain its present quota of 150,000 tonnes.
The agreement is to be signed in London early next month during an official
visit by Foreign Minister Guido di Tella, in which Argentina's claims to the
islands will inevitably feature prominently on the agenda.
The accord will increase pressure on the islands' financial revenues, which
depend heavily on the sale of fishing licences. The islands' government
forecasts a 35 per cent fall in licence revenue next year to between Pounds
15m and Pounds 15.5m.
Argentine negotiators say, however, that 'the islands could not delude
themselves that we would never develop our fishing industry. This agreement
allows them to plan ahead'.
Argentina is likely to continue increasing its share of the catch in future
years.
Britain had hoped to strike a long-term agreement with Argentina that would
protect the islands' revenues. But Argentina is tying such an agreement to
concessions by London over shared development of the islands' possible oil
reserves and the lifting of the UK's arms embargo, imposed during the 1982
Falklands conflict.

The GOLD reached a two-month high as fresh US investor fund buying piled
into the New York futures markets. In London it closed at Dollars 372 a troy
ounce, up Dollars 5 on the day. 'It is quite a strong move. The (investment)
funds are buying it fairly heavily,' one dealer said, adding there was no
physical demand. 'Dealers were buying to test the price at over Dollars
370,' he said. SILVER was also strong, ending 13 cents up at Dollars 4.51
1/2 an ounce, but Platinum lagged with a Dollars 1.85 rise to Dollars 375.10
an ounce. At the London Metal Exchange the three months TIN price rose to a
fresh 10-week high of Dollars 4,970 a tonne but found expected stiff
resistance near Dollars 5,000 and ended after hours trading at Dollars 4,950
a tonne, up Dollars 70 on balance. COPPER ended its decline with three
months metal gaining Dollars 12.75 to Dollars 1,645.25 a tonne in what
dealers described as a 'technical consolidation'. ZINC was unable to extend
initial upward momentum, with the rise attracting hedge selling, although an
undercurrent of support remained, based on continued talk of production
cuts. The three months price closed at Dollars 952.50 a tonne, up Dollars
11.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bratsk finds going tough in the
real world - A town that depends almost entirely on its outdated smelter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR YOURI Shlaifshtein is attempting to explain why Bratsk, the biggest
aluminium smelter in the world, is diversifying into the manufacture of
socks and panty-hose.
He acknowledges that some western industrialists might find it difficult to
comprehend but the 300,000 people who live in the town of Bratsk rely almost
entirely on the smelter for their livelihood. It provides 20,000 direct jobs
and 77 per cent of the town's income. The Dollars 2m of precious foreign
currency invested in the hosiery business provides badly-needed jobs, is
making products for which there is a ready demand and is profitable.
The Bratsk smelter, located in Siberia, uses out-dated Soderberg technology
and is a big polluter. The town authorities don't like the pollution but
need the smelter. A compromise resulted in Bratsk cutting output a little.
One of Mr Shlaifshtein's colleagues told Reuter this week that the smelter
was producing 750,000 tonnes of aluminium a year compared with its capacity
of 840,000 tonnes.
'Russians must often choose between suffering from environmental problems or
losing jobs and their ability to feed their families,' points out Mr
Shlaifshtein, who is the deputy director of Bratsk Aluminium Plant
responsible for foreign economic relations.
Bratsk plans more investment to cut pollution - he says Dollars 12m has been
spent so far and a similar outlay was made to improve the infrastructure
around the smelter. It was essential that this be done without interrupting
production of the metal that provides the cash to pay for it all.
Now the European Commission and the US aluminium industry is pressing for
all the smelters in the Commonwealth of Independent States to cut production
and exports. Talks are going on in Moscow this week in the hope that a
framework for an agreement can be reached. Mr Shlaifshtein suggests: 'If it
is assumed that Russia should make all the sacrifices the talks (with the
EC) won't succeed.'
He says he could supply the EC delegation with ten to 15 reasons why EC
smelters should close and adds with a knowing smile, 'but we do not have
such a strong lobby in the EC as the French'.
Russia's moves towards establishing a market economy are now causing its
aluminium industry severe problems. Since the begining of October
electricity prices have risen by 180 per cent and transport costs by 150 per
cent and Mr Shlaifshtein suggests that Russian aluminium production costs
are now level with those in the western industry (see story above).
Since demand in Bratsk's domestic market dried up (western analysts say at
least half of all the aluminium produced by the former Soviet Union went to
its military machine) the smelter has been exporting about 450,000 tonnes a
year. The EC decision to restrict imports of CIS aluminium until the end of
November had very little impact on the smelter, says Mr Shlaifshtein. But it
has raised protests in Irkutsk, the region in which the smelter is located.
Irkutsk was allocated 100,000 tonnes of duty free aluminium exports from the
two smelters in the region to barter for essentials such as food and
medicines. This metal had to be directed away from the EC and the essentials
were bought elsewhere in the world.
'EC manufacturers lost the opportunity to deliver products to Russia. We are
establishing links in Japan and the US that might not have been necessary
(without the import restrictions). We are bringing in food from China which
stopped buying our aluminium in 1990 but is now a customer again.'
Bratsk is attempting to stimulate new Russian demand for aluminium, but this
will take time. Mr Shlaifshtein says that two joint ventures have been
formed, one with a Japanese and one with a US partner (which he will not
identify), to set up factories to produce non-stick cookware. About Dollars
8.5m is being invested, most of the equipment has been delivered, and the
first factory should start up early next year. He says these ventures should
consume about 20,000 tonnes of aluminium a year. Other CIS aluminium
smelters are involved in similar projects.
Perhaps most important of all, Bratsk has been working on a scheme that
should give it easier access to investment capital while cutting the price
it pays for raw materials and raising the value of the aluminium it exports.
These are the aims of Rosal Trading, a joint venture with Trans-World
Metals, a London-based organisation that claims to be the biggest trader of
Russian aluminium.
Trans-World previously provided finance for raw materials to 'kick-start'
Bratsk's production when the smelter was dangerously close to running out
early last year. The London company is also involved in a joint venture with
the local authority which has provided facilities for Bratsk to import
alumina (aluminium oxide) and export aluminium in bulk at the port of Vanino
on the east coast of Siberia.
Smartly turned out in a western suit and chain-smoking Marlboros, Mr
Shlaifshtein sits in Rosal's sparsely-furnished new office in the
Trans-World headquarters and recalls that until three years ago Bratsk's aim
was to produce as much aluminium as possible. It received no foreign
currency for its effort, all that went to the state, and it had no contact
with consumers so the management had no idea that the metal being produced
was considered low-grade.
'One reason we formed this company was to share Trans-World's experience and
contacts abroad. Contacts with consumers will enable us to change production
to meet their requirements. It will cost us very little to make these
changes,' he says.
Also, Bratsk wants to break out of the barter system into which it was
forced by cash shortages. It has to import 50 per cent of its raw materials
and pay for them with aluminium. 'The best way is to buy raw materials at
the lowest possible price and sell aluminium at the highest possible price.
When you have to deliver metal to pay for raw materials you do not get the
best price.'
The link with Trans-World gives Bratsk access to western banks and trade
finance and, further down the road, investment finance - something not
readily available to a smelter in remote Siberia.
Bratsk is now 51 per cent owned by its employees. Another 10 per cent is
held by small shareholders in the Irkutsk region, leaving 39 per cent with
the state. According to Mr Shlaifshtein, the state's shares will be
auctioned off to the public next month.
Meanwhile, the EC is offering help to the CIS industry in the form of
technology and, possibly, finance, in exchange for production cuts. Mr
Shlaifshtein says: 'Our complex problems cannot be solved by others. We must
solve our problems ourselves - then we can ask for help from others'.
But there is one way the EC could help Russia. 'It is not possible to go to
bed in a centrally planned system and wake up in a market system and expect
everything to go smoothly. The EC could help us make this transition.'

FT  21 OCT 93 / Government Bonds: Rate-cut hopes kept alive as Bundesbank
eases repo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
THE small drop in the Bundesbank's rate for 14-day securities repurchase
agreements and a slowdown in German money supply growth kept rate-cut hopes
alive, lifting prices in the German bond market and most of its European
neighbours.
Initially, traders were disappointed by the three basis-point drop in the
repo rate to 6.67 per cent and the 7.0 per cent September M3 rate following
market talk of a repo easing of up to 10 basis points and M3 around 6 per
cent.
However, the Bundesbank's conciliatory tone on inflation and its liquidity
injection at the repo were seen to indicate more near-term easing.
'It reinforces our view that they want to steer the repo rate lower in the
next few weeks,' said Mr Craig Shute, bond market analyst with Bear Stearns.
However, most market participants did not expect the Bundesbank's Central
Bank Council to cut key rates today.
FRENCH bonds dipped on disappointment over the small German repo easing,
which was seen to give the Bank of France little room to cut rates at
today's repo. However, prices remained underpinned by Bunds' strength and
the December notional bond contract ended 0.18 point higher at 124.70.
UK gilts continued Tuesday's rally, lifted by the German repo drop and by UK
economic data which underpin hopes for non-inflationary growth.
The long gilt contract hit another high at 115 7/32 and closed at 115 3/16 ,
up  5/8 on the day.
The Bank of England announced the sale of Pounds 400m in tranches of
existing index-linked bonds for dealing from today: Pounds 150m of the 2 1/2
per cent stock due 2003 and Pounds 250m of 2 1/2 per cent stock due 2020.
DANISH bonds rose sharply on fresh easing hopes, with the 10-year benchmark
bond rising 0.60 point to 111.27. Its yield gap over bunds shrank to 54
basis points from 59 on Tuesday.
SPANISH bonds posted sharp gains as the currency's strength and the German
repo easing spurred hopes for further cuts in Spanish interest rates.
The Bonos contract in Madrid rose 0.58 point to 103.65.
AT its first government bond auction, Luxembourg sold LFr3.845bn of 6.5 per
cent bonds due October 2003.
The weighted average auction yield was 6.185 per cent.
JAPANESE government bonds hit six-year highs, spurred by heavy institutional
buying and the drop in the three-month certificate-of-deposit rate to a
record low of 2.40 per cent - some 10 basis points below overnight money
rates.
The December JGB futures contract rose 0.54 point to 113.74.
US Treasury prices were mixed in light trading volume yesterday following
the afternoon announcement of the Treasury note auct-ions.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/4 at 106,
yielding 5.819 per cent.
At the short end of the market, the two-year note was down  1/32 at 100 1/16
, to yield 3.823 per cent.
Longer-dated securities eased slightly at the opening in response to rising
gold prices, but quickly regained their losses and moved into positive
territory amid talk of further buying of Treasuries by municipal authorities
refinancing their bond issues at lower rates.
Otherwise, the focus of dealers and investors' attention was on the
afternoon unveiling of the next round of note auctions.
As expected, the Treasury announced it would sell Dollars 16.5bn of two-year
notes and Dollars 11bn of five-year notes next week.

FT  21 OCT 93 / International Bonds: Hectic trading in World Bank's first
D-Mark issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING in the World Bank's first D-Mark global bond offering got off to a
hectic start yesterday as latecomers scrambled to get a piece of the action.
The 10-year bonds were priced to yield six basis points over the 6 per cent
German government bond due 2003, at the low end of the indicated price range
of six to eight basis points.
As soon as the bonds were freed to trade, the spread rapidly narrowed to two
basis points as dealers tried to execute four or five large buy orders from
non-bank clients. However, the spread was expected to widen out as trading
settled down.
Syndicate managers said the launch of the DM3bn issue had been a success,
especially with international investors who regarded the bonds as a good way
to play the German bond market without having to buy German government
bonds.
They added that the liquidity of the issue was still untested. There was
some concern in the market that the bonds could become illiquid over time
because of the size of the deal and the good interest from retail investors.
Two large Eurobond offerings are expected to be launched over the next few
weeks from new issuers which intend to become frequent users of the Eurobond
market.
Urban Mortgage Bank of Sweden (UMB) plans to raise Dollars 500m through an
offering of five-year Eurobonds in the next few weeks. This will be UMB's
first fixed-rate offering in the Eurobond market.
The aim of the issue is to increase UMB's profile with international
investors so that it can diversify its funding base. UMB raises most of its
annual borrowing needs of SKr50bn in the domestic bond market. However, it
intends to raise 15 per cent to 20 per cent of this amount in the
international bond market in the future.
UMB has been encouraged to come to the Eurobond market by the improvement in
spreads on Nordic paper over the past few months. Spreads had widened during
the region's financial crisis late last year.
UMB officials, in London yesterday to talk to investors, declined to comment
on pricing. A spread of 60 basis points over US Treasuries has been rumoured
but some syndicate managers said a spread at that level would be too tight
for a borrower with a single-A rating and a low international profile. Lead
manager Nomura said the bonds would not be priced at a level where they
would not sell.
Instituto Nacional de Industria (Ini), the Spanish state industrial holding
company, awarded the mandate for its first Eurobond offering to Goldman
Sachs and Morgan Stanley as joint bookrunners. Ini's Dollars 500m issue is
likely to have a maturity of five or 10 years and be launched in the second
half of November.
Among yesterday's issues, GECC became the first issuer, apart from the Asian
Development Bank, to return to the dragon bond market with a Dollars 250m
offering of three-year bonds. The bonds were priced to yield 18 basis points
over underlying US Treasuries.

FT  21 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: KOP to spin off mergers
division
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KANSALLIS-Osake-Pankki, Finland's leading commercial bank, plans to transfer
most of its investment banking operations to a new associated company to be
half owned by management.
The company, Prospectus, will have a FM4m share capital and concentrate on
new issues, mergers and acquisitions, and corporate restructuring and
advice. It will have a staff of eight.
Capital market operations which require greater capital strength such as
underwriting, bond trading and equity positions, will remain within KOP.
Prospectus will be 50 per cent owned by KOP and 50 per cent by its executive
management and is scheduled to start business on January 1.
Mr Peter Fagernas, the company's managing director, said KOP was hoping to
broaden its customer base with a more arms-length investment banking unit.
Last year, Union Bank of Finland, KOP's main domestic competitor, spun off
its investment banking operations into a unit called Mandatum.
KOP's aim is to defend the bank's market position in new issues, where it
has traditionally had a market share of around 50 per cent, and build up its
position in corporate restructuring and advisory work.
This year its share of new issues has been a strong 70 per cent due to its
involvement in a number of internationally-directed issues for companies
such as Metsa-Serla and Repola.
KOP said it was ahead of its target to halve last year's FM3.7bn loss, as it
disclosed a lower deficit of FM777m for the first eight months. This
compares with a FM2.53bn loss in the same 1992 period.
Falling interest rates and reduced credit losses have improved the bank's
performance. Total income rose 58 per cent to FM3.35bn, while credit losses
fell 18 per cent to FM1.96bn from FM2.39bn. Non-performing loans at August
31 amounted to FM8.1bn, FM985m higher than at the end of 1992 but FM115m
down from the end of April.
Mr Pertti Voutilainen, KOP chief executive, said: 'The crisis is not yet
over but the worst seems to be past. We believe it will be possible to
return to profit in 1995, assuming the Finnish economy gains momentum as
expected.'

<TEXT>
KEMPER Financial Services, the Chicago-based money management group, has
agreed to pay Dollars 9.75m to shareholders in two of its mutual funds.
The move is to settle complaints that a Kemper portfolio manager deposited
winning futures and options trades into a profit-sharing fund that benefited
Kemper employees, and assigned unprofitable trades to the publicly-held
mutual funds.
Kemper Financial, which is part of the Kemper Corporation insurance and
financial services concern, has agreed to settle the complaints without
admitting or denying the allegations. Kemper Financial manages funds of
Dollars 72bn. At the time of the questionable trades, in 1987, it had
Dollars 45bn under management.
Mr Charles Kierscht, Kemper Financial chairman, said the company decided to
settle the case in order to resolve all outstanding issues in the matter
without the costs and distractions involved in litigation.
The settlement satisfies administrative complaints against the company by
the Securities Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, as well as parties to a class action lawsuit filed against the
company by shareholders in the two mutual funds.
The settlement will be paid into an account that will benefit mutual fund
investors.

3.9bn share offer

<TEXT>
MAANSHAN Iron and Steel has become the largest Chinese state company to
issue shares in Hong Kong, following the launch of its HKDollars 3.93bn
(USDollars 508m) share offer. Around 75 per cent of these shares have been
taken up through private placement, and analysts expect a strong response to
the public offer.
Maanshan is the fifth of the nine Chinese state companies short-listed for
flotation in Hong Kong, and it will be the largest. The company is forecast
to post net profit of Yn1.25bn (about HKDollars 1.08bn) in 1993,
representing a 207 per cent increase from 1992, as a result of lower
taxation and the benefits of the lifting of state controls on pricing.
The company is the eighth largest iron and steel company in China, and is
situated to the west of Shanghai. It has been rapidly expanding its
production capacity, in the face of the highest growth in demand among the
world's main iron consuming economies.
Given the vast requirement for infra-structural expansion in China, Chinese
steel demand is forecast to continue to outpace domestic supply. The company
is using the proceeds from the flotation to fund expansion of its iron
smelting facilities, and to boost steel rolling capacity. It also intends to
introduce new products, such as H-section steel bars, required for
construction of high-rise buildings.
The company is offering 1.73bn shares at HKDollars 2.27 a share.
Dealing in the share will commence on November 3.

20% quarterly surge

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MICROSOFT, the leading personal computer software company, reported a 20 per
cent increase in first-quarter revenues.
Net income for the quarter was in line with expectations at Dollars 239m or
79 cents a share, up from Dollars 209m or 70 cents in the same period last
year.
Revenues rose to Dollars 983m from Dollars 818m a year ago. Revenues from
software sold to computer manufacturers were particularly strong,
representing 26 per cent of the total, said Mr Mike Brown, Microsoft's
vice-president of finance and treasurer. For fiscal 1993, these OEM sales
represented 19 per cent of total revenues.
For the first quarter, sales of operating systems software accounted for 36
per cent of revenues, up from 32 per cent in the same period last year.
Applications programs sales were 59 per cent of revenues, down from 60 per
cent.
Microsoft said that changing software buying patterns have lifted sales of
its suite of office software products.
Whereas individual stand-alone applications products once generated the bulk
of applications unit sales, the Microsoft Office, combining word processing,
spreadsheet, presentation graphics, database management and electronic mail
is Microsoft's most popular applications product.
More than 2.5m units have shipped worldwide, the company said.
Earlier, Microsoft executives had warned analysts that the increase in sales
of suites of programs, together with the rise in OEM sales was expected to
slow revenue growth in the future.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 1993, Microsoft's revenues rose 27 per cent,
while net profits were up 20 per cent.
During the quarter, Microsoft began shipping its most-advanced operating
system product, Microsoft Windows NT.
Microsoft shares dropped in active after-hours trading to Dollars 79 1/2 , a
fall of Dollars 1 1/2 on its closing level.

FT  21 OCT 93 / International Company News: Bosses at Boral build a dynamic
image - Nikki Tait examines the Australian group's flurry of activity that
has pleased analysts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRUCE KEAN, the outgoing boss of Boral, could be said to be ending his days
in style.
By the time he leaves the Australian building materials group in January, Mr
Kean will have neatly executed a ADollars 830m (USDollars 552m) takeover
bid, overseen the Dollars 245m flotation of the group's manufacturing
interests, orchestrated management changes, and hopefully reported a
sustained resumption in profits growth.
He will then hand over the reins to a unexpectedly dynamic successor - Mr
Tony Berg, the former head of Australia's Macquarie Bank.
Given that this is Boral, long-regarded as a drearily mature corporate
earner whose broader strategy has often been found wanting, the flurry of
activity is something of a surprise. For analysts, it comes not a moment too
soon.
Mr Kean himself readily acknowledges that change had become imperative at
Boral. The company, he says, realised in the course of the recent recession
that construction industry cycles at home and abroad were becoming
synchronised. This meant that previous international diversification - into
the US, in particular - offered little protection against a slump in demand
in its core Australian market. 'The whole world went into recession - so
here we were, with a strategy to dampen the cycles, actually accentuating
the cycles.'
For the first time in its history, Boral experienced slumping earnings. Net
operating profits, ahead of extraordinary items, fell from ADollars 322.2m,
to ADollars 211.4m in 1991-1992 and then to ADollars 152m in the following
year. North America produced losses, while returns in Australia were
depressed. Mr Kean denies that the group ever felt subject to a takeover
threat, but a rethink was plainly required.
Boral's chosen path - the ADollars 830m takeover of Sagasco, the
Adelaide-based gas group - actually expands the company's involvement in an
area it has dabbled with for years. Boral's name is an acronym for Bitumen
Oil Refinery Australia Limited, and oil refining was its original
occupation.
'User-related' businesses - from brickworks to gasworks - were then added,
and the refinery itself was eventually sold. Funds were invested into the
building materials side instead, but energy remained a small part of the
group.
The reason for ploughing funds into the gas business now are twofold. The
first is the desire to stabilise earnings. 'We had to have something that
was stable, less cyclical than the construction business,' says Mr Kean.
Analysts add that the possible downturn for the housing market by 1995 may
have provided extra urgency.
Secondly, commercial prospects for Australia's gas industry - once heavily
regulated, costly and fragmented between the states - have improved
significantly as governments have pursued pro-competition, pro-privatisation
policies. 'Things have changed on the energy side,' comments Mr Kean.
'Governments have been privatising gas utilities, the shareholder
restrictions on gas utilities are being removed. The federal government has
been pushing for deregulation of the natural gas industry, looking for free
interstate movements.'
The most recent example of this occured a fortnight ago, when Queensland
agreed to supply gas to South Australia, and the latter then agreeing to
pass ethane on to ICI's petrochemical plant in Botany Bay. As a result of
this evolving process, growth in natural gas consumption in Australia is
forecast to outstrip significantly the growth in energy consumption
generally for the next decade.
By buying Sagasco, Boral obtains large production interests in SA's Cooper
Basin and elsewhere, in addition to the Adelaide-based gas company which
currently supplies about 292,000 domestic customers and 9,000 businesses.
The cost of the deal, meanwhile, will be partly offset by the flotation of
the manufacturing operations, detailed yesterday.
But matters will not end here. Boral is widely expected to acquire more gas
businesses down the road - probably in Victoria, where there has been talk
of privatising Gas and Fuel Corporation, or Western Australia. 'I see this
as the first of three chess moves,' says one BZW analyst. 'With Sagasco we
now have the critical mass to make the next, bigger bid in the energy
industry for Gas and Fuel Corporation or SECWA in Western Australia,'
confirms Mr Kean.
The domestic gas industry is not the extent of Boral's ambitions, either.
The aim, says Mr Kean, is to create a group with income derived equally from
Australian building materials, Australian energy, and building materials
interests overseas. The latter, in turn, would split evenly between North
America, Europe and Asia.
Boral has a way to go in meeting this objective. Sagasco means that energy
will account for about one-fifth of earnings, and future energy-related
purchases should lift this further.
But there is a recognised need to expand on the overseas building materials
front too - especially in Asia and Europe. 'In the mature markets, Europe
and North America, it will be by acquisition,' says Kean, mentioning that
the group is looking at an possible deal in the Czech Republic. In Asia,
operations are more likely to be grown by 'greenfield' investment. Current
plans include a gypsum board factory in Indonesia, and aluminium window
plants in Vietnam and Indonesia.
Achieving the three-fold split will be up to Mr Berg - who arrives at Boral
with a Harvard MBA, a background in investment banking, and a much-respected
record at Macquarie Bank. One analyst estimates that his appointment has
already added about ADollars 200-ADollars 300m to Boral's market
capitalisation. The stockmarket, at least, seems convinced that activity is
set to continue.

TELSTRA, the state-owned Australian national telecommunications operator,
reported pre-tax profits up 11 per cent on last year, despite the first full
year of open competition in the Australian telecoms market.
Telstra, one of Asia-Pacific's leading operators, reported profits up from
ADollars 2.12bn to ADollars 2.36bn (USDollars 1.57bn), before tax and
abnormal items, on revenue up from Dollars 12.2bn to Dollars 12.7bn.
The company is planning significant overseas investments, with a target of
increasing overseas revenue to ADollars 1.5bn a year over the next five
years.
Telstra has significant ventures in Vietnam, Cambodia, Pakistan and Saudi
Arabia. It recently bid unsuccessfully for the UK government's long-distance
network, and is considering a joint venture - with partners including Cable
&amp; Wireless - to extend the telephone network in the Philippines.

FT  21 OCT 93 / International Company News: Samsung agrees to cut stake in
Kia Motors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SAMSUNG group yesterday agreed to reduce its shareholding in Kia Motors,
ending its possible attempt to take over South Korea's second largest
vehicle manufacturer.
The decision by Samsung, one of the country's leading conglomerates, was
taken after Kia vowed to resist any takeover bid and state officials warned
that the government might intervene in support of Kia.
Samsung recently became Kia's second largest shareholder with a 9.6 per cent
interest after purchasing large blocks of stock on the Seoul bourse during
the summer.
Analysts believe that Samsung was setting the stage for a hostile takeover
attempt next year when government restrictions on mergers and acquisitions
will be eased.
The retreat by Samsung is considered a setback to its plans to become a
passenger car manufacturer. Samsung already owns Korea's leading electronics
company and operates in other industries ranging from shipbuilding to
construction.
'A takeover of Kia would have provided a shortcut for Samsung to fulfil its
ambition of entering the auto industry and becoming a major producer,' said
Mr Don Lee, a motor industry analyst for BZW in Seoul.
Analysts saw several advantages for Samsung in the deal. A takeover would
have meant that Samsung would immediately acquire production facilities
instead of spending several years and billions of dollars building them on
its own.
In addition, it would solve Samsung's apparent difficulty in finding a
foreign partner that could provide technology. Samsung is believed to have
held fruitless talks with BMW of Germany and several Japanese carmakers on
possible co-operation.
'The combination of Kia's production resources with Samsung's financial and
research strengths could have transformed Kia into a formidable competitor
against Hyundai,' Korea's leading car manufacturer, said Mr Lee.
Kia was considered vulnerable to a possible takeover since heavy investments
have put pressure on its finances and reduced earnings since 1990.
It reported net profits of Won15bn (Dollars 18.5m) in 1992 and won5.2bn for
the first half of 1993.

BORAL, the Australian building materials group, yesterday announced that it
expects to raise ADollars 245m (USDollars 163m) from the flotation of its
non-core manufacturing interests, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. These
interests range from the production of yarn and rope to tools and hardware.
Brand names include Gerrard springs, Kinnears ropes, and Trojan hardware.
The company plans to float 122.5m shares in Azon - the name of the holding
company for the diverse range of business - at ADollars 2 apiece. Boral will
then receive a further ADollars 55m through the repayment of inter-company
loans and a dividend from Azon - bringing the total benefit from the
flotation to about ADollars 300m.
News of the Azon flotation comes less than a week after Boral won control of
Sagasco, the Adelaide-based gas business.

FT  21 OCT 93 / International Company News: Maanshan Iron and Steel launches
HKDollars 3.93bn offer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MAANSHAN Iron and Steel has become the largest Chinese state company to
issue shares in Hong Kong, following the launch of its HKDollars 3.93bn
(USDollars 508m) share offer. Around 75 per cent of these shares have
already been taken up through private placement, and analysts expect a
strong response to the public offer.
Maanshan is the fifth of the nine Chinese state companies short-listed for
flotation in Hong Kong, and it will be the largest. The company is forecast
to post net profit of Yn1.25bn (around HKDollars 1.08bn) in 1993,
representing a 207 per cent increase from 1992, as a result of lower
taxation and the benefits of the lifting of state controls on pricing.
The company is the eighth largest iron and steel company in China, and is
situated to the west of Shanghai. It has been rapidly expanding its
production capacity, in the face of the highest growth in demand among the
world's main iron consuming economies.
Given the vast requirement for infra-structural expansion in China, Chinese
steel demand is forecast to continue to outpace domestic supply. The company
is using the proceeds from the flotation to fund expansion of its iron
smelting facilities, and to boost steel rolling capacity. It also intends to
introduce new products, such as H-section steel bars, required for
construction of high-rise buildings.
In the current year, China has seen a significant increase in the level of
steel imports, as it adapts to the removal of state controls on sales and
pricing, and there has been a recent fall in the price of steel. However,
Maanshan is considered one of the more efficient of China's giant industrial
corporations, and therefore capable of adapting profitably to the new
environment.
Analysts estimate that it has a USDollars 200 per ton cost advantage over
Asian competitors.
The company is offering 1.73bn shares at HKDollars 2.27 a share. Dealing in
the share will commence on November 3.

FT  21 OCT 93 / International Company News: Gengold mines' income improves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FIRMER gold price helped the 11 gold mines managed by Gengold, the gold
arm of the Gencor group, lift income after tax and capital expenditure by 22
per cent to R73.7m (Dollars 21.9m) from R60.6m in the September quarter.
The three mines not to improve on the previous quarter's performance were
Bracken and Stilfontein, both of which are being closed, and Unisel which,
as previously announced, is struggling temporarily with poor grades.
Mr Gary Maude, managing director, said a feature of the quarter was the
large increase in tax paid by some mines. Particularly hard hit were
Buffeslfontein and Kinross, which paid R16.5m (R2.4m) and R24.4m (R14.7m)
tax respectively.
Gold production in the group was virtually unchanged at 16,751kg. The
average gold price received rose by 10.5 per cent to R38,414 per kg and unit
working costs, across the group, rose by 1.1 per cent to R27,377 per kg from
R27,083 per kg.
In the Anglovaal group, the flagship producer Hartebeestfontein lifted
profits after tax and capital expenditure by 11 per cent to R49.4m in the
September quarter from R44.6m in June.
Higher costs saw distributable profits at the marginal Loraine mine almost
halved to R3.8m from R7.5m. ETC lifted distributable profits to R2.9m from
R2.7m.

WEAK international and domestic markets caused net income at Sappi, the
South African-based forest products group, to fall by 63 per cent to R64.3m
(Dollars 19.2m) in the six months to August from R175.1m a year ago.
Describing the results as 'very disappointing', Mr Eugene van As, chairman,
said nevertheless that they were 'in line with those of better performing
international forest product companies'.
Citing poor trading conditions and lack of promise in the short-term
outlook, the group decided to pass its interim dividend (80 cents a share in
1992). Earnings per share fell by 67 per cent to 43 cents from 130 cents.
Turnover rose by 36 per cent to R2.7bn as a result of the consolidation for
the first time of German subsidiary Hannover Papier, acquired in July 1992.
Turnover from existing businesses was flat, reflecting low selling prices
and difficult trading conditions. Operating income fell by 54 per cent to
R101m. Sappi Europe reached 'approximately a break-even result'.

<TEXT>
BURGER King, the fast-food restaurant chain, is reviewing its main US
advertising account, handled by the New York office of D'Arcy Masius Benton
&amp; Bowles since 1989.
The business, which according to industry estimates has a budget of Dollars
170m a year, is one of the world's most lucrative advertising accounts.
Burger King, a subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan, said it was 'seeking a
fresh approach' to a 'back-to-basics' marketing strategy, initiated by Mr
James Adamson when he was appointed chief executive last July.
DMB&amp;B's first television campaign for the group since Mr Adamson's
appointment was launched this month. It highlights prices and puts less
emphasis on quality.
The fresh approach by Burger King, which operates about 7,000 restaurants
worldwide, comes as packaged goods marketers are increasingly concerned over
the willingness of US consumers to buy lower-cost alternatives to brand-name
products.
Burger King said it would continue to stress value for money in its
advertising.
Burger King's advertising budget is Dollars 250m a year, which includes
international billings, special projects and advertising directed at
consumers from American US minority groups.

Sales were little changed at CDollars 1.4bn.

The strong US dollar restricted sales growth to less than 1 per cent in

after translation into the US currency rose only to Dollars 3.51bn, from
Dollars 3.48bn a year before.

AMERICAN Brands, the US tobacco and consumer goods group, yesterday emerged
as another victim of the cigarette price war as it reported a slump in
third-quarter net income to Dollars 85m from Dollars 202.7m in the same
period last year, writes Richard Tomkins.
Price cutting in the domestic market led its American Tobacco subsidiary to
turn in an operating loss of Dollars 35m for the quarter, including charges
of Dollars 60m for writedowns of stock values and restructuring.
Exchange rate movements on overseas earnings, particularly sterling, wiped
Dollars 52m off net income.
Third-quarter turnover fell to Dollars 3.3bn from Dollars 3.77bn, but the
company said the figure would have been 1 per cent higher without the impact
of exchange rate movements. Net income per share fell to 42 cents from 95
cents. Net income for the nine months to September was Dollars 282.4m,
against Dollars 650.5m.

DEAN Witter Discover posted a 52 per cent increase in third-quarter profits
to Dollars 171.6m yesterday following record contributions from its credit
services and Wall Street securities businesses, writes Patrick Harverson in
New York.
The strong third quarter took profits for the first nine months of 1993 to
Dollars 465.1m, already more than the Dollars 410.5m earned in all of last
year.
Mr Philip Purcell, chief executive, said the group continued to benefit from
a positive business environment, especially 'low interest rates and the flow
of assets into mutual funds'.
The securities business reported record earnings of Dollars 692.4m, up 25
per cent on a year earlier.
Brokerage commission revenues climbed 35 per cent to Dollars 226.3m, asset
management and administration fees rose 27 per cent to Dollars 217.1m, and
investment banking revenues grew 34 per cent to Dollars 90.2m.
Principal trading revenues, however, fell 5 per cent to Dollars 97.6m, due
to reduced activity in the fixed income markets. Operating expenses in the
securities business rose 20 per cent to Dollars 573.7m.
Dean Witter's credit services division, which includes its highly successful
Discover credit card business, produced earnings of Dollars 101.5m, against
Dollars 68.6m a year ago.

AMR Corporation, parent company of American Airlines, one of the biggest US
airlines, turned in a second consecutive quarter of profit yesterday. Net
income was Dollars 118m for the third quarter, compared with net losses of
Dollars 100m last time.
Mr Robert Crandall, chairman, said the profits were 'insufficient, but a
step in the right direction'.
'While we remain far short of our goals, we are pleased that our continuing
efforts to control costs and maximise revenue have begun to improve
results,' he said.
The company also took the opportunity to dismiss reports that it was seeking
an alliance with Sabena, the Belgian national carrier. American Airlines is
the only large US airline not to have secured a significant alliance with a
European partner.
American Airlines, like others in the US industry, has been dogged by tough
competition from lower-cost operators offering cheaper fares. Last month it
underlined its determination to bring its own cost structure into line by
announcing plans to eliminate 5,000 jobs and ground 11 of its DC-10
aircraft.
Mr Durham attributed the latest quarter's result to a 1 per cent reduction
in capacity, stable passenger traffic, and higher fares. The figures for the
comparable period, he pointed out, had been distorted by a fares war in
which American Airlines offered a 50 per cent reduction in fares.
Turnover in the third quarter was Dollars 4.2bn, a 13 per cent improvement
on the comparable period, and net income per share was Dollars 1.33 compared
with a loss of Dollars 1.32. Net earnings for the first nine months are
running at Dollars 143m , compared with a loss of Dollars 275m.
USAIR, the US airline in which British Airways has a 24.6 per cent stake,
produced the latest in a series of dismal results with a third-quarter loss
of Dollars 177.6m.

UNDERLYING earnings at BankAmerica remained flat in the third quarter as the
US's second biggest banking group continued to struggle against a weak
economy in its home state, California.
After paying out Dollars 26m in what it termed a 'special recognition award'
to employees following the merger with Security Pacific, net income in the
three months was Dollars 486m, or Dollars 1.19 a share.
This compared with after-tax earnings of Dollars 488m in the previous three
months and Dollars 476m, or Dollars 1.22 per share, in the third quarter of
1992.
'Economic weakness continued to constrain our overall business volume,' said
Mr Richard Rosen-berg, chairman and chief executive.
The bank continued to focus on controlling costs, he added.
Operating costs, at Dollars 1.85bn, were level with the previous three
months, though ahead of the Dollars 1.79bn of the 1992 third quarter.
Net interest income, at Dollars 1.88bn, was identical to the level in the
same period a year before, though up from Dollars 1.85bn in the second
quarter of this year.
Non-interest income, at Dollars 1bn, was down by Dollars 49m from the
previous quarter due to lower profits from asset sales and a decline in
foreign exchange trading income, from Dollars 108m to Dollars 76m.
Provisions for credit losses during the period fell to Dollars 175m, from
Dollars 200m in the previous three months.
In common with other US banks, BankAmerica reported a further rise in the
ratio of loan-loss reserves to non-performing loans, which now stands at 122
per cent, up from 110 per cent.
The bank's tier one capital ratio climbed to 7.2 per cent, from 6.9 per cent
at the end of June.

FT  21 OCT 93 / International Company News: Digital slides back into the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIGITAL Equipment, the troubled US computer manufacturer, slipped back into
the red in the first quarter of 1994 but cut its losses compared with the
same period last year.
The results were poorer than analysts had anticipated and the shares closed
down Dollars 1 at Dollars 35 1/8 in New York.
Digital suffered a net loss of Dollars 83.18m, or 62 cents a share, for the
quarter ended October 2, against Dollars 260.55m, or Dollars 2.04, a year
ago. The loss included a one-time benefit of Dollars 20m, or 14 cents,
relating to a change in accounting principles for taxes.
The loss before tax was reduced to Dollars 99.7m, compared with Dollars
250.5m last year, which Mr Robert Palmer, chief executive, attributed to a
focus on cost controls. Research and engineering spending has been cut by
Dollars 90m or 22 per cent and selling, general and administrative costs
fell by Dollars 259m or 23 per cent, compared with the same quarter a year
ago.
Operating revenues were Dollars 3.01bn, 9 per cent below the Dollars 3.3bn
recorded last year.
Mr Palmer said: 'We were disappointed by the revenue declines from last
year.' He attributed much of the fall to weak markets in Europe, especially
Germany and Italy. There was a slight decline in the US, but growth in Asia
was not enough to compensate for the falls in other areas.
Digital's latest loss comes immediately after its first quarterly profit in
two years and follows a campaign to convince customers the company is
committed to becoming a leader in 'client-server' systems. These are
networks of small computers, which are rapidly replacing the minicomputers
that have been Digital's main products.
Revenues and profit margins are suffering with the move to cheaper products.
Mr William Steul, chief financial officer, said Digital achieved
double-digit growth in both dollars and units in personal computers and
workstations, but product gross margins declined five points from last year.

FT  21 OCT 93 / International Company News: Lower oil prices restrict Texaco
to Dollars 317m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEAKER oil prices and special items restricted third-quarter net income on
continuing operations at Texaco to Dollars 317m, or Dollars 1.13 a share,
compared with Dollars 325m, or Dollars 1.26 a share, a year before.
Including the loss on the sale of the company's chemical business, net
income fell to Dollars 142m.
Before all one-off items, after-tax earnings were Dollars 255m, down from
Dollars 338m the previous year. Mr Alfred DeCrane, chairman and chief
executive, said this reflected a 'solid performance' in the face of a
Dollars 4 per barrel decline in crude oil prices.
Operating earnings from US exploration and production fell from Dollars 193m
to Dollars 138m while upstream activities overseas generated Dollars 15m,
down from Dollars 98m (both before special items), largely as a result of
lower oil prices.
Operating income from downstream businesses, on the other hand, rose to
Dollars 99m from Dollars 83m in the US and remained flat at Dollars 107m
overseas.
Texaco also reported special charges of Dollars 235m, stemming from staff
reductions, reserves to meet environmental clean-up costs and asset
write-downs.
These were offset by a Dollars 152m credit due to a change in tax law
affecting deferred taxes and a Dollars 145m deferred tax credit related to
the sale of an interest in a subsidiary.
A loss on the sale of Texaco's chemical operations led to a Dollars 164m
charge, along with a Dollars 11m loss for the quarter on the chemical
business.

movements for static quarter

<TEXT>
BRISTOL-MYERS Squibb, one of the world's biggest drugs companies, yesterday
reported a 3 per cent rise in third quarter net income on sales which slid 3
per cent.
For the three months to September 30, Bristol-Myers had net income of
Dollars 608m or Dollars 1.18 a share on sales of Dollars 2.86bn. A year
earlier, it earned Dollars 589.2m, or Dollars 1.14 on sales of Dollars
2.95bn, including earnings from discontinued operations of Dollars 17.4m.
Like its competitors, Bristol Myers has been hit by pressure to reduce drugs
prices. The company blamed unfavourable exchange rate fluctuations and
government costs containment measures in some European countries for its
sales shortfall in the quarter.
Mr Richard Gelb, chairman and chief executive, also blamed the decline on a
comparison with a very strong third quarter for pharmaceutical sales last
year.
In the latest quarter, Bristol Myers' pharmaceutical sales fell 4 per cent
in spite of higher sales for several new products including its
cholesterol-lowering Pravachol, its Videx AIDS medication and the Taxol
cancer-fighting drug. Sales of Capoten, a cardiovascular drug, continued to
erode.
Sales of medical devices were flat, while consumer product sales dropped 3
per cent, reflecting strong competition in the US analgesics and hair care
markets.
For the nine months, net earnings were Dollars 1.7bn, or Dollars 3.30, on
sales of Dollars 8.42bn. In the same period of 1992, the company earned
Dollars 1.38bn, or Dollars 2.67 including earnings from its Drackett
household products business which was sold in December and from a charge of
Dollars 246m for accounting changes.
Earnings from continuing operations rose 8 per cent to Dollars 1.7bn from
Dollars 1.58bn. Sales edged up to Dollars 8.42bn from Dollars 8.33bn.

<TEXT>
USAIR, the US airline in which British Airways has a 24.6 per cent stake,
yesterday produced the latest in a series of dismal results by reporting a
third-quarter loss of Dollars 177.6m. It was roughly in line with the
Dollars 180m loss it had predicted at the end of last month.
Part of the loss reflected an exceptional charge of Dollars 67.2m for costs
involved in cutting 2,500 jobs from its workforce, and the comparable figure
for last year's third quarter - a loss of Dollars 105.5m - included an
exceptional gain of Dollars 10.3m on the sale of its general aviation
activities.
Mr Seth Schofield, president and chief executive, acknowledged the figures
were poor. 'While revenues and yields have improved from last year, our
results are disappointing, especially in the light of more positive results
reported for the first two quarters of this year,' he said.
USAir, burdened with some of the highest wage costs in the industry, is
facing tough competition from low-cost carriers, such as Southwest Airlines,
which last month launched an assault on USAir's Baltimore hub in the
north-east. It has failed to report an annual profit since 1988.
The company hopes to cut its costs by Dollars 200m next year.

returns

<TEXT>
REEBOK International, the athletic footwear group, suffered a 14 per cent
drop in third-quarter profits, citing losses from the sale of two divisions
and a slowdown in the sneaker market, AP-DJ reports.
The US group earned Dollars 63.9m, or 74 cents a share, for the three-month
period, compared with Dollars 74.3m, or 80 cents, in the same period last
year.
This year's figure included after-tax losses of Dollars 7m stemming from the
recently-completed sales of its Boston Whaler and Ellesse subsidiaries.
Revenue for the quarter dropped to Dollars 808.5m from Dollars 863.2m in
last year.
Last year's sales figures included revenue from Boston Whaler and Ellesse.
But even excluding those numbers, sales would have fallen by 3.6 per cent
this year.
The decline was brought on largely by a drop in the Reebok footwear
business.
In the US market, the company said quarterly sales of Reebok footwear fell
by around 20 per cent, reflecting the sluggish economy and a change in
footwear styles away from sneakers as casual shoes.
For the first nine months of 1993, Reebok reported profits of Dollars
172.7m, or Dollars 1.94, down from Dollars 182.4m, or Dollars 1.96 a year
earlier. Nine-month sales were Dollars 2.29n, compared with Dollars 2.36bn.

It may also develop two projects in Peru.
Net profit for the quarter was USDollars 58.3m, or 21 cents a share, up from

<TEXT>
TENNECO, the diversified US industrial company, more than doubled
third-quarter operating earnings, helped by a sharp turnround at its farm
and construction equipment division and improvements in its natural gas
pipeline operations.
Income from continuing operations advanced to Dollars 116m, or 64 cents a
share, compared with Dollars 46m, or 28 cents, in the third quarter of 1992.
Revenues were little changed from last year, at Dollars 3.2bn.
Tenneco's heavy equipment manufacturing division, Case Corporation, reversed
last year's third-quarter loss of Dollars 68m to report a Dollars 10m profit
in this year's quarter. Sales fell to Dollars 841m, from Dollars 848m in
1992.
Case, which has undergone substantial restructuring in the past two years,
will increase output in the current three months for the first time in seven
quarters.
A 30 per cent production increase will put Case's production for all of 1993
at the same level as 1992.
Mr Mike Walsh, Tenneco's chairman, said that new pricing strategies,
aggressive inventory management and quality control would continue Case's
operating improvement into 1994.
Tenneco Gas earned Dollars 94m in the quarter, up from Dollars 58m last
year, while operating income at Tenneco's chemicals division, Albright &amp;
Wilson, rose to Dollars 20m, from Dollars 15m.
The natural gas division's results were aided by a favourable rate decision
that added Dollars 34m to operating income in the third quarter.
However, the automotive parts and packaging divisions showed only marginal
income improvements, while revenues and operating income declined at the
Newport News shipbuilding division.
For the nine months, Tenneco's operating income rose to Dollars 852m, from
Dollars 680m last time.
Income from continuing operations rose to Dollars 301m, or Dollars 1.75 a
share, from Dollars 131m, or 82 cents a share, last year.
The company said that efficiency improvements had added about Dollars 170m
to operating income since January, compared with Dollars 215m for all of
1992.

DEAN Witter Discover reported a 52 per cent increase in third-quarter
profits to Dollars 171.6m yesterday following record contributions from its
credit services and Wall Street securities businesses.
The strong third quarter took profits for the first nine months of 1993 to
Dollars 465.1m, already more than the Dollars 410.5m earned in all of last
year.
Mr Philip Purcell, chief executive, said the group continued to benefit from
a positive business environment, especially 'low interest rates and the flow
of assets into mutual funds'.
The securities business reported record earnings of Dollars 692.4m, up 25
per cent on a year earlier.
Brokerage commission revenues climbed 35 per cent to Dollars 226.3m, asset
management and administration fees rose 27 per cent to Dollars 217.1m, and
investment banking revenues grew 34 per cent to Dollars 90.2m.
Principal trading revenues, however, fell 5 per cent to Dollars 97.6m, due
to reduced activity in the fixed income markets. Operating expenses in the
securities business rose 20 per cent to Dollars 573.7m.
Dean Witter's credit services division, which includes its highly successful
Discover credit card business, produced earnings of Dollars 101.5m, against
Dollars 68.6m a year ago.
Revenues rose 23 per cent to Dollars 483.9m, while operating expenses
increased by only 15 per cent.
Fee income from Discover cardholders and merchants climbed 26 per cent to
Dollars 226.4m as transaction volume and a larger merchant base rose
noticeably.
Income from the division's Dollars 18.7bn of managed loans grew 21 per cent
due to favourable interest rates, high loan portfolio balances and an
improving credit environment.
Dean Witter's stock rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 40 7/8 on the New York
Stock Exchange in early trading yesterday.

FT  21 OCT 93 / International Company News: Burger King reviews US
advertising account

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BURGER King, the fast-food restaurant chain, is reviewing its main US
advertising account, handled by the New York office of D'Arcy Masius Benton
&amp; Bowles since 1989.
The business, which according to industry estimates has a budget of Dollars
170m a year, is one of the world's most lucrative advertising accounts.
Burger King, a subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan, said it was 'seeking a
fresh approach' to a 'back-to-basics' marketing strategy, initiated by Mr
James Adamson when he was appointed chief executive last July.
'It is simply the right time to review creative options and steer our
advertising in the direction that further builds on our brand equities,'
said Mr Sidney Feltenstein, executive vice-president for worldwide
marketing.
DMB&amp;B's first television campaign for the group since Mr Adamson's
appointment was launched this month. It highlights prices and puts less
emphasis on quality.
The fresh approach by Burger King, which operates about 7,000 restaurants
worldwide, comes as packaged goods marketers are increasingly concerned over
the willingness of US consumers to buy lower-cost alternatives to brand-name
products.
Burger King said it would continue to stress value for money in its
advertising. 'This is a simple, fun business,' a spokeswoman said. 'There's
no reason to make our message too complicated.'
Burger King's advertising budget is Dollars 250m a year, which includes
international billings, special projects and advertising directed at
consumers from US minority groups.
The company declined to comment on the specific size of the account under
review except to say it involved 'a good portion' of the total.
DMB&amp;B would continue to handle the international portion of the business and
would be invited to participate in the review, the company said.

FT  21 OCT 93 / International Company News: Ferruzzi creditors begin a
delicate game - Foreign banks are looking to avoid bankruptcy proceedings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN bank creditors of the collapsed Ferruzzi-Montedison empire have
begun a delicate poker game to recover what they can of the L4,128bn
(Dollars 2.6bn) considered to be at risk.
Talking tough, they declared last Thursday the restructuring plan for
Italy's second largest private group as 'unacceptable'. This is in direct
contrast to the Italians banks, which with L14,058bn at risk, have given a
majority endorsement. The foreign banks last weekend formed a working group
composed of Barclays, Citibank, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and UBS with
the aim of preparing counter-proposals.
The first task, they say, will be to assess the state of the companies, on
which they have had no consistent information since the debacle of Ferruzzi
debts and losses became known five months ago. They then want to be assured
of cashflow projections and administrators' plans for management. From
there, the tough bargaining will start.
The foreign banks must propose a compromise rescue formula for
Ferruzzi-Montedison acceptable to all parties concerned. If not, the
administrators will be obliged to initiate bankruptcy proceedings.
'No-one wants to get involved in bankruptcy proceedings in Italy if they can
possibly avoid it,' said one of the foreign bankers involved. 'The
proceedings would be hideously complex and lengthy, and we have all seen the
problems that have arisen, first with Federconsorzi and then Efim.'
The 107 foreign creditor banks are not the only ones to realise this. In a
letter to the foreign banks this week, Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank
which drew up the restructuring plan, raised the dangers of bankruptcy
proceedings if they continued to reject the proposals. Mediobanca and the
administrators of Ferruzzi-Montedison believe the core of the group's
agro-industrial, chemical and financial activities can be salvaged through
restructuring. They point to the healthy half-year net operating profit of
Montedison, the main industrial group, up from L398bn to L748bn.
Whatever the outcome, creditors could lose more than L4,00bn in all,
according to informal estimates circulating among bankers.
Matters have not been helped by the foreign banks' claims that they were
excluded from preparation of the Mediobanca plan. They are also wary after
the mishandling of foreign creditors in the 1991 collapse of Federconsorzi,
the agricultural services group, and the 1992 liquidation of Efim.
The Mediobanca plan is centred on four elements: a debt moratorium for 1993
costing creditors L1,800bn; a consolidation of Ferruzzi-Montedison debt over
10-12 years costing creditors a further L1,600bn; assets sales worth
L5,500bn; and capital increases totalling L5,400bn through debt conversion
and fresh subscriptions underwritten 80 per cent by the creditors. There
will also be a L800bn fund to assist small creditors.
The 21 Italian banks, accounting for 71 per cent of the credits at risk,
have backed this plan and agreed to waive interest for 1993. Of credits
totalling L25,000bn on May 31, L18,899bn is bank debt subject to the
moratorium and to consolidation. The Italian banks are more vulnerable, not
only in the size of their lendings but in the quality.
They have L8,238bn extended to Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), the quoted
financial holding controlled by the Ferruzzi family until the June collapse.
A further L5,820bn of credits are outstanding with Montedison, Ferfin's
quoted industrial group. Ferfin's assets are essentially its 38 per cent
stake in Montedison, a 51 per cent shareholding in Fondiaria, the insurance
company, and shares in diversified interests.
The foreign banks, on the other hand, have their main exposure, of L3,381bn,
to the operating companies, Montedison and its associates. Only L747bn is
extended to Ferfin, the financial holding. They also have L1,537bn of
credits unaffected by the moratorium or debt consolidation - L1,070bn to the
soundly-operating Eridania Beghin Say foodstuffs business, and L193bn to
Edison, the power generation company.
The distinct nature of the foreign and Italian banks' exposures, coupled
with the domestic banks' greater interest in preservation of the
Ferruzzi-Montedison's indentity, has created different priorities and
approaches.
The foreign banks claim the interests of the creditors are being put before
those of the Ferfin and Montedison shareholders. Ferfin's equity in
Montedison must be first 'extinguished or reduced consistent with creditors
rights', they told Mediobanca. The cancellation of interest in 1993 to
protect shareholders equity, they claimed, 'violates creditors' rights, is
inconsistent with accepted international restructuring principles, and is
completely unfeasible'.
Another point disputed by the banks is the extent of asset sales. Rather
than protect the nature of Ferruzzi-Montedison, they believe credit recovery
can be maximised through a larger sale of the good assets controlled by
Ferfin.
For instance, the plan envisages the Ferfin stake in Montedison to be cut to
30 per cent and its stake in Fondiaria, to 34 per cent.
The backing of the big Italian banks for the plan enabled Ferfin's and
Montedison's half-yearly accounts to be passed by their boards. Approval had
been delayed from September 30 to permit the administrator to include at
least the biggest Italian creditors' decision to forego interest in 1993.
The next formal step will be the special meetings of Ferfin and Montedison
convened for November 31 and December 1 to approve the first stage of their
respective capital increases. If the foreign banks continue to oppose the
plan, the meetings will have to be postponed, perhaps leading to bankruptcy
proceedings.

FT  21 OCT 93 / International Company News: Net halved at Thomson-CSF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THOMSON-CSF, the French state-controlled defence electronics group,
yesterday announced a halving in net profits for the first six months of the
year. It warned that full-year profits would be below those achieved in
1992.
The company blamed the decline in net profits, which fell to FFr455m
(Dollars 79.8m) from FFr848m in the first half of 1992, on its stake in
loss-making Credit Lyonnais, and on restructuring costs.
Its 22 per cent holding in the French bank represented a negative
contribution of FFr225m, while restructuring charges amounted to FFr110m.
Operating profits, however, remained fairly steady at FFr918m, compared with
FFr935m last time.
Sales fell by 5.6 per cent in the first half of the year, to FFr13.94bn. The
company said turnover for the full year was expected to decline by about 5
per cent. Operating income is forecast to remain stable for the year at
about FFr2.07bn.
The fall in net income for 1993 will depend on the contribution from its
financial affiliates, and upon the amount of restructuring charges, the
group said.
The decline in sales in the first half was the result of the ending of the
billing period for two large overseas contracts with the US and Saudi
Arabia. International sales fell by 11 per cent, while domestic turnover
showed a 2 per cent rise.
Thomson-CSF is on the list of 21 publicly-owned groups which the French
government wants to privatise.
Industry analysts in Paris, however, say the sale of the state's stake in
the group was complicated by the structure of Thomson. In particular, most
analysts believe it would be difficult to sell Thomson-TCE, the loss-making
consumer electronics group which, along with Thomson-CSF, comprises the
group.

FM112m
</HEADLINE>

   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
METSA-SERLA, one of Finland's leading forestry groups, swung to a FM112m
(Dollars 19.7m) profit in the first eight months from a FM169m loss in the
same 1992 period despite persistent overcapacity in many of its markets,
writes Christopher Brown-Humes.
The group is confident of 'a clear profit' for the full year, after 1992's
FM290m deficit, although market conditions are forecast to remain difficult.
Sales rose 7.2 per cent to FM5.34bn from FM5.03bn in the first eight months,
leading the group to predict full-year sales of more than FM8bn. Operating
profit was FM616m, or 11.4 per cent of net sales, compared with FM345m, or
6.9 per cent of sales, last time.

FT  21 OCT 93 / International Company News: Compaq income doubled as cost
controls pay off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPAQ Computer, which yesterday reported a sharp increase in profits, is
reaping the benefit of its continued emphasis on cost control and product
innovation.
The US group is the only large personal computer maker that is consistently
profitable and it could soon overtake Apple Computer as world number two
after International Business Machines.
Shares in the Houston-based manufacturer rose Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 64
7/8 before easing to 64 1/8 , on third-quarter profits which surpassed most
analysts' expectations.
It reported net income of Dollars 106.77m, for the quarter ended September
30, more than double the Dollars 49.37m recorded a year ago. Revenues were
up 64 per cent to Dollars 1.75bn, against Dollars 1.07bn.
It is the fifth quarter in a row that Compaq has reported record sales. The
results are all the more remarkable because the third quarter is
traditionally its weakest.
Earnings per share increased 105 per cent to Dollars 1.25, fully diluted,
compared with Dollars 0.61 a year ago.
Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer, chief executive and the principal architect of Compaq's
dramatic turnround 16 months ago, attributed the results to continued
product innovation, an emphasis on manufacturing efficiencies and effective
management of distribution.
Until the middle of 1992, the company's market share and profitability had
been threatened by a strategy of charging a premium price for quality and
distributing strictly through approved dealers.
Mr Pfeiffer sought ways of manufacturing quality products at lower prices
and looked for new avenues to market.
For the first nine months, revenues are running at Dollars 4.99bn, up 86 per
cent on last year, while net income is Dollars 311.4m, up 152 per cent,
equivalent to Dollars 3.68 a share, fully diluted.

FT  21 OCT 93 / International Company News: UAP upbeat as profits climb 15%
midway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JEAN Peyrelevade, chairman of Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP),
France's largest insurance group, said yesterday the company was on the road
to recovery. This was in spite of the depressed conditions which persisted
in some of its markets.
His forecast came as the company announced results for the first six months
of the year showing net profits of FFr599m (Dollars 103.6m), an increase of
15 per cent over the corresponding period in 1992. Mr Peyrelevade said the
group was on course for full-year profits of between FFr1.5bn and FFr2bn. In
1992, profits fell 70 per cent to FFr1.08bn.
The recovery in profits should improve the prospects of privatisation for
the group, which is one of the 21 publicly-owned companies scheduled for
sale. Industry analysts in Paris said it was likely UAP would be privatised
early next year.
UAP's privatisation hopes have also been boosted by the resolution earlier
this month of a long-running wrangle with Suez, the French industrial and
financial holding company. An agreement between the two groups gave UAP
control of Colonia, the German insurer.
The increase in first-half profits was achieved despite an increase in
losses at Banque Worms, the group's troubled banking subsidiary. Losses and
provisions at the bank represented a negative contribution to group results
of FFr615m compared with FFr221m in the same period in 1992.
UAP said the increased losses from its banking activities reflected the fact
that Banque Worms took most of its provisions for 1992 in the second half of
that year, while this year they will be concentrated in the first half.
Mr Jacques-Henri Gougenheim, chairman of Banque Worms, said the bank's
full-year loss for 1993 should be half the FFr1.65bn deficit recorded last
year.
UAP's insurance division and the finance and property division both recorded
a strong performance. The insurance activities raised profits from FFr739m
to FFr949m, while property and finance was up from FFr430m to FFr756m.
The group's insurance turnover rose 8.5 per cent to FFr71.2bn. Premiums in
life assurance increased 8.6 per cent to FFr34.9bn, while premiums in
accident insurance rose by a similar proportion, to FFr36.3bn.
Mr Peyrelevade said some markets remained depressed. He singled out the
property market and casualty insurance, where claims levels remain a
concern.
Profits from the group's overseas operations enjoyed a strong first half,
with the figure rising to FFr599m from FFr319m in the first six months of
1992. Overseas activities represented 57 per cent of the group's insurance
turnover during the period.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLVO, the Swedish industrial group, yesterday launched a public offer for
the outstanding shares in Branded Consumer Products (BCP), the company being
formed from the non-drug operations of Procordia.
The move was expected following the company's June agreement with the
Swedish government, which will split Procordia into its pharmaceutical and
consumer product businesses. It is not linked with the planned merger of the
group's car and truck operations with France's Renault.
The offer values BCP at SKr11.9bn (Dollars 1.5bn), or SKr47 per share,
excluding SKr2.5bn of debt. It is essentially a mopping-up exercise, as
Volvo will hold 85.5 per cent of BCP's votes and 73.7 per cent of its
capital once Procordia is formally split next month.
Volvo's offer consists of three alternatives:
One new Volvo share for every six BCP shares. Based on the SKr412 price at
which Volvo's shares closed yesterday, this values each BCP share at
SKr68.7;
SKr47 in cash for each BCP share;
Seven shares in the new Procordia, to be renamed Pharmacia, for every 20 BCP
shares.
Behind the offer is Volvo's desire to balance its cyclical motor vehicle
operations with a more stable consumer goods business. BCP comprises Swedish
Match, Procordia Food, Procordia Beverages and Procordia Invest.

FT  21 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Gartmore forecasts advance to Pounds 24.5m
 -Pathfinder for placing and public offer indicates market capitalisation of
Pounds 300m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GARTMORE, the investment fund manager owned by Banque Indosuez of France,
yesterday forecast a 64 per cent rise in pro-forma profits to Pounds 24.5m
before tax for the 1993 year in its pathfinder prospectus.
Banque Indosuez, which acquired Gartmore from British and Commonwealth, the
failed financial services group, in 1990 for about Pounds 130m, is to float
25 per cent of its wholly owned subsidiary next month.
Gartmore itself will not be issuing any new shares.
The shares to be sold will be divided between a placing, primarily with
institutions, and a public offer.
Gartmore is expected to have a market capitalisation of about Pounds 300m.
Mr Antoine Jeancourt-Galignani, Banque Indosuez chairman, yesterday
described Gartmore as 'an outstanding success' over the past three years.
He said a London listing would give Gartmore a higher profile both in the UK
and internationally, as well as providing opportunities for further growth.
Mr Paul Myners, executive chairman of Gartmore, said that its investment
record was an important and continuing asset. While Gartmore had grown to be
the fourth biggest investment fund manager in the UK pension fund sector, he
could see no restraints on further growth in market share.
Mr Myners believed the group, which employs just over 400 people, could
attack international markets using existing resources.
At the end of last year Gartmore had funds of Pounds 12.8bn under
management. This had grown to Pounds 16.1bn at the end of the first half and
Pounds 18bn at the end of September.
Pension funds accounted for 77 per cent of the business at end-June, with
unit trusts and offshore funds taking 7 per cent, investment trusts 5 per
cent, and others 11 per cent.
Pro-forma pre-tax profits were struck after non-recurring items, including
interest on a loan to Banque Indosuez, now repaid.
Mr Andrew Brown, finance director, said the company would come to the market
with no debt and no goodwill.
Pro forma earnings per share for 1993 were put at 8.1p, and the notional net
dividend at 4p.
The directors and some employees of Gartmore will be acquiring shares worth
some Pounds 8m at the offer price through the conversion of a share option
scheme put in place by Banque Indosuez, which has guaranteed not to sell any
further shares for 12 months.
Kleinwort Benson are sponsoring the flotation and Cazenove are brokers.

Profits of Berry Birch &amp; Noble, the USM-traded financial services group,
slipped from Pounds 518,571 to Pounds 460,104 pre-tax for the half year
ended July 31. Turnover advanced from Pounds 3.16m to Pounds 3.59m.
The shares fell 11p to 164p.
The directors blamed the setback on substantial investment to secure
continued expansion of the business, including development of the new office
in Clevedon, near Bristol.
They pointed out that without these costs there would have been a 'healthy
increase' in operating profits.
Interest income declined to Pounds 36,994 (Pounds 77,847). Earnings per

In the worst recession in the construction industry 'in living memory'
Whinney Mackay-Lewis, the USM-quoted architect and planner, saw pre-tax
losses for the year to April 30 double from Pounds 435,000 to Pounds
950,000.
Turnover fell from Pounds 5.68m to Pounds 3.45m.
However, the company said that the level of enquiries had risen rapidly in
the last two months and had reached a point where it was needing to take on
new staff.
Operating losses were Pounds 477,000, compared with profits of Pounds
205,000. Interest charges fell to Pounds 412,000 (Pounds 477,000) and there
was an exceptional charge of Pounds 61,000 (Pounds 163,000).
As part of the reduction in fixed costs it sold a property for Pounds 3.8m,
which allowed repayment of borrowings.
Losses per share were 12.1p (5.1p).

to 5.6p (7.2p).
The shares were unchanged at 2 3/4 p. Marlowe's cash offer is 2p per share.

FT  21 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Alexandra leaps to more than Pounds 2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALEXANDRA Workwear, the uniform supplier, announced pre-tax profits more
than doubled from Pounds 672,000 to Pounds 2.01m for the 28 weeks to August
14.
Earnings per share rose to 4p (1.3p). The directors declared an interim
dividend of 2.1p (1.8p) on the back of improving trading results and
continued reduction in borrowings.
Turnover rose to Pounds 31.9m (Pounds 30.9m) as the mix of business changed.
Mr Julian Budd, finance director, said: 'A year ago we were in a position of
undertaking strategic sales giving very low margins, but keeping the
factories going and allowing us to reduce stocks to levels commensurate with
activity.'
Stocks had now fallen and sales had increased on the back of higher turnover
in the core business - stockback service to small businesses that require a
24 or 48 hour delivery.
Towards the end of the first half Alexandra opened new shops in Hanley,
Northampton and Solihull as well as relocating an existing shop in Croydon.
Further sites are being considered, the company said.
'All areas of the group have contributed to the results, which have been
achieved through greater efficiency and a better sales mix despite their
being no fundamental improvement in trading conditions,' said Mr Gerald
Dennis, chairman.
He said there had been some signs of increased retail activity and the
company has resumed its retail investment programme: 'We look forward with
confidence to the second half of the year where so far all areas of the
group are maintaining their first-half performance.'
Borrowings fell to Pounds 7.59m (Pounds 13.5m) at the half-way stage and the
company anticipates further falls by the year-end. Interest charges declined
to Pounds 463,000 (Pounds 1.09m).
The company had Pounds 7.3m in bank loans and overdrafts as well as Pounds
289,000 in hire purchase contracts.
Gearing fell to 34 per cent compared with 46 per cent in the comparative
period.

FT  21 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Forward Technology losses double to Pounds
1.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EFFECTS OF rationalisation pushed losses at Forward Technology Industries up
from Pounds 539,000 to Pounds 1.23m pre-tax for the half-year to June 30.
Measures taken were related to the continental European recession, which had
affected French and German markets. Those markets account for 50 per cent of
group sales.
Mr Brian Chilver, chairman, said the company had taken extensive remedial
action to reduce costs and personnel and had charged Pounds 800,000 against
the opening half's results - the total exceptional costs anticipated for the
1993 year.
He pointed out that recession was slowing progress towards 'satisfactory
profits' and that this would be inevitably reflected in full-year results.
Group turnover for the half-year rose to Pounds 20.1m (Pounds 17.7m).
Electronics accounted for Pounds 16.1m, of which Pounds 2.1m (Pounds 13m)
related to currency changes.
Electronics returned profits of Pounds 223,000 (losses Pounds 53,000) but
sound and vision incurred losses of Pounds 58,000 (profits Pounds 132,000).
Losses per share widened from 1.6p to 3.6p.

FT  21 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Castle Communications rises to Pounds 1.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEAN MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REDUCED interest charges and the absence this time of exceptionals helped
lift profits at Castle Communications, the USM-quoted video and audio group,
by 11.6 per cent, from Pounds 1.36m to Pounds 1.51m pre-tax, over the year
to June 30.
Mr Terry Shand, chairman, said the results were mixed, with turnover up from
Pounds 31.6m to Pounds 33.4m, but operating profits down at Pounds 2.48m
(Pounds 2.76m).
In the UK, trading conditions for the audio division, which accounts for
more than 70 per cent of group turnover, remained difficult, Mr Shand said.
Video product sales fell as a consequence of Castle's concentration on
own-label requirements of the multiples rather than its general catalogue
sales.
However, Mr Shand said the group had substantially increased its investment
in video tangibles during the year by commissioning special interest
programming mainly for WH Smith's own-label requirements. Benefits from that
investment should come through in 1993-94, he added.
The pre-tax result was struck after net interest payable of Pounds 966,000
(Pounds 1.2m).
Earnings per share advanced to 15.1p (10.4p) and the proposed final dividend
is unchanged at 4.5p, which maintains the total at 8.5p.

FT  21 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Race on for new herpes drug - Paul Abrahams
considers the battle between Wellcome and SB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S barrage of clinical data from SmithKline Beecham and Wellcome
was only the first salvo in the struggle to succeed Zovirax, Wellcome's
best-selling herpes and shingles treatment.
The drug, the world's eighth top-selling medicine, is expected to generate
revenues this year of Pounds 745m, achieving a growth rate of 27 per cent.
Its growth, however, is set to slow. Zovirax's German patents expired this
year, while those in the UK and US run out in 1995 and 1997.
Those developing Zovirax successors include Wellcome itself, with Valtrex,
also known as valaciclovir; SmithKline Beecham with famciclovir; and
Bristol-Myers Squibb of the US and the Japanese group Nippon Shoji with
Usevir or BVaraU.
Zovirax has always been a tempting target but efforts to develop successors
have been held back by the toxicity of most anti-viral drugs.
This safety problem was highlighted last week when Nippon Shoji halted
Japanese supplies of BVaraU after only a month on the market.
Three patients taking the medicine had died because they were simultaneously
receiving fluorouracil, an anti-cancer agent.
The company closest to launching a competitor is SmithKline Beecham.
Famciclovir has been submitted to regulatory authorities around the world
and should be licensed for the treatment of shingles in the first half of
1994. A submission for genital herpes is likely to be made in the next few
months, with a possible launch at the end of next year.
The fiercest battleground between Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham could be
the market for post-herpetic neuralgia, the long-term pain that occurs in
about 30 per cent of shingles patients.
Although Zovirax is effective in treating the immediate pain associated with
shingles, its effectiveness in long-term neuralgia is not fully established.
Data presented yesterday by SmithKline Beecham suggested famciclovir was
effective in this area.
The marketing battle between the two companies for the immediate treatment
of shingles will be technical and hard. Lehman Brothers, the broker,
estimates worldwide sales of the Zovirax shingles application could be about
Dollars 500m (Pounds 330m) a year.
SmithKline Beecham sales representatives will be able to point to clinical
trials published last month that compared its drug with Zovirax against
shingles. The data showed famciclovir was no more effective than Zovirax,
but only needed to be taken three times a day. One of Zovirax's weaknesses
is that it needs to be taken five times a day.
Famciclovir will also have the benefit of SmithKline Beecham's huge
salesforce, which outnumbers that of Wellcome.
The company may also price aggressively. SmithKline Beecham's recent launch
of Paxil, its anti-depressant, was notable by this tactic. However, the
group's ability to undercut in the US may be limited, because Zovirax's
American price is already low.
Wellcome's sales teams will attempt to counter SmithKline Beecham by
pointing to Zovirax's safety record. It has been used by more than 30m
people over the last 15 years. In the clinical trials, famciclovir appeared
to generate a higher incidence of nausea and headache than Zovirax.
Meanwhile, the window of opportunity for SmithKline Beecham may be narrow.
Wellcome is rapidly developing its own successor compound. Data about the
drug was presented for the first time yesterday and showed it was more
effective than Zovirax for long-term pain associated with shingles. Another
trial for genital herpes showed Valtrex twice a day was as effective as
Zovirax five times a day.
Wellcome expects to submit Valtrex for approval to treat shingles during the
first half of next year. Since the compound is so similar in structure to
Zovirax, the drug should have few safety problems and could be licensed
quickly.
Lehman Brothers believes Valtrex could be launched in some markets by the
end of next year. Submissions to treat genital herpes are likely at the end
of 1994 or beginning of 1995. Such early launch dates would leave little
time for SmithKline Beecham to establish its drug.
Lehman Brothers estimates famciclovir will not capture more than 25 per cent
of the shingles market. Its share of the genital herpes market is unlikely
to exceed 15 per cent or about Dollars 75m. This means famciclovir annual
sales will be about Dollars 200m in 1996.
The additional marketing by the two companies could expand the market. A
recent study suggested only 28 per cent of shingles patients receive
anti-viral therapy.
Analysts reckon Zovirax sales could reach Dollars 1.5bn within three years,
while those for Valtrex could achieve Dollars 150m. On the basis of these
estimates, the herpes and shingles market could grow from Dollars 1.15bn
last year to Dollars 1.9bn by 1996.
The struggle between SmithKline Beecham and Wellcome could have two winners.

FT  21 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Havelock back in the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAVELOCK EUROPA, the storefitting company, returned to the black after two
years of losses with profits of Pounds 505,000 pre-tax in the first half of
1993, compared with a deficit of Pounds 1.6m.
The outcome was achieved on turnover of Pounds 12.6m (Pounds 16.1m), a fall
that the Fife-based company attributed to a deliberate policy of avoiding
low margin business, and to its practice of recording sales only when
contracts are completed.
Once again, no interim dividend is declared but a final of 1.5p is proposed
for the full year.
The company lost Pounds 2.4m in 1991 and Pounds 3m in 1992 and raised Pounds
2.97m via a placing and open offer last October. It also embarked on a
programme of reducing overheads, and has cut staff levels from 831 in 1991
to 583.
Mr Norman Lessels, chairman, said the latest result showed the company could
be profitable on lower turnover and said it represented the first stage in
its recovery.
Mr Lessels said the company had a heavy workload in the second half of the
year which, with sharply improved efficiency at the Nottingham factory,
should result in 'a very strong outcome for the year.'
Earnings per share were 1.9p (restated losses of 10p).

FT  21 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Aegis restructures to shift gravity base -
Law change prompts media group to run down French connection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AEGIS' centre of gravity has, until now, been France: the London-based
holding company of the Carat group could rely in the past on its French
business as its main source of revenue.
However, a change in the law in France on media buying, which took effect in
April, has radically changed the picture.
Yesterday's announcement of the proposed refinancing is an attempt by the
company to shift that centre of gravity. For the first time Omnicom, the
large US-based agency, will have a substantial interest in the company; at
the same time, Aegis will use Pounds 15m of its newly-raised money to
purchase the half of HMS, the profitable German media-buying company, that
it does not already own.
The new French law, known as the Loi Sapin, has meant that media buyers can
no longer bulk-buy advertising space at a hefty discount and sell it on to
advertisers at a profit, at the same time as taking commission payments from
television companies and publishers - a system that was not visible to
advertisers and resulted in very high margins for the French media buyers.
As Mr David Forster of Smith New Court, points out: 'The result has been
that margins in France have come rattling down.'
Media-buying revenues, overall, could be eroded by up to 40 per cent in
France - last year the country accounted for nearly Pounds 792m of Aegis's
Pounds 2.84bn turnover.
The development has called into question the entire group's capital
structure. 'The group's profit base and cash flow are now insufficient to
service the existing level of bank debt, meet deferred consideration
obligations and pay the fixed dividend and interest obligations on the
Europreference shares and the stock,' said Aegis yesterday.
The main features of the proposed refinancing will, in effect, mean Pounds
61.2m of new equity finance: Pounds 15m from Warburg Pincus, the US
investment institution; Pounds 15m from Omnicom; Pounds 15m from Electra;
and Pounds 16.2m from SFEC.
The restructuring will result in the conversion into ordinary shares of
Pounds 72m of Europreference shares, Pounds 25m of stock and Pounds 7m of 55
per cent preference shares. There will also be an exchange of warrants for
ordinary shares and cancellation for voting deferred shares.
Aegis said the refinancing would strengthen the group's finances by
increasing substantially its equity base, reducing fixed dividend and
interest obligations and removing about Pounds 30m of deferred liabilities.
'Payment of the dividend on the Europreference shares, due on December 13,
would significantly worsen the group's financial position and it is highly
unlikely that the group would be able to make such payment,' it said.
The board had tried to structure the refinancing so that each party,
including existing ordinary shareholders, would retain an interest, 'which
will allow them to participate on an equitable basis in the future growth of
the company'.
Mr Forster, however, was not convinced yesterday. 'It's not a very happy
situation,' he said. 'An awful lot of people have made an awful lot of money
out of the business over the years. The only people to have consistently
suffered are the ordinary shareholders.' From 170m shares in issue now,
there will be 934m shares after it has been fully diluted.
Ms Lorna Tilbian, at SG Warburg, agreed that the ordinary shareholders had
been 'diluted out of sight'.
While she was still concerned about the operation of the French part of the
company, she said that following yesterday's events the 'risk is very much
diminished'.
She is also watching Omnicom's long-term involvement: its 9 per cent stake
could rise to 13 per cent if it exercised its warrants and there is no
'standstill' agreement not to proceed further.

FT  21 OCT 93 / UK Company News: WH Smith may alter share structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WH SMITH, the retail and distribution group, is considering the introduction
of a single class of ordinary share.
Sir Simon Hornby, chairman, told the annual meeting that the board was
'aware of recent moves by companies with differential voting capital to
enfranchise such capital into one class of shares'.
Smith has 139m B shares, each with a nominal value of 10p and a single vote,
and 244m A shares, which have a nominal value of 50p and one vote. The
effect is that holders of the B shares have 36 per cent of the company
votes, but only 10 per cent of the equity.
This structure has been in place since the company was incorporated in 1949,
when it gave Smith family members effective control of the company.
The B shares would normally be expected to trade at a premium to reflect
their voting power. Smith B shares reached a 20 per cent premium in the mid
1980s, but in recent years have traded at a discount to the A shares. Some
observers suggest that the reason for this could be that no-one expected
enfranchisement to come under serious consideration.
Two-tier voting is increasingly being seen as anachronistic.
Other companies that had similar structures, including Great Universal
Stores and Austin Reed, have recently been enfranchising their shareholders.
On Tuesday Hammerson, the international property group, unveiled details of
its reforms, while earlier this month Whitbread announced plans to reform
its 45-year-old share structure to give equal rights to all shareholders.
Smith A shares closed yesterday at 479p, up 9p on the day. The B shares rose
6p to 98p, giving them a 2.3 per cent premium over the A shares.

FT  21 OCT 93 / UK Company News: St James's Place net assets improve 17.2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ST JAMES's Place Capital, Lord Rothschild's financial services group,
reported a 17.2 per cent rise in net assets per share in the six months to
September 30.
As announced in July, the company is distributing to shareholders its 37.4
per cent holding in RIT Capital Partners, the investment trust managed by J.
Rothschild Capital Management. In addition, St James's Place is distributing
Pounds 32.7m of cash; at September 30 values, shareholders should receive
48.7p per share in a combination of shares and cash.
St James's Place will be left with a range of financial services
subsidiaries plus a portfolio of investments. The financial services
subsidiaries are: J Rothschild Assurance (the life insurance group), Global
Asset Management and International Financial Markets Trading (fund
management groups), and J. Rothschild Wolfensohn (a boutique corporate
finance group).
However, these businesses make up only Pounds 38m of St James's Place's
Pounds 211m of assets. The remainder is invested in international bonds and
equities, with a particular emphasis on German zero coupon bonds.
Unrealised dealing gains of some Pounds 16.1m in the first half were a main
reason for the rise in net assets to 126.2p a share, against 107.7p at the
March 31 year-end. The directors announced last year that the company should
be judged on a net asset, rather than a profit and loss basis.
However, pre-tax profits doubled from Pounds 7m to Pounds 14.1m, helped by
the elimination of both investment dealing losses and start-up costs at J.
Rothschild Assurance. Earnings per share improved to 5.9p (3p) and the
interim dividend is maintained at 1.5p.
The company added: 'We continue to regard international equity markets with
caution in view of the fragility of the apparent economic recovery in the US
and the UK and the recessionary climate in Europe and Japan.'
RIT Capital Partners also announced its results yesterday, revealing that
net asset value had risen by 12 per cent to 202.9p a share over the six
months to September 30. Total net assets were Pounds 398m at the end of
September.
Since March 31 RIT has sold more than three quarters of its interest in
Newmont Mining, the gold mining group, realising about Pounds 114m. It has
invested part of the proceeds in gold call options, a similar strategy to
that followed by Sir James Goldsmith. As of September 30, RIT had a total
portfolio of Pounds 468m of which Pounds 230m was in quoted equities, Pounds
61m in bonds, Pounds 91m in specialist funds, Pounds 63m in unquoted
equities and Pounds 23m in property.

Lamont Holdings has acquired Cunningham Johnson for a maximum Pounds 5.92m
cash.
The price depends on net assets of Cunningham, at completion, exceeding or
falling below Pounds 1.82m as determined by accounts.
In addition Lamont has paid Pounds 960,000 to purchase, at face value, a
loan note obligation of Cunningham.
Established in 1986, Cunningham is primarily engaged in the commission
printing of furnishing fabrics and operates from two sites near Rochdale,
Lancashire.
The business is similar to that carried out by Alexander Drew, which was
acquired by Lamont in June 1992.

FT  21 OCT 93 / UK Company News: F Cooper jumps 27% thanks to productivity
and cost control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FREDERICK COOPER, the manufacturer of architectural hardware and specialist
coatings, announced a 27 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds
4.12m for the year to July 31.
The West Midlands-based group said the growth in profits, the first since
1989, was due to cost controls and improved productivity.
Mr Ed Kirk, chairman and chief executive, said the outcome - achieved on
turnover up from Pounds 82.8m to Pounds 84.3m - reflected the group's
success in winning a greater market share for its products rather than a
significant upturn in demand.
The growth in market share was achieved mainly overseas, where in the second
half exports rose by 12 per cent to Pounds 17.7m.
For the year, overseas sales accounted for 21.4 per cent (19 per cent) of
turnover, including Pounds 347,000 from Spectra, the US metal finishing
company acquired in June.
Although the Dollars 7m (Pounds 4.6m) cash acquisition had been expected to
increase gearing to about 60 per cent, Mr Kirk said improved profits and a
squeeze on margins had enabled the group to restrict year-end borrowing to
Pounds 6.8m (Pounds 6m) for gearing of 42.3 per cent.
Improved sales overseas were undermined, however, by flat demand in the UK
where turnover fell 1 per cent.
Profits from the architectural products division were also hit by a Pounds
150,000 loss on a contract for balustrading - an activity from which the
group now intends to withdraw.
Nevertheless, tight cost controls and a 2.5 per cent reduction in the
workforce meant the company was well placed to increase its market share
further, he added.
That cautious optimism enabled the group to recommend a final dividend of
1.5p (0.5p), bringing the total to 2.2p (2p), payable from earnings per
share ahead to 3.4p (1.8p) basic and 5.8p (4.8p) fully diluted.

FT  21 OCT 93 / UK Company News: UDO shows decline to Pounds 3.73m and looks
for acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UDO HOLDINGS, which supplies drawing office equipment and reprographic
services, saw pre-tax profits fall from Pounds 5.71m to Pounds 3.73m over
the year to July 31 on reduced sales of Pounds 48.5m, against Pounds 51.7m.
Earnings per share fell to 8.99p (13.66p); the recommended final dividend,
however, goes up to 5.13p giving a total of 7.2p (6.7p). 'The dividend
remains covered and the company has substantial cash balances,' said Mr
Graham Ede, finance director.
Mr Mike Wright, chairman, said the company had tried to offset declining
demand for diazo equipment - used to copy large format drawings using light
sensitive paper or film - by focusing on higher technology, higher margin
products as part of a continuing programme of measures, intended to counter
recession in its main markets.
Operating profits, including a small gain on the disposal of fixed assets,
reached Pounds 2.74m (Pounds 4.34m).
UDO generated Pounds 1.5m in cash, bringing cash balances to Pounds 14.8m
(Pounds 13.3m) at the year end, about 50 per cent of net assets, with which
it plans to hit the acquisition trail. Interest receivable came to Pounds
992,000 (Pounds 1.37m).
Mr Wright said: 'Although no acquisitions were made during the year the
group is actively looking at potential candidates in the UK and Europe.'

THE LONDON stock market's appetite for covered warrants was further whetted
yesterday when NatWest Securities issued a Pounds 100m warrant on Guinness,
the brewing group.
NatWest is the third stockbroker in the past two weeks to take the unusual
step of using warrants as a means of tempting investors into areas of the
market they might otherwise avoid.
A warrant gives investors the option to buy the underlying shares at any
time during the exercise period at the price on the day of the warrant's
purchase. The Guinness warrant, which can be exercised on a 2-for-1 basis
over the next 18 months, yesterday opened at 22 1/2 p.
The move comes at a time when Guinness shares have been under pressure.
There has been concern over the fortunes of LVMH, the French luxury goods
group which has a 24 per cent cross-holding in Guinness.
Dull global spirits trading has also dampened investor enthusiasm. Guinness
shares have slipped steadily from a 1992 high of 558p.
Yesterday, they closed 8p up at 413p.
NatWest said it believed the shares had reached a nadir, and the warrant was
an opportunity for investors to tap into the recovery potential of one of
the drinks sector's worst performing stocks.
Two weeks ago, BZW issued a Pounds 100m warrant for the food retail sector,
followed by SG Warburg last week on multi-media stocks.
Although warrants have the advantage of being tradeable, the market being
made by the issuer, their rarity owes much to the culture of UK fund
managers who complain that trustees are generally wary of using derivative
instruments.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Aegis to raise Pounds 61m in rescue move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AEGIS, the London-based holding company of Europe's largest media-buying and
planning group, yesterday announced details of a rescue package centring on
the issue of Pounds 61.2m new equity.
An open offer of 231m new shares, at 20p a share, will raise Pounds 46.2m,
with the rest coming from a preference share issue. Aegis's share price
plunged 11p to 21 1/2 p yesterday.
One of the underwriters is Omnicom, the US-based advertising giant, which is
expected to become a significant shareholder in the group, prompting
speculation that it could eventually combine its advertising activities with
Aegis' media-buying.
Aegis said yesterday that the refinancing was 'crucial to the future of the
group and in the best interests of all holders of Aegis securities.' The
group mainly operates through Carat, based in France, and has activities in
17 countries, employing 1,600.
Aegis also announced that it would exchange convertible securities and
warrants for ordinary shares, and cancel voting deferred shares. New banking
facilities have been arranged with Samuel Montagu, National Westminster and
Societe Generale. Aegis said its net debt has averaged Pounds 75m-Pounds 85m
this year, on a monthly basis.
The group, hit by changes in French law on media buying, reported pre-tax
losses in 1992 of Pounds 1.9m, while turnover increased 35 per cent to
Pounds 2.84bn. There was a move back into the black in the first half of
this year with pre-tax profits of Pounds 13.2m. The company has said no
dividends will be paid this year.
It also announced yesterday that it would purchase the remaining 50 per cent
of HMS, its German media-buying operation, for Pounds 15m.
The restructuring and provisions for bad debts in Spain and irrecoverable
assets in Holland would cost Pounds 14m in exceptional charges, it said.
The refinancing will take effect from November 22, providing the necessary
resolutions are passed at an extraordinary meeting on November 12.
Other underwriters of the ordinary share offer are SFEC and SCP Lagoon - in
settlement of deferred considerations - and Warburg, Pincus, the US
financial institution. The preference share issue is underwritten by
Electra.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Wellcome and SB open fire in herpes drug war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WELLCOME and SmithKline Beecham, the UK pharmaceuticals groups, yesterday
played their opening gambits in the battle for the world's rapidly growing
herpes and shingles treatment market.
The groups revealed data about successor drugs to Wellcome's best-selling
product Zovirax, which generated sales last year of Pounds 586m.
Wellcome published details of the first clinical trial on Valtrex, also
known as valaciclovir. The study showed the drug was more effective than
Zovirax in shortening long-term pain in shingles sufferers.
Valtrex also required less frequent dosing than its predecessor, according
to data which was presented at the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial
Agents and Chemotherapy in New Orleans.
Wellcome said Valtrex would be submitted to the regulatory authorities in
the spring, earlier than had been expected.
Meanwhile, SmithKline Beecham also presented data at the conference on its
drug famciclovir.
The study demonstrated it was more effective than Zovirax in reducing
long-term pain in shingles patients.
The studies presented yesterday could not be compared because each started
measuring the reduction in post-shingles pain at different time-points.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Smiths' shares lifted by medical growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMITHS Industries' shares gained more than 10 per cent yesterday after the
UK group reported better than expected results, confirming that growth in
its medical systems business was more than offsetting the decline in civil
and military aerospace.
Pre-tax profits for the year to July 31 rose to Pounds 104.6m, against
Pounds 102.2m. Sales, boosted Pounds 57m by acquisitions, increased from
Pounds 635m to Pounds 726m. The shares gained 39p to close at 394p, matching
this year's high.
Medical systems, which increased trading profits by more than 40 per cent to
Pounds 41.3m, for the first time contributed more to the group's annual
results than the aerospace division, which saw trading profits fall 8 per
cent to Pounds 40.5m.
The industrial division increased trading profits from Pounds 15.8m to
Pounds 21m, helped by an eight-month contribution from Vent-Axia, the fans
maker bought for Pounds 58m last December.
Mr Roger Hurn, chairman and chief executive, said the group had shed 1,000
aerospace jobs, evenly split between the UK and US, over the 12 months.
In the past three years the number of employees in aerospace has fallen by a
third, from 8,800 to 5,800, and now comprises little more than half the
total workforce of 11,200.
Mr Hurn said the downturn in the production of commercial jets and defence
cuts meant restructuring and job cuts would continue in aerospace. 'The
process must continue because the downturn has not yet bottomed out.'
The chairman believed there would eventually be a recovery in aerospace  -
particularly on the civil side, when a return to profitability by the US
domestic airlines would enable them to invest in bigger, more efficient and
quieter aircraft.
He said: 'I am confident there will be an upturn in the second half of the
1990s - my problem is knowing when it will start.'
The improved performance by medical systems was evenly split between organic
growth and the effect of acquisitions - in particular the Pounds 66m
purchase last October of Intertech Resources, a US disposable medical
products company.
The group's net cash balances fell to Pounds 34m from Pounds 120m last year,
following the purchases of Vent-Axia and Intertech. Operating cashflow
increased from Pounds 110m to Pounds 121m. Spending on research and
development reached a new peak of Pounds 118m (Pounds 115m), of which Smiths
funded Pounds 49m (Pounds 46m) and customers the rest.
Mr Hurn said: 'We have made significant acquisitions while generating an
excellent cash-flow from operations.
'Looking ahead, I am confident that our medical and industrial businesses
will continue to increase their contribution to profits.'
Although earnings rose by only 2.6 per cent to 23.9p (23.3p), a final
dividend of 7.55p (7.15p) gives a total for the year of 11.85p (11.25p), an
increase of 5.3 per cent.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Seeking high returns through high adventure: Sara Webb
explains why financial explorers are attracted by emerging markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jim Rogers is not your average tourist. When he rode his BMW motorbike
around the world with girlfriend Tabitha, he stopped off at nearly every
stock exchange en route to see what he could buy.
His holiday souvenirs included all seven stocks then listed on the Botswana
stock exchange.
Mr Rogers, formerly George Soros's business partner, is in one of the
fastest growing financial industries: emerging markets. He invests in the
debt and equities from far-flung regions.
'Emerging markets are to the 1990s what M&amp;A was to the 1980s,' says one
expert in the field.
Some - such as Thailand, South Korea and Mexico - have developed so fast
they have more-or-less graduated to developed status. Others, such as the
tiny stock exchanges of Morocco and Botswana, are of interest to the more
adventurous explorers of the investment world.
The high returns available from some of the emerging debt and equity markets
are proving a strong lure for institutional and retail funds.
Investors are pouring money into emerging market funds and new issues,
hoping to make money in the fast-growing economies of Asia and Latin
America. US closed-end mutual funds investing in emerging markets ranging
from Brazil to Taiwan have raised a gross total of Dollars 3.81bn through
new fund launches and rights offerings so far this year - up from Dollars
1.24bn in 1992, according to Lipper Analytical Services.
As further testimony to this surge in interest, investment banks have
stepped up their recruitment campaigns. Only recently, Morgen Grenfell
picked up almost the entire team of emerging market equities staff - sales,
trading and research - from James Capel, boosting their headcount from 100
to 120 and complementing their existing clout in the emerging market debt
business.
US firms such as Salomon Brothers and Morgan Stanley employ a couple of
hundred people in the emerging markets area worldwide, covering both
equities and debt.
'Firms like JP Morgan, Salomon Brothers and Morgan Grenfell dominate the
emerging markets debt business,' says one independent adviser, who adds that
the revenue generated from profitable debt dealing has in these cases
allowed expansion into the emerging market equity business, a smaller and
initially far less profitable area.
The interest in debt trading stems partly from the decision by countries
such as Nigeria, Morocco, Argentina and the Philippines to either reschedule
their debt or repackage it in the form of bonds.
In addition, retail and institutional investors can buy debt in eurobond
form from a variety of emerging markets including Mexico, Hungary and the
Philippines.
UK houses such as Baring Securities and Flemings have built up strong
reputations over several years, especially on the Asian equities side.
However, traditionally the US houses have had a competitive advantage in the
Latin American markets on their doorstep.
Invariably, expansion means head-hunting the nearest individuals or teams.
'There's a terrific shortage: people are lazy so they just look around and
see if they can steal talent from someone else,' says Mr Miles Morland, an
emerging markets consultant to several US fund managers, who chucked in City
life in 1989 to walk across France.
'Usually, what happens is that firms look at the existing pool of people and
redeploy them, so you see good people being sucked out of western Europe to
look at eastern Europe, or people in Hong Kong and Japan concentrating on
other parts of Asia.
'At the moment there's almost no one looking at Africa - I've heard of five
different Africa funds being proposed but no one can find anyone to manage
them.'
Mr Morland believes City firms are missing a great opportunity to hire well
educated local staff in some of the emerging countries they cover: not only
do they have the right contacts but they are also 'a lot cheaper' than most
new recruits in the City.
The people who do well in emerging markets 'tend to be a bit more creative
and imaginative than your routine spread-sheet jockeys,' says one insider.
'They are the kind of people who go on holiday to Siberia and check out the
local brewery for investment potential while they are there,' says another
specialist.
Mr Rogers, interviewed by phone while working out on his exercise bike in
New York, claims 'a motorbike is the best way to see a country'.
But his reception wasn't always the kind associated with the usual investors
roadshow. 'The people at the stock exchange were always a little surprised .
. . In Ecuador they thought I was some kind of drug smuggler.'
It is easy to see the appeal of these emerging market investments.
US interest rates are at their lowest level for 18 years; returns in the US
Treasury bond and stock market look lacklustre; and growth in much of Europe
has slowed down.
According to JP Morgan Securities, the Emerging Market Bond Index (EMBI)
rose 26.57 per cent in the nine months to September 30, outperforming both
US stocks and bonds.
Mr Stephen Dizard, a managing director at Salomon Brothers, points to the
increasing internationalisation of US investors, which has resulted in
greater interest in overseas investments - including emerging markets.
The aficionados - like Mr Rogers and Mr Morland - get their thrills from
being in a market where no foreigner has been before. 'Sri Lanka? That's a
bit overdeveloped for my taste,' laughs Mr Morland. Mr Rogers, meanwhile,
says he's putting his money into Ghana and Ecuador.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Dasa plans closures and staff cuts to return to the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEUTSCHE Aerospace (Dasa), the aircraft, defence and satellites division of
Daimler-Benz, is to shut six German sites, shed non-core activities and make
further heavy cuts in its workforce by the end of 1996.
The restructuring will save the loss-making company DM1.5bn (Pounds 611m) a
year, Mr Jurgen Schrempp, chairman, claimed yesterday. The aim was to return
to profit in 1995.
Turnover this year would be DM1.2bn lower than the DM16bn originally
envisaged, he said, and new orders would be DM3bn down.
Mr Schrempp, a dogged defender of the Eurofighter joint venture, has often
complained of lack of support from Bonn. A new report on the four-nation
warplane venture by the national audit office, due to reach the defence
ministry soon, criticises the project for poor management and excessive
costs.
'But the question remains whether and to what extent those people who have
an essential influence on the economic and political environment are
prepared to make their contribution to the continuance of the aerospace
industry in Germany,' he said.
Dasa's defence sales, which in 1991 accounted for 50 per cent of turnover,
generate only 27 per cent now. Federal spending on military hardware of
DM12bn a year in 1990, is scheduled to fall to DM6bn next year.
Two of the sites earmarked for closure are part of Dasa's Airbus commercial
airliner business, the other four are all defence-related. Company
executives said only 120 Airbuses would be built next year, compared with
original plans for 216.
Businesses scheduled for disposal are believed to include Dornier medical
technology, while Dasa is to attempt to bolster its guided missiles arm
through a joint venture with France. The company already has close links
with Aerospatiale.
News of the cuts immediately stirred protests, notably from the government
of Lower Saxony, where Dasa's Lemwerder aircraft maintenance site, employing
1,136, is to close.
Dasa workers' councils are also understood to be angry over alleged lack of
consultation.

FT  21 OCT 93 / BR sell-off plan suffers pensions blow in Lords: Treasury
move to cut financial obligations blocked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT PLANS to priv-atise British Rail suffered another embarrassing
reverse yesterday after it was defeated in the House of Lords over
safeguards for the industry's pension fund.
The defeat, along with a forced concession from the Department of Transport
to guarantee the future solvency of the pension fund and its obligations to
pensioners, blocked the Treasury's efforts to reduce its financial
obligations.
It also underlined the prospects of a damaging political row - and the risk
of further government defeats - when the privatisation legislation returns
to the House of Commons in 10 days.
Rebel Conservative MPs are threatening to back an earlier Lords' amendment
to the bill which would give BR the right to bid for the franchises under
which the network will be gradually privatised. That would undercut a
central element in the government's plans.
The signs last night were that the rebel MPs may also support the Lords over
pension fund safeguards if the government seeks to overturn the new
guarantees in a vote in the Commons.
The government's latest defeat centred on its plans to water down its
obligation to Trustees of the BR fund on the Treasury's contributions to the
pension.
The Lords passed an amendment tabled by Lord Peyton, a former Conservative
transport minister, which will reimpose an obligation on the government to
secure written agreement of the trustees before altering its financial
commitments.
Earlier Lord Caithness, the transport minister, had argued that the
amendment would effectively give the pension fund managers a veto over
government expenditure, insisting that the obligation should be only to
'consult' with the trustees.
But amid charges from the BR trustees that the government was seeking to
renege on the provisions of a memorandum of understanding it had signed in
July on the future of the fund, Lord Peyton's amendment was passed by 152 to
123 votes.
Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, was also forced to accept a
demand from the Lords that the provisions of the memorandum of understanding
should be incorporated into the privatisation legislation to guarantee the
future solvency of the fund and the rights of pensioners.
Opposition parties hailed the defeat as a step forward in ensuring the
rights of present and former BR employees.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Poll leads to cabinet reshuffle as Labour shifts to left
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, was last night preparing to reshuffle his
shadow cabinet after the party's annual election underlined a shift to the
left in the parliamentary Labour party.
In a poll that saw Ms Harriet Harman and Ms Ann Clwyd lose their positions
in Labour's 18-strong team, the top three places went to leading figures
from the party's centre-left.
Mr Gordon Brown and Mr Tony Blair, the party's foremost modernisers, both
dropped down the rankings having been first and second last year.
The two newcomers were Mr George Robertson, the long-serving Europe
spokesman who had an impressive year masterminding Labour tactics on
Maastricht, and Ms Joan Lestor, a former minister in Labour governments of
the late 1960s and 1970s.
In spite of a rule change designed to increase female representatives on the
shadow cabinet, the number of women elected fell from four to three.
Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, retained his place in the
shadow cabinet by a margin of just three votes, a result likely to fuel
speculation that Mr Smith may move him from a job in which he has rarely
looked at home.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary who topped last night's
poll, would be one possible replacement. But Mr Cook said last night he was
not 'looking for a change'.
Another winner was Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, who
increased his personal support by 26 votes and rose to third place. Mr
Prescott has been seen as one of those most likely to benefit from a
reshuffle. His speech at Labour's annual conference was widely held to have
swung the vote on selection reforms in Mr Smith's favour.
Candidates to succeed Ms Harman as shadow chief Treasury secretary include
Mr Robertson and Mr Chris Smith, shadow environment minister. Ms Marjorie
Mowlam has been tipped for shadow education secretary.
Senior party officials said Mr Smith was aiming to announce details of his
reshuffle today.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Retailers warn chancellor on taxes threat to recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, PETER NORMAN and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANY DIRECTORS and top retailers yesterday warned Mr Kenneth Clarke that
significant tax rises in next month's Budget could jeopardise the fragile
consumer recovery.
The chancellor heard the message in separate, private meetings with 20
retail chiefs and Mr Peter Morgan, director general of the Institute of
Directors, after news of a bigger than expected rise in retail sales volumes
last month. Mr Clarke was told that confidence in industry was low and that
many consumers remained wary of spending more.
Retail sales in September rose 0.5 per cent on August, a figure higher than
expected in the City. The Treasury said the result was 'consistent with
recovery'.
The news pushed up prices on the London stock exchange to a record closing
high, with the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares closing up 26.7 at 3,156.3.
But retail executives from large stores including J. Sainsbury, Tesco,
Kingfisher, Burton and Storehouse urged the chancellor at a lunch in a
London hotel organised by the British Retail Consortium to treat the latest
statistics with caution.
They told Mr Clarke that a further rise in VAT in the November 30 Budget
could lead to a dangerous fall in consumer confidence. They said much of the
recent increase in sales had been won only at the expense of much reduced
profit margins.
Mr Morgan told the chancellor he understood the Treasury's interest in a
fiscal tightening to bring down the Pounds 50bn borrowing requirement. But a
tax rise in the Budget, on top of the fiscal tightening of nearly Pounds 7bn
pencilled in for next April, would threaten the faltering recovery.
Mr Clarke's Budget deliberations were made no easier when the British
Chambers of Commerce said in its latest quarterly survey that the rate of
overall economic recovery slackened during the summer, largely because of
weak export markets.
Mr Christopher Stewart-Smith, the Chambers' president, said there were good
economic reasons for the chancellor to cut bank base rates by at least 1
percentage point from 6 per cent and give more help to exporters.
The chancellor also faced renewed protests from some Conservative MPs at
Westminster about the planned imposition of VAT on domestic fuel due to come
into force in the next financial year as part of the effort to cut the
Budget deficit.
Six Conservative MPs signed an all-party motion demanding greater
compensation for the elderly than planned by the government. The consensus
on Tory backbenches is that any move to end VAT zero rating for items such
as food and children's clothing would risk a full-scale revolt which could
easily overturn the government's 17-seat majority.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, urged Tory rebels to join Labour in
overturning the VAT extension during the Finance Bill following the Budget.

FT  21 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's insurance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It would be a relief if brinkmanship over the future of Lloyd's came to an
end with yesterday's vote in favour of the introduction of corporate
capital. The threat of litigation from disaffected Names still has to be
resolved. But that is not a mortal threat if a steady supply of corporate
capital can now be secured.
Still, agents acting for the proposed Lloyd's investment trusts might find
themselves diverted from the task of analysing and negotiating with
underwriting syndicates. Another round of legal action against market
professionals would do little for Lloyd's attempt to rebuild its image among
international investors. Both sides have an interest in reaching a
settlement.
Yet it is difficult to see where cash to meet claims for restitution might
come from. Providers of corporate capital are unwilling to foot the bill.
The proposal that Lloyd's should raise a loan to fund a settlement is
unlikely to win support, since interest payments would dilute underwriting
returns in future years. Reserves within Lloyd's itself are insufficient to
satisfy Names. With corporate capital in the bag, though, Lloyd's management
has the stronger hand.

FT  21 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Gartmore
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Banque Indosuez could hardly have chosen a more auspicious moment to offer
25 per cent of Gartmore. The heady level of world stock markets is inflating
the value of funds under management across the industry. For a pension fund
manager like Gartmore, that feeds through directly into higher fees. Due to
its enviable investment record, Gartmore is also winning new business hand
over fist. An especially good investment performance last year will keep the
three-year investment record in good shape, even if it now suffers a run of
bad luck.
Since Gartmore is only the fourth largest pension fund manager in the UK -
and less than one third the size of MAM measured by funds under management -
there is room for further growth without the costs associated with a big
push in unit trusts or an overseas acquisition. The Goode committee's
proposals on pension law reform were not onerous enough to cause a stampede
away from defined-benefit pension schemes, so demand for fund managers'
services looks secure. If Gartmore can keep its costs under control and
maintain a decent investment record, its earnings outlook is rosy.
The worry is that gearing to the level of equity markets cuts both ways. If
share prices started to trickle back, it would require a prodigious new
business effort to maintain funds under management and fee income. A stock
market shake-out would send the sector reeling. Not even a fund manager
which called the top for its clients would be immune from that.

FT  21 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Aegis
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The history of Aegis is that sadly familiar tale of a one-time media glamour
stock which made some people associated with it seriously wealthy without
doing much to enrich outside shareholders. Following its proposed
refinancing, existing shareholders will see their current 57 per cent
interest in the company diluted to 13 per cent. Preference shareholders,
too, are similarly disadvantaged. The directors chiefly responsible for
creating the tottering edifice by use of highly-rated paper and deferred
considerations have, of course, already departed with substantial pay-offs.
There is no question that Aegis was badly hit by French legislative changes
which have shredded the margins of Carat. This made it impossible for Aegis
to generate sufficient earnings to sustain its precarious capital structure.
With Pounds 180m of convertible shares and bank debt to service annually,
and some Pounds 55m of deferred payments to complete over the next few
years, the company desperately needed some form of refinancing. But Aegis's
attempts to make a virtue out of the fact that its shareholders will receive
better terms than those offered by WPP and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi at the time of
their restructurings is hardly comforting. It is rather like arguing it is
better to be crushed by a small avalanche than a big one.
Still, not everyone will do so badly out of the deal. Carat's vendors will
receive the bulk of the deferred consideration owed to them. But it is
Omnicom which could emerge as the ultimate beneficiary. Having helped to
underwrite the open offer, it will be perfectly positioned to acquire the
rest of Aegis in a few years time - just as the European advertising market
returns to health.

FT  21 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Goodwill towards Smiths
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Some engineering companies may bleat about poor markets, but Smiths
Industries has quietly focused on getting its costs in line with its
prospects. Nor has consistent performance been bought at the price of future
development. Smiths' research and development expenditure is at an all-time
high. Strong operational gearing means the company is well placed to profit
when the aerospace upturn finally arrives, while its lack of financial
gearing and growing medical business mean that the wait should not be too
painful.
Yet one aspect of accounting does place a potential constraint in the path
of the management's development programme. The high-tech medical businesses
it has acquired have justified the ratings paid for them, but the Pounds
416m goodwill write-offs of recent years have left the company with only
Pounds 267m of shareholders' funds on the balance sheet.
That is a poor reflection of the underlying strength of Smiths' business.
Worse, such accounting conventions serve companies poorly if managements
feel inhibited about justified expansion or shareholders misunderstand the
situation and the company's rating is damaged. Vested interests have thus
far resisted change in the conventions. Perhaps the Accounting Standards
Board should now recommend that goodwill is retained on company balance
sheets and steadily written off through the profit and loss account. That
would also form a useful discipline against overpaying for acquisitions.
Investors have had to put up with goodwill write offs and share issues
hiding the sins of poor companies. How much more serious if the rules start
to damage the prospects of good companies too.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Leading Article: A less easy partnership
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN REUNIFICATION took place in 1990 after extensive negotiations between
Bonn and its Nato and EC allies on the foreign policy implications of a
larger Germany. On the economic aspects of bringing together Germany's
disparate parts, for instance over the terms of the D-Mark's entry to the
east in July 1990, there was little or no consultation. This may have
appeared a plausible course at the time, but it now looks a miscalculation.
Bonn's policy errors during the past three years have increased the already
considerable economic problems of integrating east Germany, as well as the
length of time they will persist.
For Germany's EC partners, this has two sets of consequences. First,
unification-induced inflationary pressures, by forcing the Bundesbank to
maintain high short-term interest rates that were then transmitted abroad,
have contributed significantly to the European recession and to 1992-93
currency unrest.
Second, the need to finance large fiscal transfers to support east German
living standards has become a factor behind wider strains in Germany's
relationship with the rest of the EC. Because of the size of the east-west
German economic gap, these payments - currently equivalent to 5 per cent of
German gross domestic product - are likely to persist at least until the end
of the decade. The Community thus stands merely at the beginning of its task
of adjusting to the emergence of a Germany which has become bigger, poorer
and more polarised.
German scepticism
One particular difficulty centres on the scepticism of the German public
about the wisdom of exchanging the D-Mark for a single currency. Doubts are
growing whether Germany itself will be able to fulfil the stability-oriented
criteria designed to determine which countries could participate in economic
and monetary union. Mr Otmar Issing, a leading member of the Bundesbank
directorate, last week gave the first official warning that overall German
public sector debt could 'at least temporarily' breach the 60 per cent Emu
target laid down in the Maastricht treaty.
There must be longer-term doubts, too, about the sustainability of EC budget
policies that depend on German willingness to remain by far the main
contributor to Community funds. Germany's net payments to the EC last year -
Ecu9bn - were three times those of the next highest donor, Britain. Yet, as
a result of unification, Germany has slipped from second to seventh place in
EC members' GDP per head.
EC structural fund payments to east Germany, now one of the Community's
poorest regions, are expected at least to double next year to more than
Ecu2bn. More will probably have to be done to correct a growing belief in
German public opinion - most acute in east Germany - that Community
membership brings Germany more disadvantages than benefits.
Community compliance
Extra funds for east Germany are, however, unlikely to be forthcoming unless
Germany maintains high standards of compliance with Community legislation.
One disturbing signal at the end of last week was the Bonn government's
defiance of EC limits on land which can be sown with cereals in eastern
Germany.
In the past, German agriculture ministers have negotiated special
arrangements - consistent with Community law - to offset cuts in EC payments
to farmers with national subsidies. The attempt to put the special
predicament of east German farmers above the requirements of reforming the
Common Agricultural Policy is, however, a more serious matter. It undermines
attempts to persuade the Paris government to agree curbs in agriculture
support that are crucial for the talks on the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade.
Additionally, the spectacle of the Community's chief erstwhile proponent of
fiscal discipline inciting its farmers to break EC law may strengthen the
suspicion that, in its dealings with the Community, Bonn is practising a
form of double language.
A strong Community requires a self-confident Germany capable of setting the
EC agenda. To master its post-unity difficulties, Germany will need
solidarity from its partners. This solidarity may be found wanting unless
Germany lives up to its previous reputation for solidity and reliability.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Juggernaut veers out of fast lane: Japan's auto industry is
ill-prepared for such tough times
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese carmakers are on the rack and the screws are still being tightened.
After decades of virtually unbroken growth, vehicle production and sales in
Japan are falling for an unprecedented third year in succession.
While their US and European rivals are only too used to the cycles of feast
and famine in world auto markets, the Japanese companies are having to learn
to cope for the first time with a prolonged recession, and they are
ill-prepared. During the overheated years of the bubble economy at the end
of the 1980s, the Japanese over-indulged with an excess of new models and
features. Ironically, the masters of lean production have put on weight, and
they are learning that a forced diet is neither easy nor painless.
Tomorrow Japan officially opens the doors of the biennial Tokyo motor show.
Behind the scenes, the mood has changed significantly from the
self-confident celebrations of 1991 and 1989, when the formidable array of
new concept and production cars unveiled by Japanese producers threatened to
engulf rivals from the US and Europe, prompting one visitor to call the 1989
show 'Apocalypse, Wow]'.
Most of Japan's 11 vehicle makers are currently operating at a loss or, at
best, around break-even in their car and commercial vehicle operations, says
Mr Koji Endo, a leading automotive analyst at Lehman Brothers, the
investment bank, in Tokyo. The only producers that are still avoiding the
spreading stain of red ink are Mitsubishi Motors and Suzuki. Honda is spared
only by the strength of its motorcycle and parts businesses - its car
operations are also in loss, he says.
Even Toyota, by far the strongest Japanese carmaker, is expected to fall
into an operating loss for the first time in its history, in the six months
to December, although its strong financial earnings will probably protect it
from a net loss.
Japan, the apparently unstoppable juggernaut of the world auto industry, has
been forced off the road.
For three decades Japanese production rose, from fewer than 500,000 vehicles
in 1960 to 13.5m in 1990. The industry has survived previous world
recessions with barely a blip. If the protected domestic market weakened,
the heat was turned up in export markets.
But this time, Japanese vehicle makers are facing a challenge of a different
order. The length of the downturn in the domestic market is without equal.
The old remedy of exporting their way out of trouble is not available, with
many foreign markets also weak or deep in recession.
Their competitiveness abroad has been battered by a savage appreciation in
the value of the yen - of about 20 per cent against the US dollar this year
alone. The era of cheap finance raised on Japan's stock and bond markets in
the 1980s, which fuelled earlier growth, is past, but profit and loss
accounts are now sagging under the hangover of depreciation from
over-ambitious capital investments decided in the bubble economy years.
The industry is suffering from serious overcapacity and a growing surplus of
labour. It is staring at the unpalatable task of closing plants and shedding
jobs. 'The Japanese automotive industry will go through a very painful
period of restructuring,' says Mr Yoshikazu Kawana, an executive managing
director of Nissan, Japan's second largest carmaker and one of the world's
top five, which is now facing its second successive year of heavy losses.
'We have always lived in a time of growth,' he explains. 'Now we are having
to build a business structure without depending on an expansion in volume,
without depending on growth. This concept has not been thought of in the
past by Japanese industry.'
Japanese carmakers apparently can see no end to the current decline. 'For
the last three years market forecasters have been saying it would get better
in six months,' says Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto, chief executive of Honda. But new
car sales fell by 13 per cent in the past two years, and domestic
registrations dropped a further 5.8 per cent, year-on-year, in the first
nine months of 1993.
There is little help to be gained from foreign markets - apart from in
south-east Asia - in the face of the twin barriers of recession and trade
conflicts. Vehicle export volumes have been in steady decline since 1985 - a
trend that had been anticipated, as Japanese vehicle makers built up a firm
foreign production base, with output abroad jumping from 600,000 vehicles in
1986 to almost 1.9m in 1992. In the second half of the 1980s the drop in
exports was more than offset by the surge in domestic demand, but the
Japanese motor industry miscalculated. The home market was not expected to
go into free fall, and now the export safety valve is closed off.
Europe has seen new car sales fall 16 per cent in the first nine months this
year, and the European Community has forced a drastic cut in Japanese
shipments to the EC under the present system of 'voluntary' monitoring of
Japanese direct vehicle exports.
In North America demand may be emerging in fragile fashion from recession,
but unlike in previous decades there are no easy pickings. The US domestic
industry is rejuvenated. After a string of heavy losses, the big three
producers, Chrysler, Ford and General Motors, earned net profits of Dollars
2.3bn in the second quarter of this year alone.
The appreciation of the yen is forcing Japanese car producers to raise
prices much more rapidly than their US rivals, undermining their
competitiveness. They are losing market share - from 25.7 per cent of the US
car and light truck market in 1991 to 23.3 per cent in the first nine months
this year. Symbolically, at the end of 1992, the Ford Taurus displaced the
Honda Accord as best-selling car in the US.
The task of adjusting to the appreciation of the yen is not new, but the
industry has been taken by surprise at the rapidity of the rise this year.
Toyota calculates that its profits fall by close to Y10bn (Pounds 62.5m) for
every Y1 rise against the US dollar. 'The problem is not the level of the
yen appreciation but the speed,' says Mr Terukazu Inoue, Toyota managing
director for product planning.
Nissan faces one of the most serious restructuring challenges. It is
suffering heavy losses and high overcapacity in Japan, just as it is in the
process of moving further tranches of production abroad.
Mr Kawana of Nissan says, however, that all producers will have to take the
same actions sooner or later to reduce costs, lengthen model life cycles,
lower employment, and close some plants. Other steps would involve:
use of more common components in different model ranges. At Honda 60 per
cent (by value) of the components of one of its most recent new models, the
Domani, are taken from other existing ranges;
reducing the number of different model variants. At Nissan one model was
offered with 87 different varieties of steering wheel alone. It only needs
10, says Mr Kawana;
increasing co-operation between vehicle makers. Loss-making Isuzu has
abandoned making saloon cars. Instead, in Japan it will purchase cars from
Honda for sale under its own badge. In return Honda is buying four-wheel
drive leisure/utility vehicles from Isuzu for sale under the Honda badge.
Nissan and Mazda are swapping some light commercial vehicles.
Many of today's problems stem from the Japanese motor industry's original
belief in its own propaganda about its lean production and development
systems. 'We tried to meet too many customer needs, we started developing
too many models in too small volumes,' says Mr Kawana. 'Now we must
eliminate waste in the product development process and slim down.'
Nissan calculates that it has an overcapacity of 400,000-500,000 vehicles a
year in Japan. It announced that it would be forced to close one of its most
famous plants, Zama near Tokyo, in 1995. Closures were previously unheard
of. 'The auto industry had always enjoyed growth,' says Mr Kawana. 'To
realise the industry had come to such a turning point was a shock . . . That
was just the start.'
In three years from 1993 to 1995 Nissan is cutting its workforce in Japan by
5,000 to 48,000. Honda is also cutting 10 per cent of its assembly line
workers over five years; it has halved output on one assembly line; similar
action could follow on a second; and it is transferring surplus car workers
to its healthier motorcycle operations.
Companies are carrying surplus labour because of Japan's system - until now
 -of life-time employment. 'It is becoming an obstacle hindering the
slimming down (of the industry). This is becoming a crisis now,' says Mr
Kawana.
If the currency problems persist, Honda will have to shift more production
abroad in the long term, admits Mr Kawamoto of Honda, 'but we also have to
secure employment here. It is a sensitive matter . . . The situation is
still unpredictable, but we must prepare. In the longer term we have to
reduce production in Japan. We are losing our power to sell from Japan.'
Established management approaches are being overturned. The need to cut
costs has forced the setting of 'simple, clear, speedy targets', says Mr
Kawamoto. 'We are having to do this from the top down. It is very different
from the traditional bottom-up Japanese systems.'
Japanese carmakers are working feverishly towards meeting the targets they
have set themselves. Their rivals in America and Europe, which have suffered
the onslaught from Japan for so long, will gloat at their peril over Japan's
present woes. Japanese carmakers' underlying productivity has still not been
matched elsewhere, and the machine should emerge leaner and fitter from the
present trials. It is making the task of restructuring the European motor
industry even more awesome.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Trimmed to the bone: Carmakers' efforts to curb costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Teams of Toyota engineers have recently been visiting the company's
components suppliers in Japan more frequently than usual. Their visits are
part of a bold attempt to reduce manufacturing costs by at least Y100bn
(Pounds 625m) for the second year running.
The 'value analysis' initiative is being pursued energeticallyby Toyota and
its Japanese competitors: they are scrutinising the costs of car
manufacturing down to the smallest detail in the search for savings. A
similar exercise called 'value engineering' is also under way for new models
that are still in the design stage.
Companies are looking for savings over a short time scale. 'It normally
takes several years to cut costs by 20 per cent to meet the 20 per cent rise
in the yen, and we have to do that in a year,' says Mr Takashi Hamaguchi,
deputy general manager of purchasing at Nissan.
'Suggestions on how to reduce costs have been made by everyone. There was
even a suggestion to do away with the vanity mirror,' says Mr Goro Itoh,
general manager of the cost planning department at Toyota.
Other suggestions which have been adopted are already bringing savings:
By moving an electric wire harness that runs beneath the floor of one model
to the side and bending it slightly, Nissan was able to reduce the overall
size of the bracket that holds the harness down, thereby reducing costs by
Y20 for each car.
Toyota reduced the curve in the windscreen of its best-selling Corolla model
with a saving of Y600 a car. It also stopped covering the 'side members' -
holes at the bottom of the car body that are designed to reduce overall
weight - with rubber covers each costing Y4.
Such detailed examination of where cost cuts can be made has resulted in
Toyota introducing some 1,600 changes on the Japanese version of its Carina
family car. Many ideas have come from components suppliers, all of which
have been asked by Toyota to review their production costs.
'The main cost reductions will come from our suppliers, which make up 80 per
cent of our costs,' says Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto, Honda chief executive.
In an effort to contain the development costs of new models, Honda has been
talking to its components suppliers earlier in the design process. The
exercise has clearly paid off: Honda was able to cut the capital spending
needed for developing its recently launched new generation Honda Accord by
50 per cent compared with its original estimates.

Having toppled off a pair of Vivienne Westwood's shoes in Paris, British
supermodel Naomi Campbell was taking no chances with her platform appearance
at the British Fashion Awards on Tuesday night.
This time she strode on to the catwalk hand-in-hand with Brian Pitman, chief
executive of Lloyds Bank, which sponsors the awards. Pitman told envious
colleagues afterwards that Campbell grasped his hand to steady herself
backstage, and then kept hold.
And they say banking is dull.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Observer: Realms of gold
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'Were it not for gold and women, there would be no damnation.' Elizabethan
dramatist Cyril Tourneur might have had a point about gold.
Timothy Green, a former editor of the Illustrated London News, who this week
reissues his book, The World of Gold, reckons that a good many souls have
been lost in the cause of gold smuggling.
But smuggling is not what it was; once, at least half the world's gold
output ended up in smugglers' hands. But Green says they are now being
driven out of business by many important markets - such as India -
liberalising trade to the point where smuggling is becoming pointless.
The nostalgic, though, can still find smugglers who talk of 'a jacket' -
rather than ounces - of gold, a reference to a stout canvas jacket, with
pockets deep enough to fit 100 bars, or 375 ounces.
More practically, today's smuggler usually resorts to internal rather than
external concealment; the ideal 'biscuit', or bar, now requiring softly
curving corners.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The CBI's Andrew Sentance will now definitely be off by the end of the year
to join fellow UK Treasury economic adviser David Currie at the London
Business School. So the Treasury is hoping that Sentance will do the decent
thing and stand down from its panel of wise men - two people from the same
stable would make things a trifle unbalanced.
If Alan Budd, the Treasury's chief economic adviser, is stuck for
inspiration in his search for a replacement, he might care to consider the
distaff side of the profession. With economists from the consultancy world
unrepresented on the panel, Penelope Rowlatt of National Economic Research
Associates and Bridget Rosewell of Business Strategies should be on any
shortlist, as should Marion Bell of the Royal Bank of Scotland. The latter,
who spent two years recently on secondment to Great George Street, even has
some insight into how the whole shop works.
Ruth Lea of Mitsubishi Bank could be another candidate - though she might,
unjustly, be ruled out for being too argumentative.
Selecting a woman would certainly mesh with the Treasury's campaign to stop
the panel being referred to as the seven wise men.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Who said there's no such thing as a true corporate merger, only takeovers in
disguise? Two years after New York banks Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover
agreed a union of equals (even if the Manny Hanny name went), this week's
senior management reshuffle continues to reflect an unusual degree of
cosiness.
Walter Shipley, who headed Chemical before the merger, steps up from
president to become chairman and chief executive at the end of the year on
the retirement of John McGillicuddy (previous boss of Manufacturers
Hanover). Preserving the symmetry, the new president is former Manny Hanny
retail banking head, 52-year-old Edward Miller.
Miller was chosen over William Harrison, 50, a former Chemical man and now
head of corporate and institutional banking. But do not assume Miller
automatically becomes top dog one day. Shipley, who deems himself a 'young
57', warns that it is too early to talk of succession. Also, Harrison's
position in the triumvirate is deftly cemented by his inclusion in the
inner-most cabinet, known as the Office of the Chairman.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Observer: High-wire double act?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been a good week for North American executives who supposedly lost
out in the John Akers/Lou Gerstner succession at IBM. First John Sculley,
one of those tipped for the top at Big Blue earlier this year, jumped from
Apple Computer to Spectrum. Though others think it a loss-making minnow, he
claims not to have been so excited by anything in a decade.
Now Paul Stern, an ex-IBM man who seemingly made himself available for the
job at his former stable by resigning as chief executive of Northern Telecom
two days after Akers went, has pitched up at Forstmann Little &amp; Co. A
leading management buy-out specialist, the outfit seems to be in vogue with
high-wire telecoms types refocusing their careers.
Welcomed aboard as a special limited partner, he joins Daniel Akerson, 44,
who made it straight to general partner in August when he resigned as MCI's
president after less than a year on the job.
A 54-year-old Czech-born American, who has never denied an 'obsession' with
getting to the top, Stern left the Canadian telephone equipment supplier
miffed that his fellow directors had gone over his head in appointing Jean
Monty as president.
Akerson, meanwhile, maintained he had been lured by the opportunity to lead
General Instrument, controlled by Forstmann since 1989, into the world of
interactive media. Others reckoned that he had seen his path to the top
blocked by Bert Roberts, MCI's 51-year-old chief.
Let's hope Forstmann's Dollars 2bn war chest is big enough for both men to
make their mark without stepping on each other's toes.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Right lines for rail privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE parliamentary arguments over the privatisation of British Rail look set
to run until the very end of the legislative process. Not until the royal
assent has been given to the bill can the government be certain of the final
shape of its plans. Yet the broad outlines of the strategy for privatising
Britain's railways are now clear.
At the heart of the approach is the separation of the railway infrastructure
from the running of trains. A new company, Railtrack, will own the rail
network - track, signalling and most of the stations. Passenger trains will
be run by 25 operating companies, each paying charges for using the track.
BR's freight operations, to be divided into three companies and privatised,
will also pay for track use. A rail regulator will ensure free competition,
monitor safety arrangements and preserve network benefits such as through
ticketing and railcards.
This structure brings many benefits, including the creation of separate
businesses focused on particular functions. Railtrack, for example, can
concentrate on the rail infrastructure which has so often been neglected
under state ownership. BR's maintenance operations are to be privatised as
14 competing companies which will bid for contracts. Significant efficiency
savings on the infrastructure operation should follow, as elsewhere in the
public sector where contracting-out has been introduced.
Attractive investment
Sir Bob Horton, chairman of Railtrack, has already expressed a desire to
involve private finance in modernising the network. He is also keen to
escape from the public sector, with Treasury restrictions on borrowing
becoming ever tighter in the current fiscal climate. Like other regulated
utilities, such as the national grid, Railtrack is expected to prove an
attractive investment for the market. It should be a candidate for early
privatisation.
Passenger train operations will gradually be put out to tender, normally for
five- or seven-year franchises. Profitable franchises will go to the highest
bidder; unprofitable ones to the bidder requiring the lowest subsidy. Here,
too, competitive bidding should provide an incentive to reduce costs and
make the best use of Treasury subsidies.
If there is a criticism to be made about these plans, it is that they are
too timid. Rather than privatising BR, the government is contracting out the
management of its operations, and for relatively short periods. Most
operators will be reluctant to invest in new rolling stock, for example,
since its working life is much longer than the planned franchises. The
government has created three new leasing companies to own BR's rolling stock
and invest in new equipment. But the quickest way to bring new capital
investment in rolling stock would be franchises long enough for operators to
write off their investment.
Longer franchises
On balance, however, the gradualist approach is to be welcomed. By phasing
in franchising initially for shorter periods, experimentation can take
place. Once teething troubles have been dealt with, there is nothing in the
structure of BR privatisation to prevent longer franchises.
What would not be welcome is the demand of opponents of rail privatisation -
including some government backbenchers - to allow BR to compete for
franchises. This could lead to BR winning many - if not most - of the
franchises, cross-subsidising its bids to fend off competition. It would
also deter management buy-outs, since managers would be understandably
unwilling to compete with their own employer.
If BR is allowed to bid, it will not be the end of privatisation - vigorous
regulation could ensure that BR finds it hard to abuse its dominant market
position. And the structure is sufficiently robust to allow further
legislative change at a later stage when the fears of those who oppose
privatisation can be shown to be illusory. But with management teams already
planning their bids in the first round of franchises, it would be damaging
if the only group of people discouraged from bidding were the managers who
have the greatest experience in running the railways.
This is the second of two editorials on rail privatisation. The first
appeared on October 15

FT  21 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Corporate capital has adverse impact
on Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALAN J LEBOFF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In spite of my children and myself having lost a fortune at Lloyd's, we
ignored the pleas of a number of action groups and submitted our proxies in
favour of the chairman at yesterday's meeting (and therefore in support of
the introduction of corporate capital). We did so on the basis of the many
communications we have received assuring us that corporate capital is
essential for the health and future of Lloyd's and that it will in no way
adversely affect the interests of existing Names.
Yesterday morning, I received by post from my underwriting agents a fuller
explanation for the substantial, unexpected additional cash call they made
last week, saying: 'The cash calls . . .stem from the decision of Lloyd's to
discontinue cross lending by syndicates within the Lloyd's American Trust
Fund. . . in anticipation of the arrival of corporate capital in 1994.'
If asking me to pay yet more money now 'in anticipation of' corporate
capital in 1994 is not being 'affected adversely', what would be? You may be
sure that had Lloyd's made the choice plain, 'vote for corporate capital and
it will cost you', we would have voted against. How do we get it across to
those in power there is a limit to the money Names can find and that should
be their first priority, not the shape in which Lloyd's will enter the 21st
century?

FT  21 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Why regulation often fails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr P H TWYMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, No doubt inadvertently, the letter from Mrs Celia Hampton, editor of
Business Law Brief (October 16), neatly illustrates the irrelevance of many
regulations and the desirability of cutting red tape.
She says that many people are unaware of the risks of using the same knife
to cut raw and cooked meats and that the regulations aim to stop an outbreak
of food poisoning. However, if people are ignorant, no amount of regulation
will solve the problem.
A much better approach would be a public information campaign which would
probably render much of the excessive environmental health legislation
completely unnecessary.
Unfortunately, the automatic reaction of many people to a problem is to
devise a regulation which, it is hoped, will deal with the problem. Until
the government devises systems to overcome this automatic tendency, its
deregulation initiative is bound to fall short of its objectives.

spin-offs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr PETER DZWIG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I would like to agree with Professor Whitty's letter (October 20) and
point out that not only have the Alvey, Esprit, Race and other programmes
had valuable results, they have been of benefit to at least a part of the
FT's constituency: the financial community.
Many in the community are becoming aware of the implications for the markets
of parallel processing (much technology for which was generated through the
above programmes) and are investigating it. Indeed, almost three years ago
the FT carried a piece on the application of parallel computing in the
financial markets: a system installed at J P Morgan in London (Technology,
November 2 1990). The computer system underlying it was a commercially
available product derived from the Esprit programme.
Since the time of that article, parallel processing has developed somewhat,
not least with the entry of leading players such as ICL, Digital, IBM and
Tandem. The areas of application have also become more diverse, with a
growing number in general commerce.
This centre is an example of that. While it devotes a large part of its
effort towards the problems of the financial community, it is also working
in areas as various as planning and scheduling, marketing, management
information systems, architecture and engineering. These projects, which are
being carried out in close co-operation with industry, have practical,
business-oriented goals. Nonetheless, many may ultimately rely for their
technological underpinnings, whether hardware or software, on products
derived, directly or indirectly, from the results of the above programmes.

<TEXT>
THE UNMAKING OF IBM By Paul Carroll Crown Publishers Inc, 375 pages, Dollars
24
International Business Ma-chines has been crippled by arrogance, stupidity
and a 'grid-lock culture', writes Paul Carroll. The computer giant, long
revered as a model of American enterprise, has been brought to its knees by
managers so intent upon outmanoeuvring each other that they lost touch with
the realities of the marketplace, he maintains.
In Big Blues, the Unmaking of IBM, Carroll portrays IBM at its worst,
skimming over its achievements and emphasising its supposed mistakes. He
ridicules individual IBM executives and dismisses them collectively: IBM is,
he writes, 'like a music-publishing company run by deaf people'.
The book is so one-sided that, as one independent industry observer says:
'The reader is left with the impression that the only good IBMer is a dead
IBMer . . . the rest are either bad or ugly or stupid.'
Carroll's perspective has been shaped heavily by IBM's critics. He cites in
his acknowledgments 'senior people at Microsoft', IBM's rival in the
personal computer software market, as well as former IBM employees, many of
them embittered at losing their jobs. IBM refused to co-operate with
Carroll.
Thus, Big Blues provides, for example, accounts of meetings between Bill
Gates, Microsoft chairman and chief executive, and IBM executives. The IBM
executives are portrayed as clumsy, whereas Gates, seemingly, can do little
wrong.
Not that IBM does not deserve criticism. Even within the company, few would
now deny that its cumbersome management structure has hampered its ability
to adapt to changing market conditions. Unfortunately, however, the author
never properly explains the underlying causes of IBM's falling revenues,
losses and high debt charges.
The roots of IBM's problems lie in the developments in computer technology
that have slashed computer prices and lowered makers' margins.
The PC was initially a boon for IBM, boosting its revenues and profits to
record levels by the mid-1980s. However, as low-cost PCs began to account
for an increasingly large portion of most companies' spending on information
technology, growth in the more profitable mainframe sector - IBM's core
business - slowed.
PCs seldom directly replace mainframes, but by performing tasks that might
otherwise have required mainframe upgrades, they, in effect, limit growth in
the mainframe market, intensifying competition and putting pressure on
prices. The average price of an IBM mainframe has declined by more than 40
per cent over the past 12 months, according to industry observers. This,
more than any other factor, accounts for the company's decline in operating
earnings.
Carroll, however, concentrates on IBM's relatively lacklustre performance in
the PC market - and plays down the problems of adjusting to the decline in
mainframe profits. His theme is the 'rise and fall of the (IBM) PC and the
rise and fall of IBM that went along with it'.
IBM's biggest failing has been to 'squander its opportunities to turn the
PC, or anything else, into a business that would wax as mainframes waned',
he writes. If IBM had held on to a larger share of the PC market, its PC
operations could be more profitable, compensating for declining mainframe
profits, he implies.
This might have been achieved, Carroll asserts, if IBM had only had the
prescience not to allow Microsoft to license the DOS PC operating system
program to other PC makers. This mistake, he reckons, has cost IBM more than
Dollars 15bn a year in revenues by giving hundreds of companies an
opportunity to sell 'clones' of its PCs that can run the same software.
But the flaw in his argument is to assume that if Microsoft's MS-DOS had not
become an industry-wide software standard, IBM would have been able to
dominate the market and reap the rewards. Many would argue that the growth
of the PC sector is in large part due to the availability of thousands of
applications programs that can run on PCs from many different manufacturers.
Apple Computer, the one PC maker that has stuck with its own software - the
strategy that Carroll would have had IBM follow - trails IBM in terms of
market share.
Still, this argument provides Carroll with an excuse to devote much of his
book to describing how a 'bunch of kids' from Microsoft outwitted the
managers of Big Blue.
When the Microsoft-IBM relationship began in 1980, he points out, 'IBM had
340,000 employees, Dollars 27bn of assets, Dollars 26bn of sales and Dollars
3.6bn of profits, while Microsoft began the relationship with 32 people and
little else. IBM still found a way to lose.'
Only in brief reference to the feelings of former IBM president Jack
Kuehler, does Carroll allude to the possibility that Microsoft might owe
much of its success to its partnership with IBM. Gates and IBM finally
parted company last month when their agreement to work together on PC
software expired.
Neither is Carroll inclined to dwell on the fact that IBM's PC business is
now winning market share from its competitors. IBM PC unit sales are
estimated by industry observers to have risen by more than 30 per cent this
year.
Yet even if IBM were to triple its PC sales, the problem would remain: its
worldwide operations were built to make and sell computers that returned a
gross profit margin that is no longer attainable. To remain viable it must
cut jobs.
Big Blues throws light on the inner workings of one of the most complex
corporate institutions in the world. It also contains an important lesson
for all corporate managers: to remain focused on external competitors and
not allow internal politics to consume their energies.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Cynicism could obscure important
debate on internal controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL CHAMBERLAIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The unjustified cynicism of Mr George Lapsley and Mr G M Simon
(Letters, October 8 and 15 respectively) about the reasons underlying the
recent publication of draft guidance on internal control threatens to
obscure what promises to be an important debate in the Financial Times.
First, the working group on internal control is not 'the working party of
the institute'. It comprises individuals put forward by the 'hundred group
of finance directors' and the English and Scottish Institutes of Chartered
Accountants. Only two of its six members are in practice, the others are
directors.
The views expressed are those of the working group and do not, at this stage
of the consultation process, represent the considered views of any other
body.
Second, the working group was set up at the request of the Cadbury Committee
itself which had highlighted the importance of a framework of effective
accountability; the committee had also recognised that considerable work was
required not only to develop a set of criteria for assessing the
effectiveness of internal control systems, but also to provide guidance on
the form in which directors should report.
As noted in your Leader ('Tightening up internal control', October 5), such
matters produce a 'catnip' effect on accountants who have traditionally
found themselves made responsible for these matters.
Third, the draft offers guidance to the directors of listed companies and
does not seek to impose additional audit requirements.
Fourth, the draft is consultative. Comments received by the deadline of
February 28 1994, including we hope from Messrs Lapsley and Simon, will be
considered by the group and will be either incorporated or noted in its
final response to the Cadbury Committee.
It will be up to the Cadbury Committee to decide how the response should be
used.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Economic Viewpoint: How to cope with the slowdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some recessions are said to be 'home-made'. But if there is one sure feature
of the recent faltering in the British recovery, it is that it has been made
abroad. The key factors are the continued decline in the European economies,
which constitute Britain's principal export markets, and the slow and
hesitant nature of any recovery that may be taking place elsewhere in the
world.
No clever manipulation of domestic budgetary or monetary policy will allow
Britain to contract out of events in Europe or the wider world, whatever the
Euro-sceptics may wish. Meanwhile a simple programme* for European revival
has been presented by none other than the international financier, George
Soros. His success in speculating against sterling in the face of a
wide-open opportunity should not elevate him to the status of prophet; nor
should it cause his policy proposals to be sniffily brushed aside. They
deserve a hearing on their merits.
His first suggestion is that the French authorities should take advantage of
the disappearance of the narrow ERM band to reduce short-term interest rates
now by about 3 percentage points. This should preferably be done in
conjunction with other members of the ERM and with a negotiated extension to
two years of the French debt to the Bundesbank, arising out of this summer's
support operations.
A reduction in French interest rates has been proposed frequently enough.
But a newer element is provided by the second Soros suggestion that the
resulting appreciation of the D-Mark, and the consequent weakening of the
German economy, would hasten the reduction in German interest rates. The net
result would be a European recovery, in which Germany would eventually join,
and in the end a pattern of exchange rates not far different from that
prevailing this summer before the collapse of the narrow ERM band.
It is however the financier's third proposal that differentiates his package
from the common run. This is that after about two years some countries would
be able to move to a common currency directly, without reinstituting the
narrow bands. Thus the present vicious circle of European disintegration
could be turned round into a virtuous one.
What is not generally known is that the early stages, at least, of something
close to the Soros package very nearly got under way earlier this year. For
at the meetings of the EC Committee of Central Bank Governors, called to
consider the 'fault lines' in the ERM after Britain's departure, the
Bundesbank proposed a temporary widening of the ERM margins. Because the
proposals were given the thumbs down by partner countries, Bundesbank
representatives never got as far as proposing a specific range. But what
they had in mind was something like a 6 to 10 per cent margin on either side
of the central parity. This would have been enough to give France and other
countries much more room for manoeuvre on interest rates, without destroying
the medium-term credibility of the ERM.
It was because of the rejection of this proposal that the EC Central
Bankers' Committee, in common with the Monetary Committee, issued a thin
report, suggesting no more than minimum changes in the ERM and implying that
everything would have been all right if the UK had joined at an appropriate
exchange rate and kept to the rules of the game.
German representatives had another go during the fateful weekend meeting of
July 31 and August 1, called in response to the tidal wave of speculation
that had hit the French franc. As is known, they proposed a temporary
floating of the D-Mark, while allowing the rest of the ERM to continue. The
Netherlands announced that it would stay with the D-Mark and Belgium
threatened to do the same after objecting to the German proposal. What is
not so well known is that almost every other ERM member, including countries
such as Denmark and Ireland, threatened to stick with the D-Mark. In that
case the French franc would have been left to depreciate alone, precisely
the result that the French prime minister, Edouard Balladur, was determined
to avoid because of his no-devaluation pledge.
A TAX SUGGESTION
Meanwhile the British chancellor has to consider what to do in the face of a
large budget deficit, which he cannot rely on righting itself, and in the
face of a fragile UK recovery. The first consideration points to financial
tightening and the second to loosening, or at least doing nothing.
Two remarkably similar attempts have been made to square this circle, one by
the Institute for Fiscal Studies in its Green Budget prepared in
collaboration with Goldman Sachs. The other has been made by the Panel of
Independent Forecasters established by the Treasury.
In the recent past, fiscal policy has been less potent than expected and
monetary policy more potent. But that does not justify writing off fiscal
policy altogether. The Green Budget authors do not support hysterical talk
about an immediate fiscal crisis. Nor, to be more practical, does the 1 1/2
percentage point reduction in gilt-edged yields so far this year suggest
such a crisis.
Nevertheless if the debt ratio is to stabilise at just over 50 per cent of
GNP, which it is likely to reach by the late 1990s, then the Green Budget
estimates that the PSBR will have to come down from its present 8 per cent
of GNP to around 2 1/2 per cent. (This assumes that inflation is also 2 1/2
per cent.) A similar target estimate is reached if the object is to
stabilise the net assets of the public sector.
The Green Budget authors suggest that a cumulative tax-increasing package of
Pounds 6bn should be phased in over the period up to 1996-97, but that only,
say, Pounds 1bn of tax increases should be announced for next year. They
also recommend that there should be even more interest rate cuts if fiscal
tightening restrains the economy.
Several reservations must be registered. First, interest rates cannot be
determined irrespective of what is happening in other countries. The British
have already had the one-off depreciation recommended for France by Soros.
Second, Norman Lamont already used to the maximum the Augustinian strategy
of 'fiscal virtue but not yet', to the tune of Pounds 10bn per annum of tax
increases in the pipeline for the next two years. Further doses would deepen
consumer pessimism.
Third, the authors try too hard to be shadow political strategists for the
Tories (irrespective of their personal political views). Hence their
reluctance to leave tax decisions for later Budgets nearer an election.
Their main job should, however, be to lay out appropriate economic policies
before going on to discuss how politics may distort policies. Fourth, the
authors too quickly dismiss the question of spending reforms. Here again the
authors try too hard to be politically realistic. But even if worthwhile
reforms cannot take effect in this parliament, early legislation would cast
a shadow beforehand.
In fact, a modest amendment to the Green Budget proposals would transform
them into common sense. The Green Budget argues for phasing out mortgage
interest relief and restricting the value of the main personal allowance to
the 20 per cent income tax starting rate. Such changes have the advantage of
not increasing the most conspicuous marginal tax rates and - unlike VAT
widening - of not having a knock-on effect on the RPI.
If these changes are desirable for their own sake, why not announce a
definite timetable for them? But instead of presenting them as net tax
increases, the chancellor should leave open - and not just in the small
print - the possibility of offsetting tax reductions if the economic
situation either permits or demands such cuts. Of course, UK mainstream
economists turn pale at the mention of tax cuts, even as part of a neutral
package. Another flavour should be given to the debate.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Arts: Mr and Mrs Nobody
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pooter is the very model of John Major's diary in Private Eye. Here is a
conventionally decent man recording everyday events in a slightly complacent
way while not wholly understanding what is going on around him.
Shaming admission: I had not read The Diary of a Nobody until I was doing my
homework for this play. Everything that has been said in praise of the book,
which began as a series of diaries in the late 19th century Punch, is
absolutely right. The book is brilliant.
The trouble with Mr and Mrs Nobody, the stage adaptation by Keith
Waterhouse, is that it is Mrs Pooter's Diary as well as Mr's. As Waterhouse
freely admits, he was at least as intrigued by Carrie Pooter as by her
husband, Charles. So he devised the wife's diary to go alongside the
original 'with the two journals fighting it out, so to speak, as they
provide often conflicting accounts of the same event'.
This is a fatal mistake. Private Eye has shown that you must choose one
partner or the other. With Harold Wilson you chose Mary; with Margaret
Thatcher it was obviously Denis, and with the Majors it is John. The result
is a one-eyed view of the world, but amusing, ironical and often perceptive,
just like Pooter.
The Waterhouse version is not new. It has a six month run at the Lyric in
Shaftesbury Avenue in 1986, starring Judi Dench and Michael Williams. The
1993 revival stars no less than Patricia Routledge and Clive Swift. And the
lovely Richmond Theatre was packed with expectation.
Seldom has one heard so few laughs in a show designed to amuse. Not much
pathos in the Pooter life either. The few good scenes are concentrated on
songs around the piano: they could come from anywhere.
Times, fashions change. Mr and Mrs Nobody may have worked in 1986. What Ms
Routledge and Clive Swift are doing in a piece like this, directed by
Matthew Francis of the excellent Greenwich Theatre, and produced by Duncan C
Weldon who has an eye for the West End, in the year 1993 is beyond
comprehension. So many talents; so few rewards. The production ought to be
stopped in its tracks before there is a real disaster.
Richmond Theatre until Saturday. (081) 940 0220

FT  21 OCT 93 / Arts: Pacific Overtures - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Leicester Haymarket has acquired a reputation as one of the country's
leading homes for musicals; and this staging of Stephen Sondheim's 1976
musical Pacific Overtures shows you why. The large company, with 16
performers playing several roles each, performs on a high level, Paul
Kerryson's staging is deft and eloquent, and Charles Cusick-Smith's designs
are striking.
Pacific Overtures (best known in this country from an English National Opera
staging) portrays the events of 1853, when, after 250 years of isolation,
the Japanese first established contact with western society. The central
irony is that the tale is told as if from the Japanese point of view, and
illustrated with key features of Japanese theatre: onnegata, whereby female
roles are played by men; kabuki, whose bold maquillage and coiffures are
employed, even for the American characters; and bunraku, whereby certain
silent figures in black attire behave like puppeteers.
There are many shrewd musico-dramatic strokes. Perhaps the most telling is
the one in which three British sailors climb over a wall and accost a young
Japanese woman. The trio they sing at her is gentle, plaintive, and its
overlap of three separate voices is exquisite. Such delicacy] But what they
are attempting is rape, and she (played by a man) sits there in the middle
of her trap, trembling in terror all the while. Elsewhere, the story
Sondheim tells is multi-faceted, with scenes of comedy, love, grief, and
conflict.
The Leicester staging is virtually flawless. Russell Dixon takes the central
role of narrator and Shogun with command. Amid the excellent supporting
cast, three are outstanding: Scott Davies as Kayama (a minor official
catapulted into the forefront of international negotiations), Michael Heath
as the Shogun's knowing mother ('Chrysanthemum tea'), and Peter Edbrook as a
madam training her 'girls' to receive the invading Americans. The only flaws
are that 'Pretty lady' should be more mellifluous, and the big dances lack
variety.
And yet, and yet . . . The more Sondheim you know, the less there is. I
acknowledge his finesse and his urbanity. But oh, how all those smart little
cycles of clever worldweariness weigh one down. So many rhymes are
insistently milked. So many lines are just four, six, or eight syllables
long. So many phrases are strings of evenly weighted syllables until the
last is prolonged.
Sondheim is often praised for steering his idiom clear of the rock musical.
True, Sondheim's urbanity is a cut above the crudities of Les Mis or
Phantom. But what are you to make of a modern musical composer who not only
does not rock but also cannot even swing? He seems both glib and repressed.
Pacific Overtures has plenty of japonaiserie - plus minimalism of a
generally exotic type; but these features are only skin deep. Au fond,
Sondheim's musical style is just an ever so refined version of old
vaudeville formulae. The overall effect is sophisticated, trite, and, above
all, anaemic.
Sometimes, listening to Pacific Overtures, I thought 'This is his best
musical.' I would not, however, care to work out which is his worst. Or to
calculate what little difference there is between the two. Bygone innocence
is forever counterposed by present dissatisfaction. Nostalgia and cynicism
rule. The modernisation (Americanisation) of world culture that afflicts
Japan here is the same as afflicts art in Sunday in the Park. Worse,
Sondheim's characters lack force and scale. Beneath all that polish lies a
depressing meagreness of spirit.
At the Haymarket Theatre, Leicester, until November 6

If you have not already had your fill of documentaries about drugs, then
Critical Eye: Deadly Bliss (C4, 9.00) may be of interest. It assesses what
can be done about drug addiction in Britain in the light of strategies being
tried in the Harlem district of New York.
Skiers may be surprised to hear of the damage their sport inflicts on the
environment - they should watch Living Dangerously: Save The Alps (BBC1,
8.30). Bearded vultures have been forced to fly from their eyries due to the
installation of ski-lifts. The Aga Khan heads an international project to
bring back this bird of prey.
Napoleon is said to have offered a prize of FFr12,000 to anyone who could
solve the problem of feeding his armies. A Frenchmen invented the bottling
method, whereupon an Englishman invented the iron canister. These and many
more interesting facts are revealed by Small Objects of Desire: The Tin Can
(BBC2, 10.10.)
Hear My Song (C4, 10.00) was a surprisingly successful movie for one without
a great deal of action. The music and funny scenes carry it along however.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Arts: Grigorovich's young dancers - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The evening could not have had a more unpromising start. Yury Grigorovich's
Ballet of the Bolshoi Theatre, a troupe of young dancers chosen from schools
and companies across Russia, was embarking upon a brief regional tour. The
Corn Exchange Hall in Cambridge is un-raked, so that even from my privileged
placing, feet were often invisible. The curtain rose - after a false start -
and there we were at the court of King Lurex XIV. The programme book
(coloured pictures; no details as to casting: price Pounds 4) alleged that
this was a 'suite' from The Sleeping Beauty. What we saw was the first act
garland waltz, most of the wedding scene (with a couple of vicious musical
cuts: the score is taped), and a stage flimsily decorated, not least by
pudding-faces in tinsel crowns, uneasy expressions, and costumes which I
think I recognise from Grigorovich's Swan Lake, who must deck the edges of
the action and pretend to be regal or courtly in their Mary Pickford wigs
and reach-me-down robes.
I would venture that in no other theatre art are performances of the staple
repertory so brightly and unwarrantedly optimistic as in ballet.
Incompetents trip about, gulling a public into supposing they are seeing
Swan Lake, or similar lures for the unwary, in productions of miserable
ineptitude. These grand ballets are opera house fare, demanding dancers of
the most serious accomplishment, and stagings respectful and imaginative.
Anything else is an insult to the work, to the audience, and to the art of
ballet itself.
This Beauty was, shall we say, unlikely. Yury Grigorovich, whom I admire
tremendously for what he has achieved during three decades as master of the
Bolshoi Ballet - through periods of political and artistic stagnation and
uncertainty he has kept the company vital - loves and honours the classics,
as we know from his productions. His young troupe does not possess artists
able as yet to make sense of Beauty's massive demands, in technique or
style.
The Aurora (Elena Kniazkova) was a soubrette; the Bluebird was a
spindle-shanked youth who looked as if he should have been in bed hours
before - in a few years time he may indeed become a Bluebird, but at the
moment he is physically immature. The other dancers marked time (if corps de
ballet) or dashed off their solos as if eager to get them over with. Only
the Lilac Fairy (Natalia Bashkatova) suggested something radiant and apt for
the ballet.
By the interval I wondered if flight were not the most honourable critical
response. Duty prevailed. I stayed, and I was glad I stayed. The second part
of the evening brought divertissements from the traditional repertory which
made sense of Grigorovich's idea of a 'young' ballet, and of the subtext of
the evening, which is the Russian heritage of classical training and
performance. The dancers suddenly looked like dancers, at ease with their
art. Interpretations were, in the main, rewarding. The repertory was
predictable - Black Swan; Don Quixote of course, - but offered one gem in
The Naiad and the Fisherman which is a not wholly suspect survivor from the
1850s. It was made by Jules Perrot in St. Petersburg. How it has survived
(and how much has survived) can be debated: but its steps, like its Pugni
music, are pretty and credible without being egregiously quaint, as six
girls and two boys surround a principal couple with bright, buoyant dances.
I liked Maria Mosina and Andrey Evdokimov as they sparkled through it, just
as I admired Tatiana Ledovskikh in the third act duet from Swan Lake, to
which she brought mature understanding and a sense of theatre. Some of the
bravura tricks fell apart. This did not matter: she gave us a true and
distinguished interpretation.
The young also romped through the tango from The Golden Age - kittens
playing at being naughty tigers - and a couple of other numbers. More
enthusiasm than polish at times, and some dubious playing to the public, but
performances were life-size. So much of the ballet we see in Britain looks
polite, pinched, scaled down to fit into notions about the niceness of
classical dancing as an activity for little girls. Yury Grigorovich's young
show us that it is an art to which you must give yourself without reserve,
and with joy.
The Grigorovich Ballet can been seen in Eastbourne on October 20; then in
Jersey on October 22, 23, and in Cork on October 28,29,30.

THE CEMENT GARDEN (18) Andrew Birkin
MR WONDERFUL (12) Anthony Minghella
DRAGON - THE BRUCE LEE STORY (15) Rob Cohen
ONCE UPON A FOREST (U) Charles Grosvenor
HOMEWARD BOUND (U) Duwayne Dunham
MANUFACTURING CONSENT Peter Wintonick and Mark Achbar
We have heard much about family values recently. Across the land, wild
untamed Conservatives have inveighed against single parents and their drain
on the nation's money and morals. The media have taken up the theme; clerics
have cried 'Yes]' or 'No]'; and civilisation has stood on tiptoe, awaiting
the verdict.
Now here is a film on the subject. But Andrew Birkin's The Cement Garden,
based on Ian McEwan's novel, addresses the theme of family values (at least
the Tory-hallowed version) much as a wrecking ball might address a
cathedral. There is dying Mum (Sinead Cusack), soon to be buried by her
children in the cellar. There is Dad (Hans Zischler), taken off by a heart
attack while eccentrically cementing over the garden ('It'll be that much
tidier'). And there is teenaged son Jack (Andrew Robertson) who grows out of
his narcissist pleasure in mirrors to enjoy a fullblooded heterosexual
liaison with his sister (Charlotte Gainsbourg). Did we mention the younger
siblings, Sue and cross-dressing Tom? Just as well.
Slouching towards Britain to be born, this film has already won a brace of
festival prizes including Best Director at Berlin. Birkin comes to it after
one stylish, star-crossed previous feature Burning Secret. (The star who
crossed it was Faye 'Ready for my fiftieth close-up' Dunaway). Here he has
compromised not a jot. The movie is a picture of Hell that keeps shimmering,
like those trompe l'oeil double-image postcards, into a glimpse of Heaven.
The images range from bilious sunsets to interiors as grey and grungy as
last month's cheese. The dialogue has a gnomic, comic gaucherie enhanced by
its sense of semi-detachment from some of the foreign players. (This is a
German-French-English co-production.) And the film's loopy serenity, against
many odds, becomes a joy.
Even the in-your-face nepotism of the casting, with Birkin's son and niece
(Mlle Gainsbourg) in leading roles, seems right in this tale of cabin fever
domesticity spiralling into incest. For the reason the children conceal
Mum's corpse in cement is that they hope to stay together and avoid
orphanages. But the family that stays together may end up doing a lot of
other things together.
Like any McEwan story, The Cement Garden has a cinegenic eeriness alive with
surreal incidentals. Birkin places the family's house, a concrete box in
British Bauhaus style, in a weed-and-rubble wasteland that might have been
designed by TS Eliot. Here the characters come and go, talking of emotional
vertigo. And the sense of existential cadenza - not so much a programme for
revolt, more a slow dive into hedonism as a sweet and least-resitance way of
life - is conveyed by the laid-back, perfectly judged performances.
Indeed the marvel of The Cement Garden is its poker-faced detachment. Birkin
asks no questions, gives no answers, tells no lies. He is a fly on the wall
 -one of several - in a household where human nature and human order,
deprived of parental censure, is returning to basics. Strip away
civilisation as we know it, suggests the movie, and boys will be boys, girls
will be girls and each, more than likely, will end up trying to be the
other.
Anthony Minghella's Mr Wonderful is more upbeat about family values. Like
the Tories the movie curses the unmarried state, but as much for money
reasons as for moral ones. Alimony-stung blue-collar worker Matt Dillon
cannot get out of the financial hole he is in. (Cue symbolic shots of him in
a hole in the road working for New York's electricity company Con Edison).
He wants to join his mates in a money-making enterprise: rebuilding a
derelict bowling alley. But look] His pockets are empty and ex-wife
Annabella Sciorra will never let him off the maintenance hook while she
remains unmarried.
Lightbulb idea] What if Dillon finds a 'Mr Wonderful' for her? Then he can
live happily ever after with his girlfriend (Mary-Louise Parker), plus his
bowling alley buddies and lots of money.
After Minghella's Truly, Madly, Deeply, this film is truly, maddeningly
shallow. Taking over an original script by Amy Schor and Vicki Polon, the
British playwright-filmmaker has first endorsed its sentimental excesses and
then allowed composer Michael Gore to pour musical syrup over it (warbling,
wall-to-wall jazz). Worse still, whenever Dillon, Sciorra and Parker look
like establishing a base-camp adequacy with their roles, Minghella brings on
supporting star William Hurt, who strides past them with goggles and pitons
towards the peak.
Hurt is superb as Sciorra's current boyfriend: a sad-sack college professor
who knows that his older, married status sentences him to an unspecified
hour of doom. Listen to the lifetime of caustic despair in his pronunciation
of the word 'Gus]' (Dillon). Watch his face grimace with irony as he
comments on Dillon's IQ: 'He's not exactly plagued with ideas, is he?' For
of course Sciorra's real Mr Wonderful - we can see it coming from the other
side of New York State - is none other than her ex-Mr Wonderful, Mr Dillon.
Cue contrived reunion, climactic tears and even more of that warbling jazz
music.
The first ever professional review I wrote was of a 1969 film called
Marlowe. It starred James Garner as Chandler's gumshoe, but neither I nor
anyone else back then noticed Garner. The film was stolen in a small role by
a yowling, kicking, seemingly stark-mad Oriental called Bruce Lee. Here was
a young actor born to defy gravity, smash furniture and imitate the searing
cries of an impaled banshee.
This debut movie does not figure in Dragon - The Bruce Lee Story. But then
neither does much else of interest. Faithful to Lee's wife's official
biography, it stomps blandly on from one career crossroads to the next as
our hero, played by the unrelated Jason Scott Lee, climbs from Hong Kong
poverty to Hollywood glory. The fight scenes are frequent and daft. The
romantic scenes are frequent and dull. And when Robert Wagner wanders into
the plot wearing an industrial-strength suntan and gold medallion -
sign-language for 'bigshot film producer' - one senses the entire movie
sinking slowly into oblivion.
Lee deserves a good film. His legend is among the weirdest of modern times:
even his gift for early mortality (he died at 32) being handed on
dynastically to his actor son Brandon, shot dead this year by mysterious
accident on a film set. But Dragon is not a biopic, more a large glossy PR
brochure punched with sprocket-holes.
Once Upon A Forest is about a hedgehog, mole and mouse who trek across a
forest poisoned by a chemical spill to find medicinal herbs for a dying
badger. It is - you guessed - an animated feature. But 'animated' hardly
seems the mot juste for this latest eco-lecture from the industry that
brought us FernGully: The Last Rain Forest. Winsomely characterised, dully
scored, it relies on two guest voices - Michael Crawford's as old Cornelius
Badger and Ben Vereen as a hot-gospelling marsh bird - to kick it into life
for two brief song-and-dance numbers.
Better is Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey. Here the guest voices are
Don Ameche, Michael J Fox and Sally Fox, dubbing real not cartoon animals.
Two dogs and a cat, sundered from their human owners, set out home across
hundreds of miles of danger-infested Sierra Nevada.
For dumb animals, they deal in a lot of smart dialogue. 'I hate fast food'
cracks the Fox dog as a breakfast-earmarked rabbit hightails out of his
reach. But then 30 years have gone by since Disney first filmed this story,
based on Sheila Burnford's novel. We now have an entire generation of
streetwise, short-attention-span brats who if the animals do not talk will
probably rush straight from the cinema and back to their Nintendo games.
What would Professor Noam Chomsky, prophet of our communications era and
America's favourite thorn-in-the-side radical, make of it all? Find out in
Manufacturing Consent. I found this 2 3/4 -hour docu-portrait riveting even
though I disagree with nearly all Chomsky's views. The film has been seen
before on TV, but not at this uncut, unexpurgated and wholly unboring
length.
