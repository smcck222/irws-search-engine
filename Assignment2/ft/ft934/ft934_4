FT  21 DEC 93 / Survey of Sweden (10): The prospects for economic recovery -
Interview: Professor Assar Lindbeck
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Professor Assar Lindbeck is the head of the committee which chooses Nobel
Prize winners in economics. Earlier this year he headed the Lindbeck
Commission, which provided the government with the most detailed critique of
the country's economic and political problems for a generation. Proposing no
fewer than 113 reforms of the current system, the report mapped out a path
to economic recovery. Professor Lindbeck discussed the prospects for that
recovery with Christopher Brown-Humes:
Question: What is the short-term outlook for the economy?
Answer: I think we have bottomed out in all respects. Production and
manufacturing went down by 17 per cent from the top in 1989 to the bottom in
December 1992, but from January this year it has increased by about 8 per
cent. That reflects the dual economy. We have very high growth in the
manufacturing sector and exports but still falling domestic aggregate
demand.
What is still going down is building activity because that was blown up to
such a bubble during the 1980s. And municipalities are financially squeezed
and will continue to shed labour.
The crucial thing is what happens to private consumption because that is 55
per cent of GNP. The savings rate in the housing sector was minus 5 per cent
at the end of the 1980s; now it's plus 11 per cent. If this doesn't change
then the economy will continue to go down.
Will devaluation's gains be eroded as rapidly as they were in the 1980s?
There are some dramatic differences. In the 1980s unemployment never went
above 3.5 per cent; now it's 8 per cent, and 15 per cent if you include
those on training schemes. The other difference is that in the 80s you had
so many unique expansionary activities such as the building boom and the
deregulation of the capital markets. In the 80s you spoilt devaluation's
gains in five years between 1982 and 1987. They will probably last more than
five years this time.
What about the long-term development of Swedish competitiveness?
The social security system is being cut down to size. We suggested in the
report that benefit levels should not be higher than 70 or 80 per cent of
previous income. Now it is down to 80 per cent and there is a waiting period
before you get sick compensation. That has brought lower absenteeism. In the
late 1980s people were away from work with claimed sickness for 25 days a
year on average and if you include absenteeism for other reasons, like sick
relatives, it was 50 days.
Taxation of small firms is also being changed. Small firms play a much
smaller role in Sweden than in other European countries and when you look at
the tax system and regulation, you realise what an extraordinarily hostile
environment they have had for 25 years. That has changed dramatically.
To what extent has the public understood the change that has taken place?
People have been shocked by what has happened. They have found out that
Sweden was an ordinary country: we were not a planet outside the solar
system in its own orbit governed by laws legislated by labour unions and
labour market board.
The question is, do people believe it's just a temporary shock and you can
return to the old ways later on? I think many people do. The dilemma is that
55-60 per cent of the electorate get at least 80 per cent of their income
from the public sector. How do you reform the public sector when the
majority of the electorate live on tax money?
Today we have 137 tax-financed people for every 100 market-financed people.
Holland is worried because they have 70 tax-financed for every 100
market-financed. This explains the extraordinary tax burden and public
spending being 70 per cent of GNP. It also explains why you get such
enormous protests every time you try to cut something because you have
created these vested interests in public spending.
My advice to any country that is spending 40-50 of GNP in the public sector
is don't increase it because it's hopeless to get it down again. It needs
politicians with a suicidal instinct to take public spending down from 70 to
50 per cent of GNP. Anne Wibble (the Swedish finance minister) has such
suicidal instincts so from that point of view she's useful.
Is Sweden going to have to get used to unemployment at the levels we are
seeing now?
No, but we are not going to go down to the 1.5 per cent level we saw in
1989. Maybe we can get down to an open unemployment level of 3-4 per cent,
with a further 2 per cent on training schemes. But certain things have to be
done. Firstly, job security legislation has to be changed so that small
firms dare to hire. They don't dare to hire in a world of uncertainty
because it's too expensive to fire people. Secondly, future jobs have to be
created in the private services sector, which means reducing tax wedges.
The third factor is wages for low-skilled workers. In Sweden an 18-year-old
industrial worker has a salary which is 85 per cent of what a 34-year-old
earns, despite lacking skills, training and experience. It was only 55 per
cent 20 years ago. It has to go down to 55 per cent again, but it will be a
very painful process because it's against the ideology of the labour unions.
Is there scope for further cuts in interest rates?
Yes, for two reasons. One is that recession is so deep on the continent that
we have to expect cuts in interest rates there. Secondly, I think there is
some improvement in the budget deficit. The debt office reports a profound
improvement in the cash position of the government in the last three or four
months. That's important because many financial institutions were
forecasting a further deterioration of the budget deficit. I would think
lower rates were more likely than unchanged rates.
What is the outlook for the krona?
The exchange rate is undervalued in terms of competitiveness. But there are
still expectations of a further fall in the krona. How can that be? Because
people are not confident that Swedish politicians can control the deficit or
that the decisions so far have been credible enough. You have to be tough in
the sense that you make a credible commitment to solve the budget crisis
over a five-year period. On the other hand, you have to choose timing so
that you don't drive the economy down further.
How much inflationary pressure is there in the economy?
The risk for a new round of wage increases is modest when you have
unemployment of 8-15 per cent. Inflation went up from 2 to 5 per cent after
the devaluation, but now it's on the 2 per cent path again. But what happens
in the next upswing? Will wage earners try to get revenge? That's a risk,
particularly if people drop out from the labour force and cause bottlenecks
for skilled workers. You can get inflation problems even if unemployment is
6 per cent if the skill and regional mix is bad and you move too fast.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Survey of Sweden (11): Pragmatic party leader - Profile:
Ingvar Carlsson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two years ago, when the Social Democrats were turfed out office after
slumping to their worst election result since the 1920s, many people were
ready to ring the death-knell for the party and the edifice of industrial
welfarism it had crafted.
But with a new election less than a year away and the Social Democrats
winning as much as 50 per cent support in the opinion polls, Mr Ingvar
Carlsson, party leader, has every prospect of once again becoming prime
minister. From his vantage point, both the Social Democratic Party and the
'Swedish model' are very much alive.
'I don't think the party is in a crisis, although the country is in very bad
shape,' he says.
'We have always been a pragmatic party. We never nationalised much. But we
want a society where there are no great differences between the working
class and the upper class. We want social security guaranteed for all. And
here I see no bad signs for our party with respect to ideology. Look at the
United States. After a decade or more of neo-liberalism, one of President
Clinton's big tasks now is to have health insurance, which is more similar
to our ideas than to conservative ideas.'
He cites recent local election successes for the Social Democrats in Germany
and the Democratic Left in Italy. Italy's former communists are bona fide
social democrats, he says.
'I think the pendulum will now swing back towards our policy where it is
necessary through certain political action to correct the market and create
greater security for people.'
Mr Carlsson, who was 59 last month, became party leader and prime minister
in the most traumatic of circumstances, succeeding when Mr Olaf Palme was
assassinated by a still unknown gunman in February 1986. Mr Carlsson went on
to lead the Social Democrats to victory in the 1988 election.
In that government, he proved his own leadership credentials when he
undertook two important shifts in party policy. As the balance between the
ever-expanding public sector and the private economy skewed, threatening to
make worse a looming recession, Mr Carlsson presided over a significant
reform of Sweden's notoriously high income taxes. Then, in July 1991, he
overturned decades of Social Democratic orthodoxy by lodging Sweden's
application to join the European Community, or Union as it has since become.
It did not save the party from defeat in the 1991 election. But Mr Carlsson
survived as leader, maintaining the pro-EU policy and co-operating for many
months on economic policy with Mr Carl Bildt's conservative-led government
to help steer the country through the worst of the currency and economic
crisis of 1992.
The Social Democrats are careful to stress their pragmatism and are unlikely
to reverse the welfare reforms carried out by Mr Bildt. But those days of
co-operation are now firmly over. Mr Carlsson is keen to stress the
differences between his and the government's economic policies.
He rejects, for example, the central platform of the present coalition that
an oversized public sector is the main cause of Sweden's economic woes and
its huge budget deficit.
'I think it is definitely the wrong analysis. I think you have to go much
deeper than this, because we had this large public sector for many years. In
my opinion, the real problem is that we have negative growth. The cake we
produce is too small and that is what we have to do something about. When
you look at the budget deficit, according to our analysis about three
quarters is due to unemployment. Here is where we have to focus.
'That is one of my main arguments on why Sweden should join the EU. The
strategy against unemployment is at least much easier to outline if we do it
together with other European countries. You can take much larger risks in
the policy of expansion and growth if you do it simultaneously.' He wants to
put the emphasis back on stimulating demand and generating industrial
growth. If the Social Democrats lead the next government, he declares:
'There will be a more positive attitude towards industry.
'We have always pushed for a very positive industrial policy. That doesn't
mean we believe in reducing taxes for the shareholders, but we must have an
increase in industrial investment, and we must have a demand for industrial
products.
'A more efficient, a more competitive and a broader industrial sector will
be the main objective. I think the financial markets in the world will be a
little bit surprised. We had a huge increase in industrial development in
the 1980s which people now tend to forget.'
But, again, comes the line that the Social Democrats are nothing if not
pragmatic. The unstated message seems to be that while the aim is to
preserve the essential elements of the welfare state, the party will equally
try not to disrupt essential market forces.
'We are not doctrinaire,' says Mr Carlsson. 'We say we would like to see
what is best in every single situation. We are certainly aware that Sweden
is in a very difficult situation; a dangerous crisis. We will not come up
with a lot of promises other than that we will concentrate on solving the
economic crisis and getting people back to work.'

FT  21 DEC 93 / Survey of Sweden (9): Formidable twin challenge ahead -
Prime Minister Carl Bildt talks to Hugh Carnegy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The opinion polls are against him, but Mr Carl Bildt, prime minister,
appears to relish the formidable twin challenge facing him next year of
winning a general election and turning around public hostility to Sweden's
application to join the European Union.
As youthful and energetic as ever after two tough years in office, the
44-year-old leader of the Moderate Party (politically, the Moderates are
conservatives) insists it is possible to overcome the lowly image the EU has
taken on and repulse the offensive of the Social Democratic opposition in
spite of having presided over a painful recession that has driven
unemployment to levels unimaginable in Sweden a few years ago.
If he succeeds, Mr Bildt will have achieved his two principal political
goals: to lead Sweden politically, economically and irrevocably into the
heart of Europe and to complete the country's transformation from state
domination to an open, market-driven economy.
Mr Bildt's normally cheerful good temper has sometimes frayed as the
negotiations with the EU on an accession agreement approach a climax. Even
Sweden's greatest advocate of European integration bridles at examples of
'Brussels' interference in the way of life of ordinary Swedes' - such as the
EU's ban on 'snus', the orally-taken wet snuff that is so popular among
Swedes.
But he has soldiered on with his regular Monday campaign around the country,
trying to persuade a sceptical electorate that joining the EU is 'an
overriding national issue'.
'I feel a mood of great interest, especially among young people,' he said in
an interview. 'But they don't yet feel all their questions have been
answered.'
When the promised referendum on EU membership will be held is not yet clear.
So increasingly the more compelling public issue is next September's general
election, which current opinion polls suggest the Social Democrats will win.
But Mr Bildt firmly rejects the Social Democratic claim that the political
pendulum in Sweden is swinging away from his brand of liberal conservatism.
'They have said that for the past 15 years and they are wrong,' he retorts.
'They are the ones who are adjusting in our direction. They now talk about
the market economy in a way they would not have dared a couple of years ago.
'The overall direction of policy that we see in western Europe is very much
in the direction of further liberalisation; further deregulation of markets;
of opening up.'
He warms to the theme. 'In Sweden, I am, of course, radical and the Social
Democrats are the conservatives, bordering on reactionary. They are the
barons of the old order.
'They are resisting change much in the same way that in the mid-19th
century, which was a period in Sweden of very rapid liberalisation, you also
had the barons of the old order resisting change.'
He points out that in the 100 years to 1970, Sweden experienced growth
unmatched in the world, but that this ground to a halt in the next two
decades, a period in which the vaunted 'Swedish model' of industrial
welfarism reached its apogee.
'There was something fundamentally wrong with the policies that were pursued
during the 1970s and 1980s. I, of course, associate that with the dramatic
rise we had in the tax burden, with regulation and the role of public
expenditure in the economy. If that was part of the model it was a model
that clearly failed.
'We had enormous increases in transfer payments without increases in
production. We became the sickest society in Europe in terms of absentee
rates. We have seen during the past years productivity improving
dramatically - in the private sector primarily but now in the public sector
as well. We are becoming competitive now and with the changes under way
there should be an entirely new entrepreneurial climate in Sweden.'
The change in direction has been accompanied, however, by unemployment
approaching 14 per cent, an expensive banking crisis, a crash in house
prices, cuts in social benefits, a huge budget deficit and rapidly
escalating levels of government borrowing which combine to give the Social
Democrats considerable ammunition.
But Mr Bildt has so far skilfully managed his minority coalition with the
Liberal, Centre and Christian Democratic parties, keeping the government
united without a single cabinet change since it took office in late 1991.
Now, he says, the pay-off is beginning to show through.
'When we started off I said our aim was to get growth rates back to those in
comparable European countries by the mid-1990s - we haven't been there for
25 years - and to create the conditions for having growth rates well above
the European average by the latter part of the century. That is perfectly
feasible if we continue our policies.'
The question is whether the electorate will vote for more of the Bildt
prescription, which has proved so painful for so many.
'The mood of the country is a realistic one,' he says, adding that his
government is less unpopular now than the previous Social Democratic
administration was at an equivalent stage.
'The difference is, we will have a situation where the economy is seen to be
improving. So I am always saying that I will be surprised if we don't have a
non-socialist majority after the elections. The margins are very tight -
much tighter than most people realise.'

FT  21 DEC 93 / Survey of Sweden (7): Mood of profound scepticism - Sweden
and the European Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As many Mondays as he can, Mr Carl Bildt, Sweden's prime minister, heads off
to various towns and villages around the country to drum up support for
Swedish membership of the European Union. Judging by the latest opinion
polls, he might well think his time could be better spent.
Swedes, like their Nordic neighbours in Finland and Norway, are profoundly
sceptical about European Union membership, and if anything their opposition
has increased as 1993 has progressed.
The mood suggests the pro-EU lobby is going to have to fight all the way to
make Swedish accession a reality by the targeted date of January 1 1995. The
very least that will be required for a 'yes' vote in next year's referendum
is a successful outcome to the entry negotiations, and that is still by no
means guaranteed.
Recent opinion polls have given the anti-EU camp 45-48 per cent support and
those backing membership a mere 26-30 per cent. The No vote may have slipped
a little from its peak, but the last time that more people were in favour of
membership than against it was in March 1992.
Although business and leading politicians broadly support the EU, many other
groups in society are largely opposed to it, including women, young people
and blue collar workers. In addition there are deep splits within a number
of political parties. The leaders of the Social Democrats, the Centre Party
and the Christian Democrats, which all support membership, are to a greater
or lesser extent out of line with their membership, who are against.
Internal EU disarray over matters such as Maastricht, unemployment and
Yugoslavia has undoubtedly complicated the task of those seeking to get to
Sweden into the union. But many Swedes seem to have deep-seated emotional
reasons for their opposition: they implicitly link the EU with the wider
process of change which has brought deep cuts to the welfare state and a
sharp rise in unemployment.
They also have a strong sense of pride in a system which, notwithstanding
the difficulties of the past three years, has brought the country tremendous
economic success over the past 50 years. They do not want to head into the
unknown and risk a wholesale dismantling of that system if they can no see
no tangible benefits from EU membership in return.
That is part of the problem. Sweden is due to join the European Economic
Area (EEA) alongside other European Free Trade Association (Efta) countries
on January 1 1994, and in doing so will become part of a barrier-free
trading region which stretches from the Arctic to the Mediterranean. Why go
further and sign up for the EU? For all that politicians stress that Sweden
will gain more influence, most Swedes worry that they will simply get more
interference.
The feedback from the negotiations, which began in February of this year,
has done much to encourage this view.
Swedish politicians have time and again accused the European Commission of
being insensitive on 'Nordic' questions such as wet snuff and alcohol
policy. The Commission has indicated it would like to ban wet snuff, known
in Sweden as 'snus', and scrap the Nordic countries' monopoly on alcohol
imports and distribution. But one in 10 Swedes is a regular snuff-taker, and
the country has a strong temperance lobby.
It is not surprising, therefore, that there have been warnings of a backlash
against Brussels' interference in Sweden's domestic policies and traditions
 -and fears that if the Commission does not give way, the referendum will be
lost.
In many ways these 'symbolic' issues have come to assume greater importance
in Sweden than matters such as agriculture and regional policy, to which
Finland and Norway have given greater weight. Environmental policy also
falls into this category, the worry being that public opinion will be
negatively influenced if Sweden is forced to lower its standards.
Aside from such concerns, it is apparent that Sweden is becoming worried
that it will be unable to complete its negotiations by the EU deadline of
March 1, endangering the whole accession timetable.
Mr Ulf Dinkelspiel, minister for European affairs and foreign trade, was
irked by the sluggish pace of talks when he spoke to journalists recently,
saying that difficulties over snuff and free trade agreements with the
Baltics should already have been resolved. He was looking for substantial
progress ahead of a EU ministerial meeting scheduled for today. Even if such
progress is made, the timetable is tight. Several important questions have
still to be discussed including agriculture, regional policy and budget
contributions - and they could all prove difficult.
The big unresolved question is when exactly Sweden will hold its referendum
on the EU. Three alternatives have been canvassed by the government: next
June, three months after the negotiations should have been concluded and
before the summer holidays; next September on the same day as the general
election; or during the autumn. All three choices have their drawbacks. The
Social Democrats, who may well form the next government, clearly disfavour
June or September, and in any case it will be difficult to swing opinion in
favour of membership before then. By waiting until next autumn, however,
momentum will be lost and the newly-elected government will almost certainly
be preoccupied with internal and domestic matters.
The Social Democrats, who actually lodged the Swedish application back in
1991, are commonly seen as the key to a Swedish EU entry on the grounds that
without their active campaigning there is little chance of the country being
won over. A comparison is made with Denmark, which only voted in favour of
Maastricht at the second attempt after a change of government which brought
the Social Democrats to power.
The trouble is that the Swedish Social Democrats are deeply split over the
EU and they have certainly not mobilised the party faithful to promote a Yes
vote so far. On the contrary, the party has preferred to lie low, awaiting
the outcome of the negotiations. Whether Sweden does eventually join the EU
will depend very much on the line the Social Democrats adopt once the result
of those discussions is known.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Survey of Sweden (8): Bridge still awaits go-ahead - Link
with Denmark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When PLM, the Swedish international packaging group with its headquarters in
Malmo, calls together managers from its 13 European plants, they usually
meet in Copenhagen, on the Danish side of the narrow straits which separates
Sweden from Denmark at the entrance to the Baltic.
The managers fly into Copenhagen's Kastrup international airport, but to get
from there to Malmo by hovercraft connection - which the weather sometimes
prevents - adds about 90 minutes to the journey, allowing for waiting time,
says Mr Per Erlandsson, head of corporate communications. For this reason
alone, PLM, like most of the companies in southern Sweden, will welcome the
day when the planned road-and-rail bridge across the Oresund is completed,
cutting travel time between Kastrup and Malmo to about 30 minutes.
Sweden and Denmark have signed a treaty by which the two states are
committed to building the bridge and the governments have set up a joint
consortium, Oresundskonsortiet, to plan, finance and act as main contractor
for the project. It will cost about DKr19bn, including the on-land
investments on the Danish and Swedish sides of the link. Construction should
begin in 1994, although political obstacles to the final decision to go
ahead have yet to be resolved.
Sweden's Centre Party, headed by Mr Olaf Johansson, minister for the
environment, is opposed to the bridge, for environmental reasons.
If the government decides to give the go-ahead to construction - Mr Carl
Bildt, the prime minister, has said that he hopes the decision can be taken
before the end of the year - there will be pressure from the party
organisation for the Centre Party to withdraw from the government.
Perhaps it is not entirely coincidental that the Centre Party is the Swedish
party which is least enthusiastic - although not completely set against -
Sweden's membership of the European Union. For, as Mr Erlandsson says, the
bridge also has an important symbolic value: 'It will show that Sweden wants
to get closer to Europe.'
Geographers on both sides of the Oresund, meanwhile, are in little doubt
that the bridge will be of enormous significance for southern Sweden and the
Copenhagen area.
'The bridge will, without question, revitalise industry and the regional
workforce' in Scania (the province of southern Sweden) and Sjflland (the
large Danish island on which Copenhagen is sited), wrote* Professor Lars
Nordstrom, transport economist from Chlamers Technical University,
Gothenburg.
Musing over the controversies which surround the bridge at present, he
suggested that in the long term the bridge would bind Malmo and Copenhagen
together so closely that it would appear odd that the bridge once did not
exist. And if something should happen to the bridge, it would be regarded by
future generations as a catastrophe.
As things stand, Copenhagen and Malmo might as well be hundreds of
kilometres from each other, not just the 18km which in fact is all that
separates them, says Professor Christian Wichmann Mathiessen of Copenhagen
University, a Danish geographer who is one of the more visionary enthusiasts
of the bridge.
The city regions on either side of the sound are 'completely separate
systems', he says, pointing to surveys which suggest that for every personal
contact between residents on the two sides of the sound there are 16
contacts between residents of southern Sweden and Stockholm.
The Oresund, according to Professor Mathiessen, is one of the world's great
traffic junctions: the land traffic junction between Sweden and continental
Europe; an important shipping lane; and the site of one of northern Europe's
largest airports, Kastrup.
Within a radius of 50km of Kastrup there is a population of 2.3m people,
making it the 20th-largest city region in Europe. Copenhagen - the
population of the greater Copenhagen area is about 1.3m - ranks as the
32nd-largest and Malmo - population 235,000 - is 140th. In terms of
purchasing power, the Oresund region ranks as eighth in Europe.
The region is already an important area for scientific research, but could
become even more so if the scientific communities on the two sides of the
sound were to become more integrated. In terms of research capacity,
Copenhagen ranks 12th in Europe; Malmo and the university town of Lund rank
30th. Together, the region ranks fourth or fifth in Europe for its research
capacity.
On the Swedish side, Astra, the pharmaceuticals giant, Gambro,
medical-technical products, Tetra Pak Alfa Laval, food industry machinery,
and Kockums, the shipyard specialising in submarines, are among the
companies which give Malmo and Lund a high-technology profile.
Once the bridge is built, the separate systems will begin to change. 'The
sound area will rapidly shift from the old balance situation with two
separate systems which both function well, into a system with a new balance,
characterised by new movements of people, merchandise, services,
information, energy and money,' says Professor Mathiessen. But it will not
happen on its own. 'It all depends on local mobilisation. The future market
should be shining bright for the population, politicians and administrators
and business leaders. What is needed is action, local action.'
In Malmo they agree. 'The bridge alone won't do it,' says Mr Dag Fagring,
city promotion manager, although the bridge will help by focusing attention
on the city. He has just put forward a SKr6m promotion programme, Advantage
Malmo, to try to persuade business, Swedish as well as international, that
Malmo is a good place to be, and, with the bridge in prospect, getting
better all the time.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Survey of Sweden (5): Membership still growing - Labour and
the trade unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR

<TEXT>
The forced resignation of Mr Stig Malm as head of Sweden's LO blue-collar
union federation earlier this month - for his sanctioning of 'golden
parachute' pay-off deals for failed executives in union-dominated companies
 -has thrown a harsh light on the inner machinations of what remains one of
the strongest trade union movements in the world.
The scandal was only the last of many involving Mr Malm during his 11 years
as LO leader and his departure was met with barely concealed sighs of relief
from Sweden's labour establishment who believed he had grown into a serious
liability.
Previously, Mr Malm had been able to ride out the storms by mobilising
support behind himself but this time he found no sympathisers among the rank
and file. LO's headquarters was inundated with letters, fax messages and
phone calls calling for his dismissal.
Mr Malm, already a figure of fun, lost all credibility with the exposure of
the enormous gap that exists between the harsh shopfloor realities and the
lavish, cushioned world of the nomenklatura.
Now the LO executive is looking for his successor and the choice will be put
to a special meeting of the LO on February 2 for approval.
The Malm affair is unique in Swedish labour history. His predecessors at the
LO were sober, modest men of power, vision and responsibility who combined
idealism with administrative competence. They built the movement into one of
the most respected and influential in the industrialised world.
Union leaders wonder whether they can restore the LO to its former pivotal
role and they are taking the opportunity presented by Mr Malm's abrupt
departure to re-examine the role of organised labour in Sweden and plans its
reform.
At first sight, the Swedish unions look in reasonable shape. despite the
return of mass unemployment, deindustrialisation, and the waning of the old
centralised corporatism that made the LO almost an arm of government. Union
membership is actually going up at the moment. It rose from 82 per cent to
86 per cent of the employed workforce in the past six years. Compare this
with today's official figures of less than 33 per cent in the UK; 34 per
cent in Germany; 15 per cent in the US and a mere 8 per cent in France.
The huge size of Sweden's organised workforce suggests no social stigma is
attached to belonging to a union. Nor is there any hostility to trade
unionism among the country's white-collar salariat, with 83 per cent of them
organised. Indeed, the overwhelming majority of Swedes regard union
membership as a necessary protection at a time of labour market crisis.
The reason for this is understandable. The Swedish unions do not only try to
provide strong job security for their members in work but they continue to
administer the unemployment insurance benefit system as they have done since
1935.
Commentators believe that if the unions were ever to lose their key role in
the welfare state, their membership would tumble to 50-60 per cent of the
employed labour force; the norm in other Scandinavian countries.
But other factors in Sweden are perhaps just as important. First and
foremost, the country's employers remain strong supporters of workplace
trade unionism. While some dislike the political role the unions like to
play in national life, they see the value of having unions in their own
plants. During the current deep and long recession in Sweden, companies such
as Asea Brown-Boveri, Saab, SKF and Atlas Copco have carried through
sweeping programmes of workplace rationalisation. Job losses have been heavy
but workers and unions have co-operated in the introduction of lean
production methods, multi-skilled teams and time-based manufacturing systems
aimed at improving cost competitiveness.
After a prolonged period of stagnation, the growth in Swedish manufacturing
productivity is now the highest in the industrialised world. Employers
recognise these radical changes would have been much harder to achieve if
they had not enjoyed the whole-hearted support of the unions.
In fact, Sweden's unions have a long tradition of accepting technological
change. Innovative, not reactive, they have developed internal structures
flexible enough to enable them to turn the demands made on them by capital
to their own advantage.
Such adaptability has made it easier for the Swedish unions to reassess
parts of the old model that have grown obsolete. Support for centralised,
solidaristic wage bargaining where workers were paid the same level of wages
for the same kind of work has waned. There is also much less enthusiasm
among the rank and file for retaining close links between the unions and the
Social Democratic party
The most significant change in collective bargaining this year has been the
joint two-year agreement for the first time in the engineering industry that
has united the white-collar unions SIF and CF with the metalworkers' union .
Such single-table bargaining is likely to spread to other sectors and it may
lead to an eventual merger between the LO and the TCO white-collar union
federation, particularly as the LO has all but abandoned its old role as
central wage bargainer or even pay co-ordinator.
There are clear signs of a new consensus emerging in the workplace between
capital and labour. Mr Heinrich Blauert, head of VF the engineering
employers body, points out: 'In the new agreement, the role of co-operative
groups is even more important. This is a step in the right direction.' By
enhancing the position of company-based union negotiators in the bargaining
process, the employers believe they can establish a more effective basis for
keeping down costs.
Four joint employer-union working parties are examining the future of
Swedish engineering. 'Our approach is low-key,' says Mr Blauert. 'In a
peaceful way we are moving to a position where our member companies have the
room for manoeuvre in reaching the kind of wage settlements which they
want.' There is a more conciliatory tone nowadays among Sweden's employers.
The neo-liberal rhetoric of SAF, their main national organisation, is less
in evidence. Only limited moves have been made to deregulate the Swedish
labour market and rolling back union power remains little more than an
aspiration on the far right.
A new generation of young union leaders and employers is starting to emerge.
They are keen to find a new way of working together. This will not mean any
cosy return to the certainties of the old Swedish model. But nor is the
country about to see a marginalising of organised labour.
In fact, Sweden may turn out to be an example of how organised labour can
still have a positive role to play in an open market economy. By accepting
the global realities of Sweden's manufacturing companies and embracing new
forms of work organisation, the Swedish trade unions may escape the steep
decline suffered by trade unions elsewhere.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Survey of Sweden (6): Pension system is a time bomb -
Welfare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden's huge welfare state - built up during the booming years of the 1950s
and 1960s - is under enormous strain.
The demands of people on the social security system based on universalist
principles of provision have grown dramatically in recent years while
economic growth has stagnated.
More than 60 per cent of Sweden's gross domestic product is accounted for by
the needs of the public sector,the highest proportion of any country in the
world and a substantial part of it is accounted for by social expenditure
after debt repayments.
Swedes have been talking about the cost 'crisis' of their welfare state for
nearly 10 years. It was in 1986 that the LO blue-collar union federation
pronounced at its congress that public expenditure should not grow any
higher as a percentage of gross domestic product in order to meet the needs
of the citizen.
The ruling Social Democrats at the time said they were determined to improve
the productive efficiency of the existing welfare system. There was a new
emphasis on consumer choice to break down the rigidities of state services
that were over-bureaucratic.
Some market-oriented Social Democrats began to argue that society and the
state were no longer synonymous and people should be encouraged to take more
responsibility for their own well-being.
But their commitment to reform was still tempered by a desire to uphold the
principle of equality of access for all to the welfare state through
universalistic programmes.
However, the twin pressures of rising consumer demands on increasingly
limited resources and accelerating costs in a stagnant economy forced more
radical discussion across the political spectrum by the early 1990s.
An attack by Sweden's vociferous band of neo-liberals has made little
progress among the policy makers. Even inside the ruling Moderate party,
social conservatives seem to be much more influential than their economic
liberally minded colleagues when it comes to discussions on the welfare
state.
Mr Bengt Westerberg, minister of social affairs and leader of the Liberal
party, remains an eloquent champion of the verities of the Swedish system
and it is hard to see any frontal assault against the welfare state
succeeding with him in the cabinet.
The two other parties in the coalition government - the Centre and the
Christian Democrats - are strong believers in the Swedish way of social
provision. Security and caring remain key words in the language of
contemporary Swedish politics.
Any political leader who campaigned to tear down the existing system in the
name of individual freedom would suffer severe defeat at the polls.
But this does not mean that a drastic shake-up will not come in the very
near future to public services that used to be the envy of the world.
The return of mass unemployment to Sweden has brought a new and added cost
burden to the welfare state that seems likely to grow over the next few
years adding to the size of the public sector deficit.
Over the past three years successive governments have been forced by the
demands of the global economy to trim around the edges of welfare spending.
There have been cuts in sickness benefit entitlements, for example, despite
often stiff domestic resistance from the powerful public sector interest
groups. More fundamental reforms are also being planned, especially for the
provision of health care.
In September last year, agreement was reached in principle between all the
main political parties in a crisis package designed to defend the fixed
exchange rate of the krona to take both sickness and work injury insurance
out of the state budget and put its funding and administration in the hands
of the social partners-employers and unions.
It was suggested this move could come from the mid-1990s but the
implications of such a radical change remain unclear.
Many conservatives believe this would pave the way for the rapid growth of
private insurance schemes to replace the state system. Social Democrats see
the move as a sensible way of providing a new and enhanced role for the
trade unions. The future of the pension system is a time bomb ticking away
at the heart of the Swedish welfare state as Swedes grow older and the
existing means of financing pensions becomes increasingly difficult to
sustain.
The scope for more private and occupational pension schemes seems likely to
grow as the state provision fails to ensure the country's pensioners
maintain a reasonable standard of living.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Survey of Sweden (2): Recession appears to be ending - The
economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The longest and deepest recession Sweden has suffered since before the
Second World War appears, at last, to be ending. 'The signs that we see seem
to indicate that the recovery is there - and slightly better than we
thought. It is time we had some good news,' said Mrs Anne Wibble, the
finance minister who has had the unenviable task of steering the economy
through the hard times.
The upturn will not show up in this year's overall growth figure. The
government's estimate for 1993 is that gross domestic product has contracted
by 2.8 per cent, much sharper than the successive retreats of 1.7 per cent
in each of 1991 and 1992. But the trends show that the economy hit bottom
around mid-year and has since been edging upwards.
Industrial production, fuelled by a resurgence of export growth, has risen
this year by approaching 2 per cent after a fall of 3 per cent last year. In
1994, the government predicts gross domestic product growth of 2 per cent.
The scars of recession, however, will take much longer to heal and, with an
election looming next September, the political debate over the appropriate
structure for Sweden's economy for the remainder of the century is
sharpening.
As the country moves tentatively out of recession it is carrying some heavy
burdens. The budget deficit stands at more than 13 per cent of GDP and is
set to rise higher - to an estimated 15 per cent of GDP in the 1993-94
budget year. This has pushed up central government debt from about SKr600bn
in 1990 to more than SKr1,000bn, or about 70 per cent of GDP, inevitably
stacking up a heavy repayment schedule for the future.
Above all, the recession has seen a leap in unemployment unprecedented in
Sweden, which until the late 1980s saw itself as having created the elusive
formula of combining a strong welfare state with virtual full employment. In
1989, 'open' unemployment - excluding those on government training schemes -
stood at less than 2 per cent of the workforce. Today, open unemployment is
more than 8.5 per cent, with a further 5 per cent of the workforce on
training schemes.
In confronting what to do about unemployment, policymakers face a striking
contrast between the external and internal sectors.
What growth has been rekindled in the economy has come largely from export
industries which have benefited hugely from the 25 per cent fall in the
value of the Swedish krona that followed the flotation of the currency in
November 1992. Exports are set to rise 6 per cent this year and a further 9
per cent next year, moving the current account balance into surplus.
But the domestic economy, the engine of significant employment creation, has
remained mired in recession. Government curbs on the public sector have been
partly responsible. The centre-right coalition has taken SKr77bn out of the
budget over the past two years and plans to extract a further SKr80bn over
the next four years, mostly through lower public spending.
However, a dramatic shift in savings patterns by the public has also had a
profound effect. The removal of generous tax breaks on debt interest,
collapsing house prices, rising unemployment and general uncertainty about
future prosperity have provoked a wave of debt consolidation and saving. The
household sector savings ratio has swung from minus 5 per cent to plus 11
per cent of income in just a few years.
The result has been a sharp contraction of private consumption, by 2 per
cent in 1992 and more than 5 per cent this year. This is significant because
private consumption makes up 55 per cent of GDP.
Mrs Wibble hopes there will be a small recovery in private consumption next
year, fuelled by interest rates that have fallen to about 5 per cent. But
the best most economists expect is about 1 per cent growth. On top of that
outlook, net investment in the economy is still falling - by 10 per cent
this year - and is not expected to recover until 1995.
The gloomy state of the domestic economy has prompted the opposition Social
Democratic party to insist that there must be a stimulus to demand to help
generate growth, suggesting cuts in VAT and delays in increases in other
indirect taxes.
'We fear that domestic demand will not lift the economy next year,' says Mr
Goran Persson, the Social Democratic shadow finance minister. 'We think for
1994 we need to stimulate the economy. If we don't there is a danger of a
downward spiral to depression.'
Mrs Wibble and the centre-right government are anxious to lower taxes as
part of their commitment to a market-driven economy. This year, they have
made room for removing tax on dividends. But for now, Mrs Wibble says,
reducing the budget deficit must have priority.
'We are not going to introduce any fiscal stimulus because it would have the
opposite effect,' she says. 'The strategy is to keep on with fiscal
consolidation as planned and to make it possible to keep on with the
stimulus from monetary policy. That will be much more effective.'
The political conflict over economic policy has been ill-received in the
markets, contributing to the weakness of the krona. Until earlier this year,
the Social Democrats had co-operated with the government. There was broad
political acceptance of a benchmark study of the economy produced by a
commission led by Professor Assar Lindbeck which made no less than 113
recommendations in general aimed at liberalisation and reducing the state's
role in the economy.
The Social Democrats continue to accept that the public sector, which in
1992 amounted to 70 per cent of GDP, had become too large to sustain.
Mr Persson says a Social Democratic government would continue the battle
against the deficit and seek to promote private industrial growth. But he
opposes the government's belief that the frontiers of the state should be
rolled much further back, as soon as the state of the public finances allow,
through greater tax reform and more private involvement, for example in the
service sector.
The Social Democratic commitment is to get the deficit in check so that they
can bolster, not reduce, the welfare state. 'There are areas that should not
be deregulated - which the market cannot handle,' Mr Persson says. 'Our
policy relies on having strong public finances because without strong public
finances you cannot have a strong welfare state.'

FT  21 DEC 93 / Survey of Sweden (4): Time to tighten belts - Unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rapid return of mass unemployment to Sweden over the past three years
has come as a profound shock to a country that has not known lengthy dole
queues since the Great Depression of the early 1930s.
Last month, 357,000 Swedes were registered without a job; some 8.4 per cent
of the workforce. Total employment has dropped by as much as 9 per cent
since the start of the recession at the end of 1990.
All the forecasts - both official and independent - suggest it will be at
least the second half of next year before the jobless total stops growing.
But there is no prospect of any radical improvement in labour market
conditions for the foreseeable future.
However, the country's comprehensive and well-funded labour market
programmes of training and placement are expected to keep the actual level
of open unemployment down below the European Union average. Last month, as
many as 220,000 Swedes were covered by those measures; 5.1 per cent of the
workforce. The government's existing plans provide for a total of 400,000
people being offered a job or training and education in the current
financial year.
The Swedish Labour Market Board, in its recently published forecasts for the
rest of the century, suggests the combined total number of unemployed and
those on a labour market scheme will still amount to more than 11 per cent
of the workforce.
Such a grim outlook is regarded as unacceptable to many Swedes. Even during
the recessions of the mid-1970s and early 1980s, the country was able to
avoid soaring unemployment unlike much of the rest of the western
industrialised world.
However, Sweden's policy-makers accept privately that it will be very
difficult to restore 'full' employment. 'Work for all' used to be the
inspiring slogan that successive Swedish governments carried out in
practice. But not even the most committed of Social Democrats can really
guarantee delivering such an objective.
Mr Bildt's government insists that 'In the long term there is no other way
to increase employment in Sweden than by pursuing a policy which helps to
strengthen and maintain the country in a competitive position and
sustainable low inflation and thus lower interest rates'.
Ministers rule out monetary and fiscal expansion to cut unemployment.
Instead, they emphasise the need for structural changes in the labour market
by making it easier for employers to hire and fire; the removal of rules and
regulations that they see as obstacles to job creation; and moderation in
wage demands.
Few in Sweden believe the country can reverse the current spiralling trend
of joblessness on its own and there is a widespread acceptance that its
employment prospects depend on the development of a wider European strategy.
Mr Allan Larsson, the former Social Democratic finance minister, presented
an interesting commissioned paper on employment earlier this month in
Brussels that won the approval of all the European Social Democrats,
including the British Labour party.
In flavour and substance it is not far removed from the policy document
presented by Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, at this
month's EU summit. The emphasis is on the need to combine competitiveness
with solidarity.
In the past, Sweden's Social Democrats used the country's public sector as
the main engine for job creation. But Mr Larsson's document rules out any
further expansion there. Instead, the emphasis is on creating economic
conditions which will enable medium and small-sized private entrepreneurs to
hire workers while training and vocational training are given a prominent
place in the jobs strategy.
Mr Larsson's approach calls for 'a strategy of investment-led growth' as
'the only fair and sustainable route to sound public finances'.
It seems unlikely - unless there is a dramatic surge to the left in the
German federal elections next December - that Mr Larsson's strategy will be
practised by EU member state governments. But it may be used by the
left-wing parties in next June's European parliamentary elections and
provide the basis for his own party's economic programme in office if they
win next September's Swedish general election.
The Labour Market Board is not being starved of funds to administer measures
to keep a substantial number of people out of the unemployment figures.
These measures include some imaginative ideas targeted on workers without a
job for three months or longer - such as recruitment subsidies for employers
to employ them; educational leave replacement; working life development
enabling workers to leave their jobs for a period to be replaced by the
jobless; relief work as well as workplace introduction; and youth training
schemes to help the 18- to 25-year-olds.
But the labour market programmes cannot provide opportunities for all the
unemployed. Increasingly, financial resources are being deployed - as a
proportion of total spending - into income maintenance for the unemployed
and not to labour market measures. Last year, SKr24.07bn was spent on
benefit payments to the unemployed and this year the figure will climb to
more than SKr50bn.
The present government has reduced the maximum benefit available to the
jobless from 90 per cent to 80 per cent of previous earnings to a level of
SKr564 a day for a maximum of 300 days.
The unemployed have to be gainfully employed for at least 75 days over a
12-month period to qualify for the insurance benefit. Since September, they
have had to wait five days before the benefit is paid and the benefit can be
terminated if a worker refuses 'suitable work' or behaves in an anti-social
way that contributes to them not being employed.
The Swedish government has aroused opposition in the labour movement with
its proposal to reform the existing unemployment insurance system with the
introduction of a payroll tax of 1 per cent from January and 2 per cent in
1995 to help fund it.
The government also wants to introduce a voluntary insurance scheme which
would supplement or run in parallel with the existing system but this is
seen as an attempt to weaken trade union involvement in the administration
of the benefit. What all sides have yet to accept is that the soaring cost
of unemployment is adding to Sweden's mounting budget deficit. The
unemployment insurance fund is well into debt at more than SKr50bn and the
state is having to borrow on the money markets at competitive interest rates
to sustain the present levels of employment benefit.
It is hard to see how this can continue indefinitely. Like it or not, Sweden
is going to have to tighten its belt and accept that its still relatively
generous approach to dealing with unemployment will have to change. This
will prove a severe test, however, for the strong social consensus that has
lasted for more than 50 years.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Survey of Sweden (1): Year of opportunities ahead - Next
September, Swedes will vote in a general election. Some time in 1994 they
will also decide whether or not to join the European Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY

<TEXT>
Sweden, a country once so confident of its destiny, is facing a new year
full of challenges and choices.
After three years of recession, in which the economy has shrunk by more than
5 per cent, a return to modest growth seems likely in 1994. But the pace of
recovery and, above all, a reversal of unemployment now running at about 14
per cent of the workforce, will depend greatly on the extent to which there
is a rekindling of confidence in the still slumbering domestic economy.
In September next year, Swedes will vote in a general election. They will
select either the vigorous market reform policies of prime minister Carl
Bildt's right-centre coalition or a return to the leadership of the Social
Democratic Party, with its commitment to preserve the essentials of the
welfare state it constructed over the past 30 years.
During the course of 1994, Sweden will also decide whether or not it should
join the European Union. Negotiations on accession are scheduled to be
completed by March 1. If the timetable is stuck to, the issue will be put to
a referendum by the end of next year.
As 1993 draws to a close, the pointers do not look, at first sight, very
encouraging for Mr Bildt and his conservative Moderate party. Opinion polls
have given the Social Democrats more than 50 per cent support. They also
show a persistent hostility towards joining the EU, despite support for
membership from the leading government and opposition parties.
Other issues have been interpreted as showing that Swedes are not responding
to Mr Bildt's impassioned call for a reformed Sweden to become a full and
enthusiastic participant in the development of a more integrated Europe.
Early this month, the senior management and shareholders of Volvo, the
country's biggest and best-loved manufacturer, staged an unprecedented
rebellion against a plan to merge the company's car and truck operations
with state-owned Renault of France. The main opposition was concerned with
the structure of the deal - but it also attracted an emotional objection to
a foreign takeover that bodes ill for those campaigning for EU membership.
Sweden's environmentalists, with the support of the coalition-member Centre
Party and apparently many voters, are meanwhile trying to block plans agreed
with Denmark to build a road and rail bridge from the southern city of
Malmo, across the narrow Oresund, to Copenhagen.
Mr Bildt, however, gives no impression of being down-hearted. He believes
that there is a broad acceptance in Sweden of policies designed to cut back
the role of the state in the economy, despite the pain of recession.
Confident of a 'robust recovery' over the next two years, Mr Bildt says
conditions in the economy will be improving perceptibly by the time the
election is held, sufficient to ensure another non-socialist majority in the
Riksdag (parliament). Then, the intention is to build on the steps already
taken to reduce public spending - through measures such as cuts in
unemployment and sickness benefits - and to open up the state-dominated
service sector to private business. The public sector in Sweden still
accounts for close to 70 per cent of gross domestic product.
'What remains is to bring down the overall level of taxation - in terms of
social costs and VAT,' says Mr Bildt. 'Public consumption is going down
faster than expected, but of course much remains to be done, particularly in
the public health sector. On the budget deficit, a robust recovery is going
to do quite a lot, but not enough.'
The prime minister admits, however, that he is concerned about the appetite
for more liberalisation among an electorate which long ago grew accustomed
to the generous levels of state welfare afforded by the 'Swedish model'. 'I
am afraid that when the economy starts to do better, a lot of people are
going to ask 'Well, do you need these policies of reform any longer?'' he
says.
This is what the Social Democrats are out to exploit. The party is by no
means advocating a complete return to the policies of the past. It
acknowledges that the balance between public and private sector in Sweden
became unsustainable. It was the Social Democrats who, when last in office,
launched reforms to cut the country's previously huge income tax burden.
But, under the leadership of former prime minister Ingvar Carlsson, the
Social Democrats are firmly committed to retaining the essentials of the
welfare state. The party emphasises the need to foster private sector
industrial growth but opposes steps taken by the present government such as
the abolition of taxes on dividends.
'I don't think the problem is the public sector,' says Mr Carlsson. 'Really
the problem today is that we have such low demand. You can say that it is
because there is such insecurity in the public sector - people don't know
what will happen to their state pensions, or what will happen when they are
unemployed - that people now save much more. One of the best stimulations of
the economy today would be if we create some kind of clarification about the
social securities.'
The intensifying election battle has considerably complicated the issue of
Sweden's application to join the European Union. Although it was the Social
Democrats who, in a break with traditional party policies, lodged the
application in 1991, there are deep divisions in approach to the question
between the opposition and Mr Bildt.
The Moderates see membership as essential for Sweden's future economic
prosperity, but they also see it as a means to shift Sweden decisively away
from its previously aloof strategic stance. In the post-cold war world, they
want to place Sweden at the centre of the EU's political, economic and
strategic development.
Mr Bildt says the logic of Swedish neutrality 'has gone' and instead Sweden
should help bring a 'northern perspective' to the development of western
Europe's strategic and defence policy.
The Social Democrats, meanwhile, are deeply split over EU membership. A
majority of their supporters oppose joining, not least because many are
still strongly attached to neutrality. The thrust of Mr Carlsson's advocacy
of membership concentrates on the perceived benefits Sweden could gain from
wider policy co-operation in the fight against unemployment.
With opinion polls showing support for membership at little more than 25 per
cent, and opposition around 45 per cent, it is clear to all sides that
winning approval for membership in the promised referendum will require
changing opinion within the Social Democrats.
This makes choosing a date for the referendum extremely difficult. Assuming
the negotiations on an accession agreement are completed, the government
would ideally favour a vote in June, or simultaneously with the general
election. But the Social Democratic leadership does not want to have to try
to persuade a sceptical party to support a 'Yes' campaign at the same as it
is fighting an election.
Mr Carlsson wants to wait until after the election. 'We must prove to the
people that we can solve their daily problems better inside the EU than
outside. That takes time and if we lose this referendum it will take 10 or
20 years before it can be brought up again,' he says.
Mr Bildt fears, however, that the 'No' campaign, led mainly at present by
marginal left-wing and environmental groups, will gain in strength the
longer it has to organise. It is one of the circles he must try to square in
1994.

FT  21 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Stores mixed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was mixed reaction among stores stocks to reports that pre-Christmas
trading had picked up in recent days. Most of the leaders continued their
recent dull form, undermined by what many in the market consider a bout of
overbuying in the wake of the Budget, as well as by cautious reports from
suppliers, particularly in textiles.
Marks and Spencer shaded a half-penny to 430p, Kingfisher and Dixons managed
rises of 2 to 719p and 271p respectively, and Great Universal Stores
remained at 605p. Boots, performing better, added 7 at 557p and WH Smith 'A'
put on 9 at 526p.
However, second liners responded more positively to the reports, with Austin
Reed climbing 13 to 172p, Allders 6 to 198p and Argos 5 to 381p.
Signet Group, formerly known as Ratners, and one of the worst affected
stocks of the recent rash of bearish stories on sales, gained 20 per cent as
two institutions were reported big buyers of the convertible preference
shares. They finished 2 up at 41 1/4 p, with the ordinary eventually 4 1/4
ahead at 24 1/2 p after a hefty 8m traded.
News that an international industry conference aimed at cutting back
ethylene production had been abandoned sent ICI down against a bullish
London market. ICI is a big producer of the chemical and its shares fell 34
to 734p at one stage but rallied to end 14 off at 753 1/2 p on 3.7m dealt.
Hoare Govett, a long-time seller of ICI, reiterated its bearish stance and
reinforced its bottom of the range 1994 profits forecast of Pounds 350m.
Some dealers expected investors to adjust chemicals sector weightings by
switching into companies such as BOC, Courtaulds and Laporte. But the sector
remained churlishly unresponsive - BOC gained 5 at 645p, Laporte 2 at 718p
and Courtaulds only a penny at 470p.
Schroders, one of the two merchant banks in the FT-SE 100 Index, jumped 22
to a peak 1360p, albeit in painfully thin turnover of 113,000 shares. SG
Warburg, also in the FT-SE 100, raced up 16 to 914p, while Kleinwort Benson
advanced 8 to 561p and Hambros 6 to 387p.
Prudential stood out in insurances, touching 360p before closing a net 11
1/2 higher at 359p, with the market responding to suggestions that one of
the big German pension funds was seeking to buy a block of 2.5m shares.
The British Petroleum buy story gathered momentum, with domestic and
overseas institutions continuing to chase the shares higher after last
week's highly successful UK and US presentations delivered to the big
institutions by Mr David Simon, BP's chief executive. At those meetings Mr
Simon said BP was on track to attain the Dollars 2bn profits target he set
for end-1994 and he increased this to Dollars 3bn as a projection for
end-1995.
At the close, BP was 9 stronger at 357p, having touched a three-year high of
358 1/2 p in midsession, and many oil sector specialists expect the shares
to launch a determined challenge to the all-time high of just above 377p
reached in July 1987. Turnover was a hefty 10m shares.
BP's performance was all the more impressive given a background of
continuing uncertainty in crude oil markets, where Brent crude remained
steadfastly below the Dollars 14 a barrel mark.
Shell also came in for good support, closing 6 higher at 718p after 4.8m
traded.
Another purchase in the ice cream industry by Unilever, which paid Pounds
220m for a majority holding in a French manufacturer, helped the shares
climb 15 to 1187p.
Takeover fever in the television sector faded somewhat and Yorkshire-Tyne
Tees Television fell 7 to 151p in reaction to a press report that LWT
Holdings had ruled out a bid for the company. LWT rose 6 to 605p. By the
close of trading yesterday the Granada all-paper offer for LWT was worth
632p per share as Granada ended 7 up at 527p.
Bid talk returned to haunt troubled Fisons, whose shares recovered 3 to
115p.

FT  21 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Renewed bid talk in TSB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TSB delivered the best performance among high street banks as the market
responded strongly to whispers that it could be a takeover target for a
domestic or overseas bank seeking to establish or increase a presence in UK
retail banking.
The stock matched a generally strong showing by bank shares from January to
July this year, but faltered during the summer months and substantially
lagged behind until recently. Yesterday the shares powered ahead to reach an
all-time high of 259p before coming off the best level to finish a net 7 up
at 257p.
Dealers noted persistent strong demand via the inter-dealer broker system,
where TSB was said to have remained well bid all day. The level of activity
in the shares - 3.8m changed hands yesterday - tended to put some traders
off the bid story, but others remained convinced that TSB was a genuine
takeover target.
The bank's shares were up and running from the outset yesterday as the
market absorbed weekend press reports that the for sale sign had been taken
off its Hill Samuel subsidiary - confirmed in a statement late yesterday
from TSB - and that TSB was probably much happier with a recent improved
performance from its merchant bank division.
However, the takeover speculation, which has surrounded TSB since it lost
its way following the disastrous purchase of Hill Samuel for Pounds 777m
just after the great crash of October 1987 and its acquisition of the Target
unit trust group, began to circulate again, pushing TSB shares forward.
Stories yesterday suggested that Standard Chartered had taken a hard look at
TSB, as had National Bank of Australia. The Standard story was quickly shot
down by sources close to the bank. 'Standard has no aspirations to get
involved in retail banking in the UK, it is not interested in excursions in
such an area; it is much more interested in playing to its strengths across
the world,' said one close observer. Standard Chartered shares hardened 4 to
1194p.
One leading banks analyst described TSB as 'among the most compelling
takeover targets in the UK, it is still a capital rich bank', and said a bid
could be 'a disguised rights issue'. He played down the National Bank
rumours, however, saying that TSB has a strong northern bias and that NBA
had acquired its interests in the North via its purchase of Yorkshire Bank.

FT  21 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Futures buying drives Footsie to
all-time high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures returned to the forefront of the UK stock markets
yesterday afternoon, and once again led the FT-SE 100 Index to a new closing
peak. As the March contract on the Footsie broke through 3,400, the stock
market turned higher in its wake, with private investors leading the way.
London was encouraged by renewed strength in other European bourses and by
predictions that outflows from Japanese markets will be targeted at the UK
market.
At best, the FT-SE 100 was nearly 32 points up at 3,369, but share prices
reacted quickly when the March contract slipped back from its best levels.
The final reading put the index at 3,364.9 for an advance of 27.8 on the
day. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index closed 18.7 ahead at 3,710.4, also a new peak
and only a shade below its best level of the session. The Mid 250 Index,
which extends the Footsie 100-share range across the second line stocks, has
recovered rapidly from profit-taking in early November.
Trading volume in the market's top 100 stocks was moderate for most of the
day, but increased sharply when the surge in the futures contract opened the
way for arbitrage trading, in which the leading securities houses sell the
futures contract and buy the underlying stocks.
However, Seaq volume dipped to 748.9m shares after Friday's near record
1.0156bn. Non-Footsie business increased to around 65 per cent of the day's
total; business in second line stocks usually averages less than 58 per cent
of daily totals.
Stock Exchange statistics disclosed that retail, or customer, business on
Friday reached 1.84bn, making a total for the week of Pounds 8.4bn, one of
the highest weekly figures for what has been an extremely active year on the
London stock market.
Traders warned that the early part of yesterday's session saw mostly two-way
business in the leading stocks. A genuine programme trade moved through the
market without incident, to be followed later by several trades which were
identified as basket trades, linked to futures trading.
Some US investment business was seen in London but strategists remained
cautious, warning that the final trading sessions of 1993 could well bring
profit-taking now that the big institutions are beginning to close their
books for the year. Many houses were prepared to be bearish at first, and an
early gain of 16 points on the Footsie was almost eliminated later. 'But for
the future, it would have been a quiet day,' said the head dealer at an
international trading house.
The appearance, in strength, of the private UK investors was no great
surprise. The annual Christmas flow of brokerage recommendations is likely
to increase this year and highly bullish profiles of the market will target
private investors.
Marketmaking houses have taken steps to meet the stock shortages provoked by
the enormous upturn in futures markets and were buying stock yesterday
morning to meet the expected Christmas rush.
Once again, it was the merchant banking and allied sectors, prime
beneficiaries of active securities markets, which stood out yesterday.
Utility stocks also responded again to dividend optimism. But the consumer
sectors, looking anxiously for signs of Christmas spending success, were
less confident; while brewers and hotels did well, the main line store
sector continued to lag the market.

FT  21 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest futures contract on the FT-SE 100 Index generated the same
enthusiasm as its predecessor and pushed the underlying stock market to new
highs, writes Peter John.
The new contract, which expires in March, has replaced the December contract
that ended its life on Friday as the most heavily traded futures instrument
linked to the Footsie.
It has a fair value premium calculated at between 14 and 18 points above the
cash market, but after opening at 3,367 it steamed forward to hit a high of
3,403 in the afternoon. At those rarified levels it was trading some 35
points above cash.
Dealers are beginning to worry that the stock market is at a frighteningly
high level unjustified by economic fundamentals. But the independent futures
traders known as locals, unconcerned that the stock market has risen 1,000
points since the UK left the European exchange rate mechanism, continued to
lend their support. The locals were said to have bought March at around
3,385 and taken their profits at the high levels to bring it back to 3,396
by the official close, with turnover of 10,737 lots.
Dealers expected the squeeze on the March contract to continue until the end
of the year, with a liquidity shortage increased by imminent expiry of a
number of tailor-made OTC Footsie options.
In contrast, options activity returned to desultory levels, with total
volume of 31,594 lots and only 14,600 index options. Fisons, which has seen
the return of bid rumours, was the most active stock option with 1,864 lots
dealt. Trafalgar House, Ladbroke and BP also attracted business.

FT  21 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow drifts to slightly firmer
close
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US blue chip stocks inched ahead yesterday while the wider market edged
lower in subdued pre-holiday trading, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 3.64 higher at 3,755.21,
while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 eased 0.53 to 465.85. In the secondary
markets, the American SE composite was off 0.12 at 464.08, but the Nasdaq
composite firmed 0.92 to 760.15. NYSE volume came to 256m shares.
Stocks opened lower but quickly reversed course in a pattern that typifies
trading on Monday mornings following 'triple witching days', when the
quarterly expiration of options and futures contracts generates heavy volume
and exaggerates underlying market trends. On Friday the Dow industrials
gained 25.43 at 3,751.57.
However, with no fresh macro-economic news due until later in the week,
investors yesterday were left adrift, with only the listless bond market to
offer guidance.
Activity in US Treasuries was subdued ahead of today's keenly awaited
meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, in which the policy-making
panel was expected to adopt a bias towards tighter money, shifting from its
current stance of neutrality. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year
government bond was  5/16 lower at 99 9/32 , yielding 6.298 per cent.
Blue chips, which were ahead 8 points at mid-morning, meandered in and out
of negative territory most of the day, before closing with a slight gain.
However, some cyclical issues, which should benefit most from improved
economic conditions, were strong. Goodyear Tire added Dollars 5/8 at Dollars
44, Cummins Engine Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 51 3/4 , Caterpillar Dollars 1
1/4 at Dollars 87 5/8 and Tennaco Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 52 1/8 .
Allied Signal edged up Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 77 1/2 even though the stock
was downgraded by Oppenheimer. Union Carbide put on Dollars  7/8 at Dollars
22 1/4 . CPC International, the agricultural products company, was 1 3/8
higher at Dollars 47 3/4 after CS First Boston raised its rating to 'buy'
from 'hold'.
IBM fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 58 1/4 on the announcement that technical
problems would delay delivery of updated versions of its PS/2 personal
computer models.
In banking stocks, Wells Fargo climbed Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 128 3/4
after Brown Brothers Harriman boosted its estimate of the company's 1994
earnings.
Borden was marked up Dollars 5/8 to Dollars 18 5/8 on reports that its
directors were considering a plan to sell the ailing food and chemicals
company, either as a whole or in parts.
On the Amex, US Bioscience dropped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 9 1/4 on concern
that the US Food and Drug Administration would delay action on approving its
Ethyol ovarian cancer medication.
Canada
In spite of a rise in gold and other mining issues, Toronto ended flat as
the market came under pressure from tax-loss selling. Investors are making
use of the federal capital gains exemption for fear of it being scrapped in
February's budget.
The TSE 300 index was just 0.06 up at 4,223.6. Volume came to 59.3m shares
and falls outscored rises by 464 to 382.
The mining and gold indices rose 1.4 and 1.1 per cent respectively. The
transportation group had the day's biggest fall, 1.7 per cent.

Golds were supported by a rising bullion price, the index adding 58 at

Beers ended R1.75 ahead at R105, off a high that followed better 1993
diamond sales figures.

FT  21 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Allianz fall gives pause to
year-end rally talk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses climbed again and excited observers talked about year-end rallies
or, less ambitiously, about window dressing, writes Our Markets Staff.
However, a big line came out to test the Frankfurt market, and the response
suggested a certain lack of fibre in many of yesterday's gains.
FRANKFURT saw several blue chips reach new highs, Daimler rising DM35.20 to
DM789. The DAX index closed 27.14 higher at 2,178.16, and hit a new all-time
intraday high of 2,190.87 in the post-bourse before ending at 2,188.18.
However, Allianz, one of the leaders of the recent upswing, fell DM20 to
DM2,940. A major US investor decided to lock in some of its profits on the
stock late last Friday, and a London market maker took 50,000 to 60,000
shares on board; about half of those were sold on yesterday, and
professionals said that there was a message for the market in the insurer's
share price action.
Metallgesellschaft continued to languish on concerns about management
changes and the company's earnings position, falling DM23.10 to DM286.20.
There was little news on the corporate front, but construction stocks rose
as new building orders in western Germany, boosted by homebuilding demand,
showed rises of 2.3 per cent in the third quarter and 1.3 per cent in the
first nine months of 1993; Hochtief and Philipp Holzmann both rose DM20, to
DM1,070 and DM915 respectively.
PARIS came close enough to threaten a 1993 closing high nearly two months
old, the CAC-40 index finishing 27.03, or 1.2 per cent higher at 2,223.47
against a peak of 2,231.86 on October 22.
Turnover rose from FFr4.42bn to FFr5.1bn. Michelin, the tyremaker, hit its
own year's high, FFr6.30 higher at FFr205.30 after the French weekly, Le
Journal des Finances, said that it was on the road to recovery following a
positive note on the group from Lehman Brothers.
Recovery prospects on the US automotive scene were also good for Peugeot, up
FFr20 at FDFr746, and the components manufacturer, Valeo, FFr44 higher at
FFr1,269.
AMSTERDAM was fuelled by institutional demand, the CBS Tendency index adding
2.80, or 1.9 per cent to 146.10.
Unilever jumped Fl 5.70 to a year's high of Fl 223.60, due in part to its
well-received acquisition of a majority stake in French ice-cream maker
Miko.
ING peaked at an intraday Fl 92.90 before closing up Fl 3.00 at Fl 92.80 on
switching from other financial stocks.
VNU, the publisher rose Fl 7.50 to a 1993 high of Fl 165.00 although volume
was thin with only 50,000 shares traded.
Against the trend, DSM, the petrochemical group, was Fl 2.50 easier at Fl
105.00, after Friday's news that a European plan to cut ethylene capacity
had collapsed; Hoogovens, the steel group shed Fl1 to Fl 46.30 on Friday's
EC subsidies-for-capacity-cuts deal, on the view that it did not do enough
to alleviate the industry's problems.
ZURICH closed at a new high, the SMI put on 19.5 at 2,909.0. Ciba-Geigy
registered, SFr14 higher at SFr858, topped the active list, supported by
hopes that the group's industry division would gain strongly from an
economic upturn in Europe and the US.
Bearers in SMH, the watchmaker, sharply lower last week, rose SFr34 to
SFr1,004 on a forecast rise in 1993 sales and profits.
MADRID exercised its capacity to exaggerate gains elsewhere and broke
through resistance levels in the futures and cash markets, the general index
rising 5.61 or 1.8 per cent to a new 1993 high of 314.22 in turnover up from
Pta28.3bn to Pta33bn.
Construction stocks rose by more than 5 per cent with Uralita up Pta80 at
Pta1,260. However, the most active sector was utilities where Iberdrola rose
Pta30 to Pta999, and Fenosa Pta17 to Pta597.
MILAN was initially firm in response to the lower house of parliament's
approval of the 1994 budget over the weekend but the momentum was not
maintained and the the Comit index edged 3.57 higher to 606.01.
Against the trend, Ferruzzi added L931 or 3.4 per cent to L28,407 and
Montedison L68.30 to L929.10 ahead of the complicated capital increases
which begin today.
Among blue chips to suffer from profit-taking, Olivetti slid L28 to L2,082
and Pirelli L15 to L2,130. Telecoms also suffered with Sip off L25 to L3,442
and Stet down L62 to L4,136.
WARSAW climbed to a fourth consecutive record high, the WIG index rising by
244, or 2.3 per cent to 10,921 in the second highest ever turnover of
1,400bn zlotys.
Analysts predicted that prices could be lifted further after the public
oversubscribtion 6,600bn zlotys of a record 1,400bn zloty offering of Bank
Slaski shares.
STOCKHOLM was broadly higher as a rebound in LM Ericsson, the
telecommunications group, supported the market. The Affarsvarlden general
index added 9.2 to 1,370.3.
Ericsson's B share advanced SKr15 or 4.8 per cent, to SKr326 after a fall
from SKr477 earlier this year. Volvo continued higher adding SKr7 to SKr531
on news of the proposed new chairman and board.
HELSINKI saw heavy domestic and foreign demand push the Hex index 16.8
higher to 1,536.5. Nokia's ordinary shares closed FM8 higher at FM286,
partly helped by Ericsson's rise.

FT  21 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei sees year's
biggest fall as Manila surges 5.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Renewed political worries triggered a fall in the futures market, and the
Nikkei average suffered its largest loss of the year, writes Emiko Terazono
in Tokyo.
The concern surrounded a possible dissolution of the lower house if the
government's political reform bill failed to be enacted during the current
parliamentary session.
The Nikkei, which on Friday recovered the 18,000 level for the first time in
a month, dropped 647.67, or 3.6 per cent, to 17,404.24. The Topix index of
all first section stocks shed 43.22, or 2.9 per cent, to 1,447.25, but in
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 2.52 firmer at 1,194.34.
Remarks by the ruling and opposition party leaders over the weekend about
the possibility of a general election discouraged investors, since that
would delay decisions on economic stimulus.
Volume totalled 230m shares, against 282m. Declines led rises by 947 to 124,
with 103 issues unchanged.
The Nikkei index opened at the day's high of 18,025.80 and fell on arbitrage
unwinding, hitting a low of 17,383.44 a few minutes before the close.
Some traders were discouraged by Friday's announcement that the government
will postpone the flotation of Japan Tobacco, the state-owned tobacco and
salt monopoly.
Although good news for the overall market, traders who bought Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone and East Japan Railway stocks on hopes that they
would gain ground before the Japan Tobacco listing, liquidated their
holdings. NTT lost Y38,000 to Y751,000 and JR East Y34,000 to Y421,000.
Index-linked selling depressed banks. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y70 to
Y2,850 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank lost Y70 to Y1,780. Brokers were also weak,
with Nomura Securities down Y60 to Y1,820 and Nikko Securities off Y40 at
Y1,060.
In Osaka, the OSE average retreated 412.56 to 19,349.04 in volume of 39.1m
shares.
Roundup
The Pacific Rim saw further records in some markets and heavy profit-taking
in others after the strong advances of last week. Bombay remained closed for
the fifth consecutive day and hopes for an end to the protest over a ban on
forward trading were dashed late yesterday.
MANILA saw its biggest one-day jump this year, surging 5.5 per cent to an
all-time high on the back of PLDT's rally on Wall Street. The Manila index
rose 146.37 to 2,808.80.
PLDT hit a year's peak, climbing Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 68 7/8 in the US.
On the local market it advanced 125 pesos to 2,010 pesos.
HONG KONG extended its bull run with a 2.3 per cent advance to another
record high.
The Hang Seng index was ahead 245.92 at 10,814.78, after a day's peak of
10,824.36.
Buying interest by foreign institutions and small local investors increased
in the afternoon after selective demand was triggered by sharp gains in
futures.
KARACHI finished at another record high, with further strong demand by
foreign funds overcoming lower settlement day tendencies. The KSE 100 index
was 14.98 stronger at 2,043.90 at the close.
NEW ZEALAND opened firmly but turned easier later in the day, still sagging
under the weight of new issues and placements in recent weeks. The NZSE-40
capital index ended 7.26 down at 2,073.24.
TAIWAN gave up early gains to finish mixed and turnover fell sharply as a
consolidation after the recent bull run continued. The weighted index, 76
points ahead at one stage, ended only a net 1.88 higher at 5,204.02,
after worries over the Finance Ministry's imminent proposal to impose a
stock capital gains tax deterred buying.
AUSTRALIA drifted lower in quiet conditions as investors made an early start
to the holiday season. The All Ordinaries index closed 4.2 points down at
2,076.0, after peaking at 2,086.6 in early trade.
SEOUL saw profit-taking after last week's bull run, leaving the market 1.8
per cent off in thin trade. The composite index slipped 15.37 to 848.63 amid
modest volume of 34.11m.
SINGAPORE closed easier on profit-taking after last week's continuous rally,
with curbs on speculative buying by individual broking houses dampening the
mood.
The Straits Times Industrial index lost 2.78 at 2,277.48. after an intraday
peak of 2,314.89.
KUALA LUMPUR retreated in the afternoon to finish broadly lower, with the
sharp fall in Tokyo prompting profit-taking. The composite index dipped
below the 1,100 support level to end 11.45 down at 1,098.08.
BANGKOK receded as investors cashed in profits from recent strong rises in
banking, finance and securities shares. The SET index shed 17.12, or 1.1 per
cent, to 1,496.71 in active turnover of Bt23.29bn.

FT  21 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets: Focus remains on Italy and Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The same countries appeared at the top of the FT-Actuaries World Index
rankings last week - Italy, in Europe, and Hong Kong and Malaysia, in the
Pacific Basin - as headed the list the week before. There were signs
yesterday that they could stay in the public eye.
The depreciation of the lira this year means that Italy's performance, over
that period, has been only a little better than the European average in
sterling or dollar terms.
However, fans of the market say that Italy is due for a period of export led
growth after a decline in GDP this year, that consumer price inflation is
falling and that the country's political problems are likely to resolve
themselves favourably.
In the meantime, Mr Marcus Grubb, equity strategist at Salomon Brothers,
says Italian markets may be the focus of attention this week.
Last Friday the president, Mr Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, said that the country
was close to calling early general elections as Italians strove to turn over
a new leaf. This Thursday, says Mr Grubb, is the deadline for the passage of
the 1994 budget.
He adds that the improved position of the PDS at the December 5 elections
has already boosted financial markets, and that the re-establishment of a
centre-left party committed to financial retrenchment could provide the
boost that the stock market needs: it is not expensive, he says, on a 1994
p/e of 16.4 and with the BCI index 33.7 per cent below the all-time high of
908.2 in May, 1986.
Meanwhile, the Chinese warning that British companies will continue to lose
out in competition for business in China, unless Hong Kong Governor Chris
Patten backs down and shelves his democratic reforms, seemed to concentrate
minds about the risk of Chinese sanctions, and whom they would affect.
The colony's equity market built on the outstanding 10 per cent gain it
scored in the five days to December 10 with a 3.9 per cent rise last week,
and after yesterday's 2.3 per cent advance in the Hang Seng index it is
running very close to a 100 per cent rise on the year to date.
Malaysia cleared that mark last week, its 3.6 per cent gain taking it up by
103 per cent for the year so far. Yesterday in Paris the OECD said that
while export growth should ease during the next two years, this should be
offset by stronger domestic demand, and that the country was likely to score
an 8 per cent GDP growth rate this year, against 8.5 per cent in 1993.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Markets Report: Dollar firms against yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US dollar continued its ascent against the Japanese yen and also firmed
slightly against most European currencies. However, it ended the London
session off the day's highs on late profit-taking, writes Conner Middelmann.
Traders reported sluggish dealings as most market participants were squaring
their positions ahead of the holidays.
After breaching technical resistance at Y110.50, the US currency hit a
six-month high against the yen at Y110.80. It finished at Y110.55, up from
Y110.10 at Friday's close. In New York it ended at Y110.60. The yen also
lost some ground against the D-Mark, which closed at Y64.52, up from Y64.29
on Friday.
The yen continues to be undermined by concern that the fiscal measures
needed to boost the Japanese economy are being delayed by political
problems, said Mr Steve Hannah, chief economist at IBJ International.
Depressed by the stalled parliamentary debate on political reform and a
delay in the proposal for the draft budget for Japan's next fiscal year, the
Nikkei stock index slid 647 points to 17,404.
Continued speculation over further sharp cuts in the 1.75 per cent official
discount rate was also keeping the currency under pressure. While the market
is discounting a  1/2 percentage point reduction in the rate, there is
increasing talk of the discount rate falling to 0.5 per cent or even to zero
next year.
All this is in sharp contrast with the US, which has recently seen a string
of strong economic data. Moreover, as the Federal Reserve's Open Market
Committee (FOMC) meets today, there is increasing talk that the body may be
shifting from a neutral policy stance towards a slight tightening bias. The
minutes of the last FOMC meeting in November, due to be released this week,
will be keenly eyed for any hints of a policy shift.
The Italian lira posted a further rise against the D-Mark following
Saturday's approval of the 1994 budget package by the lower house of
parliament. The budget will now move to the Senate and market participants
are hoping for a swift approval before the December 23 deadline.
This spurred fresh hopes for a  1/2 percentage point cut in the 8 per cent
discount rate, with some observers saying it might happen before the end of
the year. 'A couple of years ago the Italians cut rates on December 20, and
last year they cut on December 22 - they are quite keen on last-minute
moves,' said Ms Alison Cottrell, European economist at Midland Global
Markets.
However, other analysts said they expect Italy to wait until the Bundesbank
lowers German interest rates again.
The Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in its
twice-yearly Economic Outlook yesterday said that, assisted by increased
fiscal stringency as well as income restraint, monetary policy in Italy is
set to ease, with nominal interest rates falling in line with German ones.
Italy's currency was further boosted by market rumours that the country's
credit rating was about to be upgraded. However, Moody's Investors Service,
who have rated Italian government debt single-A-1, said the country's credit
ratings are not currently under review.
The lira finished at L980.0 against the D-Mark, up from L985.8 at Friday's
close.
The D-Mark softened across the board in thin, trendless dealings.
The French franc rose to a new high since August's revamp of the European
exchange rate mechanism, reaching FFr3.4066 to the D-Mark. It ended at
FFr3.409, up from the previous close of FFr3.424. Data showing a FFr9.04bn
French current account surplus in September lent support to the franc, an
analyst said.
At its latest money market operation, the Bank of France drained FFr7.9bn
and left its intervention rate at the tender unchanged at 6.20 per cent.
The Belgian franc also firmed against the D-Mark, closing at BFr20.75, from
BFr20.91 on Friday.
The US dollar appreciated to DM1.7135 from Friday's DM1.7045. It closed in
New York at DM1.7129.
The German money market remained tight as seasonal pressures pushed the
overnight rate towards 6.20 per cent, prompting another injection of
temporary liquidity by the Bundesbank via its Paragraph 17 facility. The
Bundesbank today is due to call for bids on two-week securities repurchase
agreements at a fixed 6 per cent, for allocation tomorrow.
The sterling money market had a 'pretty peaceful day' thanks to a relatively
small shortage, a money dealer said.
The Bank of England announced a shortage of Pounds 650m which it later
revised to Pounds 850m. In its morning operation it purchased bills
totalling Pounds 165m: Pounds 40m of band 1 bank bills and Pounds 125m of
band 2 bank bills at 5 3/8 per cent. In the afternoon round it bought a
further Pounds 211m of band 1 and 2 bills, and finally provided late
assistance of around Pounds 430m.
The March short sterling futures contract edged ahead 0.01 point to 94.81.
The pound ended little changed at DM2.5450, up from DM2.5425 on Friday.
The Treasury's announcement that it plans to repay the Ecu5.0bn seven-year
revolving bank credit arranged in September 1992 had no impact on the money
market. 'I do not think this has any practical implications for the money
market,' another trader said.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canadian cod fishery faces
virtual shut-down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Canada's once-thriving east coast cod fishery will be almost entirely shut
down in 1994 as part of efforts to rebuild severely depleted stocks,
fisheries minister Mr Brian Tobin said yesterday.
Mr Tobin also announced that quotas for other groundfish species will be
severely cut, bringing next year's total allowable catch down to 250,000
tonnes, about a quarter of its level five years ago.
In addition, a two-year moratorium on northern cod catches off the coast of
Newfoundland, which was due to expire next May, will continue indefinitely.
The cuts are expected to cost 35,000 fishermen and processing plant workers
their jobs. The government has provided substantial income support for
unemployed fish workers since the Newfoundland cod moratorium took effect.
But a new system, now being designed, is expected to recognise the poor
long-term prospects for the fishing industry, by encouraging fish workers to
find jobs in other sectors of the economy.
The decline of the east coast fishery is blamed on a variety of causes,
including over-fishing by foreign and Canadian vessels and changes in water
temperatures and fish-migration patterns. Scientists have been especially
alarmed at the falling numbers of small, young fish.
Canada has urged its partners in the North Atlantic Fisheries Organisation
to impose more stringent controls on catches by foreign trawlers in
international waters. Mr Tobin said that domestic fishing fleets will in
future have to use bigger hooks and mesh sizes to minimise harvesting of
small fish.
The only cod fisheries that will remain open next year will be on the
western Scotian Shelf and on the Georges Bank off south-western Nova Scotia.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Diamond sales record reported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
De Beers, the South African group that controls more than 80 per cent of the
rough (uncut) diamond market, surprised analysts yesterday by reporting that
diamond sales this year by its London-based Central Selling Organisation
reached a record USDollars 4.366bn.
This was well ahead of most forecasts, 28 per cent up on last year's Dollars
3.417bn and 5 per cent above the previous record of Dollars 4.172bn in 1988.
De Beers warned, however, that there were some signs of over-supply in the
lower and cheaper quality range of rough diamonds following sales from
strategic stockpiles by the Russian and US governments.
There were also worrying sales of larger-sized, gem-quality diamonds from
Russia's treasury in the past two weeks which were in clear breach of the
republic's 1990 agreement with De Beers which gave the South African group
exclusive marketing rights to 95 per cent of Russia's rough diamond output.
Diamonds were set aside by the US and Russian strategic stockpiles for
industrial and technical use but the subsequent development of the Indian
industry, which can economically cut and polish very small stones, means
that today many of the stockpiled diamonds are cutable. For example, in two
tenders, the US stockpile not only sold 1.15m carats of industrial diamonds
for Dollars 6.5m but also 1.35m carats of small gem diamonds for Dollars
111.41m.
De Beers said retail diamond jewellery sales had held up well, given the
weakness of the global economy. If the Christmas selling season turned out
as expected, retail diamond jewellery sales this year would be marginally
higher than in 1992 when 55m pieces worth Dollars 41bn were sold.
There was strong retail sales growth this year in the US and east Asia (Hong
Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan and China). Sales in Japan, which vies
with the US to be the biggest market, each accounting for about a third of
western world sales, were down in local currency terms but, because of the
yen's strength, up in dollars.
Mr Michael Coulson, analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing, part of the French
financial services group, said that even though diamond sales beat best
estimates it did not mean the market was particularly buoyant. De Beers had
been re-filling supply pipelines, he suggested, and consequently it would
have difficulty reaching Dollars 4bn of sales in 1994. Also De Beers'
attributable profit was unlikely to show as substantial an increase as its
diamond sales.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa market plunges further
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Speculators stepped up pressure on the world cocoa market yesterday, forcing
prices to the lowest level since early October.
At the London Commodity Exchange the March futures position closed at Pounds
904 a tonne, down Pounds 62 on the day, Pounds 132 over the past week, and
Pounds 165 from the 5 3/4 -year high reached on December 3.
There was no fresh fundamental news to explain the snow-balling sell-off,
said Mr Lawrence Eagles. 'It was all down to massive long liquidation of
speculative positions,' which had been been built up during the period of
uncertainty about the health of Mr Felix Houphouet-Boigny, veteran president
of the Ivory Coast, the world's biggest producer of cocoa, whose death was
announced two weeks ago.
In the event the power struggle that had been feared failed to materialise
and the market was left at the mercy of the bearish developments that had
been masked by the Ivorian factor - heavier-than-expected arrivals from West
African harvests and signs that the Ivory Coast would not, after all, be
delaying the marketing of its mid-crop cocoa.
Mr Eagles said longer term prospects for the market remained bullish as
rising consumption and flagging production continued to eat into excess
stocks. And he thought a move below Pounds 900 a tonne in the near term was
likely to attract manufacturers back into the market.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: The mysterious berry that
brightens our yule-tide board - Cranberry jelly is a familiar accompaniment
to Christmas turkey, but where is the fruit grown, and how? / Farmer's
Viewpoint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Christmas dinner would be the poorer without them. The turkey would look
pale and uninteresting were it not for the dash of colour they provide; and
their subtle taste enhances the flavour of the meat, which, lets face it,
from modern fast grown hybrids can be somewhat bland.
Yet, I confess that until a few months ago I had given them little thought.
Subconsciously, I suppose, I had assumed they grew on bushes or briars like
black currants or blackberries.
But in spite of the fact that I had been farming for nearly 40 years and for
most of that time had travelled around the world looking at farm crops
whenever the opportunity arose, I was taken completely by surprise when I
saw this one for the first time.
I am referring, of course, to cranberries, or rather the jelly that is
derived from them, large dollops of which I hope we shall all be enjoying
next weekend.
So, what is a cranberry and where does it come from? Six months ago I could
not have answered those questions. Then I went to Canada and a few miles
south of Vancouver in the delta of the Fraser River I came upon the first
cranberries I had ever seen.
For the cranberry is native to North America. Moreover it is one of only
three berries originating from that entire continent - the other two being
the blueberry and the concord grape.
Given that turkeys also originated in North America it is reasonable to
suppose that Red Indians discovered that cranberries complemented the
flavour of the meat of the wild birds and passed on that culinary
intelligence to early settlers as they explored and colonised.
The history of the cranberry, however, seems less remarkable to me, a
farmer, than its agronomy. For cranberries grow on what can only be
described as low lying peat bogs. They are, in fact, perennial wetland
plants and have a similar growing habit to heather. The plants have short,
wiry stalks and in spring the pink flowers make cranberry fields look a
little like flat grouse moors.
But wild and natural today's cranberry fields are not. The bogs in which
cranberries are planted are laser levelled and subterranean irrigation is
installed to ensure that optimum soil moisture levels can be maintained at
all times. And the roads between the fields are also most unusual. Because
of the boggy nature of the land and the fact that heavy gravel and stones
would sink into it the farm tracks are made of light lumber waste such as
chippings and sawdust. They are also built up several feet higher than the
low lying cranberry bogs.
These high roads are needed for the cranberry harvest. When autumn comes the
red shiny berries are ready to pick. A few for the whole fruit trade are
carefully gathered by hand, packed in boxes and sent to market; but by far
the majority of the cranberries grown in Canada and the US are used for
processing into jam and jelly. These do not need to be handled so gently and
growers have devised what must surely be a unique technique for harvesting
them.
Using the built up roads between the cranberry fields as dams each bog is
flooded to a depth of about a meter so that water covers all the vegetation.
A small, light, mechanised push tractor with a rotating metal reel fitted on
the front is then driven down a ramp on to the bog of ripe fruit. The reel
thrashes the plants under the surface of the water and knocks off the
cranberries which float to the surface. A finished field it looks from a
distance like a bog full of blood.
The whole farming family then dons long salmon fishing type boots and
leggings and goes down in to the flooded bog with a kind of flexible
barrage. The barrage ahead of them, they push and shove the floating
cranberries towards one corner of the bog where a rubber elevator, its base
in the water, takes the fruit up into a trailer on the lumber waste road.
The harvested fruit is then delivered to the processor.
How much the crop was worth and what level of profit might be expected from
it, however, remained something of a mystery to me. Growers were only too
happy to talk about the costs and complications of producing cranberries but
were a little coy about the returns.
They told me, for instance, that the crop could only be grown successfully
in North America and even there only in a few places where land quality and
micro-climate were just right. And they reminded me that a crop with most of
its sales concentrated into the few weeks before Christmas each year was
bound to be volatile and high risk.
But I suspect they might have been trying to head off possible competition.
For they could not hide their obvious prosperity.
As I spoon the delicious red jelly on to my plate on Christmas day, however,
I shall not grudge them the profit they make from my enjoyment.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Analysts attack US mining law
plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Proposed changes to US mining laws are likely 'to lead to more litigation,
more delays, fewer jobs and less wealth-creation' if they are not rewritten
'in a more workable and co-operative problem-solving manner,' according to
Goldman Sachs, the US financial services group.
'We share the concern of the industry about the growing potential power of
citizen suits and the increasing legal fuzziness of issues like land
'suitability' and 'acceptable' environmental compliance', say analysts Amy
Gassman and Alexandra Zawadiwsky.
They suggest a 'compromise' version of the mining law reform is likely to be
passed during 1994 and this could affect the earnings of several gold mining
companies from 1995 onwards.
The analysts say it is likely that gross royalties between 3 per cent and 5
per cent could be levied on federal unpatented lands and add 'we believe the
industry can live with a moderate new royalty structure.'
They point out that only a very small number of exploration prospects
eventually become mines. 'Thus, to introduce greater uncertainty into the
exploration process (will the project receive permits, will it be located on
suitable lands?) further reduces the already-slim probabilities associated
with the search for new mines. In order to increase the probabilities,
miners are looking (outside the US) where there has not been as much
activity.'
However, this move to offshore exploration also 'reflects the intersection
of several positive trends - the move toward a market economy and democratic
government in several Latin American countries, the availability of large
areas of unexplored prospective acreage offshore, the passage of new mining
legislation to protect ownership rights and the ability to remit profits -
at the very time that the process for exploring and developing properties in
the US is becoming more uncertain and time-consuming.'
The existing Mining Act of 1872 has been under attack by some US politicians
for years because it enables mining companies to apply for a patent on
federal land on which they are mining or plan to mine for a one-time fee of
Dollars 5 an acre. Also, once patented, the land and the minerals contained
in it are transferred from the public to the private sector and are exempt
from any further rental or royalty payments to the Federal Treasury.
Critics say the present system does not provide a financial return to the
American people for the use of public domain lands.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Government Bonds: Italy rallies on hopes of cut in interest
rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and FRANK MCGURTY

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italian government bonds rallied strongly on hopes of an interest rate cut
following the approval of the 1994 budget by the Chamber of Deputies over
the weekend.
With the budget expected to be passed by the senate, market participants
believe that the Bank of Italy may cut its discount rate soon, adding that
such a move would be more likely if the next set of CPI figures showed that
inflation was holding steady.
Among the other high-yielding European government bond markets, Spain
rallied on the back of strong foreign interest rather than any particular
domestic factors.
UK government bonds kicked off on a strong note, but profit-taking dragged
the gilts down and the market closed generally lower on the day.
Much of the economic data released yesterday was in line with market
expectations, according to Mr Jonathan Davies, economist at UBS.
However, he added that the fall in the savings ratio was taken to mean that
the chance of an imminent interest rate cut had diminished.
Dealers said the moves were exaggerated given the thin pre-Christmas volume.
Japanese government bonds continued to climb to new highs on the combination
of stock market weakness, political uncertainty, and strong hopes of a big
cut in interest rates, dealers said.
The futures contract, which opened at 116.16 in Tokyo, reached a new
all-time high of 117.05 in the London trading session yesterday, having
closed at 116.90 in Japan.
Market hopes of a cut in interest rates were refuelled after a news report
at the weekend suggested that one of the coalition parties had proposed
lowering the discount rate - currently at 1.75 per cent - to between zero
and 0.5 per cent.
The Nikkei stock index tumbled 647.67 points, the largest one-day drop this
year, to end at 17,404.24, adding to market expectations of an easing.
The Ministry of Finance postponed its auction of 10-year bonds which had
been expected today until early next year and said it was considering
offering 20-year government bonds today.
The MOF is expected to offer Y300bn-Y400bn of 20-year bonds instead of the
Y1,000bn 10-year bonds that were expected.
The US bond prices softened yesterday in light activity ahead of today's
Federal Reserve policy-making session and the Treasury's auction of two-year
and five-year notes.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  1/4 lower at 99
5/16 , with the yield rising to 6.294 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was off  3/32 at 100 1/16 , to yield 4.198 per cent.
With no fresh macroeconomic guidance and conflicting trends in commodity
prices, the market quickly moved lower in thin trading and held steady for
the remainder of the day.
Traders were concerned about the prospects of the Federal Open Market
Committee taking the first step towards raising short-term interest rates.
It is widely expected the FOMC, which meets today in Washington, will shift
from its stance of neutrality and adopt a bias towards tighter money.
At the short end, the market faces an influx of notes at a time when most
large institutional investors have locked up their positions for the year.
The Treasury will auction a Dollars 17bn auction of two-year notes today and
Dollars 11bn in five-year notes on Wednesday.

FT  21 DEC 93 / International Bonds: GECC injects life into quiet CDollars
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACTIVITY in the Eurobond market was quiet in the run-up to Christmas
yesterday, apart from a last-minute attempt by Wood Gundy to narrow the gap
with ScotiaMcLeod in the Canadian dollar sector.
ScotiaMcLeod, which has lead-managed CDollars 5.3bn worth of Canadian
dollar-denominated Eurobond and global bond offerings this year, has wrested
the number one slot from Wood Gundy.
Before yesterday's CDollars 125m offering for GECC, Wood Gundy had
underwritten just over CDollars 5bn worth of business.
GECC's Eurobonds, which had a maturity of just under six years, were priced
to yield 15 basis points over Canadian Treasuries.
Wood Gundy said the yield spread on the bonds was comparable to or slightly
more generous than spreads on GECC's outstanding Canadian dollar paper.
When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread narrowed slightly to 14 basis
points.
Wood Gundy added that the borrower wanted to raise funds with a maturity of
more than five years where its funding targets were less aggressive. The
bonds appealed mainly to investors in Switzerland and the Benelux where GECC
has a strong following.
Elsewhere, European Sovereign Investments, a bond-arbitrage company based in
Luxembourg, launched a SFr150m issue of three-year floating-rate notes which
are secured by European Union government bonds.
Lead manager Credit Suisse said the notes, which carry a coupon equal to
six-month Libor, were targeted at money-market and short-term funds. The
notes had an issue price of 100.50 and in the early afternoon they were
quoted at less 0.60 bid, which Credit Suisse said was inside undisclosed
fees.
Credit Suisse has set up a Dollars 1.5bn Euro-medium term note programme
which will be used as a shelf for the bank's future public and private
borrowings in the Eurobond market. Credit Suisse is expected to start using
the programme in the new year.
The programme, which was signed late last week, was arranged by CS First
Boston, CSFB Effectenbank AG and CS First Boston France SA.
The notes can be issued for any maturity between one month and 30 years and
in a broad range of curren-cies.
NatWest Capital Markets and N M Rothschild have arranged a Pounds 150m
five-year credit facility for T&amp;N, the UK motor components and engineering
group.
The annual margin on the syndicated revolving facility is 47.50 basis points
over Libor for the first three years and 50 basis points over Libor for the
last two years.
The participation fee for managers is 12.50 basis points and 7.50 basis
points for participants.

FT  21 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Gloom lifts Tokyo bonds -
Yields are at six-year lows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mounting gloom over the Japanese economy, poor corporate earnings, a weak
stock market, and a high yen have contributed to active buying of the
Japanese bond market this year, pushing long bond yields down to six-year
lows.
Although the strengthening of the yen seems to have ran its course, a
further deterioration of the economy is likely to continue to support the
bond market rally. Some analysts predict the yield on the No 157 benchmark
bond will fall below 2.55 per cent, a record low reached in 1987.
The 10-year bond rallied at the start of the year, but suffered a brief
relapse in April and May, as hopes of an imminent economic recovery were
raised by good economic figures. However, the increases in output and sales
were a result of window dressing ahead of the March fiscal year end, and the
bond market resumed its rally in June.
The announcement by the coalition government of a Y6,150bn spending package
and a cut in the official discount rate to a record low of 1.75 per cent in
September failed to lift confidence.
While some institutional investors, wary of high prices in the bond market,
started to take profits, the chronic weakness of the stock market has kept
many investors from liquidating their holdings.
Fears over the worsening economy and lower corporate profits pushed the
Tokyo stock market to a year's low last month, prompting the Bank of Japan
to increase liquidity in the money markets.
The rise in demand for bonds has been partly due to the popularity of money
management funds, offered by brokers as a relatively safe product which
invests in short-term money market and corpo-rate and government bonds.
The outstanding balance of MMFs, which offer higher yields than bank
deposits, rose above the Y10,000bn mark in October, as retail and corporate
investors shifted from bank deposits to MMFs.
Large purchases of 20-year government bonds by US hedge funds, betting on a
flattening of the yield curve, have led to lower long-term interest rates.
Many fund managers saw the 20-year bonds, which in the past have experienced
little activity, as underpriced compared to 10-year bonds.
On the corporate bond market, an increasing number of companies raised
funds, attracted by the low interest rates. Japanese companies raised
Y3,024bn during the first 10 months of the year, up 19.2 per cent from the
same period last year. An easing of eligibility restrictions also helped
lift issuance.
Lower underwriting costs due to increased competition has helped. The entry
of bank subsidiaries into the underwriting business has led to aggressive
discounting of underwriting fees. For example, the Big Four brokers, Nomura,
Daiwa, Nikko, and Yamaichi, recently resigned from the underwriting
syndication for Kobe Steel bonds in protest at the discounts offered by the
bank affiliated houses.
However, the illiquid secondary market is still causing inefficient pricing,
including the lack of price differentiation according to credit ratings.
This has affected Japan's samurai bond market for foreign borrowers. Since
cost differences between issuers with high credit ratings and low ratings
are smaller than in other markets, issuers with triple-A ratings opt for the
Eurobond market, while issuers with low credit ratings have piled in.
'Japan's samurai market is turning into a junk bond market,' laments an
analyst.
In the coming year, analysts expect yields in the government bond market to
be supported by bad news on the economy. Mr Kazuo Tamayama, director at
Yasuda Kasai Brinson Investment Management, points out that consumption will
be the key to bond market movements.
The recent trend among Japanese consumers to buy products at discount prices
points to lower corporate profit margins. 'Consumers taking the leadership
role in determining prices means a further fall in corporate earnings and
lower interest rates,' he says.
Mr Marshall Gittler, bond analyst at Merrill Lynch in Tokyo, is bullish
about bonds and expects the 10-year benchmark to breach 2.55 per cent.
Ms Tomoko Fujii, economist at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, is more
conservative. She expects bond prices to peak in February, and predicts a
shift of sentiment after a cut in the official discount rate around February
or March.
This is the first in a series of articles on aspects of the international
capital markets, examining the prospects for next year and looking back at
1993.

FT  21 DEC 93 / International Company News: Ameritech and GE unite to
develop data service group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Ameritech, the Chicago-based telecommunications company, and General
Electric, the US conglomerate, are joining forces in a information services
business which will develop electronic commerce and inter-company
communications.
They announced yesterday that Ameritech would invest Dollars 472m in the
newly formed company, while GE would contribute the assets of its General
Electric Information Services division, which specialises in electronic data
exchange and electronic commerce.
The move came just 24 hours after Ameritech, in conjunction with its German
partner Deutsche Telekom, was selected to take a stake in Matav, the
Hungarian state telecoms concern, as part of eastern Europe's largest single
privatisation deal. Ameritech's stake will cost it Dollars 437.5m.
GE's information services division, which has revenues of Dollars 600m and
is based in Rockville, Maryland, was founded in the 1960s as a computer
time-sharing business and evolved into an electric commerce company in the
1980s when the personal computer revolution reduced demand for time-sharing.
The business helps companies exchange documents electronically with
suppliers and customers, increasing efficiency and eliminating paperwork. It
advises on internal company communications.
The new company initially will be wholly owned and operated by GE.
Ameritech's investment will be a four-year convertible note which will
convert into a 30 per cent equity stake when certain legal restrictions are
removed.

CHASE Securities, a division of Chase Manhattan Bank, has joined Crescent
Capital, a Los Angeles money management concern, in setting up one of the
first US institutional funds to invest in all levels of corporate capital,
including bank loans and high-yield securities.
Mr Mark Gold, managing director of the New York office of Crescent Capital,
which will manage the fund, said it 'provides the portfolio manager with the
flexibility to not only identify the companies in which to invest, but also
select the most appropriate part of the capital structure in which to
invest'.
The new limited partnership, Crescent/Mach1 Partners, has raised Dollars
530m through the private placement of Dollars 400m in class A senior notes
and Dollars 40m in class B senior subordinated notes, as well as Dollars 90m
in equity supplied by Chase and other sources.
To generate profits, the fund will function much like a bank, reinvesting
the money in financial instruments which bring higher returns than the cost
of obtaining the capital.

Nike, the US maker of athletic shoes and sports wear, yesterday confirmed
the gloomy trend in its financial performance by reporting a 30 per cent
fall in net income to Dollars 52.3m from Dollars 76m in its second quarter
to November 30.
Mr Philip Knight, chairman, delivered a robust defence of the company's
strategy and said he was optimistic about next year's autumn back-to-school
season and beyond. 'We remain the best-positioned company in the industry to
grow as we enter fiscal 1995,' he said
Nike, which warned in September that this financial year's figures would
fall short of 1992-93 levels, has been suffering from a shift in purchasers'
tastes away from basketball and other sports shoes towards the rugged
footwear made by companies such as Timberland and Dr Martens.
Sales in the latest quarter fell by 8 per cent to Dollars 805.8m from
Dollars 875.8m, and net income per share fell by 30 per cent to 69 cents
from 98 cents. For the six months to date, net income was down to Dollars
166.4m from Dollars 198.6m.
Nike said adverse shifts in exchange rates were partly to blame for the
fall. On a constant dollar basis, it said, revenues would have been down by
only 1 per cent and net income per share would have been 77 cents.
Looking ahead, the company said worldwide orders for footwear and apparel
for delivery between December and next April were Dollars 1.4bn, some 14 per
cent below the comparable period. But Mr Knight said these figures disguised
the reasons for optimism.
Nike had a significant and growing share in the US market for rugged
casuals, Mr Knight, but its solid advances in this sector had been
overshadowed by a 25 per cent decline in its revenues from basketball shoes,
a sector that had been experiencing 'the ebb and flow common in this
industry between individual categories'.

The Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company, the troubled US supermarket chain
better known as A&amp;P, reported a fall in net income from Dollars 422,000 to
Dollars 379,000 in its third quarter ended December 4.
Sales were down from Dollars 2.38m to Dollars 2.34m and net earnings per
share were unchanged at 1 cent.
Net income for the first nine months was Dollars 23.4m, compared with
Dollars 30.9m before non-recurring charges or a loss of Dollars 149.4m after
non-recurring charges.
A&amp;P is controlled by Tengelmann, a German retailing group. Tengelmann
acquired a majority stake in the company in 1981 and brought it back from
near-bankruptcy. But A&amp;P has come under fire from the New York state
employees' pension fund for its recent poor performance.
Mr James Wood, the English chairman and chief executive installed by
Tengelmann, said a strike had closed 63 Miracle Food Mart and Ultra Mart
stores in Ontario, Canada, on November 19.
He estimated that lost revenue and the costs of closing the stores wiped 6
cents off third-quarter earnings per share.
Same store sales, excluding the 63 closed stores, were 1 per cent lower than
in last year's third quarter and 1.1 per cent lower for the first nine
months of the year, he said.

national airline

<TEXT>
CRISIS talks between CSA, the Czech national airline, and minority
shareholders, Air France and the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD), got under way in Prague yesterday.
As they did so a senior Air France official firmly dismissed suggestions in
the Czech press that the French company was contemplating withdrawing its
investment in CSA.
'There is absolutely no question of Air France pulling out of its
participation in CSA. Our investment is a long term investment. What we are
doing is holding discussions with the (Czech) government to find solutions
to CSA's financial and operational problems,' Mr Francois Eldin, Air France
vice-president for communications, said yesterday.
Air France, jointly with the Caisse des Depots, and the EBRD bought 40 per
cent of the Czech airline's shareholding capital in 1992. Air France
invested Dollars 18m, the Caisse des Depots Dollars 12m and the EBRD Dollars
30m.
Yesterday's extraordinary meeting of shareholders in Prague was called after
a recently published audit by consultants Ernst &amp; Young found the Czech
company had been overvalued by some Kcs746m (Dollars 25.7m) when it was
partially privatised.
The decision to have a new audit was made following talks between Mr Bernard
Attali, then Air France's president, and Czech ministers, before the summer.
Air France and the EBRD are asking the Czech government to make up the
difference between the two valuations by an equivalent injection of fresh
capital into CSA.
But until now, the Czech government, which still owns 49 per cent of the
shares through its National Property Fund, an institution established to
manage privatisations, and the state's shareholding, has been cool to the
idea of providing new finance for the airline which faces mounting losses.

International Business Machines is delaying the release of two upgraded PS/2
personal computer models due to technical problems, Reuter reports from New
York.
'We are informing customers that our PS/2 76 and 77 models will be severely
constrained in January and February due to technical problems,' a spokesman
said.
IBM said that during final stress tests, the new models did not meet its
guidelines for reliability. The company added that the problems stemmed from
a specialised chip that handles complicated memory tasks.
The models were intended to be launched in January and February. The company
would not estimate when the upgraded models would be ready. However, this is
the second delay for the launch which was previously stalled last autumn.
IBM said it was increasing production of the 76 and 77 models to meet
demand. A spokesman confirmed industry estimates that IBM has sold about 14m
of the models since the PS/2 came out in 1987.

CHASE Securities, a division of Chase Manhattan Bank, has joined Crescent
Capital, a Los Angeles money management concern, in setting up one of the
first US institutional funds to invest in all levels of corporate capital,
including bank loans and high-yield securities.
Mr Mark Gold, managing director of the New York office of Crescent Capital,
which will manage the fund, said it 'provides the portfolio manager with the
flexibility to not only identify the companies in which to invest, but also
select the most appropriate part of the capital structure in which to
invest'.
The new limited partnership, Crescent/Mach1 Partners, has raised Dollars
530m through the private placement of Dollars 400m in class A senior notes
and Dollars 40m in class B senior subordinated notes, as well as Dollars 90m
in equity supplied by Chase and other sources.
To generate profits, the fund will function much like a bank, reinvesting
the money in financial instruments which bring higher returns than the cost
of obtaining the capital.
The loans made to Mach1 carry low interest payments because of the fund's
plans to diversify its investments and to maintain minimum credit quality of
its assets.
In contrast to funds that invest exclusively in bank loans, Mach1 will buy
Dollars 300m in non-investment-grade loans, or junk bonds, and Dollars 200m
in high-yield securities. In addition, it will place some Dollars 30m in
corporate equity. Mach1's strategy of spreading its investments across a
range of financial instruments enhances its potential of generating greater
returns than competing funds.

Bombardier, the international aerospace and transit equipment group,
yesterday launched its long-range Global Express business jet programme. The
aircraft will have a range up to 6,500 nautical miles, longer than its
competitor, the Gulfstream V.
The aircraft's first flight is due in 1996 and it should go into service in
1998. The base selling price will be about USDollars 28m, plus interior
fittings.
Its development will cost almost CDollars 1bn (USDollars 747m) and will be
shared between Bombardier, BMW Rolls-Royce, the engine builder, and
Mitsubishi of Japan, which will build the wings and centre fuselage, and
possibly others.
The aircraft is a new design, though Bombardier has benefited from its
experience with its regional jet, a 50-seater commuter aircraft.
Bombardier has 30 firm orders, eight short-term options and is negotiating
12 more sales for a total backlog of USDollars 1bn.
A large order from mid-east customers in November helped to swing the
decision, and Bombardier sees a total world market of about 800 for such
long-range business jets.

THE Western Harbour Tunnel Company, which is to build Hong Kong's third
harbour tunnel, yesterday signed an agreement with 22 international banks to
raise HKDollars 5.2bn (USDollars 673m) over 15 years for construction costs.
The financing, which includes a 15-year term loan and revolving facility,
was clinched despite what arrangers Wardley Capital described as tight
pricing. Interest will be paid at 1-1.5 per cent above Hibor.
In spite of political uncertainty over the colony's future, companies are
increasingly managing to raise finance with pay-back terms straddling 1997,
when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty.
Mr Calum McKinlay, an executive of Wardley Capital, said: 'The project has
been approved by both the Chinese representatives of the Joint Liaison Group
and the Hong Kong Government, the Executive Council and the Legislative
Council (LegCo).'
The sum raised puts the Western Harbour Tunnel Company among the colony's
biggest borrowers in the loans market.
The dual three-lane tunnel is due to open in August 1997.

<TEXT>
SPAR, one of Germany's main retailers, has acquired eastern Germany's former
state-run store network from the Treuhand privatisation agency.
The 221 outlets, the largest block sale of retailing outlets by the
Treuhand, are likely to consolidate Spar's position in eastern Germany when
retailers in the cities are trying to win back consumers from the giant
shopping centres built on greenfield sites. The Treuhand would not disclose
the selling price.
The outlets were part of the state-owned Handelsorganisation (HO) chain of
food and department stores, which totalled 642, and which were placed under
the Treuhand in late 1990.
Spar intends to invest more than DM35m (Dollars 20.7m) and had already
invested DM50m in HO outlets after renting many of them from the Treuhand.
The agency has only recently been able to sell the outlets after resolving
outstanding property and restitution claims.

FT  21 DEC 93 / International Company News: Paramount receives fresh
takeover bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Viacom, the cable television company, and QVC Network, the television
shopping business, both submitted fresh takeover offers yesterday to
Paramount Communications, the entertainment company which has put itself up
for auction.
Paramount did not disclose the value of the two proposals submitted by the
4pm deadline that had been set for bidders' best offers, but said that the
board would evaluate each of them.
Late in the afternoon QVC said its plan to announce the value of its bid had
been blocked by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees the
securities industry.
It added that it was still negotiating with the SEC and might be able to
announce the offer later in the day. Viacom declined to comment on whether
it would reveal its bid.
The Paramount board is expected to meet today to review the bids and will
eventually recommend one of them, though shareholders will be free to accept
whichever one they choose.
Before last night's developments, QVC had a bid on the table worth around
Dollars 10bn and Viacom one of Dollars 9.6bn.
Just 24 hours before the deadline Mr Sumner Redstone, chairman of Viacom,
issued a strong defence of controversial purchases of his company's stock in
recent months - some by a private company he owns and some by an investment
firm in which he holds a stake.
Mr Redstone's statement appeared designed to reassure the board of Paramount
and Wall Street of the value of Viacom's stock, which is likely to form part
of the company's revised bid.
There has been speculation in the US media that the share purchases could
have helped bolster Viacom's share price.
Viacom said, however, that 'rather than inflating the price of Viacom
securities, the more legitimate inquiry is whether the repeated, inaccurate
and misinformed publication of rumours and innuendo has served the agenda of
QVC by damaging the reputation of Viacom's management and by artificially
damaging the market price of Viacom stock.'
It added that investments in Viacom by Mr Redstone's private company,
National Amusements, had taken place in the period preceding the announced
merger with Viacom and were part of a well-publicised market purchase
programme which had been in effect for six years.

FT  21 DEC 93 / International Company News: Dark horse takes wheel at Volvo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bert-Olof Svanholm, the new chairman-designate of Volvo, could hardly
have a less public profile than his controversial, headline-grabbing
predecessor, Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar.
'Not very well known' or 'I don't know too much about him' were typical
comments from analysts in Stockholm, who had previously regarded Mr Marcus
Storch, the chief executive of Aga, the gas group, as the front-runner for
the job. But his relative anonymity was not counting against Mr Svanholm
yesterday.
Market reaction - Volvo's most actively traded B shares ended the day up
SKr6 at SKr531 - was positive as the appointment was seen as placing a solid
industrial figure at the head of an equally heavyweight, industrial board in
charge of Sweden's biggest manufacturing group.
Mr Svanholm has been a senior lieutenant to Mr Percy Barnevik, the Swedish
chief of Asea Brown Boveri, the Swedish Swiss engineering giant, since 1982
when he became deputy chief executive at the pre-merger Asea.
Since 1988 he has been chief executive of ABB's Swedish operation. In that
role he has headed a big productivity drive known as T50, an ambitious
project aimed at cutting by 50 per cent the time taken between receiving
orders and achieving delivery.
In the meantime, Mr Svanholm has quietly become a stalwart of Sweden's
industrial and business establishment. He has been chairman of the Swedish
Manufacturer's Association since 1990 and is a vice-chairman of the
Federation of Swedish Industry.
Before joining Asea, he held senior posts at Swedish Match and Nitro Nobel.
Aged 58, he is a civil engineer by qualification, like so many top Swedish
managers. Mr Gyllenhammar, by contrast, arrived at Volvo as chief executive
in 1971 after running Skandia, the insurance group.
Mr Svanholm is set to complement the day-to-day leadership of Volvo by Mr
Soren Gyll, the chief executive who led the management revolt that ditched
the merger agreement with Renault earlier this month.
Mr Gyll was reported yesterday to be very pleased at the nomination of Mr
Svanholm. Analysts expect the two men to shift Volvo strategy towards a
tighter focus on its core car and truck operations after the often
extravagant schemes of Mr Gyllenhammar to diversify Volvo away from vehicle
making.
'I think he is on the same wavelength as Soren Gyll,' said one analyst. 'He
fits the market expectation that Volvo will now concentrate on its vehicle
business.'
Certainly, the contrast with Mr Gyllenhammar will be great. Where 'PG'
relished the role of prickly outsider, based in Gothenburg, the 'second
city', Mr Svanholm will be at ease and fully trusted by his Stockholm-based
institutional shareholders.

FT  21 DEC 93 / International Company News: Telekom takes a strategic bet on
Matav - The Dollars 875m winning bid for a stake in Hungarian telecoms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The acquisition by a consortium led by Deutsche Telekom, the German state
telecoms company, of 30 per cent of Hungarian operator Matav dwarfs earlier
east European privatisations.
Deutsche Telekom and partner Ameritech, the US regional operator, are paying
Dollars 875m for the stake. To put the figure in context, Hungary's previous
largest foreign sale was the Dollars 150m purchase by General Electric of
the US of 50 per cent of Tungsram, the light bulb producer.
The price paid for Matav, which values the company at Dollars 2.92bn and was
at the high end of expectations, reflects the fierce competition between the
three groups which put in final bids. Stet International, the Italian state
group, displayed deep pockets with by far the highest bid in the first round
and set a benchmark for the ultimate offers.
Telekom knew that it had to come close to Stet on price and at the same time
watch out for the powerful partnership of France Telecom and US West, the
regional Bell company, two groups with long involvements in Hungary.
While the three contenders may have egged each other on, executives at each
are adamant that they never went beyond an economic valuation of Matav.
The intensity of the bidding war reflects the underlying attractions of
Matav to international telecoms companies. 'They wanted it incredibly
badly,' says Mr Michael Phair of NM Rothschild, advisers to the Hungarian
government on the transaction.
The enthusiasm shown for Matav was especially striking given the
uncertainties that surrounded its privatisation. Telekom's investigation of
the Hungarian company's accounts turned up Dollars 200m of variation in
estimates of indebtedness.
In up to 25 of Hungary's 54 local telephone areas rivals can bid for
concessions early next year and Matav risks being left with the least
lucrative regions.
Even where conditions are firm, they are not the most generous. The
regulatory framework links tariffs to producer prices, which currently lag
well behind consumer prices. And the Hungarian state, in contrast to the
South American telecoms privatisations, retains control of a majority of
shares and the post of chief executive.
Matav also requires a large amount of investment. Even after a vigorous
three-year development plan, Hungary has only 1.5m main lines, or 15 for
every 100 inhabitants, and over 700,000 are on the waiting list for phones.
The government is insisting on 15 per cent line growth annually.
Tremendous suppressed demand for telephone services promises strong growth
in basic traffic, in contrast to the stagnation experienced in western
markets. But the development plan calls for Dollars 4.2bn in capital
expenditure to the year 2002.
'The Hungarians are asking a lot, asking a high price, high development and
service targets, and not even giving total control,' says Mr Paul Grosse,
Deutsche Telekom's executive director for international finance.
So what is the attraction? Participants note that Matav is the first
telecoms company in eastern Europe to be privatised. Mr Grosse believes that
an early entry may open other markets in the region. Industry analysts point
out that other countries in the region are looking carefully at the
Hungarian experience.
But an acquisition in Hungary probably precludes too much of a commitment to
neighbouring countries. Nor, as industrial investors who entered eastern
Europe in 1990 can attest, is being first always such a boon. Budapest
investment bankers have a motto: 'Pioneers get shot'.
Investors have drawn much attention to Hungary's potential to act as a
regional hub for communications. The theory is that the country in the
region which first establishes modern international connections will attract
traffic and gain a lasting advantage.
Hungary is well-placed for that role, connected to the Trans-European Line
and able to funnel international calls from Romania and Ukraine. Matav has
also beaten its Polish counterpart in providing an optical fibre link
between western Europe and Moscow.
However, there is doubt about regional hubs. As much as anything the theory
was designed to appeal to the Hungarian authorities. Hungary has given up
its territorial claims in the Carpathian basin but still hopes for regional
economic dominance.
Geography does have something to do with Matav's particular appeal to
Telekom. 'Telekom wanted this deal, they wanted Hungary, they wanted a
success in eastern Europe,' says Mr Grosse.
Eastern Europe is a natural hinterland for the German company and Hungary
finds it politically more palatable to see German ownership in a strategic
company than it would Polish or Czech.
Hungary is also sufficiently distant from Germany to give credibility to
Telekom's pledge to develop the country as a regional nexus. But, above all,
the price paid for Matav reflects not so much the company's individual
virtues as the more general uprating of emerging markets and within them the
telecoms sector.
Telecoms investors are betting that at least Poland, the Czech Republic and
Hungary will show some of the economic dynamism that has lifted Latin
America and South-eastern Asia.
Telekom's bid hinges on a projection that Hungary will pull out of its
four-year recession and GDP will grow at an average of 3.5 per cent. With
these assumptions, the price is not so out of line. It implies a valuation
of nearly Dollars 2,000 per line, which is comparable, after adjusting for
inflation, with the price paid in Latin American telecoms privatisations.

purchases

<TEXT>
Mr Sumner Redstone, chairman of cable company Viacom, which is involved in a
takeover battle for Paramount Communications, has issued a strong defence of
controversial purchases of his company's stock in recent months.
The move came on the eve of last night's deadline for final bids in the
Dollars 10bn battle for Paramount.
Mr Redstone's statement appeared designed to reassure the board of Paramount
and Wall Street of the value of Viacom's stock, which is likely to form part
of a revised bid by the company. Viacom is in a bidding war for Paramount
with QVC Network, a television shopping company headed by Mr Barry Diller.
There has been speculation in the US media that the share purchases - some
by a private company owned by Mr Redstone and some by an investment firm in
which he holds a stake - could have helped bolster Viacom's share price.
However, Viacom said that 'rather than inflating the price of Viacom
securities, the more legitimate inquiry is whether the repeated, inaccurate
and misinformed publication of rumours and innuendo has served the agenda of
QVC by damaging the reputation of Viacom's management and by artificially
damaging the market price of Viacom stock.'
The company added that investments in Viacom by Mr Redstone's private
company, National Amusements, had taken place in the period preceding the
announced merger with Paramount and they were part of a well-publicised
market purchase programme which had been in effect for six years.
When there was any likelihood of a successful Paramount deal, National had
suspended all trading activity, and it had made no purchases since August
20, the date of a Viacom-Paramount meeting which led three weeks later to a
merger agreement.
The investment company, WMS Industries, bought stock in Viacom while the
takeover battle was in progress, between September 27 and October 22.
However, Viacom said that neither Mr Redstone nor any of his representatives
'discussed with WMS or had any knowledge whatsoever of WMS's purchases of
Viacom stock or intention to purchase Viacom stock'.
It added: 'Assumptions made by certain members of the press that Mr Redstone
controls or has any influence on the management of WMS are totally
inaccurate.'

with Pratt &amp; Whitney

Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), the aerospace arm of Germany's Daimler-Benz car
group, is reinforcing its partnership in the aircraft engine business
through a cross-equity investment between its MTU engine subsidiary and
Pratt &amp; Whitney, the US aero-engine maker owned by United Technologies.
'The deal is done although there are still some legal issues to be ironed
out,' said Mr Jurgen Schrempp, Dasa's chairman. The equity swap was first
mooted three years ago but little progress had been made.
Pratt &amp; Whitney will take a 24.9 per cent stake in MTU and the German
company will acquire an interest equivalent in value in the US engine maker.
Mr Schrempp said MTU's precise stake in Pratt &amp; Whitney would depend on the
valuation of the companies, which had not yet been completed.
'Pratt is our privileged partner and our joint interests could develop
further. The equity exchange will be a first stage in our alliance,' he
added, implying the cross-holdings could eventually increase.
Dasa has negotiated a series of international alliances since taking over
the leadership and restructuring of the German aerospace industry four years
ago.
After taking control of the Dutch Fokker aircraft maker this year and
merging its helicopter activities with those of Aerospatiale of France, Mr
Schrempp said negotiations to form a partnership in the guided weapons
business with Aerospatiale were advanced. 'We are also moving closer with
the French to merge our two satellite businesses,' he added.
Dasa is also restructuring: Mr Schrempp confirmed the company would shed
16,000 jobs by 1996. Some 5,700 jobs have already been cut this year. Dasa
is also closing six factories, including two commercial aircraft and four
defence facilities, and plans to sell an additional three plants.
The restructuring will produce annual cost savings of DM2bn (Dollars 1.2bn)
by 1996, including DM1.5bn from the job cuts and a further DM500m from other
efficiencies.
This restructuring programme aims to return the company to profit in 1995.
After losing DM341m last year, Mr Schrempp said the company was expected to
show another 'heavy loss' this year. But he said without restructuring
costs, the company would be in profit this year.
Fokker was also expected to show operating losses of about Fl 150m (Dollars
78.5m) before restructuring costs this year.
However, Dasa's activities in the European Airbus programme of which it owns
37.9 per cent, would report 'quite acceptable profits' this year and next.

FT  21 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Flextech in European TCI deal - Company
will be vehicle for future programme expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Flextech, the cable and satellite television group, is on the verge of
completing the purchase of the European programming interests of
Tele-Communications, the largest US cable operator.
Under the deal Flextech, a former oil services company which sold its oil
interests last year to concentrate on the media, will take managerial
control and a variety of stakes in a range of satellite and cable channels.
The purchase will make Flextech the second largest channel operator in the
cable and satellite market behind British Sky Broadcasting, the consortium
in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake.
In return TCI, in the process of being taken over by Bell Atlantic, the US
telephone company, will take a 60 per cent stake in Flextech, at the moment
a company quoted on the Unlisted Securities Market.
The aim is that Flextech will become the vehicle for future TCI programme
expansion in the UK and the rest of Europe.
Under the agreement, which could be announced before Christmas, Flextech is
expected to get from TCI 100 per cent of Bravo, the classic movies channel,
a 25 per cent stake in Children's Channel to add to the 50 per cent it
already holds, 25 per cent in UK Gold, the channel featuring programmes from
the BBC and Thames Television library and 31 per cent in UK Living, the
channel aimed mainly at women.
In addition Flextech will take over United Artists Programming and with it
managerial control of Wire TV and the Parliamentary Channel, two cable only
channels.
The company run by Mr Roger Luard will also have management responsibility
for Discovery, the factual programmes channel and management and
distribution of the Country Music Channel.
As part of the deal Flextech is expected to get more than Pounds 20m in cash
and loans and be able to call on a further sum of around Pounds 15m if
required.
Flextech is emerging as a significant player in the market for cable and
satellite channels although it is at the moment a lossmaker.
In the six months to June 30 the company incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds
3.2m, compared with Pounds 2.91m last year.
In October when Flextech announced it was in talks with TCI its share price
jumped by 49p to 224p. It now stands at 315p with a capitalisation of more
than Pounds 100m, an indication of the current interest in communications
companies.
At the time the company indicated that the deal would put a value of around
Pounds 100m on the assets being acquired.
Once the current deal is formally completed Flextech, an unsuccessful bidder
for an ITV franchise last time, is likely to start looking around for an
investment in ITV.
At the moment it could own no more than 20 per cent because of its satellite
channels although the government is in the process of setting up an
inter-departmental review of the present cross media ownership rules.

FT  21 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Kingfisher moves into office supplies
stores
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kingfisher, the UK retail group, and joint venture partner Staples of the US
will announce this week that they plan to launch nationally the office
supplies superstore concept they have been testing in four locations.
The pilot Staples stores in Swansea, Cambridge, Leeds, and Staples Corner,
north London, have performed above expectations, and the partners have
agreed to invest an undisclosed amount in expanding the chain across the UK.
The 20,000 square feet stores are aimed primarily at small businesses, and
stock 5,000 items of office equipment from cleaning materials and ballpoint
pens through to personal computers and laser printers, at prices up to 50
per cent below traditional dealers.
About half the customers at the pilot stores have been small businesses, and
the other half individuals.
Mr Roger Paffard, UK managing director, claims a small business could save
up to 40 per cent a year on office equipment by buying from Staples.
The chain will open its next store in Birmingham in March, with a further 8
likely next year, and up to 30 in 1995.
Staples of the US pioneered the discount office equipment format opening its
first store in Massachusetts in 1986. It has since opened 175 stores. It
joined forces with Kingfisher to attack the estimated Pounds 1.5bn office
equipment market in the UK last year.
It also has joint ventures in Canada and with Germany's office superstore
chain Maxi-Papier-Markt, in which Kingfisher took a 33 per cent stake this
month.
Staples is the latest example to arrive in the UK of a US-style 'category
killer' - an outlet which aims to offer both a wider range and lower prices
than any competitors in a particular product area. Other examples include
Toys R Us and PC World.
It also borrows some elements, such as a membership scheme - free in this
case - and its focus on small businesses, from the warehouse club concept
like Costco, which opened in Thurrock at the end of last month.

FT  21 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Laporte powder coatings sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOAN GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Laporte, the UK's second largest independent chemicals group, is to dispose
of the powder coatings businesses which it bought as part of its Pounds 129m
takeover of Evode in January.
The company has sold its powder coatings operations in the UK and New
Zealand to HB Fuller of St Paul, Minnesota, US, and its 25 per cent holding
in a powder coatings associate to its partner, Dexter Corporation in the US,
which now owns all the company.
The total consideration for the sale of these businesses, which made an
operating profit of Pounds 1.04m, amounts to approximately Pounds 15.7m.
The disposals are regarded as non-core businesses and 'represent a
substantial advance in selling those interests acquired with Evode which are
not central to Laporte,' said Mr Ken Minton, Laporte chief executive.
Laporte has also completed the sale of a small South African footwear
business, Chamberlain Phipps, for Pounds 1.1m.
It has also bought the Aztec Catalyst Company, based in Cleveland, Ohio,
from Phillips Petroleum for an undisclosed sum. In 1992, Aztec made an
operating profit of Dollars 5.2m (Pounds 3.48m) on sales of Dollars 33m.
Aztec is the third largest supplier of organic peroxides - used in making
PVC, polystyrene and acrylics - in the US. Their manufacture is one of the
main activities of the organic chemicals division, one of five core areas on
which Laporte is focusing.
Laporte intends to invest up to Dollars 8m in Aztec over the next two years
to rebuild manufacturing plant and enhance safety standards.

World Fluids, the specialist chemical and additives manufacturer, is coming
to the market through its reverse takeover by Kells Minerals, the
Dublin-based exploration company.
Kells is paying Pounds 5.5m via the issue of 45.9m shares to Mr John and Ms

The name is to be changed to World Fluids (Holdings).
World Fluids, of which Mr John Marett is managing director, reported pre-tax
profits of Pounds 692,000 for the six months to September 30.

FT  21 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Steel Burrill shares fall after loss of
client
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES UNWIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Following a 20 per cent fall in its share price between December 2 and
December 16 Steel Burrill Jones, the insurance and reinsurance broker,
announced it was losing a client account, writes James Unwin.
In what it admitted was an unusual comment on its day to day business
affairs, SBJ said Pet-Plan would be transferring its business at next
renewal.
Mr Christopher Birrell, SBJ finance director, said the lost account
represented less than 2 per cent of the group's brokerage of between Pounds
44m to Pounds 45m a year and its loss was balanced by the recent gain of a
large marine reinsurance account.
Although the new account was smaller, it was still significant and 'at this
stage in the renewal season it would be incorrect to take this loss in
isolation', he said.

FT  21 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Cost cuts help Merlin reduce loss to Pounds
104,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Merlin International Properties, the property and investment company whose
shares have been suspended since 1991, cut pre-tax losses from Pounds 3.96m
to Pounds 104,000 for the year ended June 30.
Mr Peter Jevans, chairman, said that although results showed a very
significant improvement, last year's figures included trading losses of
Pounds 1.15m from the Trowbridge Shopping Centre development.
The improvement largely arose from reducing the overdraft, containing
overheads, maximising property income, lower interest rates and the ending
of costs in respect of the dispute over the compulsory purchase order issued
on the Deansgate, Manchester, property.
After a three-year battle, the Secretary of State has recently issued his
decision in favour of the group and has quashed the CPO issued in respect of
the Deansgate property.
Until his decision, Mr Jevans said Merlin had been completely 'frustrated'
in its attempts to implement its strategy of a financial reconstruction,
elimination of the overdraft by a share placing and relisting of shares.
Mr Jevans said he looked forward to the very real prospect of being able to
implement Merlin's plans which he believed would ensure a return to
financial stability and the relisting of its shares.
Turnover for the year dropped from Pounds 3.46m to Pounds 2.99m. Net losses
were reduced from Pounds 3.71m to Pounds 232,000, equivalent to 11.1p
(23.8p) per share.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BTR, the industrial conglomerate, has acquired the US Industrial Batteries
business of Gates Energy Products for Dollars 21.4m (Pounds 14m).
The business is a market leader in pure lead battery technology used in
maintenance-free standby batteries for the data processing and
telecommunications industries. It has annual sales of about Dollars 33m and
employs 400 people at its manufacturing plant in Warrensburg, Missouri.
The deal is a further withdrawal from the batteries market for Gates Energy,
which earlier this year sold its nickel-based rechargeable battery business
to Ralston Purina's Eveready Battery company.
Five years ago BTR's subsidiary, Hawker Batteries, bought Gates' plant in
the UK.
Yesterday, Mr John Richardson, head of BTR's batteries group, said he
expected the pure lead battery technology, developed and patented by Gates,
to give BTR a long-term competitive edge.

FT  21 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Ivory &amp; Sime shows 22% advance to Pounds
2.77m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Buoyant stock markets around the world helped Ivory &amp; Sime, the investment
management group, increase pre-tax profits by 22 per cent from Pounds 2.27m
to Pounds 2.77m in the six months to October 31.
The advance was achieved on a 22 per cent rise in turnover from Pounds 6.85m
to Pounds 8.38m.
Mr Gordon Neilly, finance director, said about half the increase in revenue
was due to the recent rise in global stock markets. He added, however, that
Ivory &amp; Sime had been particularly successful in attracting new business
from North America.
This had helped the company to offset the loss of two significant contracts.
These included the termination of the new Frontiers Development Trust, for
which the company received compensation of Pounds 511,000, and the loss of
the Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund. Ivory received Pounds 750,000 for
the termination of the latter account.
Funds under management rose by 13 per cent to Pounds 3.7bn. Since the period
end several smaller contracts had been concluded, bringing total funds to
Pounds 4bn.
Mr Neilly said further progress was expected in the second half, assuming
the global markets remained buoyant.
Administrative costs rose for the first time in four years, from Pounds 4.8m
to Pounds 5.4m.
The dividend was increased by 29 per cent to 2.25p, reflecting the decision
to pay one third at the interim stage and two thirds at the year end. Mr
Neilly said that Ivory &amp; Sime expected to pay a final dividend of at least
4.75p, making a total of 7p (6.5p).
Earnings were 20 per cent higher at 5.9p (4.94p).
The company also announced the appointment of Mr Richard Muckart, who has
been with Ivory since 1983, as an executive director.
Mr Neilly said Mr Muckart's experience in managing portfolios for Ivory &amp;
Sime in emerging markets was the first step in the company's strategy to
increase its presence in these regions.

FT  21 DEC 93 / UK Company News: British Gas strengthens presence in
Argentina
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Gas has bought a 45 per cent share in a Buenos Aires gas-fired power
station for Dollars 24m (Pounds 16.1m) in a move which will strengthen its
already considerable presence in Argentina.
The purchase of a stake in the Central Dock Sud power station fits in with
British Gas's strategy to focus on fast growing economies in which the
company is already involved.
It was made by Global Gas, the division responsible for British Gas's
investments in overseas gas distribution systems and power generation
projects.
Mr Russell Herbert, Global Gas managing director, said the 'market for power
generation in Argentina has major potential for growth . . .'
The company will be involved in the expansion of the plant to 490 megawatts
from its present output of 211MW. It will also act as an adviser in
negotiations for future fuel and power contracts.
A British Gas-led consortium has a 70 per cent shareholding in MetroGas,
which supplies 1.9m customers in Buenos Aires. It also supplies the power
station. Another British Gas division is involved in exploration and
production activities in Argentina.
Power generation schemes using local gas reserves and efficient combined
cycle gas turbines are proving particularly popular in fast growing
economies, in part because they can be built relatively quickly and are much
cheaper than traditional power plants.

FT  21 DEC 93 / UK Company News: BM sale continues restructure programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES UNWIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BM Group, the debt-laden engineering company, has continued its
restructuring with the sale of certain trading assets of Blackwood Hodge
(Canada), its construction equipment distributor, for CDollars 6m (Pounds
3m).
The sale, to Toronto-based Strong Corporation, comprises the business, stock
and certain properties of BHC in Quebec and the Maritime Provinces.
The disposal was part of a programme currently underway which is expected to
fetch about Pounds 40m and eliminate roughly Pounds 24m in associated debt.
It follows an earlier sale of 14 businesses for Pounds 51m.
Buyers for the remainder of the Canadian assets of Blackwood Hodge are being
sought, although BM refused to disclose their value for commercial reasons.
BM acquired Blackwood Hodge's worldwide business for Pounds 54m in 1990.
Last month BM reported a swing from profits of Pounds 34.6m to losses of
Pounds 116.6m pre-tax for the year to June 30 after taking account of
higher-than-expected restructuring provisions and write-downs.

FT  21 DEC 93 / UK Company News: EFM Japan Trust slips
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EFM Japan Trust, which was launched in July 1992 with the aim of providing
long-term capital growth through investment in Japanese equities, had a net
asset value per share of 140.17p at the six months ended November 30.
That compared with 157.55p six months earlier and with 117.58p a year ago.
The 11 per cent fall over the six months compared with a 14 per cent decline
in the Tokyo Stock Exchange First Section Index.
Gross income for the period came to Pounds 43,000 against Pounds 125,000 at
the interim stage last year. After administrative expenses of Pounds 66,000
(Pounds 52,000) and tax Pounds 6,000 (Pounds 12,000), loss retained was
Pounds 29,000 (Pounds 61,000 profit). Losses per share were 0.29p (0.61p
earnings).

FT  21 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Lower interest charges help GGT to Pounds
2.24m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A reduction in interest charges from Pounds 794,000 to Pounds 620,000 after
February's Pounds 14.7m rights issue enabled Gold Greenlees Trott, the
advertising and marketing services group, to show a pre-tax profits advance
from Pounds 2.17m to Pounds 2.24m in the six months to October 31.
Profits at the operating level slipped to Pounds 2.86m (Pounds 2.96m).
Turnover grew 22 per cent to Pounds 127.8m (Pounds 105m).
Group revenue was up 18 per cent at Pounds 25.8m (Pounds 21.9m): though at
constant exchange rates the rise was 6.6 per cent, with the US accounting
for all of the advance.
In the UK, revenues from media advertising declined 15 per cent, though Mr
Matthew Allen, finance director, ascribed that partly to last time's loss of
the Daily Mirror account.
However, across the group's UK businesses the fall was reduced to 5 per cent
by below-the-line activities, where revenues rose by 8 per cent.
Mr Allen said that of the Pounds 14.7m rights money, some Pounds 4.5m had
gone into the joint venture with GGK, the private European agency network,
and that Pounds 3m of medium-term borrowings had been paid down. The balance
was earmarked for acquisition possibilities, probably in the UK.
Earnings per share declined to 6.2p (7.82p) on the increased share capital,
but the interim dividend is held at 3.3p, though last time's has been
adjusted to 3.15p for the scrip element of the rights.

FT  21 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Pantheon seeks Pounds 33.2m for purchases
and to repay debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pantheon International Participations, the investment trust, yesterday
announced plans to fund acquisitions and reduce debt through a Pounds 33.2m
open offer and placing of ordinary stock units.
The proceeds will be used to acquire venture capital interests with a net
asset value of Pounds 11.3m and to redeem Pounds 7.5m of loan stock by
making a payment of about Pounds 5.7m.
Mr Rhoddy Swire, group managing director, said the balance would be used to
strengthen Pantheon as 'Europe's largest investor in capital funds'.
The company is offering 16.67m units at 200p each to shareholders on the
basis of one unit for one share held. Of the offer 4.4m units will be placed
with institutions.
The shares rose 11p to close at 203p.
The company is also issuing warrants, giving investors the right to exercise
share options at a price of 250p between 1996 and 2001. Subscribers would
receive one warrant for every five ordinary stock units. If all the warrants
were exercised after 1996, it would result in the issue of 6.79m additional
ordinary shares.
The capital will be raised in three instalments: the first 80p on
application; a second 60p payable on July 8 next year; and the final 60p in
January 1995, after which the units convert into ordinary shares.
Pantheon decided to issue stock units rather than ordinary shares because it
wanted to stagger the injection of funds. It was reluctant to have large
funds on deposit while it pursued suitable investment opportunities, Mr
Swire said.
He expected most of those opportunities to arise in the US, where the trust
has established a diversified portfolio of holdings in venture capital
funds.
The success of that strategy was underlined earlier this year when industry
analysts ranked Pantheon as one of the leading non-split capital investment
trusts - those investing solely for capital growth - in the year to June
1993.
In that period it recorded a rise of 44 per cent in net asset values.
Although the main aim of the offer was to expand Pantheon's investment
portfolio, Mr Swire said a strengthened balance sheet would also enable it
to redeem loan stock owed to the National Rivers Authority as part of the
1989 purchase of Pounds 20m in unquoted assets from the water authorities.
The outstanding loan stock is valued at Pounds 7.5m, but Pantheon will pay
Pounds 5.63m following a 25 per cent discount agreement arranged with the
NRA.

FT  21 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Granada turns up heat on LWT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Granada Group turned up the heat in its Pounds 654m aggressive offer for LWT
Holdings, describing the London weekend TV company's defence, posted on
Sunday, as an 'empty document' which 'failed to add anything serious to the
debate'. The bid is the first hostile one in the history of British
commercial television.
LWT's shares rose 6p to 605p yesterday, while Granada's were up 7p at 527p.
That makes the six-for-five share offer worth 632.4p a share. There is a
cash alternative at 528p.
Mr Gerry Robinson, chief executive of Granada, said the defence document did
not address the fundamental question of how LWT will provide long term
earnings growth to its shareholders.
He suggested the price being offered by Granada - of 32 times 1992 earnings
per share and 25 times estimates for 1993 earnings - could not be supported
by fundamental analysis.
He has said the bid, if successful, would not dilute Granada's earnings in
the financial year to September 1995.
LWT's defence document demonstrated that its shares had performed far better
for investors than Granada's had over the last four years, and said half of
Granada's profits came from its low growth television rental business.
Sir Christopher Bland, chairman of LWT, said on Sunday that it was pursuing
talks which could result in a four-way alliance between LWT, Yorkshire,
Tyne-Tees and Anglia producing cost savings, although current broadcasting
regulations only allow two licences to be combined in one company.
Mr Robinson said LWT shareholders should ask how a merger with Yorkshire
would affect its earnings, how LWT would protect its market share if it
remained independent and what would happen to the LWT share price if the bid
failed.

FT  21 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Proudfoot facing up to Pounds 5m bill for
job losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Proudfoot, the management consultancy chaired by Lord Stevens, is expected
to take a charge this year of between Pounds 3m and Pounds 5m to pay for a
wide-ranging redundancy programme announced yesterday.
This will be in addition to provisions of Pounds 1.6m announced in September
to pay for a rationalisation programme expected to result in savings of
Pounds 15m. The announcement also follows a series of senior departures and
rumours of an attempt at a boardroom coup to remove Lord Stevens.
Some 200 jobs are to be cut by the first quarter of next year, bringing the
group's staff to about 850. This is expected to bring further savings of
between Pounds 10m and Pounds 15m.
Mr David Gill, who was appointed finance director in May following the
departure of Mr Neil Hamilton, denied that the rationalisation was in
response to outside pressure. 'We believe this is the structure necessary to
reflect the business volumes we are currently experiencing,' he said.
Mr Gill also rejected suggestions that the company was seeking to sell its
European operations. 'We are in the process of rejuvenating the company
worldwide, with particular emphasis on the European region,' he said.
Mr Gill said Proudfoot was 'not taking seriously' reports of a possible bid
from former employees.
The shares have fallen from 398p last year to close 2p higher at 65p
yesterday.

FT  21 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Keeping France in the picture - Gooding
Consumer Electronics' latest buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Behind the rescue of the Grundig television factory in north-east France by
Gooding Consumer Electronics is a gamble. It is an attempt by the Welsh
company to become a European volume manufacturer of low-cost sets, competing
directly with east Asian imports in a market where profitability is under
heavy pressure.
In a deal announced last week, the newly-formed Gooding Consumer Electronics
has acquired the Grundig factory at Creutzwald, in the Moselle region, for
FFr160m (Pounds 18.28m) with an additional French government grant of
FFr50m.
The German consumer electronics company, and Philips, the Dutch group which
has management control of it, announced last January that production would
be switched from Creutzwald at the end of this month.
As part of last week's deal, the factory will continue to make sets for
Grundig until the end of 1994, which will allow the Welsh company time to
introduce its own design for sets at a lower end of the market. It believes
it can increase production from the annual capacity of 500,000 to 1m within
three years.
Gooding Consumer Electronics is jointly owned by Mr Alfred Gooding, a
61-year-old Welsh entrepreneur whose family holding company, Gooding
Investments, is the majority shareholder, and Mr Koen van Driel, a Dutchman
who is a former managing director of Grundig UK.
Mr Gooding, who sold the steel components maker, Catnic, for Pounds 15m in
1983, is chairman of Gooding Sanken, a company he set up in south Wales with
Sanken Electric of Japan to make power supply units, and of Race
Electronics, a contract manufacturer also based in south Wales.
Among other things, Race makes 10,000 satellite television receivers a week
for retailers such as Dixons, Currys and Comet. The new scheme is to put
together a package of receivers and sets to sell either under store brands
or under the brand names Minerva, acquired from Grundig, and Continental
Edison, bought from Thomson of France.
'What I'm trying to do is put together a very substantial
electronics-orientated business,' Mr Gooding said. 'We're putting together a
group that in 1994 could move into something like Pounds 130m turnover.'
South Wales is known as a base for the production of Sony and Panasonic
televisions, but Gooding Consumer Electronics will manufacture in France
rather than Wales because a high-quality, recently modernised, factory was
available at a highly discounted price.
'It would have cost me three times that amount of money, maybe four times,
to put in the same plant, with the same guaranteed workload for a year and
with a trained workforce of 350 people,' Mr Gooding said.
'None of this is being done at the expense of what I do in south Wales. In
fact it is complementary - we will be able to go to the big store groups
with satellite receivers and TVs which are all in the same family.'
There was a big market in Europe, he said, for low-cost 14in to 21in
televisions. 'At present, the bulk of those type of sets are imported from
east Asia. I know that with modern sophisticated equipment, with a
well-managed labour force, we can compete head-on with east Asia, which has
to ship the stuff half way round the world.
'We've already spoken to big store chains like Dixons. There is no doubt
that if we can come up with a competitive product, they won't think twice
about buying a European set.'
Part of the appeal of the Creutzwald factory, he added, was that it was in a
coal mining region similar to south Wales.
'People in a mining area have a work ethic - they are prepared to work
shifts, they're prepared to be flexible. The labour force there have made it
quite clear they are right behind me to protect jobs in this factory.'

FT  21 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Flurry in share price prompts TSB statement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TSB Group last night indicated that it had abandoned attempts to sell its
merchant banking and fund management subsidiary Hill Samuel after failing to
attract the price which senior executives had required.
TSB issued a statement saying that Hill Samuel was 'not for sale' after
strong activity in its shares was prompted by a report that it intended to
keep Hill Samuel, and separate speculation that it might become a takeover
target.
Mr Peter Ellwood, chief executive, said Hill Samuel was 'an important part
of the TSB Group, and we are investing in its future'. He said he had issued
a statement to clarify the question of ownership after 'speculation in the
press'.
The activity came after a report in The Sunday Telegraph which said TSB had
decided to hold on to Hill Samuel under its new management after
unsuccessful discussions with potential purchasers held by its adviser
Morgan Stanley.
TSB never said publicly that Hill Samuel was for sale, but Sir Nicholas
Goodison, TSB chairman, indicated last year that it would accept an offer
that benefited shareholders.
The bank originally wanted to divest Hill Samuel, which made substantial
losses from poor commercial lending in the 1980s, because of its strategy of
concentrating on retail banking and insurance businesses.
However, Hill Samuel is thought to have performed well this year after its
poor loans were transferred to a separate 'loan administration unit' holding
Pounds 1.6bn of net debt. Its continuing business made a Pounds 53m interim
profit.
Although TSB is thought to have considered selling the Hill Samuel
Investment Management Group separately, executives were wary about allowing
a buyer to take the more valuable parts of the business while rejecting
others.
TSB shares ended the day 7p higher at 257p. The statement was issued after
the London market had closed.

FT  21 DEC 93 / ABB man to lead new Volvo board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading Volvo shareholders, which forced the Swedish carmaker earlier this
month to abandon its planned merger with Renault of France, have agreed on
the composition of a new board.
Institutions yesterday proposed a seven-man board to be chaired by Mr
Bert-Olof Svanholm, chief executive of the Swedish operations of Asea Brown
Boveri, the leading European electrical engineering group. He is chairman of
the Swedish Engineering Industries association and vice-chairman of the
Federation of Swedish Industries.
Nominations, to be proposed at a shareholders' meeting on January 19,
preserve a balance between the two main power blocs in corporate Sweden,
represented by Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken and the Wallenberg interests
and by Svenska Handelsbanken.
Other proposed board members include Mr Tom Hedelius, chairman of
Handelsbanken, and Mr Per-Olof Ericsson, president of Sandvik, the
engineering group and also a member of the Handelsbanken board.
Mr Svanholm comes from the Wallenberg sphere. He is also a member of the
board of Atlas Copco, the engineering group and a key Wallenberg company. He
will be joined on the Volvo board by Mr Bjorn Svedberg, president of SE
Banken and a board member of Wallenberg companies including Ericsson and
Stora.
The institutions are also proposing Mr Hakan Frisinger, a former president
of both the Volvo group and of the Volvo car operations, who emerged as an
outspoken opponent of the planned merger with Renault, as well as Mr Soren
Gyll, president of Volvo.
The board will be completed by Mr Louis Schweitzer, chairman and chief
executive of Renault - the biggest single shareholder in Volvo with 10 per
cent of the votes. Mr Schweitzer was one of the architects of the failed
merger, along with Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, and is the only foreigner proposed.
Under the leadership of Mr Gyllenhammar, Volvo had fought hard to remain
apart from the Swedish financial establishment and to maintain its
independence from single-owner groups. Institutions, which have more than 40
per cent of the votes, are seeking to bring the carmaker into the mainstream
of the Swedish corporate and financial establishment.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Bank moves to ease money market difficulties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England is proposing to broaden the scope of its money market
operations to help overcome the liquidity problems which have dogged the
City since Black Wednesday.
The proposed changes, involving the sale and repurchase of UK government
bonds, should reduce the volatility of short-term interest rates. Overnight
rates have ranged from about 4.5 per cent to well over 10 per cent,
according to the Bank.
The new arrangements could pave the way for an 'open repo' system for gilts,
enabling investors to lend their holdings in the same way that holders of US
Treasury, French and German government debt can do. The Bank plans to
introduce the new arrangements in early 1994.
Following the crisis in September 1992 when the Bank had to intervene
heavily to support sterling, the money market has suffered from a lack of
liquidity. The Bank was forced to introduce temporary facilities to provide
liquidity to the banking system, allowing the ad hoc sale and repurchase of
gilts.
'The scale of the Bank's money market operations has remained large and it
seems likely that facilities of the kind provided since September 1992 will
continue to be needed for the foreseeable future. The Bank proposes
therefore to make them a systematic component of its money market
operations,' says the central bank in its document.
The Bank has decided to make these repo facilities available on a regular
fortnightly timetable, with funds provided through the purchase and resale
of UK government debt denominated in sterling or other currencies. It also
proposes to widen the range of participants to allow all banks, building
societies and gilt-edged marketmakers (Gemms) to act as counterparties.
Previously, only the top banks and building societies, as well as the Gemms,
were allowed to do so.
'This move will dramatically reduce the volatility of the overnight interest
rates,' said a money market specialist at a big clearing bank. Banks should
have a much clearer idea of their short-term funding costs as a result.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Burton gives chief executive 60% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Hoerner, chief executive of fashion retail group Burton, enjoyed a
pay increase of at least 60 per cent to Pounds 624,000 for the year to
August, according to the annual report published yesterday.
Mr Hoerner, an American who became chief executive in February 1992, has won
praise in the City for turning Burton around after its profits collapse of
the early 1990s, but his pay increase may raise some eyebrows.
Part of the explanation is his decision not to take a pay rise when
appointed chief executive, but to respect a group-wide pay freeze. That
means for the year to August 1992 he was not the group's highest-paid
director - shown in the accounts to have earned Pounds 357,000 plus
performance-related payments of Pounds 35,000.
Mr Hoerner is thought to have earned about Pounds 325,000 that year,
although the size of his bonus is unknown.
He decided to take his entitlement last year, however, and received total
pay of Pounds 453,000, plus performance related payments of Pounds 171,000.
In the same year, Burton transformed an Pounds 800,000 loss into an Pounds
18.5m profit.
But Mr Hoerner has some distance to go to match former Burton chairman Sir
Ralph Halpern, whose total pay peaked at Pounds 1.36m in 1987, before
tailing off to Pounds 640,000 in 1990. He also lags behind compatriot Mr
David Dworkin, who carried out a similar rescue mission at Storehouse before
returning to the US in February, shortly after receiving a Pounds 2.7m bonus
on top of total pay of Pounds 575,000.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Unilever ice cream empire grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products group, is set to become
France's largest ice cream producer by taking control of Ortiz-Miko, a
family-run frozen foods manufacturer, in a deal valued at Pounds 220m.
The move will give Unilever about a third of the French ice cream market and
strengthen it in the food service business.
France is the only large European country in which Unilever, the world's
biggest ice cream maker, is not market leader. The deal will put it ahead of
Nestle, of Switzerland, which has about a quarter of the French market.
Ortiz-Miko has about 18 per cent of the French market, where its main brand
is Miko. It also has ice cream businesses in Germany and Belgium with
combined annual sales of more than FFr600m (Pounds 68m).
The company is particularly strong in 'impulse' ice creams, sold through
small retail outlets, which are the fastest growing part of the market. It
complements Unilever's French ice cream business, which mainly sells bulk
packs to supermarkets.
The deal entails Unilever buying 75 per cent of Safral, a family-owned
holding company which owns 85 per cent of Ortiz-Miko. Unilever plans a
public offer, to be launched by Rothschild et Cie, for the remaining 15 per
cent of Ortiz-Miko shares, which are quoted on the Paris stock exchange.
Vivagel, Ortiz-Miko's consumer frozen foods business, will be sold to BSN,
France's biggest food manufacturer, for FFr350m.
Ortiz-Miko has 6,000 employees and had sales last year of FFr5.3bn. About
FFr700m of that was accounted for by Vivagel.
Unilever will keep Ortiz-Miko's distribution network and its foods service
division, which sells more than FFr2bn of frozen foods annually to
institutional and restaurant customers.
Recession, fierce competition in the French grocery business and heavy
investments in a new ice cream plant and in marketing have depressed
Ortiz-Miko's recent financial performance. Last year, net profit fell to
FFr12.7m from FFr53.5m in 1991.
The deal, in which BSN played an important behind-the-scenes role, will be a
disappointment to Nestle. The Swiss group has also been expanding in ice
cream and last year worked closely with BSN to take over Perrier, France's
biggest mineral water producer.
Unilever earlier this year formed a joint venture with BSN to make and
market products worldwide combining ice cream and yoghurt, of which the
French company is the world's largest manufacturer.
The takeover of Ortiz-Miko will require approval by the Brussels competition
authorities, which are investigating allegations that Unilever has
restricted competition in ice cream by excluding rival brands from the
freezer cabinets it supplies to retailers.
The Ortiz family, which founded Ortiz-Miko in 1921, will retain 25 per cent
of Safral. The Unilever deal excludes Safral's interests in smoked salmon,
vegetables, fish and Spanish ice cream and frozen foods.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Russia breaches diamond deal with De Beers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian government, desperate for hard currency, is selling uncut gem
diamonds from its Treasury stockpile directly to dealers in Antwerp in clear
breach of its agreement with De Beers, the South African group which
controls more than 80 per cent of the world's rough, or uncut, diamond
market.
Between Dollars 40m and Dollars 80m of diamonds had been 'leaked' to the
west in the past two weeks, Mr Gary Ralfe, a De Beers director, suggested
yesterday.
The Russian problem emerged at the end of a record year for the Central
Selling Organisation, De Beers' London-based offshoot that organises the
international diamond cartel. The CSO reported yesterday that its rough
diamond sales reached Dollars 4.355bn (Pounds 2.91bn) in 1993, 28 per cent
higher than last year's total and 5 per cent above the previous record in
1988.
The former Soviet Union re-joined the diamond cartel in 1990, giving the CSO
exclusive rights to sell 95 per cent of its production for five years. At
the same time, De Beers advanced the government a Dollars 1bn loan and
shipped some of the Soviet diamond stockpiles to London as collateral. After
the break-up of the Soviet Union, Russia agreed to continue the accord.
The international diamond market relies on De Beers to even out the peaks
and troughs in demand via the cartel - a system it calls single-channel
marketing.
Mr Ralfe said he had made it clear during a meeting with a senior Russian
official at the weekend that any large-scale leakage of gem diamonds would
destabilise the diamond market. 'I urged the Russians not to damage the
long-term benefits of single-channel marketing for short-term gain,' said Mr
Ralfe.
The official - whom Mr Ralfe refused to identify - said great care was being
taken not to undermine the market and said the diamonds were not not being
sold at cut prices.
Mr Ralfe said the sale of a second category of rough diamonds, from Russia's
strategic defence stockpile, had been 'worrisome' for De Beers this year.
These stones were outside the marketing deal because at the time they were
stockpiled they were non-gems for industrial and technical use. However,
many had now been cut in India where an ability to polish, economically,
very small stones, has been developed over the past 20 years.
The US was also selling diamonds from its strategic stockpile and this was
causing 'some signs of oversupply in the lower and cheaper quality range of
rough diamonds,' said Mr Ralfe.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Europe must lower rates, says OECD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Continental European countries must take every opportunity to lower interest
rates in order to boost their economies and combat unemployment, the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development urged yesterday.
Mr Kumiharu Shigehara, the head of the OECD's economics and statistics
department, told a press conference that insufficient growth had been
fuelling a continuing rise in unemployment in Europe that is expected to
result in 22m Europeans, or 11.5 per cent of the region's labour force,
being unemployed next year.
He acknowledged that Germany had lowered interest rates steadily since
September 1992, and that other members of the European exchange rate
mechanism had also been able to lower rates. 'Nevertheless short-term
interest rates in these countries are high relative to inflation,' said Mr
Shigehara. 'Prospects for a decline in German inflation appear favourable
and any room for easing monetary conditions further without undermining the
credibility of policy should be used fully.'
The OECD's latest half-yearly economic outlook, published yesterday,
forecasts divergent business conditions in leading industrialised countries
next year.
While the US, Canada and Britain are recovering from recession and expected
to experience faster growth, the OECD believes Japan's economy is still very
weak and that a slow recovery there is only likely to begin in the first
quarter of next year.
The OECD expects that Germany's economy will contract at an annual rate of
0.6 per cent in the first half of next year as weak exports hold down
output, but will recover to show real growth of about 0.8 per cent next
year.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Abu Dhabi may take action against BCC: Dollars 7bn claim
would cut pay-outs to other creditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government of Abu Dhabi is considering suing the collapsed Bank of
Credit and Commerce International in an action that, if successful, would
substantially reduce pay-outs to the bank's other hundreds of thousands of
creditors.
It is also preparing legal claims against the network of 20 or more
independent intermediary banks through which its Dollars 2.6bn of allegedly
misappropriated money was channelled by BCCI.
The details emerged as the Department of Private Affairs in Abu Dhabi,
majority shareholder in the bank, launched a Dollars 7bn civil action in the
local courts against 13 former executives of the bank.
Mr David Sandy, a partner with Simmons &amp; Simmons, Abu Dhabi's lawyers in
London, said: 'We hope it won't come down to (suing BCCI) but that is one of
the options.'
He said Abu Dhabi could sue BCCI for Dollars 7bn, which would rank alongside
the existing creditors' claims on the bank. It might also have a priority
claim for breach of trust for Dollars 1.6bn misappropriated which would rank
ahead of other creditors.
The claim may occur if Abu Dhabi is unable to agree a new settlement with
the liquidators to BCCI to stave off litigation. The previous proposals were
rejected by the Luxembourg appeals court earlier this year.
Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, Abu Dhabi's ruler, and Crown Prince
Khalifa claim they entrusted Dollars 2.6bn throughout the 1980s to BCCI for
a portfolio of investments. They recovered about Dollars 600m, including
Dollars 150m left when BCCI was closed by regulators in July 1991. The
remainder of yesterday's Dollars 7bn claim represents what its advisers say
would have been the value of the portfolio had it been legitimately and
conservatively invested.
While BCCI provided regular statements suggesting the money was being safely
held and appreciating in value, they claim it was being transferred secretly
to BCCI subsidiaries around the world to support delinquent loans and
bolster losses.
Mr Sandy said that a case was being prepared against other banks which would
allow disclosure of documents.

The LWT defence document contains the kind of good knockabout stuff that
keeps shareholders amused and merchant bankers in lucrative employment. The
use of highly selective charts accentuates LWT's fine record while
diminishing Granada's achievements. It nevertheless lands some telling blows
about the underlying prospects for some of Granada's businesses.
One of LWT's more substantive arguments is that the UK is about to
experience the same media explosion which has already shattered the US
scene. In the fast-developing - if ill-defined - world of multi-media,
companies which can create intellectual property and boast a library of
existing 'software' will become increasingly valuable. This is highlighted
by the current bid for Paramount, where QVC and Viacom are both prepared to
pay about 40 times historic earnings to secure a rare film production
company with an international distribution network. The S&amp;P broadcast media
index has strongly outperformed this year as a result of such excitement.
Parallels can be drawn with the UK. The proliferation of media channels will
surely increase the value of television programmes; LWT is one of the more
imaginative producers. But LWT is no Paramount. Nor is it the case that the
UK market has neglected the value of media stocks: they are already the most
highly rated of UK consumer companies. Despite the diversions of
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, Granada's bid still seems likely to shake down to a
question of price. At 30 times LWT's earnings, Granada's offer is not
demonstrably cheap.

FT  21 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: British Steel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In marking British Steel down by 6 per cent, the market has given the thumbs
down to the new European steel agreement. It may be right to do so, despite
considerable uncertainty over how the deal will actually affect prices.
Hopes of a solution to the European over-capacity problem have helped the
shares more than double this year. Now those inclined to put on a brave face
argue that even a fudged agreement is better than no agreement at all. At
least the European industry's collective determination, which has helped
recent price rises to stick, should continue. The self-help scheme will
remove capacity despite the lenient treatment of Ekostahl and Ilva, and
discipline has been imposed, albeit only in theory, on state subsidies.
Yet it is difficult to believe that prices - which are still well below
their pre-recession peak - will be as well supported next year as they would
have been with a tougher line from Brussels. The grudging EU agreement means
negotiations on private sector capacity reduction may be tortuous and
protracted. With no real prospect of volume increase in Europe next year,
British Steel could face increasing competition in its relatively buoyant
home market.
If that calls for a more sceptical view of 1994 than hitherto, medium-term
expectations must be scaled back too. The industry's self-imposed price
discipline works only because demand is depressed. It will be harder to
enforce in an economic recovery, when there will also be less incentive for
capacity reduction. British Steel's chances of matching its peak profits of
Pounds 733m in 1989-90 remain elusive.

The acquisition of a French ice-cream business for FFr1.9bn has all the
hallmarks of a model Unilever deal. The Anglo-Dutch group has been stalking
the privately-controlled Ortiz-Miko for years, waiting for the opportunity
to prise it free. The addition of the business will hardly transform
Unilever's prospects but it will usefully strengthen its presence in the
weakest of its main European markets, enabling it to leapfrog Nestle' in the
process. Unilever can easily afford the diversion of cash flow. The price
seems fair for such a strategic nugget.
The acquisition will also serve a broader aim, helping Unilever centralise
its European ice-cream production while strengthening its local distribution
network. Unilever is now clearly intent on concentrating its resources on
product areas of greatest strength. The acquisition of Kraft's ice-cream
business in the US in September betrayed similar purpose.
The intriguing aspect to the Ortiz-Miko deal is BSN's presumed involvement
as an asset broker. The French group will now walk away with a desirable
prepared meals business. Such asset swaps are likely to become an
increasingly common feature of the European food industry as companies seek
to dominate discrete market segments. That, though, will doubtless excite
the interest of the Brussels competition authorities. Given Unilever's
existing grip on the European ice-cream market, it would be perfectly
justified to take a closer look.

FT  21 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Savings grace
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The sharp upward revision of the second-quarter savings rate in yesterday's
UK GDP is good news for those worried about the economy's ability to
withstand tax increases next year. Since the previous second-quarter
estimate of 10.1 has been replaced with one of 11.7, the government's
expectations that it will fall in 1994, which were factored into its budget
forecasts, look more plausible. Moreover, the higher ratio has come about
not because consumers were spending less than previously thought, but more
because estimates of personal income have risen.
Admittedly, the scale of the revisions, which have also seen a jump in the
first-quarter savings ratio, mean it is risky to set too much store by its
absolute level. The encouraging fall of the ratio to 10.6 per cent in the
third quarter may prove illusory if that figure too is revised in due
course. But the ratio does now have room to fall by the 1.5 percentage
points or so needed to offset next year's tax increases without hitting
levels unprecedented even in the low inflationary 1960s.
Higher employment levels, at least in the service sector, may help boost
personal incomes next year. That in turn could boost consumer confidence,
even though job worries are still a dampener at present. There are also
incipient signs that lower interest rates are encouraging consumers to
borrow more on credit cards. If that continues, fiscal tightening may not be
too painful after all.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Leading Article: OECD pulls its punches
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The economic cycle has its ups and down but so do the lives of international
economic officials. Last week, the atmosphere in Geneva was one of heady
excitement at the conclusion to the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations.
Yesterday, life returned to normal as the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development published its half-yearly short-term outlook
for the economies of the industrialised world.
The OECD's latest outlook is not one of its better productions. The language
of international bureaucracy is never particularly inspiring. And the OECD's
numerical projections are barely worth studying, given the OECD's atrocious
forecasting record in recent years. Moreover, as the report acknowledges at
the beginning but then does not discuss further, the biggest challenges
facing the main industrialised economies are not to do with short-term
macroeconomic management.
The OECD is at its best when producing thorough and prescriptive analyses of
structural issues. And the need to find ways to tackle persistent
unemployment or over-stretched welfare systems is the main current
preoccupation of governments everywhere. But these issues barely rate a
mention.
The OECD's difficulty with short-term analysis is that political
sensitivities make it hard for the organisation to do more than spell out
the options that governments face and the risks ahead. As long as the advice
is kept relatively broad and consensus-based - the need to remain vigilant
in the fight against inflation or to reduce structural fiscal deficits -
than all is well. But translating these general aims into policy
prescription is much more difficult.
Promising recovery
The US is a case in point. Many US economists publicly, and OECD economists
privately, are already getting itchy about the need for a rise in America's
currently low short-term interest rates as an increasingly promising
recovery takes root. Yes, inflation is also low - as President Clinton
pointed out last week in an attempt to pre-empt a rate rise. But as Federal
Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan will well understand, by the time inflation
starts to accelerate it is already to late to start tightening policy.
Yet there are also risks in an early tightening. For, as the OECD points
out, the debt-based difficulties that the US, Japan and most of the
English-speaking developed world have suffered recently make it possible
that consumers will respond only slowly to signs of increased prosperity,
especially in countries such as the US or Britain where there are tax
increases in the pipeline. The solution for the US is almost certainly to
leave the decision to Mr Greenspan, whose recent record has been impressive.
That, given its support for independent central banks and the absence of
direct advice in the report, must be the OECD's preferred solution.
Deepening recession
Nor is the OECD any more forthcoming when discussing the other short-term
dilemmas facing developed country finance ministers. Japan's deepening
recession looks increasingly like a credit crunch, as the OECD report
acknowledges, with the implication that neither even lower interest rates
nor more public investment are likely to help much. But although the Outlook
rightly points out the evidence that banks are not lending to credit-worthy
customers, it stops short of discussing the kind of publicly financed
recapitalisation of the banking sector that the Japanese economy now needs.
In Europe, the OECD does a good job of outlining the options. Most
indicators of the stance of German monetary policy suggest that it is too
tight - but wage inflationary pressures persist. Unless German interest
rates fall fast enough, the economic costs for France of trying to maintain
a tight link between the Franc and the D-Mark risk becoming unsustainably
high. The OECD report, while setting out the risks and benefits for France
in cutting short rates below Germany's, ends up still sitting on the fence.
Yet this Economic Outlook is not a waste of time. Given the OECD's
forecasting record, it would be easy to dismiss any short-term advice. But
by laying out the issues while avoiding detailed prescription, the OECD adds
to the sum of economic understanding. Better still, it should drop the
forecasts entirely.

While on the subject of opinion polls, anyone idly repeating the myth that
Germans behave arrogantly should think again. One of Germany's leading
pollsters - Infas - has just discovered that 78 per cent of Germans think
the world would not be a better place if everyone was like the Germans; 21
per cent thought it would be.

Let's hope 1994 proves to be a more memorable year for some US citizens than
the one now ending. According to a opinion poll just published, the most
memorable event of 1993 was not the Clinton inauguration, nor sadness over
the troops lost in Somalia, nor even the third consecutive National
Basketball Association championship win by the Chicago Bulls. Instead, what
stuck most in the mind of the 1,000 people polled was 'falling interest
rates'.
But then the nature of the survey's sponsor - MasterCard International - may
have had something to do with its outcome.

Alarmed by the recent turn of events in Russia, the organisers of a British
school party about to take the St Petersburg-to-Moscow train, contacted the
travel advice unit at the Foreign Office. It replied that while it could not
accept liability for injury, loss or damage arising from its advice, it did
recommend that train travellers secure the door of their compartments with
'wire or strong cord'.
Back at the school, the teachers are anxious to prevent the secret leaking
out to some of their more unruly pupils. If it does, 'they'll all want to
go,' says one nervous organiser.

What better symbol of the yawning gap between commercial and investment
banks? Having reported that Goldman Sachs' partners are each to get a
Dollars 5m share of the profits this year, Chase Manhattan, the
Rockefellers' old family bank, has just announced its Christmas bonus.
It is celebrating its profits recovery by awarding its employees an extra
day off work next year and Dollars 300 extra pocket money. Admittedly,
Chase's largesse is spread around all of its 34,000 employees and not just
confined to 161 fat cats, as is the case with Goldman. Even so, Chase is
only handing out the equivalent of two Goldman partners' bonuses.

Speaking of Portillo, the young Thatcherite standard-bearer has easily won
this year's prize for the most imaginative ministerial Christmas card.
Harking back to his Spanish ancestry, Portillo's greeting depicts a Garland
cartoon of a Spanish bullfight. The chief secretary is the matador,
clutching a cape emblazoned with spending cuts and a sword with tax rises.
The badly-wounded bull, of course, is the government's borrowing
requirement.

It may be the season of goodwill but Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, and Michael Portillo, chief secretary of the Treasury, still seem
no closer to settling their inter-departmental row over the issue of angling
licences.
Portillo is blocking a move by the prezza to allow post offices to sell
licences to the nation's anglers because he doesn't think a state monopoly
should be allowed to undercut the private sector tackle shops which sell the
licences alongside rods, nets and maggots. A furious Hezza has responded by
telling the cabinet's rising star to get his hook 'off my line'.
Portillo is prepared to negotiate. If Hezza's department drops its
opposition to privatisation of the post office, then Portillo will happily
accept a liberalisation of the market in angling licences. Cheeky.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The brashly ebullient Heinz Schimmelbusch, ousted from his perch at
Metallgesellschaft, was always something of an anomaly on the German
industrial scene. No surprises, then, that Karl-Josef ('Kajo') Neukirchen,
the man installed last Friday as the new chief executive at the troubled
company, is cast in a rather different mould.
A tough, no-nonsense hatchet-man blessed with film star good looks,
Neukirchen's cool reserve presumably appeals rather more to the all-powerful
big banks when it comes to sorting out intractable corporate problems.
Recessionary times have been good to the 51-year-old company doctor who
first made his mark in 1987-88 when he was spirited in to clear up the
problems at engineering group Klockner-Humboldt-Deutz. He put the company
back on its feet, one in four workers lost their jobs, and he moved on to
Hoesch in 1991.
There he lasted only until the following summer, as the steelmaker fell
victim to rivals Krupp in one of Germany's extremely rare hostile takeovers.
But he walked away with a multi-million pay-off.
Since then, the physics and business graduate from Bonn has picked up
chairmanships of the supervisory boards of both FAG Kugelfischer and the
ailing Klockner-Werke. At the former, he has once again demonstrated his
willingness to take unpleasant decisions swiftly - nearly half the workers
have gone amid one of the most drastic restructurings of 1993.
Yesterday he was back in executive mode at Metallgesellschaft's Frankfurt
headquarters where the atmosphere must be anything but festive.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Leading Article: When a system breaks down
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For all its well-deserved reputation for taking industry seriously, Germany
offers a surprisingly large number of case studies where various failures of
management supervision have led to highly-publicised corporate losses or
even, in extreme cases, financial collapse. The list of well-known companies
which during the last 10 or 15 years have been dealt severe blows through
spectacular incapacity to exert proper control over aspects of their
business include AEG, Nixdorf, Grundig, Krupp, Kloeckner &amp; Co and
Volkswagen. Metallgesellschaft, the Frankfurt-based metals and industrial
group, whose chief executive was forced to resign on Friday, has now become
the latest example of a high profile company falling prey to misguided
decisions.
Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, an outspoken Austrian who was elected Germany's
manager of the year in 1991, led Metallgesellschaft's energetic and
generally well-regarded moves into new business areas in recent years. He
was dismissed after failing to keep his supervisory board informed of
problems at the group's US trading subsidiary, losses at which have been
large enough to have created a group liquidity crisis.
On one level, the story of Mr Schimmelbusch's fall from grace demonstrates
little more than that, in any capitalist economy, charismatic chief
executives sporadically fly too close to the sun. On another level, however,
the Metallgesellschaft case offers insights into the strengths and
weaknesses of Germany's system of corporate governance.
Shareholder pressure
German companies' dependence on stock market finance is relatively low, even
though they are slowly becoming more sensitive to shareholder pressure, not
least because of the need to turn to foreign investors for a greater
proportion of their funds. As a result of the commensurately low influence
of shareholders, Germany's supervisory boards - comprising representatives
of shareholders and labour - have a disproportionately large responsibility
for ensuring that management makes the right decisions. In many cases,
supervisory boards can exert a positive influence by providing companies
with a favourable environment for long-term planning. In particular,
companies are protected from the need to pay undue attention to short-term
stock market fluctuations and to the threat of hostile takeovers. However,
there is a danger that the system, by drawing supervisory boards into too
close and trusting a relationship with management, can offer executive
boards an imprudent amount of decision-making leeway. German style
supervision can shield companies from the discipline that would otherwise be
exerted by financial markets.
Lines of communication
Metallgesellschaft's supervisory board is dominated by representatives of
Deutsche and Dresdner Banks and the Allianz insurance company. Although Mr
Schimmelbusch was clearly at fault in failing to keep lines of communication
open with the supervisory board, the latter also seems to have been only
incompletely fulfilling its responsibility for checking his actions.
Germany's two largest banks should now review whether their representatives
on supervisory boards around the country are really in touch with the
companies they help to lead.
The interlocking system of German capitalism, founded on co-operation
between management, banks, government and labour, has been an essential
factor behind the country's recovery after 1945. For much of the post-war
era, German-style consensus seemed to offer a more reliable, fair and
efficient means of achieving economic growth than the more free-wheeling
economic systems in Britain or the US. Now, however, German industry is
facing peculiarly difficult challenges caused by recession and high
production costs, while society as a whole has become a great deal more
brittle as a result of the strains of reunification. As a result, the
question of whether Germany's consensus-based industrial structure needs a
radical overhaul has become a matter of unusual public debate. If Mr
Schimmelbusch's downfall helps to give this debate extra focus, then the
Metallgesellschaft case will have had a salutary effect for German industry
as a whole.

FT  21 DEC 93 / No script yet for urgent dialogue: Talks between the
government and Islamic fundamentalists might staunch Algeria's violence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The moment of truth is fast approaching for Algeria's military and civilian
leaders. The extension of the mandate of the five-man presidency for a month
has provided a breathing space in which to try to curb civil strife, chart a
path to democracy and implement economic reform. If it fails, the violence
which has engulfed the country for the past two years could escalate and
spread.
Western governments are urging their nationals to leave the country. Sixteen
foreigners have been killed since Islamic extremists set a November 30
deadline for non-nationals to leave the country or face reprisals.
Worsening unrest could eventually spill over into neighbouring Morocco and
Tunisia, while southern European countries, which buy increasing quantities
of natural gas from Algeria, also fear the impact of continued political
disorder on the estimated 2m Algerians who live in their midst.
Violence has claimed more than 3,000 lives in Algeria since January 1992,
when the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was outlawed after elections - which
it seemed certain to win - were suspended. The capital Algiers and
surrounding provinces remain under a curfew imposed by the ruling five-man
High State Council. In an increasingly violent campaign against the
government, radical Islamic groups not directly affiliated to the FIS have
killed leading intellectuals; the state security forces have responded by a
'systematic' recourse to torture, according to Amnesty International.
Western diplomats say it is difficult to distinguish between racketeering
and acts of sabotage committed by both sides - public buildings and
factories have been set on fire in what they describe as 'a dirty war'.
Ultimately, the fate of the country remains in the hands of a small group of
army generals, as it has since independence in 1962. The collapse of support
for the government has forced the army centre stage. General Khaled Nezzar,
a leading member of the HCE has played a role in avoiding an open split
among senior officers, such as the chief of staff, General Mohamed Lamari,
who would like to 'eradicate' the fundamentalists, and the minister of
defence, General Lamine Zeroual, who insists that the army's role is to help
forge a national consensus. Other fault-lines exist between older officers
and a younger generation which has little respect for what it sees as the
corruption endemic among long-serving officers.
While none of the five-man presidency accepts the idea of an Islamic
republic being set up in the country, there is an increasing awareness that
the FIS represents a constituency that can no longer be ignored. Hopes of a
dialogue were raised earlier this month when Gen Zeroual's most senior
adviser called, on state television, for 'a dialogue with figures who once
represented the FIS, on condition they had not broken the law'.
Last Friday, the FIS spokesman in Europe, Mr Rabah Khebir, responded by
setting out conditions for opening talks. They include the freeing of all
political prisoners and the establishment of a 'free and independent
committee' to include the main political, judicial and religious figures in
Algeria to discuss the country's future. Most of the other lay parties and
the moderate Islamic Hamas party agree with Mr Khebir that establishing a
dialogue is the only way to avoid further political and economic
disintegration.
But there is little support for the government. Deep-seated resentment at a
quarter of a century of dictatorship by the Front de Liberation National
Party, and the economic mismanagement and corruption it left in its wake
last year, is rife among the professional classes, skilled workers and
millions of ordinary Algerians who have no wish to live under the rule of
Islamic shari'a law.
The generation to which Prime Minister Redha Malek, another crucial member
of the HCE, belongs has refused to hand over any political power to a
younger generation of Algerians, many of whom were educated abroad. Tens of
thousands have gone into de facto exile, while few of those who remained
have had a chance to argue their views or help plan economic liberalisation.
The bold economic changes launched in 1989-91, which abolished the state's
monopoly on foreign trade and opened Algeria to foreign investment, went
into reverse when the elections were suspended.
The state's trade monopoly was reimposed under a former economic overlord of
the 1970s, Mr Belaid Abdessalam, who became prime minister in June 1992, and
relations with the International Monetary Fund were broken off. The
resurrection of the man who had earlier boasted he would turn Algeria into
the 'Japan of Africa' by 2000 convinced many that the government had no real
wish to push through reforms which would spell an end to the considerable
material advantages enjoyed by a few in a closed economy.
The factors which fuelled the large FIS vote two years ago have not changed.
Eighty-four per cent of those seeking a job are between 15 and 30; one
quarter of the population is out of work; living standards are declining as
inflation rises by 30 per cent yearly and shortages get worse; schools and
houses are overcrowded. Many Algerians refer to their rulers routinely as
'houkkoumat Micky' (Mickey Mouse government).
Unlike Mr Abdessalam, Mr Malek, who took over as prime minister in August,
is committed to a market-oriented economy. Preliminary negotiations have
begun with the IMF to loosen the noose of repayments of Algeria's Dollars
26bn foreign debt, which will absorb 83 per cent of total export earnings
for 1993, 97 per cent of which derive from oil. Yet Algeria's western
creditors remain sceptical of the present leaders' ability to enact reform.
They are seeking trade liberalisation and a big devaluation of the dinar,
which fetches three times its official rate on the black market.
But any hopes of an economic renaissance hinge on civil strife being brought
to an end. The temporary withdrawal of representatives of foreign companies
in Algeria is a serious blow to the government's credibility and to the
economy because so many of them are involved in the oil and gas sector.
However, a dialogue between the FIS and the presidency might not in itself
put an end to violence because several radicals groups on both sides of the
political spectrum, in particular the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) which has
claimed responsibility for the 26 foreigners killed since September, might
seek to sabotage talks. The past three years have also divided the FIS,
whose leaders are in jail or in hiding or in exile.
Some of Algeria's key western economic partners, such as the US, have
accepted that an FIS election victory would not have led to the
establishment of democracy because many of the front's leaders made no
secret of their contempt for the ballot box. They claimed that a victory at
the poll would be a mandate from God.
In the words of one western diplomat, Algeria today is 'a test tube baby'.
However difficult it may be to begin a dialogue, such a course appears to
many Algerians and foreign observers to offer the only glimmer of hope.
Harsher repression of the fundamentalists could bring the risk of civil war
nearer.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Out in the cold: Europe's reaction to deepening unrest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the absence of political dialogue and economic reform in Algeria, the
European Union is increasingly leaving the country out in the cold.
Yesterday the EU Council of Ministers gave the Brussels Commission a mandate
to negotiate an eventual free trade accord with Tunisia, as the Council had
earlier this month decided to do for Morocco. No such new relationship with
Europe is in prospect for Algeria, until the latter's government can find
some way of ending its incipient civil war with Islamic dissidents and
returning to the path of economic reform.
Much turns on Algeria's negotiations with the International Monetary Fund
for a reform and credit package; an IMF team has just visited the country
and will return for further negotiations next month.
'We hope that the Algerians will get into bed with the IMF and produce a
nice baby in the form of an economic reform programme,' said a Brussels
official yesterday. And indeed Mr Rehda Malek, the prime minister, was last
week promising 'an acceleration of economic reform and speedy moves to
re-establish security' to reassure Algeria's foreign partners.
But until this happens, the second, Ecu150m tranche of a 1991 EU credit to
Algeria will remain frozen, though Brussels has this year given the country
Ecu100m for low-cost housing and food imports. These amounts are small,
given Algeria's crushing debt-servicing burden, which at present eats up
almost the entirety of its oil and gas export earnings. But the Algiers
government refuses to seek a full rescheduling of its debt, as Mr Jacques
Delors, the European Commission president, and a number of EU governments
have urged it to do.
Mr Malek only talks of a partial 'reshaping' of the debt. This refusal to
countenance a full rescheduling stems in large part from the Algerians'
feeling that they would lose face and sovereignty in submitting themselves
to the closer creditor scrutiny which accompanies such debt relief, but also
because Japan, one of Algeria's biggest creditors, is set against any
rescheduling.
Unlike distant Japan, France feels exposed to the impact of social and
political upheaval in Algeria. The French government has been quietly urging
its European partners to follow its lead in renewing credit to the country.
Earlier this year France gave Algeria a FFr6bn export credit to enable it
buy French goods, especially food, pharmaceuticals and car parts. 'But we
are a bit alone in this,' said a French official yesterday, though he
claimed Italy and Spain shared French concern about stability in Algeria.
At the same time, in response to the Islamic fundamentalists' killings of
foreigners, the French government is discreetly reducing the size of the
French community in Algeria. There are, or were, 25,000 French nationals
registered with the three French consulates, with more than 50,000
unregistered French citizens in the country, mostly with dual nationality.
In addition to pulling out some of its own diplomats and employees in
Algeria, the French government has been advising its citizens to take
advantage of the autumn school break and now the Christmas holidays to come
to France and not to return. Some 5,000 French, mainly wives and children,
have taken this advice since mid-October. The remaining French community in
Algeria has been told to exercise 'extreme vigilance', and has been given
radio telephones to stay in contact with French consulates.
From Paris has come a steady stream of public calls for the Algerian
authorities to talk to its opponents and to do a deal with the IMF. In doing
so, France has tried to keep a certain distance from the Algerian regime.
But this effort was somewhat undermined by the French interior ministry's
recent action in rounding up some 88 suspected Islamic fundamentalists in
France for questioning about their links with the FIS and other
organisations.
France's overriding interest is in stability in Algeria, whoever rules the
country. In the end, Paris reckons that the Algerian government has a far
better chance of providing the democratic and economic conditions for
stability than its opponents.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Hong Kong, the moral responsibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   Ms EMILY LAU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'Hong Kong: the next stage' (December 17), suggested
that if serious uncertainties about the future of Hong Kong were aroused,
Britain would have to reconsider the issue of passports. The time has come
to ask once again whether it is morally and politically justifiable for
Britain to hand over 6m people to Chinese communist rule in 1997, given
Peking's blatant disregard for the promise of 'a high degree of autonomy'
enshrined in the 1984 Sino-British joint declaration.
Peking's refusal to permit democratic elections has been clearly
demonstrated in the 17 rounds of fruitless Sino-British negotiations.
Besides democracy, the colony's legal and judicial framework and the
preservation of civil liberties are all in doubt.
As Chris Patten, the governor, admitted to your newspaper: 'It would be
failure if I wasn't able to persuade China that Hong Kong is mature,
sophisticated, modest in its political ambitions and capable of doing a lot
more to look after its own affairs. I would have failed if I hadn't been
able to persuade China that politics in a free society is no threat.'
It looks like Mr Patten has failed. If so, where does this leave Britain's
moral and political responsibility for the way of life of the people of Hong
Kong?

FT  21 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Where responsibility lies over the
future of London orchestras
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANTHONY EVERITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Given the general misconceptions that have arisen over the role of Sir
Leonard Hoffman in relation to the funding of the London orchestras, it is
important to set the record straight and point out that Antony Thorncroft is
quite incorrect when he asserts ('Out of Tune with its clients', December
11) that 'it was a ludicrous dereliction of duty to ask an outsider, Sir
Leonard Hoffmann, to decide which of the three orchestras should receive
Arts Council money'.
The committee of orchestral experts, chaired by Sir Leonard (in a lay
capacity) was appointed to offer independent analysis to advise the
council's music panel. The panel in turn recommends to the full council what
it considers to be the best course of action to take. It is the council
itself that is responsible for making the decision. Moreover, Sir Leonard
was not chosen because of his (unquestioned) legal eminence, but for his
outstanding abilities in chairing an independent committee.
Your correspondent goes on to suggest that 'according to the council's plan,
the LPO was to get the vote, confirming its position as house orchestra at
the South Bank'. Not so. There was no such plan, no such vote-rigging, as
implied - and no pre-set hidden agenda. The Arts Council has throughout
remained open-minded on the issue. It has taken its decision on the basis of
the advice by the Hoffmann committee - and in the light of a full analysis
of the implications of the reduced grant it has received for next year.
This is not, let it be said, 'another example of the Arts Council's
unresolved battle as to whether its role is to fight for the arts, or to
give government better value for its subsidy'.
We at the Arts Council believe that, contrary to the distorting views of
some of our critics, we can - and do - perform both functions; the first
priority is an integral part of the accomplishment of the second. They are
not mutually exclusive aims.
Complex issues are involved here, matters that have to be handled in a
proper procedural and responsible manner. The council is thus now in the
process of making some difficult decisions and drawing up a range of - in
some instances - unpalatable priorities.
Such deliberations simply cannot be conveyed, or indeed dismissed, in the
simplistic language of the headline makers.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Time to come clean on pension
commitments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TERRY ARTHUR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am sorry to see Samuel Brittan slip from his normal level of
objectivity in arguing ('The harmful myth of hidden state debt', December
13) that unfunded public sector pension liabilities are not comparable to
other national debt.
He states that future pensions are 'like any other form of rising public
expenditure' to be met from future tax revenue or its equivalent. While this
is correct - as it is for servicing conventional debts (gilts), which have
no liability other than future servicing and amortisation - the whole point
in capitalisation is to express accrued 'commitments'. Indeed, unfunded
pension liabilities could easily be switched into the conventional gilt
sector by a scrip issue of gilts, the servicing of which (including
maturities) matches pension outgo. Of course the procedure should be applied
only in respect of accrued liabilities, that is those deemed to remain if
workers downed tools (and thus destroyed the future tax base).
In denying such an identity Mr Brittan must surely be arguing that future
pension payments, unlike gilt-edged debt, are not genuine commitments. On
past form, he is probably right, but if so let's come clean]
Mr Brittan gives himself away in concluding that disclosures of higher debt
will promote tax increases which will 'delay recovery still further'. Not
every economist believes this argument, but for those who do believe it, is
it a justification for deceit?

FT  21 DEC 93 / All I want for Christmas . . .: The modest desires of UK
business leaders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Washington radio station once asked local diplomats what they would like
for Christmas. The French ambassador said that he would like world peace.
The Canadian ambassador said he wanted enough food to feed starving people
everywhere. The British ambassador said that a box of crystallised fruit
would be nice, thank you very much.
This year the Financial Times put a similar question to business and City
leaders. Unlike the ambassadors, they did not want to throw away their one
wish on peace and goodwill all round. Instead, they picked something nice
for themselves, their companies and the economy, in that order. Prudently,
most had a fall-back, just in case their first choice was unobtainable.
Among those desiring material items, Sir Simon Hornby, chairman of W H
Smith, asks for a kilogramme of caviar. Failing that, he wants the most
expensive Bang and Olufsen CD player that money can buy.
He is not alone in wanting something electronic. Dominic Cadbury, chief
executive of Cadbury Schweppes, would like a video so idiot-proof that he
can programme it without his children.
At the other end of the scale of technological competence is Alastair Ross
Goobey, chief executive of Postel, the UK's largest pension fund, who would
like a 486 PC with a gravis ultra-sound card. 'The 486 is the latest PC and
the card will allow me to compose music on it,' he says, in case Santa is
computer illiterate.
But the most popular personal gifts for business leaders this year are
things that money cannot buy: what they would really like is to change
themselves, their circumstances or their opportunities.
Lord Hanson, who at the age of 71 must know his career cannot last forever,
is in no doubt about what he wants. 'My fantasy gift is to have more time,'
he says. 'When you are spending six months of the year in the US and six
months here it is as though you never have more than half a day to get
things done.' Peter Morgan, who will be out of work next year when he steps
down as director-general of the Institute of Directors, would like a new
job.
Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, the media group, craftily slips a
bit of personal PR into his Christmas wish. He would like to relive that
perfect day in June 1992 when he triumphed over West Indian cricketer Clive
Lloyd at a pro-celebrity cricket match. David Simon, chief executive of BP,
has a more modest sporting request: a new golf swing.
On a more humble level, Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT Industries,
would like a Christmas card from the Police Federation. His recent report
recommending that bobbies be paid in performance-related pennies went down
so badly with police that he is more likely to get handcuffs.
Less politically correct is a suggestion from Dominic Cadbury. Besides a
video, he wants a radar to inform him when his wife is wearing something new
or has had her hair done.
Some captains of industry have spared a thought for their company's
Christmas needs. Failing his cricket request, Martin Sorrell would like an
extra one per cent on margins at his WPP. Sir Christopher Bland, chairman of
London Weekend Television simply wants to keep what he has: LWT. His present
would be to foil Granada Group's unwelcome takeover bid.
This year's most popular high-minded gift for executives was a General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade deal. But Sir Christopher Hogg, chairman of
Reuters, and Sir Derek Birkin, chairman of RTZ, the mining group - both of
whom said they wanted this above all else - have not had to wait until
Christmas morning.
Others with worthy requests will have to wait rather longer. Sir Nicholas
Goodison, chairman of the TSB, asks for an independent Bank of England: he
might have been better off requesting another valuable clock to add to his
collection.
John Monks has shown that stuffiness is not restricted to the board room. No
frivolity for him. He is treating his first Christmas as TUC general
secretary as an opportunity to reiterate the wishes of his organisation. He
has sent Santa a detailed request for legislation on basic rights for people
at work, with clauses on health, safety and training.
The wish of Peter Morgan, his counterpart at IoD, is just as unlikely to be
granted. His ideal present is 1m people off the unemployment register.
Paddy Linaker, managing director of M &amp; G, the fund management group, also
chooses the economy as his theme, but his wish is unseasonal. He would like
to see all those who formulated Treasury economic policy out of a job. 'Some
have been there too long. In this harsh economic climate, if you don't bring
home the bacon you usually find yourself on the way somewhere else.'
He is not the only one short of seasonal cheer. Stanley Kalms, chairman of
Dixons, the high street electrical retailer, is too busy selling computer
games to think about what he wants himself. Andrew Coppel, the new chief
executive of Queens Moat Holdings, the hotels group, is having such a
wretched time trying to keep the company afloat that he postponed any
thought of Christmas gifts until next year.
Martin Taylor, having given a profits warning as his parting gift to
Courtaulds Textiles before he leaves to become chief executive of Barclays
bank, is also in no mood to discuss presents. 'I'm afraid Mr Taylor is too
busy to help you with your article,' his secretary said.
At least the ambassadors kept their wishes seasonal, with a thought for the
poor and needy, or of traditional luxuries. If Sir Simon Hornby gets his
caviar, perhaps he will show some Christmas spirit and share it around.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Blob on the landscape: The UK's falling share of world pop
sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you want to know what ails British pop music today, look at Mr Blobby,
says Mr Chris Wright, chairman of the Chrysalis music and entertainment
group.
Mr Blobby, for the uninitiated, is a corpulent, spotty, rubber television
character with a song which currently occupies top position in Britain's
singles charts.
Mr Wright believes the UK music industry has become obsessed with one-off
hits such as Mr Blobby, rather than promoting bands long term so that they
can succeed on a world stage.
The statistics appear to bear out his concerns. British artists' share of
world music sales has fallen steadily over the past four years, according to
figures produced by the British Phonographic Industry, which represents UK
music companies.
In 1982, Mr Peter Scaping, BPI's research director, estimates UK artists
accounted for about 25 per cent of worldwide music sales. In 1989, the
figure was 23 per cent. Last year it was 18 per cent.
The decline in UK market share has occurred worldwide. In the US, album
sales by UK artists fell from 19.6 per cent of the market in 1989 to 14.5
per cent last year. In Europe, including the UK, British artists' albums
accounted for 29.8 per cent of sales last year, compared with 35 per cent in
1989.
The UK has produced a string of international artists over the three decades
since the 1960s, from Cliff Richard, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones to
Elton John and Boy George. But there have been few new British successes
since the early 1980s.
George Michael, one of the more recent UK artists to attract an
international following, is currently mired in a protracted legal dispute
with Sony, his record company - although in his case he alleges that it is
Sony's US executives who have failed to back his musical development while
its UK managers have supported him.
Mr Wright argues that the UK music industry's concentration on the success
of single songs has made the local charts more volatile. Because many groups
have not built up a substantial body of music or customer loyalty, they tend
to disappear when their hits drop out of the charts.
This has reduced the credibility of the UK charts overseas, Mr Wright says.
'There was a stage when you could go to America or Germany and say that
someone was number one in England and people would say 'they must be good'.
Now nobody in America or Germany cares what's number one in England. They
say: 'So what? The last 20 people who were number one in England we never
heard of again.''
The industry's defenders argue against reading too much into the worldwide
market share statistics. These figures are volatile, they say, and could
change suddenly if a few new UK artists emerged.
Mr Rupert Perry, BPI chairman and UK chief executive of EMI Music, prefers
to concentrate on the overall benefit British music continues to bring to
the domestic economy.
Visible exports of UK music, in the form of compact discs, cassettes and
vinyl records, have grown from Pounds 86.2m in 1987 to Pounds 141.9m in 1989
to Pounds 211.9m last year. Imports have, however, also grown steadily
throughout that period. While the UK had a positive balance of trade of
Pounds 72m last year, this was slightly down on the 1990 figure of Pounds
74.5m and the Pounds 72.3m recorded in 1991.
Exports of CDs and cassettes represent, however, only a small proportion of
the UK's earnings from music. More important are the industry's invisible
exports, which include royalties and income from performances. The BPI
estimates that UK artists' invisible earnings rose from Pounds 450m in 1989
to Pounds 550m in 1992.
Mr Perry accepts that the worldwide market share figures might be a sign
that invisible earnings from music could turn down in future years; royalty
earnings, for example, include the exploitation of the rich back catalogue
that British musicians have produced over the years. Fewer UK artists in
charts around the world today could translate into lower royalty earnings in
the future.
Mr Perry accepts that the UK charts have become more volatile, but adds that
the same trend is now apparent elsewhere. He says the fragmentation of the
UK market, with the proliferation of different musical genres, has also made
it more difficult for groups to make an international impact. Different
musical forms attract relatively small groups of consumers with insufficient
mass to provide bands with large-scale sales.
An additional reason for the decline in the UK's worldwide market share, Mr
Perry says, is the increased popularity of local artists in markets around
the world.
Some in the industry attribute the rise of local artists to the revival of
nationalism in Europe and elsewhere. Mr Martin Mills, managing director of
the music company Beggar's Banquet, also points to the increasing success of
American rock groups such as Nirvana.
He says: 'For a long time, American bands didn't export very well. Rap still
doesn't export very well. But the Americans have become much better at it
than they used to be. I think there's as much musical vitality in this
country as there used to be. But the other side are doing it much better
than they used to.'
Mr Perry adds that satellite television has helped increase the popularity
of US rock acts in regions such as south-east Asia.
Some critics in the industry argue that the technical expertise of UK
musicians has declined, aided by the punk wave and its celebration of
playing instruments badly.
But even Mr Wright, who this year started a new label called Echo after
selling Chrysalis' recording interests to Thorn EMI, believes there is as
much musical expertise and proficiency in the UK today as in previous
decades.
What some British groups lack, he says, is an understanding of how the music
industry operates and how to market themselves.
He adds: 'American musicians, however good they are, think that they have to
behave like businessmen. English musicians think talent's enough. They think
they're degrading themselves by talking to people in the music trade.'

Sir, In view of the Department of the Environment's enthusiasm for listing
working buildings which symbolise their time, surely it should consider
making an order on its Marsham Street complex.
It does fulfil many of the criteria for inclusion. It is typical of the
style of its period, built with the most advanced contemporary techniques
and providing an excellent example of the working environment deemed
suitable at the time.
Is it not very unfair that the department should not order it to be
preserved exactly as it is, rather than paying attention to the wishes of
the owners and occupiers of the premises? After all, privately owned
industrial and commercial buildings are listed without any consideration of
the cost of their upkeep, or any consultation with the owners and occupiers
whatsoever.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Arts: 'La Vestale' opens La Scala season
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM WEAVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After the ill-received Don Carlo that opened the 1992-93 season at La Scala,
Riccardo Muti, musical director of the great Milanese house, decided to
inaugurate the current operatic year with a safer, because much less
familiar work: Gaspare Spontini's La Vestale, last given at La Scala 39
years ago.
This revival was to be an ultra-serious occasion: the opera would be given
in the original French (though the cast was almost entirely Anglophone), the
cuts would all be opened, and the substantial ballets would be performed
complete. Liliana Cavani, who staged the successful Muti Traviata two years
ago, was called on to produce the opera, which would be designed by
Margherita Palli (scenes) and Gabriella Pescucci (costumes).
Because of the political scandals that have rocked Milan and thanks, no
doubt also to the recession, the opening night was less be-furred and
be-jewelled than usual, but the television cameras were there to record the
occasion and to transmit the enthusiasm of the few celebrities in the
audience. The critics were also generally favourable, but anyone accustomed
to reading between their lines caught a distinct whiff of boredom. On the
second night, the audience was still polite, but icy. Not a single number
was applauded. There was extended applause at the end, true, but there was
also a fair number of emptied seats.
Some members of the audience could recall the Vestale of 1954, in Italian,
with dances and other music cut; but staged by Luchino Visconti (his debut
in opera) and sung by the refulgent Maria Callas, at the zenith of her
career. That evening was as unforgettable, as the Muti Vestale is
forgettable. Callas's every inflection, every gesture had meaning and power.
For his Julia Muti chose a young American soprano, Karen Huffstodt, of
considerable vocal force, but without any dramatic profundity. Above all,
she showed no feeling for declamation; her French words, often smudged,
seemed to have little meaning for her. She dutifully went through the
motions - love, despair, anguish, joy - but she conveyed no depth or truth
of feeling. There was never any sense of vulnerability or of menace.
Muti often drew beautiful sounds from his orchestra, and he deftly pointed
out many enchanting instrumental subtleties. This is a period he loves and
he has obviously absorbed and feels every note of the score (except perhaps
for the almost silly ballet music); but at La Scala he did not communicate
his conviction to the cast, not even to the usually responsive chorus. At
times, stage and pit were simply not together; and even when they were, the
emotion was all in the orchestra.
Only Anthony Michaels-Moore made sense of his words and produced eloquent,
varied, engaging song. Denyce Graves, that superlative Carmen, was a vocally
correct but perfunctory Grand Vestale; Patrick Raftery, a cipher in the role
of Cinna; and Dimitri Kavrakos, an inadequate High Priest.
Part of the fault undoubtedly lay with the visual presentation. Cavani, this
time, was uninspired and repetitious. Again and again, Licinius would make a
move towards Julia, and every time Cinna would mechanically grab his arms or
shoulders to restrain him. In the second act, for her long, crucial
monologue, a superb and presumably private self-examination, Julia was never
alone: a few intrusive sister-Vestals were always fussing around her. The
action was set not in 3rd century Rome but more or less in 1807, the year of
the opera's presentation. It is Napoleonic Rome, then, and this might be all
right for the sets, but the costumes - especially for the High Priest, who
looks like a 33rd-degree Mason - are distracting, and the Vestals, instead
of wearing the traditional white, are in drab buff and maroon, some of them
with hideous bonnets.
The ridiculous ballet devised by Amedeo Amodio was obviously meant as a
vehicle for Carla Fracci (she appeared in the Visconti Vestale two
generations ago). It was cruel of La Scala to offer her this role, and it
was unwise of her to accept it.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Arts: 'The Red Shoes' fails on Broadway - Karen Fricker
suggests the cast should have shut up and danced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Dollars 8m musical adaptation of the film The Red Shoes earned a lot of
nicknames on its way to Broadway - 'The Pink Slips,' for its numerous staff
firings, including star Roger Rees; 'Jule's Last Jam,' referring to the
show's venerable composer, Jule Styne; 'The Dread Shoes' . . . but none, it
turns out, more prescient than 'The Cement Shoes.' Following universally
negative local reviews, The Red Shoes closed on Sunday after five
performances and 51 previews.
The musical will not sink without a trace, however; it leaves regretful
memories of unrealised potential and more than a few flashes of brilliance.
Structurally and thematically, the musical strongly resembles its source -
the 1948 Powell and Pressburger film which made a star of Moira Shearer as
the gifted ballerina, Victoria Page, torn between her love for a young
composer and her desire to dance for her charismatic mentor. The main
difference in plot between film and musical is the shift of the Red Shoes
ballet to the musical's end - an excellent choice, since it is the evening's
high point.
For when The Red Shoes dances, it is sublime. Lar Lubovich's joyous
choreography, set to Styne's remarkably able ballet music, and skillfully
danced by a company led by the astonishing Margaret Illmann, a principal
dancer with the National Ballet of Canada making her stage debut - all are
first rate. But when The Red Shoes talks, it is mediocre, and when it sings,
it is execrable.
Styne has penned some terrific scores in his day, among them Gypsy, Bells
are Ringing and Funny Girl, but The Red Shoes' tunes are musically
underdeveloped and simplistic, and are matched in banality by the lyrics, by
librettist Marsha Norman and 'Paul Stryker' (a pseudonym for Styne's
longtime writing partner, Bob Merrill). Stanley Donen, the director of such
classic musical films as Singin' in the Rain and On the Town, was brought in
to direct The Red Shoes after Susan H. Schulman was taken off the job in
August; his work is sturdy but unimaginative.
The musical starts out strongly, wasting little time getting to the party
scene at which ballet impresario Boris Lermentov (Steve Barton) and Vicky
(Illmann) meet; in the first of several exchanges taken verbatim from the
film, he asks her 'Why do you want to dance?' prompting her reply, 'Why do
you want to live?' - words etched on the consciousness of balletomanes
everywhere.
Draped in a low-backed, sequined party gown, Illmann is an Erte painting
come to life, long and lithe, and her surprisingly deep voice adds an exotic
touch to her appeal. If her acting is sometimes nervously forced and her
singing weak (blessedly, she is only given half a song), all is forgiven
when she dances - her face shining and her limbs unfurled, she seems to
embody the spirit of dance itself.
So far, everything is twirling along nicely for The Red Shoes: the plot is
developing efficiently, the sets, by Heidi Landesman, and costumes, by
Catherine Zuber, are sumptuous and splendid, and the performers' talents
impressive. Then a musical number comes along, and The Red Shoes' common
denominator plummets. George de la Pena, otherwise outstanding as the dance
captain, Grisha, is saddled with leading the dancer's thumping sing-along:
'Not sister or brother/we did it for mother/ . . . so that she can say/I
have a daughter or son/who's in the corps de ballet.'
The songs help no one in the show, but the character they damage most is
Lermentov. Part Diaghilev, part Henry Higgins, part Svengali, the film's
Lermentov embodies genius run amok, the need to create cruelly interwoven
with the need to control. But the musical's Lermentov is nothing more than a
lonely, washed-up lecher, in love with Vicky but unable to tell her; the
songs he is given to sing reveal his inner life to be as complex as a
nursery rhyme. Barton is cookie-cutter handsome, with a fine enough singing
voice (the attribute Rees lacked, which reportedly cost him the job), but
has not the charisma that Lermentov needs.
Any complexity in the character of Julian Craster, Vicky's composer suitor,
is also lost. His creative life played down, he becomes just a dopey dupe in
love ('I must be where you are/across the room's too far'); as Julian, Hugh
Panaro is handsome and rich-voiced, but bland. Poor writing also turns Vicky
into the embodiment of an ideal rather than a person in passionate turmoil.
In the musical's climactic dressing-room confrontation, after Julian and
Lermentov bark out her options - guaranteed stardom or matrimonial bliss -
Vicky's choice, to dance, seems at once obvious and arbitrary.
Choreographer Lubovich excels throughout, but his piece de resistance is the
ballet itself, which retells the Hans Christian Anderson tale of a girl
whose new pair of red shoes dance her to a gory death - a tragic end that
foreshadows Vicky's own fate. If the ballet's characterisations of villagers
and gypsies seem slightly overstated, the story told is moving and
involving, particularly the final graveyard scene, featuring a procession of
white-haired, white-gowned, red-shod maidens, and a concrete angel who comes
to life and floats heavenward, Vicky in his arms. After the ballet, the
musical seems to give up; its calamitous ending is sloppily executed.
The question that remains after The Red Shoes' quick demise is whether a
good musical version of the film is possible - or desirable - at all. After
this debacle it will surely be years before anyone has the nerve to attempt
it. But were a writer/director team to emerge who could match them, there
are a ballerina and a choreographer out there who are up to the challenge.

Channel 4 is a British network with London headquarters. London is one of
the world's great capital cities: its earliest buildings stood on the banks
of the Thames before the Romans arrived. Thousands of plays, films and
programmes have been made about London. So what do you suppose is the
linking theme for Channel 4's special Christmas season? That's right - New
York.
They begin with Tall Stories (7.50), a short documentary about New York
skyscrapers. At 10.00 comes RuPaul's Christmas Ball, RuPaul Charles being a
black American drag queen and 'chanteuse'. Channel 4 asserts that 'his
appearances on American chat shows have made him a household name'. Not in
your house, perhaps, or mine, but in those of Channel 4 executives no doubt.
11.05 brings the first of four programmes looking at New York's 24-hour
cable news service and that is followed by Straight Out Of Brooklyn (11.35)
a movie about lives of violence and poverty in New York. Do you often find
yourself with friends lamenting the paucity of American material on
television?

FT  21 DEC 93 / Arts: Driven to abstraction - The work of Fiona Rae
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fiona Rae is that now rare creature, a young painter of some interest sent
out into the unforgiving world by the much-vaunted fine-art school of the
Goldsmiths' College. She graduated in 1987, since when her work has been
included in major exhibitions at home and abroad, notably the third British
Art Show, and the Aperto for young artists at the Venice Biennale of 1990.
She has had solo exhibitions in Glasgow, London and Basle, and her work is
represented in public collections such as that of the Tate and the Arts
Council. In 1991 she was nominated for the Turner Prize. She is still barely
30 years old.
Her paintings are large, bright and abstract, with any particular reference
either veiled or incidental, cut off from any source in experience of the
real world. The pictorial space is ambiguous and disrupted, the
colour-ground laid on as an impersonal, uninflected, often hard-edged area
of paint. Should it be blue, as it so often is, it carries with it the
immediate connotation of an infinite, cosmic space: any other colour, and it
becomes a solid screen that closes down the space, close and parallel to the
picture-plane. Within this pictorial arena, moving across and against this
theatrical backdrop, the more loosely graphic and expressive gestures and
motifs make their way, from incident to incident.
Rae carries all this off with considerable technical sophistication and
aplomb. Here is painting at its most knowing and self-regarding, in terms
both of imagery and practice, in the constant reference to the history of
modern painting, and in the sheer variety of mark and texture in the
application of the paint. Dribbles, scrawls, drags and splodges, all are
here, most lovingly noted and prettily expressed, even though the mark or
effect may be anything but pretty. Indeed it takes a clever hand and knowing
eye together to achieve passages of paint as awkward and ugly as so often
these are.
But to what end? The brief, anonymous apologetic in the introductory
leaflet, entitled 'Rehearsing the Spontaneous', rather gives the game away.
'The history of painting in the past 150 years', it tells us, 'has been one
of attack from outside, and strenuous development from within . . . Easel
painting fitted too easily into museums and the homes of the rich to be a
tool for challenging established social and aesthetic order . . . . . .
Fiona Rae is conscious of the accumulated weight of painting's history, the
old argument that nothing new can be done. Yet she has found a way of
synthesising a myriad of painting's 20th century languages, creating her own
edgy amalgam. The effect is one of eclecticism run riot . . . . Rae's
paintings are about the profusion, excess and profligacy of late 20th
century visual and material culture . . . Rae's work raises complex issues
of authenticity, as certain passages become themselves representations of
paint, or the history of painting. This is a post-modern, knowing element in
the work, constructed as a response to a crisis of originality . . .'
Leaving aside the point that Miss Rae's own paintings hang in museums and
hardly come cheap, it is seems that her work qualifies her for the success
she has so rapidly achieved not by being what it is - which is competent and
fairly lively abstraction - but by what it is about. There we have it, the
litany of excuses that masquerades as explanation, the suggestion that
painting in our time must be some sort of socio-political engagement or it
is nothing, the unquestioning acceptance that the only true subject of art
is art itself.
We are further told that 'while Rae uses objects from the real world as a
source, she is at pains to remove any figurative elements from the work,
believing that there are other ways of understanding or constructing the
world than those of conventional representation.' But what are these other
ways? And why are both writer and painter at such pains to disavow
'conventional representation', as though it were the deadliest of
corruptions? Why the evident fear that we might think Miss Rae the least bit
interested in responding simply and directly to the world about her? Might
it not be that to look out at the natural world, at the figure or the
landscape, is to set oneself a task somewhat harder to resolve than eclectic
pastiche of the work of other artists?
Who can say whether it was by luck or misfortune that the young Rae, keen to
be an artist, fetched up at Goldsmiths' from her foundation course.
Whichever the case, we may reasonably doubt that she ever worked directly
from nature again. Did she ever? She at least accepts the great precept by
which her distinguished alma mater has made its modern reputation - the
world does not matter: it is the idea that counts.
*
The landscapes and still-lifes of Diana Armfield, now in their last few days
at Browse &amp; Darby, might give her pause. Here is work that will never sniff
a Turner nomination or British Council tour abroad, yet it represents the
steady, modest, cumulated experience of a long career spent coming to terms
with what the eye can see and the hand resolve into paint on a flat surface.
It is what Chardin too, if we are to be art-historical about it, spent a
lifetime doing, and what was true for him still holds true for us, if only
we think of it.
There is nothing necessarily more profound in its potential, nor more worthy
of the artist's attention, than a flower in a pot. Two of Miss Armfield's
small studies, of flowers on a Welsh window-sill and, in particular, of a
bunch of wild roses in a jam-jar, are as fine and delicate in their working,
and as true and beautiful in themselves, as anything of their kind I have
seen by a living artist in too long a time.
Fiona Rae: New paintings; Institute of Contemporary Art, The Mall, SW1 until
Feb 6. Diana Armfield, Browse &amp; Darby, 19 Cork St, W1 until Dec 23.

FT  21 DEC 93 / People: McKillop takes over from Friend at Zeneca
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Changes are afoot in one of Zeneca's three divisions. While Alan Pink, chief
executive agrochemicals and seeds, and Rodney Brown, chief executive
specialities, are still with ICI's former bioscience operations, David
Friend, chief executive Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, is taking early retirement.
Friend, 59, is being replaced by David McKillop, Zeneca's Scottish deputy
chief executive and international research and development director.
McKillop (left), only 50, has a formidable academic record, gaining the top
first in his year at Glasgow, a PhD, and a period at Centre de Mechanique
Ondulatoire which is associated with the Sorbonne. He is well respected
within the industry.
The Scot emerged from the depths of ICI into the media spotlight after
Hanson, the Anglo-American group, took a stake in the company. Media
attention was heightened by ICI's split, which left the pharmaceuticals
division as the group's most important earner.
Initially media-shy, he has been a quick learner and has proved increasingly
adept at communicating his enthusiasm for the group's development pipeline.
McKillop will be running one of the UK's fourth largest pharmaceuticals
groups and the world's 22nd largest, with annual sales last year of nearly
Pounds 3bn.
That will leave little time for him to improve his golf handicap - he plays
off 14; reads books on maths, logic and philosophy, his preferred material,
though at present he is reading a brief history of England because he says
he knows too little about the country; or watch rugger - he used to be a
handy player until a back injury stopped his career.

FT  21 DEC 93 / People: Green takes new top post at CWS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Co-operative Wholesale Society, whose retail turnover has grown from Pounds
800m to Pounds 2bn in three years, has created a new post of chief general
manager, to be filled by Allan Green, currently general manager, national
buying and marketing.
CWS has expanded its retailing activities beyond its traditional areas of
Scotland, Northern Ireland and the south-east through a series of mergers
with regional societies - including the large Nottingham and North-Eastern
societies - and has overtaken the Co-operative Retail Society as the UK's
largest co-operative retailer.
Green, 48, joined the CWS in 1990 as food trade manager of the south-eastern
retail business. He had previously held positions with Hillards, the
supermarket chain later taken over by Tesco, and with Booker, the wholesale
and cash-and-carry group.
He moved to CWS head office in Manchester last year to take on the job of
centralising the buying and marketing activities across the society in the
wake of its regional mergers. Green also played a significant role in
creating the Co-operative Retail Trading Group, a buying partnership which
harnesses nearly 60 per cent of national Co-op buying power through CWS
Retail.
Green joins Bruce McDougall, existing chief general manager of CWS's
specialist retail functions - which include its travel business, opticians
and funeral business. He will be succeeded as general manager of national
buying and retail marketing by his deputy David Chambers.

FT  21 DEC 93 / People: Sir Sydney's true and fair views
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The accounting world should be braced for a shake-up in the new year as Sir
Sydney Lipworth, QC, takes on the chairmanship of the Financial Reporting
Council.
Sir Sydney (right) turns his hand to company accounts after his role as
chairman of the tough-minded Monopolies and Mergers Commission from 1988 to
April 1993.
He replaces Sir Ron Dearing, former head of the Post Office Corporation, who
is retiring from the world of accounting while staying on as head of the
Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority.
Sir Ron had been in the unusual position of attempting to implement his own
recommendations - he chaired the 1988 report which argued for the council
and its two main subsidiaries, the Accounting Standards Board and the
Financial Reporting Review Panel.
Sir Sydney, 62, who was selected by representatives from the Department of
Trade and Industry and the Bank of England, takes on the job for three
years; his tenure may then be renewed.
He is holding fire on his ideas for the new job, but says: 'It's a
fascinating area and one which one wants to see absolutely right.' He wants
to see 'consistency' in accounts, and a format that 'best represents the
achievements of the year'.
Sir Sydney studied accountancy as part of his first degree in commerce and
law at Witwatersrand University in Johannesburg, before coming to the UK in
1965.
He worked for Abbey Life Assurance, and joined Allied Dunbar Assurance,
rising to become deputy chairman in 1984. He was also a director of BAT. He
is currently deputy chairman of National Westminster Bank and on the board
of Carlton Communications.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Business and the Law: Sex, equality and pensions - European
Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court last week confirmed that the equal treatment principles
established in its 1990 Barber judgment for contracted-out private pensions,
also apply to private company pension schemes.
The Court said the Rome treaty principle of equal pay for equal work in the
context of retirement age discrimination was not restricted to
contracted-out private pension schemes.
Company pension schemes, where the pension payments qualify as remuneration
for employment under the treaty rules on equal treatment of men and women,
are also covered.
Moreover, enforceability in the national courts of the treaty rule on equal
treatment was not affected by a 1986 directive on implementation of the
equal treatment principle which member countries were obliged to implement
only from January 1 1993.
But the equal pay principle was enforceable only in the context of company
pension schemes from May 17 1990, the date of the Barber decision. The
exception was for employees, or those claiming through them, who had
commenced legal proceedings or an equivalent claim before then.
The Court's ruling came in response to questions referred by the Bonn
Arbeitsgericht about a dispute between Mr Moroni and the Collo company for
which he worked between 1968 and 1983.
During this period he belonged to the company pension scheme, the rules of
which said men could not take their pension before 65 while women could do
so at 60.
German law on private pension schemes provides that when employees leave a
company before retirement age they are entitled to maintain the pension
rights accumulated at that time until 65, if male, and 60, if female.
The amount of pension is calculated by applying to the full pension
entitlement at retirement age a coefficient equal to the ratio between the
employee's age and pensionable age. Since the years to retirement for women
would be less than for men, the pension reduction for men would be greater
than for women.
Mr Moroni claimed before the national court his pension rights should begin
at 60 and be set on the same basis as a woman in the same circumstances.
The ECJ explained its Barber ruling made it clear discrimination in the form
of different pensionable ages for men and women in the context of
contracted-out private pensions infringed the treaty prohibition on pay
discrimination between men and women.
The alignment of the retirement ages on those of the state pension law made
no difference. The principle behind the Barber decision was that the concept
of pay in the treaty rule covered all payments present or future by an
employer to an employee directly or indirectly by reason of the employment.
Payment after termination of employment was not excluded.
Against this background, the ECJ said that the principles applied in Barber
were not limited to UK contracted-out pensions. Provided a pension scheme
was outside the social security system and did not benefit from public
finance, it would be subject to the principle of equal pay when it involved
an agreement between employer and employee and was supplementary to a state
pension.
The ECJ rejected any suggestion that a directive could restrict the
enforceability of the treaty rule on equal treatment. In line with previous
case law, the treaty rule applies directly to all discrimination which can
be established by reference only to the criteria of equivalent work and
equal pay laid down by the treaty.
Finally, the Court confirmed its decision of 6 October 1993 in the Ten Oever
case as to the temporal effect of Barber. It said equal treatment in respect
of company pension rights could only be invoked for pension payments
relating to employment periods after May 17 1990, the date of the Barber
judgment, subject to the exception for prior claims.
This is the second judgment since Barber. A third is due on December 22 in
Neath v Steeper. But no date is fixed for judgment in the Coloroll case.
C-110/91, Moroni v Collo, ECJ FC, 14 December 1993.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Business and the Law: Liable to a flood of litigation -
Changes to Japan's commercial code that facilitate shareholders' actions
against directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HIROSHI ODA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recent changes to the Japanese commercial code making it easier for
shareholders to take legal action on behalf of a company against its
directors and officers and a spate of such 'derivative actions' arising out
of the 1991 Japanese securities houses scandal have raised fears among
Japanese companies of a flood of litigation.
Although derivative actions were introduced in Japan in 1950 they have
seldom been used. The stamp duty payable to initiate litigation was very
high and, if the shareholder won, only the company benefited. Also, the cost
of being involved in litigation, which could last for more than 10 years,
was prohibitive.
Notwithstanding these difficulties, there have been some notable cases. In
September directors of Mitsui Mining were ordered to pay Y3.5bn (Pounds
21.4m) to the company by the Japanese supreme court for their part in an
illegal purchase of its own shares in 1978. The company had been sued by a
shareholder over a loss it made by purchasing shares from a big shareholder
who had objected to its plans to merge with another mining company. Mitsui
had paid a price 25-30 per cent higher than the market price and assigned
them to its own subsidiary companies for a price below the market price.
Another case, still pending before the supreme court, involves the
restructuring of Janome, a sewing machine manufacturer. Two shareholders
accuse the main bank involved in the restructuring of ensuring its own
interests as a creditor at the company's expense through directors seconded
from the bank.
And there have been a number of derivative actions arising out of the 1991
securities scandal in which Japan's big four securities houses secretly paid
compensation to favoured clients for trading losses.
In a case involving compensation of loss paid by Nomura Securities to
favoured customers, the district court of Kyoto rejected shareholders'
claims that directors had not acted in good faith and had not exercised care
as good managers. The court said directors would not be liable unless there
had been a careless error in their perception of facts or the
decision-making process was excessively irrational. It could be 10 years
before this case is finally decided.
Amendments to the commercial code, which came into force in October, should
make it easier to bring derivative actions. The main change concerns the
amount of stamp duty payable to initiate an action.
Stamp duty is calculated on the the size of the claim. Last year a
shareholder of Nikko Securities initiated a derivative action over
compensation paid to favoured customers. The contested amount was Y47bn and
the stamp duty Y235m, or 0.5 per cent.
The shareholder argued, however that the stamp duty should be calculated on
a different basis. The claim was not a proprietary one because, if he won,
the contested amount would be paid to the company and not to him.
The Japanese law on the costs of civil litigation provides that for
non-proprietary claims the contested amount is deemed to be Y950,000. The
district court rejected his argument but the Tokyo appellate court accepted
it.
The latest amendment to the commercial code expressly provides that
derivative actions will be treated as non-proprietary and the stamp duty
will be set at Y8,500, so making it much easier for shareholders to bring
claims.
This change has long been opposed by companies which feared increased
liability and a flood of actions against directors.
The change eventually came out of the Structural Impediments Initiative
trade talks between Japan and the US. The Americans argued shareholders'
rights were not properly protected in Japan and that Japanese management was
almost free from control by shareholders.
Japanese companies are, indeed, relatively free from shareholder control. A
majority of shares are held by stable corporate shareholders which tend not
to complain about the performance of a company because of Japan's system of
mutual shareholding.
The standard of care required of directors was also rather low compared to
the US. In recent years, some foreign investors, especially institutional
investors, have been horrified to find after buying Japanese shares how
little control they have over management.
Most of the changes to the commercial code are part of the effort to meet
their concerns. It is now, for example, mandatory for big companies to have
at least one external auditor, the equivalent of the English non-executive
director. Sumitomo Corporation has recently appointed a former prosecutor
general as its external auditor.
Companies are nervous of the changes to the code, particularly the steps
taken to make it easier to bring derivative actions. They fear shareholders
may initiate actions just to embarrass the company or for the purpose of
extortion. They worry that directors may become more timid in making
decisions.
The code has a potential safeguard against frivolous or vexatious actions,
empowering the courts to order the plaintiff to place a deposit if the
defendant requests one.
Others believe that, because derivative actions are time-consuming and do
not bring any direct financial benefit to the plaintiff, their number will
not increase dramatically. Yet many companies are investigating whether they
can insure their directors against derivative actions.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Business and the Law: DTI leaves it late in the day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eleventh-hour changes by the Department of Trade and Industry to UK
commercial agency rules designed to bring them into line with the rest of
the European Union from January 1, provoked widespread criticism from
British companies.
UK companies which had been advised to sack their commercial agents and
renegotiate their agency agreements or incur a cost of between Pounds 5,000
and Pounds 80,000 for each cancellation after January 1, were given just 10
days to make the necessary adjustments.
Their anger is understandable given that the EU directive on commercial
agents was adopted seven years ago and the DTI first consulted British
companies on its implementation back in 1987.
But as the furore dies down it appears the impact of the changes may not be
as great as first feared, particularly in relation to the method chosen by
companies for compensating sacked agents. Those companies which renegotiated
their agreements on the basis of the June draft of UK regulations may find
they have made the right choice after all.
The UK draft regulations are designed to give self-employed commercial
agents greater protection, making it harder for companies to terminate
agreements and guaranteeing agents compensation if sacked.
The regulations provide that compensation should be paid for damage suffered
by an agent as a result of the termination of an agreement. But after
industry complaints that the clause left companies open to the possibility
of paying unlimited damages, the government made a last-minute change to
allow businesses to cap compensation. Instead of paying damages companies
can agree to indemnify the agent for a sum equivalent to a maximum of one
year's commission.
The change has been welcomed by companies because of the greater flexibility
it affords in negotiating new agreements. But many lawyers believe in most
cases companies would be better off paying compensation rather than
indemnifying the agent.
According to City solicitors Baker &amp; McKenzie, any attempt to fix the
indemnity at less than one year's compensation would be open to review by
the English courts on the grounds that it does not adequately indemnify the
agent as the UK regulations require. Companies should therefore be prepared
to pay up to a year's commission before opting for an indemnity.
In addition, choosing the indemnity option would not prevent an agent from
seeking damages. Where the termination of an agreement amounts to a breach
of contract by the company the agent may be able to recover damages on top
of an indemnity.
By contrast any compensation paid to an agent must be linked to actual
damage. Damage will be deemed to have occurred where the agent is deprived
of commission to which he is entitled for services rendered under the terms
of the contract, and the company has received big benefits from the agent's
activities; and where the agent has not been able to depreciate his costs
and expenses.
According to Baker &amp; McKenzie, in cases where a company allows a fixed-term
agency agreement to expire without renewal or even where the company
terminates the contract in accordance with its terms, compensation should
only be payable if the agent has undepreciated costs and expenses. Baker &amp;
McKenzie says careful drafting of an agreement should ensure that an agent
is obliged to depreciate his costs early on, and prevent him from incurring
further expenditure.
The compensation payable by companies following termination of an agreement
should, therefore, be minimal and certainly less than an indemnity
equivalent to a maximum of one year's commission. Only in the rare
circumstances where the certainty offered by an indemnity is crucial will it
be the preferable option from a company's point of view.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Technology: Teddy gets interactive - Manufacturers are
seeking to produce cost-effective high-tech toys
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
High-tech toys may seem a contradiction to many people, but toy
manufacturers keep trying. Barbies with holographed ball gowns, teddy bears
which converse with television characters and interactive Sesame Street CDs
are a few of the futuristic playthings which have made their way onto store
shelves this Christmas.
Although novelties like these can offer a big payback at the cash register,
they can also be risky for manufacturers. High technology often implies high
cost, and toys are a low-cost industry. 'Most parents won't spend that much
on a toy,' says John Handy, vice-president in charge of design for Mattel
toys, a leading US toy maker. 'The vast majority of toys retail in the
Dollars 5 to Dollars 30 range, so we have to spin our magic with relatively
low-cost technology.'
Many manufacturers stumble on this point. The toy company, Worlds of Wonder,
for instance, thought it had hit the jackpot when it developed the 'Julie
Doll'. 'Julie' used advanced voice recognition techniques. For instance, if
a child expressed fatigue, the doll would recognise the word 'tired' and
respond 'I'm tired too; let's go to bed.' Although an enchanting plaything,
the project was scuppered by exorbitant production costs.
To make matters worse, children can be exacting customers. 'Children lose
interest easily, so the toys have to be extremely entertaining,' Handy
continues. 'They also have to be sturdy, able to withstand a lot of play,
and they have to meet very strict safety standards. Materials must be
non-toxic, and incapable of inflicting damage to small children.'
To meet the considerable challenge of designing high-tech toys,
manufacturers have developed various strategies. Yes] Entertainment
Corporation, a US toy maker, follows the maxim: 'Keep it simple'.
Yes] is putting out a product called TV Teddy, which interacts with
personalities on the television screen. Consumers receive video tapes when
they purchase the stuffed bear. The star of one of the tapes is Anthony, a
kindly gentleman with an affection for attics.
TV Teddy works through a radio signal sent out from the TV screen. 'We've
encoded extra audio information into a standard TV signal,' explains
Lawrence McKracken, director of engineering for the group. 'Most video
information contains a visual track and an audio track. Our third audio
track is picked up by the teddy bear.'
The technology is deceptively simple, yet the company says it can be adapted
to a number of different products. 'The most important thing is that there's
no limit to what Teddy can say,' says chairman and chief executive office
Donald Kingsboro. 'Is this the most sophisticated interactive technology
around? No. But the point is that it's available now, and it's cheap.' TV
Teddy retails for about Dollars 69 (Pounds 46).
Over the next few years, the company plans to launch what it calls a 'new
generation of multi-media toys'. TV Teddy will soon be able to interact with
regularly scheduled network programmes. Yes] has signed an agreement to have
the stuffed bear interact with an ABC Children's special sometime in early
1994, and says similar deals are in the pipeline.
'The next step is to have the child interact with the programme directly,'
says Kingsboro. 'We may provide a hand-held piece of plastic which kids
could enter answers on during children's game shows. Or promote a 'draw on
the screen' concept. Maybe not directly on the screen, because not many
parents want their children that close to the set. But on a hand-held video
picture which would also appear on the television screen.'
'Interactive' is a buzz word for toys this season, and Yes] is not the only
company capitalising on the new craze. Philips, the Dutch electronics group,
hopes for Christmas success with interactive CD/videos for children.
Philips has a very different formula than Yes] for keeping costs down. 'Our
philosophy is that if the parents buy the hardware for themselves, they'll
invest in extra software for the kids,' said David McElhatten, president of
the games division for Philips.
In October , Philips began putting out a sophisticated product which
connects CDs' audio capabilities with video technology. Dubbed 'CD-I' for
'compact disc-interactive', Philips's new CDs hold video games, and
feature-length films.
The technology is designed to give viewers more control over viewing and
listening habits. For instance, a work-out tape can be programmed
individually to play the music the consumer wants and the specific exercises
the consumer wants. Music CDs can be modified to exclude songs the listener
does not like, and Philips claims its videos and films are far more durable
than anything available in tape form.
Despite the technology's obvious appeal to adults, Philips says nearly 30
per cent of its software sales in CD-I are in children's entertainment. The
group is even selling large volumes of its hardware in toy stores like FAO
Schwarz. Children are offered a wide variety of video games to choose from,
with popular characters like the Sesame Street muppets and the Berenstain
Bears.
US toy manufacturers Hasbro and Mattel are treading yet another path to
cost-effective high-tech toys. Mattel has applied its colour-changing
technology to as many toys as possible in an attempt to lower development
costs. The manufacturer incorporates a temperature-sensitive paint into
everything from dolls to paints.
Li'l Miss Candi Stripes, for instance, sports a white bathing suit that
turns pink in cold water. Her blonde hair and lips also turn pink and orange
in the cold. Mattel has just expanded its colour-changing repertoire with a
new product, Solar Gak, a dough-like substance, which changes colour when
exposed to ultraviolet light (ie the sun).
Keeping an eye on the shrinking cost of various technologies is also
important, say toy manufacturers. Computer chips, for instance, were once
formidably expensive, but have now become so cheap that they can be widely
used in children's products.
Hasbro has capitalised on low-cost, high-memory chips to produce Talking
Barney, a stuffed green dinosaur which says 500 different phrases at random.
'Before, six or seven sayings were considered a lot,' says Sharon Hartley,
vice president of marketing for Playskool, the Hasbro division that makes
Talking Barney. 'But additional memory has become so cheap now that we've
been able to use it in a number of toys.'
With the cost of technology diminishing rapidly, toy manufacturers say their
products will soon use technologies once thought too expensive even for the
adult consumer market. 'We have to keep an eye on the technology market,
because it can help us provide that element of magic which is so important
in play,' says Hartley. 'And as these technologies get cheaper, they should
become increasingly easy for the toy market to tap.'

FT  21 DEC 93 / Technology: Europe's green seal - Recycling toner cartridges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest vending machine to appear in the office blocks of New York will
not be selling cups of coffee or chocolate bars but replacement toner
cartridges for the offices' laser printers.
Most importantly, the machine will only release a replacement cartridge if a
used one is inserted into the appropriate slot so that it can be recycled.
In the US the recycling of used toner cartridges is already a Dollars 500m
(Pounds 335m) business, with some 5,000 companies involved in the recycling.
That said, only 32 per cent of replacement cartridges are recycled.
In Europe even fewer cartridges are recycled. More than 90 per cent of
replacement cartridges bought contain no recycled parts. But with estimates
that by 1994-5 there will be more replacement cartridges sold in Europe than
in the US - 37m as opposed to 36m - European companies are beginning to take
a growing interest.
As many European business consumers know to their cost, the potentially huge
growth in the market has encouraged those wanting to make a fast buck - with
little heed for quality - to leap into the market.
With that in mind, a group of European cartridge recyclers will be getting
together this month to set up the Federation of European Cartridge Recyclers
and Suppliers (FECRS).
The aim of the FECRS is to test and monitor the quality of recycled
cartridges and to give those companies passing the rigorous screening
procedures the right to stamp the FECRS logo on their packaging. Recycling
involves replacing both the used toner and any other parts which are worn.
Steve Weedon, founding president of the FECRS, believes this stamp of
approval will give businesses the confidence to buy recycled cartridges.
With recycled cartridges costing 30 per cent less than new ones - typically
Pounds 45 rather than Pounds 70 in the UK - and the added bonus that the
recycled products are 'green', Weedon believes that quality assurance will
give the final fillip. 'It's an easy decision for companies to take. They've
got a good product at a good price and it's 'green'.'

FT  21 DEC 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Sharp gear change - How
Nissan suppliers are using training to fight hard times
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the canteen of Nissan Yamato Engineering's steel pressings plant on the
edge of Sunderland, a curious scene greets visitors.
At one end, the cooks are preparing lunch but the pepper pots and water jugs
on the tables have been pushed aside, to clear space for graphs and charts.
Poring over the paperwork are teams of overalled shopfloor workers.
Normally, these Wearside employees would be at home asleep, recovering from
the nightshift, or producing steel pressings and welded assemblies, mostly
for transportation every 15 minutes, under the Just in Time production
system, to the adjacent Nissan car plant.
Instead, for six weeks at a time, they are studying Total Productive
Maintenance and Data Analysis Problem Solving.
The reason for this sudden change of gear is the sharp downturn in the
Continental European car market. This has forced Nissan Motor Manufacturing
(UK), on which NYEL is totally dependent, to halve output from November 1993
to the end of February 1994 at its Pounds 900m Sunderland plant.
The nightshift has been suspended and Nissan's 2,400 production staff put
onto alternate weeks on day shift for the four months. An 'agreed separation
programme' has been launched, offering volunteers six months pay to leave.
So far over 250 have gone but Nissan will not say yet how many more it
expects to shed.
The original 1993 production target was 270,000. Output levels for 1994 are
expected to be between 200,000 and 240,000 cars but the final figure will
not be certain until the new year.
Nissan's immediate problems, and uncertainty over next year's production
target, are a painful headache for the eight synchronous and Just In Time
suppliers set up nearby since the mid-1980s to serve the car plant.
Its 1994 output target and the detailed breakdown between models and
specifications provide vital planning information for these factories whose
output goes mainly - in some cases solely - to Nissan.
Most had intended to diversify their customer base but the European downturn
bit before the majority of the factories, mostly under five years old, had
tied up many other deals. A number are at present actively seeking new
customers, but the downturn throughout the automotive industry has depressed
prospects.
For most, stockpiling is not an option because they are intimately locked
into Nissan's production cycle; for example, a carpet is fitted into a
Sunderland-made car precisely 42 minutes after the nearby Sommer Industrie
carpet plant receives the order.
Nor are redundancies an easy option for suppliers imbued with the culture of
continuous improvement - or Kaizen as the Japanese call it. Their carefully
selected workforces have been encouraged to unstinting effort by the
expectation of secure employment.
Moreover, sacrificing expensively trained, high quality employees could
prove shortsighted if, as the motor trade hopes, the European market picks
up before too long.
Even so, the philosophy of job security is under severe strain; exhaust
system maker Calsonic has shed 37 people, a quarter of its workforce, and
brake and fuel line supplier Bundy a dozen, from a workforce of 53. Car seat
supplier Ikeda Hoover, which employs 490, is to make between 20 and 90
people redundant, and Nissan Yamato, 80 per cent Nissan owned, has launched
its own agreed separation programme.
But, more unusually, the suppliers have been minimising or preventing
redundancies by launching ambitious attempts to win long-term advantage from
adversity. Capitalising on the extra employee time available due to the
production downturn, they have brought forward training programmes, stepped
up brainstorming on quality and submitted their line layouts and production
methods to exhaustive analysis.
'Our philosophy is to strengthen the organisation; although it's a difficult
position at the moment, we firmly believe there's a very good long term
future for ourselves and NMUK,' says Phil Manning, personnel manager at
Hashimoto's Boldon plant, a synchronous supplier to Nissan of metal and
plastic body fitting parts. Output at Hashimoto has virtually halved but, so
far, all 295 employees remain.
Sommer Industrie is committed to retaining its 105 employees at least until
the end of February. Those not needed for production are working on
improvements to organisation, quality, costs and delivery.
The sheer size of the Nissan workforce means half its production employees
must stay at home each week at present; the plant cannot accommodate them
all at once.
But the suppliers , with their smaller workforces, have opted to bring all
their employees into work each day so those not on production work undertake
purposeful improvement activities.
Even the basic logistics can be difficult; at NYEL, where 160 of the 580
employees are normally on nightshift, a temporary additional car park had to
be built, costing several thousand pounds.
The 8am start has been staggered, with employees arriving from 6am to avoid
traffic congestion. And the canteen is doubling up as a training area since
none of the meeting rooms is big enough.
'It's a four-month opportunity for us,' says NYEL general manager Mr Brian
Cobb. 'Things are going to pick up and we want to be ready for them.' But he
adds: 'I hope it doesn't last too long.'
As well as bringing forward training in subjects like transfer press
technology, NYEL is stepping up training for shopfloor workers in
maintenance techniques and reviewing production line layout. Moving
equipment in one cell has saved about five square metres; significant when
multiplied.
NYEL has volunteers for its agreed separation programme. Some are young
bachelors tempted by the chance of a lump sum to clear off debts. Others are
family men who have calculated that, without the 16.6 per cent shift bonus
for night work, they would be better off unemployed than on the production
staff's Pounds 11,600 basic rate.
For many, the intensive training weeks are a welcome break from repetitive
production work, although tinged with anxiety. 'A lot of people are pleased
in some respects to get off production but they're concerned what the final
outcome will be,' says Andy Seddon, a Kaizen technician.
As yet, it is unclear what 1994 will bring these men and their workmates,
although NYEL is adamant there will be no enforced redundancies.
'Like the rest of the supply group, we're just waiting to see,' says Mr
Cobb.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Coming to terms with
Europe's late payers - Exporters need a strategy for collecting overdue
bills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The arrival of the single European market - and more recently sterling's
exit from the exchange rate mechanism - has encouraged more British
companies to think of exporting to the Continent.
But what awaits the British exporter across the Channel? One answer is even
longer delays before payment than they currently endure in the UK.
This may surprise smaller British companies who believe they already wait an
inordinate length of time at home and are lobbying the government for a
statutory right to interest on overdue bills.
But Italian companies, for example, settle their bills on average after 130
days - compared with payment terms in the UK of 60-90 days. French
companies, Europe's second slowest payers, settle after 121 days, according
to the Association of British Factors and Discounters.
Both countries' payment records have deteriorated over the past year and
even the Germans, usually considered among Europe's promptest payers, are
making their suppliers wait longer.
By contrast, UK companies paid their bills this year in 59 days compared
with 62 days last year, says the ABFD.
Exporters to Scandinavia, Switzerland and the Netherlands are most likely to
be paid on time.
According to the ABFD some continental European customers offer to pay on
time only if their suppliers accept discounts. In Spain and Italy these
discounts have reached as high as 20 per cent.
There are, however, ways in which the exporters, usually the slowest to
collect, can reduce the risk of late payment. Finding the right distributor
is essential, although smaller companies with limited management resources
inevitably find it difficult to discover who is likely to pay on time and
who is not.
One solution is to use a factoring service to help vet distributors'
credit-worthiness and manage the sales ledger.
Eighteen months ago late payment by Italian customers was hampering the
rapid expansion of Micra Instruments, a small Luton-based manufacturer of
surgical instruments which exports most of its production. The company
turned to Alex Lawrie, a Lloyds Bank subsidiary, which immediately helped
Micra to change some of its distributors and rapidly improved its cash flow.
Alex Lawrie also formalised credit controls and introduced a discipline
Micra previously lacked.
'We have learnt about the realistic establishment of credit limits,' says
Peter Richardson, managing director. 'Anyone can ship product and not get
paid for it.' Foreign customers are now allowed a tightly controlled amount
of credit. 'You have to be ruthless. As much as this might hurt your
business it is better not to supply than not to get paid.'
Factors argue that their services are particularly useful to companies like
Micra Instruments which are growing rapidly and need to increase cash flow.
A factoring facility is 'dynamic' in that it allows a company to raise more
cash as its sales ledger grows - it will typically be advanced up to 80 per
cent of the value of its invoices, depending on their credit-worthiness. An
overdraft limit, by contrast, will generally not grow as sales increase.
Factoring does not have the best of names. It is still frequently seen as a
service required only by banks' poorest credit risks. But Michael Hulme,
managing director of Naturaldata, a Lancaster-based company which writes
software to help companies control the cost of factoring, says it is
particularly suited to exporters.
'Sales-based companies are often not very good at managing credit control,'
Hulme says. 'Factoring companies help on the credit control side.'

FT  21 DEC 93 / Technology: Homing in on a new market - Microsoft's plans
for PCs in the house
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOF WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Microsoft wants to get into your home. The world's largest personal computer
software company has announced an ambitious strategy to accelerate its
participation in the home computer market and to change the way computers
are used in the home.
The company has launched a new brand to handle this task - Microsoft Home -
and says that the home computer products to be sold under the brand already
contribute Dollars 200m (Pounds 134.2m) in annual revenues to Microsoft. The
company's chairman and co-founder Bill Gates predicts dramatic further
growth in this sector.
He cites a recent survey by the Connecticut-based Inteco Corporation - which
revealed that more than 27 per cent of US homes already have at least one
PC, and that 31 per cent plan to buy one. In homes where children are of
school age the percentage jumps to 62 per cent. These figures also show that
5.5m homes plan to buy a PC in the next year.
All this is fertile ground for Microsoft, which has until now only toyed
with the home market through a diverse range of products. The company
currently has some 35 software titles for home users, but plans to expand
that to more than 100 within the next year.
Microsoft has formed partnerships with banks, educational institutions and
even parent-teacher associations to develop and promote new applications for
home computers.
In the short term, the most important of these will be what Microsoft calls
'edutainment' packages - which teach children new skills, introduce them to
new ideas and help them to absorb information by playing games and creating
stories and pictures. Such software includes electronic encyclopaedias,
reference works about everything from dinosaurs to Beethoven, and children's
creativity applications.
A vital technological key to the success of these developments is Compact
Disc Read Only Memory (CD-Rom). This is a storage medium based on the same
compact disc technology as used in stereo equipment, but storing huge
amounts of computer data (up to 600Mb - or about 400 times the amount
available on the average computer floppy disc). It allows software producers
a low-cost way of offering 'multimedia' applications that can hold hundreds
of pictures, film clips, spoken words and music.
Gates estimates that within 18 months, all popular makes of computer will be
shipped with CD-Rom drives and sound capabilities and predicts that more
than one million similarly equipped PCs will have been sold by the end of
this year.
Gates predicts that home computers will be more than just study aids for
children and has negotiated agreements with several financial services
companies to offer home banking services. Users will gain access to the
services through the Microsoft Money financial management software package.
All these products and services, however, are a prelude to the realisation
of a much broader vision of home computing that Gates has often outlined.
Microsoft is a stong proponent of the development of interactive telvision
and the so-called 'digital highway' under discussion in the US. Gates
suggests that as more homes use computers, and hook up to digital
information links, it will be only a matter of time before the computer,
telephone, television and on-line information services converge into a
single system for handling all home entertainment, education, information
and communication needs.
Microsoft could, however, face an uphill battle. To start with none of its
ideas on home computing are particularly new.
Microsoft also faces competition. California-based Intuit, for example, has
also made an agreement with the many US banks that have links to Visa.
And telecommunications giant AT&amp;T has announced that it, too, is entering
the home software business with plans to license home shopping software.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Flaws in the German model
 -How a statutory system works in practice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British businesses clamouring for a statutory right to interest on overdue
bills often look to Germany as a model.
But since the recession set in there it is more common to hear the German
experience cited by UK opponents of legislation as an example of why it
would not work.
In Germany suppliers have recourse in the courts against late payers, and
can charge a legally-specified rate of interest on overdue accounts. Under
commercial law the supplier may charge interest of 5 per cent on overdue
amounts once it has issued three reminders (the last one typically a formal
warning of late payment) or when payment has not been made by a mutually
agreed date.
The problem is the practice. 'The 5 per cent level was fixed a long time ago
and is not commercially realistic,' says Carl August Hartmann, at Dr Kocke &amp;
Partner. 'It is possible to obtain from the courts a further payment
designed to compensate for interest payments that you yourself are obliged
to pay at commercial rates as a result of the customer's late payment.'
In practice few companies exercise their legal rights - to do so would be
deemed a hostile gesture which would jeopardise normal commercial relations
with a customer. As a result the late payment problem has got worse during
the economic downturn, and is partly responsible for the increase in
corporate insolvencies in Germany this year to a new post-war peak.
In an effort to make UK legislation workable, campaigners may argue that the
interest claimed against a customer - possibly a punitive one  - should be
accrued until the day the company ceases to be a supplier. At that point the
claim would be presented.
Unreformed late-paying customers might also be required to include any late
payment interest that they might one day be called to pay as a contingent
liability on their balance sheets. The accounts of some of the UK's largest
companies would therefore make interesting reading.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sweeping reforms to the Trades Union Congress were agreed yesterday by the
TUC's finance and general purposes committee. They mark the largest shake-up
of internal structure for more than 70 years.
All the main TUC policy committees are to be abolished from next March.
These cover economic policy, European strategy, international affairs,
health, education and equal rights. The finance and general purposes
committee is to be transformed into a new executive which will meet once a
month.
The TUC general council is also to be reformed with a reduction in its
number of meetings to five a year instead of 12. Outside speakers are to be
invited to give presentations to the general council on policy issues.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Wanamaker's dream lives on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'It's business as usual. The Globe will open in April 1995, just as Sam
would have wished.'
That was the predictably defiant stance from the Shakespeare Globe Trust
yesterday as it came to terms with the death over the weekend of Sam
Wanamaker, the US actor who devoted the last 24 years of his life to
building a new Globe Theatre on London's Bankside. The replica is within
yards of the location of the Elizabethan Globe, the theatre which
Shakespeare part-owned and which first staged many of his plays.
Mr Wanamaker, who had been suffering from cancer for many years, died aged
74 just as the Pounds 20m project, the source of many disappointments and
setbacks, was starting to rise on the south bank of the Thames. The first
eight bays of the 20-bay theatre, with wooden walls, a thatched roof, and
open to the sky, were unveiled last January.
Mr Wanamaker was winning over his opponents. The original hostility of
Southwark Council to the scheme has turned to support. Business was backing
him. The Globe Trust has raised Pounds 10m, and only another Pounds 2m is
needed to complete the 1,500-place theatre. But a further Pounds 8m is
needed to finish the one-acre site and make the project's financial future
more certain. The planned pub and restaurant, 300-seat studio theatre,
Shakespeare museum and library, and offices should ensure its viability.
The recent discovery of the remains of the original Globe and Rose theatres
has increased interest in the area. An Underground station at Southwark on
the new line to Canary Wharf will bring an audience close to the Globe, and
there is a good chance that the Tate Gallery of Modern Art will be built
alongside it at Bankside.
Mr Wanamaker must have died with his faith in his life's work intact.

<TEXT>
BOC, the industrial gases company, is to save Pounds 300,000 a year on its
electricity bill after becoming the first industrial company since
electricity privatisation to start drawing a large power supply direct from
the National Grid, Michael Smith writes.
The deal for the company's Pounds 45m production and distribution complex at
Brinsworth, near Rotherham, South Yorkshire, means it will not need to use
or pay for the distribution network of Yorkshire Electricity. The site will
be supplied by Hydro-Electric, with which BOC has an agreement for large
sites.
The saving represents about 10 per cent of the Brinsworth plant's
electricity bill.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Big electricity users back down in dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pressure on Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, to
reach a compromise with generators National Power and PowerGen increased
yesterday when big energy users backed down from their insistence that the
generators should be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
The Major Energy Users' Council said that there was no need for a referral
if changes were made to the way prices were determined in the wholesale
electricity pool.
Mr Peter Rost, chairman, said: 'This offers an escape route from a
monopolies inquiry, which would involve delay and uncertainty.' He wanted
the government to use the coming sale of its 40 per cent stake in the
generators to create additional companies in the market.
Prof Littlechild said last week that he would decide on a reference by
mid-January.
The change of stance from the council is significant because the
organisation represents influential organisations including Marks and
Spencer and the National Health Service.
Its preference for a negotiated settlement over pool prices means that
virtually all interested parties have expressed a desire for referral to be
avoided.
The council's policy shift follows its commissioning of a report, by Ilex
Associates, the consultancy, which was published yesterday. Ilex concludes
that the generators' rates of return are 'arguably higher' than appropriate
when there is surplus capacity but are not excessive.
It suggests the pool-price determination should be changed so that it
reflects more accurately the costs of generation. In part this would be
achieved by increasing capacity-related payments.
Greater variation between peak and off-peak prices would result.
Ilex says the regulator could bring about such change but would have to
regulate the pool-price bidding system. The objective would be to 'curb
National Power's and PowerGen's ability to gain excessive profits through
their manipulation of pool prices'.
Ilex says prices for household consumers would increase only marginally by
0.06p per kilowatt hour but those for base-load industrial customers could
fall 0.3p per kwh on average in the middle of the decade.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Recovery hopes dented by weak bank lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Exceptionally weak bank lending figures out yesterday underlined the
continuing reluctance of consumers and companies to take on new debts.
Bank of England data showed that sterling lending to the private sector  -
M4 lending - was only Pounds 0.5bn in November compared with the previous
month's Pounds 1.8bn.
The year-on-year growth rate stayed flat at 3 per cent, just marginally
higher than the 30-year low of 2.9 per cent recorded in July.
Economists said the figures were not encouraging for recovery prospects. Mr
Ian Shepherdson of Midland Global Markets said the sluggishness of lending
probably reflected 'massive uncertainty' before last month's Budget.
M4 itself - the broad measure of the money supply - rose a seasonally
adjusted 0.4 per cent in November compared with October, to stand 4.9 per
cent up on a year ago.
The Bank said the pick-up in M4 was being driven mainly by government gilts
sales rather than by growth in lend-ing to the private sector.
Other figures yesterday from the British Bankers' Association showed that
lending by the UK's main banking groups was strong in November.
The seasonally adjusted statistics showed very strong lending to the
financial sector, a steady growth in mortgage lending, but falls in lending
to most other categories including manufacturers, wholesalers, property and
construction companies.
Overall, lending rose by Pounds 2.08bn, slightly higher than October's
Pounds 1.94bn increase. The November rise would have been larger had two
banks not securitised some of their personal loans.
Commenting on the figures, Lord Inchyra, director-general of the BBA, said:
'After making allowance for the two securitisations this month, it would
seem that there was some pick-up in consumer borrowing.'
Mr John Ecklin, director of statistics at the BBA, said the difference
between the association's figures and the M4 lending figure mainly reflected
big net repayments of company debt to banks that are not part of the nine
main groups.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Interest rates sap building society funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Total retail funds in building societies fell last month for only the second
time in the societies' history, reflecting increased competition for savings
at a time of low interest rates.
Figures for November released by the Building Societies' Association
yesterday show that there was a net outflow of funds from societies of
Pounds 400m.
This represents the largest monthly fall since September 1986, when savers
withdrew money to invest in the TSB flotation.
In previous months the falls in retail deposits have been more than offset
by the amount of interest credited to accounts, but last month only some
Pounds 262m of interest was credited.
Mr John Wriglesworth, housing analyst at UBS, said no permanent damage had
been done to societies in spite of months of severe competition,
particularly from banks, both for mortgage lending and for personal savings.
He attributed the outflow of funds to a combination of low interest rates,
competition from the government through national savings products, and the
attractions of investing in the stock market, but said that the sector was
still 'resilient'.
On mortgage lending there were some signs that the societies might be
beginning to regain market share from the banks, with net advances of
principal at Pounds 880m, which was the second successive monthly rise.
Net new commitments were Pounds 2.78bn in November, also higher than in
October, when they were Pounds 2.54bn.
Monthly figures issued by the British Bankers' Association showed banks' net
mortgage lending at Pounds 861m in November, while their personal deposits
were down by Pounds 134m.
Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the BSA, said that the scale of savings
withdrawals was surprising, but that it might reflect 'distortions
associated with the Budget and a larger than normal depletion of savings in
the run-up to Christmas'.
Mr Coles added that the BSA did not suggest that there would be a shortage
of mortgages when the housing market recovered. Societies still had access
to funding on the wholesale markets, and few were close to the regulatory
limits on this type of funding.
He argued also that a housing recovery tended to generate its own funds as,
for example, people were more easily able to sell property they had
inherited.
The last time the amount of retail savings in societies had fallen against
the previous month was, he added, in November 1990, when savers withdrew
money to invest in the privatisation of the regional electricity companies.
Societies are likely to show an increase in retail savings over the fourth
quarter of the year, as even if there are further withdrawals, December is a
month when large amounts of interest are credited.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Ministry to review defence purchasing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Changes in the way the Ministry of Defence handles arms purchases and
training are being considered in an effort to save hundreds of millions of
pounds on the annual defence budget from 1996.
The targets of the review range from financial management and computer
systems to recruitment and promotional activities - including showpieces
such as the RAF's Red Arrows and the army's parachute display team.
The ministry aims to save money by scrapping some of the security
precautions set up during the cold war and reducing the number of people
subjected to 'positive vetting'.
Officials have identified 15 areas for examination by specialised teams
under the defence-cost study announced after the November Budget.
The study is aimed at helping the ministry save about Pounds 1bn in its
annual spending from the 1996-97 financial year without damaging
effectiveness.
The drastic nature of the cuts means that ideas previously regarded as
'out-of-bounds' are likely to be included in initial proposals put to
ministers in three or four months. One official said the question now was:
'Which sacred cows will have to be shot?'
The biggest savings are expected to come from procurement, where options are
being considered for leasing, acquisition of second-hand vehicles and other
equipment, increased competition in collaborative international projects and
greater use of private-sector finance.
Officials will seek to draw lessons from close scrutiny of several large
projects, such as the proposed new Anglo-French-Italian frigate.
Significant economies are expected in repairs, spares supply, storage and
freight, possibly though private contractors. Manufacturers may be required
to provide in-service support for the equipment they supply.
Training is also seen as a source of big savings, particularly in RAF flying
instruction - the initial stage of which is already privatised - and the
army. A review of property management is likely to lead to the sale of some
of the more commercially attractive pieces of ministry property.
Also under investigation are the ministry's head office and procurement
staff, together employing about 8,000, and the 5,000-strong ministry police.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Balance sheets bolstered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies have used higher demand and falling interest rates to reduce
borrowings and push balance sheets to their strongest level for seven years,
government figures show.
The healthier state of much of industry is also underlined by a large
increase in trading profits in the latest quarter, and a rise in capital
spending after a sluggish period early this year.
In the third quarter companies turned in an overall financial surplus of
Pounds 1.726bn at current prices. That compares with a deficit - an excess
of spending to receipts - of Pounds 543m in the second quarter.
Business also reduced its borrowing requirement over the two quarters, to
Pounds 2.748bn from Pounds 6.726bn. The figures illustrate how company
finances, which had been deeply in the red before and during the recession,
have improved in two years.
In 1990 companies chalked up a record deficit of Pounds 22.753bn. They
borrowed Pounds 36.965bn to cover the deficit and used other financial
transactions such as overseas capital spending and share investments.
In the first nine months of this year, the surplus of receipts over spending
for companies was Pounds 2.267bn, after a Pounds 6.758bn deficit last year.
The third-quarter surplus was the highest for any quarter since late 1986,
while the last time companies recorded a surplus for the whole year was in
1987.
Between July and September, gross trading profits of companies net of stock
appreciation came to Pounds 22.735bn, a 15 per cent rise on a year
previously.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Service sector and consumers lift economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The economy expanded more quickly in the third quarter than previously
thought, thanks largely to relatively high growth in service industries and
consumer spending.
In the latest quarter gross domestic product grew 2.1 per cent from a year
earlier. The previous estimate was 1.9 per cent.
A big factor explaining the higher growth was the 2.6 per cent year-on-year
growth in the third quarter in consumer spending, particularly on furniture,
carpets and cars.
Between July and September service-sector output expanded 2.4 per cent on a
year earlier, with an especially sharp growth in retailing, hotels and
catering and financial services.
Excluding oil and gas extraction, the economy in the third quarter grew 1.8
per cent on the year, higher than the 1.6 per cent previous estimate. This
measure of output was up 0.5 per cent compared with the previous quarter,
after 0.4 per cent quarterly growth recorded between April and June.
The figures from the Central Statistical Office are adjusted for seasonal
changes and inflation. They indicate that people have gradually increased
their spending under the influence of lower interest rates, a fall in saving
and a slow rise in personal incomes, due partly to falling unemployment.
In the third quarter the savings ratio - personal savings as a percentage of
personal disposable income - was 10.6 per cent after 11.7 per cent between
April and June. After averaging 12.6 per cent during last year, the ratio in
the latest quarter was at its lowest since the fourth quarter of 1991.
Unadjusted for inflation, personal disposable income increased a quarterly
0.3 per cent in the third three-month period, to show a 3.1 per cent rise on
the year.
Manufacturers have benefited from export volumes holding up reasonably well,
while in the third quarter construction output rose a real,
inflation-adjusted 0.2 per cent on the previous three months, the first
quarter-on-quarter increase for three years.
Among individual service sectors, distribution - including retailing,
catering and hotels - increased output 3.4 per cent in the last quarter on a
year previously and 1 per cent on the quarter.
Financial services, and transport and communication saw comparable figures
of 3.2 per cent and 0.5 per cent, and 1.5 per cent and 0.4 per cent.
In other highlights from the figures:
Total gross domestic product increased 0.6 per cent in the third quarter on
the previous three months. In the first nine months of the year the economy
expanded 1.75 per cent on the comparable period last year. In the third
quarter consumer spending was 1 per cent higher than between April and June.
Spending on furniture, floor coverings and cars was 20.6 per cent, 17.5 per
cent and 9.6 per cent higher than in the equivalent period last year, with
these three areas showing quarterly rises of 5.6 per cent, 4.5 per cent and
4 per cent. In the third quarter total gross domestic product was 1.3 per
cent lower than at the last peak in output in early 1990, but 2.5 per cent
higher than at the bottom of the recession in the second quarter of last
year.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Treasury to repay Ecu5bn loan ahead of its final maturity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury is to repay, ahead of its final maturity, an Ecu5bn seven-year
revolving bank credit that was arranged in September last year to help
support the pound against severe foreign exchange pressure, Tracy Corrigan
writes.
The move reflects the recovery in the level of the UK's foreign-exchange
reserves since the events surrounding Black Wednesday last year.
Tranches of the credit, which is currently fully drawn, will be repaid
successively over the next four months, at respective roll-over dates. The
repayment will come from foreign currency resources. Some Ecu3.5bn will be
financed from forward purchases of foreign exchange set aside for the
purpose; the rest will be drawn from foreign-exchange reserves.
Foreign-exchange and gold reserves stood at Dollars 43.6bn at the end of
November, and are expected to rise further in 1994 with issues under the
three-year Ecu Treasury note programme.

Employers are failing to recognise a skills gap at the lower end of the jobs
market which could be plugged by the use of older workers, a survey of

The survey showed that while employers were becoming slightly more receptive
to the recruitment of the over-35s there remained a deeply entrenched
tendency to recruit from people aged 18 to 35.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Current account deficit lowest for two years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The current account deficit in the third quarter was the lowest for two
years, on the back of a healthy surplus on earnings from financial services
and relatively fast growth in merchandise exports.
The deficit came to Pounds 1.613bn, after Pounds 2.348bn in the second
quarter. Between July and September, Britain had a surplus on invisible
trade - services, profits and dividends and other financial transfers - of
Pounds 777m compared with Pounds 708m in the previous quarter.
The invisibles surplus offset the difference between merchandise imports and
exports - the visible trade gap - in the third quarter. This was a
relatively low Pounds 2.39bn, after Pounds 3.056bn in the second
three-monthly period.
In the first nine months of the year the current account deficit came to a
seasonally adjusted Pounds 6.644bn after Pounds 8.547bn in the whole of last
year. In its Budget forecast last month the Treasury said the current
account deficit for 1993 would be Pounds 9.5bn.
The current account deficit in the third quarter was covered by a surplus on
Britain's capital account, helped by record purchases of UK government gilts
by overseas groups.
In the third quarter Britain had a Pounds 2.974bn surplus on trade with
other countries in financial services including banking and insurance,
compared with a surplus of Pounds 2.543bn in the second quarter.
This large excess of exports to imports in this sector of the services
industry offset deficits in other services - for instance the travel trade
saw a Pounds 904m deficit in the third quarter and civil aviation a deficit
of Pounds 117m.
Britain earned a surplus of Pounds 1.037bn on interest, profits and
dividends in the third quarter, after Pounds 876m in the second quarter.
There was, however, a Pounds 1.663bn deficit on general financial transfers
 -also part of the invisibles account - in the latest three-monthly period
after Pounds 1.166bn between April and June. Much of this deficit was due to
a large net payment of Pounds 1.595bn from the UK to overseas government
institutions, mainly the European Union, in the latest quarter.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Openness on lottery bids allowed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Applicants for the licence to run the UK's multi-billion-pound National
Lottery will be able to make as much information about their bids public as
they wish.
The move to potentially greater openness represents a change of heart by Mr
Peter Davis, director-general of the National Lottery.
Last month's draft rules set out rigid conditions of confidentiality for all
applicants.
The draft documents said they would 'be required formally to agree' that
neither they nor the director-general would be allowed to publish anything
but the names and addresses of applicants without the approval of the other.
Mr Davis originally said he thought that both press and public risked being
'confused' by the release of incomplete information. He has changed his mind
after considering a number of submissions arguing for greater openness.
Mr Richard Branson, the Virgin Group chairman bidding on the understanding
that all profits will go to a charitable foundation, said there was a duty
to publish details of a bid and its strengths.
It is believed that when the licence conditions are published today they
will give the freedom Mr Branson and others asked for.
At least eight groups have said they will apply, or are seriously
considering applying.
Meanwhile, Mr Des Wilson of Mr Branson's UK Lottery Foundation declined to
give details of how the group planned to raise the multi-million finance it
would need without an equity base. He said only that talks with a bank were
nearing completion

FT  21 DEC 93 / Gummer snubbed on reform of councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Local Government Commission has backtracked on its proposals to abolish
Gloucestershire county council and to replace the present two-tier council
structure with unitary authorities. Instead, it is 'with regret'
recommending the status quo.
The proposal comes after Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, said
that he wanted to see unitary authorities replacing the two-tier system even
if this involved extra costs. It seems almost certain to provoke further
conflict between the commission and the government.
Sir John Banham, commission chairman, said Mr Gummer would be 'extremely
unwise' to ask the commission to reconsider before he had studied its
report.
He said: 'Our job is not to serve up something we know the secretary of
state will accept but to discharge our responsibilities.'
The commission did confirm its proposals to abolish Avon and Somerset county
councils in its final recommendations, published yesterday.
It rejects the case for a greater Bristol, which the business community and
city council have been pressing for. It proposes the city should become a
unitary authority in its existing boundaries.
Sir John said there was 'an astonishing level of support for reform' in Avon
and Somerset. But in Gloucestershire there was more support for retaining
the two-tier structure than for any other option.
Originally the commission proposed three unitary authorities to replace
Gloucestershire county council and the six district councils, but Sir John
said these had been unable to agree on a viable structure. He said the
commission regretted its failure to recommend unitary councils but it would
be irresponsible to propose change unless there was support by 'local
champions' for a new structure.
Mr Doug Henderson, Labour's local government spokesman, described the
proposals as a 'dog's breakfast'. He said: 'Of the first six areas covered,
five different solutions have been proposed, and the secretary of state has
rejected one of them.'
Gloucestershire county council welcomed the recommendation. Mr Michael
Honey, chief executive, said: 'The public want local authorities to continue
providing services - not having costly change forced upon them.'
Mr John Cripps, chief executive of Gloucestershire chamber of commerce and
industry, said: 'The status quo is the most acceptable of unacceptable
options at present. The whole thing has been a muddle from start to finish.'
For Somerset, the commission has changed its original proposals to create a
single authority covering most of the county. It now suggests three unitary
authorities after a MORI poll showed strong support for this.
The commissioners said there was very little public support for the
retention of Avon county, and it proposes four unitary authorities instead.
Mr Chris Curtis, the south-west regional director for the Confederation of
British Industry, said: 'We think in the very short term the decision not to
expand Bristol will be seen as a serious setback for trade and business, not
just in Bristol but in the area generally.' The decision on Gloucestershire
was 'quite incomprehensible'.
Mr John Savage, chief executive of Bristol Chamber of Commerce and
Initiative, said: 'There is absolutely no sign that the commission has
listened to the voice of the informed business community, despite all the
research we have carried out into the need for larger boundaries to make
Bristol the hub of a progressive economic region.'

Civil service unions yesterday rejected an offer from Mr John Major, the
prime minister, to resolve the continuing dispute over trade union
membership at GCHQ, Britain's electronic listening post based at Cheltenham,
Gloucestershire. Unions were banned at the organisation 10 years ago.
Mr Major was repeating a suggestion put forward several weeks ago by Sir
Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary, that the staff federation at GCHQ
should be allowed to affiliate with the Council of Civil Service Unions.
The proposal was rejected by union leaders, who left a 45-minute meeting at
Downing Street saying that the prime minister had placed nothing new on the
table. Mr Bill Brett, general secretary of the Institution of Professionals
Managers and Specialists, who led the union delegation, said: 'We rejected
the staff federation offer because it is irrelevant to the real issue.'
He added: 'It was a civilised meeting but did not have a civilised ending.
The problem is in the minds of ministers, no one else.'
Mr Barry Reamsbottom, general secretary of the Civil and Public Services
Association, said Mr Major's message was exactly the same when the unions
were first banned in 1984. 'The bottom line is still the same,' he said.
'The government believes that national loyalty is not compatible with trade
union membership.'
A demonstration is being planned in Cheltenham next month to mark the 10th
anniversary of the ban, and the government faces being censured by the
International Labour Organisation.
Mr Major, accompanied by Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, told the
officials he was not hostile to trade unions but had not changed his mind
about an 'inherent conflict of interest' involved in belonging to a union in
such a sensitive job.
The prime minister's stance was criticised afterwards by opposition parties.
Mr Nigel Jones, Liberal Democrat MP for Cheltenham, said: 'The prime
minister is breaking international law. He knows that what the government
did 10 years ago was illegal, but he does not have the courage to say so and
put right a wrong which has lasted a decade.'

FT  21 DEC 93 / BCCI 'presented false accounts for a decade'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A small group of trusted officials at Bank of Credit and Commerce
International presented false accounts over nearly a decade to deceive the
government of Abu Dhabi over how its money was being used, the government's
lawyers said yesterday.
Several senior executives in BCCI's headquarters in Leadenhall Street,
London, and in ICIC, a subsidiary in the Cayman Islands, fabricated
valuation statements of Abu Dhabi's money while spending the cash to prop up
the loss-making bank.
The details of their claim emerged from a briefing by lawyers at Simmons &amp;
Simmons, a London-based firm of solicitors, as they announced a Dollars 7bn
civil case against 13 former executives of the bank in Abu Dhabi.
From November 1980 to March 1990 Dollars 2.6bn in the private funds of
Sheikh Zayed and Crown Prince Khalifa of Abu Dhabi was entrusted to BCCI, at
the instigation of Mr Hasan Abedi, the founder of the bank.
The money was invested in account 20071 in ICIC in regular instalments
throughout the decade, then distributed to dozens of sub-accounts in BCCI
branches around the world.
About Dollars 600m went to prop up the Gulf Group, a Pakistan-based shipping
conglomerate with delinquent loans, and Dollars 1bn in the purchase of BCCI
shares and notes. The rest went to support other failed loans, and the
bank's Treasury division, which lost more than Dollars 1.8bn in 1980-87.
An elaborate system of dual accounting developed, by which the bank would
spend the money and then prepare regular falsified valuation statements
showing how the funds were supposedly being invested and earning interest.
By 1989 BCCI was telling Abu Dhabi that the portfolio was worth Dollars
4.3bn. But just Dollars 150m was left in the account when BCCI was closed in
July 1991 and the only other money returned to the government was Dollars
450m it requested back in 1988-89.
In an internal note in 1985 Mr Swaleh Naqvi, chief operating officer of the
bank, makes reference to a 'number of transactions we will not be able to
explain'. The funds typically moved along a tortuous route which made
tracing transactions difficult. Money was transferred through intermediaries
before being dispersed.
Only after four years of pressure from Abu Dhabi for an audit of its
portfolio did BCCI hire a small local firm to carry out the work in 1988.
The reports do not express any concerns about the recoverability of the
assets, and state that the valuations provided to Abu Dhabi show a 'true and
fair view'.
Abu Dhabi says it was only when the demands on BCCI dwarfed the remaining
funds in the portfolio in April 1990 that the misappropriation was
uncovered, when Mr Naqvi confessed and sought new funds. Abu Dhabi then
began an investigation.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Lautro seeks drop-out rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Life insurance companies would have to draw up standardised statistics about
the rates at which people give up long-term investment policies under
proposals published yesterday by the sector's regulator.
Persistency - the extent to which customers stay with policies - is seen as
an important indicator of whether they were suitably advised.
So far it has been difficult to compare the performance of companies because
statistics have not been collected on a standard basis.
Lautro, the self-regulating organisation for the life insurance industry,
issued a consultation paper on establishing a basis for compiling
persistency figures.
Earlier this month Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading,
renewed his call for life companies to have to publish how many clients
cancel policies in the early years.
Lautro's central proposal is to measure the number of premiums still being
paid in the 13th month. Information about premiums maintained in the 25th
and 37th months would also be collected.
A range of products would be covered, including endowments and pensions,
about which there has been the most concern, as well as unit trusts and
personal equity plans.

The High Court yesterday upheld the decision by the Corporation of London to
raise the rents of Smithfield traders to pay for refurbishment.
Traders are considering an appeal. They are also lodging an objection to a

FT  21 DEC 93 / North Sea oil output to rise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The rise in North Sea oil and gas output - a factor in falling oil prices -
will be boosted this week when the East Brae field off Scotland comes on
stream.
The first oil should flow today or tomorrow, according to Marathon Oil,
operator of the field. Investment in the field totals Pounds 867m.
Output from the UK sector of the North Sea was 2.43m b/d in November,
compared with 2.13m b/d a year ago. Production will rise next year as new
fields approach peak flows.

FT  21 DEC 93 / OECD Annual Report: Trade rows need to be tackled -
Conclusion of Uruguay Round is only half the battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development yesterday urged
governments to use the momentum for trade liberalisation created by last
week's Uruguay Round agreement to tackle other trade disputes and
difficulties.
Mr Kumiharu Shigehara, the OECD's chief economist, said the successful
conclusion of the Uruguay Round did not mean that all trade problems were
solved.
The final agreement either did not cover or only partially covered a number
of long-standing problems, he said. New issues such as the interaction
between trade and measures to protect the environment had emerged since the
start of the round and were creating friction.
Fresh threats to the multilateral trading system had also emerged during the
recession in the industrialised world and there had been a perceptible drift
towards managed trade measures, he said.
Although he did not name the US, which has sought numerical goals for
reducing Japan's trade surplus, Mr Shigehara criticised moves towards
bilateral 'results-oriented' approaches to trade aimed at guaranteeing
market shares or setting specific changes in bilateral trade balances.
Another problem was the emergence of an environment in which vested
interests were protected at the expense of the consumer and which ultimately
damaged the industries that were being protected by taking from them the
incentive to innovate.
Mr Shigehara said governments - and in particular the 24 industrialised
member states of the OECD - should resist these wider threats to the global
trading system by building on the Uruguay Round agreement.
The round could start having a positive psychological impact on the global
economy next year. However, it still had to be ratified so that its
beneficial effects would be felt only gradually.
The OECD has estimated that the trade liberalisation measures agreed in the
round could boost world welfare by Dollars 270bn (Pounds 181bn) at current
prices by 2002. Yesterday, Mr Shigehara said that this figure, which would
be equivalent to about 1 per cent of likely global income, was 'probably an
underestimate'.

FT  21 DEC 93 / OECD Annual Report: Yen's rise means slow recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The steep appreciation of the yen since mid-1992 is a shock which will have
far-reaching effects on the Japanese economy and elsewhere for many years,
the OECD report says.
The yen's effective appreciation of nearly 30 per cent since the first half
of last year, coming on top of over-investment and asset price inflation,
means any recovery in Japanese economic activity is expected to be slow
'with 1994 likely to register, at best, very weak growth'.
In the longer term, the OECD believes the yen's rise could reduce the level
of Japan's current account surplus by nearly Dollars 60bn or 1.5 per cent of
gross domestic product in 1997. The OECD says the US current account could
benefit to the tune of Dollars 18bn a year by 1997 from Japan's loss of
competitiveness and market share, while the current account position of the
four largest European economies could improve by Dollars 24bn altogether.
The OECD says the yen's rise is likely to hit production in Japan next year
so that output by late 1995 could be 2 per cent lower than it would have
been with an unchanged exchange rate. Competitive pressures on wages and
profit margins could lower domestic prices by 5 per cent during this period.
The OECD expects a 0.7 per cent drop in Japan's merchandise export volumes
next year. It reports that many businesses are finding it unattractive to
supply customers with products made in Japan.

FT  21 DEC 93 / OECD Annual Report: OECD jobless total may hit 35m in 1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As many as 35m people could be jobless in the industrialised world next year
and the modest growth in prospect holds out little hope of a rapid fall in
unemployment, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
reports in the latest half-yearly Economic Outlook.
The Paris-based body, which is owned by governments to promote international
economic co-operation, says an increasingly solid expansion is under way in
North America while moderate, if unspectacular, recoveries are continuing in
the UK, Australia, New Zealand and some smaller European countries. Activity
in member countries should also be supported by strong growth outside the
OECD, especially in Asia.
But in continental Europe, the recovery that was expected last spring is
'not yet apparent', while economic activity in Japan has renewed its
decline.
The OECD expects gross domestic product of the industrialised countries will
grow by 2.1 per cent next year after only 1.1 per cent in 1993 and will
accelerate to 2.7 per cent in 1995. It is a measure of the frustrations and
exaggerated hopes of the past two years that its forecasts for the period
immediately ahead are roughly the same as those in its Outlook of December
1991.
One bright spot is the fall in inflation to 4 per cent or less in 20 of the
organisation's member states. This trend is forecast to continue with
inflation in the area, excluding Turkey, expected to fall to 2 1/4 per cent
by 1995. This, if sustained, 'will help to establish an economic environment
more conducive to sustainable increases in productive investment, output and
employment than has existed since the early 1960s.'
In the short term, however, the employment outlook is bleak, especially on
the European continent. The OECD expects the European jobless rate will rise
to 11.5 per cent in 1995, when more than 22m will be out of work, from 8.6
per cent in 1991, when 16.5m Europeans were unemployed.
The marked economic variations among the OECD's 24 member states require
significantly different policy responses. However, the organisation urges
all countries to press on with structural reform to make economies more
efficient. In particular, it urges the increased use of market mechanisms to
improve quality of public spending.
Otherwise, it sees little scope for fiscal policy to support activity
because most countries are having to deal with excessive budget deficits.
In Europe, for example, there is 'virtually no room for any fiscal
stimulus'. Indeed, some heavily indebted countries including Italy, Belgium
and Greece, should do more to cut their budget deficits.
It recommends caution even in Japan, which is perhaps the only big member
country able to contemplate a fiscal boost. Tax cuts should be temporary and
designed to achieve other desirable goals. For example, a cut in Japan's
direct taxes now could be offset later by a phased introduction of higher
indirect taxes which would improve government revenues.
The gathering US recovery suggests 'this is the one major country where
additional support to activity is not an immediate concern'. Instead, the
OECD reminds Washington that more action will be needed to reduce its
structural budget deficit.
It hints strongly that the Federal Reserve will have to tighten monetary
policy soon to lock in low inflation and projects a steady rise in US
three-month interest rates to 4.7 per cent in the second half of next year
and 5.1 per cent in late 1995, from 3 per cent at present.
Interest rates will be crucial to developments in Europe. The OECD argues
that falling rates have underpinned recovery in the English-speaking
countries and prescribes the same medicine for the European continent but
not for the UK.
Yesterday Mr Kumiharu Shigehara, the OECD's chief economist, said that
monetary easing must play the central role in supporting economic recovery
on the European continent. 'At this stage, prospects for a decline in German
inflation appear favourable, and any room for easing monetary conditions
further without undermining the credibility of policy should be used fully,'
he said.
However the OECD outlook recognises that problems could arise if German
inflation remains high. To cope with this, other European countries should
take steps to bolster their own counter-inflation credibility, possibly by
setting inflation targets or giving their central banks greater
independence.

FT  21 DEC 93 / OECD Annual Report: UK expected to see growth of 2.9% next
year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent UK budget will have a negative impact on demand in the short term
and could reduce Britain's growth rate by about a quarter of a percentage
point both in 1994 and in 1995, the OECD believes.
Mr Kumiharu Shigehara, the OECD's chief economist, said that the tax
increases and spending cuts were nonetheless a welcome move towards cutting
the UK's budget defi-cit.
The recent fall in interest rates would partly offset the negative effects
on growth of the fiscal tightening, he said. On the basis of a tentative
assessment, the OECD believes that the budget measures announced by Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will have no adverse effect on inflation.
In its economic outlook, published yesterday, the OECD says that recovery in
Britain is 'well under way' and forecasts sustained modest economic growth
with low inflation for the next two years.
The outlook, which was completed before the November 30 budget, forecasts
that UK economic growth will quicken to 2.9 per cent next year and in 1995
from 2 per cent this year while unemployment should fall slowly to 9.5 per
cent in 1995 from 10 per cent at present.
It says Britain's short-run inflation outlook is benign, largely because of
the legacy of the longest post-war recession. However, underlying inflation,
as measured by the retail prices index minus mortgage interest payments, may
remain above the mid-point of the government's 1-4 per cent target range.
The organisation says the effects of the substantial easing of monetary
policy since sterling's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism have
yet to be fully felt. Because UK interest rates have fallen sharply since
September 1992, the OECD expects little change in UK short-term rates in the
next two years.
It projects that they will average 5.5 per cent next year after 6 per cent
in 1993, before rising slightly to 5.7 per cent in 1995.
The OECD believes there is still considerable slack in the UK economy.
It estimates that the output gap - measuring the difference between real
gross domestic product and its potential - was 5.5 per cent last year,
second to Canada's 5.9 per cent in the Group of Seven leading industrial
countries and well above the US and German output gaps of 0.7 per cent and
0.6 per cent respectively.

FT  21 DEC 93 / N Sea oil output boosted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The steady rise in North Sea oil and gas production - which has been a big
factor behind falling international oil prices - will be boosted this week
when the East Brae field off Scotland comes on-stream.
The first oil should flow today or tomorrow, according to Marathon Oil,
operator of the field. East Brae has a capacity of 100,000 barrels a day,
although the initial production rate will be about 20,000 b/d. Investment in
the field totals Pounds 867m.
Output from the UK sector of the North Sea rose to 2.43m b/d in November,
compared with 2.13m b/d a year earlier. Production will rise even further
next year as new fields approach their peak production rates.
The prospects for further gas finds in Liverpool Bay received a boost
yesterday when Hamilton Oil, Lasmo and Monument Resources reported that an
exploratory well had struck gas in a block 3km (1.8 miles) from the Hamilton
gas field. Another well is expected to be drilled in the area.
The developers of the Liverpool Bay project, which received approval from
the government last month, have been confident of finding a number of
smaller oil and gas accumulations near the main fields.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Clinton plea over Libyan dissident
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton has issued a personal appeal to President Hosni
Mubarak of Egypt on behalf of Mr Mansour Kikhia, a former Libyan foreign
minister and prominent opponent of Colonel Muammer Gadaffi's regime who
disappeared mysteriously in Cairo 10 days ago.
US officials said yesterday they were 'very concerned' about the fate of Mr
Kikhia, who Libyan opposition groups claim was abducted by Libyan agents
soon after arriving in Cairo to attend a human rights meeting. His
disappearance coincided with a call by Libya's 'basic popular committees' in
Tripoli to 'crush traitors and spies' and followed a speech in November by
Col Gadaffi during which he said opponents of his regime who had 'escaped to
America' deserved 'slaughter'. Mr Kikhia, who came to Cairo from his home in
the US, heads an umbrella group of four anti-Gadaffi opposition factions.
Mr Kikhia's disappearance is a profound embarrassment to the Egyptian
government, which says it is doing everything to discover his whereabouts.
Yesterday, Mr Osama el-Baz, Mr Mubarak's senior political adviser, travelled
unexpectedly to Tripoli, apparently to discuss the missing former minister.
According to Mr Henry Schuler, Libya specialist at the Washington-based
Centre for Strategic and International Studies who says he is a close friend
of Mr Kikhia, the former Libyan minister was given personal assurances from
senior Egyptians for his security in Cairo before leaving for Egypt.
Mr Kikhia's case, which was also raised last week by Mr Boutros Boutros
Ghali, the United Nations secretary general, in a message to the Egyptian
authorities, has raised serious concern among western governments that Col
Gadaffi may have abandoned any attempts to curry favour in the west and is
intent instead on reviving his self-appointed role as a maverick and
dangerous nuisance. 'If it is proven that Mr Kikhia has been abducted, it
would be a very serious change in policy,' said one western diplomat.
Col Gadaffi has raised his anti-western rhetoric considerably since the UN
voted to toughen sanctions against Libya on December 1 for its continued
refusal to hand over two agents suspected of planting the bomb which
destroyed PanAm 103 over Lockerbie five years ago this week.
Libyan television on Sunday broadcast speeches by Col Gadaffi in which he
said he would 'feed the fish of the Mediterranean on the white flesh of
Britons, Americans and Frenchmen'. He also said: 'We have waved the olive
branch for two years, we have accepted mediation, we have told them (the
west) that we want peace, but these arrogant people have replied by
reinforcing sanctions.'
Earlier this month, Col Gadaffi also invited radical groups, including
members of the Irish Republican Army, and Palestinian groups associated with
bombings and hijackings, to Tripoli, in outright defiance of UN resolutions
ordering the Libyan regime to renounce any links with international
terrorism.
Intense US interest in Mr Kikhia's case stems in part from concern over this
apparent shift of policy. However, it also derives from the fact that he
holds a US work permit, runs a business in Missouri and has an American
wife, who wrote to President Clinton immediately after his disappearance.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Indian government is preparing to announce early next year the terms
under which private companies can enter the country's under-developed
telecommunications sector.
Mr N Vittal, chairman of the government's telecommunications commission,
said yesterday he hoped ministers would decide on the new policy by the end
of January.
The rules will bring together legal, technical and financial conditions
under which private groups, including foreign companies, would compete with
the monopoly state telecommunications network.
Northern Telecom of Canada and Qualcomm, US West and Media Digital, all of
the US, are among companies which have submitted operating proposals.
Potential bidders also include Indian commercial groups such as
Calcutta-based RP Goenka and Delhi-based YK Modi.
The most advanced project is a Dollars 100m (Pounds 67m) scheme submitted by
US West for the industrial town of Tirapur and its surrounding rural
district in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. The company would install a
wireless-based system temporarily before laying fibre optic cables. The
proposal has been cleared by the government's foreign investment promotion
board but is waiting for approval under the terms of the new rules.
Other schemes include Northern Telecom's offer to operate basic telephone
services in the northern state of Himachal Pradesh, and a plan from Southern
Wireless Communications, a venture supported by Comsat, the international
satellite communi-cations operator, to run telecommunications in the
southern state of Kerala.
Mr Vittal told journalists he hoped to increase the number of telephone
lines in India from 7m to 20m in the next two to three years.
The chairman, who has been criticised by trade unions for his privatisation
plans, said he had given workers assurances that neither their jobs nor
promotion prospects would be harmed. The planned expansion of services would
secure jobs, and workers would be retrained.
Reuter adds: At least 15 Indian soldiers and one attacker were killed
yesterday when suspected separatists of the National Socialist Council of
Nagaland ambushed an army convoy in the northeastern state of Nagaland,
United News of India (UNI) said.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Paris to host Mideast talks
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation were set to resume talks in
Paris today in an effort to break the deadlock over implementation of their
peace accord. The meeting, announced yesterday by Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO
chairman, comes after the apparent failure of talks in Norway at the
weekend.
An Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman said he could not confirm that talks
would take place in Paris but Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister, said on
Israel television that the two teams would meet again shortly. He said this
showed that 'both sides believe we can bridge the differences'.
Israeli officials said there was still dispute over who should control the
borders of the Gaza-Jericho area, which will fall under Palestinian
self-rule once Israeli troops complete a withdrawal. The officials said the
Palestinians had presented a proposal for Palestinian control of the borders
but with an international presence to stop arms cross-ing into Gaza-Jericho
and with Israel exercising remote-controlled electronic supervision.
Israel rejected the proposal and stood behind its refusal to concede control
over the borders, which it sees as a matter of external security left
exclusively to Israel under the peace agreement. Israel says it will allow a
Palestinian presence at the borders but will not relinquish its veto over
the right of entry into the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
On the second sticking point - the size of the Jericho area - officials said
there had been some progress and the Palestinians had scaled down demands;
requesting an area of 200 sq km after an earlier call for 345 sq km. Israel
has so far offered 27 sq km.
However, Mr Jan Egeland, Norwegian deputy foreign minister who hosted the
Norway talks, said both sides had made progress and had won compromise
proposals.
In Jerusalem Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said the Norway talks had
been neither a failure nor a success and said his summit meeting with Mr
Arafat, scheduled for this week, would be delayed unless firm progress was
made between the two sides.
In Oslo yesterday, Palestinian economic officials met the World Bank and
international donors to raise funds for a Palestinian police force.
Palestinian officials said the World Bank had estimated Dollars 96m (Pounds
64.4m) would be needed to fund a 15,000-strong police force for the first
year.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Good news of world's health
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The progress made in eradicating common childhood diseases across the world
is one of the greatest untold 'good news' stories this year, the United
Nations Children's Fund said yesterday in its annual State of the World's
Children report.
The report, which will be unveiled by US President Bill Clinton today, says
that concerted international effort has raised the level of basic child
immunisation coverage to almost 80 per cent across the world, up from 5 per
cent 25 years ago.
But in spite of the deliberately upbeat message, which comes after a year in
which UN agencies have faced growing criticism of their effectiveness and
management, the report insists that some Dollars 25bn (Pounds 16.7bn) a year
will be needed to tackle the broader problems of child poverty.
The area of greatest progress has been against childhood diseases. In spite
of a fall in immunisation levels this year, the report stresses that:
the number of children dying from measles has been cut from 2.5m a year in
the early 1980s to 1m this year;
the number crippled by polio has fallen to 140,000 a year, from 500,000 in
1980;
deaths from diarrhoeal diseases has fallen by more than a million, to below
3m;
family planning schemes have contributed to a cut in the average number of
births, down to 3.7 per woman from 6 per woman one generation ago.
On the gloomier side, though, children have now become one of the chief
victims of war, not only in high-profile regions such as Bosnia, but also in
lesser known wars in Africa - in the last decade alone 1.5m children have
been killed in armed conflicts, with a further 4m maimed or injured, Unicef
estimates.
One million children have become victims of Aids, which is now overtaking
measles as the main killer of children in several African countries.
Meanwhile, the spiral of poverty, population growth and environmental
degradation is threatening most of the Third World, the report says, with
Africa still sliding backwards into poverty.
Unicef denies the decision to focus on positive progress represented any
deliberate attempt to deflect criticism, and points out that, unlike that of
other UN agencies, Unicef's Dollars 938m budget does not come directly from
the UN but from donor governments - a situation many aid workers believe
leaves Unicef more sensitive and accountable than many other UN agencies.
But coming after a year of fierce debate about the role of multinational aid
groups and their relationship with the state and non-governmental sector,
Unicef has faced criticism of its own level of bureaucracy and the
sustainability of some of its programmes.
Save the Children fund, a non-governmental organisation whose director
recently called for a re-evaluation of the mandate of UN agencies, yesterday
said it welcomed Unicef's attempt to counter negative media images of the
Third World.
But it pointed out that since most progress against childhood diseases had
been achieved through outside funding, fears remain about the sustainability
of these projects. Although the World Bank calculates that Dollars 12 a head
is needed each year in developing countries to achieve basic health care,
most countries are only spending around Dollars 1.50 a head, leaving them
dangerously dependent on the plans of outside aid agencies, Save the
Children said.

for loan fund
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The International Monetary Fund is to press ahead with its new subsidised
loan fund to help the world's poorest countries restructure their economies,
even though it has failed to win cash pledges from the US and Germany.
The IMF board has decided to set up the new fund, a successor to its
enhanced structural adjustment facility, and hopes to start lending from it
by the end of February.
IMF officials have been looking for SDR5bn (Pounds 4.71bn) for the new
ESAF's capital account, on which contributors receive interest, and a
separate account of SDR2.1bn to subsidise the interest rates it charges to
borrowers down to the minimal level of 0.5 per cent.
Some of the money for the subsidy account is to come from the IMF's surplus
funds, but the Washington-based institution has been looking for about
SDR1.5bn of donations from richer countries.
Mr Jack Boorman, director of the IMF's policy development and review
department, said pledges had been received from 37 countries to cover 83 per
cent of the amount needed for the subsidy account.
Other Washington officials said, however, that some of these pledges were at
least implicitly conditional on Bonn and Washington taking a fair share of
the burden. Like other countries, Germany and the US face sharp constraints
on overseas aid budgets.
Germany, in particular, believes it has borne more than its share of the
burden of helping eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
In addition, financial officials in Washington say the developing countries
which receive ESAF loans need to make it clearer to donor governments how
much they need the facility. They have often been their own worst enemies by
lobbying more strongly for bilateral aid, which may have fewer strings
attached to it than ESAF loans.

<TEXT>
Australia and the US have reached agreement on a new three-year aviation
pact, which will give two airlines from each country equal access to the
valuable North Pacific route, from the US via Asia to Australia. The deal
follows a vicious and protracted aviation dispute between the two countries
earlier this year.
Under the agreement, which is effective immediately and will last for at
least three years, each country will be able to designate two carriers to
serve the route. Each of these four carriers will then be offered a start-up
capacity of three frequencies per week.
Any growth in capacity on the route after this will only take place if the
carriers in aggregate achieve a 70 per cent passenger load factor, and if at
least 55 per cent of their passengers represent 'through-traffic' from the
US to Australia. Australia will also receive a number of new route rights,
including Mexico, as a new 'beyond and intermediate point' on the South
Pacific route, and some additional points in the US on the North Pacific
route.
At present, Minnesota-based Northwest Airlines is the only US or Australian
carrier operating on the North Pacific route, three times a week. Chicago's
United Airlines has long sought to fly daily from New York to Sydney via
Tokyo, but has encountered problems with both the Australian and Japanese
authorities.
Australian carriers, meanwhile, have been hampered by the former restriction
which guaranteed US airlines unilateral access to the first eight
frequencies on the route each week.
Now it seems likely that Qantas - the country's long-established
international airline - will be one of its designated carriers. Ansett,
primarily a domestic airline but now pushing into the international arena,
could be a second.
The new agreement follows a bitter dispute this year, when Australia claimed
Northwest Airlines, the US carrier, had breached a '50 per cent cent' rule,
unilaterally imposed by Australia, on North Pacific flights.
Under this condition, Northwest faced a 50 per cent limit on the passengers
which it could carry on the Japan-Australia portion of its
Sydney-Osaka-Detroit flights.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Beirut bomb attack on Phalange leaders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two people were killed and 130 injured by a bomb at the headquarters of
Lebanon's right-wing Christian Phalange party in east Beirut last night.
Mr George Shahin, a spokesman for the party, said most of the casualties
occurred in the main meeting hall, where committee members were holding
their weekly session with Mr Salah Matar, a party leader.
Mr George Saadeh, head of the Phalange, was not at the meeting, according to
Voice of Lebanon radio.
The attack was the worst case of domestic political violence in Lebanon for
more than two years and came as the government was having some success in
restructuring the economy and attracting redevelopment funds.
The previously dominant role of Lebanon's Christian Maronite community has
been eroded by 17 years of civil war, an internal power struggle, and by the
1989 Taif agreement providing for more equitable power-sharing among the
country's communities.
The decision by many Maronites to boycott last year's general elections, in
protest at the Taif agreement and continuing Syrian influence in Lebanon,
was widely considered to have backfired. It left the Christian community
embittered and inadequately represented at official level.
While some Maronites argue for a total break from the central government,
others believe it is necessary to come to terms with Mr Rafiq al-Hariri, the
prime minister, and even to acknowledge that it is impossible in the short
term to force a Syrian troop withdrawal.

Taiwan announced yesterday that it would lift all restrictions on
repatriation of investment earnings by foreigners and raise the limits on
foreign investment in the securities, banking and insurance sectors.
Mr Chang Chang-pang, deputy finance minister, said the moves 'would bring
our financial services rules closer to the spirit of the Gatt Uruguay Round'
and would promote Taiwan's efforts to become a regional financial centre.
Until now, foreign investors have only been allowed to invest up to Dollars
100m at a time and must wait three months to repatriate income or capital.
Mr Samuel Shieh, governor of the Central Bank of China (Taiwan's central
bank), said it was 'still not appropriate' to lift the ban on individual
foreign investors owning more than 5 per cent of the stock of a listed
Taiwan company.

Mr Paul Keating, Australian prime minister, said yesterday Australia's
federal parliament would continue to sit for as long as necessary to debate
the highly-contentious 'native title' bill, which sets up a system for
dealing with land claims by aborigines and Torres Strait islanders.
The Australian parliament was meant to rise last week but recovened
yesterday in an effort to debate the legislation and deal with over 200
proposed amendments before Christmas.
Opposition leaders and interest groups such as the mining industry, which
are fighting the legislation, have urged either that it be scrapped or that
the matter at least be reconsidered in the new year.
Mr Keating said yesterday that 'If we have to sit here until Christmas Eve
and come back on Boxing Day and keep going, we will, because we're going to
see the senate vote on this bill'.
He added that the government was justified in seeking to have the bill
passed this year, in the light of the extensive consultation process that
had already taken place.

'The macro-economic control policy has made encouraging achievements but we

'There has not been a basic change in the fact that fixed-asset investment
has remained high and money supply growth has remained large. The pressure
of inflation still exists.'
However, Mr Zhu's remarks underlined his determination to press ahead with
economic reform while attempting to cool growth, which is expected to be 13
per cent in 1993, for the second successive year.
His attempts since July to reassert macro-economic control by restricting
bank credit and financial speculation have made him vulnerable to attack,
particularly from powerful Communist party officials in the provinces and
state-owned industry.
Mr Zhu, who is also governor of the central bank, insisted recently that his
measures remained on track, denying he had been forced to abandon them and
loosen control of money supply.
He stressed yesterday that control of inflation remained a priority.
'Stabilising the grain price and inflation. . . are key to a smooth
implementation of next year's reforms,' he said.
Grain prices have been of particular concern as inflation in big cities
reached 21.9 per cent in November. Mr Zhu said the large increase in the
price of grain at the end of November was 'abnormal, transient and caused by
psychological factors'. China was enjoying a bumper harvest and stockpiles
were at record levels.
He said the state would sell some of its grain stocks to force prices down.
He added that peasants, hearing government promises that the purchase price
of grain would rise next year, had held on to stocks and officials did not
understand how the market system should work.

Mr John Elliott, the Melbourne-based businessman and former head of the
Elders IXL brewing and agribusiness group, will not know until tomorrow at
the earliest, if he is to be charged in connection with ADollars 66.5m
(Pounds 30.2m)-worth of allegedly illegal foreign exchange dealings.
Mr Elliott is seeking special leave to appeal against the lifting of
injunctions which, for several months, have barred the authorities from
charging him and four other individuals over the alleged theft. The
application for leave to appeal was dismissed by a full Federal Court last
week and moved on to the High Court yesterday.
However, after a day of submissions, Justice Gaudron said she would give a
written judgment tomorrow or Thursday.

FT  21 DEC 93 / S African right seeks eleventh hour deal
</HEADLINE>

   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa's right-wing Freedom Alliance was in eleventh-hour talks last
night with the government and the African National Congress aimed at
securing the alliance's agreement to the post-apartheid constitution before
parliament votes it into law tomorrow.
Attempts were being made to agree constitutional changes accommodating the
demands of the right wing, which includes the Inkatha Freedom party and
white groups, for greater fiscal and legislative powers for regional
governments, including amendments which would leave room for an Afrikaner
homeland.
The ANC and the Afrikaner Volksfront announced yesterday they would today
sign an agreement in principle endorsing the idea of such a homeland.
However, this represents only a tentative first step towards a 'volkstaat',
which is likely to have only limited autonomy.
Nevertheless, the agreement appears to have prompted divisions among
right-wing Afrikaners: between moderates, represented by General Constand
Viljoen and his Afrikaner Volksfront, and Conservative party radicals, led
by Mr Ferdi Hartzenberg.
It is believed that Mr Hartzenberg will not sign the accord, although some
more moderate Conservative party MPs will attend the ceremony in support of
it. The agreement will be signed by Gen Viljoen and Mr Jacob Zuma for the
ANC.
The absence of Mr Hartzenberg from the ceremony highlights a potential split
between the right, and the risk that the ANC might be unable to persuade the
radicals - including the paramilitary Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging
(Afrikaner Resistance Movement) - to accept a constitutional settlement and
participate in next year's all-race elections.
The ANC has been treading a difficult path, trying to draw in the far right
without conceding too much autonomy to any future Afrikaner homeland and
alienating its own supporters.
The Freedom Alliance, government and ANC, meeting together for the first
time, have until 8am today to secure agreement before a final draft of the
constitution is printed for a parliamentary vote.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Despite failing to clinch the city of Potsdam in the run-off in
Brandenburg's local government elections, the Party of Democratic Socialism,
successors to the East German Communist party, have made their point. The
established parties are worried.
They have reason. Of the 85 mayoral councils in the cities and towns, 30
will be headed by the PDS. That corresponds roughly to their total share of
the vote. The PDS gained 21.2 per cent, 13 points behind the Social
Democrats who govern the state of Brandenburg, and one point ahead of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats. Mr Rolf Kutzmutz, the
self-declared informer for the Stasi secret police in the ancien regime who
last Sunday lost Potsdam to Mr Horst Gramlich, the SPD's incumbent, was
victorious in defeat. 'The PDS has sent a signal. From now on it will be
very difficult to exclude the PDS from decision-making,' he said.
Now that it has managed to bounce back in Brandenburg after unification, the
question is whether the PDS can convert local gains to state and federal
gains in next year's elections. It will be difficult. The PDS's real power
bases in eastern Germany are in Brandenburg and east Berlin. It could well
concentrate its energy in those two regions to secure representation in the
Bundestag, or lower house.
Its progress in forthcoming elections will also depend on what kind of
campaign the established parties run. The Christian Social Union, the
Bavarian-based sister party of the CDU, has already argued that the PDS is a
worse threat than the far right. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, said
at the weekend the PDS posed a threat to democracy.
Yet recent statistics on the membership structure for some of the PDS party
organisations - and the far right - clearly show that it is hardline former
Communist party members who are seeking refuge in the far right, rather than
among the ranks of the PDS.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Narrow win likely for Serb Socialists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER and MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The ruling Socialist party of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic yesterday
claimed victory in parliamentary elections although final results are not
expected until tomorrow. Their claimed victory is wafer-thin and the last
votes could still determine whether Mr Milosevic will keep his grip on power
and his ability to sideline the divided opposition.
Based on the party's count of 55 per cent of the vote, the Socialists said
they would win between 124 and 128 of the 250 seats in parliament, enabling
Mr Milosevic to form another Socialist government. 'The Socialist party of
Serbia has achieved an overwhelming victory,' claimed Mr Ivica Dacic, the
party spokesman. 'We will have either an absolute or relative majority.'
But opposition leaders immediately denied these claims, based on their own
count of Sunday's ballot. Mr Zoran Djindjic, head of the centrist Democratic
party, said: 'It seems impossible for them to get an absolute majority. No
party will be able to form a government alone.'
According to partial results, the Democrats and the biggest opposition bloc,
Depos, headed by Mr Vuk Draskovic, were set to win about one-third of the
seats in the Serbian assembly. The opposition has failed to join forces, but
political leaders privately indicated that they could now unite.
Their scope for manoeuvre has been raised by the relatively strong
performance of Mr Vojislav Seselj, an ultra-nationalist MP and former ally
of Mr Milosevic, despite a smear campaign waged against him.
Mr Milosevic called early elections in October when Mr Seselj threatened to
bring down the Socialist government. But the ballot seems to have
rehabilitated him as an opposition figure and indicated popular support for
his attacks on corruption in official circles. His targets included Mr
Milosevic and Mr Zeljko Raznatovic, known as Arkan, a Belgrade Mafia boss
turned paramilitary commander whose name, like that of Mr Seselj, appears on
US lists of suspected war criminals.
Voters were not enticed by Arkan's nationalistic campaign. But the low vote
for this symbol of Serbian paramilitary violence does not signal a rejection
of the idea of Greater Serbia. All candidates, including the democratic
opposition, expressed similar views on the national question. The Socialists
were attacked for profiting from the economic chaos, induced partly by UN
sanctions, after nearly three years of war. But opposition leaders remained
silent on the violent partition of Bosnia which led to the imposition of UN
sanctions.
If Mr Milosevic fails to win an absolute majority his image as the
invincible leader of all Serbs would suffer. This would force him to devote
his attention to an increasingly unstable Serbia rather than on expanding
its borders.
The UN General Assembly last night appealed to the Security Council to lift
the arms embargo against Bosnia, a step long proposed by the US, writes
Michael Littlejohns in New York. The resolution - a recommendation which the
Council is free to ignore - was adopted as Bosnia agreed to drop charges
that Britain, by supporting the embargo, violated the Genocide Convention.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Antall successor brings firm hand to Hungary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Boross, Hungary's acting premier since the illness and death of Mr
Jozsef Antall, goes before parliament in Budapest today to be confirmed as
the country's new prime minister.
The smoothness of the succession has defied the doom-mongering speculation
typical of Hungary. Commentators pondered every potential catastrophe from
wrenching leadership struggle to constitutional crisis, from swing to the
right to state of emergency, early elections to delayed elections.
Instead, the governing conservative Hungarian Democratic Forum took just a
day after Mr Antall's death to designate Mr Boross, the interior minister,
as successor. Although the conservative coalition's majority is formally
just in single figures, parliamentary approval for Mr Boross today appears
assured. Eastern Europe's longest-serving government is still well placed to
complete a full term in office.
Hungary has passed the initial test. But Mr Antall personified Hungary's
political stability and so the question arises of how much will survive him.
Mr Boross, aged 65 and a former catering company executive, has never been
elected and only joined the Forum in 1991. He may therefore feel the need to
secure his political base by appealing to the Forum's right-wing activists.
He is an altogether rawer politician than his predecessor and his
confrontational rhetoric has made him a bogeyman for opposition liberals and
socialists. Even one of his former colleagues admits: 'Boross scares
people.'
Critics point to Mr Boross's call for a strong centralised state to ensure
governability and strong armed forces to maintain the security of Hungary
and the 3.5m ethnic Hungarians across the borders.
The conservatism of Mr Boross is of the uncompromising variety. When Amnesty
International issued a critical report on human rights in Hungary, the then
interior minister labelled the authors 'over-sensitive liberal
philanthropists that you find in every country'.
So much for words. As for actions, opposition politicians note a
coincidence, although they cannot prove it was any more than that. While Mr
Boross was acting prime minister when Mr Antall was in Germany receiving
treatment in October and November, the Evening Balance TV news, a sharp
cabaret radio show and other allegedly 'disloyal' programmes were suspended.
Mr Boross is no extremist, however. He rose in politics through Mr Antall's
sponsorship and so is unlikely to diverge too far from his predecessor's
path. The Forum chose him precisely because he offered competent leadership
and continuity.
The bigger question is whether Mr Boross will be able to revive the Forum's
electoral chances in the run-up to elections expected next May. The party is
running fourth in the opinion polls with around 10 per cent support while
the Smallholders party, a key partner in the conservative coalition, has
self-destructed.
Mr Boross's owlish face brings little to the Forum's televisual, and
electoral, appeal. But he, unlike his predecessor, has at least the physical
robustness to conduct a campaign, and his forceful and plain speaking could
prove an asset.
Personality, however, will prove less decisive than the economy, which has
contracted by 20 per cent since 1990 and brought approval for the government
down with it. The problem is that Mr Boross has little room to stimulate the
economy and so raise voters' sense of well-being.
At the central bank council meeting last week the National Bank of Hungary,
the newly independent central bank, held to the monetary tightening which
has seen money-market interest rates rise 5 per cent since July, compounding
government fears that tight monetary policy will snuff out economic recovery
next year.
Politically, prolonged economic stagnation plays into the hands of the
Hungarian Socialist party, the former communists.
After the recent shock over the Russian election results the Forum may be
able to win back moderate voters with a red scare and the party's record of
steady government. But even if the conservatives and the Forum fail, Mr
Antall will at least have the posthumous honour of being not only
post-communist Europe's longest serving head of government, but also one of
the few to have departed undefeated.

<TEXT>
Mr W. Edwards Deming, the American quality control expert who became one of
the most influential figures in modern industrial management, died yesterday
peacefully in his sleep at his Washington, DC, home. He was 93.
Mr Deming, one of several US quality control experts who taught in Japan
after the second world war, playing a crucial role in revolutionising
Japanese manufacturing tech- niques and helping the country gain a leading
global position in many industries. Although he was revered in Japan, his
ideas were largely ignored in his native US until the 1980s, when they
contributed to the so-called Total Quality Management (TQM) movement which
has helped improve American industrial efficiency.
Trained as a statistician, Deming helped develop a theory of how management
could gather statistics on subtle variations in manufacturing levels as a
way to improve the quality of a company's output, and then expanded this
into a theory of management that stressed worker involvement.
Leading US companies yesterday expressed sorrow. General Motors said: 'In
our view there is no single person in the world that has had a more profound
effect on quality processes than did Dr Deming'.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Row over Balladur success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The growing tension that Mr Edouard Balladur's rising popularity is causing
his rivals was highlighted yesterday after two ministers of the centre-right
UDF party triggered a political row by endorsing the Gaullist RPR prime
minister for president.
Mr Jean-Louis Debre, deputy secretary general of the RPR and a die-hard
backer of Mr Jacques Chirac for the Elysee, yesterday criticised Mr Francois
Leotard, the defence minister, and Mrs Simone Veil, the social affairs
minister, for 'missing a fine occasion to shut up' when in separate TV
interviews on Sunday they praised Mr Balladur's presidential potential.
Mr Debre said the ministerial pair 'would have done better to have followed
Mr Balladur's instructions not to speak now of the presidential election',
due in spring 1995. But Mr Balladur himself fuelled speculation about his
hopes by saying in an interview, published yesterday in Le Figaro newspaper,
that he could not envisage staying in the prime minister's Matignon
residence for a full parliamentary term.
'Five years in the Matignon, never. Two years, yes. After that, we will
see,' he told the newspaper.
But yesterday's row - which was also caused by the UDF's growing preference
for Mr Balladur over its nominal leader, Mr Giscard d'Estaing - raises the
question of whether Mr Balladur has not shown his hand too early.
The health of the 77-year-old President Mitterrand means a presidential poll
before May 1995 cannot be ruled out.

FT  21 DEC 93 / French franc surges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French franc yesterday strengthened on the money markets to reach
FFr3.409 against the D-Mark, its highest level since last summer's European
currency crisis.
Yesterday's gains, which were fuelled by the D-Mark's weakness and the
announcement of a healthy current account surplus for France in September,
marked a continuation of the franc's recent strong performance which has
taken it back above its old floor rate of FFr3.4305 to the D-Mark before the
extension of the European exchange rate mechanism trading bands.
The Paris stock market also benefited from the announcement by the Finance
Ministry of a FFr9bn (Pounds 1.02bn) current account surplus for September
and of a FFr56.53bn surplus for the first nine months of the year (against
FFr4.02bn for the same period of 1992). The CAC-40 Index rose by 1.23 per
cent during the day to close at 2,223.47.
Economists said that investors' sentiment towards France had improved in
recent weeks, reflecting cautious confidence in its recovery potential and
relief at the successful outcome of the Gatt negotiations. However, they
said the franc and French equities had also benefited from technical
adjustments as investors have tried to balance their investment positions
before the end of the year.
'The surge of interest in France is part of a general interest in European
investments,' said Mr Christopher Potts, chief French economist at Banque
Indosuez in Paris.
'But it's also fair to say that the franc has been helped by the gradual
realisation among investors that the Balladur government really is committed
to maintaining stability with the D-Mark.'
The mood of cautious confidence was reinforced by the publication of the
latest economic forecast from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development, which predicted a modest recovery for the French economy in
1994, with growth of 1.1 per cent in gross domestic product.
However, the OECD warned of a further increase in unemployment from its
present record of 12 per cent of the French workforce to 12.5 per cent
during 1994.
It does not expect to see the unemployment rate fall until 1995, when it
forecasts GDP growth of 2.7 per cent for France.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Madrid move upsets EU growth talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Spain yesterday threw already vexed European Union membership negotiations
with Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway into confusion by demanding that
they be left out of the Maastricht mechanisms for setting up a single
European currency by 1999.
Although the Spanish proposal won little support from EU foreign ministers
meeting in Brussels, it could hold up attempts to close the Maastricht
chapters of the entry negotiations when the 12 meet the four candidates
today.
The EU and the four are working against the clock to finish the accession
talks by March, for the enlargement to take place as planned on January 1
1995. New delays in areas which until now had been relatively
uncontroversial could make this already receding goal even more remote.
Spain says that on the earliest date, 1997, for the third phase of economic
and monetary union (Emu), only the 12 member states which negotiated the
Maastricht treaty should be taken into account.
Under Maastricht, a single currency would go ahead in 1997 only if a
majority of the 12 met the strict convergence criteria on debt, budget
deficits, inflation and interest rates. At present, only Luxembourg of the
12 meets these criteria.
But it is a theoretical possibility that a small 'hard core' grouped around
Germany and the Netherlands, added to Austria and the Nordic economies,
could constitute a majority among 15 or 16 member states. That, in the
Spanish view, would move the momentum of European integration decisively
northwards, a prospect Madrid rejects.
It is therefore insisting that the majority referred to in the Maastricht
treaty must come from among the original 12. New member states could join
Emu at the early date but would not constitute part of the required
majority. Spain also wants to prevent the generally better financial
performance of the four applicant countries from being factored in to the
Emu convergence criteria, thereby making it a harder goal for the existing
12.
After the near implosion of the EU's exchange rate mechanism in August, the
notion of a first try at Emu in 1997 is widely considered academic. Several
EU diplomats speculated yesterday that Spain was trying to keep the Emu
chapter of the accession talks open as a counterweight to later and more
difficult negotiations on Norwegian fisheries resources.
But the ploy could have a damaging ripple effect. The electorates in all
four applicants are already sensitised by vigorous 'No' lobbies about EU
decisions affecting them taken without their governments' participation.
Austria already wants a declaration in its accession treaty that its
currency will not be diminished by participating in the full Emu project.

EU foreign ministers agreed yesterday to withdraw tariff concessions on
imports from the Austrian subsidiaries of Grundig and General Motors in a
row over state subsidies.
The decision follows a series of complaints about state subsidies to
Austrian-based exporters, and could sour negotiations over Austrian
accession to the Union. The EU Commission recommended withdrawal of
favourable tariffs for two motor plants and a television factory in Austria
last July, claiming they had received Ecu80m (Pounds 61.2m) of illegal state
aid.
Brussels argues the companies are in direct competition with EU
manufacturers, and that the aid would not be accepted for similar projects
carried out in comparable areas of the Union.
The withdrawal of tariff concessions is likely to be equivalent to imposing
import duties of 14 per cent on Grundig television sets, manufactured near
Vienna. Diplomats said yesterday that 4.9 per cent duties would be levied on
cylinder heads and gearboxes made by General Motors Austria at Aspern.
However, a third Austrian company, Steyr, escaped duties on its heavy
vehicles following negotiation of a subsidy-cutting deal with Vienna.
The diplomats said Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands had voted against
imposition of the duties, while Greece had abstained.
The Commission claimed General Motors had received state aid amounting to 15
per cent of an Ecu324m investment in its Aspern plant, while Grundig had
received 10 per cent state aid to sweeten an Ecu72.5m investment in its TV
production line.

Britain and Italy yesterday proposed the development of possible security
links between the EU and east European countries to anchor them more closely
to the west in an unstable period, Reuter reports from Brussels.
The plan was presented to EU foreign ministers by Italian foreign minister
Beniamino Andreatta. Mr Willy Claes, foreign minister of Belgium, the EU
president, said: 'Particularly in the light of elections in Russia and
uncertainty in Ukraine, it is obvious that anxiety is growing in central
Europe and the Baltics, so we need to give a clear sign of our support to
these countries.'

FT  21 DEC 93 / Tokyo shares fall 3.6% amid coalition fears
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The surfacing of policy differences in Japan's seven-party coalition
government and rumours of a snap election were blamed for a 3.6 per cent dip
in Tokyo stock prices yesterday, the largest fall in the Nikkei average this
year.
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has delayed the compilation of the budget
for the next fiscal year, as the Social Democratic party, the largest group
in the coalition, opposed changes to the taxation system proposed by Mr
Hosokawa and other members of the coalition.
Confidence was also shaken by the absence yesterday of Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the
power broker behind the coalition. Mr Ozawa, who is said to be suffering
from influenza, has been in poor health in the past year and there were
fears that a prolonged illness would lead to the collapse of the coalition.
After an hour's trading today the Nikkei average was only slightly down on
last night's close of 17,404.24. Yesterday's fall came amid relatively thin
trading and followed weeks of jumpiness. This, in part, has reflected the
moods of the coalition partners, whose differences over political reform,
trade and taxation policy are becoming more obvious.
Mr Masayoshi Takemura, the chief cabinet secretary, said the government was
watching the stock market closely and regarded the Nikkei average as an
important indicator of the economy's health. He suggested that Mr Hosokawa
would announce fresh policies later this week in an attempt to stimulate
growth.
The government is considering a cut in income taxes, though Mr Hosokawa is
in favour of an increase in the country's 3 per cent value-added tax to
compensate for the reduction.
However, the SDP insists that it will oppose an increase from 3 per cent,
and could withdraw from the coalition over the issue.
It is feared that unless the government cuts income taxes, personal
consumption will fall sharply over the next couple of months.
The Ministry of Labour said yesterday that employees in large companies
received a 0.3 per cent cut in their winter bonuses this year, the first
fall since 1975.
The trimming of the winter bonus follows a 0.9 per cent decrease in the
summer bonus, the first fall in both payments since the ministry began
conducting its survey in 1965.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Gatt concessions spark disputes in UK and Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
High-level divisions exist within the UK and German governments over
last-minute concessions made to France last week to win final agreement for
the world trade deal.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, is understood to have
complained to Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, on the eve of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade deal about British support for
measures which will make it easier for the European Commission to retaliate
against unfair trading.
German reservations also surfaced at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in
Brussels yesterday. A senior Bonn government official complained that new
European trade defence mechanisms agreed last week could harm economic and
political reform in central and eastern Europe.
Although London and Bonn accept that the Gatt deal is done, the arguments
point to further trade tensions within the EU. They also suggest a degree of
dissent at the highest level with the direction of policy set out by Mr John
Major, the prime minister, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany.
The doubts underline the dilemma facing the German government as it balances
the interests of its closest western ally, France, with those of neighbours
to the east. But they also mirror divisions within the British cabinet. Mr
Clarke is understood to have wanted Mr Major to lobby Chancellor Kohl to
resist French demands because they risked compromising the principle of free
trade in the EU.
Mr Hurd declined to intervene on the grounds that Mr Kohl was likely to meet
most of France's demands, according to informed officials. He also said that
the commission would show restraint on trade retaliation because
responsibility lay primarily with Sir Leon Brittan, the senior UK
commissioner and a free-trader by instinct, the officials said.
The measures agreed by EU foreign ministers last Wednesday mean that the
commission can take action more easily against dumping and subsidised
exports.
In Brussels yesterday, Mrs Ursula Seiler-Albring, German minister of state
for foreign affairs, pressed for tougher wording in the minutes agreed last
Wednesday which removed the final European hurdle to the Gatt accord.
According to Belgian and German officials, she identified the agreement on
'safeguard' measures as the most troublesome.
The reason is that it overturned the long-standing principle that
retaliation could be blocked by a minority of free-trading countries led by
the UK and Germany and could harm the east Europeans, diplomats said.
The UK last week supported measures to allow the commission's preliminary
decisions to use anti-dumping or anti-subsidies to become definitive by a
simple majority vote.
France was widely seen as a big winner in last week's Gatt deal because it
won EU support for revisions in the 1991 Blair House agreement with the US
limiting subsidised food exports. It also resisted US demands for wider
access to Europe's television and broadcasting markets.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Ulster peace hopes set back by amnesty demand: Sinn Fein
call for release of prisoners angers Unionists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes of peace in Northern Ireland were jolted yesterday when Mr Gerry
Adams, the Sinn Fein president, called for all IRA prisoners to be released
from jail as part of a negotiated settlement.
His demand angered Protestant leaders. One Ulster Unionist MP immediately
warned that his party's 'tentative approval' of the Major-Reynolds peace
initiative could be withdrawn.
The row broke out after Downing Street again rejected an amnesty for IRA
prisoners. But officials acknowledged that all prisoners could have their
sentences reviewed under standard procedures which took account of their
likeliness to re-offend.
The dispute came as the IRA claimed responsibility for a bomb explosion
which injured a soldier and a civilian in west Belfast last night. It was
the first claim of responsibility since the Major-Reynolds declaration. The
IRA appears to be signalling there will be no extended Christmas ceasefire
before any decision to end violence. The attack followed the explosion of
two incendiary devices in London during the evening which police said bore
the hallmarks of the IRA.
However, Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, earlier said the fact
that the paramilitaries were considering the implications of the peace
process was 'very encouraging'. Speaking in Brussels, where EU foreign
ministers yesterday endorsed the Downing Street Declaration, Mr Spring
reiterated Dublin's view that 'the whole question of prisoners' would have
to be looked at if a permanent cessation of violence was achieved.
Seeking to exploit a suggestion by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime
minister, on Sunday that London might be ready to consider the future of
hundreds of IRA prisoners, Mr Adams said a negotiated settlement would
'remove the symptoms as well as the causes of the conflict.
'As part of this it is obvious that all prisoners must be released,' he
said.
In a strongly worded statement, the Sinn Fein president also criticised Mr
Reynolds' weekend warning that the IRA faced a tough security clampdown if
it did not respond positively to the peace initiative.
'The issuing of ultimatums by London and Dublin while we are considering
their document is most unhelpful,' he said.
Mr Ken Maginnis, the Ulster Unionist security spokesman, said he was 'not at
all impressed' by Mr Adams' statement and warned the two governments not to
'hand hostages to fortune' to the IRA.
He said: 'We thought the joint declaration . . . was a definitive statement
 -with all its shortcomings we accepted it on that basis. If we are going to
go beyond the joint declaration . . . then of course there will be a very
quick withdrawal of that tentative approval that has been given by the
majority of people in Northern Ireland.'
The government's response was welcomed by Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster
Unionist party leader, who said on BBC radio there could be no question of
an amnesty for convicted criminals. If the government reneged on that 'they
would be destroying the whole authority of the judicial system'.
The incendiary devices in central London were at a pub in Victoria, which
forced the evacuation of hundreds of passengers from the Victoria coach
station, and at the Royal Mail's Mount Pleasant sorting office, just north
of the City. Nobody was injured. A third device, found at a City sorting
office, was made safe.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Figures boost outlook for UK economic growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Prospects for steady economic expansion in the UK next year brightened
yesterday with news of a big improvement in company finances and an upward
revision of growth in the third quarter.
Hopes of a continuation in Britain's relatively strong economic performance
were also buoyed by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development, which said the UK would experience modest growth with low
inflation for the next two years.
Mr Kumiharu Shigehara, the OECD's chief economist, welcomed the UK
government's move in the November 30 Budget to reduce the large fiscal
deficit, even though he said the large tax rises and spending cuts due would
damp demand.
On the London stock market, shares rose to yet another record on
expectations that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, would cut interest
rates soon to offset the effects of the fiscal tightening.
The FT-SE 100 index of leading shares jumped 27.8 to close at 3,364.9, a
rise of nearly 8 per cent since the day before the Budget. In the 15 months
since Britain left the European exchange rate mechanism, the index has put
on almost 1,000 points.
In the third quarter, UK companies recorded a financial surplus of Pounds
1.726bn, the highest for seven years. This underlined efforts by business to
capitalise on firmer demand and lower interest rates to reduce borrowings
and strengthen balance sheets.
Optimism about growth prospects was nudged higher by other government
figures showing gross domestic product expanded 2.1 per cent in the third
quarter on a year earlier, stronger than the 1.9 per cent growth previously
thought.
Even though consumer spending in the third quarter was strong, total
sterling lending to the private sector was exceptionally weak in November,
with Bank of England figures showing the amount borrowed fell to Pounds 500m
from the previous month's Pounds 1.8bn. However, the City said the numbers
resulted from uncertainty before the Budget.
Much of the higher growth in the third quarter was due to upward revisions
by government statisticians to estimates of activity in service industries
such as retailing, hotels, catering and transport. Another pointer to the
better outlook for the UK was a large fall in the current account deficit in
the third quarter.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Mercury challenges Oftel over pricing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercury, the main competitor to British Telecommunications, is taking the
industry's watchdog to court in the first legal action to be pursued against
a regulator of the former state utilities.
Mercury claims that Oftel, the telecoms regulator, has not offered it
reasonable terms for the carriage of its traffic by BT, through a consistent
misinterpretation of BT's licence.
The legal challenge reflects Mercury's mounting frustration at the impact of
the current inter-connection regime on its ability to compete against BT.
Mercury, a long-distance carrier with about 10 per cent of the UK telecom
market, uses BT's network to deliver most of its calls to their final
destination. It pays BT on a per-minute basis, using BT's charge bands.
Mercury wants Oftel to introduce a radically different structure, based on
network capacity, which it claims would enable it to break free of BT's
tariff structure. Mr Mike Harris, Mercury's chief executive, said: 'We are
determined to use every means possible to break BT's dominance. On this
occasion, it means using the courts.'
Earlier this month, Oftel settled a long-running dispute between BT and
Mercury on interconnection terms, reducing the amount paid by Mercury.
Oftel refused to shift the basis of payment to capacity-based charging. It
is examining the future of the interconnection regime separately, and has
invited Mercury to submit detailed proposals. It claims Mercury has yet to
do so.
Mercury is not attempting to challenge Oftel's recent settlement. Instead it
is seeking a declaratory judgment from the High Court which, if successful,
will form the basis for its next inter-connection agreement with BT,
negotiations for which are expected to start next year.
Mr Don Cruickshank, Oftel director-general, told an FT conference earlier
this month that he wanted to move towards a pricing regime for
interconnection which left competitors unconstrained by BT's own tariff
structure. Mercury said yesterday it was not prepared to wait the 'few
years' it would take him to implement changes.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Gorillas win the Christmas toy battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US toymakers are this year showing renewed determination to test the
tolerance of the more politically aware.
Girls can expect to unwrap not only the usual Barbie dolls, furry animals
and miniature teasets. They may even dip into their Christmas stockings to
find a product called Mommy's Having A Baby - a doll which gives birth to a
4 1/2 inch offspring through a Velcro opening in a maternity dress.
'Rub Mommy's soft tummy and you can actually feel the baby,' says the toy
shop catalogue. 'See baby move . . . even decide when Mommy's ready to have
baby. With birth certificate, diaper, bottle and more.'
The manufacturer, Tyco Toys, says the Mommy doll addresses children's
natural curiosity about childbirth and pregnancy in a sensitive way. But
some women have pointed out that is not only politically, but anatomically,
incorrect; a female doctor in Massachusetts has said the doll might lead
children to believe all babies are born by Velcro caesarean.
Other ideologically suspect products this year include Electronic Dream
Phone, a game in which girls dial different numbers to find out which boys
have a crush on them. 'One of 24 incredible guys really likes you. Now you
just have to find out who by calling his friends for clues,' says the blurb.
Girls can progress to another game, Perfect Wedding, in which they plan for
the big event: 'The first to complete her plans and walk down the aisle
wins.'
For boys, the stereotyping seems to consist mainly of satisfying their
perceived appetite for violent confrontation with powerful assault weapons,
like this year's top-selling Nerf Arrowstorm - blasts six soft arrows over
30ft - or the Motorized Thunderstrike - the ultimate battery-operated air
blaster.
Video games are also growing more ghastly. In one, called Night Trap,
players try to prevent a gang of hooded zombies from capturing a group of
scantily clad sorority sisters: if they fail, the killers use a syringe to
suck the women's blood from their necks. It has proved so offensive many
retailers have removed it from their shelves.
On a brighter note, not all the toys on sale are violent or obviously
sexist. Mr Ian McDermott, senior buyer at FAO Schwartz, the Manhattan toy
store, says the best-selling toy is a Dollars 6 (Pounds 4) stuffed gorilla
eating a banana.
'I don't know why, but gorillas always sell well in any shape or form.
People find them amusing, especially if they're licking a banana,' he says.
And best of all, it is of indeterminate sex.

An incendiary device exploded in a pub in Victoria, central London, forcing
the evacuation of a coach station being used by hundreds of peak-hour

financial services and shipping had been excluded from the Uruguay Round
agreement on global trade liberalisation. In fact, both sectors are included
in the agreement. Further talks are continuing to settle outstanding

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Opposition militants protesting against Guinea's presidential election
stabbed a soldier to death in the capital Conakry yesterday, the Interior
Ministry said, Reuter reports from Conakry.
Journalists said at least three civilians had been killed in clashes between
supporters of the ruling party and the opposition, but ministry officials
were not immediately able to confirm the reports.
The opposition urged President Lansana Conte to postpone Guinea's first
multi-party election, but when its plea fell on deaf ears it vowed to do all
in its power to disrupt the poll, in which Gen Conte faces seven opponents.
Witnesses said polling stations in Conakry's Hafiya district were burned
down on Saturday night and those in Sangoya and Cig-Madina were attacked
yesterday morning.
State radio said voting was normal in the interior in the towns of Kindia,
Koya and Boke, but there was no immediate word from the mining town of
Kankan, a bastion of the Guinean People's Assembly (RPG), the oldest
opposition movement.
The centre of Conakry, a centre of support for Gen Conte's Party of Unity
and Progress (PUP), was calm.
Guinea has never had a real election since independence from France in 1958.
Until he died in 1984, Guinea was run as a one-party police state by
President Sekou Toure.
The Geneva-based International Commission of Jurists said last Wednesday it
had cancelled plans to monitor the election because it was not satisfied
with arrangements.
Vehicle traffic apart from essential services was barred in Conakry from
midnight but residents said troops were out in force at 6pm.
Gen Conte took over in a 1984 coup and only agreed to multi-party politics
under foreign and domestic pressure. Scores of people have died in violence
since May.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The mandate of Algeria's five-man presidency, which was due to step down at
the end of the year, has been extended to January 31, the official news
agency APS reported yesterday, Reuter writes from Algiers.
The presidency, which is called the High Council of State (HCE), has ruled
Algeria since the cancellation in January 1992 of a general election that
the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) party was poised to win.
The FIS was later banned.
APS also said a long-planned national conference, designed to chart
Algeria's path to democracy after a transitional period expected to last two
to three years, would be held on January 25 and 26.
Both announcements were made by the High Security Council, which is
Algeria's highest constitutional authority, after a meeting yesterday.
The conference is being organised by a National Dialogue Commission, named
by the HCE two months ago to forge a consensus on the country's political
future.
Since the vote was cancelled, Algeria has been gripped by violence, blamed
by the authorities on Moslem militants, in which 1,800 have died.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Ukraine nears nuclear deal: Kiev claims preliminary pact on
compensation for arsenal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Ukrainian government said at the weekend it had reached a preliminary
agreement with the US and Russia on the 'idea of compensation' in exchange
for Ukraine's relinquishing of its nuclear arsenal.
There was no confirmation of the deal yesterday in Washington or Moscow.
However, Mr Al Gore, US vice president, said in Budapest at the weekend that
'all sides will tell you that progress is being made.'
If a concrete agreement on financial compensation for uranium is worked out
in subsequent talks, it would remove one of the three main conditions
Ukraine has imposed for giving up its remaining 176 strategic missiles and
becoming a non-nuclear state.
Kiev's other two demands are technical aid for dismantlement and security
guarantees.
Ukraine's presidential foreign affairs adviser, Mr Anton Buteiko, also
reported in an interview with the Financial Times that during trilateral
talks, which lasted until midnight, experts were finalising agreements on
technical assistance and progress was being made in negotiations on
guarantees.
According to the government press service, Mr Valery Shmarov, deputy prime
minister, said: 'The idea of compensation for tactical weapons was
accepted.' He was referring to the 2,760 short-range nuclear warheads
Ukraine transferred to Russia last year. Mr. Shmarov hoped that compensation
for these warheads would offset Ukraine's Dollars 2.5m energy debt to
Russia.
'As part of compensation for strategic weapons, agreement was reached to
supply uranium for Ukrainian nuclear power stations for five years.'
Trilateral discussions between the US, Russia and Ukraine have been going on
since early autumn. Ukraine's announcement followed two days of talks on
Thursday and Friday.
Kiev's public posture seems to be an attempt to take advantage of the west's
possible new sympathy for Ukraine's security concerns in the wake of the
nationalist victory at the Russian polls. While the west is reassessing its
relations with Russia, Ukraine may be hoping create some rapid momentum to
get the best deal it can.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Budapest storming towards Christmas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
East Europeans had a word for it in the bad old days of the command economy:
'storming', the frenetic effort to fulfil plan targets in the last days of a
month or year.
Some things do not change. In this week before Christmas, investment and
common-garden bankers, executives, lawyers and brokers are racing to beat
deadlines as breathlessly as communist-era coalminers and steelworkers ever
did.
Lawyers are pulling all-nighters at Baker &amp; McKenzie. 'You can cut the
atmosphere with a knife,' says Mr Peter Magyar, partner at the law firm.
'Everybody is just incredibly tense.'
The Kempinski, Budapest's premier hotel, crawls with 'stormers' desperately
trying to complete deals in time to get away for Christmas or at any rate
before the new year.
So what is going on? The capitalist financial year is proving as hard a
taskmaster as the communist plan period and, in age-old Hungarian fashion,
everything has been left again to the last minute.
Hungary's generous investment incentives giving five-year tax holidays
expire on December 31. So privatisers, foreign buyers and their advisers are
trying to rush through transactions before the new year. 'I've never had so
many deals going on at the same time,' says Mr Peter Kadas of investment
bank Credit Suisse First Boston.
The privatisation timetable for Matav, the Hungarian state telecoms company,
is so tight that participants call it insane. 'I wish they would learn that
Christmas is the season for relaxation,' says Mr Ed Mattix of US West, one
of the telecoms companies bidding.
Hungary's bankers too are busy preparing for extraordinary general meetings
next week at the three largest, and deeply troubled, commercial banks.
Shareholders have to agree to the terms of a government bail-out to restore
their capital before closing the 1993 accounts.
Not everyone is storming, however. Most Hungarian manufacturers close down
over between Christmas and the New Year and factory workers can take it
easy. The communists had another expression: capitalist exploitation. This
is capitalism. But who is exploiting whom?

France has expressed concern to Finland about increased Finnish forestry

diplomatic note that the matter could be settled in a way that did not
affect Finland's negotiations to join the European Union, Mr Antti Satuli,
general director for external economic relations, said.
Foreign trade minister Mr Pertti Salolainen said he took the French note
'very seriously'. 'There is a possibility that if we can't reach an

Four people - including three children - were taken to hospital with minor
injuries yesterday after the IRA detonated a huge landmine in Londonderry.
The bomb, which was aimed at a passing British army patrol, was the first

It gave a clear sign that the IRA is not observing an unofficial ceasefire
while deciding on its formal response to the Major-Reynolds peace

FT  20 DEC 93 / Risk and Reward: Grabbing the tiger's tail with HK warrants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Grabbing the tail of the Asian tiger that is the Hong Kong stock market has
been easier for investors since October, when the American Stock Exchange
began listing a series of institutionally-issued warrants on its own
capitalisation-weighted index of 30 representative companies traded on the
Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
Designed to track the popular Hang Seng index, the Amex 30 Hong Kong index
was created to give US dollar-oriented investors a highly leveraged means of
betting on Hong Kong's rapid equity expansion and diversifying their
portfolios into an emerging market.
With the Hong Kong stock market up 98 per cent over the last 12 months, as
measured by the FT-Actuaries World indicies in local currency terms, its not
surprising New York's main investment houses have been tumbling over
themselves to bring Amex-traded Hong Kong warrants to market.
PaineWebber was first, selling 2.6m Hong Kong 30 call warrants and 2.4m put
warrants to the public on October 26 and listing them for trading on the
Amex. They were followed by a Morgan Stanley Group issue of 6m call warrants
on November 2 and a 1m issue of call warrants by Salomon on November 5. Bear
Stearns issued 1.5m put and 1m call warrants on December 10 and Merrill
Lynch rounded out the selection, issuing 1.6m call warrants on the Amex Hong
Kong 30 on Friday.
Aside from Hang Seng futures traded in Hong Kong, the Amex warrants are the
only exchange-traded derivative product available on Hong Kong equities.
While global money managers can access the market through direct investment
and structured derivative transactions, smaller investors have had to
purchase specialised Asian mutual funds to ride the rally.
The Amex warrants' popular price - almost all of them sold in the Dollars 5
range - have attracted a broad range of investors. They have two or
three-year durations, with all expiring well before Hong Kong is due to be
handed back to the Chinese in 1997.
At expiration, warrant-holders are paid the cash value represented by the
index. They can be actively traded, and do not have to be held to
expiration.
The PaineWebber calls were issued in October at Dollars 4.75 each, with a
strike of 440.09 on the index. The index has since climbed to 531.76, while
the value of a PaineWebber call has jumped to about Dollars 6.50.
The warrants, like options, are used for portfolio diversification. Call
warrants allow an institution to 'tilt' its portfolio toward an active
market without the capital required for direct share purchases.
Put warrants can be purchased to protect profits from existing investments.
Traders holding profits from owning Hong Kong stocks will buy the puts as
cheap insurance against a market reversal. The alternative - liquidating
stock - eliminates potential gains if the rally continues.
With the Hong Kong market overdue for a downside correction, some Wall
Street traders believe the timing of new warrants is a little late for
investors to catch the crest of rally.
The fear of a correction in a raging bull market prompted Merrill Lynch to
engineer a 'reset' clause into the Hong Kong 30 call warrants it priced on
Friday. Merrill will allow warrant buyers to 'reset' the strike price of the
issue in 60 days, shielding them against losses should the index turn down
in the interim.
'The reset provision really sets our product out from the other Hong Kong
warrants,' said Mr Stanton Green, vice-president of equity derivatives for
Merrill Lynch. 'We included it because it was clear our clients wanted it.'

FT  20 DEC 93 / International Company News: Bad debt provisions hit net
result at GiroCredit

<TEXT>
GiroCredit, the Austrian investment bank and clearing institution for the
savings bank sector, expects a sharp rise in operating profits this year but
net profits will be hit by bad-debt provisions.
On the basis of results in the first 11 months, GiroCredit expects operating
profits for the whole year to be around Sch2bn (Dollars 168m), compared with
Sch1.3bn in 1992. But the bank will have to make provisions of Sch1.4bn to
cover bad debts and costs related to the purchase of OCI, a small savings
bank, in 1992. No dividend will be paid for 1993.
After a supervisory board meeting on Friday, Mr Hanz Haumer, chairman, said
he hoped 1993 would be the last year the bank has to draw on its hidden
reserves to cover debts.
Next year, GiroCredit is expected to start to benefit from a Sch3bn package
of measures, approved by shareholders in November, designed to cut costs and
increase revenues over a three-year period.
Mr Haumer was also optimistic that a solution would be found in the next few
weeks for the long-awaited reorganisation of the savings bank sector with a
new ownership structure for GiroCredit.

support

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Skopbank, the biggest casualty of Finland's banking crisis, is to receive a
further FM350m (Dollars 60.5m) in state aid so that it continues to meet
capital adequacy requirements.
The new injection means the bank has received FM17.03bn in government
assistance since it was rescued by the Bank of Finland in September 1991.
The government guarantee fund, which has been responsible for Skopbank since
June 1992, warned that the bank might need further support next year, even
though its performance has improved substantially during 1993.
Credit losses are expected to be 40 per cent lower in 1993 than the FM2.8bn
level struck last year. In the first eight months the group made a FM870m
operating loss after credit losses reached FM885m.
Skopbank's role as the central bank of the Finnish savings banks has been
reduced following the sale of the Savings Bank of Finland to four other
banks.

FT  20 DEC 93 / International Company News: IMI expects to float more than
40% of shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mobiliare Italiano (IMI), the second big bank on the Italian government's
privatisation list, expects to float more than 40 per cent of its shares,
well above original expectations.
The higher total, which contrasts with earlier estimates that only up to 20
per cent of IMI's shares might be sold, suggests the Treasury could raise
more than L2,500bn (Dollars 1.5bn), based on informal valuations.
Further details are likely after a special IMI board meeting on Wednesday to
approve the draft prospectus for the flotation, due in February.
The pricing will not be revealed until next month, but IMI has already
indicated its shares will be sold for between L9,800 and L11,000 each, with
a one-for-10 bonus issue for domestic retail investors who hold the stock
for three years.
By contrast with Credito Italiano, Italy's seventh biggest bank, which was
privatised this month, the IMI deal will be targeted principally at
institutional investors, especially abroad. IMI last week said between 60m
and 120m shares would be sold to Italian retail investors, representing
between 10 per cent and 20 per cent of its share capital.
According to one senior executive, the domestic retail tranche will
represent only about half the shares to be privatised. This implies that the
overall deal could involve up to 40 per cent of IMI's capital.
That would be a compromise between the original plan to float no more than
20 per cent of IMI, which specialises in long-term corporate lending and
fund management, and later suggestions that the Treasury should dispose of
its entire stake, rather than sell the shares in tranches.
The banker said the IMI deal might be brought forward slightly to enable the
government to privatise Banca Commerciale Italiana, the big Milan based
bank, before new general elections, expected in March.
BCI had been due to be sold in early April, but the Treasury's advisers have
pressed for an acceleration to late February to avoid being overshadowed by
the elections and to benefit from the bandwagon effect of privatisation
after the Credito Italiano float. About 100,000 applications for Credito
Italiano shares were turned down due to oversubscription.
The banker denied IMI might swap places with the better known BCI in the
privatisation queue in order to maximise revenues for the Treasury. Any more
than a marginal change in the schedule would cause uncertainty in
international markets and could prove counter productive, he argued.

FT  20 DEC 93 / International Company News: A triumph of hope over
experience - The background to United Airlines' employee ownership deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is the USA in the grip of a workers' revolution? You might think so, to look
at what is happening to its airlines. One by one, they are succumbing to
employee ownership.
At the end of last week United Airlines, the biggest US carrier, and its
labour unions agreed a deal which - if ratified by shareholders and union
members - will give employees up to 63 per cent of the company's shares in
return for Dollars 5bn worth of savings in labour costs.
It is the most spectacular so far in a series of similar deals. Earlier this
year Trans World Airlines agreed to give employees 45 per cent of its shares
in return for Dollars 660m worth of labour cost savings, and Northwest
Airlines agreed a plan giving employees up to 37.5 per cent of the company's
equity in return for Dollars 886m worth of concessions.
Nor is the United deal unlikely to be the last. Mr Robert Crandall, chairman
and chief executive of American Airlines, the second biggest US carrier, has
already said he would welcome a share ownership proposal from his employees.
Delta Air Lines and USAir may not be far behind.
The simple explanation for this phenomenon is the big airlines' desperate
need to cut costs. Smaller carriers like Southwest Airlines are transforming
domestic air travel in the US into a no-frills commodity business in which
only the lowest-cost carriers can compete.
The big airlines have been fighting back by trying to cut their labour
costs, which represent their biggest single operating expense.
Thousands of jobs have already gone: now the carriers want to cut remaining
employees' pay and make them work harder by changing working practices.
Not surprisingly, employees are unenthusiastic about the prospect and their
heavily-unionised status gives them the power to resist attempts to impose
changes unilaterally - as demonstrated by last month's strike by American
Airlines' flight attendants.
Carriers are therefore trying to buy employees' compliance by offering them
equity stakes in their companies equal to the net present value of the
savings expected to flow from their sacrifices.
Even then, it is not proving easy. Northwest only reached agreement with its
unions when it was on the brink of bankruptcy. TWA was already bankrupt, and
only won a deal because it formed part of a 'do-or-die' rescue plan.
United looks different: it is nowhere near bankruptcy, yet has won what
appear to be vast concessions from its unions. In return, however, it has
had to yield so many shares to its employees that they will effectively
control the company.
Will the result be drastic changes at United? One early consequence is that
Mr Stephen Wolf, the company's 52-year-old chairman and chief executive, is
likely to step aside.
Mr Wolf has already hinted at his desire to move on when the deal is done,
and the unions want to replace him with 58-year-old Mr Gerald Greenwald, a
former vice-chairman of Chrysler.
In other respects, however, much the same management will go on running the
company in much the same way.
The employee representatives will have the power to veto decisions on
extraordinary matters such as big acquisitions or disposals. However, as
with Northwest and TWA, they will have only two or three seats out of 12 or
13 on the board, so they will not be in a position to dictate corporate
strategy.
Rather, the intended effect is more subtle. As with other employee share
ownership plans, the management's hope is that employees who have tied up a
sizeable piece of their net worth in the business will be more inclined to
drop confrontational attitudes and work harder for the company's success.
At TWA, for example, flight crews have been giving up their spare time to
take part in promotional tours for the airline around US travel agencies.
Yet the idea seems a triumph of hope over experience. Largely as a result of
a boom in employee share ownership plans during the 1980s, about 10,000 US
companies are partly owned by their employees. It has yet to be conclusively
shown, however, that companies that have employee ownership perform better
than those that do not.
Significantly, the US airline industry has been here before. In the
mid-1980s, when the industry faced similar troubles, employees acquired 9
per cent of Continental Airlines, 11 per cent of Trans World Airlines, 13
per cent of Pan American World Airways, 15 per cent of Republic Airlines, 15
per cent of Pacific Southwest Airlines, 25 per cent of Eastern Airlines and
33 per cent of Western Airlines - in all cases trading wage concessions for
equity. They also acquired substantial shareholdings in People Express and
America West.
Ominously, it did not appear to help: all nine companies went bankrupt or
succumbed to takeovers. If United's plan is to prove revolutionary, it will
have to do better than that.

FT  20 DEC 93 / International Company News: Partial privatisation for
Malaysian utility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The electricity supply company in the East Malaysia state of Sarawak is to
be partially privatised through a reverse takeover of Dunlop Estates (DEB),
formerly a unit of the UK's Dunlop Malayan Estates.
The Sarawak Electricity Supply Co (Sesco) is the sole provider of
electricity in Sarawak, one of Malaysia's biggest and most resource-rich
states.
In one of the biggest deals undertaken in Malaysia, 45 per cent of Sesco, at
present fully owned by the Sarawak state government, will be sold to DEB for
some MDollars 750m (USDollars 294m). At the same time Sesco will acquire a
60 per cent stake in DEB for nearly MDollars 1.5bn.
The deal forms part of a wide-ranging privatisation programme.
Analysts say that by reversing into DEB, Sesco will gain access to stock
market funds, enabling it to expand and participate in several big
infrastructure projects planned in Sarawak. The most prominent of these is a
proposed MDollars 30bn hydroelectric project along Sarawak's Rejang river,
which will be capable of producing 2,500MW by the year 2005.
Dunlop was acquired from Dunlop Malayan Estates by the Malaysian
Multi-Purpose group of companies in 1981. Since DEB sold its plantations in
1990 its main focus has been on gaming operations - held through its
controlling interest in Magnum Corporation, the operator of Malaysia's
largest and most profitable lottery.
In a corporate restructuring announced in November, DEB said it intended to
sell its 52 per cent interest in Magnum to DEB's existing shareholders. The
transaction will raise an estimated MDollars 1.04bn, part of which will be
used to complete the Sesco deal.
Analysts say that though the government in Sarawak will still control Sesco,
DEB will be able to exercise considerable influence on the way the utility
develops.
DEB and the Multi-Purpose group are part of the business empire of Mr Lim
Thian Kiat, who at 34 is often described as Malaysia's youngest tycoon.
Multi-Purpose's activities include banking and other financial services,
property development and a small shipping fleet.

FT  20 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Wellcome in US Aids alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wellcome, the pharmaceuticals group, has formed an alliance with Vertex
Pharmaceuticals, the Massachusetts-based biotechnology group, to develop
orally active protease inhibitors against Aids and HIV, the virus causing
Aids.
The agreement is worth up to Dollars 42m (Pounds 28.1m) to the US group.
Protease is an enzyme essential for HIV to replicate.
Wellcome will pay an initial Dollars 15m and provide research support and
payments for agreed development milestones. In return, the group acquires
the rights to develop, manufacture and market Vertex's HIV protease
inhibitors in the US, Europe and other countries outside east Asia.
In April, Vertex signed an agreement with Kissei Pharmaceutical of Japan, to
develop orally active drugs against HIV for the Chinese and Japanese
markets. Under terms of the agreement, Kissei could pay Vertex up to Dollars
20m.
Other companies which are exploring the use of HIV protease inhibitors
include the Du Pont-Merck joint venture, Upjohn, and Abbott of the US, and
Roche of Switzerland. The Roche compound is probably furthest developed and
has demonstrated some efficacy in humans.
Wellcome's move is part of a continuing strategy to forge links with
biotechnology groups. In December last year it appointed Mr Mark Weedon to
the newly-created post of group licensing director. The deal is one of the
first results from the new US licensing team. A team has been set up in
Japan, and further agreements are expected next year.

FT  20 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Manders sells paint side for Pounds 55m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a sharp, sudden and, in the words of Mr Roy Amos, chairman, 'emotional'
change of strategic direction, Manders has sold its decorative paints
division to Johnstone's Paints, a subsidiary of Total Oil Holdings of
France, for Pounds 55m cash.
Last Thursday the Wolverhampton-based group announced that it had bought the
printing inks and graphic supplies business of Croda International for
Pounds 26.7m cash. Friday's sale will all but wipe out Manders' borrowings.
Mr Roger Akers, Manders chief executive, said in a statement that the recent
rationalisation of the UK decorative paint industry (with the acquisition by
Akzo, the Dutch group, of Crown) had limited the potential for growth in
that part of the group's business.
There had also been consolidation within the printing inks industry, making
it important for Manders to identify which market it should develop. The
group would now 'concentrate on speciality chemicals with an emphasis on
printing inks'.
With Akzo and ICI the two main forces in the UK decorative paints industry,
Manders only had 7 per cent of the market. Kalon, which in June 1992
launched an unsuccessful Pounds 106m all-paper bid for Manders, has about 12
per cent. After yesterday's sale, Total will have about 15 per cent.
Mr Amos said that Johnstone's had undertaken to continue to manufacture
paints at the Wolverhampton and Bingley factories for five years, though he
conceded that there would be some rationalisation on the depot side.
Manders' decorative paints division, Mr Amos said, was set this year to make
'a little more' than last time's Pounds 3.6m (Pounds 2.2m) operating
profits, which gives a 'good p/e of 20'. Turnover last time was Pounds 53.5m
(Pounds 37.4m) and the asset value is Pounds 20.5m.

FT  20 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Vestey's new management prepares finance
changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Vestey Group, one of the largest privately-owned companies in the UK,
has appointed SG Warburg as adviser to help refinance the company.
Warburg is believed initially to be focusing on normalising financial
arrangements between Union International, the indebted trading arm of the
Vestey group, and Union's bankers.
It is understood that Union is about the come out of the standstill arranged
with its bankers last year and that medium-term banking facilities will be
established, allowing it to operate under normal trading conditions.
Peat Marwick, the accountant, is believed to be advising on ways of
restructuring the group's debt while NM Rothschild, the merchant bank, has
been called in by Mr Terry Robinson, chief executive of Union, to advise on
floating part of its east Asian businesses on the stock markets in Australia
and New Zealand.
The changes are part of a strategy being put in place by a new management
comprising Sir John Collins, former chairman and chief executive of Shell,
who was appointed chief executive of Vestey in September with effect from
next month, and Mr Robert Cooper, former director and head of corporate
finance at Robert Fleming, who has been appointed finance director.
Union has been reducing its net debt, now believed to be a little more than
Pounds 100m. Earlier in the year, it reported it was operating profitably
and that its net debt was down to Pounds 202m in the year to December 31
1992 from Pounds 327m 12 months earlier.

FT  20 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Rebels fail to oust Fife directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rebel shareholders in Fife Indmar, the Scottish engineering and distribution
company, have failed to topple the chairman.
At an extraordinary meeting in Edinburgh, shareholders defeated an attempt
to oust Mr Gavin Hepburn, chairman, and Mr Michael Munro, director, and
replace them with Mr Guido Crolla and Mr David Chassels.
The rebel shareholders had made allegations of costly acquisitions and poor
financial management.
Mr Hepburn said he looked forward to getting on with running the business
and continuing to serve the interests of shareholders.
Mr Crolla, who led the rebels and who retains a 2.5 per cent stake in the
company, said: 'The shareholders have voted and we accept their decision. We
were fully justified in the actions we took and we hope that the outcome
will be a better Fife Indmar and a better return for shareholders.'
Mr Chassels said over 40 per cent of the shareholders who voted had backed
the rebels. He urged the board to address the issue of corporate governance.
'It is wrong that there should be only one independent director - the other
board members are brothers, the financial adviser and the company
secretary.'

FT  20 DEC 93 / UK Company News: LWT condemns Granada bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Weekend Television yesterday condemned as 'inadequate and
opportunistic' the hostile offer from Granada worth more than Pounds 600m,
and urged shareholders to reject it.
Sir Christopher Bland, the LWT chairman, said in a letter to shareholders
that the offer from Granada, the rental, leisure and television group,
requires them to exchange their holdings in 'a highly regarded television
company for shares in a conglomerate earning half its profits in a low
growth sector'.
The LWT chairman also said the cash alternative of 528p a share was too low,
and acceptance of the share offer would result in a fall in dividend income
for LWT shareholders.
In what is clearly the first salvo in a long campaign, LWT concentrated on
its own track record and future prospects.
It emphasised that since December 1989 only four companies of the 811 in the
FT-Actuaries All-Share Index had increased the value of their shares more
than LWT. 'By contrast Granada was the 247th best performer in the index in
this period'.
The document points out that Pounds 100 invested in both companies' shares
on December 15 1989 would have returned, including dividend, Pounds 755 from
LWT and Pounds 176 from Granada.
LWT was now the third largest ITV company in terms of share of net
advertising revenue, whereas Granada fell from third to fifth place between
1982 to 1992.
'Granada may need LWT to make sense of its television business but LWT
doesn't need Granada,' said Sir Christopher.
The LWT chairman also promised shareholders a profit estimate and
recommended dividend for 1993 in the new year. Analysts are suggesting
pre-tax profits of around Pounds 36m compared with Pounds 30.6m last time.
Mr Gerry Robinson, chief executive of Granada, said yesterday the LWT board
seemed to be confused: it admitted that scale was necessary in television,
yet rejected the only logical combination in terms of advertising revenue,
audience size, financial strength and licence payments.
'In the meantime Granada is offering a generous multiple of 32 times
historic earnings or 27 times market estimates for the current year which
reflects the high opinion that Granada has of LWT's business.' Mr Robinson
said.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Saatchi to shake up US networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Saatchi and Saatchi, one of the world's largest advertising groups, is
preparing to shake up its three agency networks in the US, its biggest
market, by splitting off media buying into a separate operation.
The plan, being discussed with Saatchi's main US clients, is being pushed
forward by Mr Charles Scott, the recently appointed chief executive. His
strategy is to turn round the heavily indebted group by winning new
business, cutting costs and increasing operating margins.
The firm approach of Mr Scott, an accountant by background, has led to some
disquiet within the group and to rumours that the founding Saatchi brothers,
Charles and Maurice, have been looking at ways to fund a buy-out of one of
the networks, Saatchi and Saatchi Advertising Worldwide. The group has said
the rumours are 'pure speculation' and the network is not for sale.
Mr Scott's plans for a separate media-buying operation in the US would
follow similar developments in Europe. Zenith Media, Saatchi's media
planning and buying arm, is set for rapid expansion next year, financed by a
proportion of the proceeds of a Pounds 73m rights issue in May.
The aim is to differentiate the Saatchi networks from their competitors in
the US by offering to clients Zenith's expertise in the purchase of
television, radio and press advertising space. At the same time, clients
would be able to benefit from the discounts that a centralised media-buying
operation could negotiate.
Removing the media-buying function from the Saatchi advertising agencies
would also allow Mr Scott to cut down on duplication of work and to reduce
staff further.
A Pounds 10m extra provision for redundancies - which followed the loss of
two large US accounts worth a total of Pounds 30m for 1994 - plus pessimism
about client spending during the coming year, led to a profits warning two
weeks ago. Analysts' forecasts of pre-tax profits this year of Pounds
24m-Pounds 29m have been cut by about Pounds 6m.

FT  20 DEC 93 / LWT presses on with ITV quartet plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Weekend Television is pushing ahead with a plan to create a quartet
of ITV licences under combined ownership, as part of its defence against
Granada Group's hostile bid.
Only a passing mention is made of the plan in the letter and defence
document sent to shareholders yesterday by Sir Christopher Bland, LWT
chairman. The documents concentrate on LWT's record and prospects, adding
merely that it is in preliminary discussions with Yorkshire-Tyne Tees. There
is an undertaking that any proposals would be put to shareholders for
approval.
Despite City scepticism, talks that might see LWT making an agreed bid for
Yorkshire, and Anglia Television taking over Tyne Tees, appear to be making
progress. Apart from the possibility of creating the largest ITV company, if
the rules were changed to allow it, more immediate agreements are being
pursued.
These envisage LWT, Yorkshire, Tyne Tees and Anglia co-operating on
everything from cost reduction and programme production to advertising
sales.
LWT, as a 14 per cent shareholder in Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, has access to all
board papers and reckons the loss-making company's problems are being dealt
with. Senior executives clearly believe further significant savings can be
made at Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, a company in which Pearson, owner of the
Financial Times, has a stake.
Sir Christopher said yesterday: 'The LWT management have done well for
shareholders and themselves. They can do better and as it happens they like
working together as a team. They don't want to bale out now.' LWT management
holds around 10 per cent of the company.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Deutsche Telekom wins in Hungary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A consortium led by Deutsche Telekom, the German state-owned
telecommunications company, has pulled off eastern Europe's biggest single
privatisation deal after agreeing to pay Dollars 875m (Pounds 590m) for a 30
per cent stake in Matav, Hungary's state telecoms concern.
MagyarCom, the partnership in which Telekom owns 50 per cent plus one share
and Ameritech, the US regional Bell operator, the remainder, also agreed to
support Dollars 4.3bn capital spending at Matav by 2002.
The Telekom group defeated a Dollars 910m bid by Stet International, the
Italian state concern, and its US partner Bell Atlantic. France Telecom and
US West bid Dollars 830m.
The Hungarian authorities said price was not the only factor. The evaluators
had given credit to Telekom's experience in modernising eastern Germany's
telephones. Sources close to Stet, however, claimed its bid was technically
as well as financially superior.
The MagyarCom consortium will hold half the seats and a tie-breaking vote on
the operating committee of Matav. Hungary's state holding company AV RT,
which retains a majority shareholding, reserves the right to nominate the
chief executive, but MagyarCom names the chief financial and technical
officers.
The Telekom group has promised to turn Hungary into a regional
telecommunications hub funnelling traffic from Romania, Ukraine and other
east European countries.
The consortium has given commitments to increase the number of lines by more
than 15 per cent a year so that Hungary can reach line density of 35 per 100
inhabitants by 1999.
A tax holiday of 100 per cent for five years and 60 per cent for the
following five years also contributed about Dollars 200m to Matav's value.

FT  20 DEC 93 / From award winner to can carrier: Heinz Schimmelbusch's
rapid fall from grace as Metallgesellschaft's crisis becomes clear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, the charismatic Austrian ousted as chief executive
of Metallgesellschaft on Friday, was once the darling of German management
circles.
It was only in 1991, at what in Germany is the tender of age of 47, that Mr
Schimmelbusch was elected German manager of the year. Two years later, his
career at the Frankfurt-based metals, mining and industrial group has been
abruptly and ignominiously brought to an end - for alleged mismanagement.
Together with his finance director, Mr Schimmelbusch was fired at a
specially convened meeting of the group's supervisory board. He was accused
of not keeping the board properly informed of problems at MG Corp, the
group's US trading subsidiary which last week forced Metallgesellschaft to
turn to its bankers to fend off a liquidity crisis.
Four further directors were nudged out - two into retirement, two demoted -
and a new management team was appointed, headed by Mr Kajo Neukirchen,
former chief executive of the Hoesch steel group and a restructuring expert.
The scale of the management changes is believed to be unprecedented for so
large a German company. They point to the seriousness of MG Corp's problems
with its dealings in oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
problems which have yet to be quantified as investigations continue.
Equally unprecedented is the turnaround in Mr Schimmelbusch's fortunes. One
of the youngest chief executives of a large German company when he was
appointed in 1988, he quickly won a reputation as a visionary strategist -
able to woo both the Anglo-American investment community and the executives
of Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank and the Allianz insurance group which
together own 26 per cent of Metallgesellschaft's shares and dominate its
supervisory board.
Mr Schimmelbusch, a man capable of being abrasive and charming in equal
measure, joined the Frankfurt-based group more than 20 years ago after an
early career as an economics lecturer and a year with investment banks in
New York.
Wall Street enriched his fluent English with a store of expletives which
sometimes shocked the lunch guests he used to take to his favourite Italian
restaurant on the outskirts of Frankfurt. While armed bodyguards waited
outside, he would deliver his monologues on the future of
Metallgesellschaft, and guests left impressed at the eloquence of a gifted
salesman.
With annual turnover of about DM25bn (Pounds 9.9bn) generated from about 250
subsidiaries, Metallgesellschaft owes its current structure to Mr
Schimmelbusch. His strategy was simple: to reduce the group's dependence on
base metals by making acquisitions in other business areas. Between 1989 and
1992 he spent about DM2.5bn, culminating in one of the biggest transactions
in post-war Germany - the DM1.45bn purchase of the non-paper divisions of
Feldmuhle from the Swedish Stora group.
While the Feldmuhle acquisition, which included the Buderus and Dynamit
Nobel industrial companies, has yielded healthy profits, the focus of his
smaller purchases now seems misguided. His aim was to build
Metallgesellschaft into the largest provider of environmental services in
Europe. The group has nearly 90 subsidiaries in areas such as recycling,
pollution control and decontamination.
Mr Schimmelbusch hoped that other European countries would catch up with
Germany's high standards of environmental legislation. But although turnover
from environmental services was DM2.8bn in the year to September, demand has
simply not developed as planned and profits were a derisory DM31m.
As a strategy aimed at insulating Metallgesellschaft from its dependency on
metals and mining, it failed. The group has been hit hard by the downturn in
metals prices, partly caused by an influx of cheap imports from the former
Soviet Union, and by the severity of the German recession which drove
subsidiaries such as Kolbenschmidt, in autocomponents, into deep losses.
Generous analysts were prepared to give Mr Schimmelbusch the benefit of the
doubt - after all, he could not have foreseen the lifting of the iron
curtain when he initiated his strategy in the late 1980s. Who better than
the 1991 German manager of the year to see through the rationalisation
needed in 1992 and 1993?
However Mr Schimmelbusch squandered the goodwill he had won from the
international investment community and from the German financial and
industrial establishment, which had put him on the pedestal from which he
was toppled on Friday.
He lost it partly through creative accounting. Few analysts believe that the
DM245m profit the group reported in 1991-92 provided a fair representation
of underlying performance. This impression was compounded because the group
was unwilling to present earnings according to the DVFA formula used by most
big German companies to iron out the effects of one-off extraordinary and
exceptional income.
In the end he came unstuck because of the problems at MG Corp, which has
built up its business in marketing and distributing products such as
gasoline and heating oil. When the problems first became public two weeks
ago, Mr Schimmelbusch and the group's bankers insisted there was nothing
sinister. MG Corp had been obliged to make cash payouts - so-called margin
calls - on futures contracts as the price of oil moved down. A mere
technicality, said Mr Hilmar Kopper, Deutsche Bank'schief executive. But
investigations continued and the original assessment had to be revised.
As Mr Neukirchen, fabled in Germany for undertaking the savage restructuring
of the FAG Kugelfischer ball-bearing group, puts his feet under Mr
Schimmelbusch's desk this morning, at least two questions remain unanswered.
The first is straightforward: how big is the hole at MG Corp? The big banks
have hinted that further equity will have to be pumped into
Metallgesellschaft and that the group's pre-tax losses for the year to
September will have to be revised from the provisional DM347m reported last
month.
The second is more far-reaching: what implications will the case have for
German corporate governance? Under the German system, poor management is not
corrected by the fear of takeover, but by the actions of the supervisory
board. How well did the Metallgesellschaft supervisory board supervise Mr
Schimmelbusch?
Friday's statement said Mr Schimmelbusch was ousted because he failed to
keep the supervisory board informed about developments in the US, which
might have been in breach of German corporate law. The board - headed by Mr
Ronaldo Schmitz of the Deutsche Bank - will no doubt claim to have acted
swiftly in ejecting Mr Schimmelbusch once the scope of MG Corp's plight
became clear.
But the big German banks are particularly close to Metallgesellschaft as
shareholders, creditors, providers of financial services and as board
directors. Given this degree of closeness, it is surprising they did not
identify Mr Schimmelbusch's weaknesses earlier.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Bentsen seeks to dilute Gore attack on IMF role in Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD, GEORGE GRAHAM, EDWARD BALLS and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW, WASHINGTON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Senior US government officials have sought to dilute criticism of the
International Monetary Fund over its policy on Russian economic reform
following a scathing attack last week by Mr Al Gore, the US vice-president.
Mr Gore, who left Moscow on Saturday night after an eight-day visit, had
urged the IMF board to pay more attention to the hardship in Russia caused
by reform.
But in Washington yesterday, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, treasury secretary, said
international financial institutions had to retain some conditions on
assistance to Russia 'to keep the pressure on the reformers'. He insisted
the blame for Russia's problems could not be placed on efforts to reform too
fast.
'I don't believe that when you are having 10 to 20 per cent inflation a
month that means that you are having excessive reform,' Mr Bentsen said.
Another senior US official cautioned against making the IMF a scapegoat for
the inability of the Russian government to implement reform. 'Russia's
economic problems have much more to do with too little reform than too
much,' he said.
However, as Mr Gore returned to Washington, officials travelling with the
vice-president renewed the attack, alleging the IMF's approach had been
inadequate in the run-up to the Russian elections, in which anti-reform
parties won a large vote.
One official with the vice-president said: 'Setting extremely ambitious
macro-economic targets and using the achievement of these targets as a
yes/no, do or no-do switch for the release of western aid - and then
watching vigorous efforts fall just short of the target set is
insufficient.'
On Saturday, Mr Gore won a sympathetic hearing during talks in Germany with
chancellor Helmut Kohl, although Bonn did not join his call for a shift in
the IMF's strategy.
The IMF says there is no Russian budget for 1994 and the only statement on
economic policy has come from Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister. Mr
Chernomyrdin said at the weekend that Mr Yegor Gaidar, first deputy prime
minister, as architect of President Yeltsin's radical market reforms, bore
some blame for the election setback, Reuter reports from Moscow. He told
Trud newspaper that Mr Gaidar and Mr Anatoly Chubais, privatisation
minister, 'should think it over hard'.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Quangos lift spending by 10%: Unelected bodies take larger
share of public purse as numbers grow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unelected quangos are growing in number, employing more staff and taking a
larger share of public expenditure, according to research by the Financial
Times.
Quangos, quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations, increased spending
by more than 10 per cent in the year to last April, much faster than
inflation.
They now account for more than a fifth of public expenditure, with NHS
trusts running hospitals, Housing Action Trusts financing the building of
homes for rent and an increasing number of schools and colleges becoming
independent of local authorities.
The government last year further reduced the number of quangos providing
central government services. Casualties included the Legionnaires Disease
Code of Practice Working Party and the Visiting Committee for the Royal
College of Art.
However quangos still offer central government advice on matters such as the
choice of wine for official hospitality functions (Government Hospitality
Fund Advisory Committee for the Purchase of Wine), the trade in bananas
(Banana Trade Advisory Committee) and acceptable place-names for new towns
(The Place Names Advisory Committee).
New quangos continue to come into life, led by the Citizen's Charter Panel
of Advisors and the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority.
The Housing Corporation, which distributes government grants to housing
associations in England, is the biggest spender in this year's FT top 40
quangos list, spending more than Pounds 2.3bn. The corporation has risen
from 10th place last year following the boost given to its budget to buy
unsold homes as part of the housing market package in the 1992 Autumn
Statement.
Health service quangos remain among the highest spenders, with more than
half of all quango spending being in the NHS. However, the fast-growing
legal aid bill has pushed the Legal Aid Board up to 11th place and brought
its Scottish equivalent into the top 40 for the first time.
Only one urban development corporation, that for London Docklands, remains
in the top 40 - there were five in last year's list. New entrants include
English Heritage, which looks after historical buildings and monuments, and
English Estates, which builds business premises in depressed areas. The
British Library also enters the top 40 for the first time.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Accountancy board divided on changes to handling of goodwill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Accounting Standards Board will today unveil two alternative proposals
for the treatment of goodwill in companies' accounts after its own members
were unable to agree a common line on one of the most controversial issues
in accounting.
Goodwill is the difference between what a company pays to acquire another
business and the value of the net assets of the company acquired. It
measures intangible assets, such as customers' goodwill, which are being
acquired. But some companies have used goodwill in an attempt to disguise
the high price they have paid for an acquisition.
The board's eight members were equally divided between allowing companies to
put goodwill into a special reserve, or hold it on the balance sheet and
write it off as its value diminishes over time. Mr David Tweedie, the
board's chairman, said yesterday that if no agreement emerged he planned to
hold open hearings to resolve the issue.
This approach would mark a significant shift from the way the board usually
makes decisions, through consensus and behind closed doors. When the board
debates the topic again next year, two members will have changed. The
selection of their replacements will be influential in determining the
outcome.
The board acknowledges that goodwill is an accounting anomaly and that there
is no complete solution for the way it can be treated. Current practice in
the UK is out of line with the rest of the world, which requires goodwill to
be written off over a number of years.
The board proposes six options, but will recommend two:
Goodwill should be capitalised on a company's balance sheet and amortised
over a fixed period of probably 20 years. If the goodwill has a longer
economic life, it should be amortised in accordance with an annually
reviewed procedure. Goodwill could be transferred to a separate reserve
immediately a company is acquired and its value assessed annually.
The paper says that intangible assets, such as brands and patents, should be
subsumed within purchased goodwill and not treated separately. Comments on
the paper are due before April 30. This should lead to more detailed
proposals in the autumn.

FT  20 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Property valuation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Trafalgar House's three rights issues in short order have at least enabled
it to write down its assets to a realistic level. Some of these revisions,
though, have thrown up further questions about the subjectivity of property
valuations - in particular, the swingeing writedowns taken on Trafalgar's
joint venture developments at Paddington Basin and Chiswick Park.
Previously, Trafalgar had booked these on the basis of their projected
values on completion, relying on forward assumptions about yields, costs,
and interest rates. But doubts about how quickly these projects can be
finished have led Trafalgar to revert to a current valuation basis for these
sites. Using the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors' red book,
Trafalgar House has now cut the carrying value of its share of the Chiswick
Park development from Pounds 38m to Pounds 8m.
This is all perfectly prudent. But in the case of Chiswick Park, it will
leave its partner, Stanhope, in something of a quandary. How each partner
chooses to value an investment in a joint venture is a matter of subjective
opinion which can legitimately vary according to accounting policy and
timing. The joint venture company itself last valued the whole Chiswick Park
site at Pounds 50m. It would appear decidedly odd if Stanhope did not follow
Trafalgar House's lead. At least it does not have to worry about its
carrying value until its next year-end in June. Its first priority is to
raise Pounds 160m of badly needed equity finance.

FT  20 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: BTR
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is always unsettling to see a company's shares slip without apparent
reason. BTR's fall from favour this autumn, which has seen it under-perform
by 20 per cent since its peak in August, is a case in point. The immediate
explanation seems to be fresh focus on the Pounds 305m provisions taken
after the Hawker acquisition, and the extent of the company's short-term
debt. Some Pounds 2.8bn of bank and other loans or 88 per cent of total debt
was repayable within two years at the end of 1992, though the company also
had cash of Pounds 1.06bn.
Yet the Hawker provisions are nothing new. Nor is there any sign that debt
is troubling the company. If its debts were getting uncomfortable, BTR would
hardly have splashed out Pounds 550m buying Rexnord this month. BTR's
short-term debt jumped after its acquisition of Hawker. It has been coming
down since then. A legitimate question, though, is the pace at which it
falls in the second half of the year.
The company's cautious interim statement is not particularly encouraging in
this regard. Weak markets, for example in aerospace, may reduce the need for
working capital. But the chances are that the company may be heavily reliant
on disposals, the enhanced scrip and warrant conversions. Next year,
underlying cash flow should improve - not least because the Hawker
reorganisation will be over. Meanwhile, by taking large provisions and
running up its short-term debt, BTR has made itself vulnerable to
speculation. But at 354p, its shares yield 4 per cent, and the company is
much less hemmed in than Hanson after Quantum.

FT  20 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: UK accounting
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK business community is divided on the thorny issue of accounting for
goodwill. The Accounting Standards Board is no exception. Today's discussion
paper offers two methods of treating goodwill, the premium to net assets
paid by companies on acquisition. Half the board's members believe that
goodwill is not a measurable asset and should be written off to reserves.
The rest maintain that it should be capitalised in the balance sheet. Rather
than writing off all goodwill over a fixed period, though, companies would
depreciate only if the investment falls in value.
The second approach might have the virtue of capturing companies which
overpay for acquisitions, since big depreciation charges should result. But
that assumes a watertight method of valuing companies can be found. The
discounted cash flow test suggested by the ASB depends on assumptions about
margins and overheads, which are highly subjective. The ASB hopes to prevent
abuse by insisting on a second test, based on the past performance of the
acquired company. Whether that would be sufficient to prevent
over-optimistic valuations remains, at best, unproven.
Still, if the method is shown to be sound, the approach deserves a fair
hearing. The wider danger is that companies and accountancy firms might come
to dominate the debate. Two-thirds of written responses came from these
parties during the last attempt to find a solution. The onus is on
shareholders and other users of accounts to make their views known. A
politically acceptable solution which detracts from transparency is not a
desirable outcome.

<TEXT>
International investors worried about the turn in US interest rates might
take heart from the behaviour of Wall Street. US equities have remained
remarkably calm in the face of rising bond yields. The yield on 30-year
treasury bonds has risen by half a percentage point since mid-October as the
economy has gathered momentum. Short-dated issues have started to anticipate
that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in the early part of next
year. But one or two bouts of nerves aside, the equity market has held its
ground.
One reason is that even bears of the US bond market concede that long-dated
yields are unlikely to rise much above 6.5 per cent next year, from 6.3 per
cent now. While the outlook for growth is starting to improve, unit labour
costs remain firmly under control. The output gap is wide enough to allow
several quarters of above-trend growth before serious inflationary pressure
are felt. If growth fell away in the first quarter of next year, long bond
yields might even trickle back.
A sharp tightening of short-term rates could still cause trouble. With
shares yielding so little and the outlook for dividend growth poor, equities
would surely suffer from higher returns on cash. Tomorrow's meeting of the
Fed's Open Market Committee will doubtless stoke speculation. Respectable
employment figures in the new year, combined perhaps with early signs of a
resurgence of bank lending, would be reason enough to nudge rates higher.
Given the uptick in bond yields this autumn, a gentle rise in interest rates
should be already in the price.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Leading Article: UK training
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For roughly a decade there has been a strong consensus around the view that
raising the skill level of its workforce is the UK's most important
microeconomic priority. After a week which has brought the first sighting of
skill shortages in the West Midlands, as well as a widely publicised attack
on the new system of National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs), it may seem
that this consensus has not produced much in the way of worthwhile results.
But given the structure of the UK labour market and the lack of the formal
framework on which training is based in other countries, reform was always
going to be a long haul. And the overall picture is less gloomy than recent
news suggests. Britain now has, for the first time in its history, a
national system for company-based training, in the shape of the employer-led
Training and Enterprise Councils and the employer-devised NVQs. Both have
their shortcomings, but they are not set in stone and can be improved with
experience.
They are also taking shape in a much more friendly environment than 10 years
ago. Training budgets were cut less in this recession than in the last. And
the latest Labour Force Survey finds that 2.8m employees of working age
received job-related training in the four weeks prior to being interviewed,
an increase of 69 per cent over 1984.
Much of this training effort is being concentrated on elite groups, such as
computer specialists, or takes the form of crash courses to compensate for
the fact that initial training in middle range craft and technical skills is
so poor. It is with the latter in mind that the government has now come up
with a third leg to its training effort - a 'modern' apprenticeship scheme,
to be launched in autumn 1995. This is a long time to wait, but at least the
delay shows that the government is not seeking short-term political
advantage.
There is also enough time to work out an appropriate combination of public
and private financing, something which in-company training has not had
before. Indeed, the apprenticeship scheme might be an opportunity to
experiment with German-style collective employer funding, topped up by
public funds, in an effort to reduce the temptation for companies to poach
skilled workers rather than train them. The fact that young people's wages
are continuing to fall ought to help.
The NVQ system needs refining: it should be more stringently tested and less
job specific. For all its faults, though, the current training framework
does try to integrate training with real business needs, something which the
grandiose plans of the 1960s and 70s often failed to achieve. Handing
training over to employers is not on its own a solution. Combined with
financial incentives which encourage more employers to provide quality
training, it can be. The government is still shuffling in the right
direction.

The considerable cash spent every Christmas by British households on trivia
knowledge games is evidently wasted.
In a recent Gallup poll of more than 1,000 adults, just 11 per cent recall
Pete Sampras as winner of this year's mens' singles champion at Wimbledon;
28 per cent come up with the right name - Steffi Graf - for the womens'
singles.
Only one in three remember the names of the two world boxing champions -
Chris Eubank and Nigel Benn - whose October fight ended in a draw.
Literary and artistic general knowledge is also abysmal; only 14 per cent
know that William Golding wrote Lord of the Flies, while just 35 per cent
correctly pinpoint Tchaikovsky as the composer of the 1812 Overture. A
paltry 23 per cent accurately say that ERM stands for exchange rate
mechanism.
Clearly standards of education are not what they should be. Complaints
should be addressed to John Patten, education minister. But then, according
to the same survey, only 25 per cent of us know who he is.

Those of you who imagine the European parliament to be a dull old place,
stuffed with humourless Eurocrats - think again.
At least one Euro MP - Caroline Jackson, a Tory from Wiltshire - is showing
distinct signs of wit. She has just written to Egon Klepsch, president of
the parliament, to see how many of her fellow 515 deputies are still alive.
She says: 'For a year I have been sitting next to an empty chair assigned to
an MEP from Naples. He has not turned up for any debate or any vote for a
year. Is he possibly dead? In which case I am very sorry, but maybe he
should not be being paid his salary, not to mention half his office
allowances.'
Jackson adds that 'some MEPs have not been seen for years. How many other
dead souls might there be?'
Of course there is always another side to an argument. Perhaps Jackson's
Neapolitan neighbour has got the full measure of the place and is engaged in
a lengthy, though silent, boycott?

Now that Kenneth Clarke's first Budget has bedded down, some entertaining

Quick learner she may be - Keswick won plaudits for November's Budget - but
clearly she had to be.
Soon after Clarke took over as chancellor, at a meeting with some of his key
key advisers, Keswick put a question to a neighbour: 'Let me get this
absolutely clear. Direct taxation refers to this year, and indirect to next
year, am I right?'
But noblesse oblige: Treasury colleagues still loyally speak of Keswick's

Some board insiders favour another Scot, Ian Percy, head of the Scottish

Accountants of Scotland.
That would sustain the kilted caucus which dominates the musty world of
accounting and auditing in the UK, since another tartan number-cruncher,
David Tweedie, is chairman of the Accounting Standards Board.
But word is that the top dogs at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in

FT  20 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Europe's steel deal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The fury of private steelmakers over Friday's deal by European Union
industry ministers on state aid is understandable. Unsubsidised steel
businesses, mostly private-owned, will be damaged by the agreement to
approve Ecu7bn in hand-outs to inefficient state-owned companies in Germany,
Italy, Spain and Portugal. Closures of more efficient, unsubsidised plant
are now likely.
The acceptance of blatantly unfair competition in the steel industry also
sets a worrying precedent. In coming weeks, the European Commission will
consider whether to approve state aid to several national airlines and Bull,
the French computer group. It must be hoped that its negotiating position
has not been weakened by the steel deal.
Yet it is also clear that it was never going to be politically possible to
enforce a no-subsidies regime for steel. The German, Italian, Spanish and
Portuguese governments would not have agreed to a course of action that
brought about large and highly visible job losses in regions which already
suffer from high unemployment.
The question is therefore not whether aid should have been approved, but
whether a sufficient price was extracted in return. The main quid pro quo
was an agreement by the offending governments to close 5m tonnes of
capacity, and not to give their companies any more subsidies. But there were
also fudges: new capacity is being built in Germany, while some of the
Italian plant being 'closed' has not been producing steel since 1991.
Mr Karel Van Miert, the competition commissioner who managed the deal,
argues that it was not possible to take a tougher line because the Treaty of
Paris, which covers steel and coal, requires subsidies to be approved
unanimously, so giving every country a veto.
But it is not clear why the requirement for unanimity could not have been
turned into a strength rather than a weakness. After all, without agreement,
aid is illegal under the Treaty.
Of course, such a move would have sharply raised the stakes and would only
have been possible with the full support of other commissioners. In
particular, Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, would have had to
become publicly involved.
A tougher line would have produced a fairer deal. Even if governments had
refused to make further capacity cuts, it should have been possible to
extract other concessions. For example, the Commission could have insisted
that member states which subsidised their steel companies compensated
unsubsidised competitors for the damage.
It may now be too late for a compensation scheme in the steel industry. But
such an arrangement should be part of any future deal which involves the
European Union approving state aid. Not only would this ensure redress for
those harmed by unfair competition. It would also make governments think
twice before handing out subsidies.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Charity lottery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Would Britain's national lottery raise more money for good causes if it gave
its profits to charities rather than to shareholders? Mr Richard Branson,
the airline entrepreneur, and Lord Young, the former Tory minister who now
runs telecommunications group Cable &amp; Wireless, say it would. Their Lottery
Foundation plans to bid for the lottery on a charitable basis when the
licence is put out to competitive tender this week. All their rivals are
profit-driven.
Charity gives Branson and Young a public relations edge. But while it is
welcome that the two men are giving their time for nothing, that should not
be a decisive factor. Profit is not a dirty word, but an important means of
motivating people. Not only have both Branson and Young preached the gospel
of enterprise in the past. Their lottery will also provide suppliers with
the opportunity to make profits, precisely because they feel that the
operation must be commercially-orientated.
Moreover, it is not as though all the money from a profit-driven lottery
would go to shareholders. They will get only what is left over after
payments to the government's fund for good causes, prize money, lottery duty
and administration costs. Because the licence will go to the bidder with the
best prospect of maximising funds for good causes, there should be little
opportunity to earn monopoly profits. Indeed, it is even possible that the
winner will end up losing money if it overbids.
The central question is therefore not whether handing the lottery's profits
to charity is intrinsically ethical but whether doing so would help maximise
the proceeds for good causes. According to the Lottery Foundation, there are
two reasons why it would. First, more people would play because they would
feel good about the profits going to charity. Second, there would be lower
financing costs because shareholders would not need to receive dividends.
Neither of these arguments looks all that compelling. Most of the evidence
suggests that people play lotteries because they hope to get rich, not
because they feel charitable. Moreover, although the Lottery Foundation
would not pay dividends, it would still need to raise debt to finance its
operations.
Lack of equity might even be a drawback not an advantage. Without the
comfort of an equity cushion, lenders might insist on higher interest rates.
And if it was saddled with a high gearing ratio, the lottery would probably
have to run itself conservatively. As a result, it could be prevented from
pursuing strategies that maximised the return to good causes.
This is not to say that the Branson/Young bid should be rejected on a priori
grounds. It may hold out the best prospect for maximising funds for good
causes if, for example, its rivals are too greedy. If so, it will deserve to
win. Otherwise, not.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Stick to shake at workplace: German cost-saving labour deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Robert Bosch group started it. A year ago, when most of German industry
barely suspected how deep a recessionary hole it was in, the publicity-shy
electronics concern was already digging its way out.
It had decided to build a new semiconductor facility. Its preferred site was
Reutlingen, home since 1971 to most of its sophisticated electronics
capacity. The snag was that for technical reasons, the plant had to be run
round-the- clock, seven days a week, and the trade unions would have none of
it.
Negotiations started and planning went ahead - for two sites, one in Germany
and one in Scotland. By February this year the package was complete. The
German unions had overcome their ingrained opposition to weekend working.
With little fanfare, the DM200m investment was approved for Reutlingen, 300
jobs were secured, and the Scots were out in the cold.
A month later, the company told its German workforce that despite a
cost-cutting programme, some of its products were still 30 per cent more
expensive than those of foreign competitors. As a result, the
previously-agreed 3 per cent pay rise, due on April 1, would apply only to
basic pay. All the 'traditional' perks and bonuses would be excluded from
the calculation, saving the group DM250m a year. White collar workers
received letters telling them their salaries would be reduced by 3 per cent.
Bosch, with more than 150,000 workers worldwide, had successfully set about
undermining two of Germany's notorious structural defects - a seemingly
unbreakable upward pay spiral and inflexible working practices - which
hitherto appeared to have condemned all the country's manufacturing to a
future of fading international competitiveness.
Since then, there have been several variations on the Bosch stick-and-carrot
theme, with, unusually for Germany, rather more emphasis on the stick than
the vegetable.
By threatening to build a new factory outside Germany for its projected
A-Class mini car, Mercedes last week wrung concessions on operating
economies from unions worth a claimed DM200m.
General Motors had previously struck a similar deal for a 475-job diesel
engine line to be installed in Kaiserslautern in preference to any of the
nine other options under consideration outside Germany. Volkswagen, by
threatening 30,000 job losses, recently won agreement to reduce working
times which will mean real reductions in net income of up to 12 per cent for
100,000 employees.
So far these signs of a new order have been confined mainly to the
automotive industry (Bosch is a leading vehicle components maker) which has
been worst hit by recession. But the results, achieved with little or no
serious industrial unrest, suggest that if the process can be kept up and
extended into the deeper reaches of the industrial base, German
manufacturing may soon be back on the road to international competitiveness.
Whether or not, as some union leaders and politicians claim, employers are
gaining the upper hand through the use of coercion or blackmail, the
acceptance of change is spreading rapidly through the industrial workforce,
and the beginnings of a snowball effect are already apparent.
GM's engine plant deal, for example, set the tone for a parsimonious
four-year agreement, signed last month, covering all 50,000 employees of
Adam Opel, the US group's vehicle-making subsidiary in Germany. This
includes workers accepting only two-thirds of any nationally-agreed pay
increases for the duration of the deal. All of Mercedes' German employees
agreed to less generous pay and conditions arrangements to safeguard 3,000
jobs at the Rastatt plant.
The most obvious assumption prompted by the events at Bosch, GM and
Mercedes, in particular, is that the companies believe they will now be able
to make semiconductors, diesel engines, volume cars and high-class minis and
sell them at competitive prices anywhere in the world market. It may not yet
be wholly true, but the signs are that progress is being made, and that the
premium-earning 'Made in Germany' label has more of a future than many would
have believed 12 months ago.

FT  20 DEC 93 / East, west - home's best: FT writers examine Mercedes-Benz's
decision to locate its new plant in Germany rather than elsewhere in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FT writers
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just three months ago, Mr Helmut Werner, the elegant Mercedes-Benz chief
executive, gave the Financial Times an exclusive. Chatting enthusiastically
about his planned Vision A car, the company's first venture into the small
car market, he said Mercedes was looking for a European site to be devoted
exclusively to making 200,000 annually. Four countries were under
consideration: Germany, the UK, the Czech Republic and one other. A week
later it emerged that France was also on the list. According to Mr Werner, a
decision would be made by the end of the year.
The rush was on. In Britain, for example, the Northern Development Company,
NDC, responsible for economic regeneration in north-east England, reacted
within 24 hours to a request from the Department of Trade and Industry for
details of potential 250-300 acre sites.
Bidders now admit it was curious that Mr Werner should publicise sensitive
plans at such an early stage. It was even more curious that he should be
scouting around for a greenfield site when he had a perfectly good,
state-of-the-art factory standing almost idle in Germany. Was it conceivable
that the ultra-respectable Mercedes was playing an elaborate game? Was it
cynically using its international prestige and credibility in an attempt to
bluff or brow-beat its German workforce into accepting tough new working
conditions in return for the job of building the new car?
The story and the issues it raised were ignored by the German media. They
were preoccupied with the Daimler-Benz subsidiary's demands that its 85,000
workforce must accept cuts in perks, bonuses and other benefits which would
save Mercedes DM200m (Pounds 79m) a year. Days later, Mr Edzard Reuter,
group chairman, was piling on the agony at a press conference. Productivity
at Mercedes had to increase 40 per cent by the end of 1997; the group
workforce was to be cut by 44,000 in 1993 and 1994, and 27,000 of those jobs
would be lost from the automotive arm, he said.
But the Mercedes workforce representatives, aware that the A-Class project
and 3,000 jobs were at stake, were not going to give up DM200m easily. The
pressure on the workforce increased: Daimler's Deutsche Aerospace subsidiary
promptly announced the closure of six German factories and sites. Management
in the AEG division made sure the world knew of an impending sell-off,
including the off-loading of its domestic appliances to Electrolux.
The Mercedes workforce was left in no doubt that group management, after
years of talking about restructuring and changes in attitude, was now taking
action.
Last Wednesday, when Mr Reuter revised the group-wide job loss total up to
51,000, a somewhat flustered Mr Werner told journalists that the A-Class was
to be built at an existing, one-year-old Mercedes works in Rastatt, close to
the eastern French border, and that a package of DM200m cost-savings had
been agreed with the unions in an early-hours dash the previous night to
meet the management's deadline.
A similar message was sent out simultaneously to the foreign contenders for
the A-Class factory. 'We still thought Arras was a serious contender right
up until Wednesday morning,' says a local authority official in the northern
French town. Mr Patrice Joosep, director of economic expansion at the local
chamber of commerce, says he was disappointed. 'But we always knew Germany
would be a stiff competitor. That's the name of the game in projects like
this,' he adds.
The British contenders, aware that the Rastatt plant was already built and
under-used because of a collapse in demand for cars, say they had additional
cause to doubt the earnestness of Mercedes' approaches. It was unusual for a
site-search of such importance to be announced publicly, and the three-month
timescale was curiously short. But they swallowed their scepticism.
According to Mr Robert Haymon-Collins, head of marketing at the West
Midlands Development Agency, the short notice made it difficult for his
office to put packages together. 'It was all off-the-shelf stuff,' he
admits. But given that Mercedes would need easy access to an east-coast port
 -the A-Class is intended as a strictly European city car - his area dropped
out of the serious running fairly early in the process. Chatter, gossip and
exchanges of notes between local authorities and London ministries indicated
that this was the way Mercedes was thinking. Even so, Mr Haymon-Collins
says: 'We treated the project with due credibility, although one could have
predicted the outcome.'
The NDC, which has wide experience in the inward investment maze and 375
foreign successes, including the Pounds 900m Nissan car plant in Sunderland,
says it was well aware that Mercedes might be using the foreign search as a
lever in its negotiations with domestic unions. 'But we all take the view
that until a deal is done there is everything to play for,' says Mr Les
Henson, chief executive of the County Durham Development Company, which
worked together with NDC on the project.
'When an agreement depends on negotiations with a third party which may not
succeed, then 'plan B' (a move outside Germany) would come into play. We
treated it very seriously on that basis,' he added.
Mercedes, too, handled the search with convincing thoroughness, underlined
by personal site visits from Mr Werner himself and Mr Peter Martens,
director of the A-Class project. Mr Chris Fraser, operations director of the
NDC, remains convinced by the seniority of the people involved and their
methodical approach that the Mercedes team was seriously evaluating real
options.
It was shown two sites, both in Newton Aycliffe, during a one-day visit on
November 2. The agencies' efforts were reinforced by the involvement of Mr
Ian Gibson, head of the local Nissan operation, and Mr Llew Aviss, personnel
chief of the nearby Fujitsu microchip plant.
The Yorkshire and Humberside Development Association, YHDA, offering sites
at Doncaster and Hull - both ports already used by Mercedes for shipping
parts and vehicles - was chary at first. 'But then it got very serious
indeed,' said Mr Mark Saville, the association corporate affairs manager.
'If it was all bluff, we are convinced the people looking here did not know
anything about it.'
A German team, led by Mr Martens, garnered more information than even
companies that had actually moved into the region in the past. Two YHDA
staff were seconded to the project full-time. Mr Martens appointed local
agents and consultants to assess the sites. The association produced an
exclusive promotional video for screening in Germany.
The touring party also apparently paid serious attention to the Czech
Republic, where four towns volunteered themselves. The Stuttgart team
descended on a 100-hectare former army base close to the Skoda engineering
works in Pilsen. Mr Vladimir Dlouhy, trade and industry minister, was not
very optimistic when he emerged from follow-up talks on November 22. After
all, earlier talks with the group on establishing a Dollars 250m trucks
joint venture, had collapsed only in March.
After the Rastatt announcement, the disappointment appeared greatest at the
YHDA, which at one stage put other jobs to one side and set all its 30 staff
to work on the project. There was more stoicism further north. The NDC's Mr
Fraser found the experience valuable. 'Being on the shortlist will stand us
in good stead in future,' he said. His County Durham colleague, Mr Henson,
agreed: 'An experience like that makes you better prepared for the next
large project that comes up. We're just waiting for the next one now.'
As Mr Henson suggests, optimism is a far more valuable quality than
scepticism in real-life business dealings. Events of the past few days tend
to prove the thesis. As the FT has since learnt, the Arras town hall
spokesman was right that his area was in the running until the last minute.
The northern French town had been top of the Mercedes reserve list. The
company had made all the necessary arrangements for a press conference in
Paris last week to announce that the plant was to go to Arras.
But the media invitations were not faxed. At the last minute, German union
officials swallowed their scepticism about the seriousness of Mercedes'
threats. They surrendered the DM200m savings demanded by management, and
secured 3,000 German jobs.

FT  20 DEC 93 / The 'new' frontier in economics: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Neoclassical theory is simply an inappropriate tool to analyse and
prescribe policies that will induce development. It is concerned with the
operation of markets not with how markets develop. How can one prescribe
policies when one doesn't understand how economies develop?'
I quote from the provocative Nobel prize lecture delivered in Stockholm this
month by Professor Douglass North of Washington University in St Louis.
North's sceptical remarks deserve attention given the turmoil in Russia, and
to a lesser extent, eastern Europe. Most of the advice these countries are
getting from western institutions such as the International Monetary Fund is
based on the 'neoclassical' theory (orthodox market economics) that North
denigrates.
North, originally an economic historian, is a champion of the so-called 'new
institutional economics'. In his view, neoclassical theory begs all the
important questions.
The crucial neoclassical assumption is that individuals seek to maximise
their income or satisfaction in a world where resources are scarce. They
thus make 'optimising' choices. For example, people work up to the point
where the income from their last hour of labour just equals the value of the
leisure foregone. With some important caveats, such assumptions lead to
laisser faire prescriptions: governments should sit back and leave
production to competitive markets and free enterprise.
The problem, according to North, is that this assumes a frictionless, static
world in which 'transactions costs' (the cost of specifying what is being
exchanged and of enforcing agreements over time and space) are zero. Such a
world never has and never will exist. In reality, the impersonal exchange
between millions of participants required in a dynamic market economy
imposes formidable transactions costs. People, for example, need to be
certain that contracts will be honoured years into the future.
As a result, economic performance depends crucially on the setting in which
market exchange occurs - on complex institutional arrangements that
neoclassical theory takes for granted. By institutions, he means 'rules of
the game'. These include formal rules (such as legal property rights) and,
importantly, informal 'norms' of behaviour - for example a reluctance to
shirk or cheat even when there is little risk of discovery. The institutions
that happen to exist depend on inherited ideologies - the 'mental models'
that people use both to explain the world and to prescribe how it ought to
be. Too often these are inimical to progress.
Formal rules can be changed overnight. But informal codes of conduct and
ideologies change slowly. It is these that prevent rapid economic
improvement in formerly communist countries and much of the third world.
This, then, is the new 'institutional frontier' with which economists must
grapple.
North's arguments are impressive and irritating in almost equal measure. The
notion that institutional economics is new is faintly absurd if one
considers classics such as Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations (1776). Smith
certainly understood the importance of institutions and ideology; indeed he
set out to change the rules of the game. And politicians such as Pitt the
Younger soon began to put his ideas into practice, creating the conditions
for Britain's commercial efflorescence in the 19th century. 'What an
extraordinary man Pitt is; he understands my ideas better than I do myself,'
Smith remarked at a London dinner party.
Nor could Karl Marx be charged with indifference to institutions and
ideologies. The problems of the former communist countries seem intractable
precisely because Marxian concepts such as 'exploitation' became so deeply
entrenched. In our own century, several distinguished economists struggled
valiantly to change people's mental models and hence bring about
institutional reform. This was the raison d'etre of Austrian critics of
socialism such as von Mises and Hayek.
North, however, has emerged from the Anglo-American neoclassical tradition
of recent decades. His criticism of his peers - be they at Harvard, Chicago
or the London School of Economics - is justified. Many leading academics
have a narrow intellectual outlook. They have become too absorbed with the
mathematical properties of ideal (and implausible) economic models. If
North's Nobel prize brings them to their senses - and makes them focus on
the real world - it will have performed a singular service.
My other cavil about North is that he seems to have few concrete policy
proposals. It is helpful to emphasise that the success of policies will
often depend on prior changes in attitudes and institutions. But I doubt
this comes as a surprise to the hard-pressed officials struggling with
reforms in formerly communist countries. What they need are practical
suggestions. North is quick to criticise neoclassical ideas. In a recent
paper for the Cato Institute, a Washington think tank, he dismissed
privatisation as a 'simple-minded notion' and a 'travesty of institutional
reasoning'. All right, so what does he recommend?
The answers are presumably to be found in North's first love: history.
Against the odds, some countries have effected stunning transformations of
their institutions and ideologies. The best examples are Japan's Meiji
Restoration and the recent rise of the Asian 'tigers'. These countries
successfully transplanted a version of western capitalism into quite
unpromising soil. This is where the new institutional economists should dig
if they hope to produce relevant policy prescriptions. In the meantime, the
soundest guide is the proven wisdom of thinkers such as Adam Smith.

FT  20 DEC 93 / A spur for the gene hunters: The mapping of mankind's
genetic make-up sets a medical landmark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Annual fund-raising telethons, added to a Dollars 10m bequest, have financed
an astonishing tour-de-force for French science: the first 'map' showing the
entire genetic make-up of mankind. It will help researchers move more
quickly to identify the genetic causes of thousands of diseases.
Last week's publication of the 'physical map of the human genome' by the
Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (Ceph) in Paris is a landmark in
medical research. And it rounds off a golden year for genetics - the most
productive since 1953 when James Watson and Francis Crick discovered the
double-helix structure of DNA, the chemical that encodes genetic
information.
During 1993, the world's researchers have found the precise genetic cause of
scores of inherited diseases, including Huntington's chorea, a type of
dementia, and several forms of cancer. Ceph says its map will enable gene
hunters to move 10 times faster in future. There is now a real prospect of
deciphering all 3bn chemical 'letters' in the human genetic code - known
collectively as the genome - by 2000.
'Before today, a physical map existed for only two per cent of the human
genome; our map covers about 90 per cent,' says Dr Daniel Cohen, the
ebullient director of Ceph. He is a natural performer - whether explaining
genetics or playing the piano at the annual telethon, sponsored by the
French muscular dystrophy association, which raises Dollars 12m a year for
gene mapping at Ceph and its daughter laboratory, Genethon.
American gene mappers, who receive Dollars 165m a year from the US
government's grandiose Human Genome Project, have been amazed by the rapid
progress at Ceph and Genethon. But they were happy to swallow national pride
and acclaim the French achievement. Dr Francis Collins, head of the US
National Centre for Human Genome Research, calls the map 'an enormous
practical boost to gene hunters'.
'This will allow scientists throughout the world to discover more quickly
the genes that cause diseases such as muscular dystrophies, epilepsy,
diabetes, asthma, cardiovascular (heart) disease and certain cancers,' says
Dr Glen Evans, director of the Salk Institute's Human Genome Centre in
California.
Researchers looking for the cause of an inherited disease search first for
'genetic markers' - stretches of DNA near the target gene that are present
in patients but not in other people. Now, they should be able to find these
markers like landmarks on the new map and home in quickly on the gene
responsible.
Researchers can produce a diagnostic test for a inherited disease as soon as
they know the genetic cause. A treatment takes much longer to develop. Take
for example cystic fibrosis, the lung disorder, for which the gene was
identified in 1989. Widespread testing for CF started in 1991, but the first
clinical trials of CF gene therapy - delivering correctly functioning copies
of the defective gene to patients' lungs - did not begin until this year; at
least five years further clinical development will be required before this
treatment becomes widely available.
Asked why his team was first in the world to produce a genome map, Dr Cohen
points out that he started before anyone else: 'I founded Ceph in 1983 with
Jean Dausset (a Nobel-prize winning geneticist) using a Dollars 10m bequest
from a French art collector. So we had six years experience before the Human
Genome Project was launched in the US in 1989.'
Others attribute Ceph's success to Dr Cohen's single-minded enthusiasm. 'He
created a unique environment in which to carry out such a large-scale task,
at a time when it was not possible anywhere else,' says Dr David Bentley,
head of human genetics at the Sanger Centre near Cambridge in the UK. 'He
identified the best techniques and automated them very effectively.'
Ceph and Genethon operate 30 robots to do much of the work performed by
scientists and technicians elsewhere - an unprecedented level of automation
in biology research. The essential technology for labelling and detecting
DNA fragments was developed in collaboration with Amersham International,
the UK life sciences company.
Creating the map is like solving an immensely complicated biological jigsaw
puzzle - cutting up DNA in different ways with enzymes and fingerprinting
the fragments to see how they overlap and fit back together.
The French scientists do not work with raw human genes. Instead they have
refined a trick originally invented in 1987 in the US. They cut the human
DNA into large pieces and transfer them into yeast cells. As the yeast grows
and divides, it produces clones of the human DNA, known as yeast artificial
chromosomes. These YACs are then sliced into smaller fragments for detailed
analysis.
Dr Francois Gros, the geneticist who is secretary of the French Academy of
Sciences, describes the resulting physical map as 'a continuous ordered set
of DNA fragments, essentially a guidebook to the genome'. But to the
untutored eye, it looks like an incomprehensible jumble of overlapping
horizontal lines and vertical bars of different lengths, labelled with long
strings of letters and numbers.
The data would form a pile of paper as high as the Eiffel Tower, if printed
out in full. A 'condensed' version will be published as a 300 page book
early next year. But any researcher wanting to use the map will have access
to it on the Internet computer network, which connects scientists around the
globe.
'We have introduced a new style of communicating data,' Dr Cohen says. 'We
have tested the database with some of our international collaborators but I
guess it will take a few months before everyone gets used to it.'
As a point of principle, Ceph and Genethon will not try to patent the map or
any of the information in it. But they recognise that, under the present
rules, researchers elsewhere could use the map to identify specific genes
and then patent them for diagnostic or therapeutic applications.
International collaboration on a large scale will be needed to fill in the
gaps in Ceph's map, find inaccuracies and improve its resolution. The aim is
eventually to decode all of the estimated 100,000 human genes and know
precisely where each gene lies on the 23 chromosomes that make up the human
genome. This is likely to be achieved in the first decade of the next
century.
Dr Cohen promises the excitement of genetic research will feed through to
patients, in the form of improved treatments and eventually cures. 'In 10 to
20 years most of the diseases caused by single gene defects, like cystic
fibrosis, will be cured,' he says.
The most serious ailments of western society, such as heart disease, mental
illness and cancer, result from a far more complex interaction between
multiple genes and the environment in which we live. But, Dr Cohen says, 'in
50 years most of these serious diseases will also be cured - and 50 years is
almost no time in the history of medicine'.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: PEPs, private investors and a lack of
concern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER SPENCER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr J D Wittle made a good point in his letter 'Crestfallen investors'
(December 11) about the seeming lack of concern for the private investor in
the drawing up of plans for the Crest share settlement system.
I think there has been a similar lack of concern in the way that personal
equity plans (PEPs) have been allowed to develop and I would like to feel
that pressure will continue to be brought to bear on both matters.
Surely the Treasury - and the Bank of England - should see that the
respective systems take fully into account the needs of the private
investor.
In the case of Crest, it is essential that private investors should not be
disadvantaged by a higher cost structure, but with both Crest and
(self-select) PEPs it seems vital to me that the investors' names should be
'on the register' so that they receive balance sheets, proxy forms etc. The
Bank of England Crest team is said to be wishing to improve what it call the
'visibility' of the relationship between companies and their shareholders
when nominees are used - which I take to mean the same thing]
My plea is, therefore, that pressure should be maintained on behalf of the
private investor in relation to Crest and to PEPs. Certainly ProShare should
be supporting the case and I feel that it would be a great help if you would
continue to publicise the matter on behalf of your private investor readers.

Sir, I am seriously concerned about the recent publication by the Securities
and Investments Board of a KPMG survey on transfers of benefits from
occupational pension schemes to personal pension contracts.
The survey looked at 10 companies out of the 240 members of Lautro, the
self-regulatory organisation - the Prudential was not among them. We have
taken and continue to take a prudent and responsible approach to such
transfers and do not accept the results of the survey apply to pension
transfer policies arranged through Prudential representatives. Nevertheless
we shall of course be happy to discuss any concerns our customers may have.

<TEXT>
Sir, The only real surprise in the current controversy about transfers from
company pension schemes to personal pensions is the extent to which everyone
seems to be so surprised by all this.
The problem mainly falls in two distinct areas:
1. Enticing members of company pensions schemes to opt-out of their company
scheme into a personal pension; and
2. Transferring benefits left behind in a previous company scheme to a
personal pension.
You do not need to be a genius - or even an actuary - to realise that an
occupational pension scheme into which an employer is paying substantial
contributions is normally going to produce much better benefits than a
personal pension into which no employer contributions are made. Evaluating
the option of giving up a deferred pension and taking a transfer value from
a company pension scheme to a personal pension is extremely complex. Very
few advisers have the necessary expertise in both company pension schemes
and individual pension arrangements to carry out such an analysis properly.
Those that can do this normally charge for the time spent on the exercise
and in our experience very few individuals, or financial advisers, are
prepared to pay for this advice.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Barry Riley (The Long View, December 11) is to be congratulated on his
pragmatic assessment of the 'personal pension blues'. As he points out,
there are no implicit flaws in the personal pensions concept - it is the
product design, distribution and regulatory framework which have caused the
problems.
The Financial Services Act has only belatedly caught up with the post-1988
pensions regime. Even now anomalies exist - for example, rights under an
occupational scheme are outside of the FSA. The legislative framework for
pensions is unnecessarily complex - the Goode review team acknowledged this
but was unable to suggest any real simplifications. Many of the
complications are a consequence of conflicting tax and social security
constraints - not least because of the inconsistencies of contracting-out
arrangements.
Personal pension providers have exacerbated matters by designing products
with obscure charging structures, partially to facilitate disproportionate
commission payments - with acquiescence of the regulators. The investment
and interest rate risks associated with any 'money purchase' provision are
real but can be minimised through judicious use of a variety of investment
instruments, including derivatives - and a more flexible approach to annuity
provision - as highlighted by William Burrows ('Escaping the annuity trap',
December 11).
Regrettably future changes will not redress matters for those who have been
ill-advised in the past. However, what is needed is a creative and radical
reform of the whole pension provision infrastructure - not tinkering with
the existing framework and the introduction of further tiers of bureaucracy.
A new style, employer-sponsored personal pension with tax relief dependent
on compulsory employer contributions and limited commission and overall
expense loadings would be a stop forward. The personal pensions golden goose
may not be dead - but it is in desperate need of some swift intensive care.

<TEXT>
Sir, You are right ('Gatt and the media', December 15) that many of the EU
arguments are a smoke-screen for a commercial interest. You have
unintentionally contributed to that smoke-screen by repeating the French
disinformation that the Americans want subsidies for European films cut or
abandoned.
This is not so. What they do feel, and this is highly understandable, is
that their European subsidiaries should benefit from the same subsidies when
the source of those subsidies is a levy on box office receipts and when
those subsidiaries make films in Europe. Far from trying to intervene in the
fiscal policies of sovereign states, the Americans are seeking to eliminate
unlawful discrimination.

Sir, Gillian Tett's article on the developments in the Russian aviation

particularly her descriptions of herb omelettes, champagne and roses.
I think her readers will be less amused, though, to learn that the 161 new
regional carriers in Russia use petrol to power their aircraft. My
information is that kerosine (Jet-A1) is the most likely choice of fuel for
safe and timely arrivals.

Oscar Wilde (1854-1900) knew that in trivial matters, the most important
thing is style, and that in serious matters, the most important thing is
style. All the more surprising that The Importance of Being Earnest at the
Royal Exchange, Manchester, should be so un-stylish.
The director, James Maxwell, has set the play in the early 1900s. The
designs by Tom Rand use an uncomfortable alliance of Rene Mackintosh chairs
and Art Deco in town to contrast with the Arts &amp; Crafts interior in the
country. This is right, in that the play is about the Country versus the
City. But the sets seem extreme, and changing them means two intervals in a
play that should career to a conclusion.
The play could run on its own, without the actors: those lines about
careless children, handbags and railway stations are carefully set in social
aspic for the discerning palate. Add a few cucumber sandwiches and a plate
of muffins and the set would be complete.
The production has two drawbacks. First, the Royal Exchange, in the round,
is disadvantaged with Wilde. His comedy depends on looking at rather than
joining in. A round theatre makes you want to reach out for a slice of the
tea cake, and it makes the actors restless to speak to every part of the
theatre.
The second drawback is that the actors have yet to find their range. Wilde
is all about uncomfortable social situations, and his brilliance in comedy
was to apply a patina of politeness to rank improbabilities. The more
serious the lines, the funnier they appear. Two women in love with the same
man called Ernest who turns out to be Ernest and two separate men is a plot
that needs to be treated with a certain gravitas.
Samuel West as Algernon Moncrieff gets it right in the first act, and Neil
Dudgeon as Jack Worthing in the third. But there is little else of the
play's spirit in between. Lady Bracknell (Avril Elgar) should be a
Dreadnought in heavy seas, but here seems more like a cutter in light winds.
She wears pink, and has what looks like skate wings high around her collar:
this means she cannot be heard, so the lovely lines about courtship ('He is
ostentatiously eligible; he has nothing but he looks everything') and
marriage ('We live, I regret to say, in an age of surfaces') are lost.
The direction should make the actors less restless, the lighting (Robert
Bryan) needs to give the scenes more visual depth, and the action should
proceed with greater rigour. If flirting with your spouse is like washing
your clean linen in public; flirting with Wilde is another basket of laundry
entirely: he will be sure to remind you, even if he has not yet said it,
that only the mediocre are always at their best.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Arts: Perfectly suitable for children - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD

<TEXT>
There is much talk presently about educational theatre. Someone said to me
at the weekend that the reason why Adrian Noble's new production of Macbeth
at the Barbican is so slow is that it is unduly influenced by educational
techniques: you have to play every line as if no member of the audience has
ever heard it before. And I read in another newspaper that current
production of Bertholt Brecht's Mother Courage at the Cottlesloe should
never have been included in the Royal National Theatre's educational
programme because it is unsuitable for children, although - to be fair - the
same critic thought the play was also unsuitable for adults.
My own reservations are different and are prompted by watching The
Fantastical Legend of Dr Faust at the Shaw Theatre in London last week. This
is an adaptation by Michael Bogdanov, artistic director of the English
Shakespeare Company, of the famous Faust story. It is described as 'theatre
for 8-14-year-olds'. The production will tour the UK in the new year before
going to the Middle East.
There is nothing particularly wrong with it. Indeed, the huge puppets in the
show, designed by James Barton, are rather attractive. What I can't
understand is why Faust needs to be rewritten for children. There is nothing
in at least the Christopher Marlowe version of Faust that the young are
incapable of following, and many elements in Marlowe that are a great deal
better than anything devised by Bogdanov: the verse, for example. For no
explicable reason, the ESC has changed Marlowe's lines into rhyming
couplets. As for the seven deadly sins, they were played just as well and
quite as suitably for children, in Marlowe's Dr Faustus at the Greenwich
Theatre last month. It is as though Bogdanov is teaching the children to
believe in Father Christmas in order to learn that the best is still to
come.
*****
Sam Wanamaker, who died at the weekend at the age of 74, almost literally
gave his life to Shakespeare. An American actor who came to England in the
early 1950s, partly to get away from the McCarthy ethos, he dedicated
himself to founding a new Globe Theatre based on the original, as close as
possible to the initial site.
Not everyone was kind to him: local authorities, official arts bodies and
the English theatre establishment could have given him more encouragement.
Yet Wanamaker pressed on. A wonderful German production of The Merry Wives
of Windsor was performed on the foundations of his new Globe early this
year. In a year or so the edifice should be complete. It should bear his
name: for Wanamaker realised what many English do not - the pull of
Shakespeare, and the old Globe Theatre, around the world.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Arts: An end to the Gloriana myth - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This wonderful new Gloriana, which crowns a year of exceptionally successful
activity at Opera North, surpasses all expectations. These were pretty
high-pitched: for this is, after all, the first entirely new British
production of Britten's 1953 Coronation opera for 27 years (and, indeed,
only the third British production in the work's history). And it arrives
soon after the issue, widely and justly praised, of the work's first-ever
recording.
The recorded Gloriana (on Argo) stimulated an excited reappraisal of the
work's qualities. This new staging, a demonstration of British music-theatre
at its most imaginative, will surely take the whole valuable process a great
deal further.
It can hardly be a coincidence that Opera North shares with Argo both the
occupant of Britten's title role - Josephine Barstow, of whose sovereign
vocal and theatrical gifts the occasion affords yet another priceless
example - and an approach to the work that can only be described as
missionary. The myth of Gloriana, the fruit of a misbegotten Coronation
commission, savourless and even sterile in spite of its expertly deployed
Grand Operatic machinery, has taken a long time dying. After Saturday
evening its end must be nearer than ever.
The glitter, sweep and zest of the performance, its speed of unfolding and
command of memorable gesture, its decisive, intimate meshing of 'period' and
'modern' theatrical device, simply bowl one over. These are qualities as
much musical as dramatic: for in look and sound, in the style and deportment
of the large cast (dancers no less than solo and chorus singers), the show
bears the hallmarks of closely unified thought among all its collaborators.
A thread of unassailable theatrical logic binds the production. It is
immediately evidenced in the springy freshness of the orchestral playing
under Paul Daniel, who reveals his admirably firm grasp of the scope and
purpose of Britten's scoring. Over and over the ear is struck by the
particular way the large orchestra is used - 'weightlessly', with a layering
of timbre that at once places the opera's formal and scenic contrasts and
suggests the up-to-date tensions informing the evocation of historical
situations and personages.
Mr Daniel keeps the pacing taut; and so does the staging by Phyllida Lloyd
in the designs of Anthony Ward, a brilliant piece of work. Leitmotifs of the
Elizabethan theatre abound - a wooden-box arena (which put me in mind of the
Hampton Court tennis court) containing every scene, huge shadows suddenly
thrown by footlighting. Likewise, images taken from late 16th century
iconography, bold costume textures and colours creating a sense of
extravagant court ritual that affords the production its peculiar piquancy
of flavour.
There is humour in it, a lightness of touch showering unsuspected benefits
in the Norwich Masque - although even the Lloyd-Ward brand of theatrical zip
cannot render entirely free of Gainsborough Films-style rhubarb the London
street scene and the plentiful embarrassments of its gnomic blind balladeer
(a case for simply cutting the whole scene?). More important, an erotic
energy is tapped from the relationship of Elizabeth and Essex that newly
strengthens Britten's acute balance of private and public worlds - an
uncomfortable and even painful balance, with its resonances alike in
historical situation and in the composer's own emotional and psychological
complexities.
Neither previous account of Gloriana that I have seen (at Sadler's Wells and
at the Coliseum) possessed this unflinching directness. It emanates directly
from the pairing of Barstow's Elizabeth, crafty, tough, violent and generous
by turns, and Thomas Randle's agile, poetic Essex, long locks, lean frame
and sultry good looks perfectly in place, weaknesses and strengths
impetuously commingled. Further playing-in will surely encourage her to
deliver all the sung words as clearly and eloquently as she does those of
the final spoken passages (given in full and wholly justified in context).
He will surely learn to find sweeter lyricism in the lute songs.
Already, both are unforgettable. Around them Opera North has assembled an
attractive young cast, graced by Karl Morgan Daymond's handsome Mountjoy,
Susan Chilcott's incisive Lady Rich, Yvonne Burnett's gentle Lady Essex, and
the precise, distinctively uttered Spirit of the Masque of Paul Nilon. I
love Kate Flatt's choreography, and the wit with which an all-male troupe
carries it off.
No weaknesses? Well, Eric Roberts lacks as yet the art of impressing subtle,
grave authority on every syllable of Cecil's 'Song of Government'. And, as a
general point, the re-disposition of a three-act opera into two parts (with
a long pause at the three-quarter mark) allows the audience insufficient
breathing space between scenes. It also denies them the full impact of
Elizabeth's prayer, which Barstow sings with magnificent concentration -
this should provide the opera's first great curtain-close and here fails to
do so.
Otherwise, highest praise all round. The production visits Covent Garden in
February, and Nottingham, Manchester, Norwich and Hull after that. Head for
the box office now.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Sir Peter Wright's version of The Nutcracker at Covent Garden is a delight.
It is an exemplar of how the old ballets, which are our ancestral jewels,
can be shown off, lovingly and carefully reset, and made to enhance our
dancers.
The secret is that, for once, a producer of the classics has listened to the
score. I am increasingly of the view that some choreographers are deaf, that
others are musically illiterate, and that yet others stick their fingers in
their ears as they enter the rehearsal room. How else to explain the
brutalisms that are inflicted upon the Tchaikovsky scores, and the sheer
bloody-mindedness of the way music, modern and ancient, is maltreated? We
cannot hope for creators as educated and perceptive as Balanchine, who
studied at the Petrograd Conservatoire, but it is a failing in companies
when choreographers are not given guidance with a score. We should be saved
many a chain-saw attack on defenceless composers were there more rigorous
winnowing of musical choices.
Wright has listened to his score, has understood its magic and its
melancholy, and has seen how the overt narrative and the mysterious subtext,
which is Tchaikovsky's vision of childhood, can be made real for us.
Everything works in the staging, and everything persuades us that it is
right. Julia Trevelyan Oman's snowy Nuremburg frames an enchanting
Biedermeier interior, which the Royal Ballet's artists fill with warm,
generous characterisations. Derek Rencher and Sandra Conley preside over the
Christmas party, and they and their guests are winningly shown. The mouse
battle, the Christmas tree's transformation, the haunting figure of
Drosselmeyer (well taken by Stephen Wicks), and the sprightly - but not too
sprightly - cohorts of the Royal Ballet's Junior School, make a spectacle
that combines fun and sudden darker tones that are echt Hoffmann.
The glories of the first act's music - the sublime sweep of Tchaikovsky's
imagination that takes us from the end of the party to the close of the snow
scene - were excitingly clear under Barry Wordsworth's baton on Friday
night, and not one note was betrayed by the staging. I salute the young
Naomi Reynolds as Clara, a delightful child and enchantingly spacious in her
dance with the transformed Nutcracker. And it was very good to see Philip
Mosley again as this hero - youthfully dashing as any little girl could
wish. I salute, indeed, everyone in the first act: they (and Peter Wright)
show us why the score is a masterpiece, and why in Balanchine's words,
'Hoffmann's Nutcracker is a serious thing wrapped in a fairy tale'.
In the second act there must always be problems with those sticky
divertissements. But once we had got through them on Friday, we had Lesley
Collier and Irek Mukhamedov to bring off the great duet with rare authority.
Collier listens to the music: she knows that its sorrows cannot be
expressed, but that to dance it the ballerina must have dignity. Her
performance was wholly apt: subtle in musicianship, pure in statement, with
nothing forced and nothing too beguiling. I have not seen her dance it
better, nor with greater sympathy for its choreographic and emotional tone,
elegiac rather than festive.
I felt happy for the many children in the house; they will have something
very special to remember. They will also have Mukhamedov's noble presence to
recall. The cavalier's part is nothing. Mukhamedov gave it grace of means,
true charm, and very polished dancing.
The Nutcracker continues in repertory at Covent Garden

FT  20 DEC 93 / Arts: Looking for laurels - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By October this year, 11 cities in the UK had applied to be considered as
City of Architecture and Design for 1999, under the Arts Council's Arts 2000
initiative. Each year cities are invited to make bids to the council to host
a year-long celebration of a particular art form. The shortlist for 1999 has
now been announced: it is Edinburgh, Glasgow and Liverpool. Other bids came
from Cambridge, Greenwich and London Docklands.
The awards are more than just hype. In 1992, Birmingham was a successful
City of Music. Next year, the East Midlands will be Region of Dance, which
does not have quite such a ring about it. In 1995, Swansea will be City of
Literature and, believe it or not, there is to be a year of Photography and
the Electronic Image in 1998 and a year of 'rice-planting and the florescent
image' to celebrate the millennium.
We will not know which city has won the architectural nomination until a
series of day-long visits and a fair amount of junketing has taken place to
win the hearts and minds of the selection panel.
The judges have been chosen largely from the Jurassic Park of architecture:
Lord St John of Fawsley; Professor Colin St John Wilson; Sir Terence Conran;
the president of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and one or two
others. There is the wise addition of two people too busy to be on the
full-time panel but who will visit the cities and help make the final
choice. They are Simon Jenkins, former editor of The Times, and Bernard
Rocher, deputy mayor of Paris.
A lot of arts money is spent on these thematic years and the winning city
will receive Pounds 400,000. The Arts Council describes 1999 thus: 'The
focus of the year will be excellence in the promotion of public appreciation
of architecture and design, including landscape and civil engineering
design. Proposals may include initiatives which aim to promote good design
for the public.'
In theory this is a good idea to encourage public awareness of architecture,
although the worrying thing is that it seems to be tied up with the Arts
Council's obsession with 'architecture centres': it cannot be a coincidence
that the three shortlisted cities have promised to build such centres.
These cities should be warned by the fiasco that surrounds the proposal to
build a literature centre in Swansea to an amazing design by Alsopp and
Lyall, leading architects of the avant-garde. The proposal sadly appears to
have bitten the dust. Put not your trust in arts councils.
Architecture centres have only a limited use because the real resource is
the city itself. Books, tours, films and videos are available, but best of
all are a good pair of shoes and a guide so that you can walk and look. I do
not recall Alec Clifton-Taylor or Sir John Betjeman or Sir Osbert Lancaster
ever mentioning the phrase architecture centre - and they opened more eyes
to architecture than any arts bureaucracy can ever hope to do.
Glasgow has certainly discovered the value of promotional skills and is
already adopting a hard-sell approach. Its bid is based on the theme 'The
City as a Living Artwork', which sounds ominous. One of its ideas that will
appeal to restaurateur Terence Conran is a design cafe where designers from
Tokyo, Barcelona and Milan will be linked via computer and video for
discussions over the polenta. I wonder whether designers eat more daintily
than other mortals. We shall see. Designer haggis is rather a frightening
thought.
In its eternal wisdom the Arts Council has decided, according to its
spokeswoman, to promote civil war in Scotland by pitting Glasgow's amazing
talent against the dazzling genius of Edinburgh. Edinburgh plans to base its
1999 International Arts Festival on the theme of architecture and design and
to rely on the excellence of its present urban development programme.
Liverpool is wisely being a little more circumspect because its should, by
any standards, be the winning city. First of all, Liverpool's artistic and
architectural heritage is second to none and is not sufficiently known. It
has great architecture of all periods, from Georgian to the 20th century. It
is also a city that needs as much outside help and support as it can muster,
because of its relatively sudden decline and because it is recovering from a
bad attack of political madness.
It has some of the best buildings in the UK from its days as the
third-largest city, and it has arguably the greatest seaport in the country.
When I recently took an American visitor there, he thought he had arrived in
Athens when he walked out of Lime Street Station. Sterling work has been
done to preserve the city's best architecture and to build some good new
buildings.
Liverpool is by far the most deserving candidate to be City of Architecture
and Design and trendy Glasgow and staid Edinburgh should look to their
thistles because the competition will be tough indeed.

China is giving the Bank of China, the country's foreign currency arm, a
facelift with the appointment of a new chairman of the board and governor,
writes Tony Walker.
State Council, China's cabinet, recently approved the appointments which are
expected to be announced formally today.
Wang Qiren, 52, will become chairman, and 41-year-old Wang Xuebing will
assume the role of governor or president. The appointment of the two Wangs
is part of a trend throughout China's bureaucracy to promote younger
officials to senior office.
They will replace another Wang (Wang Deyan), 63, who has served as both
chairman and governor for the past eight years.
The new Wangs at the Bank of China are seen as proteges of Zhu Rongji,
China's economic tsar and governor of the People's Bank, China's central
bank. Zhu has also been making youthful appointments to the People's Bank
board.
Wang Qiren is currently vice-chairman of China's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs
Office, a politically sensitive post concerned with the colony's transition
to Chinese rule in 1997. Before his move to that job he worked in China's
state-controlled banking sector for 20 years.
Wang Xuebing is currently vice-chairman of the Everbright Industrial
Corporation, one of China's state-owned conglomerates. He is a former head
of the Bank of China's New York branch.
The new appointments coincide with sweeping reforms of the banking sector.
Among changes are attempts to transform the Bank of China and the country's
three large commercial banks into commercial entities in the Western sense.
They have tended to act to this point as cash dispensers to faltering state
industries.

FT  20 DEC 93 / People: Mattiussi's long distance learning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The past 18 months have been unsettling ones for Andrea Mattiussi (above),
chief executive of Lawson Mardon, the international packaging group, writes
Bernard Simon.
From the start, he had to adjust to constant travel between Lawson's head
office in Toronto, his home in London, and the base of Lawson's major
shareholder in Milan. Mattiussi sometimes describes his office as his
briefcase and cellular phone.
But the upheavals keep coming.
Alusuisse-Lonza, the Swiss industrial group, has spent the past month poring
over Lawson's books to decide whether to go ahead with a CDollars 555m
takeover bid. This week, Mattiussi's former boss, Italian financier Sergio
Cragnotti, agreed to pay CDollars 2.7m to settle allegations of manipulating
Lawson's share price and insider trading. Cragnotti, whose investment firm
controls Lawson, was also banned for life from being a director or officer
of any Ontario-based company.
Mattiussi is given high marks for cutting costs and giving a sharper focus
to Lawson's business, most of which is in Europe.
His shrewdest move, however, may have been to put some distance between
himself and Cragnotti. He is said to have vigorously defended the interests
of Lawson's outside shareholders, even at the expense of some friction with
his former employer. That may explain why Mattiussi heard about Cragnotti's
deal with Alusuisse only a couple of hours before it was announced.
If Alusuisse goes ahead with its bid, it will need to decide whether it
wants Mattiussi to stay on as ceo. Last week the Ontario securities
commssion said there was no evidence that Mattiussi or any other Lawson
director was involved or aware of Cragnotti's activites.

<TEXT>
Ask any cross-section of analysts to nominate the toughest big company chief
executive job in Australia, writes Bruce Jacques, and chances are that
Goodman Fielder, the country's largest food group, will outpoll all comers.
So, when long-serving Goodman executive Barry Weir was promoted to the
managing director's post last week, it's scarcely surprising that investors
were underwhelmed.
They've seen it too many times before. Goodman has chewed up three chief
executives in the past half decade, culminating in last week's passing of
the high-profile former Elders executive, Michael Nugent.
Weir now has the task of improving the sluggish performance of the unwieldy
Goodman conglomerate whose structure remains a legacy of 1980s boom time
extravagance.
But he should be well equipped for the task. For a start, he's a survivor.
In his 17 years with Goodman, 58-year-old Weir has seen all manner of
management crises and worked in most parts of the business.
He won the chief executive's post by successfully expanding Goodman's
European operations, based around its Wessanen business, which have grown
under his stewardship to account for 25 per cent of the total business.
As a tested, long-term executive, Weir has a reputation as a team player who
is likely to improve shattered morale by redeveloping old-fashioned
camaraderie among his top executive team.
But Weir will get no honeymoon from the markets. Goodman's record of high
management turnover plus his age already have analysts calling him an
interim chief, 'just keeping the seat warm while the head-hunters find a
more high-powered candidate'.
Against that, the Goodman board is likely to be keen on stability at the top
after its recent experience.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Monday Interview: Ace player's simple sums - Alan Greenberg
tells Richard Waters about his serious money and what he does with it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alan Greenberg - 'Ace' to his friends - looks exasperated. 'I'm just so sick
of hearing about this money thing. I'm so sick of having us compared with
other people.'
The 'money thing' Greenberg is so sick of hearing about is his own,
sizeable, income. Last year it was Dollars 15.8m. This year it is Dollars
15.9m. What's the lowest it has been in the past ten years or so? 'I don't
know, maybe Dollars 4m or Dollars 5m. I don't remember.' Even by the
standards of the well-paid ranks of senior US executives, this counts as
serious money.
But then, as Greenberg says, he is different. He trades shares. Not only
that: he sits at the focal point of one of New York's busiest trading
floors. And this has been a blockbuster year, even by Wall Street standards.
So why should anyone begrudge him his Dollars 15.9m?
Before tackling that thorny subject, it's important to realise that
Greenberg isn't just any share-trader. He's been doing it for decades
('forty four years and nine months,' he points out helpfully) and is said to
be very good at it. Although chairman of Bear Stearns, a securities house
that employs 6,500 people, he spends most of his time at his desk on the
equity trading floor, directing the hubbub.
Greenberg's image as a gruff, wise-cracking trader has hardened around him
like a crust. When delivering interviews from his perch on the equity
trading floor at the Bear Stearns offices on Park Avenue, he slips easily
into the mould that he has created for himself in a succession of interviews
over the years.
He spits out homilies and dispenses no-nonsense views on life and the
markets as if by rote. He favours being photographed with a fat cigar in his
hand. It is disconcerting when quotations from previous interviews, ones
that obviously pleased him, reappear on his lips.
Journalists, you can tell, like this version of Greenberg. His history has
been told and re-told through the years in a rag-bag of anecdotes. The memo
he once wrote telling staff to re-use paper clips, rather than buy new ones.
How, as share prices crashed in 1987, he practised his golf swing on the
trading floor and said he might take the next day off to play a round. His
fondness for playing bridge and impressing interviewers with card tricks (he
is a member of the Society of American Magicians).
Greenberg plays along gamely. Keen to demonstrate his contempt for
high-flown management theorising, he rummages through a pile of paper on his
desk to find 'some of the nonsense people say'. He quotes from various
papers: ''Re-engineering business' . . . 'economic value added' . . . that's
some of the nonsense I have to listen to.' He has done this in other
interviews as well, and it obviously works.
Although much of this is for show, Greenberg really does appear to have a
straightforward approach to running a trading firm. Every Monday, Bears
Stearns' traders attend a meeting where their trading positions are
discussed. A team of spies patrols the floors constantly, trying to make
sure no one is covering up a big loss.
Aren't more sophisticated methods available for managing trading risks these
days? No, says Greenberg. 'People can read things, write things that aren't
exactly true.'
He explains: 'Traders are reluctant to put down accurate prices. That's a
constant problem we and everyone else has. They don't want to show a loss,
and that's a bad mistake. If they do it, they're out - O-U-T' (That also
echoes from a previous interview.)
Not letting small trading losses turn into big ones is one of the very few
trading philosophies that Greenberg admits to. All loss-making positions are
closed, he says. 'We don't carry big losses. We just sell 'em.'
Ask Greenberg what is the biggest loss he has ever been responsible for, and
an interesting thing happens. The gruff front falters for a minute and he
chuckles boyishly. He looks younger than his 66 years anyway, but this makes
him look younger still. Many years before, when Bear Stearns' capital was
only Dollars 30m or so, he managed 'a loss of Dollars 1m, which at that time
was really big'.
So what about the 'money thing' that gets Greenberg so riled? He isn't the
highest-paid Wall Street trader; that bouquet goes to George Soros, Michael
Steinhardt and the rest of the band of so-called 'hedge fund' managers. But
among the heads of Wall Street firms, his earnings were exceeded last year
only by Stephen Friedman and Robert Rubin, then co-heads of Goldman Sachs.
The attention this attracts clearly annoys him. Of nameless critics, he
says: 'They don't know how much money I make for this firm, so how can they
say it's big or little? How can anyone say what I should rate without
knowing what I do?'
Also, Greenberg's basic salary is Dollars 200,000 - the rest comes from
bonuses when the firm is making a profit. 'I don't know of one other
corporation where the top people want to run the risks with their income
that we do. When many companies lose money, the bosses get a raise.'
Well, yes. But judging by Bear Stearns' performance in recent years, the
danger of not making a profit is not that great.
And now the really important questions: how does he spend all that money?
The pleasing boyish chuckle comes back. Greenberg claims not to have any
expensive habits. He recomposes his face, prepares to tell about the
philanthropy that is widely commented on. 'My wife and I give a lot of money
away every year. How much is a personal matter.'
And then there is betting. Small amounts on football (he is a fan of the New
York Giants), much more on cards. 'I like to gamble big at bridge. I like to
gamble. Every businessman is a gambler.'
He slides off into another homily, this time about the importance of
risk-taking in business. But you can tell that only half his mind is on it.
He's impatient to get this interview over and get back to the serious
business of making money.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Business Travel (Travel Update): Venice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Should your business be fortunate enough to take you to Venice, and should
you arrive by air, you will be faced with the question of how to make the
watery transit to the city itself, writes David Lascelles.
For the well-heeled, the answer is simple: jump in a water taxi and enjoy
one of the most romantic city arrivals possible. But be prepared to be
charged over 120,000 lire (Pounds 50) for the pleasure, though you may be
able to cut this by bargaining.
For those on tighter budgets, there is a water bus costing only 15,000 lire
(Pounds 6). But departures are spasmodic, and the trip goes via the Lido,
taking more than an hour.
The real bargain is the Venetian municipal bus service which runs half
hourly (hourly at week-ends) and costs a mere 1000 lire (40p).
Admittedly, it deposits you at the Piazzale Roma, leaving you to take the
vaporetto on to your hotel. But this only costs 2,500 lire (Pounds 1) and
can be a joy in itself.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Business Travel (Travel Update): Trouble spots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Algeria: The number of foreign nationals killed in Algeria over the past
three months now stands at 23, writes Francis Ghiles. The latest incident
took place last Tuesday night when 12 Croats working on a water project were
knifed to death.
Many foreign companies repatriated the families of their employees working
in Algeria in the wake of the first killings last September. Since then a
trickle has grown into a flood though it is difficult to estimated how many
of the roughly 50,000 foreigners working in Algeria remain. The US, Russia
and many European countries have also repatriated the families of staff at
their embassies in Algiers.
French tours operators have cancelled all their bookings for winter holidays
in the Algerian Sahara. Foreign affairs ministries throughout the west are
following the British foreign office line, which is to discourage tourism
and travelling to Algeria except for essential business reasons.
Russia: Cancellations, long delays and overloading of passengers on internal
flights are frequent, particularly in the Transcaucasus.
It is not known whether maintenance procedures are always properly observed.
For safety travellers are advised where possible to fly directly to their
destination on an international flight originating outside Russia.
There have been widespread outbreaks of diphtheria affecting adults and
children. Visitors are advised to seek medical advice concerning this and
other recommended inoculations. Do not drink tap water.
Incidents of mugging, theft and pickpocketing in all cities, especially St.
Petersburg and Moscow, are increasing.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Business Travel (Travel Update): Battle over economy cabins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANNY GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A US survey of couriers' opinions on airlines' economy cabins this week
rated British Airways as the best on international routes and Alaska
Airlines the best within the US, writes Danny Green.
BA was followed by United, Singapore, American and Lufthansa. Alitalia and
Air Canada came in last, in 19th and 20th place respectively.
BA rated especially highly on food, beverages and personal attention. These
were the key factors in its overall victory, said Mr Byron Lutz, who edited
the survey for the International Association of Air Travel Couriers. 'BA is
very good at handing out the free drinks,' he said.
Other notable results of the survey of more than 1,600 couriers was that TWA
scored highest on comfort but lowest on friendliness and food. Virgin
Atlantic was the most uncomfortable but managed to catch up somewhat thanks
to the personal attention it gave.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Business Travel: Spacious sleeperettes take off - Why seat
pitch is all to the discerning business class traveller
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next year KLM, the Dutch carrier, will become the latest airline to revamp
its business and rip out its first-class seats. To be installed are
'sleeperettes', seats that bear more resemblance to dentists' couches than
the armchairs favoured by the biggest carriers such as British Airways,
American Airlines and Japan Air Lines.
KLM is joining a growing band of carriers that have abandoned conventional
cabin classes in favour of larger seats for anyone prepared to pay the
business-class prices.
Others include Continental of the US and Virgin Atlantic in the UK.
The reason behind the changes is that surveys show business travellers want
more space, second only to safety and punctuality.
Additional room is achieved by increasing the seat pitch - the distance
between the rows - which in turn allows the seats to recline further, giving
a less crowded feel to the cabin.
Anyone who has tried the seats in super-business-class cabins knows they are
a revelation. They feel like first class without the vintage champagne and
caviar, and the service is similar to standard business class. But you can
get a much better sleep on long-haul flights.
Of the carriers that have taken this route, the standards setter is US
carrier Continental.
Its Business First cabin has a seat pitch of 55 inches, compared with a
typical business class pitch of 38-40 inches and first class pitch of 60
inches.
Business First is available on coast-to-coast US domestic routes as well as
transatlantic and transpacific journeys. The quality of the product is
reflected in the cheerful demeanour of the cabin crew.
Virgin also has 55-inch seat pitches, in Upper Class, but its ageing cabins
look more than a little frayed.
The seats must be manually pushed into position, an awkward movement that
pales beside Continental's automatic seat backs, footrests and lumbar
support.
Virgin's new aircraft, the Airbus A340, will be fitted with electrically
adjustable seats and will be introduced gradually over the next two years.
So far 55-inch pitches seem to be as far as carriers are prepared to go with
super-business cabins. KLM is likely to fit 48-inch pitch seating, in line
with US carrier NorthWest, in which it has a 20 per cent stake.
Some airlines insist they will not alter their seating. British Airways
argues that there is still a market for the super-luxury of first class
among the rich and famous or industry bosses, whose expense accounts are
checked only by the tax inspector.
But for executives who see air travel as a business tool, the first choice
should be super-business class.
The price should be the same as business class - a round trip from London to
Tokyo costs Pounds 3,179 on JAL, Virgin, BA and ANA - but on most criteria,
the product is better.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Business Travel: Simple lessons in life-saving - How to
survive an air crash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DON MUNRO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What if the plane crashes? It's the unthinkable idea, which - for a moment -
invades the minds of many air travellers during take-offs and landings. Most
of us shrug it off, counting on fate and the expertise of pilots.
But while airline accidents are rare, they do happen. You can increase your
chances of surviving by following some simple, common-sense steps.
These range from the type of clothing to wear on your trip, to picking the
best seat for survival, to how best to walk from a smoke-filled plane.
Begin before you leave for the airport. When dressing for the flight, choose
clothing made from natural fabrics such as cotton and wool. Artificial
fibres, such as those in pantihose, can melt with heat intensity.
Women should not wear tight skirts; trousers make climbing out of windows
and other exits easier. Loop earrings should be avoided, because they can
catch on something during an es-cape.
At the airport try to book a seat close to the aisle over the wings, where
the exit windows are located. If that is not possible, choose an aisle seat
near other exits, such as those near the galleys, along the sides of the
aircraft, at the passenger entry door and, in some aircraft, in the tail
cone. When boarding, count the rows between your seat and the nearest exit
and the number between your seat and an alternative exit. If the lights go
out, you can feel your way out.
In addition to the general airline safety instructions, some other tips may
make you feel more secure.
A full bladder could burst upon sudden impact. So your seat belt should be
fastened low and tight on the hip bone, rather than across the stomach.
Do not cross your legs underneath the seat in front of you. If the aircraft
falls to earth in an aborted take-off, the seat of the person in front of
you could collapse and break your ankles.
The best brace position for emergency landings is to get down as low as you
can to protect yourself from fire flashes overhead. Bend over and put your
arms under your thighs. Grab your wrists under your legs and look downwards,
rather than towards the aisle or windows.
In an emergency, knowing how to leave the aircraft is crucial. In the
absence of suitable supervisors, if you are next to the over-wing exit take
charge of opening it. If the exit and the area outside are clear of flames,
face the rear of the aircraft and put the adjacent seat arm rests up.
Put your hand nearest the window on its lowest handle. Reach across your
chest with your other hand and pull down the handle at the top of the
window.
Pull the window on to your shoulder, rotate it on to the seat row you have
just cleared, and slide it six inches towards the aisle to give yourself and
other passengers more room to exit. If you are strong enough, pitch the
window out of the exit to create even more room.
To exit properly from the galley section of the aircraft, you need to know
the make of the aircraft. It is listed on the safety cards. On McDonnell
Douglas-made planes, turn the handles on the galley-side exit right to left.
With Boeing aircraft, it is left to right.
It is likely that if there is a crash, you will be battling against smoke on
your way out of the aircraft. Instead of standing up or crawling down the
aisle, bend at the waist and walk like Groucho Marx.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Management: . . . and still relevant from 1908
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A slim 64-page volume, written 85 years ago by a frustrated university don,
seems an unlikely text for modern managers.
That, though, is just how a tiny publishing house Mainsail Press has been
promoting its new hardback edition of Francis Macdonald Cornford's
Microcosmographia Academica, newly subtitled Cambridge's classic guide to
success in the world.*
In a forward penned in 1949 the classicist WKC Guthrie said that just before
the second world war he had 'tried the book on the head of an engineering
firm, and he assured me that the business world was in urgent need of its
counsel'.
The enterprising Mainsail has gone even further, soliciting from BT's head
of strategy development the generous plug on its back cover that 'every
young MBA in a hurry' should read it.
This is perhaps going a bit far. But it is not an exaggeration to say that
many of Cornford's pithy, if somewhat cynical, observations have stood the
test of time.
The words of Cambridge's first professor of ancient philosophy - inspired by
his experience of the tortuous ways in which academic bodies reach (or avoid
reaching) decisions - were originally directed at ambitious young academics.
Today one could imagine him addressing business graduates about to embark on
a career in a large organisation.
Disillusioned by those who sought to avert change, Cornford's ideas were
intended as a warning for those who fail to understand human nature and, as
he saw it, man's inbuilt inertia. 'There is only one argument for doing
something; the rest are arguments for doing nothing', he wrote.
Among the principles of practical politics he explores are those of the
wedge (that 'you should not act justly now for fear of raising expectations
which you are afraid you will not have the courage to satisfy'); the
dangerous precedent (from which 'it follows that nothing should ever be done
for the first time'); and unripe time ('Time, by the way, is like the
medlar; it has a trick of going rotten before it is ripe').
Cornford also recommends for delaying action 'another sport which wastes
unlimited time', namely comma-hunting: 'Once start a comma and the whole
pack will be off, full cry, especially if they have had a literary
training'.
More constructively perhaps - but just as Machiavellian - is the passage on
squaring, which might be interpreted today as I'll scratch your back, if
you'll scratch mine, while not formally admitting that this is the case.
Cornford says that the practice of squaring can be carried out over lunch,
but that the 'proper course' in his day was to meet 'accidentally' between
2pm and 4pm on King's Parade, Cambridge, 'talk about indifferent matters for
ten minutes', and then observe a procedure which emphasises 'the fact that
there is no connection whatsoever between my supporting your job and your
supporting mine. This absence of connection is the essential feature of
squaring'.
The most famous passage in the book is probably the definition of propaganda
in Cornford's preface to the 1922 edition. It is 'that branch of lying which
consists in very nearly deceiving your friends without quite deceiving your
enemies'.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Management: Just as timely 25 years on . . . - George
Prince, retired co-founder of US consultancy Synectics, on running better
meetings / Tips From The Top
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE PRINCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I was delighted when I recently discovered that my article 'How to be a
better chairman' was the only article surviving from the 1960s in the
Harvard Business Review's selection of 'the Best of Best'. Based on the
frequency and size of demand, its inclusion shows just how important and
difficult a part of our lives meetings continue to be.
During the past quarter century there have been many changes, large and
small, in the ways we speak and think. Nowadays we are no longer allowed to
talk about 'chairmen' but have to talk about 'chairpersons'. If l were to
write my article now, I might abolish the whole concept of 'chair' and use
the term 'process leader'.
What follows is the essence of my 25-year-old article. I've shortened it
considerably, but the message is the same: it is possible to run more
productive meetings if the person in the chair understands the group
dynamics and knows clearly what skills a leader needs.
Many people are cynical about the time spent in meetings. Often they fail,
though, because of hidden agendas, lack of candour and waste of talent. On
the basis of thousands of meetings observed over the years, I have found
that even mild rejection has a significantly negative effect on people;
pointing out flaws in others' ideas occupies too much time; while approval
has a positive effect and creates a climate for resolution of the problem.
Successful meetings take place in an atmosphere in which participants need
not defend themselves or their ideas. When relieved from the burden of self
protection everybody can wholeheartedly devote themselves to the meeting. To
draw creative contributions from everyone in the group, a chairperson must
use his or her wits, plenty of tact, and some new rules of order.
The process of running a meeting could go like this. Having briefly
headlined the problem, preferably in the format of 'How to ..?' or 'How can
I ..?', the chair should ask the member with most knowledge of and
involvement in the problem to explain it in more detail. Meanwhile,
participants listen and make notes about associations, ideas, and new
perspectives.
The chair then encourages participants to be as wishful about the solving of
the problem as they can. All wishes will be recorded on a flip chart for all
to see. It has been found that the wilder the wish, the more likely it is to
evoke a starting point for possible solutions.
When people offer their ideas, the chair has to protect them from all
attacks. He/she needs to force members see positive value in each idea.
'What do you like about A's suggestion?' the chair can ask. Only after
making notes on several valuable aspects of it, can the concerns be brought
up. By recognising everybody's views, the chair keeps the climate
non-aggressive and people more willing to contribute.
In order to increase the probability of finding a novel approach, the chair
can apply a technique that is considered outrageous by many, creating an
artificial, instant 'excursion' from the problem.
He/she instructs: 'Please put the problem out of your mind. Now, can anyone
think of a striking image in the world of weather?' Members begin to offer
examples, and the chair records them all. They select one and discuss its
implications. The 'excursion' time can last from 5 to 15 minutes depending
on the members' skill in keeping off the original problem.
Using the 'excursion' material, the chair asks the members to connect it
back to the original problem. These connections are usually unthought of and
highly speculative. Exciting new ideas are then developed, all members
adding to and building upon each other's suggestions until it reflects the
constructive energies of the group.
In summary, the 10 leadership principles for the role of chairperson are:
1. Never compete with the group members. Give members' ideas precedence over
your own.
2. Listen to every group member. Paraphrase, do not judge.
3. Don't permit anyone to be put on the defensive. Assume value in all
ideas.
4. Use every member of the group. Control the dominating ones without
alienating them.
5. Keep the energy levels high. Your own interest and alertness are
contagious.
6. Keep members informed about where they are and what is expected of them.
Keep notes on flip charts for all to see.
7. Keep your eye on the expert (the problem owner). Check with him/her
whether an idea is worth pursuing further and when a proposed solution is
satisfactory.
8. Rotate turns in the managing of meetings. To learn to lead is to learn
how to participate, and when the chair rotates, everyone learns.
9. Do not manipulate the group.
10. Work hard at the technique of chairing a meeting.
Tips from the Top will be on holiday until January 10.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Management: Keep it quiet and healthy at work - Deafness as
a work-related disease / Health Check
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROL COOPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Those who think deafness is mainly a question of old age may be in for a
surprise. Noise at work is the leading cause of hearing loss in the
industrialised world, with 1.7m people in Britain estimated by the Health &amp;
Safety Executive to be suffering from work-related deafness.
Hearing loss has long been known to follow loud blasts on the battlefield,
and industrial deafness goes back more than two centuries. So-called
boilermaker's deafness was commonplace in the 1890s - with today's wider
range of noisy machinery, hearing loss affects many more workers.
Noise-induced problems may not be new, but there is now greater interest in
occupational health as well as growing disquiet over leisure noise.
Loud noise affects the inner ear; it damages the hair cells of the cochlea,
which translates the vibration of sound waves into electrical impulses. The
first symptom of damage is often tinnitus (ringing in the ears). Its
severity is a guide to the risk of incipient deafness.
When hearing loss sets in, it may be reversible at first - as after a rock
concert - but later it becomes permanent. An early complaint is muffled
hearing, or difficulty on the telephone or in the pub. High-pitched sounds
can be especially hard to distinguish.
The risk of deafness is related to noise levels which are measured in
decibels (dB), usually on the A scale which compensates for the fact that
human hearing is more acute for high-pitched sounds. The decibel scale is
logarithmic, so the difference between 90dB and 100dB is a ten-fold increase
in sound energy.
Levels of 80dB are roughly those you would find in a busy street and pose no
significant risk to hearing. But around 2.4m UK workers, according to the
HSE, are exposed to levels above this. Occupational deafness is a prescribed
industrial disease, and an employee may successfully claim compensation from
his employer if hearing loss is work-related.
Under the 1989 Noise at Work Regulations, employers have a general duty to
reduce noise to the lowest levels practicable, and a specific duty to take
action where levels are too high.
Where the daily exposure of an employee is likely to be 85dB, information
about the dangers must be given, along with instruction on minimising risks.
Ear protectors (muffs or plugs) should be provided to all employees on
request, and - very importantly - maintained in working condition. At 90dB,
employers must ensure that ear protectors are worn, and that ear protection
zones are marked if at all possible. Everyone entering the zone, however
briefly, should protect their ears.
Ear protectors don't entirely cut out noise and are not always worn. Some
workers claim they hinder communication with colleagues or prevent them from
hearing warning sirens (this seems unlikely). Dirty protectors can cause ear
infections, but even when clean they are often considered uncomfortable,
inconvenient, or wimpish. Nonetheless at 90dB the employer is responsible.
Only accurate technical measurements can determine how noisy an environment
is, but as a rough guide, if people must shout to be heard two metres away,
or their ears ring after work, noise is excessive. Factories are not the
only places affected - many offices and farms are noisy too.
Since the risks of noise are cumulative, hours of work and length of service
are relevant, as are leisure pursuits.
The effects of loud noise go well beyond the ear. Aggression, poor
concentration, learning difficulties, and feelings of hopelessness have all
been described.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Lib Dems under attack over racism inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liberal Democrat leadership was last night besieged by complaints from
the Labour party - and its own councillors in the London borough of Tower
Hamlets - that it had mishandled allegations of racism against its members.
The Liberal Democrats published an inquiry into racism in the borough last
week but Ms Gwynneth Deakins, who chairs Tower Hamlets' Liberal Democrat
group, said that two party councillors had quit 'in disgust' at the weekend
and a third councillor, who was severely censured in the report, would
'fight to clear his name'.
Mr Peter Hughes, leader of the majority Liberal Democrats on the council,
last night issued a statement which strongly criticised the national
leadership and said: 'If any group members resign from the party we would
continue as a single group and maintain the administration of the council.'
A meeting of local Liberal Democrats last night moved to set up a breakaway
group, Liberal Focus.
Mr Jack Straw, Labour's environment spokesman, yesterday pressed home his
claim that the inquiry had censured the party leadership for 'incompetence
or worse'.
Mr Charles Kennedy, president of the party, said the matter had been
investigated thoroughly following the Tower Hamlets by-election which
resulted in the far-right British National party winning a seat. He told BBC
1's Breakfast with Frost programme: 'We have been accused of circulating
racist literature. We set up an inquiry. It reported, we published it in
full and we are taking action.'
He accused Labour leaders of covering up an inquiry into their party's
conduct in the September council election. 'Jack Straw, who is accusing us
of not having dealt with this properly, knows that Labour has had an
internal inquiry,' he said. 'They are not publishing it and we don't know if
they are taking any action.'
Mr Straw highlighted a section of the Liberal Democrats' report that accused
Mr Graham Elson, the party's general-secretary, of 'failing in his duty'
when he was checking the distribution of allegedly racist pamphlets at a
by-election this year.
Liberal Democrat leaders were reported to be furious that Mr Straw had
requested Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, to refer the allegations
against Liberal Democrat councillors to the Metropolitan police on the
grounds of incitement to racism.
Scotland Yard said on Friday night that the attorney-general had referred
the matter to it. The Liberal Democrat leadership said the referral was 'of
a standard nature in response to any such approach from an MP'.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Housing at top of spending league: In spite of Tory pledges,
the quango seems a more voracious beast than ever
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Housing Corporation, which distributes government grants to housing
associations in England, is the biggest spender in this year's FT top 40
list of quangos - quasi-autonomous non-governmental bodies, whose power and
influence the government is pledged to curb.
The corporation, at Pounds 2.3bn, has risen from 10th place in last year's
list following the boost given to its budget to buy unsold homes as part of
the housing market package in the autumn statement last year.
New entrants this year include English Heritage, the quango which looks
after historical buildings and monuments, and English Estates, which builds
business premises in depressed areas.
Just four of the top 40 quangos are chaired by women, in spite of the
government's drive to increase the number of women appointed to public
posts. Women hold 28 per cent of places on quango boards.
Businessmen, current and retired, continue to dominate as chairmen of the
top 40. In the list for the first time this year are Sir Martin Jacomb,
chairman of the British Council and former deputy chairman of Barclays Bank,
and Sir Anthony Cleaver, who chairs IBM UK as well as the UK Atomic Energy
Authority.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Accounts plan 'will reform Whitehall'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Changes to public-sector accounting practices in last month's Budget may be
one of the government's most important Whitehall management reforms, the
Social Market Foundation says today.
The foundation, an independent think-tank, says that insufficient attention
has been given to a Budget comment by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor,
calling for a move to 'resource accounting'.
At present most public-sector organisations formally account for the flow of
cash for their regular operations. But there is little accounting of the use
of capital to meet the costs of maintaining resources such as land,
buildings and large equipment, or of the extent to which these items might
have depreciated.
Mr Evan Davis, the report's author, says the introduction of such accounting
in the public sector would rank alongside market testing, the introduction
of executive agencies and the private finance initiative in its impact on
the restructuring of Whitehall. He says that the move would make it easier
to reveal the full costs of delivering services. The cost of a capital item
would not, for example, be carried on the day it was bought, but would be
spread through accounts as though the item were leased.
Another consequence would be to encourage the private sector to compete for
the provision of public services.
Mr Davis says that the private sector cannot easily compete in the provision
of capital goods to the state because Whitehall disburses grants for capital
in a broadly discretionary way.
But he says that the introduction of resource accounting would 'sort out the
problem of capital so that it does not have to be given out free of charge
in big occasional blocks to lucky recipients'.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Lib Dems hit back at race claims by Straw
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liberal Democratic party yesterday hit back at claims by a Labour MP
that its leadership had been incompetent when handling allegations of racism
among its members in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets.
Mr Charles Kennedy, president of the Liberal Democrats, tried to stem
repeated accusations from Mr Jack Straw, Labour's environment spokesman,
following publication of an inquiry's findings last week.
Mr Straw said the official inquiry, which was conducted by the Liberal
Democrats themselves, revealed 'incompetence or worse' on the part of the
party leadership.
He highlighted a section of the report that accused Mr Graham Elson, the
party's general-secretary, of 'failing in his duty' following the
distribution of allegedly racist pamphlets at a by-election this year.
Yesterday Mr Kennedy did not deny the allegations in the report, but said
that the party had investigated the matter thoroughly following the Tower
Hamlets by-election, which resulted in the far-right British National Party
winning a seat.
He told BBC1's Breakfast with Frost programme: 'We have been accused of
circulating racist literature. We set up an inquiry. It reported, we
published it in full and we are taking action.'
He accused Labour leaders of covering up an inquiry into their own party's
conduct in the September council election. 'Jack Straw, who is accusing us
of not having dealt with this properly, knows that Labour has had an
internal inquiry,' said Mr Kennedy. 'They are not publishing it and we don't
know if they are taking any action.'
He added: 'We gather that Labour has looked at its own processes. Why
doesn't Labour come up-front and say what its findings are?'
However, Liberal Democrat leaders were reported to be furious that Mr Straw
had also persuaded Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, to refer the
allegations against Liberal Democrat councillors to the Metropolitan Police
on the grounds of incitement to racism.
On Friday night Scotland Yard said that the attorney-general had referred
the matter to it, but made no further comment. The Liberal Democrat
leadership claims that the referral is 'of a standard nature in response to
any such approach from an MP'.
The Liberal Democrats said Mr Straw's complaint was passed to the police as
a courtesy and without Sir Nicholas taking a view.
Mr Straw has also sent a letter to Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat
leader, demanding to know why he has remained 'uncharacteristically silent'
over the issue.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Names to be given 10-year help on losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Names on the Lloyd's of London insurance market facing substantial losses
may soon be extended a long-term lifeline to help them meet the crippling
demands on their assets, it emerged yesterday.
Mr Ken Randall, chief executive of Randall Group, the insurance adviser,
said that he was close to announcing details of a financing package that
would allow repayment of losses over 10 years by Names - the individuals
whose assets have traditionally supported the market.
The service is one of a number of initiatives being planned by Randall Group
following the announcement yesterday that it had sold a substantial minority
stake to JO Hambro Magan, the merchant bank.
Mr Randall said he had obtained the support of one US and several UK banks
towards raising on the Euro-markets at least 'a few hundreds of millions'
and possibly more than a billion pounds, which would be used to pay cash
calls levied on Names.
The package would be structured so that Names would pay only interest on
their loans for the first three years, then equal-sized instalments of the
capital over seven to 10 years.
The announcement could provide welcome relief to many Names considering
whether to accept a Pounds 900m out-of-court legal settlement with Lloyd's
or pursue litigation.
The latest estimates from Chatset, the research group, suggest that Names
could face demands for Pounds 8.65bn over the next 20 years.
Mr Randall said he had been working on the idea over a number of weeks and
had held detailed discussions 'at a very high level' in Lloyd's. He said he
was close to resolving a number of 'technical hurdles'.
He said that the idea had already been tested, and final arrangements were
being made. Names would be approved for the scheme on a case-by-case basis.
The idea has been supported with help from Magan, which yesterday announced
that it had bought 49 per cent of the shares in Randall Group for an
undisclosed sum.
The group will in the future concentrate on three areas: insurance
consultancy and management, investment management of insurance funds, and
introductory and advisory services for investors in the London market.
Mr Randall, a former head of regulation at Lloyd's, refused to provide
details of the financial position of the company other than to say that its
annual turnover was several million pounds.

Attacks on the framework of the national curriculum are made today by
rightwing critics and a teachers' union.
The Centre for Policy Studies warns that schools forced to work to a
detailed national curriculum will be put in a 'straitjacket of dull
mediocrity'. The opposition comes as Mr John Patten, education secretary, is
due to receive the final report on the curriculum review by Sir Ron Dearing,
chairman of the Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Businesses should target high-growth markets outside Europe to help close
Britain's trade gap, according to Mr David Kern, chief economist at National
Westminster Bank.
Mr Kern said that focusing on Asia, Latin America and North America, was
vital over the next few years if Britain was to win a larger share of world
exports.
In NatWest's latest Economic and Financial Outlook he said that the newly
industrialised economies in Asia accounted for 11.4 per cent of world
imports but took just 4.7 per cent of UK exports.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Conflict looms on councils revamp
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir John Banham, chairman of the Local Government Commission, is expected to
provoke further conflict with the Department of the Environment when final
proposals for restructuring councils in Avon, Gloucestershire and Somerset
are announced today.
Sir John is expected to reverse a provisional plan to split Gloucestershire
into unitary authorities, in favour of keeping the status quo of two-tier
district and county councils.
Since his first proposals were announced, however, Mr John Gummer, the
environment secretary, has issued new guidance for the commission which
makes clear that the government does not expect the status quo to be
maintained.

<TEXT>
The Department of Transport is attempting to block European Union inspired
reviews of the environmental impact of large road and rail schemes,
according to a leaked letter from Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, to
Mr Tim Yeo, environment minister, Charles Batchelor writes.
Friends of the Earth, the environmental group, which has obtained a copy of
the letter, said last night it would take High Court action against the
government if Mr MacGregor succeeded in blocking the environmental reviews.
The Department of Transport said it could not comment.
In the letter Mr MacGregor says he has 'clear legal advice' that there is no
need for reviews of projects already under construction.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Ex-BCCI staff sued by Abu Dhabi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government of Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder of the collapsed Bank
of Credit and Commerce International, will today launch civil action against
13 former executives in the bank for up to Dollars 9bn, Andrew Jack writes.
The proceedings, which will be given a preliminary hearing in the Abu Dhabi
courts on Christmas Day, follow the commencement of criminal action against
executives including Mr Hasan Abedi, founder of the bank now living in
Pakistan, Mr Swaleh Naqvi, chief operating officer, Mr Hassan Kazmi, general
manager of ICI in the Caymans, and Mr Ziauddin Akbar, who was recently
jailed in London.
The action alleges that more than Dollars 2.2bn in 'portfolio' funds
provided by Sheikh Zayed and Crown Prince Khalifa was channelled into ICIC,
controlled by BCCI in the Caymans, and used to prop up fictitious and
non-performing loans and operating losses.
The balance of the funds in the action includes money invested and shares
bought in BCCI by Adia, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.
Mr David Sandy, a partner with Simmons &amp; Simmons, the lawyer hired by Abu
Dhabi, said a case had also been prepared to bring action against the
executives and the BCCI companies in the English courts, which could
threaten recoveries from the banks hundreds of thousands of other creditors
around the world.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Fear of redundancy surges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of workers who fear they might lose their jobs in the next 12
months rose to more than 50 per cent in December - in spite of last week's
sharp fall in unemployment - the latest MORI/IRS survey for the Financial
Times shows.
It is only the third time since the monthly surveys started last April that
the fear factor has risen over 50 per cent, and the finding suggests that
the Budget last month has had a negative impact on perceptions of job
security.
Fifty-one per cent of the 982 people interviewed said they were very or
fairly concerned about being made redundant.
Part-time women workers are taking most of the jobs being created but this
group has seen the biggest rise in job fears. Anxiety among part-time
workers, who are overwhelmingly women, rose from 35 per cent in November to
49 per cent. Among women in general the figure rose from 43 per cent to 49
per cent.
The anxiety ratio also rose sharply among white-collar and lower managerial
staff, from 44 per cent in November to 52 per cent, possibly reflecting the
likelihood of more public-services job cuts . Anxiety also rose from 35 per
cent to 40 per cent among professional and senior managerial workers. The
age group with the biggest increase was 55-plus, which rose from 32 per cent
to 41 per cent. Anxiety in the Midlands fell slightly but it rose in both
the north of England and the south.
Mr John Prescott, the shadow employment spokesman, said the survey showed
that unemployment figures could fall without bringing any increase in
confidence. He said: 'This survey, like several other indices, seems to be
at odds with what is happening to the official unemployment figures, which
makes one rather suspicious of those figures.'

FT  20 DEC 93 / IRA prisoners hold a key to peace progress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the IRA and its political wing, Sinn Fein, deliberate their response to
last week's peace initiative by the British and Irish governments, the 700
IRA prisoners held in jails around the world are likely to play a pivotal
role in the acceptance or rejection of the initiative by the republican
movement.
The fact that the republican movement refers to them as 'prisoners of war'
is indicative of the important role Sinn Fein and the IRA expect their
release to play in any peace settlement. If the 'war' is declared over, then
the logic from their perspective is that all prisoners captured in that
'war' should be released.
A Sinn Fein spokesman said at the weekend: 'Prisoners are obviously one of
the issues that would have to be addressed if there is to be a meaningful
peace process.' He added that the issue of loyalist prisoners - of whom
there also 700, mainly in Ulster jails - would be of equal importance to the
loyalist paramilitary groups.
Mr Danny Morrison, a former publicity officer for Sinn Fein who is serving
an eight-year sentence for unlawful imprisonment, is one of the key figures
in the prisons directly responsible for organising debates and discussions
among IRA prisoners on the peace initiative. In his column published in
Republican News, the nationalist newspaper, he has also been one of the
leading advocates over the past two years of a peace process and of reaching
an accommodation with the unionists.
Mr John Major, the British prime minister, said last week that there would
be no amnesty for paramilitary prisoners. This does not, however, rule out a
case-by-case review and the possibility of remission being granted by the
attorney-general.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said he believed that the
issue of the prisoners in the UK and the republic would be approached 'with
flexibility'. He said that the first Anglo-Irish joint Brussels statement in
October, which refers to 'doors being opened' in the event of a cessation of
violence, implies that the issue of prisoners will be addressed.
Most IRA prisoners are serving sentences of 15 years or more, according to
Sinn Fein. A total of 90 of the 700 are serving life sentences, mostly for
murder. Many of the rest are serving sentences for possession of firearms or
explosives. In Northern Ireland someone with a firearm is likely to be
charged with 'possession with intent', which carries a much heavier sentence
than 'possession' alone.
Of the 700, 350 are held in the high-security Maze/Long Kesh prison in
Northern Ireland. A further 260 are held in other prisons in the province,
some of these being prisoners on remand.
About 55 prisoners are held in Portlaoise prison in the Republic of Ireland
and a further 30 are held in mainland Britain. Twelve are imprisoned in the
US and continental Europe.
In the republic four prisoners are serving the maximum sentence of 40 years,
an uncommutable sentence except through presidential intervention.
This week 440 prisoners from Northern Ireland's jails will be given a seven
 -day Christmas release on parole. Significantly, 95 will be prisoners
serving life sentences for 'terrorist-related offences', according to the
Northern Ireland Office. Sinn Fein said that about 60 would be from the IRA.
Mr Richard McAuley, a Sinn Fein spokesman, said: 'Those in prison would not
have a veto over the people on the outside. 'At this stage though, we are
all moving on the same track.'

FT  20 DEC 93 / This is Christmas, season of turnover: Lisa Wood joins in
the seasonal rush at southern England's largest shopping centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first telephone call from a customer to the Thurrock Lakeside Shopping
Centre in Essex yesterday came at 3.15am. 'What time do you open?' asked an
anxious male voice.
Throughout the rest of yesterday caller after caller asked the same question
of the 24-hour operations room in what is the largest shopping centre in the
south of England.
Mrs Muriel Taylor repeated with infinite patience: '10am until 6pm - No, I'm
afraid Marks and Spencer is closed on a Sunday.'
The centre, whose 52 metre glass dome rises over the countryside near
Dagenham in east London, has been open for three previous Christmases.
Lessons have been learned with each festive rush. Yesterday, the last Sunday
before Christmas, everything looked neat as more than 30,000 cars disgorged
their occupants.
Mr Chris Fear, operations manager at Lakeside, developed by Capital &amp;
Counties at a cost of Pounds 350m, said the Christmas operation had become
more efficient every year. 'We really start to lay out our plans for
Christmas in late January and early February, when managers produce
assessments of how the previous Christmas period progressed and any
opportunities we may have missed.
'We learn a lot. The second Christmas we had substantial traffic jams. So we
built 3,000 car parking spaces, taking the total to 12,000, with a new
control team. The centre has more car parking spaces than any town in
Essex.'
The centre employs about 200 maintenance, cleaning and security staff - the
last monitoring more than 100 closed-circuit television. Mr Fear said no
extra staff were taken on at Christmas. 'Floors need cleaning whether 10
feet or 100 feet have walked over them.'
But the workload is much higher at this time of the year. Saturday night
cleaning staff dispose of about 10 tonnes of waste - much of it the packing
cases from Saturday's deliveries. In a normal week the centre generates
about 20 tonnes.
Mr Fear said: 'It's more people to look after, more rubbish to dispose of
and more problems to deal with. But it's routine - the problem is trying to
keep the standard of service.'
Mr Fear spent much of yesterday patrolling the 1.3m sq ft of retail space
where many of the crowds appeared to be spending a day by window shopping.
Most of the shops opened at 10am yesterday but the centre opens at 7.30am
and the management company encourages caterers to open early for early
birds.
The patisserie opened at 8.15am yesterday and had done more than Pounds 600
of business by 10am.
Ms Tracey Horton-Reeve, the manager, said: 'It's hectic despite the extra
staff we've taken on. But it's worth it. What we can make, particularly on a
Saturday at this time of the year, may be the equivalent of a week's takings
at the end of January.'
She said consumer demand was not always predictable. 'Last year we did a lot
of mince pies but we couldn't give them away. This year scones and sausage
rolls are the favourites.'

FT  20 DEC 93 / TUC aims to cut jobs in radical relaunch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Trades Union Congress will today unveil a proposal to revolutionise the
internal workings of the TUC as part of a 'relaunch' of the organisation
involving job cuts and scrapping committees.
The relaunch planned for next March, is likely to distance it further from
the Labour party and to stress the TUC's role as a hard-nosed lobbying group
on work-related issues.
TUC officials admit that its membership total is likely to be hit hard by
government-imposed reforms later this year to the 'check-off' system of
paying union dues.
Part of the internal reform, which will be presented today to the TUC's
Finance and General Purposes Committee, involves abolishing a large number
of the TUC's 25 committees, most of which are poorly attended and soak up
resources to little effect.
Some of the main General Council committees will probably stay but the seven
industry committees are likely to be axed. Any spare resources will be
transferred to the lobbying and campaigning unit.
The organisation has little choice but to slim down. Its current income of
Pounds 10m, based on the Pounds 1.40 a year paid on behalf of 7m
TUC-affiliated union members, pays for nearly 200 employees at Congress
House, in the regions and in its education arm, but is set for steady
decline.
Officials admit that the real membership of TUC unions is has already nearer
to 6m than the 7m-plus the organisation quotes, with no levelling-off in
sight. They expect to lose another 10 per cent as a result of the move to
make the 80 per cent who pay union dues by automatic check-off renew their
consent to the system before next August.
Another financial blow is the removal of government support from some
aspects of trade union education, which together with falling income from
affiliated unions could mean a further round of job cuts at the TUC after
last year's belated 20 per cent cut.
Despite this gloomy financial backdrop to the relaunch, Mr John Monks - who
yesterday celebrated his 100th day as TUC general-secretary - is widely
considered to have made an impressive start to his leadership. He is
becoming an impressive media performer, highlighting the growth of
employment insecurity and its possible role in undermining family values.
Mr Monks has a friendly relationship with Mr David Hunt, the employment
secretary, who is keen to give the TUC a constructive role in some areas of
public policy, especially training. Mr Hunt also wants to see union
representatives on all Training and Enterprise Councils.
However, the relaunch could be dogged by two reminders of a more traditional
kind of trade unionism - a long-standing inter-union wrangle in the
construction industry, and a planned one-day public-sector 'general strike'
in April.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Jaguar boosts output by 43%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jaguar has increased output by 43 per cent this year to about 29,500 cars
from last year's 20,593. The 1992 figure was the lowest for 11 years.
Following the cut of about 45 per cent in its UK workforce in 1991 and last
year the fortunes of Jaguar, a subsidiary of Ford of the US, have improved
markedly. Its UK workforce has been virtually unchanged at about 6,450.
In contrast to much of the European car industry it has avoided short-time
working this year and since August it has had significant overtime at its
Coventry plants.
Its worldwide retail sales have risen by about 24 per cent this year to
between 27,500 and 28,000 from 22,475 last year, largely due to a rising US
demand.
Jaguar more than doubled its sales in the US in November to 1,356 from 616
in the same month a year ago, with about 70 per cent of its US business now
based on leasing. The US is Jaguar's single most important market worldwide
and its sales there increased 49 per cent in the first 11 months of the year
to 11,358.
The luxury carmaker has been in loss for five years in succession from 1989
to 1993, but the losses have been reduced significantly in recent months.
Its operating losses in the first nine months of the year fell to Dollars
226m (Pounds 151.6m) from Dollars 300m in the same period a year earlier.
Losses in the third quarter were reduced to Dollars 108m from Dollars 135m,
but the third-quarter loss this year included a one-off charge of Dollars
65m for the closure of Venture Pressings, its joint venture with GKN.
Jaguar is being increasingly integrated into Ford's European operations and
next year production of the stamped body panels for Jaguar cars will be
transferred from Venture Pressings to the Ford plant at Halewood,
Merseyside, which has spare capacity.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Stores Christmas performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The quoted retail groups are being even more secretive than usual about
their Christmas performance according to Mr John Richards, stores analyst at
NatWest Markets, as the slightest hint of weakness can have a dramatic
effect on their share price, Neil Buckley writes.
'But there has been no evidence of any major retailer having any distress
sales or special unplanned promotions,' Mr Richards said - in sharp contrast
to the situation two years ago.
Signet, the jewellery group which changed its name from Ratners this year,
has in the past made up to 90 per cent of its annual profits in the
Christmas trading period. Woolworths makes virtually its entire annual
profit between October and January. Boots makes about half its profits in
the Christmas period and WH Smith about one-third. For most non-food
retailers except the DIY chains a good Christmas is the key to a good year.
John Lewis Partnership, virtually the only large retailer to publish sales
comparisons, said that while sales in the first week of December topped its
estimate, at 4.1 per cent higher than last year, 'the rate of advance was
somewhat below that to which we have become accustomed'.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Environment shake-up call
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's creation of a new Environment Agency should be taken as a
chance to shake up British environmental regulation, says Mr Dieter Helm,
director of forecasting group Oxera.
In a paper to be published tomorrow he says recent controversial decisions,
such as licensing the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant and extending the M4
through Twyford Down - have failed to weigh up costs and benefits.
Mr Helm calls for the proposed agency, which will unite the regulatory
functions of the National Rivers Authority and the Pollution Inspectorate,
to be independent from Treasury interference so that it can encourage the
development of market-based instruments to control pollution, such as taxes
and pollution permits.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Curriculum under further attack
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Attacks on the framework of the national curriculum are made today by
rightwing critics and a leading teachers' union.
The Centre for Policy Studies warns that schools forced to work to a
detailed national curriculum will be put in a 'straitjacket of dull
mediocrity'.
Their opposition comes on the day Mr John Patten, the education secretary,
is due to receive the final report on the curriculum review by Sir Ron
Dearing, chairman of the Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority.
Rightwing educationalists and teachers' unions believe that Sir Ron has not
gone far enough in allowing schools extra discretion over what is taught in
classrooms.
The Association of Teachers and Lecturers says the national curriculum
should not be allowed to take up more than 70 per cent of teaching time for
any pupils up to the age of 14, at which point it should be scrapped. Sir
Ron's provisional recommendations, announced in August, would devote between
75 per cent and 90 per cent of teaching time to the curriculum.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Fresh row in councils project
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir John Banham, chairman of the Local Government Commission, is expected to
provoke further conflict with the Department of the Environment when final
proposals for restructuring councils in Avon, Gloucestershire and Somerset
are announced today.
Sir John is expected to reverse a provisional plan announced earlier this
year to split Gloucestershire into all-purpose unitary authorities, in
favour of a plan to keep the status quo of two-tier district and county
councils.
Since his first proposals were announced, however, Mr John Gummer, the
environment secretary, has announced new guidance for the commission which
makes clear that the government does not expect the status quo to be
maintained. The department prefers unitary authorities.
Polls conducted for the commission by MORI show 62 per cent of residents in
Somerset and South Avon favour some form of unitary councils in principle,
while 59 per cent are in favour in Gloucestershire and North Avon.
In Gloucestershire, however, the status quo option is favoured by 42 per
cent, while the single most popular unitary option, which would split the
county into five authorities, is favoured by 16 per cent. The commission is
required to heed local preferences.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Lift maker hopeful of take-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Otis, the world's largest lift manufacturer, is hoping to expand its share
of the UK market through a new British-designed range of standard lifts,
Andrew Baxter writes.
The US-owned group unveiled the range - which cost Pounds 70m to develop -
last week in a move that is likely to intensify competitive pressure in the
UK lift market.
Mr John Leingang, chief executive of Otis in the UK, said the new range
could significantly increase its share of the market for 'model' or standard
lifts.
He said the UK lift industry had been badly hit by the construction industry
recession and the market for model lifts - used in everything from social
housing to low-rise offices - had been flat for 12 to 18 months.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Security alert disrupts London trains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Several main-line stations in London were closed yesterday and services in
Kent were disrupted after a security alert, Conner Middelmann writes.
Investigations centred on the line to London from Sevenoaks, but nothing was
found in searches lasting most of the day.
The stations reopened in the afternoon but Network SouthEast said it was too
early to say whether service would be back to normal for this morning's rush
hour.
'We would advise people to listen in to their local radio stations to find
out what the latest situation is,' a spokesman said.
Network SouthEast said a caller using a recognised IRA code word telephoned
at about 4.30am yesterday, prompting the closure of dozens of stations in
the the south-eastern division. Buses were used to ferry passengers from
outlying stations to central London.
A bomb exploded on a Network SouthEast line near Woking, Surrey, last
Tuesday, and two unexploded devices were found at nearby Brookwood station
on Thursday.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Employers upbeat on jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employers, particularly in the building industry, are more optimistic about
job creation than at any time since the first quarter of 1990, the Manpower
survey of employment prospects for the first quarter of 1994 shows.
The optimism of the first employment survey since the Budget - based on
responses from 2,000 employers - is at odds with continuing employee
pessimism about redundancy.
The survey shows 18 per cent of employers forecasting job increases and 21
per cent job losses, producing a net balance of minus three. That result is
significantly more optimistic than the balance of minus 16 in the first
quarter of this year.
Southern England and London appear to be experiencing the biggest
turnaround. In the first quarter of this year London had a negative balance
of minus 19, which is far worse than the national average, but it is now on
the national average at minus three.
The south is forecasting a positive balance of 11 compared with a negative
balance of 12 for the first quarter of 1993, a swing of 23 percentage
points.
Nine of 12 regions continue to be pessimistic, with north-west England one
of the most pessimistic on minus 20.
Manufacturing had a balance of plus five. The service sector has seen a
decline in confidence compared with the last quarter of last year and stands
at minus 8. The public sector is the most pessimistic on minus 12.
Banking has recovered to a negative balance of minus 4 compared with minus
36 for the first quarter of this year but energy and water remain
job-shedders with a negative balance of minus 24. The most optimistic sector
is private building, with a positive balance of 20.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Latin American cash flows slow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Capital inflows into Latin America slowed slightly this year but remain
significantly higher than at the beginning of the decade, the United Nations
Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean said yesterday.
According to the Santiago-based organisation, net capital inflows fell to
Dollars 54.6bn (Pounds 36.6bn) this year from Dollars 62.0bn in 1992, but
compared with Dollars 39.3bn in 1991. The net transfer of capital to the
region - which also takes account of interest and dividend payments abroad -
slipped below Dollars 26bn this year from Dollars 33bn last year.
The main beneficiaries were Mexico, where net inflows rose slightly to
Dollars 25.1bn from Dollars 24.7bn, and Argentina, where inflows dropped to
Dollars 10bn from Dollars 12.9bn. Inflows into Brazil dropped sharply to
Dollars 3.4bn from Dollars 8.8bn and into Venezuela to Dollars 1.32bn from
Dollars 2.33bn. Capital inflows fell slightly into Chile to Dollars 2.89bn
and into Peru to Dollars 2.86bn. Flows into Colombia rose from Dollars 167m
to Dollars 1.52bn.
The commission said capital continued to come from non-bank private sources,
noting that bond issues from the region reached Dollars 19.3bn this year.
Foreign direct investment was maintained at 'very high levels'. However, the
difference between interest rates in the US and in Latin America remained an
important factor in encouraging capital.
The capital inflows - along with fiscal balance, more stable prices and
growth - offered a virtuous circle which would generate confidence in the
permanence of economic policy, said Mr Gert Rosenthal, the head of the
commission. But he said worries remained about the size of the region's
current account deficit, up to Dollars 42.6bn this year from Dollars 36.9bn
in 1992.
Its preliminary assessment of the state of the Latin American economy showed
a continuation for the third successive year of moderate economic expansion:
3.2 per cent, implying per capita growth of 1.3 per cent. However, if Brazil
is excluded, regional growth dropped to 2.6 per cent from about 5 per cent
in 1992.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Contestants line up for Australian Treasury job: The rivals
to replace Dawkins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The king is dead, God save the king. Barely had John Dawkins, the Australian
treasurer, announced his intention to resign last Friday, than speculation
over his successor began. By the weekend's close, two names were at the
forefront of the running.
The first is Ralph Willis, the finance minister. The 55-year-old politician,
whose parliamentary career stretches back more than two decades and exceeds
even Mr Dawkins', has all the credentials. He has held his present job for
three years, and even took the treasurer's position for a brief period in
1991, during the final days of Mr Bob Hawke's administration. No one doubts
his technical expertise.
Moreover, Mr Willis was a research officer with the powerful Australian
Council of Trade Unions before entering parliament, and his appointment
would be unlikely to raise problems with the Labor party caucus. This may be
an important consideration: Mr Dawkins had been heavily attacked by both the
unions and the party's rank and file, who claimed that he cared more about
the nation's budget deficit than its double-digit unemployment rate.
But in contrast to the individualistic Mr Dawkins, Mr Willis is generally
viewed as a 'grey' politician, reliable but lacking in personal firepower.
Whether this will appeal to Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, is a moot
point.
The second favourite contender, Mr Laurie Brereton, presents very different
attributes. Unlike Mr Willis, Mr Brereton is viewed as one of Mr Keating's
closest personal allies. Both were born into working-class Catholic families
in Sydney and climbed the political ladder via the right-wing of the New
South Wales Labor party. They have been friends and political associates
since their teens. Mr Keating was best man at Mr Brereton's wedding.
But for most of his political life, Mr Brereton has played in the sometimes
murky world of state politics. He did not move into the federal sphere until
1990, and his Canberra career only began to advance when Mr Keating took
over from Mr Hawke.
After the last election, in March, Mr Brereton was made industrial relations
minister.
This was always going to be a tricky assignment. From the outset, Mr
Brereton's main task was to negotiate a labour market reform package which
was both acceptable to the unions and furthered the government's aim of
encouraging enterprise-based bargaining. After months of deadlock, a
compromise was duly hammered out - but not without intervention from Mr
Keating and, in the eyes of critics, some unfortunate concessions.
So, while Mr Brereton is long on connections and has reputation for
toughness, his credentials on the financial front are scant.
Given that neither of these men presents a perfect solution, there is no
shortage of other names being put forward. Already, Mr Kim Beazley, the
employment, education and training minister, has been tipped as a compromise
candidate, as has Mr Simon Crean, the primary industries minister. Outsiders
 -who might benefit if a broader government reshuffle takes place - include
Mr Michael Lee, the 36-year-old tourism minister.
But whoever takes over from Mr Dawkins will have little time to learn the
ropes, a fact which may weigh in the equation. The outgoing treasurer's
final act has been to reorganise the budget process so that finance bills
are presented in May and then passed by the end of June.
This earlier presentation, with its built-in negotiation period, is designed
to avert the embarrassing debacle which followed this summer's budget. Then,
the legislation was stalled in the senate for two months while minor parties
 -who hold the balance of power there - haggled over specific measures.
So, since the prime minister's office has made clear that no successor to Mr
Dawkins will be announced until early in the new year, this will give the
new treasurer just five months to learn his brief. Mr Dawkins, safe in
Fremantle, may look on with compassion.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Japanese banks' loan woes: 1980s 'bubble' has hit their
reserves, study shows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese banks are so underprovided against bad loans from the 'bubble
economy' of the late 1980s that they would be left only with 'hidden
reserves' of capital from holdings of securities if provisions were raised
to the right level, according to a study of the profitability of 300
international banks.
The study by the European bank ratings agency IBCA finds that the aftermath
of the late 1980s boom has left the Japanese banking system as the least
profitable in the world outside Nordic countries.
Akita, the most profitable Japanese bank, is only the 107th most profitable
in the world.
The study argues that Japanese banks remain 'substantially underprovided'
compared with banks in other big countries. It says that if they were
correctly reserved against poor loans, they would need to have 'accumulated
provisions of an amount equivalent to their current capital'.
However, it acknowledges that Japanese banks - unlike those in other
countries - can fall back on 'hidden reserves' of undervalued securities
holdings. It says their capacity to fund write-offs from these would be
'threatened if the Tokyo stock market went into free fall once again'.
The study, which calculates 'real profitability' for banks by applying a
common equity-to-assets ratio of 4 per cent and a common taxation rate of 50
per cent to each, finds that Banco Popular, the Spanish retail bank, is the
most profitable in the world for the third year in succession.
Banco Popular is followed by Bangkok Bank and Hang Seng Bank, reflecting the
high profits of banks in the Asia-Pacific region because of strong economic
growth and the lack of sophisticated capital markets.
US banks, which have recovered strongly from problems in the late 1980s,
also feature prominently, providing 11 of the 20 most profitable banks. The
US market is found to have the highest returns on equity, of 14.2 per cent,
compared with a return of 3 per cent in Japan.
British banks achieved a varied performance, with Barclays dropping to 285th
in the top 300 banks in terms of profitability from a peak of ninth in 1981,
and Bank of Scotland dropping to 128th from 2nd in that year.
However, Lloyds Bank has risen to 25th from 125th three years ago.
The most profitable British bank is HSBC Holdings, which is 16th most
profitable as well as 15th largest bank in terms of assets.
HSBC is the only one of the top 50 banks in terms of asset size to rank in
the 20 most profitable, and seven of the most profitable are among the
smallest 100.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Fox snaps up football from CBS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Rupert Murdoch's Fox Network has dropped a bomb on the US sports
television map with a Dollars 395m-a-year bid that has stripped American
football broadcasting rights away from the venerable CBS network.
Fox, still viewed as an upstart among the US television networks with
programming built around teenage soap operas and mildly salacious comedies,
offered Dollars 1.58bn (Pounds 1.06bn) over four years for the rights to
broadcast Sunday afternoon games from the National Football Conference, the
stronger of the two professional American football leagues.
The bid was 50 per cent higher than CBS paid for the last four years and is
believed to have been about Dollars 100m a year higher than CBS was willing
to pay.
CBS is now understood to have made an offer of more than Dollars 265m a year
for rights to broadcast games from the American Football Conference, the
weaker league, but NBC, which currently holds these rights, may match the
bid.
With ABC retaining the rights to a Monday night game for more than Dollars
225m a year, and the ESPN and Turner Network Television cable channels
paying about the same for a Sunday night game, the professional American
football leagues are expected to reap at least Dollars 4.3bn from television
over the next four years.
Although American football games are widely watched, advertising revenues
have not matched the high fees paid in recent years, although the games
provide an important lead into evening programming. CBS is estimated to have
lost around Dollars 100m on its NFC contract last year.
Mr Murdoch acknowledged Fox might lose money in the early years of the NFC
contract, but said he expected to make money eventually, adding that the
deal would make Fox into a real network.
Other television sports executives, however, believe Fox is certain to lose
heavily on the contract, and viewed the bid as a desperate attempt to
prevent some of Fox's 139 affiliated stations from defecting to other
networks.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
British companies will continue to lose out in competition for business in
China unless Hong Kong governor Chris Patten backs down and shelves his
democratic reforms, the governor of China's Guangdong province has said,
Reuter reports from Guangzhou.
'Patten terminated Sino-British talks by adamantly submitting his political
reform bill to the Legislative Council, so of course he has to be held
responsible,' Mr Zhu Shenlin told Hong Kong reporters on Saturday, in
comments similar to those he has made in the past.
'It needs the one who tied the bell to untie it.'
Mr Li Ziliu, Guangzhou's mayor, earlier said most British companies had been
excluded from an underground railway project in the town because of the row
over Hong Kong. His comments prompted British business officials to warn
that by proceeding with this stance China risked damaging its international
trading standing.
Meanwhile, a fresh row has emerged over a BBC documentary on the life of Mao
Tsetung which depicts the late chairman as having a taste for sex with young
girls.
The Chinese embassy accused the BBC of hostility to China and using
'despicable means to sling mud' at Mao. It said the BBC was 'fully aware of
the consequences' if it aired the programme as scheduled today.
China will borrow nearly Dollars 1.44bn for 17 big agricultural projects
during the next four years, the official China Daily Business Weekly said
yesterday. It said the long-term, low-interest loans would come from the
World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the Australian government.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Debts slow poor nations' recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Heavy debt repayments to the IMF and World Bank by the world's poorest
countries are holding up their recovery and the loans should be rescheduled
or written off, says a report published today.
The report, by the British charity Oxfam, calculates that debt repayments to
multilateral creditors by 19 'severely indebted, low-income countries' now
account for 30 per cent of their debt service payments, 'more than double
the level a decade ago'. Most of the countries are in Africa.
Payments to the IMF represent a 'special problem', according to the Oxfam
analysis, 'since they have outstripped the provision of new finance by some
Dollars 2bn since the mid-1980s'.
The report proposes a new issue of Special Drawing Rights by the Fund geared
specifically to debt reduction, and the sale of 10 per cent of the IMF's
gold stocks to finance a debt write-off for the world's poorest countries.
The paper takes Uganda as an example of the group's predicament. Scheduled
repayments on the country's debt for 1992-93 came to Dollars 173m (Pounds
116m), more than 80 per cent of export earnings. Actual repayments amounted
to less than half. Of these, about 50 per cent went to multilateral
creditors, mainly the IMF and the Bank.
By 1997, when repayments on a IMF structural adjustment loan fall due,
almost a third of Uganda's debt service commitments will be to the Fund.
The Oxfam paper also warns that Africa's overall debt crisis is deepening,
with the debt stock tripling over the past decade. The charity calls for the
immediate adoption of the Trinidad Terms, which allow for between 66 and 80
per cent write-off of Paris Club debt owed to official, bilateral creditors.
It blames 'resistance' by the Japanese government and general 'indifference'
among creditors for the delay in adopting the terms.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Israel, PLO end talks on deadlock: Dispute over Middle East
border controls unresolved in Norway discussions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israeli and Palestinian officials ended two days of closed-door talks in
Norway last night without any signs they had broken the deadlock over
implementation of the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord.
A draft statement issued by a Norwegian Foreign Ministry official, said:
'The two delegations went home for consultations and will meet again in the
next few days.'
The Norway talks were supposed to resolve differences between the two sides
which have held up phase one of implementation of the peace agreement: an
Israeli military withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and West Bank area of
Jericho.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, said before the end of the talks
in Norway that he would only attend a critical summit scheduled later this
week with Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, if
progress was made in Norway.
Cabinet ministers who met in Jerusalem stressed that the government was
united in refusing to make any compromise with the PLO over control of
borders - the issue at the hear of the disagreement between the two sides.
Officials said Israel wanted Mr Arafat to withdraw his demand for joint
control and joint patrols on the borders between the Gaza Strip and Egypt
and between the West Bank area of Jericho and Jordan.
In return Israel, would allow a substantial Palestinian presence at the
borders and would be more conciliatory on the other outstanding differences:
the size of the Jericho area and the role of the Israeli army in protecting
settlers who will continue to live in Gaza-Jericho. Officials say that
behind the differences is a misunderstanding between the two sides, with Mr
Arafat trying to win symbols of sovereignty from Israel in an effort to
portray the interim self-rule period as the embryo of a Palestinian state.
'There is a basic gap in positions,' Mr Benjamin Ben Eliezer, housing
minister, said. 'Yassir Arafat thinks that this is a process to establish a
Palestinian state. We are talking only about a transitional period of
autonomy to test whether co-existence is possible.'
The gap between the two sides appears not to have been bridged in Norway,
and the announcement that both sides were returning home for further
consultation before another round of talks was seen in Jerusalem as meaning
an inevitable further delay in the summit meeting.
Both sides fear that further delays will fuel spiralling Arab-Jewish
violence by extremists bent on sabotaging the peace agreement.
Officials said the decision to resume talks at a country mansion in
southeastern Norway, site of the secret talks which produced the
Israeli-Palestinian agreement last September, was taken as both sides
trusted the Norwegian brokers and had failed to make any progress in
bilateral talks.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Hanoi hardliners put reform process under threat: Iain
Simpson sees stumbling steps on the path towards a market economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAIN SIMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Vietnam begins to count the rising social cost of its gradual transition
to a market economy, there are renewed calls within the Communist party for
reform to slow.
At the current session of the Vietnamese National Assembly (parliament),
deputies - almost all of whom are also party members - are engaged in a
heated debate on the direction and speed of economic reforms.
For all the talk of reform and more openness in Vietnam, the assembly
session is strictly off-limits to outsiders. However, sources in the
assembly and other observers say the debate is focusing on the 'social
evils' of corruption, unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor
in Vietnam.
Deputies from the more conservative wing of the party argue that these
problems are a direct result of the country's gradual transition to a market
economy. They say the process must be slowed down so the government can
again take control over the economy and institute some kind of social
welfare for people who have suffered under the reforms.
Foreign observers say these arguments are gaining ground from the
reformists, who say social problems such as these are caused by the attempt
to straddle two economic systems. They say the sooner the government
abandons the remaining elements of a centrally planned system, the sooner it
will be able to deal with these problems.
None of the social problems being debated at the assembly is solely the
result of the government's reforms. However, many have appeared or got much
worse since they were introduced in 1986.
More than 2m people are jobless out of a working population of about 34m,
and at least 5m more are seriously underemployed.
This high rate is a result of both domestic and international changes. State
factories which have been forced to close because they cannot compete have
laid off tens of thousands of workers. Meanwhile, several hundred thousand
were put out of work when the army withdrew from Cambodia in 1989.
Others were working in the formerly communist countries of eastern Europe
and were sent home after those regimes collapsed. Still others were farmers
who fell victim to the dismantling of agricultural collectives in the north.
Nevertheless, some conservative party members have argued that because
unemployment first appeared after the reforms were instituted, they caused
it, and rolling them back would solve the problem.
Corruption, another subject of debate, is endemic. A year-long government
campaign has produced hundreds of examples of graft among senior and junior
officials but the interior minister, Mr Bui Thien Ngo, has already told the
National Assembly that the effort to curb corruption has failed.
The debate in the assembly appears to have grown out of concern that, if
they are left unchecked, the growing wealth gap, rising unemployment and
widespread corruption could lead to social unrest.
Reformers argue that if the government can create jobs through foreign and
domestic investment and continue its efforts to check corruption, unrest can
be avoided.
However, the conservatives continue to say that unless more central planning
government control are reintroduced, there could be a descent into chaos. In
the current political atmosphere of Hanoi, their arguments carry a great
deal of weight.

Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet has demanded tougher penalties against
corruption, saying Hanoi must win back the people's confidence as waves of
graft and money-worship sweep the country, Reuter reports from Hanoi.
Mr Kiet said Hanoi would strengthen anti-corruption laws in 1994 and 1995
and would launch a 'large campaign' to dissuade government departments from
luxury spending, the official Vietnam News Agency reported.
'The situation has become so serious that it should be prevented and driven
back by the efforts of the government and the active participation of the
whole society,' the agency quoted Mr Kiet as telling parliament on Saturday.

<TEXT>
The US will request special consultations with Japan over falling sales of
US semi-conductors in the Japanese market, Nancy Dunne writes from
Washington.
With the Uruguay Round negotiations mostly behind them, US officials expect
to focus on the thorny trade relationship with Japan, including the failure
of Japanese companies to reserve at least 20 per cent of the Japan
semi-conductor market for imports, as specified under the 1991
Semi-Conductor Arrangement.
According to Miss Charlene Barshefsky, deputy US trade representative, the
foreign market share for the third quarter of 1993 is believed to have
fallen to about 18.5 per cent, down from 19.2 per cent during the second
quarter and 20.2 per cent in the first quarter. US and Japanese officials
are to meet this week to evaluate the numbers.
In the special consultations, the US will present 'a variety of steps which
we believe they can take to rectify the situation', said Miss Barshefsky.
In a speech last week she said the area of greatest US concern was a
proposal by the Japanese Cultural Affairs Ministry to permit a broad right
of reverse engineering of computer software.
'This is not the law in the US; this is not the law in Europe. Any attempt
to embark upon this course, which has very serious implication for our
software producers and for US creativity and ingenuity in this area, would
be met with great seriousness on the part of the US,' she said.
She indicated dissatisfaction with the results of a bilateral agreement on
Japanese government procurement of super computers. US super computers have
won a few contracts but mostly when they were in partnership with Japanese
companies or the US bids were uncontested.
Miss Barshefsky also called into question Japan's commitment to ease foreign
access to its cellular telephone market. It had agreed to develop an
analogue cellular system in the Tokyo-Nagoya corridor which would then be
supplied by foreign cellular telephone producers.

INDIA
In few other countries have demands for the scrapping of the Gatt accord
been so loud as in India. No sooner had Mr Peter Sutherland declared the
negotiations completed than Indian opponents of the agreement went onto the
offensive.
They argued the ruling Congress (I) party had failed to defend India's
interests, fanning fears that the accord would somehow deprive India's
poverty-stricken farmers of subsidies and of the rights to use their own
seeds without infringing patent laws. The intellectual property rights
clauses would also, it was alleged, rob India's poor of cheap medicines.
The Economic Times, the business daily, tackled these attacks head-on in its
main leader on the Gatt agreement entitled 'Ill-informed objections'. The
paper said skilful propaganda by the domestic drugs lobby had fooled
well-meaning people into regarding the Uruguay Round as 'a western
conspiracy to re-colonise India'. Business Standard, another business daily,
supported the view that attacks on the agreement were mostly born of
ignorance. But it added there was genuine concern about textiles - India
would have to wait 10 years before the Multi-Fibre Arrangement was phased
out. 'Here the politics of world trade, where India is a lightweight, worked
against it.'
The Pioneer took up the point, saying the bulk of the benefits of the accord
would be shared by the US and Europe.
The dominance of the developed world in the talks was also forcefully taken
up by the nationalist Indian Express. It argued in its leader that
developing countries were being forced to follow economic strategies which
benefit industrialised nations by providing markets for their exports. 'Late
starters in industrialisation are to be held on a tight leash through
discriminatory patents and forced to import instead of building on their
manufacturing capabilities.'
The whole agreement reflects the overwhelming power of the US, fumed the
Express. 'Gatt has become a coercive instrument for the promotion of the
American interest.' In the view of the Economic Times, such views are a
distortion. It argued that the agreement would bring growth, trade and other
benefits for India. 'The issue is not India vs the World,' it said. 'But
Producers vs Consumers.'
UNITED STATES
The visiting senior editor from the Sacramento Bee was waiting in the White
House press room on Wednesday to hear President Bill Clinton express
satisfaction with the Gatt agreement. 'There was a time when we could not
get trade into the paper,' he observed, 'now we can't keep it out.'
Certainly no trade agreement can have received the blanket coverage accorded
the Uruguay Round by the US press last week, with most twists and turns of
the final negotiations closely followed, backed up by charts, tables and
histories of Gatt. It was more often than not the front page lead story,
until ousted by Les Aspin's resignation as secretary of defence. Even
television, rarely at ease with complex economic issues, gave it reasonably
full treatment.
Editorially, most US newspapers have traditionally been overwhelmingly in
favour of free trade. This week's leader headlines reflected this. 'After
seven years, a global gift' - the New York Times; 'At last a hurrah at the
trade talks' - the Los Angeles Times; 'The world wins one' - the Wall Street
Journal; 'The big winner' - USA Today.
There was some marginal disappointment at what was not achieved ('it is much
less than it could have been,' said the Journal of Commerce; 'It will not
turn out to be ideal. . . there are a number of disappointments,' said the
Washington Post) but near unanimity that failure would have been disastrous
('its individual provisions are much less important than its vibrant
message,' according to the New York Times.)
Predictably, the Wall Street Journal, found it hard to praise the
administration ('it seems to be dawning on some people - including some
former interventionists around the White House - that government is simply
too slow and clumsy to manage trade') and was sharpest in criticising the EC
resistance to more liberal audio-visual trade. ('The EC doesn't have a
'cultural identity'. It has at least 12, even thousands.')
FRANCE
Mr Jacques Chirac, mayor of Paris and member of parliament for Correze, is
pictured on the front page of this week's Le Canard Enchaine, the satirical
magazine, clad in farmers' clothes and grimacing at a newspaper that
trumpets the successful conclusion of the Gatt negotiations.
'Gatt: Balladur's Success,' cries the newspaper headline. 'No]' growls Mr
Chirac, who has a pitchfork tucked under his arm. 'They still haven't dealt
with the Correzienne issue.'
Other cartoons in Le Canard feature Mr Edouard Balladur himself, the
mastermind of France's Gatt machinations and Mr Chirac's main rival for the
conservative ticket in the 1995 presidential elections. 'Cher Edouard' is
shown looking even smugger than usual.
The rest of the French press may have painted a slightly subtler picture
than Le Canard's cartoonists of the political consequences of the Gatt
affair, but the message was the same. The agreement has been billed in
France as a triumph for Mr Balladur and a potential setback for Mr Chirac's
long-held presidential ambitions.
'The Right Crowns Balladur' crowed the front page headline of Thursday's
Liberation, the liberal-left daily. 'In eight months Edouard Balladur has
made the best possible use of his parliamentary majority to exert his
influence over Chirac and Giscard (the other conservative leader), while
remaining popular,' said an article entitled 'The Modest Triumph'.
Le Monde was even more laudatory. 'The confidence that the French electorate
put in Edouard Balladur was not misplaced,' it said under the portentous
headline 'The Balladur Era'.
The only cautionary note was struck by the conservative Le Figaro. 'Mr
Balladur has proved with Gatt that he is an exceptional manager of
international crises,' said its Thursday editorial. 'It remains to be seen
whether he will show the same talent for dealing with the problems of this
country - rising unemployment and social unrest.'

FT  20 DEC 93 / Italian MPs back budget: Two decrees agreed to complete
reform of electoral law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's chamber of deputies has approved the 1994 austerity budget and the
Senate is now almost certain to give the go-ahead this week, opening the way
for general elections early next year.
At the same time the government at the weekend agreed two decrees to reform
the country's existing electoral constituencies - the final piece of
electoral law reform.
With the 1994 budget approved and the electoral law complete, Mr Carlo
Azeglio Ciampi, the prime minister, has fulfilled the two fundamental tasks
he undertook when he was persuaded to leave the governorship of the Bank of
Italy and become prime minister in May.
This now leaves the way open for President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to dissolve
the parliament, in which one member in six is under investigation for
corruption-related offences. He is likely to do this in his year-end address
to the nation.
March 20 has been suggested as a possible date for general elections for
Italy to experiment with new laws that introduce the principle of a
first-past-the-post majority voting system.
The 1994 budget has been a tough test for Mr Ciampi, the first non-elected
prime minister this century. His parliamentary majority was thrown in doubt
by the collapse of his main backers, the Christian Democrats and Socialists.
These traditional ruling parties were also asked to endorse tough measures
that hit hard at their clientele with cuts in early retirement pensions and
enforced job flexibility in the civil service.
On several occasions Christian Democrats and Socialists threatened to
sabotage the budget. In contrast, the former communist party of the
Democratic Left (PDS) took the unusual step of publicly committing itself
last month to vote for the budget - even though its framework is based
entirely on market principles. The budget was approved by 276 with 49
abstentions and 35 against. The budget envisages syphoning L32,000bn (Pounds
12.8bn) out of the economy, two-thirds through spending cuts and the rest
through new taxes. The 1994 budget deficit will be cut from the 10.5 per
cent of GDP to 8.7 per cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's opposition Social Democratic party (SPD) yesterday unexpectedly
stemmed the advance of the reformed communist Party of Democratic Socialism
by winning the key city of Potsdam in the eastern state of Brandenburg,
according to exit polls.
Mr Horst Gramlich, the SPD's incumbent mayor of Potsdam, the state capital
of Brandenburg, gained a projected 56 per cent of the vote, 10 points ahead
of his main contender, Mr Rolf Kutzmutz of the PDS, who had been tipped to
clinch the post of mayor in the city in this second-round election.
The recent series of local government elections, the first in eastern German
states since unification, have shaken the established parties as the PDS,
the successor to the former Socialist Unity (communist) party, gained 21 per
cent of the first-round vote, while the governing Christian Democrats, led
by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, received only 22 per cent.
The defeat of Mr Kutzmutz, who, in the first round, polled 43 per cent of
the vote, ahead of Mr Gramlich's 30 per cent, is an obvious setback for the
PDS, which believed that it was set to become the strong regional party for
eastern Germany.
Mr Kutzmutz, an admitted informer for the former east East German secret
police, the Stasi, had run an efficient campaign aimed at the unemployed and
those who felt aggrieved that Germany's established parties failed to
consider the particular social and economic problems of eastern Germany
since unification.
However officials at Brandenburg's SPD, which had managed to secure about 34
per cent of the vote in the first round, were determined to prevent the PDS
from becoming an established political force in Potsdam, and a potential
threat in next year's marathon round of local, state, and federal elections.
For its part, the CDU secured the industrial city of Cottbus.
Exit polls gave the party a comfortable lead of 71 per cent over its main
PDS rival which by last night had 29 per cent of the vote.
The SPD clinched a landslide victory over the PDS in Brandenburg, the other
main city included in the run-off.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Oil-rich infants vulnerable to Moscow bullying: Popularity
of Zhirinovsky increases Russian threat to republics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The southern belt of the former Soviet Union and its infant petro-economy is
perhaps the most vulnerable of Moscow's neighbours to a more aggressive
foreign policy.
The region, from the Black Sea to China's western border, seems threatened
on various levels by the resurgent Russia promised by the Liberal Democratic
leader, Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, whose neo-fascist party won a large bloc of
seats in parliamentary elections just over a week ago.
Among the worries south of Russia is the prospect of agitation by the
south's ethnic Russian population which, according to incomplete returns,
supported Mr Zhirinovksy in equal or even larger numbers than he received
overall at home.
The backdrop to the anxiety is that, while much of the region may manage to
assert itself once its oil and natural gas industries develop, the south
still manages little resistance to Moscow's political and military
dominance. Even before the election, an aggressive Moscow had reclaimed
rights in Azerbaijan's rich offshore oilfields, Georgia's strategic Black
Sea ports and Tajikistan's mountainous buffer zone against radical Islam.
The first signs of trouble have already appeared in the eight-nation region
(Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, Armenia,
Georgia and Kyrgyzstan). In Kazakhstan, Mr Zhirinovsky's birthplace, which
like Ukraine has a large ethnic Russian population, a nationalistic Slavic
group called Lad (Concord) adopted some of Mr Zhirinovsky's ideas at a
political conference last Saturday.
The conference, held in the Russian-dominated northern city of Pavlodar to
prepare for the republic's March 7 parliamentary elections, approved a
platform including the establishment of a joint army and open borders with
Russia, a return to the rouble zone, and the legalisation of dual
citizenship.
Mr Valery Galeyko, head of Pavlodar's leading Russian-speaking association
called the Slavic Community, says Lad also plans alliances with local ethnic
Germans, Tatars and Chechens, to oppose what it considers Kazakh
discrimination. 'We need dual citizenship to restore the destroyed Soviet
Union,' Mr Galeyko says.
Lad's declaration may be only the beginning of the republic's ethnic
problems resulting from the elections. 'When a neighbour's house is burning
you cannot stay quiet,' says Mr Manash Kozybaev, a historian in the Kazakh
capital, Alma-Ata. 'Russia is not burning yet, but there are those who want
to set it on fire.'
Kazakhistan is also insecure economically. Although one day it will be
wealthy from its huge oil resources, today it is entirely dependent on
Russia to refine and transport its oil.
All of central Asia is vulnerable to Moscow to some degree.
Russian forces, for example, are the conspicuous military backbone across
central Asia's southern border with Afghanistan and Iran. Some 6,000 Russian
officers supervise Turkmenistan's fledgling army. Ninety per cent of
Uzbekistan's military officers are ethnic Russians. And Tajikistan is
completely dependent on a more than 25,000-strong Russian force to protect
its southern and eastern frontiers against a radical Islamic-led opposition.
The same predicament is faced in the Caucasus. Before agreeing grudgingly to
join the Moscow-dominated Commonwealth of Independent States, Georgia and
Azerbaijan reached the brink of disintegration in wars that were armed and,
according to an abundance of evidence, encouraged by forces in Moscow.
Azerbaijan now seems likely to face even greater pressure to succumb to
Russian demands for a 20 per cent stake in a British Petroleum-led
consortium that has negotiated rights to exploit 4bn barrels of offshore
oil. Moscow also wants Baku to abandon the idea of shipping its oil through
Turkey, a step that would strip Russia of its leverage as Azerbaijan's sole
distribution point.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Milosevic may have to form coalition

<TEXT>
The Socialists of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic last night were
leading parliamentary elections by a narrow margin as Serbia voted amid
economic collapse.
But early, unofficial results suggested that the Socialists were unlikely to
win a majority of the 250-seat parliament and would be forced to form a
coalition government. Full unofficial results are expected today.
While Mr Milosevic was not facing re-election, the poll was seen as a
crucial test of whether he could keep his hold over Serbia, with inflation
running at a monthly rate of 45,000 per cent. A spokesman for the Socialists
said Mr Milosevic's party was headed for victory throughout Serbia.
By contrast, leaders of DEPOS, the opposition coalition, and the centrist
Democratic party, last night claimed a strong showing in Belgrade and in
other Serbian towns, winning more than 30 per cent of the votes counted,
according to partial results.
As he cast his ballot yesterday. Mr Milosevic said: 'I am expecting
successful elections and a stable government.' However, if the initial
results are borne out, the poll will fail to deliver the Serbian president a
compliant government. He called the early elections, Serbia's third in four
years, after ultra-nationalist allies threatened to bring down his Socialist
government.
Officials said more than 50 per cent of Serbia's 7m voters had turned out
for the poll.

Greece's Socialist government faces an awkward task in replacing 35
high-ranking military officers who resigned at the weekend in protest at the
recall of four retired officers to head the general staff, writes Kerin Hope
in Athens. The country's military command structure has been virtually wiped
out by the mass resignations, which included a dozen lieutenant generals and
all but one admiral serving on the naval command council. The officers are
reportedly reluctant to serve under the commanders appointed last week
because of their ties with the Socialists.

The Ukrainian government said at the weekend it had reached a preliminary
agreement with the US and Russia on the 'idea of compensation' in exchange
for Ukraine's relinquishing of its nuclear arsenal, Jill Barshay reports in
Kiev.
There was no confirmation of the deal yesterday in Washington or Moscow.
However, Mr Al Gore, US vice-president, said in Budapest: 'All sides will
tell you that progress is being made.'
If agreement on financial compensation for uranium is worked out in
subsequent talks, it would remove one of the three main conditions Ukraine
has imposed for giving up its remaining 176 strategic missiles and becoming
a non-nuclear state. Ukraine's other demands are technical aid for
dismantlement and security guarantees.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Aid lifeline for Ekostahl: An east German town which hopes
to stop the rot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ingrid Kruger, 55, said: 'Its a nice Christmas present.' She worked at the
Ekostahl steel mill for 27 years. But after German unification, like many
other women in the plant, she lost her job.
'We waited three years for this decision from Brussels. It's a good day for
the people of Eisenhuttenstadt. I just hope its for real.'
Under the terms of Friday's European Union decision, the German government
and the Treuhand privatisation agency will be allowed to pour more than
DM1bn (Pounds 300m) of subsidies into the Ekostahl mill in the eastern state
of Brandenburg.
The subsidies will be used to modernise the plant as well as install a
hot-rolling mill. Riva, the Milan-based privately-owned steel company which
has sole negotiating rights to buy Ekostahl from the Treuhand, reckons the
mill will have an annual capacity of about 2m tonnes after modernisation is
complete.
'I don't care about levels of capacity. The most important thing is that the
mill will stay open,' said Mr Ralph Bakema, a 42-year-old technician who has
worked at Ekostahl for the past 20 years. 'You see, there's nothing else
around here. Eisenhuttenstadt was built around the steel plant in the early
1950s. If that goes, we'll have nothing left. The shops and services won't
have any customers. The region will be a wasteland.'
The shopkeepers were hoping business would pick up before Christmas. There
was little activity along the town's main street. People were standing at
the make-shift market stalls, drinking hot mulled wine or beer, stamping
their feet to warm themselves. A few Poles had arrived. They immediately
opened their car boots and started selling toys.
'Money is scarce. People go across the border to shop,' said Heide, who was
selling flowers. The border with Poland is only 20km away. 'Why should
anyone set up a business here when the wages are one-tenth the price down
the road,' she added. 'Maybe if we really get those subsidies and find a
buyer for Ekostahl, business might pick up.'
More than 8,000 of a previous 12,000 workforce at the mill have already been
made redundant. The unemployment rate in the town of some 50,000 people is
running at 23 per cent. The subsidies are not expected to guarantee all the
remaining jobs. If anything, the modernisation plan will require even fewer
workers. The people of Eisenhuttenstadt have few illusions.
'I'm not so sure about the future,' said Mr Helmut Appa, 52, who used to
work at the plant until three years ago. 'We'll only get real security for a
certain number of jobs once the plant is privatised.
He added: 'We fought hard for those subsidies. The steel producers over in
west Germany never showed the slightest bit of solidarity with us. And I
know why. They were afraid that if we managed to get the subsidies, we would
really become competitive.'
Mr Helmut Eckhert, a retired craftsman, said: 'We should be given the chance
to become competitive. And that is why we demand special treatment.' When it
was pointed out that Ravenscraig in Scotland had to close its gates because
of overcapacity, he said Eisenhuttenstadt was a different case.
'We lost everything after the Wende (fall of the Wall). We lost the markets,
the subsidies, jobs for life, cheap housing. Everything has gone too fast,'
he said. 'Now Brussels tells us everything. How much to produce, how much to
grow. Its ridiculous the speed in which we have been plunged into these
changes,' he added.

<TEXT>
After a year of acrimony, agreement last Friday set the seal on total aid of
Ecu6.791bn (Pounds 5.17bn) for subsidised steel companies in Germany, Italy,
Spain and Portugal. But it heralded a period of tough monitoring by the
European Commission.
The subsidised companies will be cutting capacity of more than 5m tonnes,
but virtually every step they take will be watched. If the Commission
decides its conditions are not being respected, it could demand suspension
or even reimbursement of subsidies.
The four member states will have to send the Commission reports at least
twice a year on the producers concerned, covering everything from production
levels to financial performance. In particular, companies will have to prove
that any investment which increases steel capacity is not being financed by
state aid.
Ministers agreed to write into each decision a clause stressing that if the
company concerned does not return to profitability, further state subsidies
will be turned down. Ministers also agreed to make a 'firm commitment to
avoid any further Article 95 derogations in respect of aid for any
individual companies'.
Article 95 allows the European Union to exempt subsidy plans from the
outright ban on subsidies contained in the Treaty of Paris, on which the
European Coal and Steel Community is based. As Commission and national
officials admitted on Friday, the political declaration limiting aid will
not be legally binding. Until the Treaty of Paris expires in 2002,
governments will still be able to demand exemption for state subsidies: the
implication, however, is that the Commission will be tougher next time in
enforcing the treaty's ban on state aids.
Friday's meeting reached unanimous agreement on six separate proposals,
making up the largest package of state aid for the steel industry since the
crisis of the 1980s. These were the main conclusions:
Ilva: the state-owned Italian producer will cut 1.2m tonnes of annual
production at its Taranto plant, and the buyer of Ilva's flat products
business will close a further 500,000 tonnes elsewhere - although the
product area is not specified as the British industry has pointed out.
No figure has been put on the capacity to be cut at Bagnoli, a dormant hot
strip mill which will be shut down for good. In the Commission's original
figures Bagnoli accounted for 300,000 tonnes, but Italy always argued it was
worth more. Bagnoli must still be closed but in the final document the
figure for capacity reduction has been left blank.
Ekostahl: The UK and Denmark were worried about the restructuring of the
east German producer and at one point it looked as though Denmark might
block an overall deal, on the grounds that steel from Ekostahl would compete
directly with a non-aided Danish plant.
In the end the two countries won key amendments to the deal. Production at
the company's new hot strip mill will be limited to 900,000 tonnes a year
until 1999. For the five years after that, according to the Commission, it
will be limited to 'significantly below 2m tonnes'.
Mr Tim Sainsbury, the UK's industry minister, was more precise about the
figure. On Friday he said he had won a commitment from the Germans that Riva
 -the Italian company which is bidding to buy Ekostahl - would limit annual
production to 1.65m tonnes up to 2004.
Mr Melchior Wathelet, the Belgian industry minister who chaired the meeting,
stressed that new production during the first five years would be used
'exclusively for further processing in Ekostahl's cold rolling facilities'.
He also said that 1.65m tonnes represented the capacity of the cold rolling
facilities at Ekostahl.
CSI: The Spanish industry minister, Mr Jose Manuel Eguiagaray, managed to
persuade his counterparts that the flat products plant at Ansio, near
Bilbao, would close at the end of 1995, instead of the middle of 1995 as
originally agreed with the Commission.
However, he signed up to a text which said CSI would do its best to close
the plant earlier.
Deals involving Siderurgica Nacional in Portugal, Freital in Germany and
Sidenor in Spain completed the package.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Italians face tough task, says Savona
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paolo Savona, the Italian industry minister, has warned that the
country's steel industry faces a tight timetable to comply with the
agreement reached last week by EU ministers to cut steel capacity.
The warning comes in spite of Italy obtaining a better deal than had been
expected.
Government subsidies to the state-dominated steel sector and Italy's
consistent refusal to reduce capacity has been the most serious source of
friction on industrial policy between Rome and Brussels for more than three
years.
The agreement, endorsed last Friday by EU industry ministers, involved
Brussels accepting that Ilva, the Italian state steelmaker, envisages a
reduction of 2m tonnes in overall Italian steel capacity. The concession
accepted by Brussels was that this cut be spread between the state and
private sector instead of wholly on Ilva.
The EU ministers also accepted that L500bn (Pounds 201m) in tax credits for
Ilva would not be treated as subsidies.
Though pleased at being able to keep alive a third production line of flat
products at Ilva's Taranto complex, the biggest steel works in Europe, Mr
Savona warned Italy was under tight surveillance. The first inspection of a
special monitoring commission would be in March.
If the timetables were not met and Italy failed to proceed with its planned
privatisation of Ilva, the agreement could unwind. There would then be no
further opportunity for the EU to endorse a state-aided solution to the
losses in the steel industry.
The Italians also said they would watch the position of the British and
Danish governments which have pledged to placed the deal before their
respective parliaments. The agreement paves the way for Ilva's
privatisation, with the group being split into two - one for flat products,
the other for special steels. Mr Savona said he expected that Iri, the state
holding and Ilva's proprietor, should obtain L4,100bn from the sale, due to
be competed by the end of 1994.
In tandem with the privatisation process, the government now has to address
the problems of several loss-makers in the private sector and establish how
at least 500,000 tonnes of annual capacity is to be cut. Mr Savona said that
some 3m tonnes of steel was being produced by companies with problems.
The government's problems with Ilva's workforce and especially its
sub-contractors are also unlikely to be resolved easily.
Between 10,000 and 12,000 jobs are expected to be lost at Ilva, over a
quarter of the workforce. The Bagnoli plant at Naples has been closed for
two years but occupied for most of this time by workers hoping the plant
could be saved.
At Taranto 170 workers employed by sub-contractors forced the plant almost
to shut down on two days last week.

FT  20 DEC 93 / EU steel industry moves to next phase of battle: The
spotlight will now shift to the non-aided steelmakers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's steel industry, battered by recession and deep-seated structural
problems, moves into a new stage in its fight for survival and long-term
prosperity this week after the resolution of a series of wrangles over state
subsidies.
During the past year, unsubsidised steelmakers and their spokesmen have
lobbied vociferously from the sidelines as the European Commission struggled
to win approval from member states for a package of deals to end state aid.
Now, with industry ministers unanimously agreeing in Brussels on a deal
involving some 5m tonnes of capacity cuts by state-aided producers, the
spotlight shifts onto the non-aided steelmakers.
To fulfil the Commission's target of reducing overcapacity by 30m tonnes a
year of crude steel, they would have to offer capacity cuts of 25m tonnes.
Judging by the anger and sharp words following Friday's meeting, the cuts
are unlikely to be handed to the Commission on a plate.
Some of the non-aided sector's planned cuts are already known. But most
private-sector companies have held back from offering cuts until the state
subsidy cases were resolved. The stance of the unsubsidised companies,
therefore, is now crucial to the success of the entire initiative to
restructure the industry. Unless overall capacity is reduced, the industry
will have failed to address one of its fundamental structural weaknesses.
The private sector, however, is deeply worried by Friday's deal and
questions whether it will resolve the industry's long-term problems,
whatever cuts in capacity are offered.
Mr Ian Rodgers of the British Iron and Steel Producers' Association says:
'All the way along the Commission was looking for the easy way out, rather
than the most stringent solution consistent with the Treaty of Paris.'
The Commission and the industry ministers said that ending subsidies was the
only way to secure a healthy EU steel industry. But by operating in the way
it did, says Mr Rodgers, the Commission had failed to send the signal that
countries could never come back with a begging bowl if a steelmaker gets
into trouble. The industry's disappointment was shared by independent
observers. 'The nettle has not been grasped,' says Mr Steven Randall of
Beddows &amp; Co, the London-based steel consultants. 'Private-sector companies
will ask why they should have to make cuts when loss-making state companies
will survive for the foreseeable future.'
There are two reasons, however, why the non-aided steelmakers are likely to
come up with some or all of the capacity cuts, even though the Commission
cannot force them to do so.
First, Mr Martin Bangemann, the EU's industry commissioner, warned on Friday
that other elements of the Commission's rescue plan, such as Ecu240m (Pounds
183m) to help pay for redundancies, and safeguards to limit imports from
eastern Europe, would be withdrawn if unsubsidised steelmakers did not
volunteer capacity cuts.
Secondly, steelmakers are realistic enough to accept that, whatever their
feelings, the subsidies agreement is now set in stone. By deliberately
withholding capacity reductions in a declining market, the industry could be
cutting off its nose to spite its face.
Mr Peter Fish, managing director of the Sheffield-based Meps Europe
consultancy, says: 'I think steelmakers will go along with the plan, albeit
reluctantly, but whether the capacity cuts will be as deep as they might
have been is a different question.'
There is also concern about where the cuts will come from. Achieving a
20m-tonne reduction would require about 10m of cuts on top of the 10m-11m
already indicated in Germany and France.
But Mr Fish believes this will come more from the long products sector,
where reducing heavy overcapacity does nothing to help the flat products
producers. 'I don't see large integrated producers closing strip mill
products plants - maybe a couple of plate mills and associated melting shops
will close.'

FT  20 DEC 93 / Trafalgar House-Bouygues contest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two of Britain's and France's largest construction companies are leading
rival consortia which have been short-listed to bid for one of Europe's
largest private infrastructure projects.
Trafalgar House of Britain and Bouygues of France are competing to build the
Pounds 500m privately-financed toll road bridge across the river Tagus close
to the Portuguese capital, Lisbon.
French and Portuguese authorities established good relations during the
recent Gatt trade negotiations when both countries adopted similar policies
on agriculture.
Trafalgar House, however, is understood to have stressed in negotiations
that its consortium commands a higher proportion of independent Portuguese
companies than the Bouygues-led bid. Trafalgar holds just under 25 per cent
of its Lusoponte consortium. It also has a French partner, Campenon Bernard,
which holds a similar stake. Five Portuguese companies own the remaining 50
per cent.
Bouygues's bid is supported by Dragados, the Spanish construction company.
Both groups are understood to have stressed the importance of their local
Portuguese operations. The contract is viewed as an important potential
stepping stone to other projects as European countries increasingly look to
private companies to finance developments which previously would have been
funded by the public sector.
Bouygues and Trafalgar House have led the way in building private
infrastructure projects in their own countries.
The concession to operate the new bridge, due to start operating in 1998, is
expected to run for 30 years. Contracts are expected to be signed with the
successful bidder by March. The two consortia have been short-listed from an
original list of six bidders. The 18km toll viaduct and cable bridge
proposed by Trafalgar would become part of the city's northern regional
highway system.
Financial backing for Trafalgar's bid comes from five Portuguese financial
institutions and 11 international banks.

FT  20 DEC 93 / EU agreement on steel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The EU agreement on steel restructuring, once formally approved, paves the
way for two other separate agreements, writes Andrew Hill. One is on a new
structure for aid to the Union's coal industry, due to come into force on
December 31, and another on the directive opening up competition in the oil
and gas exploration sector. Before the steel pact was struck, Italy had been
holding up these other two proposals in an attempt to persuade Germany to
agree on the steel package.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Sharply higher Christmas sales boost retailers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY and FT Regional Reporters
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Retailers in most of the UK yesterday reported encouraging sales in the last
weekend before Christmas and a greatly improved sense of confidence among
their customers.
Shoppers appeared to welcome the decision taken by many retailers to ignore
the law against Sunday trading and flocked to some shopping centres in
record numbers. Many stores reported a sharp increase in sales after a
November that was subdued ahead of the Budget.
Retailers were relieved that consumer confidence seemed to have returned.
They were also optimistic that this year would be an improvement on last
year and considerably better than 1991, their worst Christmas in recent
years.
Shops in the south-east, one of the areas hardest hit during the recession
by the fall in property values, appeared to have been among the main
beneficiaries of the increase in seasonal sales.
Liberty and Bentalls, which have branches in the home counties, reported
sharply higher sales and were looking forward to a strong finish this week.
Bentalls said sales were 17 per cent up on last year.
Many retailers expecting this weekend to be their busiest were not
disappointed, but they will only be able to report a 'good Christmas' if the
late surge continues through Christmas eve.
Mr George McDonald, manager of the Eldon Square shopping centre in
Newcastle, one of Europe's biggest city centre complexes, said: 'There's a
feeling of confidence. People are saying it's better than last year. The
final analysis will be how that final week comes out.'
The optimism seemed to be relatively well spread across the country. The
number of people shopping and the amount they were spending were reported
sharply up in Glasgow and the Midlands as well as London and the south east.
Some shops in Leeds reported a 40 per cent increase in sales over last year.
Selfridges, the Oxford Street retailer, believes the 1.5m shoppers who
visited the department store last week, a 90,000 increase on the same week
last year, spent at least 13 per cent more than in the same period last
year.
In the west country and south Wales, sales were more disappointing, with
retailers reporting steady weekend shopping but no surge. In Cheltenham,
sales at one of the main centres was slightly down on a week before.
There was also a note of caution from the MetroCentre, Gateshead's enormous
shopping complex, which is expecting 500,000 visitors this week. 'I think
people are perhaps being a little bit more cautious in what they're
spending,' said a manager. 'Perhaps there isn't quite so much money around.'

FT  20 DEC 93 / Reynolds warns IRA of crackdown: Irish PM will help UK over
security if peace moves fail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, yesterday warned he would help
Britain impose a tough security clamp-down against the IRA if it did not
respond positively to the two governments' bid to bring peace to Northern
Ireland.
As Mr Reynolds sought to put further pressure on the IRA to give up its
25-year armed struggle against Britain's presence in Ulster, Mr John Major,
the British prime minister, appealed to Ulster unionists to recognise the
initiative as the last chance for peace.
Mr Reynolds warned on BBC radio that both governments 'would be expected to
respond' if loyalists and nationalists resumed the path of violence: 'After
a period in which such strong support has been expressed by the people in
both communities for peace, I think there would be revulsion over a
resumption of full-scale violence,' he said.
Mr Reynolds ruled out a return to internment for terrorist suspects, which
he said was 'the strongest recruiting platform that the IRA were handed'.
It seems increasingly unlikely that Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing,
will deliver an early response to the two governments' declaration last
Wednesday.
An indication of Sinn Fein's position came from Mr John Hume, leader of the
Social Democratic and Labour Party, speaking after talks yesterday with Mr
Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president. Mr Hume said he believed Mr Adams was
'very serious' about peace in the region.
In the Sunday Tribune newspaper in Dublin, Mr Adams said: 'Republicans will
be considering (the joint declaration) in the context of Sinn Fein's peace
strategy. We will approach it positively and seek to move the peace strategy
forward.'
The Republican movement, he said, would consider the declaration 'over
Christmas and for some time after that . . . There are no quick fixes in
this situation'.
However, a bomb explosion in Londonderry yesterday showed the IRA was not
committed to an unofficial ceasefire while deciding what action to take.
Three children and two adults narrowly escaped being killed in the blast,
which was the first attack since Wednesday's Downing Street declaration.
Mr Reynolds tempered his warning about a security clampdown with hints of
benefits to the IRA if it sued for peace.
He also suggested London might negotiate over 'the future of prisoners' held
in British jails: 'I think that's what the British government would have in
mind in exploratory talks with Sinn Fein which they said would be within
three months.'
Downing Street officials said that the subject of prisoners was not among
initial proposals for talks with Sinn Fein in the aftermath of a ceasefire.
A Downing Street spokeswoman emphasised that British jails contained
'criminals' not 'political prisoners'.
Unionist politicians also warned that they would oppose any amnesty for IRA
prisoners as part of an overall deal.
Mr Major's appeal to Northern Ireland's Unionists to accept the peace
initiative, in an article for the Belfast newspaper, Sunday Life, said the
joint initiative did not undermine the union between Britain and Northern
Ireland.
Mr Major said: 'I support the union. I have always supported the union. That
is my personal right.' However he went on: 'But I shall not seek to impose
my view on the greater number of people of Northern Ireland if they decide
otherwise.'

FT  20 DEC 93 / ANC takes step towards agreeing to Afrikaner homeland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The African National Congress and South Africa's white right-wing groups
have reached agreement in principle to establish a 'homeland' for
Afrikaners, a significant symbolic concession to rightwing whites who fear
black majority rule.
The agreement, which has not yet been made public, is due to be signed
tomorrow in Johannesburg. It is understood to be hedged with conditions and
is only a first step to a firm deal.
No agreement appears to have been reached on important questions such as the
borders of the proposed homeland, whether blacks living in it would be
allowed to vote, and the powers of the homeland government.
But the accord has important symbolic value, and illustrates the ANC's
commitment to persuading rightwing whites to contest next year's all-race
elections.
In the agreement, the Afrikaner Volksfront (Afrikaner People's Front), the
umbrella group which represents most right-wing Afrikaners, commits itself
to participate in the poll if detailed agreement on a homeland is reached
early next year.
The two sides will now enter intensive talks designed to meet the timetable
for detailed agreements in January and February.
Difficult negotiations lie ahead over what the term 'volkstaat' (people's
state, or homeland) will mean. It is highly unlikely that an independent
ethnic state such as Israel could be created for the Afrikaners because
there is no substantial area where they are in the majority, and little
likelihood that large numbers would move to a newly-created state.
Instead, the 'volkstaat' could consist of small areas, sub-regions within
the country's provinces, where Afrikaners could exercise some autonomy.
Asked to define the degree of autonomy required in a volkstaat, one AVF
representative said: 'If emotionally the people feel they are governing
themselves, that would be a volkstaat. Language would be a huge thing.'
Control over education would also be important. The Swiss cantonal system,
studied by a joint ANC-AVF delegation, may be used as a model.
But the AVF is not a monolith and hard right groups are holding out for a
more powerful ethnic state. The radical leader of the white-supremacist
Conservative Party, Mr Ferdi Hartzenberg, is understood to support
tomorrow's accord, but reaching detailed agreement with him could prove
difficult.
Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader, has been strongly against demands for an
Afrikaner homeland, although he has said significant power could be devolved
to Afrikaner areas. 'Sure, we've got a long way to go,' said one AVF
official. 'But when we started, it was only a dream.'
Negotiators from the government, the ANC and the right-wing Freedom Alliance
were to meet this morning in last-ditch attempts to agree on constitutional
amendments before the new constitution passes through parliament on
Wednesday.

FT  20 DEC 93 / Fisons plans closures and job cuts to restore confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fisons, the troubled pharmaceuticals and scientific equipment group, is
planning plant closures and large-scale redundancies in an attempt to
restore confidence in the company after the dismissal last week of chief
executive Mr Cedric Scroggs.
A restructuring programme already expected to save Pounds 25m in the
pharmaceuticals division is to be widened to include a review of the
loss-making scientific instruments business.
Mr Patrick Egan, chairman and acting chief executive, said yesterday: 'Some
parts of it will be closed, some sold and some rationalised. Turnover will
shrink but it should become profitable.' Three directors have been appointed
to strengthen the board after Mr Scroggs' departure, while a finance
director is likely to be named soon.
The poor performance of the instruments division, which is expected to make
a loss this year of Pounds 16m against a Pounds 12m profit in 1992, was
cited by the company last week as the main reason for Mr Scroggs' departure.
It also emerged at the weekend that the non-executive directors had
considered forcing Mr Scroggs, who was promoted to chief executive in April
1992 after 13 years with the group, to resign on two previous occasions this
year.
As part of the restructuring, separate businesses manufacturing organic
analysis equipment are likely to be merged while the loss-making surface
science operation, which produces equipment for such areas as soil analysis,
may be scaled back. Some of these plans are understood to have been in place
before Mr Scroggs was sacked.
His departure came amid controversy over Fisons' accounting practices in the
pharmaceuticals division. These practices included boosting sales and
profits by offering wholesale customers discounts to buy excess stock at the
financial year-end. Gross profits on these sales were treated as net gains.
Mr Egan said he was unaware of the practice, introduced in 1984, until early
last year and was not told that the division was showing 70 per cent profits
on discount sales. 'We didn't appreciate the size of the margins on
discounting,' he said.
Nevertheless, Mr Egan acknowledged that some directors had benefited from
the discounting practice because it boosted the company's apparent
profitability and the share price at a time when the board stood to gain
from favourable share options. He claimed, however, that the manipulation,
highlighted in yesterday's Sunday Times, was not designed specifically to
produce windfalls for directors with sizeable options.
Fisons, which had begun to wind down discounting last year, has now
abandoned the practice.
Mr Egan, meanwhile, confirmed that moves to oust the chief executive were
discussed in May when the losses emerged in the instruments business. He
said the plans were postponed on the advice of financial advisers SG
Warburg, who were concerned at a possible management vacuum when Mr Roy
Thomas, then finance director, announced plans to retire early. According to
Mr Egan, in August SG Warburg again dissuaded him from sacking Mr Scroggs.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Police told to probe Lib Dems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scotland Yard said last night it had been asked by Sir Nicholas Lyell,
attorney-general, 'to look at the allegation of incitement to racial hatred'
made against Liberal Democrats in Tower Hamlets.
The investigation will centre on whether a leaflet issued by the party in
the east London borough amounts to an incitement to racial hatred. Scotland
Yard said the instruction by Sir Nicholas had been made at the request of Mr
Jack Straw, chief Labour environment spokesman.
Earlier, the local Liberal Democrats faced a split over the issue after an
internal inquiry recommended the expulsion of three party members.
Mr Jeremy Shaw, one of three accused of circulating racist leaflets, said
local members were 'very likely' to set up a splinter group. A substantial
breakaway could deprive the Liberal Democrats of its eight-seat majority on
Tower Hamlets council, which the party won from Labour in 1986.
The internal inquiry, chaired by Lord Lester, a Liberal Democrat peer, was
set up after controversial leaflets were published during a council
by-election won by the far-right British National Party.
The report contains an indictment of campaigning tactics by Tower Hamlets
Liberal Democrats during the past three years. The tactics continued after
the inquiry was established.
The report also urges the national party to appoint a campaigns officer to
monitor Tower Hamlets until after local elections next May.
The three members, who deny racism, have the right to appeal to an
independent panel to be set up by the party. The report says the members
involved did not intend to stir up racial prejudice. But their populist
approach pandered to resentment and anxiety among local white voters.
The report's most damaging section asserts that the national Liberal
Democrat party knew what was happening in Tower Hamlets three years ago, but
took 'no effective concerted action'.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, tried quickly last night to
limit electoral damage to the party by making clear that it would act firmly
to end racism.
Mr Graham Tope, president of the Liberal Democrat London region, said the
exposure of racism in Tower Hamlets was unlikely to affect the party's
prospects in the elections.
He said: 'Where people comment at all, they recognise that this party has
not tried to sweep it under the carpet. Far from hurting us next May, I
think it is going to help us.' Mr Straw called the report 'a whitewash'.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Exporters slam DTI on new law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Institute of Export yesterday protested to the government about
'ineffective' consultation with industry and corporate lawyers about the new
laws on commercial agents, which come into force on January 1.
Complaints about poor consultation have been mounting throughout the autumn
as exporters realised the new laws were going to raise costs and that some
companies were unlikely to have enough time to adjust.
The final straw that led the institute to write to Mr Richard Needham, trade
minister, appears to have been a new section in the final form of the
regulations. This was unexpectedly published last week with no time for
amendment, less than three weeks before the regulations become law.
It changed the way agents should be compensated when sacked. In all drafts,
Britain appeared to be opting for damages rather than the fixed-indemnity
formulae favoured by most other European Union countries. Since damages are
negotiable, most lawyers acting for exporters believed this would generally
offer the cheapest option if companies and agents fell out.
But, according to Mr Michael Thornton, a solicitor who is co-author of a
standard textbook explaining the laws, the new regulations say both methods
shall be used, allowing agents to claim a fixed indemnity worth one year's
commission averaged over five years, plus damages.
He added that he and other specialist lawyers had not been consulted.
'Somebody is going to have to say you can have one or the other, or does
this now mean you can only have damages if the sum exceeds the indemnity?'
Some lawyers believe the new laws - which implement a 1986 EC directive -
may actually be wrong, as the directive appears to stipulate an 'either/or'
approach to compensation.
Mr Thornton, a partner specialising in export law at the Manchester office
of Laytons, added: 'It's a bit rich for this to appear in the final version
when it didn't appear in any of the drafts. It has just been slapped in by
somebody in the Department of Industry and now appears as the law.'
Mr Ian Campbell, director-general of the Institute of Export, said: 'The
government banged out a few drafts to a few people and said they had
consulted. They had not.' Inquirers were refused a list of consultees by the
DTI, making it difficult to liaise and co-ordinate responses in the common
interests of industry and commerce, he added.
Mr Thornton added: 'Someone in the DTI must love lawyers. Many companies
will need possibly expensive legal assistance just to check if the laws
apply to them.'

<TEXT>
Argentine government security forces yesterday retook control of the
north-western city of Santiago del Estero, where rioters on Thursday burned
down public buildings, ransacked the homes of local politicians and looted
shops, writes John Barham in Buenos Aires.
In the worst rioting Argentina has seen since hyperinflation gripped the
country in 1989, about 5,000 public employees took to the streets in protest
at unpaid wages and plans to eliminate government jobs.
Officials said six people were killed, 120 treated in hospital and 170
arrested.
President Carlos Menem returned yesterday to Buenos Aires, cutting short a
visit to the Vatican. Congress voted to dissolve the provincial government
and authorised the federal government to appoint an administrator to run the
province for five months. The government sent the province Dollars 60m to
pay wages.
Like nearly all Argentina's 23 provinces, Santiago del Estero's public
sector is the largest employer and relies heavily on federal transfers for
its spending. NEWS IN BRIEF

   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A military delegation will next week make another attempt to persuade
Haiti's army and police leaders to accept the return of a United Nations
mission paving the way for a return to democracy, writes George Graham. The
delegation is being sent by the US, France, Canada and Venezuela, the 'four
friends' who have taken the lead in the international community's response
to the Haitian crisis.
Although Clinton administration officials yesterday firmly denied newspaper
reports that the US was on the point of abandoning efforts to restore ousted
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to office, they acknowledge that, after the
collapse of acting prime minister Robert Malval's attempt to call a new
political conference, they have few ideas on how to speed the process, other
than waiting for the oil embargo against Haiti to bite.

<TEXT>
A federal judge in Philadelphia has approved a legal settlement involving 6m
pick-up trucks made by General Motors between 1973 and 1987, AP-DJ reports
from Detroit. The settlement requires GM to give Dollars 1,000 coupons to
owners of GM pick-ups with side-mounted fuel tanks. The coupons can only be
used to buy GM trucks, most of which have profit margins greater than
Dollars 1,000. Analysts say the settlement will increase GM's profits.
Safety critics intend to appeal against the settlement, which covers 49
states. In Texas, a separate settlement was reached.
The settlements in Texas and in Philadelphia end more than 20 separate suits
seeking compensation for owners of GM pick-ups with side-mounted tanks. The
federal government says the pick-ups are more likely than comparable
vehicles to erupt in flames when hit from the side.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Private View: A dreamer with designs on life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
James Gardner's 70-year career began with Nellie Melba. Now he is working on
Stonehenge
Their work is all around us but we never know their names. They shape
everything we see, from soap trays to shopping arcades, and leave behind no
mark, no signature. These anonymous people are called designers.
Who, for example, created the plastic shades that pull down over aircraft
windows? Or the tree walk in Battersea Park? Or the superstructure of the
QE2? As it happens, the answer to all these questions is James Gardner, a
man known to his friends as 'G' and to the rest of his countrymen . . .
hardly at all.
Gardner has been designing things for more than 70 years. At the age of 15,
he was at Cartier's studio in London's Bond Street working on a tiara for
opera star Dame Nellie Melba.
At 86 - which he will be in 11 days - he is doing a visitor centre for
Stonehenge, a warfare museum for Hartlepool and an archaeological park for
the Israeli desert.
'I'll be about 90 by the time it's finished,' he said. 'So I'd better put
ramps in, hadn't I'
When I asked him why designers in Britain were invisible, he said it was
because they were not regarded as 'professionals'. They were seated always
at the bottom of the table.
Things are different abroad: arriving once in Sweden by boat, he found
cameras at the quayside. 'I thought it was some politician or starlet going
ashore. I went down and it was me they were taking]'
The English were more literary than visual and were mentally anarchic and
lazy, he said. They took their gifted Renaissance children and taught them
to suppress their physical and visual senses. Gardner says he escaped.
'Education didn't touch me. I just ignored it. I was completely
unteachable.'
Were you bolshie?
'No, not particularly bolshie, just not interested. So the childish part of
my brain still remains, you see. Directly I left school, I started reading
and studying the books I didn't want to read at school.'
You knew you could draw and that was enough?
'That was my way out, you see - an easy way out. The teachers were enemies
in a sense, actors who knew the lines when I didn't. I wasn't all that
interested in the play, anyway.'
He was born a spectator and recorder. 'Scientists may classify me as homo
sapiens. I'm not at all, really. I'm a chap from another planet and I've
been sent here as punishment.' He chuckled. 'I'm very much a loner.'
Does loner mean lonely?
'I don't have any close relationships but I deal with quite a lot of
associates. And I find . . . I'm not very fond of myself as a person and I
don't want to sit down and examine my navel and get introspective. So I
work. And I just work. That's it.'
What is it about yourself you don't like, then?
'Goodness knows. Never did.' He gave a nervous laugh. 'A lot of people are
like this. It's a Calvinist thing, an inborn sense of guilt or something.
I've got to work to justify myself, all the time.'
Idleness is the great sin?
'Yes. People say 'what do you do for your leisure?' and I have to think: er
. . . I look on leisure as a sort of retirement on the instalment plan.'
You never wanted to retire and sit in the sun?
'Oh lord, no] I can understand other people doing it, just as I see walruses
doing it on the beach.'
Despite his obvious facility with pencil and brush, Gardner says he never
wanted to be an architect or painter. He disparages architects who consider
themselves intellectuals but forget for whom buildings are built.
What do you mean by intellectuals? 'I put it this way. The world is
populated by two kinds of people: the yakkers or talkers, and the doers. And
I think the talkers can get dominant and then the doing goes wrong - for
example, the Bauhaus in Germany.'
Commercial art was not a poor relation: it just had different objectives.
When he was a student, it was a blossoming industry and art with a capital
'A' was for people with rich uncles or a bit of money.
'I didn't have either. But I've never had an aim to express myself. I'm
given a problem and I try and solve it - a ship or a museum. Give me a blank
bit of canvas and I'm at a loss.'
His secret, he said, is visualisation. 'I've practically got a photographic
memory, to start with. You give me a problem and I can build a model in my
head, almost instantaneously. The whole thing is real in my head, as you
might get in a dream. Then I translate that on to the drawing board.
'When I hit problems of mechanics and technology, I ask experts, or
experience teaches me. Then I'm able to translate it into 3-D again.'
Gardner progressed from advertising and product design to exhibition work.
During the second world war, he translated ticker-tape reports into
battle-scenes for the Daily Express, and then found himself in the deception
and camouflage game building pneumatic tanks, artillery pieces and landing
craft to fool German intelligence, and an exploding bicycle pump to cheer
the French Resistance.
His experience of fairs and exhibitions led to the 'concept museum' of which
he was a pioneer, replacing the traditional glass-case hall with the one-way
circulation system 'where people go in one end and come out with different
ideas at the other'.
Among the many was the Museum of the Diaspora in Tel Aviv and (on a related
theme) the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles. He is most proud of his
national museum of natural science in Taiwan, the story of man's evolution
seen through his (Gardner's) eyes.
But much of his large output had, of its nature, been ephemeral. Did that
make him feel he had wasted his substance?
'Yes, but I think it's as far as one can go in modern society. I don't think
the real is very acceptable. The only time people are interested in the past
is where they go through the portals of a museum. The rest of the time,
they're just running around like rabbits and not really thinking at all.'
Gardner is an individualist, but with two personalities. The one I met
tended to the gloomy. The other, portrayed in his recent autobiography The
Artful Designer, is boisterous, quirky and irreverent.
His father was a travelling salesman in ladies' hats, his mother the Belle
of Tunbridge Wells. She died from a clot on the brain while cutting the
bread for breakfast one morning. The boy was only 14, did not get on with
his stepmother and went out into the world.
He married Mary Williams, a goddess he met behind the counter at Selfridge's
in London's Oxford Street. She was pregnant by a Spanish salesman and 'G'
agreed readily to become her husband, and father to the twin boys. But the
long marriage was dull, he said.
When his wife died, he disposed of the house. What could not be sold or
given away, he heaped into a sacrificial bonfire that lit up the hillside.
In the office and on his travels, he was assisted by a succession of pretty
secretaries named, collectively, 'Mehitabel'.
Despite the book's apparent hints to the contrary, he assured me they were
not mistresses.
I said the book made him sound pleased with himself.
'Oh, that's good. I'm glad to hear that. People have told me it's a very
cheerful book whereas I tend to be, frankly, rather a morose character.
Anyway, I kid myself I am.' It was not black moods, he said, but a tendency
to see half-empty pots where others saw half-full ones.
I asked: where does the moroseness come from?
He pondered. 'I think that I was rather over-idealistic when I was a
youngster. And you find that everything flattens out and things just don't
happen.
'I thought we were going to improve Britain's appreciation of design, but
it's very difficult to get in under the British and change them. They've got
this inertia that goes way back. And it's disappointed me, really. I feel
we're not getting anywhere.
'You ask most people what will happen in their countries in five or 10 years
and they'll give you an answer. But, in England, no one's got a clue. It's
rather a poor show for a nation with our terrific past.'
With the Roman senator and the Japanese samurai, the English Gentleman
('who's quite bogus really: he had to behave because of the servants') was
one of the great creations of history. His taste, manners and literature had
been copied the world over.
'Then two wars partly did it and we went flop. I feel I'm living in a flop
period. That's what makes me slightly sad about things.'
Your book offers no conclusion about your life, I said. What would it be?
'What am I doing here? This complex of electrons and molecules all buzzing
like mad and keeping me up on my two legs. What's it all for?
'There's an over-developed brain which invents a purpose, whereas probably
the football fans have got it right when they sing 'We're here because we're
here because we're here.'
'At the end, all my confreres are either retired or dead and I'm still at
it. So, I rather feel like doing a snook at life and saying 'Anyway, I'm
still doing it.'
'That's about it, actually.'

FT  18 DEC 93 / Rugby award causes Commons ruck: Dominic Lawson finds that
when there are prizes to be handed out, controversy is not far behind
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Mummy,' says Deirdre Rawley to her mother, Lady Mortlake, 'I wish you
wouldn't encourage Michael with his political career. I'd so much rather he
did a job of work]' This characteristic piece of wit from John Osborne's
eminently revivable play, The World of Paul Slickey, came subversively to
mind as I read yesterday's Daily Telegraph.
According to the chronicle of all that is most peculiarly English in the
English way of life, no fewer than 16 members of parliament had signed a
House of Commons motion complaining that the British Broadcasting
Corporation had made England's rugby union players 'team of the year'.
There might be butchery in Bosnia, mass unemployment throughout Europe and a
fascist about to seize control of Russia, but we can trust British MPs to
get agitated about the things which genuinely matter. The motion, drawn up
by Labour members, went on to ask why 'more appropriate contenders' were
overlooked.
Apparently, some of the honourable members felt strongly - the only way in
which they do feel things - that the England World Cup-winning women's
cricket team should have been given greater consideration. Still, I suppose
we should be grateful that the motion was not drafted by loyal Conservative
MPs: they would probably have nominated the Cabinet.
All this, however, paled in comparison to the fuss stirred up in the tabloid
newspapers last week over something called the British Comedy Awards. This
event, held at the Dorchester hotel - how very pleasant - at the end of
November, gave the supreme accolade of 'top TV comedy actor' to Rik Mayall.
But, according to the front pages of several of the UK's most successful
newspapers, the award was a fix.
Mayall's name, they claim, was not even on the shortlist of candidates,
which consisted of people with real names like David and Richard and Michael
and Neil. It was 'a scandal', declared The Sun, and others seemed to agree.
Hardly a week goes by without a public debate over one award or another.
Typically, these awards are made by a group of people in one business to
another in the same line of work. They are simply a good excuse for a large
number of cronies to have a seasonal bash at the Dorchester at somebody
else's expense. Members of the publishing, newspaper and television
industries, masters of the expense account life, are particularly keen on
this sort of thing.
Such events should be of no concern to the public who are, quite reasonably,
excluded from these Masonic gatherings. In the case of the BBC team of the
year award, the business is not even settled by a ballot but decided by
executives. The MPs should mind their own business - or start up their own
award, which they could give to the English women's cricket team.
It is remarkable, though, how steamed up outsiders do get about awards. The
Booker literary prize never manages to create anything less than a full
scale controversy. But it is just a handful of writers trying to do a favour
to a friend in need. The amount of money involved is usually less than the
advance which the winner received for his work, long before it was known to
be any good.
The most lucrative of all the awards, and perhaps the one which started all
the rot, is the Nobel prize. Each of those is worth Pounds 100,000, tax
free. No wonder people become jealous, or outraged. The British complain
bitterly that Graham Greene or Anthony Burgess never won the prize for
literature, and moan incessantly when it is handed to a succession of third
world authors, few of whom write in God's own language.
But why should we care which obscure Egyptian poet was the compromise choice
of a panel of six senile Swedes? If the trustees of the estate of the man
who founded the modern explosives industry wish to spend the income from
Alfred Nobel's bequest in all manner of idiosyncratic ways, let them.
Meanwhile, the UK's elected representatives should find other ways to occupy
their time. I refer back to John Osborne's brilliant play. In answer to
Deirdre's 'I'd so much rather he did a proper job of work]' Lady Mortlake
remarks: 'I suppose he could take a few directorships.' Deirdre: 'But
darling, that wouldn't keep his 'mind' occupied.'

<TEXT>
I feel sorry for the French. I know that will provoke you because nobody on
the planet, so far as I can determine, remotely likes the French. They have
the best country in the world, yet their arrogance and rudeness serve as
insurmountable barriers to anyone who tries to like them.
The reason I feel sorry for the French is that their efforts to protect
their culture from American crap, pap and rubbish are doomed to failure, at
least temporarily. True, the exclusion of films and broadcasting from the
Gatt agreement on world trade liberalisation has been hailed by French
politicians as prefacing victory in their struggle to stop Hollywood's
moguls annihilating Europe's film industry.
But Europe's 'victory' will prove hollow. Eventually, Hollywood will get its
way. Technological developments in the global media marketplace are moving
at such gigantic speed that efforts to preserve 'cultural identity' by
propping up regional film industries will not prevail.
The global village is a reality. As a result, the future is streaming into
our homes and lives in a great sun-burst of particles.
For a while, Hollywood will hold sway. American audio-visual products will
indeed rule the airwaves. Our lives will seem ever more coarse. We may get
quite desperate. And we shall feel immeasurably sad as the French film
industry topples into the gutter.
I love French movies. But I also love Australian movies, Italian movies,
British movies, Spanish movies - movies of wit, distinction and sexiness
from anywhere on earth, Hollywood by no means excluded. I expect I would
even enjoy Welsh movies if that grey little region ever stopped whinging,
actually got its finger out and did something constructive to endear itself
to the rest of us.
In London, according to listings in Time Out magazine, there are 27 American
films on current release against eight British and two French. (I am not
counting co-productions. Orlando, for example, a most enjoyable film, is
listed as a British-Russian-French-Italian-Dutch co-production). The
preponderance of American films on show in London no doubt justifies
film-makers' accusations of US cultural imperialism.
But there is one development to come that, in the fullness of time, will
rescue regional film-making and deal Hollywood a blow. It is this: the
French and all the rest - China, perhaps, excluded - will make their films
in English. They will do this because English is what they will speak.
You don't have to be a genius to see that the main reason why the French at
present capture only the tiniest fraction of ticket sales in US cinemas is
because they film their movies in French. Americans don't speak French. And
they cannot struggle with subtitles.
This is not because they are thick - well, not exclusively because they are
thick - but because cinema audiences in the US cannot be expected to watch
the screen and read subtitles while at the same time consuming immense
quantities of food and Coke.
It shocks me that so many French people do not yet speak English. When did
you last meet a German who did not speak English? Or a Scandinavian? Or a
member of any number of forward-looking nations? When I visited the
Norwegian embassy in London 10 days ago to berate them for their whaling, do
you imagine we spoke Norwegian?
I was confronted by the phenomenon of non-English-speaking French people
last April in Paris when attempting to find my hotel in the middle of the
evening rush-hour. I was sitting in my car - traffic was at a standstill -
when, from a passageway to my right, a Parisian shot out in a large, yellow
Citroen, halting his vehicle only 1.5 mm from the side of my car.
I looked at him aghast. And then I started shouting. 'Have you the remotest
idea what this car is,' I screamed. 'This car is a Rover, a noble and lineal
descendant of the Spitfire aircraft that helped cleanse your skies and save
you from the Hun.
'How dare you hurtle that heap of lemony metal virtually into my side. Are
you completely mad? You look hopelessly mad to me.' I kept this up for three
minutes. Stonily, he stared. It dawned on me that he was equipped with not a
word of English.
The French have got to get real, starting with their movies. They must ditch
their dead language. The sooner they switch to English, the sooner they can
play a role in zapping the Hollywood moguls.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Arts: Where have all the classics gone? - Personalities or
minimalism is what the CD buying public seems to want
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There will be fewer classical CDs among the presents around the Christmas
tree this year. Figures for sales of recorded music included in the PSI's
yearly Cultural Trends, published last week, show trade deliveries of
classical albums have dropped a quarter since 1990 and their market share
down to 9.2 per cent after two years over 10 per cent. Although the
statistics may look discouraging, there is no surprise here. The success of
the World Cup gala with the 'three tenors' - Carreras, Domingo and Pavarotti
 -was a one-off.
What is more interesting is a cultural trend that no statistics can measure.
The public's taste in classical music has changed dramatically in a way that
has implications for the whole industry in the future. To see how, we need
only ask the ghost of Christmas past.
Look at the best-seller lists for the winter of 1973. Karajan had recently
recorded two opera sets, Puccini's La Boheme and Lehar's The Merry Widow.
Both were old favourites aimed at the present-giving season and record shops
as far afield as Glasgow, Leeds, Manchester and London reported brisk sales.
Other records to feature were Previn conducting Rachmaninov's Second
Symphony and a complete set of Beethoven's Piano Concertos played by
Ashkenazy. All good, solid classics.
Now jump ahead 20 years. The profile of what we are buying has changed
beyond recognition. A recent best-sellers list from the HMV record shop
includes all manner of hits. For a start, there are two discs by Cecilia
Bartoli, the young and extremely attractive mezzo, and another by Ute
Lemper, who is only a little way behind in both categories. As it is
unlikely that the public has suddenly formed a craving for arie antiche or
the songs of Kurt Weill, one can safely conclude that the personalities are
the attraction. It cannot be a coincidence that both ladies are familiar
from television. After tasting success with classical artists such as
Pavarotti and Nigel Kennedy, the cannibalistic mass media are on the
look-out for new bodies on which to feed.
This year, however, has been dominated by quite another phenomenon - the
music of Gorecki, Part, Tavener, Nyman and Glass, representing minimalism of
every hue. There is no doubt in my mind that this is a passing fad. But
where has it come from? The mere fact that the classical record industry can
be thrown this way and that by passing fashions like its pop counterpart is
in itself a new phenomenon.
There are people who have not grown up with classical music, but want to
investigate what it might have to offer. Reared on the short attention-span
which is all that is expected by other forms of entertainment today, they
buy discs of compilations ('Essential Opera' or 'Concerto Sampler') and are
attracted by sound-bites on the radio to music that demands no
concentration. Gorecki may be pleading for political tolerance, Tavener and
Part may be searching for religious truth, but that is not why they have
become popular. Their music is easy to absorb. It is culture on a
sugar-lump.
Without the boom in sales during the 1980s caused by the advent of the
compact disc, the choice of music available on recordings would never have
advanced this far. Suddenly record companies could afford to be adventurous.
When Virgin recorded Tavener's The Protecting Veil, nobody could have
predicted its mass appeal. When Elektra-Nonesuch unearthed Gorecki's Third
Symphony, it was a shot in the dark. Gorecki was unknown then. It was
marketing - especially the dissemination of the music through radio,
including the newly-formed Classic FM - that did the trick.
This broadening of the repertoire can be seen on all sides. The popularity
of early music has long spread beyond the university cities and we think
nothing today of finding a set of Venetian Vespers holding its place among
the best-sellers. Names such as Paul McCreesh and the Gabrieli Consort, the
King's Consort, and Trevor Pinnock are regulars in the classical Top 10.
Who would have thought that there was a large market for 20th-century music?
Yet the first-ever recording of Britten's Gloriana has done well this year.
Decca is also said to be enjoying good sales from its 'Entartete Musik'
series, devoted to music banned by the Nazis. Even works by James MacMillan,
Hugh Wood and Harrison Birtwistle turn up on the lists. No wonder BMG has
set up the Catalyst label for young composers and Sony is looking to start
one.
But what is missing here? - the very category that was the mainstay of the
classical best-sellers lists in 1973, the big-name conductor and orchestra
playing the great classics. Record companies are unwilling to discuss in
public the profitability or lack of it enjoyed by their major artists, but
in private some are ready to admit that they have famous conductors and
orchestras on their books that simply do not sell. In the eyes of the
public, the giants of music have died out. As a member of the Berlin
Philharmonic Orchestra remarked to me recently, 'Karajan was the last
tyrannosaurus among conductors'.
In part, it is their success that the present generation of conductors is
having to fight against. If the consumer wants a recording of a Beethoven
symphony, he can still have Karajan or Klemperer, Bohm or Jochum on disc and
 -what is more - at half the price, thanks to the industry's readiness to
repackage old recordings at a discount. That is where the big companies are
making their profit these days. New recordings of the standard classics are
more often than not undertaken in the hope that they will provide similarly
profitable re-issues in the future. Sometimes, the enormous cost of hiring
today's top conductors and orchestras means that the company knows it will
never make a profit on the recording, even before it is finished.
All this must point to ever greater change in the classical consumer's
record-buying habits, ever greater flexibility on the part of record
companies trying to chase those purchases. The need to anticipate the next
passing fad or to light upon the next hit in the right neglected corner of
the repertoire will certainly keep company executives on their toes. What
will be top of the classical charts in 20 years? If only they could ask the
ghost of Christmas future.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Arts: Simply mad Macbeth - Malcolm Rutherford reviews the
new RSC production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Very broadly speaking, there are two ways of playing Macbeth the man. One is
that he is too full of the milk of human kindness to be a natural villain.
He is egged on to dreadful deeds by his ambitious wife. In the end he is 'in
blood stepped so far that, should I wade no more, returning were as tedious
as go o'er.' Thus in the final scenes he fights bravely, rather like Richard
III.
The other is that he is a calculating, ruthless fellow in the first place
and Lady Macbeth is none-too-relevant to his motivations. There is, or
course, a considerable overlap between the two approaches, the main interest
being to which side the actor leans.
In the new production by The Royal Shakespeare Company, Derek Jacobi adds a
third possibility: namely that Macbeth is simply mad. Not mad in the
conventional criminal sense of being a regicide and more, but
psychologically, certifiably insane. If this Macbeth came up in court, a
competent defence counsel might plead that he acted while the balance of
mind was disturbed, and a liberal judge might let him off with a caution.
There is some - not much, but some - evidence in the text for this novel
interpretation. For example, Macbeth sees a dagger before his eyes which
plainly is not there. He sees the ghost of Banquo, invisible to everyone
else. He believes in witches. And here comes the clinching line. When the
forces of good are closing in on Dunsinane, the Scottish nobleman, Caithness
(not one of Shakespeare's most fleshed-out characters), comments on Macbeth:
'Some say he's mad; others, that lesser hate him, do call it valiant fury'.
Adrian Noble, the director, has gone for the 'some say he's mad' view. This
is a fatal mistake, just as it is always dangerous to try to impose a
single, minority interpretation on a Shakespeare play. All the rest of the
evidence is in favour of valiant fury. The only excuse is that Jacobi is
very good at playing madmen.
There are other weaknesses, stemming from a similar genuflexion to academic
theories. A literary critic, Terry Eagleton, has written that 'it is surely
clear that positive value in Macbeth lies with the three witches. The
witches are the heroines of the piece'. Noble has plainly read him. The
witches in this production occupy a huge amount of time. They speak very
slowly and are exceedingly boring.
The slowness is catching. It is quite a feat to make the shortest of
Shakespeare's major plays last for just over three hours. When Jacobi speaks
the famous 'tomorrow' line, it almost seems that the second tomorrow will
never come, let alone the third.
Some other comments. This is the second botched production of Macbeth in
London in the last year or so. Richard Eyre fell down at the Royal National
Theatre by casting a young Lady Macbeth who was not up the part. She was
meant to be the sex kitten behind Macbeth's ambition.
Cheryl Campbell's Lady Macbeth at the Barbican is altogether more mature. If
it were not for the rest of the production, one would say that her
performance is outstanding. Yet if her husband is as mad as she becomes, the
balance is distorted. At times - at the banquet scene, for instance - she
seems the only sane person in the play.
Both Eyre and Noble seem to have a distaste for Scotland. Is it necessary to
present the place as being so full of Stygian, Knoxian gloom? If you can
have glamorous parties in Elsinore, after the death of another king, surely
you can be allowed to live it up a bit north of the Tweed? The most that is
offered here is a dreary Scottish reel, performed in semi-darkness. And the
message is that the Scots, unlike the Danes, do not know how to dress. If
you can make a character out of Osric in Hamlet, it must be possible to
differentiate between the Scottish lords, Lennox, Ross, Menteith, Angus and
Caithness.
Denys Hawthorne's Duncan, clad in a long blue woolly sweater with a
nightshirt underneath, and flowing flaxen hair, adds nothing to the play,
though there is a very good Macduff played by Michael Siberry.
Noble's previous Shakespeare productions for the RSC have been
comprehensively excellent. This is a lapse from which he will recover: even
Newcastle United can't win every week. The result of the Noble/Eyre contest
on Macbeth is a goalless draw: replay soon.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Arts: Cows in the landscape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is something very Dutch about a man who has 'Work is pleasure' painted
above the drawing-room mirror. Hendrik Willem Mesdag (1856-1927) devoted his
life to painting and promoting modern art. His lasting memorial is the
Mesdag Museum in The Hague, the first museum of modern art in the
Netherlands. Mesdag built it beside his house in 1887 as a place where
future generations would find art which was uninhibited by the dead hand of
the academy, a fresh, passionate, celebration of the truth of Nature.
Treasures of the Mesdag Collection, now at the National Gallery of Scotland,
introduces the museum to a wider public.
The exhibition well reflects the strong and particular character of the
Mesdag Museum and its maker. Mesdag started work with the family bank,but at
35 he resolved to give up business for ever. He was set on becoming a
painter, like his wife Sien van Houten and many of their circle. Four years
later, a stormy sea of his won a Gold Medal at the Paris Salon and Mesdag
was launched as the leading Dutch marine artist.
He moved to the Hague to be close to the coast at Scheveningen, where he
loved to paint the horses pulling up the fishermen's boats. When it was
decided to level the dunes to make a resort, the Mesdags were aghast. They
and their artist friends painted the Panorama Mesdag, a 130 metre view of
the coast on the kind of grey, choppy day the Hague School liked best. This
quaint relic of nascent environmentalism can still be visited, although few
people do. The sketch for it is in the exhibition.
Treasures from the Mesdag does not look well in the Edinburgh gallery - the
ceilings are too low and the wall colour is all wrong. However, it makes
perfect sense that in the adjoining room hang the gallery's Daubignys, and
the little Daumier 'Portrait of the Artist', and of course the Van Goghs.
What we see from the Mesdag is, after all, canvasses by many of Van Gogh's
heroes.
As in the Mesdag Collection itself, half the paintings are French 19th
century; Delacroix, Courbet, Daumier ('Neighbours Talking', quite the best
thing), Jules Breton, Millet, two late Corots, and large and boring
landscapes by the Barbizon painters. Perhaps the smallest picture is the
most striking - a Delacroix oil sketch, 'The Evening of the Battle', a dark
and ghastly vision: a lone soldier is the sole living thing of the darkening
plain, gazing out helplessly from between the bloating corpses of two
cavalry horses.
The rest of the paintings are by leading masters of the Hague School; Jacob,
Matthijs and Willem Maris, Jozef Israels, Bosboom, Anton Mauve. One has to
remember that at this period these artists were immensely sought after by
English collectors. Mesdag's heroes were tremendously admired in
progressive, painterly circles in the Netherlands and Britain. Dutch
art-lovers expressed their concern at the flood of canvasses leaving the
country; Mesdag was saving the modernist patrimony.
Clear to see is the great affinity between the Dutch and French painters
whom Mesdag admired. In many cases these artists knew each other. Moreover,
they shared a tremendous respect for the Dutch 17th century masters,
particularly Rembrandt and the landscape painters. The Hague School's
subjects are quintessentially Dutch in their predilection for cows,
seascapes, church interiors, genre scenes such as the feebly comical
'Knitting Lesson' by Gerke Henkes, bonneted children, and portraits of large
and faintly greasy kitchen girls. Seeing the Mesdag in miniature I found a
far from uplifting experience.
It will be several years before the Mesdag Museum reopens. The government
has bought the painter's house and it and the museum are now being restored
to their circa 1900 appearance.
Treasures of the Mesdag Collection is at the National Gallery of Scotland
until February 7 then at the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, until April 10.
It is a National Touring Exhibition organised by the South Bank Centre and
sponsored by BT.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Arts: Jansons sparkles with the LPO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Within a couple of hours of the Arts Council making its final proclamation
on the funding for London's orchestras, the London Philharmonic was taking
its place on the platform at the Royal Festival Hall. The orchestra must
have felt like bringing forward its end-of-season performance of Mahler's
Resurrection Symphony.
In fact, the concert was a modest occasion. Mariss Jansons, since last
autumn Principal Guest Conductor, was in charge of a standard classical
programme, comprising overture, concerto and symphony (almost a rarity these
days). From this concert it would seem that the orchestra has decided to let
him roam further afield than before. Jansons has become so highly regarded
for his interpretation of Russian and Scandinavian music that he has rarely
been allowed to conduct anything else by the London orchestras. Every
concert has featured music from within a few hours' train or boat ride of
his native Latvia; Schubert and Mozart must seem to entail a long journey.
Any fear that he would lose his customary ebullience on the way was quickly
set aside. Schubert's Overture in the Italian style sparkled with
brilliance. Even in Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto it was the conductor
and orchestra who were the focus of attention, rather than the soloist
Mikhail Rudy, who sat amid playing of dramatic fire without the heat seeming
to touch him. The high quality of his musicianship was only partial
compensation.
The Mozart was Symphony No 41, brilliant again in the Jansons manner, while
staying within accepted notions of classical style. The conductor's spruce
handling of orchestral ensemble worked well in this symphony. Under Jansons
a crochet or quaver is just that, never longer, often trimmed slightly
short. When no note is allowed to overlap with another, the effect is of
sharpness and clarity, and every part in Mozart's complex finale was easy to
hear.
In retrospect, it is difficult to imagine how the Arts Council could have
justified starving one or two of London's orchestras of funds. When the LPO
is playing as well as it did for Jansons, it is within reach of the
international standard the bureaucrats crave. Then there is the
Philharmonia, forging exciting artistic alliances, staking a prime place for
itself on the international stage in Paris and Salzburg. Each has made - and
won - its case.

History Now and Then was four discussions by academics on Radio 3, from
Monday to Thursday, on the influence of current beliefs on our approach to
history. 'Now' was not much after the industrial revolution; one piece was
on the Civil War, but with no part for Ian Richardson. Roy Porter chaired.
Monday was People's History, below the kings and battles we all know. A York
excavation told about the food, clothes and health, even pets, of
10th-century folk, not in the history-books. But little about God. In the
late 18th century the people drifted from the Church of England to Dissent;
but what we now have is just 'cultural anthropology', inadequate on, say,
sex. The panel spoke well of EP Thompson's History of the English Working
Class and called for a history 'in depth'.
Tuesday was gender (not sex). Eighteenth-century history is full of Great
Men; women were generally victims or rebels. Good points on political
influence in country houses, and things like tailoring - a man must have
English-style kit to distinguish him from foreigners, while women could wear
French clothes without reproach. A complete history must include all such
things.
Wednesday was school-book history, the Industrial Revolution - not such a
revolution to historians as we had in the last 30 years. The data, as
always, have a male bias; little is told of the changes for women and
children, many of whom went to work. The standard of living from 1750-1850
was constant; height and nutrition were maintained; only later did they
fall. Welfare depended on where one lived; workers in textile industries,
for example, lost out to new items like the Spinning Jenny.
The Civil War on Thursday dealt 100 years further back. Fascinating to know
of the crowd playing football with an executed head at Dorchester; to hear
of the division between Anglicans and the Church of England; but what
concerned the crowds besides playing football with dead heads? Was Charles
II often discussed in the Roundhead kitchens?
Ray Gosling's is a lowbrow academic able to take some everyday thing and
make it interesting. Gosling on the High Street (Radio 4, Wednesdays) picks
a familiar household name and examines its familiarity. Last week we had
Frank Hornby, whose Hornby Trains covered every sitting-room carpet not able
to afford a Bassett-Lowke. This week, Joseph Rowntree, whose sweets have
spread from York around the world.
He was more interesting than Hornby, a mere engineer while Rowntree was a
philanthropist. He worked with drunks in York and wrote a book on social
reform that sold 90,000 copies. He founded three Trusts - for Quakers,
social problems, and a model village where every villager got a garden with
two fruit-trees. The sweet business was taken over by Nestle's, but Terry's
name survives, is indeed his one memorial. 'He would hate a statue,'
grandson Richard Rowntree believes. Next week, travel-king Thomas Cook, also
a philanthropist, though not as keen as his rival Frame, who would make
customers sign a no-drink pledge when they booked their excursion tickets.
Cook thought the drunks themselves would be enough warning against drink.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Arts: Comedy turns Establishment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
It has been a funny year. In the old days anyone who forced you into a
corner and then went on and on about nose hair, the problem with Lycra
underpants, and their traumas with contact lenses, would have been locked
away. Now they are given their own television show.
The era of 'alternative' comedy is over: monologues about the horrors of
modern living, and stream of consciousness outpourings on flared trousers,
have captured the mainstream: this brand of humour no longer needs a
qualifying adjective. With the new breed of comedians sweeping the awards at
last weekend's televised comedy prize giving while Newman and Baddiel were
almost filling Wembley Arena; with Paul Merton playing the Palladium for two
weeks in the spring and Ben Elton available in movie, book, video, theatre
and TV, this particular comic bandwagon is on a seemingly unstoppable high.
The nation is desperate for a laugh.
The man with prime responsibility for this shift in popular taste is Don
Ward. In 1979 he converted a room above a strip club in Soho's Dean Street
into a comedy club. It was a popular idea in the US, but new to the UK. The
club flourished, and moved to Leicester Square. On Monday the Comedy Store
moved again, into expanded premises around the corner in Oxendon Street. As
Paul Merton said at the opening cabaret, 'Comedy Store 3: This Time its
Serious'.
In the 14 years virtually every big-name comedian has received their break
at the Comedy Store. Ben Elton, Alexei Sayle, French and Saunders, Rick
Mayall, Sean Hughes, Julian Clary: the list is endless. Many appeared in
public for the first time at one of the open spots on Thursday night when
three strangers get the chance to die for five minutes. If they survive they
might get a paid booking a month or so later when they have worked up a
longer set. After that a TV show, perhaps after winning the Perrier Comedy
Award at the Edinburgh Fringe, is a formality.
Many of the most successful graduates turned up last Monday at the Comedy
Store to usher in the new era. It is pointless to deny that comedians, like
beauty queens, are hit and miss affairs. The funniest people, like the
prettiest girls, prefer to blush unseen: egomaniacs with a propensity
towards manic depression are the first to leap on to the stage. It is
extraordinary how gauche and uncomfortable even seasoned comics can be when
put on the spot of entertaining a capricious audience. 'I've not done a solo
spot for 15 months', said Nick Revell, before wriggling prematurely from the
stage on Monday. Simon Fanshawe failed to win over the audience and left
even more quickly.
But despite the sad joes, who somehow, in this uncritical business, achieve
premier league status, the first show in the new Comedy Store was a jolly
occasion. Sight lines are better; the 400 seats give a sense of space with
no loss of intimacy; the location is ideal: Don Ward expects to be there for
25 years, in which time he could have satellite Comedy Stores around the
country, perhaps on the continent. Ward, watching his proteges make
millions, is belatedly attempting to cash in. And the successful comedians
still return regularly to the Store to try out new material in return for a
modest share of the gate.
The heroes on Monday were the three comperes - Jo Brand ('no chocolate in
it, no point: that's what I say'); Julian Clary ('Man About the Heath'); and
Arthur Smith, who jollied things along by wearing a Lycra Superman outfit
with fitted accessories. Among the stars were Eddie Izzard, who for 10
minutes made washing powders seem the funniest thing on earth; John Hegley,
with a poetic pean in favour of spectacles; Hattie Hayridge, who, along with
Jo Brand, has confirmed the wit in women; Jack Dee, with well received new
material, and Paul Merton, with equally acclaimed old material. Merton had
polished up the policeman sketch which marked his Comedy Store debut around
a decade ago.
These comedians are now the Establishment, roaring into their 30s, and,
through the expansion of media into videos and niche publishing, making
money faster than old Tarbie or Brucie could ever have imagined. What we
need now to keep them on their toes is a new generation of comedians with
the ability to lift their material above personal idiosyncracies to embrace
a broader imaginative world. They might even consider reviving that almost
forgotten art form, the well rounded joke.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Arts: Requiem for Wildlife
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thursday's Royal Festival Hall Verdi Requiem was given by the Philharmonia
Orchestra and Chorus for the benefit of the World Wildlife Fund. The
conductor, Lorin Maazel, had both donated his fee and written an eloquent
preface to the programme. This worthwhile pursuit should be saluted; what a
pity it was not possible also to salute the behaviour of the frequently
restless, chatty, cough-rackety 'gala audience' - nor, in truth, the quality
of the Verdi performance itself: the gap between noble aim and trivial
execution yawned wide.
As so often in the past, when he has conducted this work (and others of
similarly large scale) in London, it was hard to avoid constant focus on the
extraordinary superficiality of Maazel's music-making. He is, after all, a
paid-up member of the world's conducting elite; his facility of technique,
speed of musical absorption and general breadth of command remain the stuff
of legend.
So the externalised, showpiece effects drawn out of the score - absurdly
self-conscious extremes of dynamic, vulgar underlinings of brass-and-drum
drama, lashings of 'feeling' applied to the passages of quiet sentiment and
heartfelt pleading - stuck out altogether more than they might in a reading
by a conductor with less directorial savoir-faire. There were a few blips of
ensemble between the offstage brass and the main orchestra; for the rest,
and with the above reservations firmly in mind, the playing and choral
singing were representative of the Philharmonia's celebrated Verdi Requiem
best.
There was an odd, mismatched team of soloists - odder even than originally
planned, since Claire Powell, the lightweight but very musical mezzo, came
in as a last-minute replacement. The lowest voice belonged to Glyndebourne's
mighty Porgy and Bess Crown, Gregg Baker, and sounded here secure but
resolutely unidiomatic. The young Frenchman Roberto Alagna, hotly tipped as
the world's 'next' tenor star, will surely wanted to forget this occasion,
and the amount of erratic, out-of-tune delivery he contributed thereto, as
soon as possible.
It was left to Nina Rautio - a Russian soprano spinto of grandly impassioned
authority, rich-grained in tone, only occasionally uncomfortable in changes
of gear - to convey an authentic sense of Verdian style and content
otherwise very largely obliterated.

FT  18 DEC 93 / Arts: Identity crisis in the Euro-movies - Nigel Andrews
explains why it is becoming more and more difficult to tell European and
Hollywood films apart
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
History had been made. The world's future was open for business. But the
American with the punchdrunk tie and eyes bright with sleep-deprivation
leaned into the microphone for one parting shot. 'You cannot sustain a
functioning democracy,' he rasped, 'and control what people see, what they
view, and what they hear. We will fight that forever]'
Swell of music. Track out from press-conference table. Roll end credits.
If not in pre-production already, Gatt The Movie surely soon will be: with
Dustin Hoffman as Mickey Kantor and Sir Peter Ustinov as Sir Leon Brittan.
The world loves movies about the movie business, and the final stages of the
Uruguay Round turned out to be nothing but movies. 'Audio-visuals' was the
swank term in the near-interminable squabble about whether Europe should
drop its protectionist stance towards its film/TV industry or America bow to
the exceptional status of 'culture' in trade negotiations.
Years ago - let us flashback to the formative prehistory of this debate -
culture and European cinema really did seem homonymous terms. We who grew up
through the 1950s and '60s remember the rituals. On with the school scarves.
Out with the bikes. Off to the local arthouse - every town had one - for the
latest Bergman, Fellini or Godard.
There on screen, in glorious monochrome, medieval knights and tortured
artists and existential French prostitutes scrimmaged about among the great
questions of life and death. This was cinema as secular sacrament. Even our
eyes mimicked genuflection by flicking down, every three nanoseconds, to the
English subtitles.
Europe back then was art, Hollywood was entertainment. There was no enmity
between the two kingdoms because each offered a different dispensation. But
since then a growing crisis of identity and confidence has hit continental
cinema. It was discernible long before Gatt Round 7, in the emergence of a
perverse quasi-colonial rapprochement of style between EC and US cinema.
Put simply: for the last ten years we have had a hard time telling European
and Hollywood films apart. All those clonable Euro-movies snapped up for US
remakes like The Vanishing and Three Men And A Baby. All those glossy,
Tinseltown-influenced directors like Jean-Jacques (Diva) Beineix, Luc
(Nikita) Besson and Pedro (Women On The Verge Of A Nervous Breakdown)
Almodovar.
Worse still, it is hard to think of any indisputably great film-maker at
work on the continent today. Giants with fiercely individual visions born
out of individual cultures - the ultra-Italian Fellini (carnivals, high
living), the hyperbolically Swedish Bergman (suicide, religion, rocky
islands) - seem extinct, leaving the landmass to talented, variable mortals
who move like travelling salesmen from country to country, co-production to
co-production.
Even the most respected and individualistic directors today are condemned to
this itinerant way of life. Poland's Krszystof Kieslowski made his last two
feature films in France; Frenchman Bertrand Tavernier's last film was a
bilingual Franglais production starring Dirk Bogarde; and Italy's Bernardo
Bertolucci (The Last Emperor) and Germany's Wim Wenders (Wings Of Desire)
shoot all over the world from Morocco to China, New York to New Guinea.
Wenders, who occasionally doubles back to Berlin to make movies about those
stateless beings called angels, is fully aware of this new nomadic movie
Europe - and of the scant room it has for a cinema of national flag-waving.
'These individual cultures,' he told me, 'these film 'nations' as they once
were, must face the fact that they can only preserve some of their identity,
their national feeling, if they subordinate it under the banner of Europe. I
don't think we can much longer pretend you're making a 'German' or 'French'
or 'Italian' film. Those notions will have to be given up. We're going to
have to believe in a 'European' cinema, where local stories can be told
under a common roof.'
Even if not suffering a multiple identity crisis, Europe is experiencing a
painful rite of passage. So can the soothsayers of EC culture be right in
suggesting that if we took Hollywood out of the equation, French, German,
Italian film-makers and the rest would bounce straight back to peak health?
After all US directors frequently remake films conceived in Europe, but the
Europeans never remake US productions. Still, they might if they had the
money.
The anti-Hollywoodites pick out the following notifiable evils. They
(Hollywood) make films that are high on hardware, low on human insight. And
their movies are like a factory product: fashioned according to public
demand by a multiple workforce, including teams of screenwriters, umpteen
producers and even the sneak preview audiences whose scorecards can send a
film back for last-minute fine-tuning. But why, if Hollywood is so
philistine/unfeeling/mechanistic in its approach to cinema does it keep
being attracted to European films?
''Because we are the opposite]' says Jaques Fansten, the French director
whose sentimental hit, Cross My Heart, was snapped up by Stephen Spielberg.
'American film-makers say, You're lucky in Europe because you can still make
films that are personal] In Hollywood they have 20, 30, 50 people who have a
say in how the film is made.' But could the two industries live together?
That must be difficult so long as Europe buys half of all American
production and America buys some 1 per cent of films and TV shows from the
EC . . . Despite claims that American distributors exercise excessive market
power, this imbalance also reflects European moviegoing taste.
The other big worry is about cultural imperialism. France's best-known
director, Bertrand Tavernier says: 'It is a terrifying danger. America can
impose on Europe a whole way of making movies. On public TV in France,
practically one-third of programmes are in English.'
That, surely, is the fault less of Hollywood than of the destabilising
effect of the break-up of individual European cultures under the impact of
EC 'unity'. But show a Frenchman a glimmer of transatlantic input and he
suspects conspiracy.
'America takes film seriously,' says Tavernier, 'not just because it is a
big industry, but because it sells a way of life. They know cinema is a
vehicle for ideas, and they want to sell those ideas over the world. The
Americans take cinema, and the propaganda power of images, very seriously.'
So we are back to Coca-Cola and McDonalds. But even if Europe dislikes this
Goliath, and his tendency to wield soft drinks monopolies in one hand,
spiked club in the other, what in a free world can our Continental David do?
'We must have strict rules] But after all this is the lesson of American
cinema. When you see all those Westerns, when you see films like Man Without
A Star, where you have fights between the homesteaders and the big cattle
baron, they always want to put up barbed wire to protect their 'culture.'
And the cattle baron says, 'This is a free country, my cattle can go
wherever they want, especially across your land to get to the river.' And
the people say, 'Build a road]' But he won't build a road. So the people
bring in Kirk Douglas to fight the cattle baron. That is what we need in
Europe. We need Kirk Douglas (passionate Tavernier chuckle) to help us]'
And the world needs Hollywood to start marshalling its arguments in a
propaganda war that Europe is fast turning in its own favour, questioning
and re-defining terms like 'free market' and 'protectionism' as it does so.
Is there a cattle baron in the house?

FT  18 DEC 93 / Arts: Arts Council saves face with a stroke of genius - Off
the Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Have they got away with it? Will the men who masterminded the biggest
debacle in the famously accident prone Arts Council survive in their jobs?
It looks like it. On Wednesday the Council ignored the evidence of Sir
Leonard Hoffmann's committee into the funding of the London orchestras;
disregarded the advice of its own music department, and decided that all
four orchestras should receive support in 1994-95 miraculously close to
their grants in the current year. The Council's long cherished dream of two
super orchestras in London matching in quality the best of Vienna and Berlin
goes on ice - at least for another few years.
But the solution was a stroke of genius. An absence of victims made it a
non-story for the blood-seeking media, and the orchestras were so relieved
that, with the exception of the hard done by Philharmonia, they turned into
pussycats. Months of turmoil and heartache, of indecision and double
dealing, to say nothing of defence costs of at least Pounds 100,000
accumulated by the three orchestras in the firing line, have come to
nothing. At least Anthony Everitt, secretary general of the Arts Council,
had the grace to say that the orchestras might receive compensation for
their trouble.
Lord Palumbo, chairman of the Council, could be indicted for pushing the
super orchestra idea beyond the call of duty; Anthony Everitt, for
pretending to be the innocent messenger between the Council and the music
panel; Ken Baird, head of music at the Council, for allowing his
recommendation that money should be switched from the LPO to the
Philharmonia to be over-ruled by the Council; and Bryan Magee, head of the
music panel, for allowing his colleagues to break ranks, resign, leak to the
press, and generally behave like musicians.
There is one other man who must be lighting candles this weekend: Nicholas
Snowman, director of the South Bank Centre, who was languidly ticked off by
Sir Leonard for pushing too hard for the LPO, the resident orchestra at the
Centre, in his evidence to the Committee. It could be that Hoffmann came
out, marginally, in favour of funding the Philharmonia at the expense of the
LPO because of such pressure. If the Arts Council had gone with the
Philharmonia, as it was morally bound to do, Snowman would have been in an
impossible position, with an under-funded resident orchestra with a locked
in five year contract, and the prospect of coming to terms with the
Philharmonia, with which it has strained relations.
One thing has been gained: an excellent report by Sir Leonard Hoffmann into
the London music scene, which is available, gratis, from the Arts Council,
to anyone interested. The report contains some depressing details. The LPO,
the Philharmonia and the Royal Philharmonic all have worrying deficits; the
South Bank, the main London showcase for all three, is suffering from a
serious decline in its audience for orchestral music, from an average paid
attendance of 81 per cent in 1970-71 to 60 per cent in 1992-93. Any
dispassionate observer might say there are too many orchestras in London;
perhaps the Arts Council should look into the matter.
But, despite the ironies, the final messy compromise is probably the least
damaging. Everyone knows that, most nights, there is nothing to choose
between the playing quality of the four orchestras (adding in the LSO at the
Barbican). Subsidy is a small and declining part of their income. Let the
market place decide their future. This week end the RPO can celebrate the
prospect of Pounds 500,000 in sponsorship support from Classic FM; the
Philharmonia, the public acknowledgement that, along with the LSO, it is
perhaps London's premier orchestra; and the LPO its confirmation as resident
at the South Bank, with funding intact. The Arts Council hardly deserves
such a happy result.
There was little merriment at the antique dealers' parties this week.
Flamboyant gallery owner Roy Miles for once summed up the general mood: 'we
are entering the final death throes of the London art market'. Yet the cause
of this gloom, the imposition, at last, of VAT on works of art imported into
the UK from non-EC countries, had been hailed by the other half of the
market, the auctioneers, as a minor triumph. 'The net effect of these new
proposals is minimal' oozed Christie's. 'We are pleased the present
uncertainty has ended', adds Sotheby's.
On the surface the imposition of VAT at 2 1/2 per cent is scarcely lethal.
Christie's was quick to produce a table which showed that an imported item
from Australia, say, or the US, which sold for Pounds 100,000 in the auction
room, would now cost the buyer Pounds 770 more. The levelling of VAT on the
gross price produces an extra cost just marginally higher than the previous
payment, which included 17.5 per cent levied on the buyer's premium: the
final price would be Pounds 114,287 as against Pounds 113,512. A non-EC
buyer who then exports the antique outside the EC would actually pay less
since he could get a VAT refund.
The auction houses says the dealers are crying wolf. They have been given a
valuable lollipop in an extension from six months to two years in the
imposition of the tax. If a gallery importing, say, a painting from New York
sells it to a collector outside the EC within two years there is no VAT. The
big dealers have galleries in the US so if they are unable to find a buyer
within two years the picture can be exported to the sister gallery with no
tax burden.
Of course the real worry is that after five years the VAT will be raised to
5 per cent or more. This is the genuine concern of the dealers. The
government has it in its power, at minimal cost, to make things easier for
them. They have to accept an EC imposed import tax for the first time, but
they still pay 17 1/2 per cent VAT on works of art painted since 1973 while
dealers in EC countries pay around 5 per cent. Reducing VAT to the EC level
would give a great fillip to contemporary art and provide the dealers with
hope for the future.
The UK's oldest public picture gallery, at Dulwich, has secured its future
by getting an aimable divorce from its previous Trustees, the governors of
Dulwich College and Alley's School, and gaining an impressive new board,
headed by Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover and including the generous, and
rich, Mrs Vivien Duffield and Christopher Brown, chief curator of the
National Gallery.
The new board is seeking an endowment of Pounds 5m-Pounds 8m. This will
ensure that the Gallery no longer suffers from a persistent annual shortfall
in revenue of around Pounds 200,000. It will also enable it to open at lunch
time, improve the lighting, promote itself, and, eventually, build on a
cafe, and space for temporary exhibitions.

THE FABER BOOK OF MOVIE VERSE edited by Philip French and Ken Wlaschin Faber
Pounds 20, 450 pages
Can this really be 'the first collection of its kind' as the flyleaf boasts?
The words 'poetic' and 'cinema' have been going steady now for almost a
hundred years. But then as the book's co-editor, The Observer film critic
Philip French, points out in his preface, verse about the movies probably
constitutes the slimmest of the half-dozen categories in which the two big
concepts - Poem and Film - interact.
There are 'poetic' movies (John Ford, Dovzhenko, David Lean). There are
movies by poets (Cocteau, Pasolini) and about poets (Fredric March as
Browning, Richard Chamberlain - heaven help us - as Byron). There are movies
quoting poetry or titled after it (Gone With The Wind). There are even
movies based on verse plays (Key Largo, Winterset), though Hollywood ensured
that not much of the verse remained by the time Humphrey Bogart or Burgess
Meredith moseyed into view.
Yet amid all this crossbreeding there seem to be few instances of poets  -
or well-known ones - serenading the screen. This book is a pleasure and a
provocation: not just for its revelation that many bards over many decades
have hewn serious thoughts about cinema. But the range and wit of the
entries surprises too. In a Cinemascopic arc of mood from satire to sober
philosophising, from terse haikus to logorrheic lampoons, we find a poetic
language not vulgarised but enriched by movie terms and argot. Witness
'Hollywood Jabberwocky' in which screenwriter IAL Diamond, Billy Wilder's
longtime collaborator, brings the spirit of Lewis Carroll to Lotusland:
'Twas ciros, and the cinelords Were lollyparsing with their babes: All
goldwyns were acadawards But demille rules the nabes. 'Beware the
Jarthurank, my lad]'. . .
And so on, niftily, neologistically. (Keep the footnotes handy to discover
that 'lollyparsing' refers to gossip columnist Louella Parsons and 'ciros'
to a Tinseltown nightclub.)
Wordplay is one response to cinema and its challenges for the poet. Other
practitioners prefer the monosyllables of gnomic irony. Daniel Hoffman
tartly addresses the Dream Factory's fleeting love affairs with Innocence -
'In the days of Rin-Tin-Tin/ There was no such thing as sin'. Irish
film-maker Neil Jordan wittily versifies his first encounter with Hollywood
back in 1985, when he pitched his ill-fated comedy project High Spirits -
'they ask why it's not like your last/ you tell them that emotion's past'.
And WH Auden in 'I Am Not A Camera' skins his language back to Savonarolan
spareness to conclude, at the end of three censorious stanzas, that 'The
camera may/ do justice to laughter, but must/ degrade sorrow.'
Auden's poem is enrolled in the most ambitious of the book's five sections,
'Movies As Metaphor.' Other headings include 'The Silent Cinema,'
'Hollywood,' 'Films And Genres' and 'TV And The Afterlife Of Movies'. Movie
as metaphor fills one with dread and this section is the most pompous and
unconvincing. 'Last night/ I played Kirk Douglas to/ Your Burt Lancaster'
starts one poem that does not tempt one to read further. Another, drawing
itself for a full fantasy/reality think-session: 'Can this, the world we see
today, be real?'
Attacks of solemnity are not absent from other parts of the book. We might
have guessed that a slew of 1960s poets would gather around Harpo Marx to
hymn his Christly, sad-clown, pre-Flower Power charisma. They are John Wain,
Jack Kerouac and Robert Lowell. And ASJ Tessimond makes short work of
Charlie Chaplin's idiomatic humanism by turning him into a cautionary
hieroglyph for all mankind: 'God kicks us in the pants and sets banana-skins
on stairs . . .'
In a good poem, as in a good movie, power comes from the particular. Nearly
all the best verse in this book grows from the casual passion of the viewing
experience itself. It can be Carol Ann Duffy finding that her memory of a
friend is enmeshed in the memory of their joint TV viewing of Now, Voyager.
Or it can be Michael Ondaatje's wonderful 'Late Movies With Skyler,' where a
midnight re-viewing of The Prisoner Of Zenda prompts some blithe, wry
philosophising on heroes and destinies. Watching Stewart Granger's hero
vanish from the zone of narrative certainty at the film's close, Ondaatje
suspects he is merely joining the rest of us in that great formless
playground we call Life:
In the movies of my childhood the heroes after skilled swordplay and moral
victories leave with absolutely nothing to do for the rest of their lives.
Ondaatje knows what makes popular movies so appealing. They provide our
lives with passing paroxysms of action and reaction, evildoing and
dering-do, purpose and message: after which we and the heroes head back into
the routine sunsets and sunrises of our lives - not disappointed, but
renewed in our relish for their subtler, quieter, more haphazard
eventfulness.

THE HIDDEN LANDSCAPE by Richard Fortey Jonathan Cape Pounds 19.99, 310 pages
I know next to nothing about geology - my only acquaintance with fossils
comes from The French Lieutenant's Woman - and I had never thought to give
the matter my attention. This book shows me to be a fool. I have read The
Hidden Landscape in a state of sustained fascination, and commend it to all
the other fools out there.
Richard Fortey's theme is the connection between the geology of the British
Isles and our landscape: he shows how today's beautiful, diverse and
threatened countryside is the result of events that took place unimaginable
millions of years ago. It is, he says, 'a book about connections between
geology, natural history, and ourselves. The intention is to inspire a way
of looking at the landscape . . .'
This is not, I suggest, a book to be read at a single sitting - it is too
rich, too dense, for that. Rather it should join Pevsner and Hoskins and
Rackham, if not in the car at least on the shelf below the Barbours and
above the wellingtons. (It is a pity that the index is not quite full
enough, since you will frequently want to look up place names from your
travels.) I am not remotely qualified to say so, but I suspect we have here
a new classic.
We start in the North-Western Highlands of Scotland and finish on the
fast-eroding shores of East Anglia. Like all geologists, Fortey is a bit of
a nut, and certainly a romantic: when he gets behind the gasworks in
Haverfordwest, cracks a rock in two and discovers a trilobite, 'there was
astonishment in suddenly finding this complex creature, so perfect though so
old, with a pair of petrified eyes visible to the naked eye even in the
misty light of a Welsh afternoon, eyes that had last seen the world more
than 400 million years ago - before the first, humble liverwort had
colonised the dampest shore, before sharks, before flies, and how
unimaginably far before humankind'.
There you have a reminder of the time factor. This is not a book for
Fundamentalists: the Earth is 4,600 million years old - 'one of those
immutable facts that should be filed in the mind, along with the date of The
Battle of Hastings and The French Revolution'. Britain apparently contains
as great a variety of rocks in a small area as anywhere in the world, and
Richard Fortey rolls back the skin of vegetation and buildings so as to lay
bare the hidden landscape that has shaped our nation and its character. (In
a typical aside he cannot resist quoting Catherine in Wuthering Heights: 'My
love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath - a source of little
visible delight, but necessary'.) This is popular science at its best; it is
beautifully written, constantly witty, and excellently illustrated.
The language is certainly accessible to the layman. Consider, for instance,
the tiny agnostids - 'Blows have been exchanged over the question whether
agnostids are or are not really trilobites. They have been thought of as
Cambrian parasites or, more plausibly, as Cambrian plankton . . . They
changed through time, so just by looking at these little enigmatica the
expert can tell what part of the Cambrian the fossils come from. This is
practically useful in tracing correlative beds from one part of the country
to another, or even throughout the world. Some of the same agnostids that
lurk in the cliffs at St Davids's are found in Sweden, China, Australia,
even Siberia. I once had a visitor from Kazakhstan whose command of English
was rudimentary, but we got on perfectly well by merely exchanging smiles
and the names of agnostids . . .'
That illustrtes the style of an engaging book. There is no particular
thesis: this is a journey around the British Isles, describing, explaining,
analysing, digressing, making clear many things we may never have taken time
to consider.
The range of Fortey's enthusiastic scholarship seems limitless: he talks in
passing about the quality of bottled mineral water, the Moine Thrust, the
Loch Ness monster, cream teas, Gerard Manley Hopkins' 'dappled things', the
'grass of Parnassus' on Lindisfarne, DH Lawrence's ambivalent response to
coalfields, the Cheshire salt industry and its origins, pargetting, the
importance of Welsh slate and Portland stone for British architecture, the
demise of truffle hunting, elephant fossils in East Anglia, the true extent
of the Ice Age, the peat industry in the 14th-century Norfolk Broads, the
nature of (real) amber, the link between churchwarden pipes and lip cancer,
the fact that 'on the summit of Mount Everest there are Ordovician fossils
really quite like those from North Wales' . . .
And so on and so forth.

The sight of 1,000 children's books clamouring for our attention in a medium
size bookshop is almost as maddening and confusing as the sight of 1,000
children clamouring for our attention in that same bookshop. So call them
all to order and group them strictly in lines - with the youngest first, of
course.
The most pictorially ravishing picture book is undoubtedly The Children of
Lir by Sheila MacGill-Callaghan (Ragged Bears, Pounds 8.99), a story loosely
based on an Irish legend that may have been one of Shakespeare's sources for
King Lear. When Lir's wife, Aiofe, witnesses the affection the king shows
his children, she changes them all into swans and the conditions that need
to be fulfilled if they are to regain their human forms seem beyond the
reach of mere human ingenuity. The book's Russian illustrator, Gennnady
Spirin, has an exuberant touch  - his dolphins leap out of the waves at us,
and his birds beat their wings in a baroque frenzy. All this marvellous
colourwork helps us to forgive the book's author for a diction that leans
too heavily at times on archaic locutions.
Other outstanding picture books for the under-sixes this autumn include Too
Tired by Ann Turnbull (Hamish Hamilton, Pounds 8.99; illustrated by the
excellent Ella Chichester Clark), in which the slothful behaviour of two
sloths makes Noah's job of filling the Ark with two of everything before it
gets too late almost impossibly difficult; The Beast with a Thousand Teeth
by the elderly Python Terry Jones (Pavilion, Pounds 6.00; illustrated by
Michael Foreman), in which too many cakes topped by pink icing destroy a
heartless beast's hopes of using his magnificent teeth to gobble up an
entire community; and The Snow Angel by Angela McAllister and award-winning
illustrator Claire Fletcher (Bodley Head, Pounds 8.99). Elsa lies down in
the snow and makes the shape of an angel with her outstretched arms. The
impression (like her own fantasy of turning into a snow angel) does not go
away.
Finding a new theme for an anthology of children's poetry is always
extremely difficult - pets have been flogged to death; witches are looking
increasingly threadbare. One anthologist who always seems to have the
capacity to spring a pleasant surprise is Anne Harvey. He Said, She Said,
They Said (Blackie, Pounds 9.99) is a collection of poems written in the
form of conversations - from Auden's marvellous ballad 'Oh, What is that
Sound?' to the traditional 'Oh] Soldier, soldier, won't You Marry Me?' Like
novels written in the first person, poems spoken in individual voices
arguing, teasing, complaining or merely enquiring, have a special capacity
to surprise and delight. The unexpected interjection heightens the dramatic
effect at every twist and turn.
Another new anthology worth recommending is Funny Bunch (Viking, Pounds
8.99), a collection of comic poems edited by the excellent children's poet
Kit Wright. Wright has done his homework as an anthologist. He does not
plunder the best of his material from other people's anthologies - the
oldest trick of the anthologist's trade.
Of the new novels of children of six to eight, Akimbo and the Crocodile Man
(Methuen, Pounds 6.99) by the prolific Alexander McCall Smith is the third
in a sequence of novels about a young African boy who goes on safaris. The
moments of excitement are worked for; there is no gratuitous
sensationalising. Jenny Nimmo's The Stone Mouse (Walker, Pounds 6.99) is a
short, taut novel told from an unusual perspective - that of a stone mouse
who has to tolerate the tiresome attentions of holiday visitors to his
seaside home.
Anne Merrick has taken for the subject matter of her first novel for older
children the difficult and challenging problem of a child who has lost its
memory and is trying to reconstruct, step by painful step, a new reality for
itself. This could have been merely a worthy book; in fact, Someone Came
Knocking (Spindlewood, Pounds 9.95) is an extremely powerful and engrossing
one from start to finish. Susan Price, who won the Carnegie Medal in 1987
for The Ghost Drum, is very good at retelling traditional fairy stories,
giving them new setting and unexpected meanings. Her latest book, Head and
Tales (Faber, Pounds 9.99) mines a similar vein. Lynnet the storyteller, an
old man in the grip of a fever, makes a macabre request: that his head
should be cut off, wrapped in rags and delivered by his own children to
their grandmother's distant home. It seems a near impossible task until the
head opens its mouth and starts to spin some grisly yarns of its own.
Finally, a collection of stories for children that is likely to appeal as
much to parents as to their sophisticated young. The Oxford Book of
Children's Stories (Oxford, Pounds 17 .95), edited by the excellent
children's novelist Jan Mark, is a collection of some of the best short
stories written for children over the past 250 years, beginning with Sarah
Fielding's 'Story of Celia and Chloe' of 1749; passing through contributions
by such writers as George MacDonald, Louisa May Alcott, Jean Ingelor and
Christina Rossetti; and concluding with work by some of the editor's own
contemporaries - James Berry, Anne Fine (winner of this year's Carnegie
Medal for The Flour Babies) and Phillipa Pearce. What insights the
collection gives into the historical development of writing for children] -
the most interesting of all being the fact that the ingredients for a
successful children's story have remained remarkably constant down the
years. Everything changes, everything remains the same.
