FT  20 OCT 93 / Bundesbank says derivatives pose threat to world markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK today warns that the growth of derivatives markets could
endanger the stability of the world financial system.
In its monthly report, the German central bank argues that the increase in
the use of options, futures and other complex derivative instruments has led
to an interlinking of the world's financial markets that makes them more
'vulnerable to crisis'.
The Bundesbank's concerns echo fears voiced last year by other leading
regulators, including Mr Gerald Corrigan, then president of the New York
Federal Reserve Board.
However, recent reports, including one by the Bank of England, have adopted
a more conciliatory tone.
Derivatives are financial instruments whose value is based on underlying
assets, such as a currency, interest rate or share price. The Bundesbank
calculates such transactions for German banks alone totalled DM6,116bn
(Pounds 2,490bn) in mid-1993, which is the equivalent of 90 per cent of the
balance sheets of the entire German banking sector.
The notional amount of futures contracts traded on the world's exchanges
every year has reached Dollars 140,000bn (Pounds 92,710bn), while the
notional outstanding amount of swaps (contracts entered directly between
banks) is about Dollars 4,500bn.
In today's report the Bundesbank recognises the positive aspects of
derivatives - that they can be used to hedge risks and allow banks and
companies more flexibility. But it warns that the collapse of a leading
market participant or extreme market turbulence could set off a 'chain
reaction', whereby problems in the derivatives markets could prompt a
liquidity crisis in the cash markets and endanger the whole financial
system.
'Such developments can only be avoided if all market participants are aware
not just of all the ways in which such instruments can be deployed, but also
of the risks attached to using them,' the Bundesbank says.
The central bank warns against 'fair-weather' risk and control mechanisms
for derivatives business. And it suggests ways of mitigating the risks.
Market participants should improve their risk recognition systems, and
disclosure requirements should be improved so that banks cannot hide much of
such business 'off balance-sheet', the Bundesbank says.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Survey of Bermuda (1): Embracing a new realism - The
importance of offshore investment and insurance has been growing following a
recent decline in the tourist industry which is suffering from recession in
the US. But Richard Lapper finds that this is just one of many developments
being witnessed by the island's business community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM his office overlooking the yachts in Hamilton's picturesque harbour,
Charles Vaughan-Johnson, who next year takes over as president of Bermuda's
biggest bank, unfolds a map of the world showing thick red lines linking the
tiny Atlantic island to New York and London.
The map is published by Cable and Wireless, the telecommunications giant,
and the lines represent the digital communications 'highway' which links the
island to the world's financial centres and is a crucial element in the
success of Bermuda's offshore investment and insurance business.
'It enables us to do the things which depend on high-speed electronic
communication,' says Mr Vaughan-Johnson, whose bank already has eight
overseas offices and has recently expanded its trust business in East Asia.
Mr Vaughan-Johnson believes that the Cable &amp; Wireless communications lines
now equal if not outweigh the importance of the sea and aircraft links on
which Bermuda's tourist industry - and economic welfare - has traditionally
depended.
In Bermuda's business community he is not alone. Following the election
victory earlier this month of the United Bermuda Party (UBP), the immediate
future of international business appears assured.
Over the past three years under the UBP government of Sir John Swan,
the premier, the offshore sector has grown and now accounts for about 50
per cent of Bermuda's foreign exchange earnings.
To a degree this reflects the decline of the tourist industry, the island's
traditional economic mainstay, which has suffered from the recession in the
US, the island's main market.
Arrivals fell by about one sixth between 1987 and 1992. The island's big
hotels have steadily lost money and local retailers and other trades largely
dependent on tourists have shed staff, contributing to a rise in
unemployment to about 5 per cent of the workforce.
Partially to compensate for this decline, the government has promoted the
offshore investment, trust and insurance industries, partially through more
active marketing. In addition, it has started to dismantle elements of the
restrictive and protectionist economic model which has guided the island's
economic life for much of the past 50 years, making Bermuda more attractive
to overseas financial services companies.
The island's two biggest banks - the Bank of Butterfield and
Vaughan-Johnson's Bank of Bermuda - which dominate some offshore financial
services, have been exposed to much greater competition in the trust and
securities business.
Legislation passed in 1991 allows newcomers to compete with the banks in the
trust business. As a result, the island's big legal and accountancy firms
have set up trust companies, while international institutions such as
Lombard Odier and Coutts have been attracted by the island's potential.
Schroders, the UK financial group, has taken advantage of the relaxation of
the rules to acquire full control of its local subsidiaries.
The easing of rules governing stockbroking operations has allowed the
creation of new local securities firms, such as First Bermuda Securities,
which are already spearheading some important innovations. First Bermuda,
for example, is playing a vital role in a prospective Dollars 131m project
to develop a new business hotel on the site of the Bermudiana hotel in
Hamilton, the capital - a development which it hopes will serve as a focus
for the international business community.
Partially responding to pressures from the likes of First Bermuda, the banks
have moved to streamline the local stockmarket, bringing it into line with
international trading centres. Daily trading was introduced for the first
time this February and plans to introduce electronic trading are advanced.
The market aims to become a centre for Bermuda's insurance and reinsurance
companies and for other companies now based in Hong Kong but which may seek
new homes after the Chinese takeover in 1997.
Greater dynamism in the banking sector is also expected. Mr
Vaughan-Johnson's appointment as the first non-Bermudian to head up Bank of
Bermuda is symbolic of the changing mentality among Bermuda's business
elites.
A shift in ownership earlier this year at Bermuda Commercial Bank (BCB), the
third largest bank but hitherto the poor relation of the banking community
is another indication of change in the industry.
The buyer, John Deuss, a Dutch oil trader and long-time Bermuda resident,
acquired a controlling stake from Barclays earlier this year and plans to
transform BCB into a niche bank, providing specialised services to corporate
and individual clients. But he also wants the BCB to be the first local bank
to offer long-term mortgage loans.
The decline in tourism, meanwhile, and the contraction in the economy which
has ensued, is leading to change even in more sheltered parts of the
island's economy. Local businesses dependent on tourism, such as retailers,
have become more adaptable and with full employment no longer guaranteed,
Bermuda's tough labour unions are becoming more flexible.
One small but telling example of this new realism is that shopkeepers on
Hamilton's Front Street have begun opening in the evenings. It is a step
which would not be out of the ordinary in Europe or the US, but for Bermuda
such a development would have been unthinkable five years ago.
Further change is on the cards. The growth of the reinsurance market this
year will place new demands on local infrastructure and services.
Bermuda is already a leading captive insurance centre and a favoured venue
for a number of specialist companies selling such esoteric products as
financial reinsurance and high level insurance covering international
companies against the cost of legal awards. Companies such as Centre Re, ACE
and XL dominate their markets and are among the fastest growing and most
profitable companies in the international insurance industry.
This year investors have chosen to pump more than Dollars 4bn into new
catastrophe reinsurance companies, with some of the world's leading
reinsurers establishing new subsidiaries on the island.
The growth has been fed entirely by developments on international
reinsurance markets, where rates have increased steeply following a string
of recent hurricanes and other disasters.
Bermuda's loose but reputable financial regulation and the absence of tax on
either profits, dividends or income, allow the companies much more room to
build up reserves against future losses, than in either the US or Europe.
'The insurance market is so large and substantial, it is bound to lead to
further opening up. People will become less insular,' says Audette Exel,
international manager at the BCB.
Further economic liberalisation is in the pipeline. Last March David Saul,
the finance minister, said he favoured ending exchange controls. 'To try and
shelter behind the 'business as usual' mentality will surely see the rest of
the world pass us by and our economy will slide backwards as a result,' Mr
Saul said recently.
Sir John Swan, the premier, says he has an 'open mind' on the issue of
exchange controls - at present Bermudians pay a tax on any capital
shipped out of the country. But he says that it may be difficult to
enforce rules restricting foreign investors to 40 per cent ownership of
non-exempted companies if exchange rules are scrapped. 'We would have
been like the rest of the Caribbean if we had had an open door policy.
We would have had a big private debt problem,' he says.
Sir John Swan concedes that Bermuda needs some restrictions and
protection, but he says the easing of exchange control is in everybody's
interest and can be done without adverse fall-out. 'We just have to
understand that exchange control is anachronistic . . . Something needs
to be addressed if we are going to call ourselves truly international.'
Local financiers such as Jeffrey Conyers, one of the founders of First
Bermuda Securities, agree. 'Business locally is more and more realistic. It
is part of a maturing process to become truly recognised as an international
financial centre.'

FT  19 OCT 93 / People: Non-executive directors - MAI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Richard Hooper, a consultant in media and telecommunications, will next
month join the board of MAI, the television, advertising and financial
services group 20 years after his first involvement with the company.
From 1973-77 Hooper was managing director of Mills &amp; Allen Communications,
part of Mills &amp; Allen, which eventually metamorphosed into MAI. It was
during his early stint at Mills &amp; Allen Communications that Hooper met the
present managing director of MAI, Lord Hollick, the Labour Peer.
Since then Hooper, a former BBC trainee and Open University producer, has
been director of Prestel, chief executive of value added systems and
services at British Telecom and founding managing director of Super Channel.
Hooper's experience of television should come in useful at MAI, which holds
the majority stake in Meridian Broadcasting, the ITV franchise-holder for
the south of England. Lord Hollick is also interested in the possibility of
bidding for the Channel 5 franchise if a national channel is advertised.
Hooper, 54, replaces Sir Graham Day who retires from the board having been a
non-executive director since 1988.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Survey of Aluminium (3): Involuntary price restraint -
Stocks and output capacity remain too high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALUMINIUM STOCKS are too high. If producers are to receive better prices
they must at least begin to fall.
There are two ways for that to be accomplished. Either consumption can
increase faster than production, or production can be reduced to a lower
level than consumption. All producers have been hoping for the former, and
too many have been relying on others to achieve the latter.
After rising uninterrupted for 10 years, though more slowly over the past
few years, consumption was barely changed between the first half of 1992 and
the same period this year. But Anthony Bird Associates, a UK consultancy,
described this in the July issue of its Aluminium Analysis as 'a healthy
performance'. Bird found it 'impressive enough that consumption should rise
by 3 per cent in the very sluggish economic conditions of 1992'. But the
maintenance of this high level in early-1993, 'when world industrial
production actually contracted slightly', was, it said, 'remarkable'.
Bird put this down to aluminium's 'excellent competitive position' against
alternative materials. It measured the metal's competitiveness at an index
of 99, only just below the level in 1985, the base year, and 40 per cent
better than in 'the dangerous year of 1988'.
Nevertheless, Bird saw the immediate outlook for consumption as weak and
expected to see some decline in the second half of this year from the
corresponding 1992 levels, 'bringing consumption for the year down to around
the 15.1m (tonnes) mark (from last year's 15.24m).'
Thereafter, however, it saw the omens as favourable: 'a strong competitive
position, economic recovery, and the prospect that the metal using
industries will do better than the average'. The upshot was that it expected
consumption to be growing at 3.5 to 4 per cent a year from 1994 onwards and
reaching 16.8m tonnes in 1996.
A similar picture was painted by Metal Bulletin Research in its September 1
aluminium market update. It saw western world consumption growth picking up
in 1994 to 3.8 per cent, with a slowdown to 1.5 per cent in the US being
offset by gains of 4.2 per cent in Japan, fuelled by strong gains in the car
and packaging sectors, 5.6 per cent in Asia and 4 per cent in western
Europe, restrained by a more subdued recovery.
According to a third recent assessment, by The Spector Report of the US,
western world aluminium shipments rose by 0.5 per cent in the first half of
this year. It projected a 1 per cent rise for the second half, giving an
advance for the year as a whole of about 0.8 per cent. But it estimated that
a 4 per cent rise would be needed next year to get stocks falling and
concluded that production cuts remained the only 'quick fix' to the
oversupply problem.
Most analysts agree that the gap to be bridged is now not that great.
Spector calculated that production cuts this year by Aluminum Company of
America (Alcoa) and Reynolds Metals, also of the US, amounting to an annual
356,000 tonnes, had left only 312,000 tonnes of surplus capacity.
Time is not on the industry's side, however. 'Like interest on the national
debt, each day's delay compounds the eventual solution,' warned Spector. 'In
the case of the aluminium industry procrastination, it just adds to the
amount of production that eventually has to be cut.'
In its July analysis Bird was less gloomy than some about the gravity of the
stocks problem. Excess stocks (over and above the 'normal' level of about
six weeks' consumption) amounted to about eight weeks' consumption, it
calculated. That compared with 13 weeks' consumption in 1982, at the low
point of aluminium's last big bear market. It put the current level of
oversupply - including continuing large-scale shipments from the former
Soviet block - higher than did Spector, at 500,000 tonnes a year.
'Nevertheless,' said Bird, 'aluminium producers must face these short term
difficulties before they can reach the - more promising - longer term.' Bird
found encouragement in the fact that exchange rate changes since 1992 had
pushed American aluminium producers' average costs ahead of those of their
counterparts in Europe, 'where it is notoriously difficult to adapt the
output of any factory to changing market conditions'. With the Americans now
in the costs hot seat it suggested that the aluminium industry could be
expected to become 'more responsive to excess stock levels than it has been
in recent years'.
It thus expected to see output cuts in the west, 'especially in 1994',
together with falling exports from the former Soviet Union, as its own
aluminium using industries and those of its traditional customers became
more buoyant. 'If consumption recovers at the same time in the way we
expect,' said Bird, 'there should be a deficit of over 750,000 tonnes in
1994 and more than 1m tonnes in 1995. Indeed as 1995 wears on producers will
have to recommission idled capacity.'
Metal Bulletin Research agreed that world stocks would fall next year,
though by a more modest 525,000 tonnes, from the 3.5m tonnes it projected
for the end of this year (against 3.61m tonnes indicated by the
International Primary Aluminium Institute as at the end of August).
With no new plant start-ups scheduled for more than two years - assuming
that the expansion of capacity from 173,000 tonnes to 646,000 tonnes a year
at Alusaf of South Africa is completed on time in late 1995 or early 1996 -
Bird saw the market becoming tight in early 1996.
'By then,' it said, 'the years of underinvestment in new smelter capacity
will be taking their toll. Producers will have to work their existing plants
very hard in order to keep up with demand; and they will be seeking to
accelerate any tentative smelter projects they may have. In spite of these
efforts we expect a period of aluminium shortage to return, accompanied by a
significant rise in prices.'
All that is in the future, however. For the present the aluminium market
languishes, and if producers are to get something more than 'jam tomorrow'
(or the day after tomorrow) some will have to follow the lead given by Alcoa
and Reynolds - and they need to look sharp about it.

<TEXT>
London Metal Exchange COPPER prices slumped to new six-year lows with late
weakness undermining all other metals with the exception of tin. Prices fell
through a succession of expected support levels, leaving the three months
position Dollars 47 down at Dollars 1,657.50 a tonne. Dealers explained that
last week's technical rally, which took the price above Dollars 1,700,
lacked fundamental justification. As stocks were expected to continue rising
with no production curbs on the horizon, prices would probably fall further,
they added. At the London Commodity exchange a rise in COFFEE futures was
attributed by dealers to option covering as the market became more
enthusiastic about Brazil's announcement that it was begining purchases this
week under the producers' export retention scheme. The January position
touched Dollars 1,224 a tonne before closing at Dollars 1,216, up Dollars 24
from Friday. COCOA prices firmed in early trade, the most active near March
position reaching Pounds 956 a tonne. But the rally petered out around
midday and the price closed unchanged at Pounds 944 a tonne.

<TEXT>
SKANDIA, the Swedish insurer, is selling its US life reinsurance unit,
American Skandia Life Re, to ITT Hartford Life Insurance, the big US
insurance group, for SKr170m (Dollars 21.6m).
The group said the disposal would enable it to concentrate on its
fast-growing annuity business in the US, carried out through American
Skandia Life Assurance Corp.
Premiums for this business amounted to SKr4.7bn in the first nine months of
1993, more than double the SKr2.2bn achieved during 1992.
American Skandia Life Re is based in Shelton, Connecticut and has annual
gross premiums of around SKr1.5bn. It specialises in risk analysis and
financial reinsurance for American life groups.
Skandia said it is committed to US non-life reinsurance within Skandia
America Corp, although premiums are being reduced as it concentrates on
casualty business.

sale

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Turkish government is to sell by local public offering its 30 per cent
stake in Usas, the national airline caterer which is majority owned by
Scandinavian Airline System.
The deal is expected to raise TL192bn (Dollars 16m.)
The government is selling 6m shares at TL32,000 a share, valuing the company
at Dollars 200m. The government is to retain a golden share and the rights
to 21 per cent of the net profits.
Turkey has so far raised around TL5,000bn in 1993, against an initial target
of TL15,000bn, which many analysts now believe is unrealistic.
The Usas offer, which will be fully underwritten, will be co-led by Turkiye
Is Bankasi, Turkey's largest commercial bank, and Global Securities, a local
broker.
The offering is being made for three days from October 20. Dealing is
expected to start on the Istanbul stock exchange by the end of the month.
However, brokers believe that the offering represents a significant discount
to the market.
The deal puts the company on a price-to-earnings ratio of 5.5 on projected
1993 earnings.
Usas reported pre-tax profits of TL205bn for 1992. The company reported real
sales growth in 1992 of 138 per cent, against an average inflation rate of
60 per cent.
SAS paid Dollars 14m for a 70 per cent stake in Usas in 1989, in what was
one of the first state sales handled by the Public Participation
Administration, the government privatisation agency.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Sri Lanka to speed up reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD COWPER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COLOMBO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SRI LANKA is expected to announce a reform package aimed at further
liberalising the economy and measures to tighten monetary policy to combat
rising inflation.
In the budget, due to be announced early next month, the government is set
to announce a speeding-up of privatisation, a further reduction in import
tariffs and a cut in the basic rate of income tax of up to 10 percentage
points from the current rate of 45 per cent.
According to a senior government finance official the top rate of import
tariffs will probably be cut from 50 per cent to around 40 per cent, with
most tariffs cut by 10 points across the board.
Mr D B Wijetunga, the newly-appointed president and also the country's
finance minister, has described inflation as the 'monster' terrorising the
country's economy and has given finance officials the task of cutting
inflation from about 12 per cent to single digits by next year.
The budget therefore is expected to be an austere one with an attempt to
reduce the deficit from about 8 per cent of gross domestic product this year
to 7 per cent next. A strengthening of tax collection and an increase in
indirect taxation, coupled with expenditure cuts and more precise targeting
of welfare spending, is expected. In addition a number of measures,
including the possible retirement of outstanding debt, is likely to be
announced to soak up surplus liquidity.
On privatisation, the government is considering a more radical approach to
the private management of the country's plantations, private roads, a
build-operate-transfer power project and the partial privatisation of the
telecommunications sector.
The budget, due to be announced on November 12, comes at a time when the Sri
Lankan economy is growing fast, but still faces structural problems.
A strong recovery in agriculture, notably tea and rubber, after a severe
drought hit output last year has joined with a 9 per cent real growth in
industrial production to put the country on course for an overall growth
rate of over 5 per cent in 1993.
The country's balance of payments, however, is experiencing mixed fortunes
with a sharp deterioration in the balance of trade. Exports grew 33 per cent
in the first half of 1993 to SLR61.8bn (Dollars 1.26bn), compared with the
same period last year but imports grew even faster at 35 per cent to
SLR95.9bn. The country's trade deficit soared 38 per cent to SLR34.2bn.
The decline in the trade balance helped to increase the current account
deficit from SLR12.8bn in the first six months of last year to SLR17.5bn in
the first half of 1993. However, a sharp net increase in capital inflows
arising from a more liberal investment environment and increases in foreign
aid saw a surplus on the overall balance of payments of SLR9.8bn, up from
SLR3.9bn in the first half of 1992.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE JURY in the trial of two black men accused in the beating of a white
truck driver unexpectedly said yesterday it had resumed deliberations,
agencies report from Los Angeles.
The jury said at the weekend it had reached verdicts on some charges
stemming from the attack on trucker Reginald Denny during last year's Los
Angeles riots but was deadlocked on others and further deliberations would
be pointless.
Superior Court Judge John Ouderkirk had said he would take partial verdicts
from the racially mixed jury at yesterday's hearing 'unless something
unusual happens or I receive some kind of communication from the jury'.
On the streets, police stepped up patrols as a precaution against violence
in the wake of the expected verdicts, though officials said they did not
expect trouble. 'We're heavily deployed,' said Lt John Dunkin. 'But I want
to stress that we are very optimistic we are not going to have any problems
today.'
The alert was modest compared with the one in place in April, as the federal
trial of four white policemen accused of violating black motorist Rodney
King's civil rights neared its end. There was no trouble when two of the
officers were convicted and the other two acquitted.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Serbs again warned of Nato strikes
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, has again warned the
Serbian president, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, of possible Nato air strikes to
halt any Serb effort to strangle the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, the State
Department said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington.
The department's spokesman, Mr Mike McCurry, said the Serbs had been warned
of the 'consequences of that strangulation'. Asked what those consequences
were, he referred to a Nato communique in August that warned of possible air
strikes against Serbian guns.
In Sarajevo yesterday, United Nations officials complained that organised
Moslem disturbances were disrupting their operations in central Bosnia and
negotiated for the return of two stolen armoured vehicles.
The Bosnian capital was hit by renewed shelling and fighting between the
three warring sides in the civil war was reported across the republic.
Peacekeepers in central Bosnia said women and children in Moslem-controlled
Zenica blocked a UN convoy and looted fuel from a peacekeeping patrol in
what UN sources called a systematic effort to disrupt their operations.
'We believe we are looking at organised civil disturbances,' said a UN
source in Vitez, about 12km from Zenica, where the incident took place.
'Clearly someone wishes to make a point. We're trying to find out what that
point is.'
The UN convoy aborted its mission and returned to a warehouse after about
150 women and children blocked its route out of Zenica. A similar crowd
surrounded and looted a UN Land Rover and trailer in the early afternoon,
stealing nine containers of fuel.
The UN said an 'uncontrolled' Bosnian army unit held up two armoured
personnel carriers carrying nine UN soldiers outside Sarajevo over the
weekend. They let the soldiers go after a few hours but kept the APCs and
other equipment.
General Francis Briquemont, commander of UN troops in Bosnia, met Bosnian
army commander General Rasim Delic yesterday to complain and demand the
return of the vehicles.
International mediators trying to come up with a peaceful solution to the
war were working on a new 'global approach', Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN
secretary-general, said. Mr Boutros Ghali told the French daily Le Monde he
met the UN mediator, Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, on October 9 to discuss all
options in case a peace plan for Bosnia failed and the situation
deteriorated in Croatia and Serbia.
'We worked on the idea of a global approach and a new international
conference following the London conference,' he said, referring to a meeting
in London last November which gave Mr Stoltenberg and Lord Owen their
negotiating mandate.
Diplomats said last week a global approach would be based on the premise
that the west might have a greater chance of extricating itself from the
Yugoslav quagmire if it tried to solve all the region's problems together
rather than tackling them piecemeal.
The UN leader said the plan to divide Bosnia into three ethnic mini-states
was not dead. 'No, nothing is buried,' he said. 'We must be very flexible,
very pragmatic. Suppose that tomorrow the parties in ex-Yugoslavia suddenly
come to agreement. One can never know.'
But there was no sign of any such agreement.
Moslems, who have declared autonomy in the north-west Bosnia's Bihac
enclave, yesterday claimed that government forces launched an attack on
Kudici, a village 25km south of the rebel stronghold of Velika Kladusa.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Survey of Bermuda (11): Cruises lead a recovery - Richard
Lapper finds tourism emerging from its recent decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS of a prospective Dollars 131m project to redevelop the Bermudiana hotel
has bolstered confidence in the island's tourism industry, which is slowly
beginning to recover following five years of worrying decline.
Last month, Bermuda Financial Centre (BFC), a group of mainly local
Bermudian investors, announced plans to buy the Bermudiana, a vast pink hulk
overlooking Hamilton harbour, moth-balled by its owners, Trust House Forte,
the UK hotel group, since 1988. BFC aims to demolish the hotel and covert it
into a new 330-room 'business hotel' and office complex, providing living
and working accommodation for businessmen visiting the island's
international financial centre.
One million dollars has been invested so far and BFC aims to raise Dollars
45m in equity capital. It will then borrow a further Dollars 85m to fund
Bermuda's biggest-ever construction project. First Bermuda Securities, a
local securities firm, is orchestrating the development together with
Canada's Gordon Capital. One of the firm's founders, Jeffrey Conyers, says
the new hotel will provide a 'focus' for the island's international
financial centre, confirming Bermuda's reputation as a place 'where serious
business is being done'.
The group plans to convert at least a third of the rooms into executive
suites and will also build a conference centre.
The buoyancy of Bermuda's offshore financial business, especially the surge
of investment in insurance, is propelling recovery among hoteliers in other
ways as well.
Professor Brian Archer, a Manchester-based academic who has surveyed the
economic impact of international business, says that the 7,000 business
travellers who came to Bermuda in 1991 were accompanied by 'approximately
7,000 friends and relatives'. Professor Archer says that the expenditure of
these visitors was 'considerable', amounting to a total of Dollars 8.4m
during 1991, or just over Dollars 1,000 per couple.
A number of hotels are earning an increasing proportion of their revenues
from business travellers. The Southampton Princess, one of the island's
biggest hotels, is particularly well known as a conference centre, for
example. Government officials estimate that more than one in 10 'tourist
arrivals' are, in fact, businessmen who choose not to declare the real
purpose of their visit on immigration forms.
Meanwhile, overall tourist numbers have begun to recover over the past 12
months, halting a steady decline which has plunged its biggest hotels into
the red.
After climbing to an all-time high of 631,314 in 1987, the number of annual
visitors fell steadily during the late 1980s to reach 547,480 in 1990,
514,329 in 1991 and 506,237 in 1992, the lowest levels for nearly 20 years.
Bermuda's eight biggest hotels between them reported a total loss of about
Dollars 17m in the 12 months to September 1992. Always an expensive place to
visit, Bermuda was hard hit by the downturn in the US economy - especially
severe in the north-east and mid-Atlantic states, from where nearly 60 per
cent of the island's visitors come.
The Gulf War made many would-be visitors jittery about international
flights, even though Bermuda lies only 568 miles east of North Carolina.
Bermuda has not benefited from the fierce price competition among US
airlines which has made many domestic destinations, especially Florida and
California, more attractive.
Gary Phillips, director of tourism, says that demand in the US has begun to
pick up this year.
The recovery is being led by the cruise ship sector, with numbers up by 14
per cent. Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines and Norwegian Cruise Lines have both
deployed new, larger ships this year to sail on their regular weekly cruises
from US east coast ports to Bermuda.
RCCL's 'Song of America' has increased berth numbers by 250 to 1,330, while
NCL's 'Dreamward' has 1,400 berths, nearly double the number available on
'Westward', the ship it replaces. Both these lines, as well as US-based
Celebrity Cruises, are reported to be experiencing buoyant levels of demand.
The hotels, meanwhile, have also seen visitor numbers increase over the past
few months. John Harvey, director of the Bermuda Hotels Association, says
occupancy levels have begun to recover. He expects the biggest eight hotels
to break even in when they report results for the 12 months to September
1993 in the next few weeks.
The main obstacle to overcome is the view that Bermuda 'gets very cold
during these months', says Mr Phillips. About half of Bermuda' hotels have
offered to reduce room rates by 20 per cent on each day that temperatures
fall below 68 degrees.
Visitors taking advantage of the scheme in the first three months of the
year obtained discounted rates for about 20 days.
Local shopkeepers joined in the scheme, by offering price reductions on the
cooler days, while some hoteliers offered other discounts, such as free
accommodation to children under 12.
Bermuda is also attempting to promote itself as a 'long haul' destination
for European visitors. Here, however, the island is handicapped by
inadequate air-connections, especially with potentially lucrative German and
Scandinavian markets.
Although British Airways reports a high level of occupancy for its regular
direct flights from Heathrow, the airline has no plans to increase frequency
from the current levels of three times a week between May and October and
twice a week for the rest of the year. As a result, travellers face a 12
hour journey via New York.
So far, neither the government nor local hotel operators have enjoyed any
success in their efforts to attract other airlines to fly direct routes. Nor
have they been prepared to entice charter operators to fly to the island by
sharing the cost of any losses.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Survey of Bermuda (12): More than a beach party - Living and
working
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and MICHAEL BLAKELY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIVING and working in Bermuda is rather the reverse of the mythical
ship-swallowing Bermuda triangle to which the island gives its name. Those
who enter it do not sink without trace; instead they continually bump into
one another.
People talk of 'island fever' - a psychological, claustrophobia-like
affliction of those who stay in the country for extended periods. It is,
after all, just 21 miles long and a maximum of one mile wide, with less than
60,000 inhabitants.
'You see the same people all the time,' says one resident. 'It can get very
tiring. It's like being part of a family, or on a boat in the middle of the
water. You've got to be part of the crew.'
'You can hardly go to the toilet without someone knowing it; and most know
how long you spent there too,' says Malcolm Williams, general
manager-secretary of the Bermuda Monetary Authority. 'But it is not a bad
place to be,' he adds, sweeping his hand to indicate the view of boats in
the harbour behind the exclusive Yacht Club.
For many expatriates, the situation may be relieved by business travel. For
others, trips to Boston, New York and North Carolina to shop are common.
Michael Blakely, managing director of World-Wide Shipping Managers, says:
'As long as you've got time away to look forward to, it's OK.'
In spite of the close proximity of its residents, Bermuda remains racially
segregated, with distinct areas dominated by blacks and others by whites.
People in certain social circles may bump into each other all the time; but
those in different groups rarely meet.
The island has a good number of local attractions, including an arts
festival each winter, several cinemas and a strong tradition of amateur
dramatics. 'You could do karate in Czech here if you wanted,' says one
resident. There is a zoo, aquarium and botanical gardens, as well as several
museums.
Much of this is sponsored by local business, perhaps often through a
combination of philanthropy and fear that without voluntary contributions,
the government may consider raising the necessary money through compulsory
means.
Ray Madeiros of accountants Cooper &amp; Lines says: 'We do not live in a
cultural vacuum here. We can buy daily newspapers from overseas. We never
feel totally isolated.'
Bermuda's beaches offer potential for sun-bathers and swimmers. Many
residents have boats and can sail to escape the crowded conditions onshore.
Inland are eight golf courses and numerous tennis courts.
The country's climate appears impressive on paper. But it becomes extremely
humid in late summer and intense, short bursts of rain are not uncommon
throughout the year.
Most of the island is densly populated. Some of the houses may be luxurious,
but even these generally have little garden space. And for expatriates
coming in, the costs of renting and buying have rocketed.
Coping with work permits can be problematic, with concerns for some as to
whether they will be renewed. Even worse, spouses are not entitled to a work
permit and are often unable to be employed.
Travelling around can also be frustrating, since the island allows each
family to use only a single car. Those coming from many parts of the world
find driving on the left or negotiating roundabouts difficult and they are
required to re-sit their driving test. A further frustration can be the
extremely low speed limit.
Bermudians claim to live in a tax-free existance. In fact, they pay a
'hospital levy' as a proportion of payroll expenses, as well as significant
property taxes. Employers may also be often paying private medical health
cover. These contributions may be relatively low, but the cost of living is
also substantially raised through government levies on imports.
Most expatriates seem content with the education system - both public and
private - that can take their children as far as university entrance level
for north America, although the schools no longer offer A-levels. Equally,
the Edward VII hospital is well regarded.
John Ellison of Conyers, Dill and Pearman, one of the country's largest law
firms, says: 'In this kind of business you have opportunities for travel,
talking to people all over the world: with the advantage that you don't have
to wear silly suits, get stuck in traffic for two hours and get mugged on
the way home.'
Most executives highlight what is referred to as 'the usual boring list' to
explain the ease of working in the country: an excellent infrastructure,
good communications, a variety of courier companies, professional services
such as lawyers, accountants and banks and a tightly-knit group of
individuals with easy access to one another when decisions need to be made.
But they are sensitive to suggestions that they take too great an advantage
of the posting. Michael Drew of Schroders says: 'You get a lot of pressure.
Because it's Bermuda, people get the idea that you sit on the beach all day
with your gin and tonic. It's not like that. I have taken two Saturdays off
in the past 10 years.'
Michael Blakely adds: 'I hardly go to the beach although I have been here
three years. Time seems to evaporate. To begin with you think you're on
holiday. And other people come here and think that you are. But there are a
lot more unpleasant places you could be.'

FT  19 OCT 93 / Survey of Bermuda (9): Catastrophe a new dimension / A look
at the recent swing towards specialisation in the insurance and reinsurance
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
INCREASING numbers of London brokers are preparing to make the long flight
to Hamilton, Bermuda, this autumn, as the injection of more than Dollars 4bn
into new catastrophe reinsurance companies adds a new dimension to Bermuda's
insurance and reinsurance industry.
Once known as the world's biggest centre for captive companies, the
character of Bermuda's market has changed radically since the mid-1980s,
with the launch of a series of well-capitalised - and so far profitable -
specialised insurance and reinsurance companies.
Bermuda already hosts some of the biggest players in a number of specialised
markets. ACE and XL dominate the market for high level liability covers that
protect manufacturing companies against large legal awards; the world's
biggest oil companies buy coverage from OIL and other Bermuda-based mutuals;
while Centre Re is a leading player in the financial reinsurance area.
Local industry leaders now believe that Bermuda will consolidate its
position as a leader in the catastrophe risk area. 'In the long haul, this
will result in Bermuda becoming a very significant multi-line reinsurance
centre,' says Walter Scott, president of ACE.
Critics point to the failures of a number of reinsurance companies in the
1970s and early 1980s, implying that the current boom may also be
shortlived. Bob Clements, president of Marsh &amp; McLennan Inc - the
international broker and insurance services company that sponsored the
formation of ACE and XL in the mid-1980s, Centre Re in 1988, and Mid Ocean,
the biggest of Bermuda's catastrophe reinsurers last October - derides the
view.
'It is popular for people who are threatened by Bermuda to say that these
enormously well capitalised companies might pack their bags in the night and
disappear,' says Mr Clements. 'But this has nothing to do with logic or
fact. It is absolutely absurd.'
Comparisons between the new wave of Bermudian reinsurers and those of the
1970s and 1980s are inappropriate, says Mr Clements, because the the growth
which preceded the earlier failures was driven almost exclusively by tax
considerations.
During the early 1980s the the US tax authorities began to restrict the tax
benefits available to captives. When these moves were reinforced by the
courts, many US captive companies tried to preserve the tax advantages by
underwriting third party business. But the weakly capitalised companies had
insufficient resources to underwrite adequately and were soon overwhelmed by
claims. 'They became a targetted as 'innocent' capacity,' says Mr Clements.
By comparison, the new wave of reinsurers based in Bermuda since the
mid-1980s are attracted by a range of other factors.
Many of the new companies hold important positions in niche markets. ACE and
XL were formed in the mid-1980s, when capacity in the traditional North
American market for liability insurances had virtually dried up.
Marsh &amp; McLennan, the international insurance broker, and JP Morgan, the
merchant bank, sponsored the companies, which received capital from leading
US corporations. Now, the two Bermudian companies meet many of the high
level liability insurance needs of the pharmaceutical industry, for example.
Together with OIL and TOPS, two companies formed by oil majors (again as a
result of capacity shortages in traditional markets), ACE and XL also
provide up to 50 per cent of the liability insurance needs of oil companies.
The founders of Centre Re, formed in 1988, spotted an opportunity for
providing so-called financial reinsurance products, covering against losses
that have already occurred but have not been paid or against losses that are
expected to occur in the future.
Through one of its subsidiaries, CentreLine, Centre Re covers a number of
syndicates at Lloyd's of London in a way that allows it to use its reserves
against long-tail claims more effectively.
In a similar way Marsh backed the launch of Mid Ocean in October last year,
as capacity for catastrophe reinsurance in the London market shrank after a
succession of severe weather losses between 1987 and 1993. Within a year
investors - including some of the world's largest reinsurance companies,
American International Group, Swiss Re and General Re - have followed suit,
forming nine new reinsurance companies.
Bermuda's attractions are likely to prove more durable. Its light and
reputable regulation, ideally suited to the needs of insurers and reinsurers
underwriting commercial business, is a key factor, especially from the point
of view of US companies.
The US system of state regulation - which proscribes policy terms and
tightly controls rating - is designed to protect buyers of home and motor
insurance. 'We are not talking about looking after the interests of Aunt
Millicent. We have professionals on both sides of the deal,' says Mr
Clements.
The absence of taxes on either incomes or profits in Bermuda gives Bermudian
reinsurers greater flexibility to build up reserves to cover future losses
than their competitors in either North America or Europe. Bermuda is a
convenient location geographically for internationally reinsurers who must -
almost inevitably - transact business with direct insurers in the United
States.
The new wave of Bermudian companies all operate in ways that are likely to
increase their advantages against their traditional competitors. They tend
to deal in high margin business, with relatively few clients frequently on
the basis of multi-year contracts. Their costs are low. ACE, for example,
has an expense ratio (expenses as a percentage of premiums) of about 16-17
per cent (compared to between 28 and 30 per cent for traditional US
insurers). XL, Centre Re and Mid Ocean all enjoy the same kind of cost
advantages.
Several factors could limit growth, not least the island's limited size and
labour force. Already Bermuda's housing stock is under some strain with
reinsurance chiefs prepared to pay up to Dollars 20,000 a month for
executive apartments.
Stephen Gluckstern, founder and chairman of Centre Re, predicts that
although Bermuda will remain an important centre for niche business, it will
be more difficult for it to grow as a fully-fledged 'full service'
reinsurance centre, a view which explains Centre Re's recent decision to
base its ZRC reinsurance subsidiary in New York.
ZRC, unlike Centre Re or Centre Cat, will write a full range of reinsurance
policies for American cedants, including quota share and proportional
business.
'For niche business people will come out of their way to see you. But it
must be harder to develop interests of a wider array of broker,' says Mr
Gluckstern. Mr Gluckstern points to a tax factor which could also come into
play. US insurers must pay excise tax of 4 per cent on all reinsurance
premiums 'exported' out of the United States, a cost which can offset
Bermuda's advantages on profits and income tax.
Even so no one should write off Bermuda's prospects for further growth.
Brian Hall, of Johnson &amp; Higgins, the international insurance brokers, has
been based in Bermuda for nearly 30 years.
'After each development I always felt we had reached a new plateau. I can't
expect the growth to continue. But it does.'

FT  19 OCT 93 / Survey of Bermuda (10): Pace quickens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'IT IS happening faster than we thought it would,' says Michael Butt, chief
executive of Mid Ocean Re, the first of a new generation of catastrophe
reinsurance companies formed in Bermuda during the past 12 months.
Mid Ocean underwrote gross premium income of Dollars 247m in its first nine
months of business, recording profits of Dollars 44.4m. On a few contracts
it is acting as a lead rather than simply offering a following market. And
in the run-up to the January renewal season when many of the biggest
reinsurance contracts are renegotiated, the company is building up its
underwriting team.
Jeremy Hindle joined from Swiss Re as deputy to Henry Keeling, a former
Lloyd's underwriter, in October. Investors have clearly been impressed with
progress to date, with the company's capital base doubling to Dollars 738m,
following a successful initial public offer in the summer.
And so are Mid Ocean's competitors, judging by the speed at which the
world's leading reinsurers are following Mid Ocean's example.
At least nine companies have been formed since the middle of this year,
increasing the capital base of the catastrophe reinsurance market to more
than Dollars 4bn.
Among the big names investing in the island are General Re, the United
States' biggest reinsurer, SCOR, France's leading reinsurer, and Swiss Re,
the second biggest reinsurance company in the world, which has joined forces
with Manhattan investor, John Head.
The American International Group, the world's best capitalised company,
which first established subsidiaries in Bermuda in 1953, has set up a new
catastrophe reinsurer, IPC Reinsurance, capitalised at Dollars 300m.
Indeed, among established players only Munich Re, the biggest reinsurer in
the world, and Lloyd's of London are absent, although many of the new
Bermudian companies intend to underwrite shares of catastrophe business
originally led in London.
Overall net assets held by Bermudian insurance and reinsurance companies now
amount to more than Dollars 24bn.
Jeffrey Conyers, of First Bermuda Securities, a local securities house
describes the developments as 'absolutely astonishing'. David Saul, finance
minister, says the companies represent a 'seal of approval' for Bermuda's
business sector.
Critics suggest that capital has been formed at such a rapid pace that it
could lead top a resumption of the rate competition, undermining the 'hard
market' - high rates and tight conditions - that made catastrophe
reinsurance so attractive to investors in the first place.
Mr Butt - and most of the rest of his colleagues in the local market -
disagree. For a start underlying rates are much higher.
According to Charles Skey, an underwriter who works with Mid Ocean in its
London office, 'the rating basis has changed totally' in recent years with
rates for all major catastrophe risks at higher levels than at any time
during the past 30 years.
Capital is being deployed more cautiously. Mid Ocean is underwriting on a
much higher solvency margin - with premium income equal to only about a
third of the company's capital base.
Mr Butt suggests that by introducing tougher conditions on their
proportional policies, European reinsurers are pressing many of their
customers into the catastrophe reinsurance market, fuelling demand and
sustaining prices.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Survey of Bermuda (8): Ping-pong balls a thing of the past -
Patrick Harverson follows the rapid developments that have swept the stock
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM ping-pong balls and local stocks to high technology trading,
international company listings and multi-million dollar equity issues in
five years? Improbable as it sounds, many members of Bermuda's business
community believe the local stock exchange can travel this rapid growth
path.
For the moment, the Bermuda stock exchange (BSE) remains a tiny market for
mostly local company stocks. Only 28 companies are listed on the exchange,
with a total market capitalisation of about Dollars 1bn. On average, roughly
Dollars 750,000 worth of business is done during the daily hour-long trading
session.
But these modest figures belie the extent of the changes that have swept the
BSE this past year. It began in November 1992, when the Bermuda Stock
Exchange Act incorporated the exchange and gave the Bermuda Monetary
Authority (BMA) responsibility for supervision.
That was followed in February of this year by the replacement of the old
'ping-pong ball' system whereby the island's three banks used to draw lots
using numbered ping-pong balls to determine the order of the weekly trading
session - with daily trading and stock prices listed on Reuter screens.
Then, earlier this summer, the three banks which run the exchange - the Bank
of Bermuda, the Bank of Butterfield and Bermuda Commercial Bank - began
writing new membership rules. The final draft of the new rules, which will
allow other firms to participate in the market, have been handed to the BMA,
and are scheduled to be approved within a few weeks.
The last steps in the process will be to complete the writing of new rules
covering company listings and to finish a review of trading practices.
William Dolan, manager of the Bank of Bermuda's private banking department
and current chairman of the BSE, says these two steps should be completed by
next year.
Although the banks will argue that modernisation of the BSE has been their
aim for several years, competition posed by a new over-the-counter (OTC)
market that quickly drew business away from the cumbersome BSE proved an
important motivating factor.
The new OTC market was the brainchild of Joe Taussig and Jeffrey Conyers,
who run the brokerage firm First Bermuda Securities. They set up the OTC
market, with the approval of the authorities, in May last year.
'We took that view that Bermudians would trade more if you gave them the
opportunity,' says Mr Conyers. Previously, all orders had to go through the
three banks. The OTC market allowed investors to buy and sell stocks through
First Bermuda.
Volume took off once the OTC other investment management firms on the island
started using it, says Mr Taussig. 'In the month of April, before Jeff
started this, the average volume was less than one million dollars of shares
a month. We've had million-dollar days now.' He claims the off-exchange
business now accounts for more than 50 per cent of the entire Bermuda equity
market.
The OTC market, however, suffers in comparison to the BSE in a crucial
respect - stamp duty is no longer levied on transactions executed on the
BSE, while there is no such exemption for off-exchange trading, much to the
frustration of First Bermuda.
As Mr Taussig explains: 'When it turned out that stocks traded off the
exchange were subject to stamp duty, which is a huge disadvantage for us, we
of course said: 'Let's join the exchange.' We've asked to join, but they
won't less us join. They're still studying it.'
First Bermuda, and other firms such as Lines Overseas Management which trade
on the OTC market, argue that the banks are fearful of the competition that
non-bank membership would represent.
The banks deny the charge, although the BSE chairman admits that stamp duty
remains a 'contentious' issue. He says: 'We at the exchange felt that we
should not exclude the other parties, because they'd view that as the big
boys cutting them out. But the government has taken the position that this
is the Bermuda Stock Exchange Act, and any transactions that gain the
benefit of exemption from stamp duties must be conducted on the exchange.
'So that's forced First Bermuda Securities, etcetera, to come through banks
to place their trades, which they are understandably upset about.'
The issue, however, should be resolved soon when the new membership rules
are approved by the BMA, and the likes of First Bermuda and Lines Overseas
Management join the BSE.
Yet an expanded membership would only be the first step toward making the
BSE a market of more than only local interest - listing rules and new
trading practices still have to be drawn up.
Malcolm Williams, general manager of the BMA, says that the BMA and the
banks are working hard to put the framework in place that would attract
international companies to the BSE. Only four non-Bermuda companies are
currently listed.
He says: 'Look at the Jardine Mathiesons, the Exels, the Centre Res. We have
lot of household names on this island. We have provided them with a very
suitable place to operate, and I believe if we provide them with a very
suitable stock exchange, then, as they are using Bermuda, they will also use
the Bermuda stock exchange.'
It would be a natural step for some of the island's big international
insurance companies to list on the BSE, says Mr Dolan. 'If you look at the
Oslo stock market, that's the biggest capital market for the shipping
industry. We should focus in on the insurance industry here and actually do
the listings and underwritings from Bermuda. ACE, Exel, Mid Ocean Re, Mutual
Risk have had IPOs, and they've all been done from New York. I think there's
considerable capacity to do those issues from here in Bermuda.'
Then there are the hundreds of mutual funds operating out of Bermuda - many
of them could list on the exchange. Even more exciting to Bermudians is the
possibility that Hong Kong companies, particularly those already
incorporated on the island, might use the BSE as some form of safe haven to
insure against any problems when China gains political control of the colony
in 1997.
Audette Exel, head of Bermuda Commercial Bank's international business,
says: 'The top 50 per cent of the Hong Kong stock exchange are actually
Bermuda companies. Having spent four years in Hong Kong, it's my belief that
if they had the opportunity to list here, they would. So in terms of mutual
funds and Hong Kong, you have a market that's just waiting to list.'
Other visionaries see the BSE playing a role as a base for transactions in
an even wider range of international securities - debt as well as equity.
'Geographical location is the key to Bermuda,' says finance minister Mr
Saul. 'This is where all the interest is coming from the Far East. You can
work throughout the day there, and then have work done for you at night
during the day here. That's where the exchange could be useful.'
But this is all heady stuff, and the BSE has to learn to walk before trying
to run. The lack of a modern clearing system is one obvious weakness.
Without one, international securities firms would not execute trades on the
BSE.
It is a chicken-and-egg situation, admits Mr Taussig. 'You only place the
orders when you think you can get it done. But if you don't get it done,
nobody will place the orders.'

FT  19 OCT 93 / Survey of Bermuda (7): Business goes beyond mutual funds -
Investment management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH more than 300 mutual funds are domiciled in Bermuda, there is more
to the island's investment management business than just mutual funds.
A small but growing number of specialised financial firms are running
investment portfolios from Bermuda, not only for individual and
institutional clients, but also for themselves.
A wide range of firms on the island now offer investment management services
to a wide range of clients. Prominent local companies such as Lines Overseas
Management and PRP Performa Limited manage money for the island's insurance
community and First Bermuda Securities, Bermuda Asset Management and Kast
Investment Management, offer investment management services to local as well
as international customers.
Then there are the bigger names with operations in Bermuda. These include
Fidelity, the US fund company, Kidder Peabody, the US securities firm,
Monroe Trout, the Chicago-based commodities trading house and Schroders, the
UK trust group. Finally, a host of individual investment specialists and
one-man firms also manage portfolios from the island.
Although no one has yet tried to calculate the size of this burgeoning
industry, the evidence suggests that it is expanding fast. Investment
managers are coming to Bermuda for several reasons, including the island's
accommodating regulatory environment, its first class telecommunications
links and its convenient geographical location.
More important, they are taking advantage of a trend that is noticeable in
other financial centres - the movement of investment management business and
expertise away from the traditional locations, as computer and
communications technology allows specialists actively to manage portfolios
from almost anywhere in the world where there is an electric wall socket and
a telephone plug.
Although the focus of most investment management on Bermuda is directed
overseas to the prosperous business of running offshore portfolios for
international clients, some firms are aggressively pursuing business right
on their own doorstep, namely the island's fast-expanding insurance
industry, with its Dollars 52bn worth of assets.
Until recently, Bermuda firms have not been seeking business from the
insurers, primarily because they assumed that the big international
insurance companies preferred to have their portfolios run from centres such
as New York and London, either by their own managers or by huge securities
firms.
Although this assumption still holds in general, a few local firms are
beginning to win business from the insurers.
They include Lines Overseas Management (which hopes to have Dollars 120m
under its control, some of it from small island-based insurers, by the end
of the year), and PRP Performa, whose head, Hugh Barit, has been managing
money for captive insurance companies for more than a decade.
Another firm hoping to catch the insurers' attention is Orbis, a former Hong
Kong money manager which now commands Dollars 490m in three Bermuda-based
equity funds. Alan Gilbertson, a director of the firm, says: 'A lot of the
insurance companies here are very young, and are building up to a point
where they can become more adventurous with their investments. Some of them
are beginning to dip their toes into the water of equity investment.'
Orbis runs three of the many mutual funds registered in Bermuda. Growth in
these funds - the bulk of them sold to international trusts, or high-net
worth offshore investors in Europe and the East Asia - has been impressive.
Two years ago there were 200 funds domiciled on the island. Today there are
more than 300.
The growth of Bermuda's mutual fund business, however, continues to be
hampered by its virtual exclusion from the huge US market, because of
regulatory restrictions.
Ken Morgan of the Bank of Butterfield says the banks and other fund managers
are unlikely to pursue opportunities in the United States until the
authorities there loosen the regulations. 'At some point we might look at
it, if we are able to find a way through the regulatory system up there. If
there was a straightforward and simple way we'd do it,' Mr Morgan says.
As for the UK market - a seemingly natural target for Bermuda fund managers
 -only a few local firms have obtained the recognition from UK regulators as
a special 'designated territory' that is required to market their funds in
the UK.
Malcolm Williams, general manager of the Bermuda Monetary Authority, says he
is surprised that no more than a handful of Bermuda firms have sought
UK-designated status. And he is not sure why so little interest has been
shown so far. 'I suspect it's because most of our collective investment
schemes are closed-ended, and in the UK they're open-ended and aimed at the
UK public,' he says.
The biggest presence in the island's mutual fund business remains Fidelity
International, whose president (and Bermuda finance minister) David Saul
describes as a 'cousin company' to the huge US fund group.
Fidelity International now manages Dollars 10bn, but none of the management
is done on Bermuda, where the 32 staff act purely as an administrative team
for the company's many non-US operations.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Survey of Aluminium (6): Money-go-round - Recycling has come
to stay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE first time last year more aluminium was produced in the UK from
recycled metal than the country's smelters produced from bauxite, the raw
material for aluminium - 251.800 tonnes from recycled material and 244,200
tonnes of primary aluminium.
So the industry was begining to feel the full benefit of the Pounds 28m
spent by Alcan of Canada on a dedicated aluminium can recycling facility at
Warrington, in the north of England. The plant started operating two years
ago with the ability to process 50,000 tonnes of used beverage cans a year.
Yet only about 70,000 tonnes of aluminium beverage cans are sold in the UK
and most of them are thrown away. So used beverage cans (UBCs in the
industry jargon) are being imported, mainly from the US, to feed the
Warrington plant.
This is not commercial madness but an example of the aluminium industry's
commitment to recycling and its determination to put the infrastructure in
place to make recycling work.
Even though Alcan won a low-cost Pounds 24m loan from the European
Investment Bank towards the Warrington project, the investment makes sense
only because of the peculiarities of aluminium production. For, while
manufacturing new aluminium takes a great deal of energy - typically 15
MegaWatt hours of electricity a tonne - the metal 'stores' that energy. It
can take as little as 5 per cent of the original energy to make used can
sheet as good as new.
The relatively high value of aluminium - aluminium cans are worth six to 20
times more than any other used packaging material and are the most valueable
used package found in household waste - enables the industry to promote can
recycling as a way for collecters to have a decent income.
These efforts resulted in aluminium can recycling rates in Europe and the US
reaching record levels last year. In Europe the rate rose from 21 per cent
in 1991 to 25 per cent while the US rate jumped from 62.5 per cent to 67.9
per cent.
Big money was involved. The US Aluminum Association estimates that the
industry paid out Dollars 968m for used cans, money that went back into
local economies to benefit individuals, schools, churches, scout troops and
so on.
However, the industry also benefits - and not only from giving itself a
green image. Cans provide cheaper metal because they can be recycled on a
closed loop system (from cans to scrap and back to cans again), because they
save as much as 95 per cent of the energy needed to produce new aluminium
and because the capital cost of a recycling plant is only one-tenth of a
smelter.
According to Aluminium Can Recycling Europe (Acre), at least 39,595 tonnes
of aluminium cans were recycled in Europe last year, up from 32,350 tonnes.
The European industry has set itself a target of recycling 50 per cent of
all aluminium cans by the mid-1990s at a time when aluminium's share of the
beverage can market is also growing rapidly - it reached 51 per cent in
1992. Sweden, with its mandatory deposit scheme, had the highest recycling
rate last year, 86 per cent, followed by Iceland, 75 per cent, and
Switzerland, 68 per cent.
Mr Alexander Wirtz of Acre, says that 'cash for aluminium cans' machines in
Switzerland today are even found high up in the Alps next to ski huts.
The recycling rate in Austria jumped from 25 per cent to 40 per cent last
year and there were steady increases in Ireland (11 to 16 per cent), Italy
(15 to 18 per cent), Greece (26 to 29 per cent) and the UK (11 to 16 per
cent.) Efforts to promote further growth and to provide the necessary
collection infrastructure are being co-ordinated by Acre, which was formed
in 1984 by Alcan of Canada, Pechiney of France and VAW of Germany. Alcoa and
Reynolds of the US, joined in 1988, and Alusuisse-Lonza (Switzerland), Hydro
Aluminium (Norway) and Elval (Greece) agreed to provide support in their
domestic markets.
But can recycling has a great deal further to go before it catches up with
some other sectors. Already as much as 70 per cent of the aluminium used in
electrical engineering, building and transport is re-used. Aluminium
automotive castings are almost entirely made from scrap metal.
The industry is now belatedly turning its attention to recyling aluminium
foil, a tricky business because a great deal of bulk has to be collected to
get any reasonable weight and 90 per cent of foil is meant to be in contact
with food which creates hygeine problems in handling and storage.
In the US, Reynolds Metals, the second-largest aluminium group, began
testing foil recycling in 1991. Mr Jeremiah Sheehan, Reynolds' executive
vice president, consumer and packaging products, admits that it is not as
commercially necessary for the industry to recycle foil as beverage cans -
in the US only 200m lbs of aluminium is used annually for consumer foil,
plus a similar quantity for food and other containers, compared with 4bn lbs
used for cans.
'But recycling helps to identify foil as a green product,' he points out. It
gives foil an edge over plastics.
In the UK nearly 40 per cent of aluminium used in packaging (including
beverage cans) goes into foil and about 50,000 tonnes of aluminium foil
packaging, worth roughly Pounds 15m, is thrown away every year.
To recapture at least some of this, an Aluminium Foil Recycling Campaign
(AFRC) was started by foil converters Alcan Ekco Packaging, Bowater Foil and
Paper Products and William Garfield, all members of the Aluminium Foil
Container Manufacturers Association, with British Alcan Consumer Products.
AFRC spent Pounds 200,000 over two years on five pilot schemes from which it
became obvious that foil would not be collected successfully by local
authorities working alone, without help from the industry. So the industry
has drawn up a 10-year plan which will establish national infrastructure and
work towards a 30 per cent recycling target.
Typically, schemes will provide local authority 'foil bank' systems serviced
by a single local charity or group of charities. Banks will be located on
supermarket or other prime sites. AFRC says the involvement of a local
charity provides motivation for the public to give for their own community -
clean foil can fetch Pounds 350 a tonne. Schools will also be involved in
the collection schemes. The scheme is funded by a voluntary levy of Pounds
10 a tonne from the rolling mills.
Meanwhile, the European Community seems likely to set a 60 per cent target
for the recovery and handling of all used packaging materials - and the
responsibility for achieving this level falls largely on the producer
industries.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Survey of Aluminium (7): Ford breakthrough - The age of the
aluminium motor car draws closer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR ALUMINIUM producers the most exciting recent news was the revelation by
Ford, the world's second-largest automotive group, that it is testing a
fleet of 20 Mercury Sables, a popular mid-sized US car, made largely of
aluminium, writes Kenneth Gooding.
This was the first clear indication that aluminium is suitable for the
production of high-volume, rather than just low-volume 'niche,' cars. Sables
and the Ford-badged equivalent, the Taurus - the best-selling car in the US
 -are produced at an annual rate of more than 500,000. Ford, it seems, has
overcome most of the problems associated with producing aluminium cars from
an an infrastructure which was set up to produce them from steel.
Ford worked with Alcan of Canada on this project. The automotive group
wanted to be able to build aluminium cars on its existing equipment,
including big steel presses, which represented a huge investment.
Mr Gian Frontini, Alcan's vice president, technology and engineering, says
the project involved two particularly big challenges: how aluminium could be
formed on steel presses and how to join aluminium. These have now been
solved. Alcan proved it was possible for aluminium to be shaped on existing
steel presses - even using the same tooling in some cases. Ford made a
break-through with special light welding robots.
Mr Frontini says he has not been given any inside information by Ford about
its future production plans but his educated guess is that the group will
gradually add more aluminium body parts to certain models and in five or six
years time a car with an all-aluminium structure will be launched.
Mr Kenneth Kohrs, Ford's vice president of car product development, says the
aluminium Sable was part of a Dollars 25m effort to see whether it was
feasible to produce a volume car from aluminium. The experimental cars weigh
about 400 lbs less than identical models made of steel. Another 20 aluminium
Sables are being built for company and fleet testing.
Ford also plans a big expansion in its use of aluminium over the next five
years to penetrate the sheet, or 'skin,' usages that have traditionally
belonged to steel. This includes aluminium fenders, hoods, decklids and trim
on the next generation of the Taurus car, expected to be launched in the
autumn of 1995.
Mr Kohrs points out his group already is the biggest user of aluminium in
the US motor industry. Significantly, Ford's experimental vehicle, Synthesis
2010, which is a rolling test bed for a variety of new automotive technology
 -including a three-cylinder, two-stroke engine made of aluminium - has a
body made of aluminium. Synthesis achieves weight savings of about 1,000 lbs
compared with the present steel Sable while having about the same interior
dimensions.
Weight saving is the big incentive for the US and Japanese car industries to
turn to light-weight aluminium. The US government is imposing
ever-tightening fuel economy standards and aluminium enables the car makers
to meet those standards by reducing weight without any loss of performance.
The main incentive for European car makers is a conviction that car
recycling will become a big issue in future. European companies are also
enthusiastic about the high-performance characteristics aluminium offers.
For example, Mr Franz-Josef Kortum, chairman of Audi, the upmarket
subsidiary of Volkswagen, Europe's biggest car group, says that Audi's new,
top-of-the range model, soon to be launched, will offer drivers 'a new
experience because of its light weight, stiffness and rigidity and safety.'
Audi worked with the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) on the new car and
they took a different route to Ford and Alcan. As aluminium is initially
much more expensive than steel, they believed it would be too expensive
simply to substitute aluminium components for those traditionally made of
steel.
Instead, they designed a car that has many fewer individual components and
structures than are used in a steel vehicle. They developed a spaceframe, a
skeleton-like body structure, composed of fewer than 100 extrusions and
castings compared with as many as 300 for a stamped steel body. New
manufacturing processes had to be developed to produce these spaceframes and
new aluminium alloys claimed to be safer than steel.
For car makers, the new technology offers several advantages: it cuts the
weight of a car's body by about 35 per cent compared with traditional steel
bodies without reducing the vehicle's size it reduces tooling expense by as
much as 50 per cent, and cuts the number of parts to be stocked and the time
taken from design to production.
Audi has spent about DM1bn (Pounds 400m) to bring its new luxury car to the
market. Mr Kortum says: 'We have changed the rule that says the bigger and
better the car, the heavier it must be.' However, it is not yet possible to
promise that all Audi's cars will one day be using this technology. At
present the process is economic only for production runs of up to 100,000
cars a year but the partners are looking for ways to make longer runs
viable.
Meanwhile, Alcoa has spent Dollars 70m for a plant at Soest in Germany where
it is producing space frame components which it aims to sell to other
manufacturers. Hydro Aluminium, part of Norsk Hydro, Norway's biggest
industrial group and Europe's biggest producer of aluminium extrusions, has
a vested interest in the success of the space frame concept, which could be
a big user of extrusions in future. Hydro has also been co-operating on car
space-frame concepts since the mid-1980s with various groups, including
Renault in France, Porsche in Germany and Pininfarina in Italy.
This year Hydro started supplying aluminium sub-frames from a Michigan
factory for General Motors' new Corvette sports car. The sub-frame was
previously produced from stamped aluminium sheet. Mr Ted DiGuiseppe, vice
president, sales and marketing, Hydro Aluminium Automotive Structures, says
his company's sub-frame weighs only 11 kgs, or 2 kgs less than the stamped
aluminium equivalent and also saves 75 per cent on tooling costs - an
important consideration with a low-volume model to be produced at the rate
of only 20,000 to 30,000 a year. In total the extruded sub-frame costs 18
per cent less than the stamped one.
Mr DiGuiseppe remains to be convinced that the Ford-Alcan concept of
replacing steel car 'skins' with aluminium will not be too expensive. He
admits, however, that the companies offering aluminium space frames are
having the difficult task of persuading car companies not only to use a new
material but also new manufacturing processes.
Alcan's Mr Frontini says: 'The choice of technology is up to the auto
companies. And Ford has firmly decided that the stamped unibody is the
answer.'
The debate will continue, but whatever the outcome, one way or another the
automotive industry will use a great deal more aluminium after the year
2,000. As Mr Bill Stuef, manager of Ford's advanced vehicle systems said
recently: 'In a decade, the material of choice clearly will be aluminium.'

FT  19 OCT 93 / Survey of Bermuda (5): Reason to feel cheerful - Patrick
Harverson finds international business has sustained earnings growth for the
banking sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN BERMUDA, you do not have to look far for evidence that the island's banks
are optimistic about their future.
In Hamilton, the capital, the Bank of Butterfield is building 30,000 square
feet of office space adjacent to its Front Street headquarters. A few
streets away, the Bank of Bermuda is constructing a 75,000 square-foot
office complex on Bermudiana Road, and round the corner on Church Street
Bermuda Commercial Bank's home is receiving an expensive internal
remodelling and facelift.
The banks have good reason to feel confident. Although Bermuda's economy has
been in recession for the past three years, the banks have not suffered
unduly because their profitability has never been tied to the domestic
business cycle.
Instead they have been able to draw on their burgeoning international
business to sustain earnings growth.
Global forces are also working in their favour - as international political
and economic barriers come down, and corporate and individual tax rates in
the industrialised world go up, demand for the kind of offshore financial
services Bermuda's banks offer is growing substantially.
The two largest and oldest banks have posted steadily improving earnings in
recent years. For the recent fiscal year, which ended on June 30, the Bank
of Bermuda reported a 26 per cent increase in profits to Dollars 35.8m,
although the results would have been even better but for an Dollars 8.7m
provision the bank took to cover possible losses on its domestic loan book.
Meanwhile the Bank of Butterfield reported a 12 per cent increase in net
income, to Dollars 30.1m.
Although the the island's third bank, the relative newcomer Bermuda
Commercial Bank (BCB), has struggled in recent years, its future looks
brighter now that the UK banking group Barclays has sold its controlling
stake to John Deuss, a Dutch oil trader and long-time Bermuda resident who
plans to transform BCB into a niche bank that provides specialised services.
Bermuda is unique among offshore financial domiciles in having a home-grown
banking industry. Foreign banks are not allowed to operate on the island,
and in their absence Bermuda's banks have mostly thrived. Yet domestic
business represents only a fraction of their earnings.
Instead, the banks earn their money from their international businesses  -
institutional and individual trust and fund administration, global custody,
foreign exchange and treasury, offshore advisory work for corporations and
wealthy individuals, private banking for offshore clients - which are run
either from Bermuda, or from overseas locations such as London, Hong Kong
and the Cayman Islands.
While banks have seen most of their international businesses prosper, one
important area - the offshore trust business - is giving them cause for
concern, not because of weakening demand, but because of growing competition
within Bermuda from foreign trust companies.
Since the government - keen to promote the development of the island's
financial services industry - pledged to end the banks' monopoly in the
offshore trust business, the Bermuda Monetary Authority has granted trust
licences to four foreign companies: Coutts and Schroders of the UK; Lombard
Odier of Switzerland and Royal Trust of Canada.
The move brought fierce opposition from the banks, which lobbied vigorously
against opening up the trust business - going so far as to place full-page
advertisements in the local paper outlining their case against deregulation.
Yet the BMA was determined to push ahead. 'We saw it as a means of
diversifying the country's income,' says Malcolm Williams, general manager
of the BMA.
Donald Lines, chief executive of the Bank of Bermuda, says they were worried
that the newcomers would take existing business away from the banks: 'Our
big concern was that they would divide, rather than add. Naturally, we were
concerned. After all, it is our business. It's taken 50 years to build it.'
The banks' concerns, however, fell on deaf ears. 'We asked the banks whether
they would like 100 per cent of this table, or 15 per cent of this room,'
says David Saul, Bermuda's combative minister of finance.
The banks do, if somewhat sheepishly, admit that they have benefited from
deregulation. 'The ones that are here are doing business with us, and we'll
do business with them,' says Stephen Kempe, head of international and
corporate banking at the Bank of Butterfield.
The banks, however, have another concern about deregulation - that newcomers
to the trust business could harm Bermuda's reputation by attracting the
wrong kind of business to the island.
'The last thing we want to read in the newspaper is that some gambling
organisation out of Las Vegas has formed a trust company in Bermuda,' says
William Thomson, the Bank of Bermuda's executive vice president. 'That would
not do us any good, because the kind of people we deal with don't like to
associate with that kind of environment.'
The BMA insists that it will continue to scrutinise carefully every trust
company that applies to set up shop on the island. 'We don't exactly ask
what size of socks the top executives are wearing, but we do ask for
absolute details of the type of business that is coming in,' says Mr
Williams.
The opening up of the trust business still has some way to go, although Mr
Williams says growth will be well managed. 'We have opened the door, but not
allowed everybody to come through. Bermuda, being so small, has to be
conscious of the effect that any development will have on the
infrastructure. We haven't had them piling in. So far so good. Whether we
will have to put a lid on, remains to be seen.'
The second major development in the banking sector this year was the sale of
the Bermuda Commercial Bank.
BCB plays a special role on the island because when it was founded in 1969
it was Bermuda's only black-owned bank, and an important symbol of the
island's racial mix. Ownership of the bank, however, has changed hands
several times since then, while BCB struggled to find its way. Until this
year, the controlling stake was owned by Barclays, which also supplied
management under contract.
The Barclays years, however, were not a great success - the perception on
the island was that the UK bank was never really committed to BCB. So when
Barclays decided in 1990 to put its stake up for sale, hopes rose that BCB
might be revived under new ownership.
It took until May this year, however, before a buyer was found. During that
time the bank languished. 'It was difficult to market a bank that was for
sale,' says Audette Exel, the general manager of BCB's international
operations.
Although the bank, with a poor-performing domestic retail business and an
unsure international image, was not an easy sell, a field of potential
purchasers, including several big North American banks, eventually emerged
for the BMA and the government to consider. 'There were seven serious
overtures for the bank,' says finance minister Mr Saul.
The final choice of First Curacao International Bank, a tiny operation based
in the Dutch Antilles, with only six employees, surprised Bermudians at
first. The government, however, was confident that First Curacao and its
owner, Mr Deuss, represented the best choice. Mr Saul explains: 'When we
looked at it, and at what was best for Bermuda, in the end the right
decision was made. John Deuss will make this into an endemic Bermuda Bank.'
His point is echoed by Ms Exel, who worked closely on the acquisition with
Mr Deuss. 'He is a brilliant purchaser. First, because he's got enormous
resources. Second, because his experience in offshore finance is
unparalleled. And third, because he's so committed to Bermuda - he's been
here for 20 years.'
When Mr Deuss outlined his ambitious plans for BCB, the decision quickly
earned approval from the local community which began buying the bank's stock
in anticipation of a turnround in BCB's fortunes.
The 32 per cent controlling stake was sold to Mr Deuss for Dollars 6.91 a
share in a deal valued at Dollars 3m, and the stock reached a high this
summer of Dollars 14.50.
The new owner's plans are relatively simple. BCB, which has already
withdrawn from the unprofitable domestic retail banking business, will work
on building a franchise as a niche international bank. It will offer
specialised offshore financial services to institutional and individual
clients, focusing initially upon fund and trust administration, and on the
needs of foreign Bermuda-based companies.
It will not be easy, given the substantial head start enjoyed by Bank of
Bermuda and Bank of Butterfield in promoting their expertise in offshore
finance, but the new-look BCB believes there is enough room on the island
for three globally-minded banks.
'We're smaller and leaner and more internationally focused than the other
two, and we're going to be presenting a much more niche image,' says Ms
Exel. 'We're happy to compete with them. There's plenty of business to go
round.'

FT  19 OCT 93 / Survey of Bermuda (6): A focus for liberalisation - Offshore
trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFFSHORE trusts play an important role in the Bermudian economy, as a
long-standing and significant part of the international business attracted
to the country, and most recently as a focal point for the gradual
liberalisation of its protectionist policies.
While this year's telephone directory has no entry for Coutts &amp; Co, the
banking group, in the centre of Hamilton, the company's building is
prominent. John Ritchie, its managing director, began work in early January,
days after changes in the law became effective and Coutts was granted
permission to establish a presence on the island.
Figures compiled by the Bermuda Monetary Authority, the country's financial
regulator, show that last year there were 24 applications for trust company
licences. By the end of 1992, 22 companies had been licensed, including 15
existing local companies, six newly-incorporated local companies and one
newly incorporated exempted company.
The intense secrecy of trusts - with no public disclosure of any meaningful
value - means no reliable figures are available on the number administered
from Bermuda. But it runs into several thousand, with most held by the
banks.
The recent expansion in trust administrations would not have been possible
until very recently. Following an announcement by the finance minister that
liberalisation was to permit the entry into the market of new trust
companies, and about two years of discussions, a new trust law was passed in
1991.
Until that time, the market was controlled by a few entities - most notably
the three local banks, the Bank of Bermuda, the Bank of Butterfield and the
Bermuda Commercial Bank. During the previous two decades, the authorities
have all but frozen new applications from trust companies.
The government decided to pass the law in spite of some resistance, while
granting the banks the concession that their new rivals would not gain
deposit-taking powers. In some quarters, the concerns linger on. Cumming
Zuill of the Bank of Bermuda, says: 'I think it will affect us. The sector
will be harder to control, leave more room for error, pressure on
infrastructure, and we will lose staff.'
But Coutts' Mr Ritchie denies that the entry of new trust companies will
squeeze existing business. 'We're going to be out there promoting Bermuda.
With that marketing, the cake will get larger,' he says.
Aside from the new entrants, competition is growing between the existing
entities involved in administration. All the different service providers
argue for the strengths of their own type of expertise in trust work.
Richard Pearman of Conyers, Dill and Pearman, one of the biggest law firms
on the island, says: 'We are individuals, not monolithic corporate trustees.
We emphasise a continuing personal relationship.' Diana Kempe of Appleby,
Spurling and Kempe, the other large Bermudian law firm, says: 'Our services
are cheaper. We have no acceptance and termination fees, and less
sophisticated structures.'
Mr Zuill says: 'We have more formality and structure. The larger banks are
too big, and not responsive because it is not their principal business. This
is a very personal business. You have to be sensitive to the needs of the
client.'
The nature of the products is also changing. Traditionally, most trust
business has been personal, involving either the passive holding of
individuals' assets - such as race horses, oil paintings and property - or
active management of their money.
Malcolm Williams, general manager-secretary of the Bermuda Monetary
Authority, says interest has been growing recently in offshore trusts
throughout the world, driven by concerns such as an increasingly 'fortress'
Europe, the changes in the former eastern bloc countries, and the Gulf War.
uncertainty over the future of Hong Kong in the hands of China after 1997
has persuaded many residents to place their personal assets offshore in
jurisdictions such as Bermuda, and many are redomiciling their companies on
the island.
'Business tends to reflect international misfortunes,' says Mr Williams.
'When there are changes in government or turmoil, it makes people think
about protecting their assets.'
But Bermuda benefits from other unusual types of trusts. The special purpose
trust allows for a beneficiary beyond those conventionally allowed - namely
person or a charity. Purpose trusts can make a company the beneficiary,
creating what Donald Malcolm of Conyers calls 'a true orphan'. These
entities classify for relief as foreign sales corporations under US tax
rules.
One of the more common uses is for aircraft leasing. By placing the aircraft
into such a trust, it can escape the clutches of a liquidator if the leasee
collapses, providing reassurance to bankers. This was used recently by GPA,
the Irish leasing company which narrowly escaped formal insolvency
proceedings.
Mr Zuill says pension trusts are also being established in Bermuda, designed
by companies for international executives moving between countries, each
with different pension requirements.
Meanwhile, there is pressure for the development of asset protection trusts,
by which individuals - often professionals likely to face negligence
lawsuits - place their assets outside the control of creditors, sometimes in
the knowledge that they have been or are about to be sued.
'I'm not entirely happy with those,' says Mr Ritchie. 'They rely on knowing
a great deal. We as a group are very careful. They are not a vehicle we are
encouraging.'

FT  19 OCT 93 / Survey of Aluminium (5): Rivals show their mettle - New
materials
</HEADLINE>

ALUMINIUM is the most modern of the leading industrial metals and its
fortunes since it first came on the scene just over a century ago have
always been linked with technical progress in the manufacturing industries.
But if technology has provided the aluminium makers with a seemingly endless
stream of opportunities it has also, especially in recent years, thrown up a
series of strong competitors. It is in meeting these challenges and in
developing ways of extending its uses throughout the manufacturing sector
that the future prosperity of the industry is seen to lie.
The latest challenge, which is threatening aluminium's share of the
lucrative aerospace market, has come from so-called 'composites', such as
carbon-epoxy, in which carbon fibres are embedded in toughened resins. These
provide a blend of strength and lightness exceeding those of the usual run
of aluminium alloys, and nowhere is this quality more prized than in the
aerospace industry.
As is usual with advances in aerospace materials the new composites have
been taken up with the greatest enthusiasm in the defence sector. They also
threaten to eat into aluminium's traditional dominance in the commercial
aircraft sector - but not as deeply as had been expected.
A case in point is the 777 airliner being developed by Boeing. A year ago
the company estimated that composites would account for about 10 per cent of
the structural weight of the aircraft, chiefly through their use in the
vertical and horizontal tails, the floor beams of the passenger cabin and
the trailing edge flaps. That would have helped to cut aluminium's
contribution to the weight of the airframe to 55-60 per cent, compared with
73-75 per cent in the Boeing 757 and 767. More recent estimates suggest that
aluminium will still contribute 67 per cent.
The aluminium producers are not taking even this more modest incursion into
their territory lightly, however. New alloys, involving titanium and lithium
(the lightest of all metals) among others, are being developed to achieve
improved compression strength and corrosion resistance. And the industry has
come up with its own 'composites' in the form of structural laminates, such
as Alcoa's 'Arall', which combines aluminium with fibre-reinforced epoxy
layers to cut weight and improve fatigue life and damage tolerance. Already
Arall is being used in the cargo door of the McDonnel Douglas C-17 military
transport.
Another composite, Duralcan MMC, an aluminium-based metal-ceramic material
developed by Alcan of Canada, is expected to have important uses in
aerospace, motor and energy. Alcan claims it is lighter and stronger than
steel or titanium and can be made more corrosion-resistant.
In the electrical industry aluminium tends to be a challenger rather than a
mere reactor to challenges.
Alcan of Canada, through its Alupower subsidiary, claims to be the leader in
the field of aluminium-based electric power sources. These systems, which
offer much reduced volume and weight compared with conventional batteries,
are making significant inroads into the markets for standby batteries for
the telecommunications industry, propulsion power for underwater vehicles
and range extenders for road vehicles - all areas where weight saving is at
a premium.
The extended use of electricity for public transport is also providing
opportunities for aluminium. Guide rails for rapid transport systems is one
example, and higher up the technological ladder comes the construction of
guideways for high-speed rail lines such as the Maglev (magnetic levitation)
system used already at Orlando and Las Vegas in the US. Such systems are
also obvious outlets for light aluminium rail cars.
The motor industry has traditionally used a lot of aluminium, but there is
always room for progress. Amax has high hopes for its 'semi-solid forging'
(SSF) technology in this area. This uses specially processed aluminium
billets for forging at one stroke into high quality car components needing
little, if any, further finishing.
SSF also has possibilities in the aerospace sector, says Amax, and in the
manufacture of domestic appliances.
For most people the kitchen is the place they are likely to come into
contact with the greatest variety of aluminium uses - in cooking foil, food
packaging, appliances such as refrigerators, cookers and food processors
and, of course in the casing of the now ubiquitous microwave oven. The
inside of the microwave is still widely regarded as a no-go area for
aluminium, however, and that is something the producers of aluminium foil
and containers are anxious to change.
Early microwaves had glass-covered magnetrons, which could be damaged by
energy waves reflected from metal, so the manufacturers warned against its
use in them. Microwave technology has improved since then and the new
protected ceramic magnetrons can cope with aluminium providing a few simple
rules are followed - it is claimed, moreover, that in tests arcing is
extremely rare even if the container is placed hard against the oven's wall.
Mr Nick Kendal, managing director of Alcan Ekco Packaging, says a growing
number of manufacturers have been persuaded by test results that their
initial strictures against the use of aluminium in their microwaves are out
of date and have included instructions for the use of foil containers in
later editions of their manuals.
At its Montreal headquarters Alcan has developed 'Micromatch', an aluminium
microwave tray allowing selective heating for the various components of a
pre-prepared meal - even no heating at all for individual components, if
required. That sort of advantage could help to overcome prejudice in the
convenience food sector and once microwave meals are appearing in aluminium
packaging on supermarket shelves the consumers' resistance will surely begin
to evaporate.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Survey of Aluminium (4): Contract fights on / A look at
alloy trading on the LME
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE London Metal Exchange, through long experience, does not expect its new
contracts to be welcomed with open arms. The aluminium alloy contract,
launched just over a year ago, has proved no exception.
Argument raged around the industry for more than two years before the
contract finally got off the ground. Its success is important to the
exchange, which is constantly on the look-out for ways to expand its
business and has run out of pure base metals. Leaving aside the high grade
aluminium contract (which replaced the initial aluminium contract) and the
relaunched tin contract, the alloy contract is the exchange's first new
product for 13 years.
The LME has again found itself defending its product. As Mr Ralph
Kestenbaum, LME vice-chairman, told Metal Bulletin's eighth international
aluminium conference in Montreal last month, the two other contracts
introduced on to the LME in the past 25 years - primary aluminium and nickel
 -were met with extreme hostility. In fact the leading producers tried to
boycott the contracts, which today provide the daily prices that govern the
industries.
'If you look at the turnovers of primary aluminium and nickel today as
compared with five, 10 and 20 years ago and if you look at metal stored in
LME warehouses you can see that the growth is overwhelming,' said Mr
Kestenbaum.
Mr David King, chief executive of the LME, believes that the contract is
gaining acceptance and has considerable potential.
Three-month metal has been trading for about 10 months and turnover is
significantly higher than we experienced when nickel and primary aluminium
were introduced, he said.
Two years ago the chances of making the contract work were put at only 50-50
by some LME members. The Organisation of European Aluminium Smelters and the
Japan Aluminium Alloy Refiners Association were against it.
But by launch time, the omens appeared good. Secondary aluminium smelters
were losing money because of the poor state of the economy and they were
pleased to let the LME have metal for ready cash. This was reflected in the
rapid build-up of stocks in LME warehouses, which reached 15,000 tonnes at
the beginning of the year and were approaching 40,000 tonnes by April. They
now stand around 46,000 tonnes.
Secondary aluminium production is about 4.5m tonnes a year mainly of
automotive grade alloy. The motor industry uses more than 70 per cent of
production. By the time of the contract launch 47 alloy brands had been
registered by producers, between them accounting for about 2m tonnes a year
output.
The contract specifies three grades for delivery - German DIN 226, Japanese
AD12.1, and US A380-1. These represent the basic or (in the words of one
trader) 'bog standard' die-casting specifications in Japan, Europe and the
US, the three main consuming regions. Although the three chosen grades vary
slightly they are designed for the same function - automotive die-casting -
and consequently in practice there is little difference in their prices. The
contract is in dollars, covers lots of 20 tonnes and can be traded 15 months
forward.
Whatever the omens at the launch, the first year of trading has seen low
volumes and featureless trading. This is not surprising given that the
launch was made at the height of the recession.
There has also been no specific event to make the secondary price vary from
the primary price. And the primary market has had a tough year as demand
remained flat and production rose to the extent that primary stocks in LME
warehouses burst through 2m tonnes in August.
'Some might take the view that it was launched at the wrong time,' says Mr
Angus MacMillan of Billiton-Enthoven Metals. 'They are wrong. It's better to
launch when prices or the economy are depressed than when the primary price
is volatile - that would only have exacerbated any reluctance to use it . A
slow work-in is probably better.'
Even so, there are those in the industry who believe that the LME has listed
too many alloys, making it more difficult to get a clear price. Mr Peter
Nix, of the secondary ingot producers association, believes a single alloy
would lead to wider participation by the industry. 'The 380 would be best to
start with - that is the most universally used.'
However, Mr MacMIllan, says the LME would have been restricting itself
unnecessarily in using only one specification. He also believes the LME
would be foolish to start tampering with the contract now.
Mr King of the LME agrees: 'We are more than satisfied with the current
situation, but we will be putting more resources into educating the
secondary aluminium market about the contract and the LME.'

FT  19 OCT 93 / Survey of Bermuda (4): Skills well employed / Profile of
David Saul
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HAVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAVID SAUL, Bermuda's minister of finance, is a man of some contradictions.
He is a successful local member of parliament who loves the cut and thrust
of political debate, but who also hates to be labelled a typical politician.
He clearly loves his work, yet also says that the only reason he does it is
because he has no choice. He is an action man who loves scuba-diving,
spear-fishing and kayaking - but who also likes growing roses and collecting
stamps.
If Mr Saul is anything, he is certainly not dull. Nor short of an opinion.
His fondness for voicing his thoughts, frankly and with little consideration
for the subtleties of Bermudian politics and business, have made him
something of a maverick. Yet he is in other ways the consummate island
insider; after all, he was once a business partner with former Bermuda prime
minister Sir Edmund Gibbons.
A first generation Bermudian, the 54-year old Mr Saul is the son of a
British soldier who came to Bermuda with the Argyll Regiment and stayed on
after he bought himself out of the military.
The colonial influences in Mr Saul's life are strong - he attended
university in England and Canada, graduating with a PhD in educational
theory and a doctorate in educational psychology. The latter, he says, has
been valuable as a financier 'because finance, the movement of the markets .
. . is a game that must be studied from a psychological aspect'.
If it is true, Mr Saul appears to have used his skills well, steering the
Bermudian economy through the toughest recession in living memory with its
finances and infrastructure intact.
Mr Saul claims that he got into politics by accident. Having been a civil
servant under various governments, he worked for Sir Edmund Gibbons for two
years in the early 1980s. In 1984 he joined Fidelity, the US mutual fund
group, but when he turned down their offer in 1989 to move to London with
the company, Mr Saul found himself pressed into service as a member of
parliament. After winning his local seat of Devonshire South, he was
unexpectedly chosen as finance minister.
His four years at the finance ministry have been marked by a pragmatic
stewardship of the government's purse and by his steady, if not always
popular support for a controlled deregulation of Bermuda's financial
services industry.
He was one of the prime movers behind breaking the banks's monopoly of the
island's trust business, something which did not endear him to the banks. He
is also keen to see the banks open up membership of the local stock exchange
to other firms.
Bermuda's bankers are not the only ones to have had their feathers ruffled
by Mr Saul - other politicians and the local press often find him blunt and
over confident to the point of arrogance. 'His tone of delivery gets some
people's backs up,' says one businessman.
It is a view of himself with which he does not necessarily disagree. 'I
don't like politics with a capital P. I'm probably far too brash. I don't
shake hands or kiss babies, and I don't suffer fools gladly.'
He is looking forward to another term at the finance ministry but he does
not intend to stay on for ever. 'I will not die in the job,' he says. When
he does retire from politics he should have plenty to do. Just reading his
list of hobbies - marathon running, scuba diving, kayaking and canoeing,
hiking - leaves you short of breath.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Survey of Bermuda (2): Island's fortunes looking up -
Richard Lapper finds investment plans are back on the agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARELY a year after Bermuda began to emerge from its worst recession since
the 1930s, the island's economic prospects are looking a good deal brighter.
An upturn in the fortunes of the tourism industry, unexpectedly rapid growth
of the island's offshore insurance and investment business and the
re-election in early October of the United Bermuda Party (UBP) have
bolstered business confidence and stimulated plans for fresh investment.
Mild growth of at least 1 per cent is expected for 1993/94, following a
slump in gross domestic product of more than 6 per cent between 1989 and
1992, when domestic demand fell back to 1987 levels and capital formation
retreated to a point not seen since the end of the 1970s. Growth was hit by
a decline in tourism, mainly due to recession in the north and east of the
US, which supplies more than 60 per cent of Bermuda's visitors.
The island's problems were compounded by a sharp contraction of money supply
by the local monetary authority, following a rapid expansion in credit
between 1986 and 1988.
On the employment front, more than 2,500 jobs were lost between 1989 and
1992. Foreign workers - from the Azores and the Caribbean - have borne much
of the impact. More than 5,000 work permits have been cancelled since 1989
and the number of foreign workers reduced to less than 5,000.
Even so - by Bermudian standards - unemployment has been high, reaching an
estimated 5 per cent by the end of 1991.
But just as the decline was largely a result of Bermuda's dependence on the
US economy, so the sudden nature of the recent upturn is largely a result of
external factors. Growth has been helped by the steady increase in tourist
numbers in recent months.
But confidence - and future prospects - have been boosted primarily by a
rapid increase in the number of offshore investment and insurance companies,
and an unprecedented growth in the reinsurance sector.
Spurred by developments in the international reinsurance markets, where
rates have risen sharply following a succession of large losses, nine large
reinsurers have established subsidiaries or new ventures on the island
within the past 12 months.
The new investment should help spur recovery in the construction sector,
which has suffered in the downturn. Four construction projects worth up to
Dollars 60m are all primed to go ahead in the next few weeks, according to
finance minister David Saul.
This reflects moves by local developers to build new office accommodation
for the increasing numbers of reinsurance companies choosing to locate on
the island.
Business interest could also help local hoteliers claw their way back to
profit, by providing extra demand for conference and other facilities. The
linkages between tourism and finance have been underlined by the Bermudiana
business hotel redevelopment of the Bermudiana hotel complex which, if it
goes ahead, will be the biggest in the island's history.
In the meantime, Mr Saul, who has presided over the island's finances during
the recession, now has a different category of economic problem to manage.
Mr Saul says that his biggest fear is that the economy could overheat. 'We
have to watch the boom in construction,' he says, hinting at a possible
surge in imports if developments are not controlled.

ballot box / A look at politics in the territory

<TEXT>
FORGET about trying to contact the top executives of Bermuda's leading
companies on election day. Most will be out at the polling booths, not just
marking their ballots but endlessly shaking voters' hands in their role as
candidates.
The connection between politics and business was reinforced earlier this
month when the United Bermuda Party (UBP) re-established the grip it has
held on power since the country became self-governing in 1968. The UBP is
ideologically right of centre and unashamedly pro-business. Many of its
members of parliament and even ministers are senior business people or
partners within the professions.
Potential conflicts of interest abound in Bermuda. If an individual is not
wearing two hats, then the chances are that she or he has a sibling or
cousin in high places who is. Even the opposition Progressive Labour Party
(PLP) is beginning to attract professionals such as accountants and lawyers
as candidates, increasing the inter-connections between business and
politics.
That does not mean that string-pulling always works. In spite of lobbying
efforts by the country's three home-grown banks which have long supported a
strong degree of economic protectionism, a new trust law was introduced in
1991 which has opened up trust work to other local and international
companies. Local interests in some areas are beginning to give way to more
global ones.
The unanswered question is how far Bermuda could survive a change of
government. Talk to most civil servants on the island, and they will insist
that they are independent and willing to serve whichever party comes to
power. But this system has not yet been tested, and a speech made shortly
before the election by one senior PLP official hinted that certain public
servants in senior positions might expect to be changed because they had
become too closely allied with the UBP.
A change in Bermuda's political position could also pose a challenge for the
island's future as an offshore financial centre for international business.
While many executives publicly remain detached or neutral on political
matters, privately many express concerns that the PLP's ascendancy would
generate a rush to the airport.
The rhetoric in the October election from the UBP made frequent reference to
'the islands to the south', pandering to fears of a repeat of the experience
in countries such as the Bahamas, which lost much of its international
status after the economic reforms introduced by the Pindling administration
in the early 1970s. Ironically, much of it ended up in Bermuda. The UBP
reinforced its message with constant references as to whether the PLP was
'fit to govern'.
These claims of incompetence have been vigorously rejected by the PLP, which
says it recognises the contribution of offshore businesses to the economy
and would do nothing to harm them. It has, however, said it will place
greater emphasis on its planned programme of 'Bermudianisation' which would
return the country to its own citizens.
Issues of race are frequently discussed. While many white Bermudians and
expatriates will insist that racism and discrimination do not exist, few
blacks would agree. Few hold senior positions and many parts of the island
have concentrations of one ethnic group or another, 30 years after
desegregation was formally introduced.
Concerns about race may explain why the PLP boosted its share of the popular
vote from 37 per cent to 46 per cent, while other minority parties or
individuals outside the two-party system were voted out of office.
The PLP, which has remained in permanent opposition, still draws its support
predominantly from the black community and blue-collar voters although it
has now begun to garner professionals as voters too.
Drugs and education were among the more significant election issues raised
by the party. In a country of just 60,000 people, parochial concerns were
also important, such as pledges that St George's, at the eastern end of the
island, would be the exclusive harbour for a cruise-ship. Many political
activists say that Bermudians expect to be personally canvassed by their
politicians
One of the most widely discussed issues in this year's election was the
future of the US naval air force base in the east, which brings substantial
revenue to the country and runs the civilian air traffic control and airport
maintenance that is essential to Bermuda's infrastructure. Warnings of a US
withdrawal have generated frenetic travelling to Washington DC to negotiate
better terms.
Bermuda's political structures have a number of peculiar features. The
40-person assembly which meets once a week has some of the smallest
constituencies in the world. Most hold less than 2,000 voters and each has
two seats - an apparent legacy of the time when landowners had extra votes
which were converted after desegregation into a seat for blacks within each
district.
Then there is the link with Britain. Removing Bermuda from the sterling area
during the 1970s - when the country pegged its currency to the US dollar -
is one of only the most obvious indications that the island looks at least
as much to the west as east across the Atlantic towards its old coloniser.
Yet the post of governor remains - appointed by the British and paid for by
Bermuda. Lord Waddington, the former British home secretary and leader of
the house of Lords, who took over the job in summer last year, may have
attempted to be more informal than his predecessors, but he retains control
of foreign affairs, internal security, defence and powers of pardon.
He is reluctant to be drawn on the subject of eventual independence, but
says: 'Those who support the status quo would say Bermuda has it both ways:
it is self-governing and has stability ultimately underwritten by Britain.
'It has found it convenient to remain a dependent territory.'

FT  19 OCT 93 / Survey of Aluminium (2): Partners in grime - With western
aid, the CIS keeps on smelting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KARL Wobbe admits he seriously underestimated the ability of the Russian
aluminium industry to keep production going against all the odds.
'At the begining of 1992 I thought their industry would collapse because of
raw materials shortages,' he recalls. Instead, the Russian smelters managed
to produce about 2.7m tonnes of aluminium last year, not too far away from
the 1991 level.
Traders came to the rescue with barter deals, offering necessary raw
materials in exchange for aluminium which poured into western markets at an
annual rate of about 1m tonnes.
For example, Mr Alan Bekhor, managing director of Trans-World Metals, says
his company, which claims to be the biggest trader of CIS aluminium, helped
'kick-start' production at two smelters by providing cash to improve the
flow of alumina, an essential raw material. Trans-World also invested in
port facilities in the far east of Siberia.
The ability of the canny western traders to keep things moving when faced
with a variety of obstacles - language barriers, political uncertainties,
civil strife and the lack of legal protection and insurance commonly
available in the west - is impressive.
There is also the problem of theft. 'Whole rail cars are uncoupled at night
and simply disappear. A train with five cars might arrive at its destination
with only two,' one trader reports. 'And with something like the
Trans-Siberian Railway, you have enormous, unpopulated distances involved.
It is very easy to offload something, pay off the engineers and sell it
privately.'
Shortages of spare parts, which weighed heavily on some other CIS
industries, caused few problems. Ten of the 14 CIS smelters use outdated
Soderberg technology and make their own spares when necessary. Ironically,
the modern smelters were hit by spare parts shortages and Tadjikistan's
smelter had to reduce output by 40 per cent last year.
The influence of international traders on the CIS industry is not entirely
to the liking of Mr Wobbe, management board director responsible for
aluminium production at VAW of Germany.
He says: 'Traders are not the right partners for the Russian aluminium
industry. It should be the western aluminium producers. Producers have the
know-how to help develop the internal CIS market - for packaging, for
transport, for construction. It will take a long time, but the best partners
for the Russians would be the western aluminium industry.'
He points out that, until demand for aluminium in the CIS domestic market is
revitalised, the smelters will go on producing for export and those exports
will continue to depress international prices.
Last year the CIS smelters delivered only 1.8m tonnes of aluminium to
domestic customers, a sharp drop from the 2.6m in 1991. While chaotic
conditions in the CIS and the virtual disappearance of military customers
cut demand, the market could have taken more metal. The fish canning
industries in Russia and the Ukraine complain that there is not enough
available. Among other things, the metal is also used for canning caviar,
one of the few Russian products that has instant appeal overseas.
Aluminium has that same appeal. Russia and some other parts of the CIS can
produce top-quality aluminium - much of it used to go into military and
aerospace equipment - which is readily convertible into dollars.
Smelter managers prefer to export to earn dollars instead of being paid by
domestic customers in rapidly depreciating roubles. Their smelters are not
just making metal - they provide the sole support for whole communities,
including schools and hospitals. Dollars earned provide food, medicine and
school books, not just smelter equipment.
But the smelters are also tremendous polluters. If Russia actually enforced
its environmental regulations, all its smelters would have to close. Yet the
cost of moving to state-of-the-art smelting technology is prohibitive. VAW
estimates that it would cost Dollars 6bn to install modern technology in
just four of the 14 CIS smelters. The money for that kind of project is
simply not available.
However, another - much less costly - solution is emerging. Western
companies have started to help the CIS industry to upgrade its old Soderberg
smelters. For example, Kaiser Aluminum of the US is offering intermediate
technology that costs only about Dollars 600 per tonne of installed
capacity.
Kaiser is working on a Dollars 50m project at the Krasnoyarsk smelter,
covering 90,000 tonnes of capacity, and Mr Sam Manaktala, director of
technical services of Kaiser's primary products division, says this aims to
reduce fluoride emissions from 6.7kg a tonne of metal produced to 1.2 kg and
to cut carbon emissions from 6 kg a tonne to under 1 kg.
The government granted Kranoyarsk an export licence so that it could export
free of tariffs enough aluminium to cover the cost.
This project is scheduled to be completed in September next year. Kaiser
also recently signed a protocol to carry out similar upgrading on one of the
four production lines at the Irkutsk smelter in Siberia.
Only three years ago there were ambitious plans to build a 130,000 tonnes a
year smelter on a greenfield site near the Irkutsk plant which would also be
modernised. But this would have cost Dollars 700m and Mr Manaktala says this
project has been shelved until metal prices have risen to a level to make it
viable and until economic conditions in Russian would make it possible to
raise capital.
Kaiser Engineers, the UK company which, confusingly, is no longer related to
the US group but is part of ICF Kaiser, has been working on studies for the
rehabilitation of smelters in Azerbaijan which use modern, pre-bake
technology.
Reynolds Metals, another US company, also has well-tried technology for
improving the performance of Soderberg smelters. This technology is being
offered by the Kumera Corporation, a Finnish group, which has five separate
projects under way. Mr Vesa Kumpulainen, Kumera's chief executive, says the
Reynolds' technology not only cuts pollution substantially - at one smelter
20 kg of emissions a tonne would be reduced to only 2 kg - it also saves
energy.
Reynolds itself is working with Fata, an Italian industrial group, and a
Russian consortium on a downstream project to produce aluminium foil.
VAW, meanwhile, has forged what Mr Wobbe describes as 'an excellent
relationship' with the Novokuznetsk smelter in Siberia, 'which we will
modernise in steps'. VAW is also attempting to set up joint ventures in the
CIS to produce dedicated downstream products for dedicated markets. These
products will have export potential because, as Mr Wobbe points out, the CIS
industry still needs to export in order to earn hard currency for raw
materials.
'We have to accept the Russian aluminium industry as an equal partner in the
world industry, but this means it has to accept the rules of the free
market,' he says.
That will not be easy because there are political tensions between Concern
Aluminiy, the holding company for the CIS industry, and some smelter
managers. But there have been recent signs that the CIS industry is willing
to discuss with representatives of the European Community, the US and Canada
some kind of international rationalisation of production capacity.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Survey of Aluminium (1): Russia is in the market - Amid
continuing recession, the industry is trying to adjust to the deluge of
metal exported by former Soviet producers notorious for low wages and high
pollution levels. Prices have plummeted, thousands of employees have been
laid off, and new capacity has been cancelled or mothballed

THE WORLD aluminium industry is adjusting painfully to what Mr A Stephens
Hutchcraft, president of Kaiser Aluminum of the US, describes as 'the new
reality'.
He says: 'The new reality is that Russia and other countries of the
Commonwealth of Independent States are now part of the world supply/demand
structure and will be an integral part of our industry. If we ignore that
fact, we do so at our peril.'
The industry is floundering because, in the words of Mr Paul O'Neill,
chairman of the Aluminum Company of America, the world's biggest producer,
governments have failed to find 'a mechanism to deal with the economic
consequences of the dissolution of the former Soviet Union'.
Turmoil created by the collapse of the rusting iron curtain has helped to
drive down aluminium prices to their lowest level in real terms so that
virtually every smelter in the west is not even covering its cash costs of
production. Smelters are being shut, thousands of employees laid off and
virtually all plans for new smelters have been either abandoned or shelved.
The stresses are most severe in Europe where production costs are highest.
'About 85 per cent of the world's smelters are losing money - that's
terrible. And I fear the lights are going out in European smelters,' says Mr
Karl Wobbe, management board member responsible for production at VAW of
Germany.
Yet at the end of the 1980s the aluminium industry in the west seemed to be
striding confidently down a road to increasing prosperity.
Demand for aluminium has been moving ahead by an average 3 per cent a year,
with growth in all the main markets: construction, packaging, transportation
(trains, aircraft and automobiles) and electricals.
The greatest potential for immediate growth is in packaging - aluminium is
easy to sterilise for food and medical applications, it is an excellent
barrier against liquids, vapours and light, it is non-toxic and imparts no
taste or odour. In the US nearly every fizzy drink and beer can is made of
aluminium.
Longer term there is potentially enormous growth to come from the use of
much more aluminium in cars. The amount of the metal in the average car has
doubled from 32kg (70 1/2 lbs) in the late 1970s to 68kg (150 lbs) and even
the most conservative industry forecasts see it doubling again by 2010.
In the US this trend is being driven by ever-tightening fuel economy targets
set by the government. Aluminium's light weight enables car makers to meet
these targets without reducing the size of their vehicles. In Europe the
move to aluminium has much to do with recycling  - its relatively high value
makes it the ideal recyclable material.
Recession in much of the industrialised world has restricted demand since
1990, but even so last year aluminium consumption in the west still rose 2.9
per cent to 15.4m tonnes. Spurred into action by this gap between supply and
demand, producers since 1991 have permanently closed 420,000 tonnes of
capacity and temporarily shut down another 1.52m tonnes.
Therefore the western market would have been in balance and ready to emerge
from the recession from a strong base. But then came an unexpected surge in
imports of metal from the CIS, from 200,000 tonnes before 1990 to about 1m.
The availability of all this CIS metal testifies to the stark contrast in
conditions in the former Soviet Union and western markets.
About half the aluminium produced in the CIS was delivered to military and
aerospace customers. The unfreezing of the cold war has seen that particular
demand virtually disappear. Mr Horst Peters, general manager, technology
marketing at VAW, suggests aluminium consumption in Russia alone dropped
from 2.6m tonnes in 1998 and 1.8m tonnes last year.
Shortages of aluminium developed in the republics because Russia and some
other parts of the CIS can produce top-quality aluminium which is readily
converted into dollars.
Some western observers were convinced that chaotic conditions and raw
materials shortages would cut CIS aluminium output substantially last year.
But international traders stepped in with barter deals to keep the industry
going. For example, Mr Alan Bekhor, managing director of Trans-World Metals,
says his company, which claims to be the biggest trader of CIS aluminium,
helped 'kick-start' production at two smelters by providing cash to improve
the flow of alumina, an essential raw material. Trans-World also invested in
port facilities in the far east of Siberia to bring alumina into the CIS and
get aluminium out.
VAW's Mr Peters points out that the low technical standard at many CIS
smelters - most of them use out-dated Soderberg technology - enables their
own workshops to make spare parts to keep the equipment operating.
Consequently, CIS aluminium production last year was fairly stable and, at
2.7m tonnes, only 10 per cent below the 2.9m tonnes achieved in 1988.
What does this add up to if the east and west industries are combined? It is
clear that another 1.5m tonnes of production capacity - equivalent to six
modern smelters - needs to be shut if supply is to be brought back into
balance with demand.
The need for a structural change of this size was bound to create tension in
the industry. This boiled over in August when the European Commission ruled
that the very fast growth in aluminium imports from the CIS had caused
'serious damage' to EC producers and it imposed some restrictions on
imports.
This action was widely criticised because aluminium is a global commodity
and CIS metal would simply be diverted from the EC to other markets, to be
replaced in the EC with aluminium from other sources. But the Commission did
not expect its restrictions to have much impact on the flow of aluminium
round the world. Its move was a political gesture - one serious enough to
bring the CIS producers to the negotiating table.
Neither did the Commission believe Europe should act in isolation. It always
wanted other big aluminium producing countries to take part in discussions
about the problems caused by CIS metal. It achieved these initial objectives
and a series of multilateral discussions, involving CIS producers and trade
representatives from the EC, Canada and the US, are to take place this
autumn.
The EC has been emphasising at initial meetings with the CIS producers the
two-way nature of its proposals. In exchange for some CIS export restraint,
European producers would be willing to help modernise the CIS industry, to
help launch new semi-fabricated and fabricated products to stimulate demand
for aluminium in the republics and the Community might possibly find some
cash to help this process.
Part of the Commission's explanation for restricting CIS imports (to 60,000
tonnes between August and the end of November) was: 'Aluminium produced in
the CIS enjoys the huge advantage of artificially low energy prices and
environmental standards that are far less strict than those in western
countries.'
Nobody disputes that environmental standards in most CIS smelters are
appalling. If Russia's own regulations were imposed all its smelters would
close down.
As for costs, the Russians claim they produce aluminium for about Dollars
500 a tonne. But energy costs have been heavily subsidised and labour rates
range from one US cent to two cents a lb - less than those in most
developing countries.
Industry consultant Mr Anthony Bird estimated half-way through 1992 that,
aided by these 'astonishly low' input prices, CIS smelters were producing
aluminium for about 25 US cents a lb (about Dollars 550 a tonne) - well
below the 53.6 cents average for smelters in the rest of the world.
But the outlook for the CIS industry is changing. Under pressure from the
International Monetary Fund the Russian government is trying to lift energy
prices to the international level in stages. And, according to VAW's Mr
Peters, an energy price increase the government has recently been attempting
to impose would raise the operating costs of the republic's smelters to an
average of Dollars 1,200 a tonne, well above the recently-prevailing
international price.
Smelters unable to cover their costs would quickly have to close because
they could not pay for raw materials, he said. In any event,'cost pressures
will force CIS smelters to modernise or to close'.
Those cost pressures, particularly from rising energy prices, are also being
felt in the west. It was only a matter of time before the high-cost smelters
in central Europe shut permanently to leave the business to countries with
low-cost and renewable hydro-electric power, such as Canada and Venezuela.
The prolonged period of extremely low prices the industry is presently
enduring is simply speeding up the process.
Low prices and the turmoil caused by CIS imports are also holding back
investment in new smelter projects in the west. Banks would want to see the
aluminium price at between Dollars 1,600 and Dollars 1,700 a tonne - nearly
50 per cent above recent depressed levels - before offering loans for new
smelters, according to Mr Louis Vincinguerra, a general partner at Banque
Rothschild in France. Only at that level would new smelters cover their full
costs. He suggests that prices would return to the necessary levels if the
industry - east and west - closed 1.5m tonnes of annual capacity. Eastern
European producers should contribute to these cuts, he says. 'They must
learn that it is better to sell less aluminium at significantly higher
prices.'

FT  19 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome advances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The halting of supplies in Japan of Usevir, a herpes and shingles treatment
that is the only licensed rival to Wellcome's Zovirax, added to positive
sentiment surrounding the UK company.
The suspension of Usevir, marketed by US group Bristol-Myers Squibb, came
after the deaths of three patients. One analyst said that although it was
only used in severe cases, as against the more generally used Zovirax, its
troubles are bound to buoy the fortunes of both Wellcome and SmithKline
Beecham.
And it will also further focus investors' eyes on Wellcome's conference in
New Orleans at the end of this week during which the company will reveal
test data for herpes treatment drug Valaciclovir - the rival to SmithKline's
Famciclovir.
Another boost for drugs stocks came via good results from US company Merck,
thought to show a positive trend in the market.
Wellcome rose 10 to 766p and SmithKline 'A' firmed 2 to 405p. Glaxo gained
12 at 681p and Medeva put on 4 at 123p.
A smaller move came for Smith &amp; Nephew, which gained  3/4 at 138 1/4 p.
However, the rise goes against a downward trend triggered by results a
couple of months ago. Some of the investor interest in the tightly traded
stock was put down to good results from US Surgical, which shares many of
Smith &amp; Nephew's markets.
Turnover in environmental services group Rentokil had risen to a hefty 76.7m
shares by the close after SG Warburg, the company's broker, placed two large
blocks of shares.
Danish investment group Sophus Berendsen sold a block of 29m shares,
reducing its stake to around 52 per cent, although it said it would not sell
any more in the next year, while KG Anker-Petersen Will Trust sold 11m
shares. Warburg was understood to have bought the stock at 202p and placed
the majority of it with institutions at 204p. Rentokil settled a net 2
lighter at 209p.
The wave of optimism for a cut in German interest rates brought a bounce to
RMC and Redland. Interest in RMC may also benefit from a trip later this
week for analysts and investors to some of its German operations.
Forecasts remain positive in Germany for both companies irrespective of
interest rate cuts, according to one analyst. While prospects for
development in the west of the country may recede, they will be matched by
opportunities in the east.
RMC has a strong interest in Berlin which will be rewarded if the
government's base is moved from Bonn.
RMC moved ahead 10 to 816p and Redland added 16 at 545p.
The buoyant Hong Kong equity market continued to benefit several stocks in
the UK market. These included HSBC, which brushed aside news of a Pounds
172m court judgment against its merchant bank subsidiary Samuel Montagu. The
shares closed 7 ahead at 763p. TSB put on 3 1/2 at 221 1/2 p, with Strauss
Turnbull said to have recommended the stock.
Water issues, among the best performers in recent sessions, were subject to
mild profit-taking, Welsh Water receding 8 to 646p. NatWest reiterated its
preference for the Recs over the waters, arguing that regulatory worries in
the former were less and yield attractions better. The broker particularly
likes South Wales, up 5 at 638p in a strong electricity sector.
Weekend press comment inflamed more interest in the telecoms sector,
Vodafone climbing 12 1/2 to 571 1/2 p and Cable and Wireless 7 to 974p.
Fears of even worse news from construction and engineering group Trafalgar
House when it reports figures in December led to a 9 per cent slide in the
shares after it surprised the market with some disappointing news and a
Pounds 400m convertible preference rights issue.
Trafalgar not only announced its third cash call in the last two years, but
also said there would be further property writedowns, and warned that
full-year figures would be 'somewhat short' of current market expectations.
Dealers rushed to sell the shares and they dropped 11 1/2 to 85p in heavy
trading which brought volume of 16m. Among a welter of profits downgrades,
Strauss Turnbull moved its estimate for the year to September 1993 from a
loss of Pounds 65m to a deficit of Pounds 170m.
Interest in Shell Transport was largely put down to the performance of Royal
Dutch on foreign markets. The former's shares moved ahead 11 1/2 to 700 1/2
p in turnover of 3.6m.
Standard &amp; Poor's reaffirmation of its rating on Lasmo had little effect on
the shares, unchanged at 141p in healthy volume of 4.3m. S &amp; P similarly
confirmed its rating on Enterprise Oil, which continues to enjoy market
favour and appreciated 3 to 490p.
In a dull leisure sector, Forte recovered last week's losses on the back of
its well-received deal to manage the Ciga group of hotels. The shares
improved 4 to 225p, although turnover was a below par 1.4m.
Caterer Compass Group was hit by talk that rival Gardner Merchant was
suggesting that tighter margins were being experienced in the industry. One
seller sold 250,000 shares at around 569p. The stock closed 12 off at 570p.
Euro Disney's announcement of 950 job losses and possible further management
changes helped the shares edge forward 10 to 620p.
Talk of good sales and firm margins again circulated around Marks and
Spencer and the shares firmed a penny to 405p, with Hoare Govett lifting its
current profits forecast from Pounds 825m to Pounds 860m.
Speculation that next month's UK Budget would include defence cuts weakened
related stocks. The day's casualties included engineering group Vickers, 4
cheaper at 152p, Vosper Thornycroft, also 4 lower, at 687p, and VSEL, which
retreated 10 to 835p.

The day's biggest slide among FT-SE 100 stocks was recorded in British
Aerospace, where the shares dropped 16 to 406p on a combination of nervous
trading ahead of today's board meeting at Taiwan Aerospace Corporation and
worries about cuts in defence spending.
The meeting in Taiwan will decide the future of the proposed Pounds 250m
regional jets joint venture, which the two sides have been negotiating for
well over a year. Talks are said to have stalled over the issue of transfer
of technology.
Dealers were also concerned about talk that sweeping cuts in defence
expenditure would be announced in next month's budget. One analyst said:
'British Aerospace can almost afford to lose the Taiwan deal, though clearly
it would not be a good thing. However, it cannot afford a significant
setback in its defence division.'

FT  19 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: New faces hint at WH Smith

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMMINENT executive changes at WH Smith were being strongly tipped in the
market ahead of the retailer's agm tomorrow. The shares advanced on the
talk, which was further encouraged by a company progress report on plans to
rationalise Do It All, the home improvement joint venture with Boots. The
latter slipped 3 to 511p, while Smith 'A' added 9 at 469p.
Most interest was stirred by suggestions that Smith will appoint a
heavyweight director to beef up aspects of the company's retail operations.
There was also some speculation that chairman Sir Simon Hornby will announce
his retirement, although analysts were mostly sceptical.
Meanwhile, Boots and Smith said that talks were continuing over how many DIY
stores are to be closed as part of its review of their loss-making Do It All
business. The venture has around 220 stores, of which 82 are being converted
to a new format which it is claimed produces higher sales. Of the remaining
138, market sources suggest around 60 will be axed. Boots and Smith are said
to be confident that up to two-thirds of those under threat of closure will
be sold to other retailers.
However, many stores analysts, who are pencilling in losses this year of
more than Pounds 30m for Do It All, remain unconvinced of the venture's
long-term future.

DERIVATIVES trod a measured but reasonably firm path, with much of Friday's
vigour having dissipated and hopes of an imminent interest rate cut fading,
writes Christine Buckley.
The December contract on the FT-SE 100 started at 3,149 and mustered a small
rally which was knocked back by a slightly higher than expected public
sector borrowing requirement.
Some momentum came back to the market ahead of Wall Street's opening and the
contract reached its day's high of 3,167. But with the US market proving a
little soggy the contract then began to drift back although it kept ahead of
its premium to the cash market.
Some long positions by dealers added a technical acceleration to the
contract's afternoon slide.
Further brakes came from lacklustre gilts and short sterling.
The contract ended at 3,156 which was 4 points up on its fair value premium
to cash which is taken at about 15 points. At 7,235 contracts, the volume
was moderate.
Index options continued to prove a strong part of traded options with much
activity in December puts on the FT-SE 100 option. The move into December
FT-SE options a sign of hedging in readiness for the Budget.
Of the total traded options volume of 37,913 lots, 18,693 was in the FT-SE
100 and 2,485 in the Euro FT-SE.

FT  19 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 100 hits another record high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK equity market shrugged aside momentary disappointment with the
September public sector borrowing requirement figure and raced ahead to hit
a new intraday and closing high as the new two-week trading account got
under way.
Yesterday's burst of enthusiasm in the London market came as dealers picked
up the scent of a possible round of European interest rate cuts. These could
be triggered by good news on German money supply figures which may lead to a
reduction in German rates when the Bundesbank meets this Thursday.
Prime rate cuts by some US banks helped sentiment but dealers saw little
real significance in these moves, which they said had been signalled a
couple of weeks ago.
The FT-SE 100 Index touched an all-time high of 3,142.8, up 22 points,
shortly after midday, but failed to maintain its upwards momentum as a
slightly disappointing opening by Wall Street and an easier trend in
international bond markets prompted a minor flurry of profit-taking in
equities. The index was finally 16.8 higher on balance at a closing peak of
3,137.6.
London was additionally driven by a growing feeling that the November 30
Budget may see the chancellor of the exchequer opt for modest tax increases
coupled with a cut in UK interest rates. One market strategist said the
market could be indulging in a 'classic pre-Budget run-up', but also pointed
out that London had underperformed other European bourses yesterday, most of
which rose around one percentage point, against the Footsie's rise of around
 1/2 percantage point. He described London's performance as 'nervous but
positive'.
Dealers were reluctant to lift share prices too far at the outset yesterday,
worrying that the Footsie's 34-point jump to a new peak last Friday could
have led to a period of consolidation as the new account commenced. However,
a burst of futures-led buying saw the index climb from an opening gain of
around five Footsie points to its midday peak. The afternoon downturn was
regarded as nothing more than minor profit-taking. 'We've had a weekend to
calm down after Friday's big upward move but this market is not ready to
come back; the quality of buying is far too good for that,' commented a
senior marketmaker at one of the top UK securities houses.
Figures released yesterday by the Stock Exchange showed that the value of
customer business transacted last Friday reached Pounds 1.86bn, the highest
since August 25, when the big US investment funds were said to have launched
a major foray into the UK market.
Turnover in equities totalled 665.8m shares, with that figure boosted by a
placing of 40m Rentokil shares by SG Warburg Securities. The latter's shares
were outstanding in a generally strong merchant banking sector.
Stocks with substantial interests in Hong Kong basked in the reflection of
exceptional gains registered by that market, with HSBC firm despite its
merchant banking subsidiary Samuel Montagu being ordered to pay Pounds 172m
in damages and interest to creditors of British &amp; Commonwealth, the failed
financial services group. Cable &amp; Wireless, boosted by yet more big US
support after the recent Dollars 22bn Bell Atlantic/Tele-Communications
merger, was heavily traded.

FT  19 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow climbs as blue chips see
demand
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US SHARE prices ended a busy session mixed yesterday as blue chip issues
decisively outperformed secondary stocks for the first time in several
weeks, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 12.58 at
3,642.31. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 shed 1.08 to 468.42
and the Nasdaq composite dipped 4.51 to 782.91. NYSE volume was 329.5m
shares.
After last week's late gains, which were prompted by a sharp decline in bond
yields and good news on inflation, stock markets opened with little firm
direction yesterday. The absence of fresh economic data also contributed to
the listless nature of early trading.
Initially, the overnight gains recorded on foreign markets were regarded as
a positive factor for sentiment; but that was subsequently more than offset
by early losses on the US bond market, which quickly fed through into
equities.
Last week, all the secondary indices set record highs, and the Dow climbed
to within almost 30 points of its all-time peak. Against that background,
traders were not surprised when, at the opening, some investors chose to
book some of the profits they had earned last week. Blue chip stocks,
however, firmed steadily through the afternoon, aided by some good earnings
news.
Banks were in retreat, hit by profit-takers, rising bond yields and the news
that JP Morgan's Morgan Guaranty unit had reduced its prime lending rate
from 6 per cent to 5.5 per cent. JP Morgan fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 74
5/8 , Citicorp weakened Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 35 5/8 , Chemical gave up
Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 41 7/8 and BankAmerica declined Dollars 1 1/2 to
Dollars 43 1/8 .
Chase Manhattan retreated Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 34 1/8 in spite of
reporting third-quarter net income of Dollars 1.25 a share, up from 94 cents
a year ago. NationsBank, which announced a small decline in earnings to
Dollars 1.33 a share, dropped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 49.
Brokerage stocks lost ground in line with the banks. Merrill Lynch shed
Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 95 7/8 and Salomon Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 47.
Merck rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 32 1/4 in volume of 5.4m shares after
the drug group unveiled quarterly profits slightly better than analysts had
been expecting.
Other big Dow stocks in demand were Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing,
Dollars 2 1/2 stronger at Dollars 107 3/8 , Allied Signal, Dollars 2 1/8 up
at Dollars 73 3/4 , and General Motors, Dollars 1 5/8 ahead at Dollars 46
1/2 . Other auto issues were also higher.
A strong third quarter lifted entertainment group Capital Cities ABC Dollars
11 to Dollars 626.
Canada
TORONTO ended slightly higher in moderate trading as the TSE 300 index
managed to inch to another record level.
The index gained 6.1 at 4,188.7, its third consecutive all-time closing
peak. Advances led declines by 374 to 361 and volume totalled 54.9m shares.
Nine of the 14 sub-indices rose, led by transportation, which jumped 5.0 per
cent as Laidlaw 'B' added CDollars  1/2 at CDollars 8 1/8 . One analyst said
the stock was run up ahead of an analysts' meeting that Laidlaw's new
president and chief executive Mr James Bullock was holding later that day.
The golds group advanced 2.1 per cent as the bullion price gained USDollars
3.40 to USDollars 368.25 an ounce in New York.

FT  19 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt starts week with a
gain of 1 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER gains were seen among continental bourses yesterday as the bull run
showed no sign of flagging, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT closed nearly 1 per cent higher in active trading, although
slightly off its intraday high of 2,043. The DAX index ended up 18.29 at
2,033.32 in turnover of DM9bn.
Nikko Europe in its German market comment noted that any consolidation would
be muted because of 'funds seeking equities given the increasingly lower
yields on deposit. The question is: how much more liquidity is there to come
and when will fundamentals catch up with share prices?'
In spite of a Bundesbank council meeting due this Thursday many market
observers do not expect a further easing in German rates until next month.
The chemical sector attracted particular interest. Robert Fleming in London
has recently put out a buy recommendation on Bayer and Degussa and noted
that positive signs for the sector included: accelerated cost cutting and
first signs of improving polymer prices as European surplus capacity is
syphoned off by recovering demand in the US. Bayer and Degussa added DM2.30
and DM13.20 respectively to DM313.70 and DM406.50.
ZURICH reached a seventh consecutive record high with the SMI index adding
51.0 or 1.9 per cent to 2,663.6, with the advance again based on a firm
dollar and hopes of lower interest rates.
Sandoz, which reported nine month figures last Thursday, rose SFr115 or 3.2
per cent to SFr3,670 as Mr Marc Freudweiler at Credit Suisse noted that the
share had underperformed recently and recommended that investors take
advantage of the current low price.
CS Holding added SFr85 to SFr3,350. Merrill Lynch commented recently that it
was the most modestly valued of the big three Swiss banks and the furthest
from potential peak earnings. This year's windfall profits would bolster its
capital base and it was the only one of the three that appeared undervalued
in a European context.
PARIS fell back slightly from midsession highs but the CAC-40 index still
managed a day's gain of 5.73 to 2,144.99.
There was tremendous activity in BNP stock on its first day of trading after
privatisation, and at one stage the shares were suspended briefly after
breaking through a 15 per cent fluctuation band. The shares finally closed
at FFr283.90.
The government also confirmed that Rhone-Poulenc will be the next major
privatisation issue, following suggestions last week that Elf-Aquitaine,
also confirmed as number three, might move up the list. The two closed
respectively up FFr2.40 and FFr6.50 at FFr145.50 and FFr434.00.
MILAN followed in the wake of Fiat's strong performance and the Comit index
rose 12.29 or 2.1 per cent to 589.88.
Mr Gian Luca Manca of Robert Fleming Securities noted that the market was
also supported by expectations of lower interest rates and a waning of
recent worries over liquidity.
Heavy foreign and domestic buying took Fiat L172 or 4.5 per cent higher to
L4,000 in continued response to the rights issue last Friday.
Italmobiliare, also making a capital call this month, rose L1,595 or 5.1 per
cent to L32,995.
Montedison climbed L31 to L831 in spite of continuing uncertainty over the
rescue plan.
AMSTERDAM remained in positive territory with the heavyweight international
stocks all performing well. The CBS Tendency index advanced 1.3 to 132.1.
BRUSSELS played the interest rate theme with the Bel-20 index ending at a
new record high, up 10.19 at 1,381.05 in turnover of some BFr1.7bn.
VIENNA put on more than 3 per cent helped by the bullish mood elsewhere on
the continent. The ATX index closed up 33.73 at 1,077.56, its highest level
since early March 1992.
The Nordic markets all showed gains with OSLO's All share index at a new
three year high, up 9.75 at 599.69. In STOCKHOLM the Affarsvarlden general
index put on 15.90 to 1,397.80 in spite of a fall in Ericsson, down SKr4 to
SKr466 in the B shares. COPENHAGEN's KFX index broke the 100 barrier,
closing up 0.69 at 100.56.
ISTANBUL added to Friday's losses with a fall in the composite index of
258.8 to 14,935.3.

FT  19 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: Global equity markets step up a gear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With few exceptions the world's equity markets stepped up a gear last week,
leading to a fresh spate of record highs. The FT-Actuaries World Index rose
1.2 per cent, with the best gains coming from the Far East and Latin
America.
Nomura's global strategy team, writing at the end of last week, commented
that further sharp rises were likely in the South-east Asian markets,
'driven by an absence of sellers as much as by the (huge) weight of money
still trying to get into the market'.
US money has been largely responsible for the bull run in this part of the
world (while also contributing to rises elsewhere, particularly in Europe);
and yesterday Hong Kong put on a further 3.1 per cent on top of Friday's
close.
Morgan Stanley has recently become an aggressive promoter of this market,
seeing it also as a gateway to China. Mr David Roche, global strategist,
commented last week that 'Hong Kong's expanding prospective price/earnings
multiple, which on 1993 earnings is now around 16 times, can be seen as a
consequence of the lower political risk'.
He added: 'Eventually we expect the Hong Kong market to trade at multiples
representative of the Asian region as a whole, typically 20 to 25 times
prospective 1993 earnings, especially in light of its superior earnings
growth prospects for this year and next.'
In Europe, Italy and France were exceptions to the upward trend. The Milan
equity market was pushed lower ahead of the close of the account last Friday
and, more importantly, selling ahead of the Fiat rights issue, which came to
the market also on Friday.
Paris spent the week partly in expectation of further interest rate
reductions, which failed to materialise. The UBS global research team has
noted that 'with downgrading of 1994 GDP forecasts, hopes for recovery are
fading and French equities are increasingly dependent on an early cut in
rates'.

FT  19 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei edges lower as
region continues to set records
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PROFIT-TAKING and arbitrage selling depressed share prices, and the Nikkei
average lost ground in spite of early morning buying by life insurers and
public funds, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index ended 102.21 off at 20,072.21, having firmed in the
morning, led by continued strength in telecommunications shares, to a day's
high of 20,265.53. However, index-linked selling pushed down prices and the
average hit the day's low of 20,071.51 just before the close.
Volume came to 222.3m shares, against 338m. Falls led rises by 620 to 340,
with 205 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed
5.32 to 1,648.69, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 2.07 at
1,282.60.
In the morning, financial institutions bought high-technology issues due to
the lower yen, while traders sought telecommunications stocks on news of the
merger between Bell Atlantic, of the US, and Tele-Communications Inc, the US
cable television operator.
However, slow trading in the afternoon prompted profit-taking. Index-linked
selling also depressed share prices as stock futures traders, discouraged by
a fall in bond prices, liquidated positions.
Construction companies, battered by the recent spate of bribery scandals,
fell on small-lot selling. Obayashi weakened Y15 to Y660 and Taisei declined
Y14 to Y665.
Mazda Motor dipped Y3 to Y453 on selling by foreign investors. Profit-taking
depressed large-capital issues, with Nippon Steel easing Y2 to Y327 and
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Y1 to Y682.
The yen's decline against the dollar supported some export-oriented
high-technology issues. Matsushita Electric Industrial rose Y10 to Y1,500.
Aiwa jumped Y180 to Y1,780 on favourable earnings reports, while Sony, its
parent company, gained Y190 at Y4,800.
Telecom-related shares were higher. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose
Y4,000 to Y910,000, Fujitsu, the most active issue of the day, firmed Y1 to
Y867 and Oki Electric advanced Y8 to Y563. DDI, the long-distance telecom
company listed on the second section, closed unchanged at Y6.78m after
hitting a record high of Y6.96m during the morning.
In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 82.12 to 22,245.79 in volume of 18.7m
shares.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets maintained their record-setting ways. In Bombay, brokers
continued a strike that has shut down the bourse after a judge delayed
settlement of a dispute over shares, seized by tax authorities investigating
a securities scandal.
HONG KONG continued to break new ground, with unceasing demand by large and
small investors taking the Hang Seng index 267.15, or 3.1 per cent, higher
to a record 9,031.13, after a day's peak of 9,053.98.
The market breached 8,000 just eight trading sessions ago and is up 63.9 per
cent so far in 1993. Turnover was a provisional HKDollars 10.20bn, compared
with HKDollars 9.09bn on Friday.
On the futures exchange the October Hang Seng futures contract closed at a
strong premium to the market at 9,145, up 325 points, and November and
December contracts both finished at 9,150.
Star performers were Jardine Matheson, HKDollars 4 higher at HKDollars
73.50, HSBC, up HKDollars 2.50 at HKDollars 90, and Wharf Holdings,
HKDollars 2.10 ahead at HKDollars 27.40.
AUSTRALIA established another six-year peak in spite of some profit-taking
in afternoon trade. The All Ordinaries index added 11.4 at 2,085.5 after an
intraday high of 2,086.4. BHP, 24 stronger at ADollars 17.68, and News Corp,
16 cents ahead at ADollars 11.80, both continued to set all-time highs.
NEW ZEALAND registered a new four-year peak, with the strength of foreign
markets helping to support prices. The NZSE-40 capital index climbed 14.79
to 2,087.34 in moderate turnover of NZDollars 29.48m.
Most leaders posted modest gains, while selected smaller issues were very
strong, especially in the publishing sector.
MANILA finished at a record high as buying of PLDT continued to buoy the
market and offset profit-taking.
The composite index was up 12.70 at 2,187.95 after touching 2,216.08. PLDT
rose 35 pesos to 1,850 pesos.
TAIPEI closed higher for the seventh consecutive day, on a late wave of
buying in financials. The weighted index, little changed for much of the
session, ended 30.31 up at 4,061.47 in active trade of TDollars 24.3bn.
SINGAPORE moved forward but early gains were pared in a technical correction
after the market hit an intraday peak of 2,145.68. The Straits Times
Industrial index closed 3.19 ahead at 2,116.14.
SEOUL bounced higher at the close on the back of strong foreign and
individual buying of small and medium-capitalisation issues which
neutralised earlier profit-taking. The composite index ended 8.05 up at
747.19.
BANGKOK's SET index fell 4.15 to 1,150.80 after reductions in lending and
deposit rates by leading banks triggered selling of financial stocks.
KUALA LUMPUR halted an eight-session record-setting streak as profit-taking
pulled the composite index 12.93 lower to 914.53.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange: DM eases on repo cut hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN currencies trod water yesterday, gaining slightly against a weaker
D-Mark as investors looked for signs of a more mellow attitude in the
Bundesbank's interest rate policy, writes Peter John.
Economists believe the conditions are now right for a small cut of between 5
and 10 basis points in tomorrow's repo, currently 6.7 per cent. This would
raise hope for cuts in other official rates.
Much will depend on the level of money supply growth. The latest M3 data are
due some time this week, possibly tomorrow, and any figure below 7 per cent
will be taken as an encouraging sign on inflation and interest rates. The
Bundesbank has set a target of 4.5 to 6.5 per cent.
Feelings that lower German rates are back on the agenda combined with the
shifting of big D-Mark positions. Many dealers who had bought the German
currency last week at the expense of the Belgian and French francs were
moving funds into dollars yesterday.
One dealer said: 'However limp the recovery in the US, it is better than in
Europe.'
The strength of the dollar was further helped by a cut in the prime lending
rate by Morgan Guaranty, the US bank, from 6 per cent to 5.5 per cent. Many
investors feel that other banks will follow the lead and pass on the effect
of existing low official rates to customers. The reduction was also seen to
reflect a return to profitability for hard-pressed US banks.
The dollar reached Y107.70 in spite of an increase in the Japanese trade
surplus and closed at Y107.45, up from Y107.05 previously. Against the
D-Mark, the dollar rose to DM1.6270 from DM1.6145. In New York it ended at
DM1.6390 and Y107.43.
It also performed well against sterling, which fell to Dollars 1.4980 from
Dollars 1.5125. The pound was hampered by a disappointing survey on consumer
confidence, which added weight to the belief that a further cut in interest
rates is necessary and might have to be a full percentage point rather than
the half-point cut that many analysts had expected.
Mainland European currencies appeared slightly stronger against the D-Mark
after the strains of last week, but the strength was possibly deceptive.
Many rose in a technical reaction to the strength of the dollar against the
D-Mark, rather than genuine buying.
The French franc closed at FFr3.5350 to the D-Mark, up from FFr3.5410 even
though many are looking for a reduction in the 6.75 per cent intervention
rate on Thursday. The Belgian franc recovered to BFr21.88 against the German
currency, up from BFr21.99, but worries over the economy and impending
social pact were not receding.
Some high-yielding currencies did see buying. The Italian lira, which offers
a return on three-month money of around 8.5 per cent, strengthened to L975.8
against the D-Mark from L982.4. The Swedish krone improved to SKr4.8410 per
D-Mark from SKr4.8751.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Money Markets: UK overnights hit 10%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVERNIGHT money in the UK hit 10 per cent yesterday as the commercial banks
initially ignored the opportunity to provide bills to the Bank of England in
exchange for cash, writes Peter John.
It appeared that banks with liquidity were unprepared to relinquish it,
leaving those which were short of funds having to wait. Even though
overnight rates reached double figures - compared with lows of around 4 per
cent over the past fortnight - the central bank had to provide Pounds 725m
of late assistance at the customary unspecified rate before the shortage was
dealt with.
One dealer said: 'We have had two weeks of cheap money and it seems to have
come to an end.'
The central bank forecast an initial liquidity shortage of around Pounds
1.1bn, later revised to Pounds 1.25bn. Among the main factors affecting the
shortage were the take-up of Treasury Bills and paper maturing in official
hands, which drained Pounds 701m. Bills for repurchase by the market took
out Pounds 1.128bn and bankers' balances below target removed Pounds 295m.
Partly offsetting these, a fall in note circulation injected Pounds 880m.
Meanwhile, growing optimism for European rate cuts was reflected in the
performance of a number of short-term interest rate futures contracts
yesterday, Short sterling continued to edge forward on the view that the
foundations of economic recovery need to be shored by lower rates if the
whole edifice is not to crumble. Turnover was slight but the most active
contract, which expires on December 15, moved up another seven basis points
in early dealing and closed marginally higher at 94.58.
At that level it is discounting three-month money around 5 3/8 per cent and
base rates of 5.5 per cent.
The tightly traded futures contract for Belgian three-month money jumped a
further 36 basis points to 91.87 in spite of the Belgian National Bank's
insistence on keeping its key rate unchanged at 9.65 per cent. Short-term
Belgian lending rates were at 10 per cent on Friday, and above 9 per cent
yesterday when Belgian futures were discounting a one percentage point cut.
German three-month futures were steady, with the market expecting the
Bundesbank to ease its repo rate on Wednesday by at least five basis points.
An easing was further signalled by a decline in call money to around 6.75
per cent from 6.8 per cent.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US drops to third place in farm
aid league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF TANSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD AID for agriculture fell from Dollars 11.7bn in 1980 to just over
Dollars 10bn in 1990 despite continued food crises in the developing
countries, according to a report from the International Food Policy Research
Institute.
The decade saw a complete reversal in the position of the leading bilateral
donors, figures compiled by the Washington-based institute show. The US lost
top spot to Japan as its agricultural aid fell from Dollars 1.4bn in 1980 to
Dollars 388m in 1990 and Japan's grew from Dollars 449m to just over Dollars
1bn in the same period (in 1985 US dollars).
The World Bank is still the biggest single donor at just over Dollars 3bn in
1990, down from nearly Dollars 4.5bn in 1980. France was the second largest
bilateral donor in 1990, with Dollars 527m, and the UK was seventh with
Dollars 201m.
The overall cuts, however, could threaten economic growth and political
stability in volatile regions of the world, the institute warns, because
agriculture forms the economic base for most developing countries.
'Such a decline would be justified if their food situation were improving,
their rural poverty were diminishing, and they were becoming more capable of
meeting their needs for public goods essential for agricultural growth',
says Mr Joachim von Braun, director of IFPRI's food consumption and
nutrition division. 'But in many developing countries the food situation is
deteriorating, rural poverty is increasing and agricultural growth is
stagnating.'
'Africa's poor economic performance throughout the 1980s was partly due to a
neglect of agriculture,' says the institute's director general, Mr Per
Pinstrup-Andersen, who expects to see more of the same in the future if
agricultural development continues to be neglected.
The report warns of substantial risks of large-scale food crises in the
1990s and notes that poor farmers are moving into rain forests, watersheds
and other marginal areas to survive.
IFPRI wants to see research into new agricultural technology to prevent
environmental destruction. 'Such technologies cannot be developed by
individual developing countries alone,' says the report. But if the trend is
to be reversed and sustainable technologies developed then some major
political barriers have to be overcome.
Opposition from farm lobbies in donor countries to agricultural assistance
was one of the political reasons for the decline in aid, according to the
report. The lobbies saw their agricultural industries faced with increased
international competition and lower food prices in world markets. 'Any
agricultural assistance to perceived 'competitors' was attacked,' the report
says.
Changes in the aid organisations themselves and reductions in the numbers of
agricultural specialists in donor agencies are also seen as contributing to
the decline. IFPRI wants to see a strategic alliance between UN agencies and
donor countries to draw attention to agricultural development.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC turns down German farm
currency demand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GERMANY WAS last night told by the European Commission that its demands for
full compensation to its farmers for rises in the D-Mark would not be met,
at the same time as Brussels warned Bonn that its defiance of European
Community limits on the amount of cereals land that can be sown in eastern
Germany was illegal.
EC agriculture ministers failed to agree on changes in the complex
agri-monetary system that adjusts 'green' currencies to keep farm prices
roughly aligned. As a result, the nearly six-week-old freezing of the green
currency grid will remain in place for another month.
Germany wants a full restoration of the 'switchover' system whereby each
realignment of EC currencies pushes up every member state's farm prices to
follow the movement of the strongest currencies - invariably the D-Mark and
the Dutch guilder.
Prior to the August 2 decision to float all European exchange rate mechanism
currencies with 15 per cent fluctuation bands, 'switchover' - a device
designed to protect German farmers from the adverse effects on their incomes
of rises in the value of the D-Mark - required a formal realignment of the
ERM, which is now very unlikely.
After August 2, the community initially started adjusting national farm
prices every three trading days, revaluing the 'green' French franc, for
instance, at the expense of German and Dutch farmers. Under severe German
pressure, the commission froze all further changes six weeks ago, and last
week it came out with plans to widen the margins outside which green rate
revaluations are triggered.
Although Germany finds this solution unacceptable, Mr Rene Steichen, EC
agriculture commissioner, yesterday told the Bonn government that 'the
thrust of this proposal will not change'. Only Germany, with lukewarm
support from the Netherlands, resisted the Brussels plan.
After the month-long extension of the freeze, Brussels says it will
reinstate the three-day adjustment system if there is no agreement on its
plan, thereby putting pressure on Bonn to come to terms.
The Bonn-Brussels row over eastern Germany exceeding by nearly 10 per cent
the area of cereals land it is entitled to plant was simmering without
coming to the boil yesterday evening.
Mr Jochen Borchert, the German agriculture minister, said on Friday that
Bonn would not abide by the commission compromise to phase in the automatic
penalties for this overshoot.
Mr Steichen told him 'it is not acceptable to encourage the flouting of
community law' and warned Germany that the commission would take legal
action if it persisted in its 'extreme reaction'.
Germany insists that Brussels miscalculated the total arable area in the
eastern Lander. Under last year's reform of the EC's common agricultural
policy all member states are required to take about 15 per cent of their
previously planted land out of production to curb oversupply.

THE ASSOCIATION of Natural Rubber Producing Countries meets in Bali today
for its annual forum amid renewed hopes that an international rubber
agreement will be negotiated, reports Reuter from Singapore.
But association officials said producers would have to struggle to make
headway in the battle for a new pact. 'It is going to be an uphill task for
producers,' a Malaysian industry official said. 'Consumers are likely to
stick to existing provisions as they are happy with current terms.'
Key rubber consumers led by the European Community and the US have agreed to
renegotiate a new International Natural Rubber Agreement to replace the
existing one, which expires in December. But this is conditional upon
producers agreeing to a 5 per cent cut in the reference price range that
triggers market intervention by the International Natural Rubber
Organisation.
Rubber producers had until early September refused a reference price cut,
saying they would operate a producers-only price stabilisation scheme if
Inra fell apart.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: India meets challenge of locust
invasion - The worst swarms for more than 30 years have been neutralised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA HAS succeeeded in controlling what the ministry of agriculture claims
was the worst locust invasion in more than three decades.
The massive Rs100m (Pounds 2.1m) locust control operation launched early
this year has averted what could have been an agricultural crisis of
frightening dimensions, with India's richest agricultural land under threat.
The Indian government is becoming increasingly concerned, however, that
locusts are not being adequately dealt with in the Red Sea area, where they
originate.
India, with its 200,000 square kilometres of desert, forms the eastern-most
edge of the world's biggest scheduled desert area and is particularly
vulnerable to the locust menace. Beyond the deserts of Rajasthan and Gujarat
lies the country's richest agricultural belt, spanning the Punjab and
beyond.
The civil wars in Sudan and Somalia have hampered international locust
prevention operations and the voiracious insects, which breed mainly in the
desert areas of Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Somalia, have this year travelled
east to India from breeding grounds in Yemen and Oman, across the Arabian
Sea via Pakistan.
The first mature yellow locusts, 62 swarms of them, flew into the Kutch and
Rajasthan desert areas between July 5 and August 23. The agriculture
ministry had anticipated the swarms when the winds came eastward, but had
hoped that Pakistan, with the help of the UN's Food and Agriculture
Organisation, had managed to kill most of them before they could fly into
India.
Ministry officials complain, however, that Pakistan failed to warn India
about the magnitude of the swarms. Worse, Indian officials accuse the
Pakistani authorities of conciously neglecting the problem, which was
confined to their desert area, knowing it was only a matter of two weeks
before the wind direction changed and the swarms were blown into India.
Officials in the ministry of agriculture say that Pakistan, because of her
strained diplomatic relations with India, did not reveal the extent of the
locust infestation. 'They deliberately withheld information from us, even
lied about the number of swarms,' says a senior official in the ministry of
agriculture. 'They did not warn us nor did they bother to kill the locusts,'
he said.
The second wave of locusts came into India in the last week of August, till
September 20. These 100-odd swarms were not yellow mature locusts, but the
newly-hatched pink hoppers, particularly dangerous because they can fly
nearly ten times faster than adult locusts.
'This year's invasion was more severe than our worst-ever year in 1959-1960,
when the locusts reached Amritsar in the north,' says Mr Inderjit Singh
Malhi, joint secretary in the ministry of agriculture, in charge of plant
protection. 'These swarms were allowed to develop across our western border
(the eggs of the mature yellow swarms were laid in the Pakistani desert) and
are particularly difficult to control because they fly 70-80 km in a single
day, and settle on crops after dusk.'
The pink swarms travelled as far as Jodhpur and Nagaur in Rajasthan, causing
a panic in the area. Fortunately, less than 10 per cent of the area is under
cultivation, and the locusts could be curbed with aerial spraying. The
ministry says there was negligible crop damage because the locusts prefer to
feed off trees. Helicopters were used to spray melathion and fenitrothion,
effectively neutralising the swarms. Only the few locusts that survived at
the periphery of the swarms escaped, regrouping into fresh swarms.
A great depression in central India in mid-September caused a change in wind
direction and the locust swarms invaded Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh, before
being sucked back into Rajasthan.
Political parties campaigning for state assembly elections in November
sought to make locusts an election issue but could not do so because the
operations were so effective. 'The real success of our co-ordinated control
measures is that we have neutralised most of the swarms without any damage
to the crops,' says Mr Malhi. 'We have ensured that new swarms are not
allowed to develop on our soil.'
Officials claim that India's Locust Control Organisation (part of the
agriculture ministry), has been more successful than any other country in
the world in dealing with the menace. Farmers in Rajasthan, and in Fazilka,
Punjab, where the locusts reached in the first week of October, say that the
government measures this time were very effective, compared with 1988, when
the last invasion, a much milder one, occurred. Mr Malhi says his operation
achieved its two objectives - to protect the crops and to ensure that no
reverse migration took place when the wind direction changed last week.
The ministry is now busy with mopping-up operations, with the help of the UN
Food and Agriculture Organisation, and there is no danger of another wind
change till the first week of July. But Mr Malhi says other countries,
especially Pakistan, should co-operate and pool their resources to help
fight the locusts where they originate. 'Otherwise reverse migration occurs,
and then it is too late.'

FT  19 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Placer and Outokumpu in Chilean
copper deal
</HEADLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S PLACER Dome and Outokumpu of Finland are to develop the Zaldivar
copper deposit in northern Chile into a Dollars 600m mine.
Work on the project, recognised as one of the richest undeveloped copper ore
bodies in Latin America, will start immediately. Production is scheduled to
begin in the second half of 1995. The mine is expected to have a life of at
least 17 years.
Placer said yesterday that an updated feasibility study indicated mineable
ore reserves of 246m tonnes with a grade of 1.02 per cent copper. A reserve
suitable for dump-leaching was estimated to contain 70m lb of copper with a
grade of 0.41 per cent. Cash production costs are estimated at 52 US cents a
lb.
Placer and Outokumpu each have a 50 per cent interest in the Zaldivar
deposit. Placer will oversee construction of the mine, while Outokumpu will
market its production. The mine will be managed by a jointly-owned company,
Compania Minera Zaldivar.
The project will be financed by up to Dollars 400m in loan financing from
Placer, plus a capital injection from both partners.
The decision to go ahead with Zaldivar represents a major diversification
for Placer Dome. The Vancouver-based company's interests centre on gold, but
it has recognised for some time the difficulty of replenishing gold reserves
to sustain growth.
A similar attempt to broaden its base two years ago resulted in heavy losses
when Placer wrote off its investment in the Mount Milligan copper deposit in
British Columbia.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK and Argentina begin fish
talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN AND Argentina began two days of talks yesterday to renew a temporary
agreement on sharing fish catches in the South Atlantic. Britain wants to
replace a one-year accord struck last December with a long-term agreement
that protects the Falkland islands' revenues, while Argentina wants to
increase substantially its fishing effort.
The unresolved dispute over the Falklands, which Argentina claims despite
defeat in its 1982 conflict with Britain, charges the talks with
considerable political significance.
Argentina began issuing fishing licences in competition with the Falklands
this year for the first time. Although it agreed in December to sell only 45
licences, it still forced a 12 per cent drop in the islands' licensing
revenues. In the financial year ending in June, the Falklands raised Pounds
23.5m in licensing revenues, compared with Pounds 26.8m in 1991-92.
The Falklands Fisheries Directorate is planning to lower the price of its
licences further and forecasts revenues this year of only Pounds 15m to
Pounds 15.5m.
Argentina also protested against London's decision earlier this year to
extend to 200 miles the territorial waters surrounding the British-held
South Georgia and South Sandwich islands, which Argentina also claims. The
UK has introduced a licensing regime similar to the Falklands for the two
islands.
Buenos Aires is also using the fisheries talks to press for a role in the
development of possible oil and gas reserves in waters surrounding the
Falklands. The islanders have so far rejected oil talks with Argentina and
last year licensed two companies to carry out preliminary seismic surveys.
The islands plan to offer acreage to companies in 1994.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Government Bonds: Profit-takers erode early gains in
European sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN bond markets got off to a strong start this week, buoyed by hopes
for near-term interest rate easing. However, most of the early gains were
eroded by late profit-taking, leaving most markets to end little changed on
the day.
European yield curves have steepened in recent days as investors have begun
to shift into shorter maturities in anticipation of imminent rate cuts.
All eyes are on Germany, where the Bundesbank's next round of securities
repurchase agreements is hoped to bring a small easing.
The Bundesbank is expected to set two-week variable-rate repos today, and
money market traders are anticipating a small drop in the minimum rate from
last week's 6.70 per cent.
While most dealers do not expect the Bundesbank's central bank council to
lower key interest rates at its meeting on Thursday, there was some talk
that lower-than-expected M3 money supply growth and the strength of the
D-Mark could induce the central bank to cut its key 6.25 per cent discount
rate sooner than expected.
The December bund future hit a new high of 100.39 and closed at 100.23, up
0.07 point on the day.
LONGER-dated UK gilts were dragged down by weakness in other markets, but
the shorter maturities were underpinned by hopes for a near-term cut in the
UK base rate to stimulate the economy.
Investor activity was limited as most participants looked to today's gilt
auction announcement. Most traders expect the Bank of England to announce
Pounds 3bn to Pounds 3.25bn five-year bonds as the new intermediate
benchmark for 1994.
FRENCH bond futures hit a new high in the morning but slipped after the Bank
of France again left its intervention rate unchanged at 6.75 per cent.
The December contract peaked at 123.74 but slipped back to 123.48, down 0.06
point on the day.
ECU bonds had a strong day, with the Ecu contract on Matif gaining 0.22
point to 119.80. Ecu bonds have rallied sharply since last week's approval
of the Maastricht treaty on European monetary union by Germany's
constitutional court.
EUROPE's high-yielders put on another strong performance. The Spanish Bonos
future in Madrid rose 0.30 point to 102.80, while the Italian BTP contract
on Liffe fell 0.35 off its peak to end at 118.55, up 0.11 point.
US Treasury prices eased sharply at the long end of the market as investors
took some of the profits earned in last week's inflation-inspired rally. In
late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  27/32 at 105
9/16 , yielding 5.848 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was down
 3/32 at 100 1/16 , to yield 3.824 per cent.
Trading was quiet from the start as investors and traders set about
consolidating the gains earned last Thursday and Friday after government
figures were released showing inflation remained subdued in September. That
consolidation involved some profit-taking, which contributed to the early
declines at the long end.
Some analysts said that a morning newspaper article claiming that several
large well-known fund managers had gone short of bonds in anticipation of a
market correction was also behind the losses, while others pointed to the
decision by banking group Morgan Guaranty to cut its prime lending rate from
6 per cent to 5.5 per cent as another contributing factor.

FT  19 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: IRS to ease tax rules on
hedging transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Internal Revenue Service has issued regulations that will allow hundreds
of US businesses to count gains and losses from hedging transactions as
ordinary income for tax purposes, rather than capital gains, which are taxed
at a higher rate.
The decision represents a defeat for the agency, which since 1988 has
attempted to collect taxes on hedge transactions, which are used for risk
management purposes by industries as diverse as farming, banking, and
energy, at the higher rate. Its actions were based on a 1988 supreme court
ruling in a case called Arkansas Best, which reversed 40 years of tax
practice in the treatment of contracts used to protect business risks.
The IRS also issued a temporary regulation which will give immediate relief
to companies embroiled in disputes with the agency over its method of hedge
taxation. They include giants like General Motors, which uses hedging to
protect itself from foreign currency and interest rate risk, and Ralston
Purina, which produces cereal products and animal feeds, and hedges its raw
materials costs with forward contracts and futures transactions.
The regulations are also a relief to the nation's futures exchanges, where
many hedge transactions are executed. 'It looks as if Treasury has
recognised hedging is a legitimate business expense,' said Mr Jerrold
Salzman, outside counsel to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
The IRS turnround follows a June 17 tax court ruling involving the Federal
National Mortgage Association. That ruling gave tax relief in limited cases,
but could not be broadly interpreted. The new IRS regulations are much
broader, and are an important step toward rationalising the tax treatment of
hedging transactions, said Mr Patrick Arbor, Chicago Board of Trade
chairman.

FT  19 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: Goldman Sachs, Mitsui in
derivatives venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOLDMAN Sachs and Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance have established a joint
venture for trading derivative instruments. Goldman Sachs Mitsui Marine
Derivative Products, rated triple-A by Standard &amp; Poor's, opened for
business yesterday.
The move follows a trend set by Merrill Lynch and Salomon Brothers, which
established separately-capitalised derivatives units with top credit ratings
to combat the competitive disadvantage of their relatively weak credit
ratings.
The lucrative Dollars 4,000bn market in over-the-counter swaps and options
is extremely credit-sensitive, as many clients are limited to dealing with
counterparties rated double-A and above.
'We were certainly missing out on some business, although the vast majority
of clients' were happy to deal with Goldman, said Mr Jacob Goldfield, a
Goldman partner and president of the joint venture. He added that 'the world
may be moving so that we need this to stay competitive'.
Goldman's approach breaks the pattern set by its US rivals, by using a
partner to ensure a stronger credit rating, rather than relying on its own
capital.
The new company is 50 per cent owned by each partner, with initial
capitalisation of Dollars 75m provided equally. The joint venture is backed
by both companies, but it is the support of triple-A rated Mitsui Marine
which ensured the top rating by S&amp;P.
Goldman has made limited use of two existing special purpose vehicles for
derivatives in existence. 'The other vehicles could have been used for this
purpose, but we chose to wait for this one,' said Mr Goldfield.

A FUND giving foreigners other than Gulf Arabs their first chance to invest
in the Kuwaiti stock market is shortly to be launched, Reuter reports from
Kuwait City.
A prospectus for the KD25m (Dollars 82m) First Investment fund is to be
issued by Kuwait Foreign Trading Contracting and Investment.
The emirate's exchange is enjoying a modest revival following agreement on a
mechanism for solving a Dollars 19bn bad debt problem. An unofficial index
published by the al-Shall economic consultancy puts share prices 9 per cent
above their level on the eve of Iraqi's invasion in August 1990.
Minimum participation would be 10 units out of a total 2.5m units available,
with a nominal price of 10 dinars a unit.
The launch of the fund is in line with privatisation plans announced last
year to sell off the government's stakes in 66 local companies.

offering
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE World Bank is expected to launch its first D-Mark global bond offering
today. The DM3bn issue, via Deutsche Bank and Salomon Brothers, is likely to
have a 10-year maturity and be priced tomorrow.
The World Bank has already said that the bonds will be priced to yield
single digits over the underlying German government bonds. The indicated
price range being talked about in the market yesterday was five to seven
basis points.
Some syndicate managers said that a yield spread of less than five basis
points could limit the success of the deal because it would leave little
room for the bonds to outperform.
Turkey also tapped the D-Mark sector late yesterday with a DM1bn five-year
issue, via DG Bank. The bonds were priced to yield 190 basis points over the
5 5/8 bonds due September 1998 issued by Treuhand, the German privatisation
agency.
Turkey raised Pounds 125m in the Eurosterling sector last week through an
issue of 10-year Eurobonds. Syndicate managers took Turkey's swift return to
the Eurobond market as a sign that it was eager to raise as much money as
possible before Moody's, the international rating agency, took a decision on
whether to lower the country's long-term rating from an investment grade to
a speculative grade. Moody's placed Turkey's rating under review for
possible downgrading on October 8.
Elsewhere, Sweden, Dresdner Bank and Treasury Corp of Victoria (TVC)
injected fresh liquidity into the long end of the EuroCanadian dollar,
Eurodollar and Australian dollar sectors, respectively.
Issuers have been keen to tap the demand for long-dated paper but the
pricing of these bonds has often been hindered by the lack of government
benchmarks.
Sweden's CDollars 250m offering of 15-year Eurobonds was priced to yield 28
basis points over the interpolated yield curve.
Dresdner paid 60 basis points over the curve for its Eurobonds which raised
Dollars 200m in subordinated debt. The pricing was broadly in line with
spreads in the secondary market for other 15-year Eurodollar issues launched
earlier in the year. The proceeds of the issue were swapped into
floating-rate dollars.

FT  19 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: Euro-convertible bond in yen
offered by F&amp;C trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN &amp; Colonial Pacific Investment Trust is planning to launch the first
Euro-convertible bond to be issued by a UK investment trust in yen, which it
hopes will raise Y8bn (Pounds 49.2m).
Proceeds will be used to replace existing short-term multi-currency loans of
between Pounds 50m-Pounds 60m, and will enable the trust to reduce its
borrowing costs significantly, according to Mr Eric Elstob, deputy chairman
of the trust.
The seven-year convertible bonds have an annual coupon of 3 per cent and the
conversion premium will be between 15-20 per cent over the share price at
the time of pricing.
The bonds, which are available in bearer or registered form, are aimed at
continental European investors who want exposure to the yen, rather than at
the typical UK private investor.
The trust has gross assets of about Pounds 430m of which 40 per cent are in
Japan so it wants to match its yen liabilities with yen assets.
The bond issue requires approval by shareholders and warrant holders. The
main institutional shareholders include Sun Life and Save &amp; Prosper, with
private individuals accounting for about 30 per cent of the shares.
The trust invests in the Pacific region and shares have recently been
trading at a discount of about 6 per cent to net asset value.
With a coupon of 3 per cent, the trust is paying 'a significantly lower
coupon than if it were to offer a sterling-denominated convertible bond, and
a much lower coupon than for seven-year straight debt,' said Mr Christopher
Purvis at SG Warburg Securities, manager for the issue.

MOODY'S, the US credit rating agency, is reviewing the ratings of Nissan
Motor and its subsidiaries for possible downgrade, affecting about Dollars
9.1bn of securities. The Japanese car company's long-term debt is currently
rated A2 and its commercial paper is rated Prime-A.
The announcement came as Nissan reported a 9 per cent fall in domestic sales
for September, which was its third consecutive year-on-year decline, and a
26 per cent fall in exports in the first half of the fiscal year to
September.
Domestic production also declined 13 per cent in the first half, also a
third consecutive year-on-year decline, partly due to an increase in
overseas production of 22 per cent.
Moody's said that its review would focus on Nissan's ability to respond to
the challenges posed by weakening demand in Japan and on the outlook for new
model introductions by the company. The review will also examine the impact
of the yen's appreciation on profitability in overseas markets and Nissan's
efforts to cut costs and improve efficiency.
Separately, Nissan announced that it is setting up a US logistics company to
handle logistics operations for US-made vehicle parts that are exported to
Nissan factories in Japan and Mexico.
The new facility is scheduled to start operations next April to manage the
procurement of car parts by Nissan in the US.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MCGRAW-HILL, the US publisher and broadcaster, has blamed a extraordinary
charge for a third-quarter net loss of Dollars 91.9m, against profits of
Dollars 59.3m last time, agencies report from New York.
Without the Dollars 160.8m charge, related to the acquisition of partner
Macmillan's share of a joint venture, there would have been net profits of
Dollars 68.93m, a rise of 16.2 per cent.
The company said its Standard &amp; Poor's ratings group, other financial
services businesses, international book publishing, and the Macmillan/
McGraw-Hill School Publishing joint venture all performed well in the
quarter.
The company is buying the half interest in the joint venture owned by the
late Mr Robert Maxwell.
Sales at the group were up slightly to Dollars 554.9m, compared with Dollars
534m for the same period last year.
McGraw-Hill said revenue in its financial services division rose 13.6 per
cent, while operating profit was up 18.4 per cent.
Information and Publication Services revenue fell 5.1 per cent due to
softness in the construction and advertising-based markets, the company
said.
However, cost-controls and improved results at some of its publications
helped produce a 14.6 per cent increase in operating profits in the
division.
The company said its share of the Macmillan/McGraw-Hill joint venture school
publishing company profits rose 10.2 per cent in the quarter.
It said it would recognise for the first time all the costs associated with
the venture, which normally shows a loss in the fourth quarter.

<TEXT>
KIA MOTORS, South Korea's second-largest car producer, yesterday vowed to
fight a possible takeover bid by the Samsung group.
Samsung, one of the country's leading conglomerates, has suddenly emerged as
Kia's second largest corporate shareholder after purchasing large blocks of
stock since June.
'The 9.6 per cent Samsung stake in Kia Motors is a threat to stable
management. I urge Samsung to reduce its stake to the level of early June,'
said Mr Han Seung-jun, president of Kia Motors. Samsung's interest in June
was 5.8 per cent.
He added that Kia employees, who form the company's largest shareholder
block with 11.4 per cent, may try to buy more stock to resist Samsung.
Samsung has expressed an interest in becoming a vehicle manufacturer but
claims the stock purchase by its insurance subsidiary was purely a financial
investment.
'I don't think the massive buying by a life insurer of our company connotes
a normal investment practice as an institutional investor. I can't rule out
the possibility that Samsung intends a hostile takeover of Kia Motors by
increasing its stake,' Mr Han said.
Under current Korean law, Samsung cannot purchase more than 10 per cent of
Kia shares on the stock exchange. But legislation pending in the National
Assembly would abolish the 10 per cent shareholding limit for institutional
investors next year, paving the way for corporate raids.

<TEXT>
BUNDABERG Sugar Company, part of the UK's Tate &amp; Lyle sugar group, is making
a ADollars 87m (USDollars 57.6m) cash offer for two sugar mills in north
Queensland. The mills, which are independent of each other, are
co-operatives and owned by local sugar cane growers.
Bundaberg has proposed to pay just under ADollars 50m for the Tully Mill and
about ADollars 37m for the South Johnstone Mill. It would then spend a
further Dollars 13m on the mills over a two-year period, taking its
investment to ADollars 100m.
However, directors at both mills recommended that the offers be rejected as
inadequate, and said they were hiring legal and financial advisers to
provide further appraisals. Mr Dennis Stevens, general manager of the South
Johnstone Mill, told local news agencies that the company had advised its
270 shareholders that the offer was too low.
Meanwhile, Tully Sugar said its board had decided the offer was
'significantly inadequate as it values our company at less than Dollars 50m.
Our board recommended to shareholders that they take no action,' the company
added.
The offers are conditional on 90 per cent minimum acceptance and to Foreign
Investment Review Board approval. Formal documents, outlining the offer, are
expected to be registered in about one week and circulated to shareholders
shortly afterwards.

FT  19 OCT 93 / International Company News: Retailers count cost of
expansion - The fall in consumer confidence in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QUEUES of customers waiting to buy cheap office workers' uniform blue suits
last month at a discount retailer in Ginza, Tokyo's luxury shopping area,
exemplified the problems facing Japan's retail industry, which is
experiencing the worst fall in consumer confidence this decade.
A fall in real income and rising fears of redundancy are hitting household
spending, and not only are up-market department stores and high-priced
merchandise sales suffering but interim results released in the past week
show leading supermarket chains are also feeling the pinch.
Most supermarkets blamed the bad summer weather and the economic slump for
the fall in profits. However, the supermarkets, which expanded into
retailing expensive merchandise during the late 1980s, are also at fault.
As consumer tastes turned to more expensive merchandise during the economic
'bubble' of the late 1980s, the supermarket chains, looking for fatter
profit margins, expanded their product ranges to items such as clothes,
electronic goods and furniture.
This strategy has backfired amid the current economic slump, and earnings
for the six months to August at the leading supermarkets have sagged. The
retailers blame sluggish sales of clothing, which became a mainstay product
of supermarkets, brought on by the cool summer, but the reality may be that
consumers are turning to discount retailers for cheaper household goods and
electric appliances.
Daiei, Ito-Yokado, and Jusco all saw declines in profits, and are
pessimistic on prospects for the full year. Chujitsuya, a supermarket chain
based in the Tokyo area which will be absorbed by Daiei next year, posted an
interim pre-tax loss of Y1.7bn on a 8.7 per cent fall in sales to Y149.9bn.
Up-market department stores continued to be hit by the increasingly
cost-conscious consumer. Mitsukoshi, which has business ties with Harrods,
posted its first interim pre-tax loss in nine years.
Sogo, which released its interim results yesterday, suffered a 71.4 per cent
fall in pre-tax profits to Y630m on sales down 12.2 per cent to Y126.2bn.
Daimaru reported a 23.7 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to Y1.3bn in spite
of sales of securities, on a 6.5 per cent decline in sales to Y267.8bn.
'Department stores have had the most to lose from the rising popularity of
discount retailers,' says Mr Paul Heaton of *something in here (HP) *
Baring Securities in Tokyo.
Mr Heaton says consumers have discovered that discount retailers are now
offering high quality goods at cheap prices, unlike their previous image of
vendors of low quality cheap goods. According to the local Nihon Kogyo
Shimbun newspaper, men's clothing discounters are expected to post a 19.9
per cent rise in sales for the current business year, compared with a 6.8
per cent rise at supermarkets and a 7 per cent fall at department stores.
Meanwhile, convenience stores continue to enjoy consumer support. Interim
pre-tax profits at Seven-Eleven rose 2.6 per cent to Y46.2bn on sales up 7.5
per cent to Y98.6bn.
Convenience stores, which are open 24 hours a day, have managed to cater to
special needs of consumers. One-third of sales are made between 9pm and 6am.
The sector has managed to cultivate a new group of young urban consumers,
who stay out at night, and has maintained high profit margins by offering
new products.
Supermarkets are now trying to offer cheaper goods by developing their own
brands, while cutting costs by reducing product ranges and spending less on
interior design.
Meanwhile, department stores are attempting to compete with the discount
retailers by drastically cutting prices. One leading department store
recently attracted customers by offering men's silk suits below Y30,000.
For the second half of the fiscal year, retailers hope a return of consumer
confidence will push up sales. However, analysts point out that even if the
economy recovers, profit margins may remain thin as consumers will not
easily go back to the luxury-loving ways of the late 1980s.

FT  19 OCT 93 / International Company News: Nissan ratings under review for
downgrade

<TEXT>
MOODY'S, the US credit rating agency, is reviewing the ratings of Nissan
Motor and its subsidiaries for possible downgrade, affecting about Dollars
9.1bn of securities. The Japanese car company's long-term debt is currently
rated A2 and its commercial paper is rated Prime-A.
The announcement came as Nissan reported a 9 per cent fall in domestic sales
for September, which was its third straight year-on-year decline, and a 26
per cent decline in exports in the first half of the fiscal year to
September. The company's domestic production also declined 13 per cent in
the first half, the third straight year-on-year decline, partly due to an
increase in overseas production of 22 per cent.
Moody's said that its review would focus on Nissan's ability to respond to
the challenges posed by weakening demand in Japan and on the outlook for new
model introductions by the company. The review will also examine the impact
of the yen's appreciation on profitability in overseas markets and Nissan's
efforts to cut costs and improve efficiency.
The credit rating agency is also looking at Nissan's use of local production
facilities to offset pressures of the high yen, the potential implications
for the company's Japanese production facilities, the investment required to
maintain competitiveness in each of its major markets and Nissan's ability
to meet its investment requirements either through internally generated
funds or by increasing indebtedness.
Separately, Nissan announced that it is setting up a US logistics company to
handle logistics operations for US-made auto parts that are exported to
Nissan factories in Japan and Mexico.
The new facility is scheduled to start operations in April to manage the
procurement of car parts by Nissan in the US. Nissan hopes the establishment
of the logistics centre will cut lead times currently required to deliver
US-made parts in half.
The move comes in response to growing US demands that Japanese carmakers buy
more US-made car parts and comes as the US and Japan prepare to face each
other in negotiations over Japanese imports of US autos and auto parts this
week.
Nissan has voluntarily agreed to import Dollars 3.7bn worth of US auto parts
in the fiscal year to March 1995.

limit bank loans

<TEXT>
THE United Arab Emirates has issued rulings limiting the size of loans
offered by banks in the UAE in an attempt to cut their exposure to
potentially major losses, bankers said, Reuter reports from Dubai.
A circular sent to banks at the weekend by the UAE central bank set a limit
on loans equivalent to 7 per cent of a bank's paid-up capital.
The move was part of the central bank's efforts to strengthen the banking
structure in the UAE and bring them within international guidelines, the
bankers said.
'The central bank wants banks to have tighter policies on their large
exposures,' one banker said in reference to the circular.
He said the new regulations would come into force at the beginning of 1994
and would also limit loans to other banks to 30 per cent of a bank's
capital. Loans by branches of international banks to their parent banks
would be limited to 20 per cent, he said.
'I'm sure most of the banks will be affected. They have some major loans to
some big groups,' he said.
But he did not expect the rulings to have a negative impact on businesses in
the UAE.
'They will just have to distribute their liabilities more evenly among the
banks,' he said.
The central bank said last week that a study had shown the main cause of
financial problems suffered by UAE banks were due to 'defaults on big loans
granted by banks to a single borrower or to a group of related borrowers.'

<TEXT>
MR Rupert Murdoch, chairman and chief executive of News Corporation, said he
hoped to remain chief executive of the Australia-based international media
company for another 10 years, AP-DJ reports from Melbourne.
He said he expected that one of his children would take over the role of
chief executive in 10 years time, while he became non-executive chairman. Mr
Murdoch, who is 62, said he felt 'very well'.
'The ideal is I would continue doing what I am doing for another 10 years
and hand over the chief executive role to one of my children and stay as a
tolerant, guiding hand, non-executive chairman,' Mr Murdoch said in answer
to a question about retirement plans.
Asked what would happen if he were to 'fall under the proverbial bus' before
these succession plans are implemented, Mr Murdoch said his wife, Anna,
likely would assume the role of News Corporation chairman.
'I don't see her as being the chief executive of the company,' Mr Murdoch
said in an interview with the Herald Sun, one of News Corp's newspapers.

FT  19 OCT 93 / International Company News: Kia Motors chief urges Samsung
to reduce stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KIA MOTORS, South Korea's second-largest car producer, yesterday vowed to
fight a possible takeover bid by the Samsung group.
Samsung, one of the country's leading conglomerates, has suddenly emerged as
Kia's second largest corporate shareholder after purchasing large blocks of
stock since June.
'The 9.6 per cent Samsung stake in Kia Motors is a threat to stable
management. I urge Samsung to reduce its stake to the level of early June,'
said Mr Han Seung-jun, president of Kia Motors. Samsung's interest in June
was 5.8 per cent.
He added that Kia employees, who form the company's largest shareholder
block with 11.4 per cent, may try to buy more stock to resist Samsung.
Samsung has expressed an interest in becoming a vehicle manufacturer but
claims the stock purchase by its insurance subsidiary was purely a financial
investment.
'I don't think the massive buying by a life insurer of our company connotes
a normal investment practice as an institutional investor. I can't rule out
the possibility that Samsung intends a hostile takeover of Kia Motors by
increasing its stake,' Mr Han said.
Under current Korean law, Samsung cannot purchase more than 10 per cent of
Kia shares on the stock exchange. But legislation pending in the National
Assembly would abolish the 10 per cent shareholding limit for institutional
investors next year, paving the way for corporate raids.
Kia has urged parliament to reject the proposed change in shareholding law.
Samsung's action has caused widespread concern within the Korean corporate
sector, which is characterised by a stable ownership structure and where
corporate takeovers are unheard of.
Kia is considered vulnerable to a bid since its ownership is highly
fragmented, with no single strong shareholder, but some analysts believe
that Ford and Mazda, which own 10 per cent and 8 per cent respectively, and
other institutional investors could co-operate in blocking any Samsung bid.
The government also expressed concern yesterday about the Samsung share
purchase, with finance ministry officials suggesting the state might
intervene by claiming a takeover would violate fair trade and monopoly
rules.

FT  19 OCT 93 / International Company News: Euro-convertible bond in yen
offered by F&amp;C trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN &amp; Colonial Pacific Investment Trust is planning to launch the first
Euro-convertible bond to be issued by a UK investment trust in yen, which it
hopes will raise Y8bn (Pounds 49.2m).
Proceeds will be used to replace existing short-term multi-currency loans of
between Pounds 50m-Pounds 60m, and will enable the trust to reduce its
borrowing costs significantly, according to Mr Eric Elstob, deputy chairman
of the trust.
The seven-year convertible bonds have an annual coupon of 3 per cent and the
conversion premium will be between 15-20 per cent over the share price at
the time of pricing.
The bonds, available in bearer or registered form, are aimed at continental
European investors who want exposure to the yen, rather than at the typical
UK private investor.
The trust has gross assets of about Pounds 430m of which 40 per cent are in
Japan so it wants to match its yen liabilities with yen assets.
The bond issue requires approval by shareholders and warrant holders. Main
institutional shareholders include Sun Life and Save &amp; Prosper.
The trust invests in the Pacific region and shares have recently been
trading at a discount of about 6 per cent to net asset value.
With a coupon of 3 per cent, the trust is paying 'a significantly lower
coupon than if it were to offer a sterling-denominated convertible bond, and
a much lower coupon than for seven-year straight debt,' said Mr Christopher
Purvis at SG Warburg Securities, manager for the issue.

FT  19 OCT 93 / International Company News: The NeXT step in the software
battle - The fighting return of Apple Computer's former head Steven Jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BODIES litter the short history of personal computing: Gary Kildall, who
wrote the first operating system, Dan Fylstra, publisher of the first
electronic spreadsheet and Adam Osborn of the eponymous portable computer,
to name but three.
They are wealthy, but no longer seem very influential in deciding the course
the industry will take.
Mr Steven Jobs, co-founder of Apple Computer and the creator of today's PC
industry, should, by rights, figure among them. Ejected from Apple after a
power struggle with former chief executive Mr John Sculley, his new venture,
NeXT Computer led a precarious existence, culminating in the sale earlier
this year of the hardware side of the business to Canon of Japan.
Only last month he parted ways acrimoniously with its newly appointed chief
operating officer, Mr Peter van Cuylenburg. Harmonious, enduring
relationships with colleagues are not Mr Jobs' strong suit. 'Rough, tough
and intimidating' are some of the kinder adjectives used to describe him.
Yet here he is again. This time trying to convince the corporate world that
NeXT's flagship software Nextstep is the answer to its data processing
problems in the face of competition from the industry giants International
Business Machines, Microsoft, Novell and Apple.
In his favour is the quality of the software itself - Nextstep has attracted
good reviews since its introduction - and his own brooding charisma.
The other side of the 'boss from hell', as Fortune magazine has described
him, is a smooth tongued charmer who does his homework well.
He is candid about mistakes. The NeXT management failed to realise how
quickly prices would fall in the personal computer market.
It also raised too much start-up cash: 'That insulated us from the reality
of giving our customers what they really wanted.'
What every company wants is a way of developing business software in less
than the two to three years traditionally demanded by data processing
departments.
How does NeXT fit the bill? Shorn of its hardware side, it is a software
house. Nextstep was designed to make it easier for companies moving from
expensive centralised mainframe to networks of smaller, less costly
computers to write software specifically for the business.
It is based on Unix, which many believe will be the operating system of the
future, and the technology in Nextstep, object orientation, is undoubtedly
one of the keys to the software of the future. It is a technique which
enables pieces of software to be re-used rather than starting completely
from scratch.
IBM and Apple have a joint venture, Taligent, to develop an object
orientation system; Microsoft's equivalent, code-named 'Cairo', is at least
18 months away from launch.
Mr Jobs believes NeXT is five years ahead of the competition.
'We believe we are going to sell 25,000 copies in the second half of this
year and 100,000 copies next year. We already have 60,000 copies on order,'
he says.
'If we can do that, we will be the world's largest commercial supplier of
Unix systems. Then we will be poised to do what we want to, which is to
provide an alternative to Microsoft. Microsoft will not be able to compete
with us technically. It can compete only on size and scale.'
Microsoft is the world's largest software company with annual sales of close
to Dollars 4bn. NeXT, in its present incarnation, has yet to see a profit.
Yet there are parallels between Mr Jobs' strategy and his earlier
experiences with Apple.
The Apple 11 computer was a hobbyist's toy until accountants realised its
value in creating electronic spreadsheets.
The Apple Macintosh, which introduced 'mice' and 'windows' to the masses,
was in danger of becoming a cult machine until its importance as a vehicle
for desk top publishing became clear.
'This is how we are selling Nextstep' Jobs says. 'In the same way that the
Macintosh was the Trojan Horse of desk top publishing'.
He has trenchant views on the major players in the industry, applauding the
efforts of Hewlett-Packard, the California-based electronics giant.
'I think it has got its act together better than any of the other large
manufacturers,' he says.
He takes a gloomy view of his old company: 'Apple is in serious trouble.
Once it was ahead on vision and technology but Microsoft caught it as if it
was frozen'.
A predictable view perhaps. HP is NeXT's partner in selling Nextstep while
Mr Jobs is still clearly rattled by his expulsion from Apple.
He cannot help but exude schadenfreude at the news that Mr Sculley has
resigned from the company.
Today, few people think Mr Jobs has much chance of establishing Nextstep as
a standard in the industry but his truculent persistence is viewed
affectionately by his peers.
One software specialist said: 'He is a true pioneer and like all pioneers he
takes the arrows in the back.'
Where Mr Jobs differs, it seems, is in resolutely refusing to lie down and
play dead.

FT  19 OCT 93 / International Company News: First Nat'l of Boston sells
Turkish stake
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ANKARA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST National Bank of Boston has sold its 25 per cent stake in Turk Boston
Bank to Oyak, the Turkish armed forces pension fund.
The deal, the value of which was not disclosed, is believed to have raised
around Dollars 7m, and ends the US bank's presence in the Turkish market.
This the second recent decision by a US bank to wind down its Turkish
operation, a measure of the growing maturity of the domestic banks with
which foreigners have to compete. American Express Bank sold its stake in
Koc American Bank to the local Koc industrial group earlier this year. The
bank has since been renamed Koc Bank.
Bank of Boston's move also underlines the growing corporate power of Oyak,
nominally entrusted to handle assets on behalf of the army.
Oyak has a joint venture with Renault in the country's second largest car
assembler, a collaboration with Elf Aquitaine, the French oil company,
controls around 10 per cent of the domestic market, and has a brokerage
house and an insurance company, and now a bank.
The Turk Bank of Boston sale still has to be approved by the treasury. Turk
Bank of Boston announced it is to increase its capital to TL200bn (Dollars
16m). Bank of Boston has also announced a Dollars 50m credit line for its
former subsidiary.
The bank has two branches and made profits in 1992 of TL32bn on assets of
TL372bn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO OF the largest US banks, Chase Manhattan and NationsBank, yesterday
underscored the sector's improving earnings trend by announcing sharply
higher operating profits.
Chase Manhattan, one of the leading New York money-centre banks, reported
consolidated net income of Dollars 267m, or Dollars 1.25 a share, up 52 per
cent from Dollars 176m, or 94 cents, in the same period of last year.
NationsBank, a super-regional bank based in Charlotte, North Carolina,
reported net income of Dollars 341m, or Dollars 1.33 a share, compared with
Dollars 350m, or Dollars 1.40, in the same period of last year.
However, NationsBank said its performance was masked by one-off items and
last year's lower effective tax rate, and that pre-tax operating income
before securities gains rose 56 per cent to Dollars 507m from Dollars 324m.
Chase reported net interest revenue of Dollars 926m, up 3 per cent, with a
net interest margin of 3.99 per cent, against 4.08 per cent a year ago.
Average interest earning assets were Dollars 92.1bn, up from Dollars 87.5bn,
while average loans dropped from Dollars 64.1bn to Dollars 61.7bn.
The provision for credit losses was Dollars 215m, down Dollars 105m on a
year ago, while the return on average assets rose to 1.01 per cent from 0.71
per cent, and the return on equity was up from 11.9 per cent to 15.1 per
cent. The tier one capital ratio rose to 7.48 per cent from 6.48 per cent
For the first nine months Chase reported net income of Dollars 653m, or
Dollars 3.23 a share, against Dollars 470m, or Dollars 2.59 a share.
NationsBank reported net interest income of Dollars 1.17bn, up from Dollars
1.06n a year ago. Average loans and leases rose 15 per cent to Dollars
77.8bn.
The net interest yield was 3.83 per cent, down from 4.16 per cent, but the
bank said this rose 6 percentage points on last year's figure before the
impact of its acquisition of Chicago Research and Trading.
The return on equity was 15.6 per cent, down from 18.97 per cent, while the
tier one ratio stood at 7.60, up from 7.54. For the first nine months, net
income rose to Dollars 1.13bn, or Dollars 4.42 a share, up from Dollars
911m, or Dollars 3.69 a share.

TRIZEC, the Calgary-based property developer, has halted all payments on its
debt securities pending the outcome of debt-restructuring talks.
As a result, the company will not redeem a SFr100m (Dollars 70.1m) debenture
which falls due this Thursday.
Under proposals made in early August, Trizec plans to issue a combination of
new equity and debt securities to holders of CDollars 1.1bn (USDollars 829m)
of senior debentures and CDollars 292m of junior debt. Preferred
shareholders have also been asked to convert their holdings into common
shares.
Trizec said yesterday it aimed to release details of its final plan by
mid-November.
An Alberta court last week convened meetings of all debt and equity holders
for December 7 in Calgary to vote on the plan, which would, if approved, be
implemented the following day.
Trizec, which is North America's biggest publicly-traded property developer,
is controlled by the Bronfman family, whosestake will be substantially
diluted by the recapitalisation plan.

FT  19 OCT 93 / International Company News: Four banks in final bidding for
Gota
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THREE Swedish banks and one foreign bank have reached the final round of the
bidding for Gota Bank.
Gota, one of two large commercial banks which the state had to take over
last year at the height of Sweden's financial crisis, has some SKr60bn
(USDollars 7.62bn) of healthy assets. The government's aim is to finalise
the sale before the end of the year.
According to one estimate, Gota could fetch a price of between SKr2.5bn and
SKr3bn, given the general recovery that has taken place in the country's
banking sector this year.
Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Handelsbanken and Nordbanken have confirmed
that they are the Swedish banks in the bidding, but the identity of the
foreign bank is unclear.
The four banks have been selected from the 12 candidates which submitted
preliminary bids to acquire all or part of Gota Bank last month.
The short-listed contenders have said that they are interested in acquiring
the whole bank, excluding the SKr43bn of problem loans which were last month
split off into a separate 'bad bank' entity, called Retriva.
Analysts said that a Swedish buyer would be able to derive greater synergy
than a foreign bank from a takeover.
'It is difficult to see why a foreign financial institution would be
interested in buying a regional bank with a very high cost structure and a
client base of small- and medium-sized businesses and private individuals,'
said one observer.
However, Sweden's finance minister Mrs Anne Wibble has made plain that she
would welcome a foreign purchaser of a Swedish bank.
A victory for Nordbanken, which has also been taken over by the state, would
be controversial because the government has been criticised for capitalising
it too generously.

FT  19 OCT 93 / International Company News: Bankers Trust issues Portuguese
warrants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKERS Trust has launched two new issues of warrants on Portuguese
government bonds - the first derivatives on the country's 10-year benchmark
bonds.
Portuguese bonds surged after the government last week announced plans to
lift the withholding tax for non-resident investors.
This triggered heavy foreign buying, which pushed the 10 5/8 per cent
10-year benchmark up nearly four points to 111.70 yesterday.
The yield dropped 59 basis points to 8.99 per cent on an annual basis.
Capitalising on the increase in investor interest in Portugal, Bankers Trust
issued 2.5m straight call warrants and 1m down-and-in calls late on Friday.
The latter tranche was increased to 1.5m yesterday in response to strong
demand, said Mr Antonio Beck, a managing director at Bankers Trust.
The nine-month call warrants give holders the right to buy one 10 5/8 per
cent Portuguese government bond due 2003 at 111.00 on July 15 1994, the
warrants' expiry date.
The warrants, issued at Dollars 3.30, closed at Dollars 3.44 bid yesterday.
For those investors who feel that the rally has peaked and is poised for a
correction, Bankers Trust issued down-and-in calls priced at Dollars 2.45
each.
Under this novel structure, the holder will be paid the difference between
111 and the prevailing market price on July 15 1994 if the price of the bond
drops below 109 during the life of the warrant.
If the price stays above 109, the holder is merely refunded the full
premium.
This tranche, which was privately placed, closed at Dollars 2.59 bid
yesterday.

SHARES in Merck gained ground yesterday morning after the biggest US drugs
company posted slightly better-than-expected third-quarter profits.
During the quarter, Merck's earnings rose to Dollars 705.7m, or 62 cents a
share, compared with Dollars 634.8m, or 55 cents, a year earlier. Most
analysts had expected profits of 61 cents a share in the latest quarter.
Sales advanced 3 per cent to Dollars 2.54bn from Dollars 2.46bn.
On Wall Street, the results helped lift Merck's shares by Dollars 1 1/8 to
Dollars 32 1/4 at the close.
Merck attributed its improved earnings performance to cost control measures,
improved productivity, a better product mix and strong unit volume gains. It
said its results also benefited from restructuring and a lower tax rate.
For the first nine months, net income was Dollars 1.49bn, or Dollars 1.31. A
year earlier, the company earned Dollars 1.38bn, or Dollars 1.19. Merck's
1993 results were muddied by restructuring charges in the second quarter. In
the same period of 1992, results included charges of Dollars 462.4m for
accounting changes.
Stripping out restructuring charges in 1993 and the 1992 accounting changes,
Merck said its net income rose 10 per cent to Dollars 2.01bn, or Dollars
1.77 in the first nine months of 1993. Sales grew to Dollars 7.5bn from
Dollars 7.06bn.
The company said that sales growth was held back by the sale of its Calgon
Water Management business in the second quarter and by the impact of a
strong dollar.
In the human and animal health segment, unit sales of its high blood
pressure treatment Vasotec, anti-ulcer drugs Pepcid and Prilosec and the
anti-cholesterol drug Zocor were strong. The company's Proscar drug, to
treat symptomatic benign prostate enlargement, also contributed to the sales
gain. However, sales of cholesterol-lowering Mevacor continued to erode in
the nine months.
It is planning a Dollars 6bn takeover of Medco Containment Services, the
biggest US mail-order drugs distributor. Merck said it intended to finance
the acquisition through a combination of equity, cash and debt financing.
The transaction is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of this
year.

NWA, parent of Northwest Airlines, the fourth-largest US carrier, yesterday
reported net profits of Dollars 112.3m for the the third quarter compared
with net losses of Dollars 19.7m for the same quarter last year.
The company said the results showed that actions taken to restructure the
troubled airline over the last year had begun to take effect.
Earlier this year the heavily indebted company narrowly escaped filing for
bankruptcy by securing wage and benefit concessions from labour unions and
agreeing a restructuring of its bank loans.
The company's shares are privately held following a 1989 leveraged buy-out
led by Mr Alfred Checchi and Mr Gary Wilson, now co-chairmen.
Mr John Dasburg, president and chief executive officer, said the third
quarter was the strongest period of the year for airlines. Last year's
figure had been unusually depressed by a fares war initiated by a
competitor, so some improvement had been expected.
However, Mr Dasburg said the substantial improvement in the result
demonstrated progress in positioning Northwest for long-term profitability.
'We still have much work ahead of us, but we are pleased with our results in
the third quarter and grateful to the people of Northwest for their diligent
efforts to restore Northwest to profitability,' he said.
Traffic for the quarter decreased 9.1 per cent to 15.94bn passenger miles
from 17.54bn the previous year, but profits improved because loss-making
domestic routes were cut and costs came down.
Turnover rose by 5.9 per cent to Dollars 2.393bn and operating profits rose
to Dollars 270.1m from Dollars 61m.

CAPITAL Cities/ABC, the US broadcasting group, yesterday announced a 27 per
cent increase in earnings for the third quarter.
The ABC television network, which returned to profit after posting an
operating loss in the 1992 third quarter, was largely responsible for the
improvement.
Wall Street reacted enthusiastically to the news. At the close, the share
price was up Dollars 11 at Dollars 626.
The results follow the announcement by CBS last week that its third-quarter
earnings were nearly three times greater than its income a year ago.
For Capital Cities/ABC, consolidated net income was Dollars 78.2m, or
Dollars 4.75 a share, against Dollars 62.1m, or Dollars 3.74, in the
corresponding quarter of 1992.
The results reflect a provision for a federal tax increase enacted earlier
this year.
Net revenues climbed to Dollars 1.3bn, a gain of 7 per cent on last year.
Revenues from broadcasting operations were up 11 per cent, with the ABC
network benefitting from improved advertising rates and the absence of last
year's broadcast of the summer Olympics on a rival network.
Revenue from the group's video operations continued to climb, largely due to
the growth of ESPN, the cable station featuring 24-hour sports programming.
Turnover from radio was moderately up, while publishing, excluding the
effect of acquisitions, disposals and start-up, showed a 3 per cent sales
increase.
For the first nine months, consolidated net income before extraordinary
charges was Dollars 300.6m, compared with Dollars 251.4m, before the
cumulative effect of accounting changes, in the 1992 period.

AMERICAN Home Products, the US pharmaceutical company, yesterday posted a 4
per cent gain in third-quarter net income to Dollars 397.6m from Dollars
382.4m on sales up 3 per cent to Dollars 2.17bn from Dollars 2.11bn.
Earnings per share advanced 5 per cent to Dollars 1.28 from Dollars 1.22 in
the same period of 1992.
Pharmaceuticals, which account for most of the group's turnover, saw sales
slide 1 per cent to Dollars 1.19bn in the quarter.
US pharmaceutical sales advanced only 2 per cent in the latest quarter.
Sales of anti-inflammatory products grew following the introduction of
Lodine 400, and helped to offset decreased sales of the group's infant
nutritional products.
International pharmaceutical sales fell 5 per cent in the quarter,
reflecting unfavourable foreign exchange rates and weaker economies in some
of the company's key foreign markets.
Sales of consumer health care products rose 6 per cent to Dollars 493.4m in
the quarter, led by strong growth overseas, while those of medical supplies
and diagnostic products also grew 6 per cent to Dollars 216m.
For the first nine months, net income stood at Dollars 1.09bn, or Dollars
3.50 on sales of Dollars 6.19bn. A year earlier, the company reported net
income of Dollars 1.1bn, or Dollars 3.49, including charges for accounting
changes and for acquired research.
Stripping out these charges from last year's results, net income rose 8 per
cent in the first nine months of this year.

<TEXT>
MR JOHN Sculley, who resigned last week as chairman of Apple Computer, has
joined Spectrum Information Technologies, a small New York company that has
developed technology for the transmission of data on cellular telephone
networks.
For Mr Sculley, who earlier this year made a bid for the top job at
International Business Machines and has been mentioned as a potential
candidate to head Kodak, the move seems extraordinary.
However, over the past year he has frequently mentioned his wish to form a
high technology start-up company.
Spectrum's computer-to-cellular linking technology is also central to Mr
Sculley's interests in developing hand-held computer devices such as Apple's
Newton.
Mr Sculley will become chairman and chief executive of Spectrum. He was
recruited by Mr Peter Caserta, the present chief executive, who will remain
at the company as vice chairman and president.
'I am tremendously impressed with Peter Caserta and his vision and
leadership in building Spectrum as a foundation for expansive growth,' said
Mr Sculley.
Spectrum Information Technologies claims to have developed the first
commercially successful cellular modem, a device that will link portable
computers to cellular telephone networks.
In September the company announced that it had been awarded a patent on
technology that simplifies computer-to-cellular connections.
Spectrum has licensed its patented technology to several companies,
including AT&amp;T and Rockwell International. These licensing agreements 'are
indicative of the company's potential,' Mr Sculley said.
Spectrum, formed in 1984, has reported losses for the past five years. For
fiscal 1993, ending in March, it reported net losses of Dollars 9.9m on
revenues of Dollars 98.7m.

AVON Products, the US cosmetics, toiletries and jewellery group, is
confident that its fourth-quarter and full-year consolidated income and
sales from continuing operations will increase, Reuter reports from New
York.
In spite of softness in some of its largest markets, mainly because of
sluggish economic conditions, the group said its third-quarter results,
announced yesterday, were a little better than anticipated.
In the third quarter, Avon reported net income of Dollars 54m on a 2 per
cent increase in sales to Dollars 957.1m. However, earnings per share were
unchanged at 75 cents, on an increased number of shares. In the same period
last year, Avon posted net income of Dollars 53.9m on revenues of Dollars
938.8m.
Third-quarter earnings included a pre-tax gain of Dollars 8m, or 9 cents a
share, on the sale of an asset.
Avon said that this year's earnings were also helped by lower annual
effective tax rate.
It added that in spite of weakness in the US, it was confident that both
fourth-quarter and full-year consolidated sales and income from continuing
operations would show an improvement.
Beckman Instruments, the US laboratory systems group, is restructuring and
will reduce its worldwide workforce by more than 750 jobs, or about 11 per
cent, AP-DJ reports.
It will take a significant charge which will be specified in the fourth
quarter of 1993.

FT  19 OCT 93 / International Company News: Taking Groupe Bull by the horns
/ Profile of Jean-Marie Descarpentries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JEAN-MARIE Descarpentries' message to his staff after his appointment
yesterday as chairman of Groupe Bull was succinct and brutal: 'There is not
a minute to lose and not a franc to waste.'
The combination of Mr Descarpentries' appointment and - subject to European
Commission approval - a cash injection of FFr7bn (Dollars 1.23bn) is the
last throw of the dice for the state-owned computer manufacturer. Bull's
position is serious. It is overmanned, its manufacturing costs are too high,
its products lack innovation, and its balance sheet has been shaken by
FFr15bn of losses in the past three years.
Mr Descarpentries knows all this. He was a member of Bull's board between
1986 and 1992, a critical period when customers began to favour computer
networks over mainframes and traditional computer companies began to report
losses.
But is Mr Descarpentries, 57, the man to administer the medicine Bull needs
to effect a recovery? Flamboyant, charismatic and didactic, he cuts a
different figure from the cool, analytical Mr Francis Lorentz, Bull chairman
until 1992 and the man who devised the basis of the company's recovery
strategy. He is also distinct from his immediate predecessor, the affable
but determined Mr Bernard Pache.
Mr Descarpentries has a fondness for management philosophies that seem to go
down better in the Gallic than the Anglo-Saxon business world. He divides
managers into chevaliers (warriors with swords), and Benedictines (withdrawn
sceptics). In one of his best known initiatives, 29 senior executives from
the packaging company CarnaudMetalbox, whose formation he had overseen, were
taken, clad in green jogging suits, into the Jordanian desert for a
brainstorming and bonding session.
Such bizarre events detract from the evident respect colleagues have for his
business sense. Mr Pierre Bonelli, chief executive of the Anglo-French
computing services company, Sema Group, and a close friend of Mr
Descarpentries, believes he will be good for Bull. 'He is a good leader. His
chief strength is in operations and that is what Bull needs most at
present,' he said.
'Being owned by the government does not make it any easier for Bull to solve
its problems. I think the appointment of Jean-Marie is a clear signal that
this is going to change. I think he will have more freedom than any Bull
manager has had in the past. I hope so - for Bull and for him]'
Others, while paying tribute to Mr Descarpentries' strength of purpose, warn
of apparent character flaws. One British manager who has worked closely with
him said: 'He can touch the high spots, but he can fall from grace. He is
not all that sensitive in personal relationships and often does not get the
best out of people.
'There are contradictions in his personality. One of his strengths is his
ability to to manage cost. He has a clear view of what must be done and if
he has to get rid of people then he gets rid of people'.
A graduate of the prestigious Ecole Polytechnique, he began his career at
Shell, where he held various engineering and technical posts before becoming
commercial director of the petrochemical division.
Between 1969 and 1976, he worked at McKinsey, the management consultancy. He
is best known, however, for his work at Carnaud, the French packaging group,
where he was managing director between 1981 and 1991. There he oversaw the
merger in 1991 with Metal Box of the UK to create CarnaudMetalbox, one of
the world's largest packaging groups.
Although the merger was hailed at the time as a model of international
co-operation, it quickly encountered problems. Profits fell sharply, and the
following year he was quickly replaced by Mr Jugen Hintz, the current
chairman.
Observers say he has already declined the Bull chairmanship once - at the
time of Mr Pache's appointment in 1992.
Mr Descarpentries new role reflects the French government's impatience with
Mr Pache's efforts to restore Bull to profitability. Since taking office
with the centre-right government in March, Mr Gerard Longuet, the French
industry minister, has repeatedly demanded strong measures to stem the
company's losses.
The fact that Mr Descarpentries comes from the private sector is also
significant. Heads of French public sector companies are usually drawn from
the ranks of senior bureaucrats. 'Since its nationalisation in 1982, Bull
has been too dependent on the state,' said Mr Longuet.
He described Bull's new chairman as 'a man of industry', citing his record
of a tenfold increase in sales during his tenure at CarnaudMetalbox. Bull
should now take its management decisions only on the basis of the market,
said Mr Longuet.

FT  19 OCT 93 / International Company News: BNP shares open at 18% premium
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), the French government's first
privatisation candidate, yesterday closed at FFr283.90, an 18 per cent
premium over the original FFr240 offer price, at the end of the first day of
official trading on the Paris stock market.
BNP's shares opened at FFr277.20, immediately breaching the 15 per cent
trading limit for the first day of dealings. The shares were suspended for
15 minutes, only to resume trading at FFr282.50. They then rose to a high of
FFr285.90 before settling down to the closing price.
The enthusiastic response to the BNP issue caused chaos on the Paris market
as brokers were swamped with orders for shares.
Dealers estimated that some 2.25m BNP shares changed hands in the first two
hours of trading and that around 4m shares were traded in the course of the
day, representing 3.4 per cent of the bank's equity.
'It's been crazy, just crazy,' said one Paris banking analyst. 'It's almost
like London used to be during the Thatcherite privatisations back in the
1980s.'
The BNP issue, which was priced far lower than analysts had expected, was
heavily oversubscribed by both institutional and individual investors.
The French government was forced to reduce dramatically the allocation of
equity to institutions, to try to satisfy demand from the public. However,
it still rationed the number of shares given to individual investors.
Banking analysts attributed the strong demand for BNP shares to heavy buying
from institutions that had been disappointed by their allocations in the
original issue.
Some individual investors seized their chance to make quick profits by
selling their shares.
'The offer price was so low that subscribing for BNP shares almost looked
like a licence to make money,' commented another analyst. 'But the French
government wanted to make sure that the first privatisation was a success -
and it's done it.'

FT  19 OCT 93 / International Company News: Brokerage business helps
Primerica advance 57%
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRIMERICA, the financial services group which last month announced an agreed
bid for the US insurer Travelers, yesterday reported a 57 per cent
improvement in third-quarter profits, to Dollars 258.7m.
The strong performance was fuelled by another record quarter from
Primerica's Wall Street brokerage subsidiary, Smith Barney Shearson.
The group's overall results, however, were affected by a string of special
factors.
They included Dollars 89.6m in gains from portfolio investments and sales of
subsidiaries and affiliates; a Dollars 65m provision for the cost of the
merger between Smith Barney and Shearson; and an Dollars 8.1m charge related
to a recently-enacted tax increase. Once these factors are stripped out,
Primerica's third-quarter operating earnings came in at Dollars 242.2m, up
77 per cent from a year ago.
Smith Barney Shearson again proved to be the star of Primerica's show. The
firm, the second-largest brokerage house in the US after Merrill Lynch,
earned Dollars 118.8m in the quarter, which includes two months' results
from Shearson following its acquisition on July 31.
Like other Wall Street firms, Smith Barney Shearson continues to benefit
from heavy interest in the stock and bond markets among individual
investors, strong demand for asset management services, and record-breaking
underwriting activity on the US capital markets.
Mr Weill described Primerica's third quarter as 'gratifying and exciting'.
He said the steady improvement in Travelers' operating performance meant
that once the insurance company was merged into Primerica, the combined
group should have a prosperous future.
Travelers' results, also announced yesterday, were not as sparkling as
Primerica's. It reported a net loss of Dollars 36m in the quarter, blaming a
Dollars 211m charge following a Dollars 325m addition to its reserves to
cover asbestos and environmental claims.
Excluding the charge and a Dollars 40m one-off tax benefit, Travelers earned
Dollars 135m in the third quarter, compared with the Dollars 358m loss it
incurred at the same stage of 1992. That loss was due mostly to costs
associated with Hurricane Andrew and corporate restructuring initiatives.
Travelers' said underlying profit performance continued to improve, thanks
partly to cost-cutting.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PUBLICIS, one of France's leading marketing services groups, is expanding
its interests by merging with FCA], one of the few remaining independent
French advertising agencies, in a share swap deal.
The merger, which will leave Publicis with a majority interest in the
combined company, follows months of negotiations in which FCA] has tried to
find an international partner.
FCA], the fourth largest advertising agency in France, which also has an
international network, fell into the red last year following a fraud
perpetrated by an executive who is now in prison. It held talks with
McCann-Erickson, one of the largest agencies within Interpublic, the US
marketing group, but eventually decided to merge with Publicis.
Mr Maurice Levy, chairman of Publicis, said that the merger 'will reinforce
our position in almost every country and will enable us for the first time
to have a strong agency in New York'.

recent allegations of fraud from the authorities and minority shareholders
in Belgium had been 'intentionally' timed to disrupt the French engineering
and construction group's forthcoming FFr3bn (Dollars 531m) rights issue.
The issue, whose details have yet to be announced, would allow Schneider to
reduce its debt-to-equity ratio to below 1:1, from 1.7:1 last year, the
group president said. He also confirmed that Schneider was still ready to
give Daimler-Benz, the owner of AEG, a stake in its capital. However, recent
discussions 'had run up against the fact that we have considerable
difficulty in finding a formula which would protect our mutual interests'.
Earlier this month, the Belgian justice authorities announced the opening of
a fraud investigation against Mr Pineau-Valencienne. In an interview with
Les Echos, the French business daily, he responded to claims that the
investigation covered allegations of money-laundering by a company called PB
Finance, in which Cofibel, a Schneider subsidiary, has a stake.
'To the best of our knowledge, there is not the slightest mechanism in the
structure of PB Finance, as in our industrial activities in Belgium, which
would allow any laundering of any kind,' he told Les Echos. 'I would add
that money was rather burnt than laundered, because PB Finance lost a lot of
cash.'
Mr Pineau-Valencienne said although he was president of Cofibel, it was the
company's late Belgian administrator who had persuaded him to take a
minority stake in PB Finance, controlled by Mr Valentino Foti, an Italian
businessman.
Belgian minority shareholders of Cofibel and another Schneider subsidiary,
Cofimines, had complained about Schneider's bid to buy them out. Schneider,
however, was offering 50 per cent above the market price, Mr
Pineau-Valencienne said.

FT  19 OCT 93 / International Company News: Lundbergs lifts MoDo voting
stake to near 50%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LUNDBERGS, a Swedish construction and real estate group, has taken effective
control of MoDo, the country's third-largest forestry group. It exchanged
shares worth SKr1.1bn (Dollars 137.5m) with one of MoDo's main domestic
rivals, Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget (SCA).
The agreement increases Lundbergs' voting stake in MoDo to 49 per cent from
26 per cent, and reduces SCA's voting influence from 27 per cent to just 3.5
per cent.
This will reduce the ownership tensions within MoDo created when SCA
acquired its stake, in December 1990m, for SKr1.4bn.
'The clarification of the ownership picture is positive for MoDo, not least
internally,' said Mr Bernt Lof, MoDo chief executive.
SCA abandoned its hopes of co-operation with MoDo last year, claiming
differences of opinion over strategy. It has effectively been seeking a
buyer for its holding since.
It believes that by swapping 3.9m A shares, with 10 votes each, for 5.1m
one-vote B shares it has gained a more liquid stake, which will be easier to
sell once the forestry industry recovers.
Even though it gained a 30 per cent premium for its stake, it acknowledged
yesterday that MoDo's shares needed to rise 40 per cent before it recouped
the SKr1.59bn it has invested, both initially and through subscribing to
MoDo's current rights issue. The current market value of its stake is
SKr1.14bn.
SCA said future investments in Sweden would be centred on value-added
products, such as lightweight coated paper. In Europe, meanwhile, it aimed
to build up newsprint operations, based on recycled paper, close to big
population centres.
The company still has an 11.7 per cent equity stake in MoDo, and retains the
right to appoint a board representative through an agreement with Lundbergs.

FT  19 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Christian Salvesen pays Pounds 84m for
distributor - Purchase of Swift will not dilute group earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRISTIAN SALVESEN, the distribution, specialist hire and manufacturing
group, has agreed to pay Pounds 83.9m for Swift Distribution Holdings, a
delivery company for the automotive and engineering industries.
Swift was the subject of a Pounds 26m management buy-out in February last
year from Lep Group, the security and freight forwarding concern.
Swift's managers, backed by Prudential Venture Managers and 3i, paid Pounds
8m in cash, assumed Pounds 11m of debt and raised a further Pounds 7m in
working capital.
Mr Chris Masters, chief executive of Salvesen, said he was happy with the
amount paid, in spite of the sharp increase in the group's price since the
buy-out, and to have acquired Swift's management and workforce. The
acquisition would not dilute group earnings.
He said the deal meant Salvesen was now firmly established as a one of the
leading companies in the third-party industrial distribution sector, which
had considerable growth potential both in the UK and overseas.
Salvesen is one of a small group of companies that provide dedicated
distribution operations for retailers such as Marks and Spencer, J.
Sainsbury and Safeway. However, it accepts that the UK retail market is
relatively mature and has been keen to apply its logistics expertise to
other areas, such as industrial components.
Mr Masters said Salvesen had particular experience of managing warehouses,
while Swift had greater knowledge of running a network of multi-user depots,
so there would be a close and useful fit. Industrial distribution was
becoming increasingly international, so Swift would also benefit from
Salvesen's overseas exposure.
Northampton-based Swift operates from 22 depots, linked by electronic data
systems. The company has a fleet of more than 700 vehicles and employs some
1,500 people throughout the UK.
It made operating profits of Pounds 6.5m in 1992. Net assets acquired amount
to Pounds 20m.
As a result of the purchase, Salvesen's gearing will increase to about 50
per cent, compared with 14.5 per cent at its March year-end.

FT  19 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Two engineering consultancies join to
embrace water, transport and power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOTT MACDONALD, one of the UK's largest engineering consultancies, is
negotiating to acquire Ewbank Preece, the Brighton-based company that is the
leading UK consultancy in the international power market.
The deal would create the UK's biggest multi-disciplinary engineering
consultancy and one of the largest in the world, with nearly 5,000 employees
and annual turnover nearing Pounds 200m.
Both are private companies and terms of the proposed acquisition are
undisclosed. It is hoped to complete the deal by the end of the year.
Mott, based in Croydon, was formed in 1989 through the merger of Mott, Hay &amp;
Anderson, transportation experts, with MacDonald, water industry
specialists.
Mr Jeffrey Turnbull, chairman of Mott, said yesterday the company had a
long-term strategy to cover water, transportation and power - the third main
sector for consultancy work, where its current presence is small.
A broader spread of industries is important for large consultancies, as it
increases their ability to offset downturns in one sector with better
conditions elsewhere.
A merger would also give Mott a presence in the fast-growing Asian market
for power projects, where Ewbank Preece has been active.
The deal would involve Mott buying the engineering consultancy from a new
holding company, County Union, which will retain Ewbank Preece's property
and hotel interests.
Mr Turnbull said there was little overlap between the two engineering
consultancies, apart from in central service functions.
Mott is much the larger of the two companies, with 3,500 staff in more than
50 offices worldwide and expected turnover this year of Pounds 150m.
Ewbank Preece has more than 1,400 staff in 40 offices worldwide, and had
turnover of Pounds 37m in the year ended March.
Both companies have pre-tax profits margins of about 7 per cent.
Mr George Cummings, chairman and chief executive of Ewbank Preece, said that
together the two companies would form a powerful group, well placed to lead
its chosen markets.
Mott's recent large projects include Hong Kong's new airport terminal and
Lantau Fixed Crossing, and CrossRail and the Jubilee Line extension in the
UK.

FT  19 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Interest hits Waste Management - Pace of
acquisitions poised to continue in fourth quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WASTE MANAGEMENT International, the UK-listed arm of WMX Technologies of the
US, reported a 3 per cent decline, from Pounds 40.1m to Pounds 38.9m, in
third-quarter pre-tax profits.
Turnover in the three months to September 30 increased to Pounds 235.1m
(Pounds 210.9m) and operating profits jumped 21 per cent to Pounds 42.8m
(Pounds 35.4m).
The gain in operating profits, however, was more than offset by
substantially higher net interest costs of Pounds 8.47m (Pounds 827,000) and
lower other income - including foreign exchange earnings and dividend income
from the 15per cent stake in Wessex Water - of Pounds 4.53m (Pounds 5.51m).
After a reduced tax charge of Pounds 10.7m (Pounds 13.4m) and minority
interests of Pounds 2.54m (Pounds 3.88m) the group recorded retained profits
of Pounds 25.6m (Pounds 22.8m) and earnings per share of 6.8p (6.1p).
Mr Edwin Falkman, chief executive, said the earnings increase had been
achieved despite difficult trading conditions in Europe and fewer
acquisitions than had been anticipated.
He added that the results were also adversely affected by delays in
obtaining landfill permit extensions in Italy, which caused lower volumes.
However, he added: 'We anticipate that volumes to these landfills will
increase later this year.'
Mr Falkman also said that Waste Management had made 'significant progress in
several markets in Asia', including Hong Kong and Indonesia.
So far this year the group has completed 34 acquisitions in 10 countries
and, following a lull over the summer, expects this pace of activity to
continue in the fourth quarter.
The results lift nine-month pre-tax profits to Pounds 110.3m (Pounds 102.7m)
on turnover ahead 17 per cent to Pounds 690.9m (Pounds 592.8m). Earnings per
share were also up by 17 per cent, to 19.6p (16.8p).
The group was floated on the Stock Exchange through a listing of 20 per cent
of its shares in April last year by Waste Management, since renamed WMX
Technologies. As indicated at the time of the flotation, the company is not
paying a dividend for the first three years.

FT  19 OCT 93 / UK Company News: MY shares jump on advance to Pounds 2.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MY HOLDINGS lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.28m to Pounds 2.51m for the
year to August 28, in spite of pressure on some prices.
Shares in the USM-quoted packaging company moved ahead 7 1/2 p to 52 1/2 p.
'It was a difficult year and the results were better than I expected,' Mr
John Monks, chief executive, said. 'I don't see the outlook as being any
better,' he added.
A recommended final dividend of 1p lifts the total for the year to 1.25p
(1p). Earnings per share fell to 3.91p (3.95p) because new accounting rules
forced the restatement of a Pounds 220,000 tax credit in the comparative
figures.
Sales on continuing operations declined to Pounds 33.6m (Pounds 34.3m).
Total turnover reached Pounds 35.1m, however, with the acquisition in
February of Kohler, the printed folding cartons maker, making up the
difference.
The Pounds 1.3m purchase from Malbak, the company's South African parent,
contributed Pounds 180,000 to operating profits of Pounds 2.67m (Pounds
2.42m).
'Volume has grown in some areas but price most definitely hasn't. We have
seen some price slippage,' said Mr Monks.
The cushion packaging business contributed a fifth of sales, against nearer
a quarter last year, as buyers struggling with the decline in demand for
electrical and household goods in the UK were faced with the same difficulty
in mainland Europe.
The thermoforming business performed well in the first half but saw less
seasonal buoyancy as poor summer weather squashed demand for containers used
to pack soft fruit.
Capital expenditure was more than Pounds 3.5m (Pounds 3m). The group spent
Pounds 2m on a second polypropylene extrusion and thermoforming line that
produces trays for microwaveable and short shelf-life products.
Bank borrowings at the year end were Pounds 283,000 (Pounds 723,000).
Gearing fell to 2 per cent (5 per cent).

FT  19 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Ewart falls into the red and passes
dividend
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EXCEPTIONAL provision together with higher interest costs left Ewart, the
Northern Ireland-based property developer, with pre-tax losses of Pounds
155,721 for the year to end-April.
The exceptional item amounted to Pounds 279,377 and represented the cost of
an extraordinary meeting. Interest charges took some Pounds 200,000 more at
Pounds 949,493.
Earnings per share fell to 0.44p (1.18p) and, like the interim, the final is
also passed - last year a total of 0.75p was paid.
Directors said the investment market was strengthening with demand
outstripping supply of well covenanted properties in prime loc-ations.
They considered the timing of the company's entry into the investment market
in the UK to have been right and said properties acquired were performing
well.

FT  19 OCT 93 / UK Company News: United Friendly buys American Express arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED FRIENDLY, the life assurance company, is acquiring Acuma, the UK
personal financial consulting and life insurance subsidiary of American
Express, for about Pounds 13.6m.
As a result of the takeover, up to 300 job losses are expected at Acuma's
head office.
About 730 people currently work there and some of the job losses will be
through a compulsory redundancy programme.
United Friendly is buying Acuma Fin-ancial Products Limited and Acuma
Limited.
The book value of the assets to be acquired was Pounds 6.3m at the end of
December 1992. At the same date AFP had shareholder assets of Pounds 4.1m
and the value of the long-term fund of Acuma Life Assurance Limited was
Pounds 75.9m.
United Friendly intends to expand Acuma's business beyond its base in
south-east England to areas such as Scotland, Wales and the north of
England.
It expects to double the Acuma sales force to about 600 or so within the
next five years.
The acquisition, which is subject to regulatory approval, will also give
United Friendly access to better-off households, where Acuma already has
about 20,000 clients.
Acuma's sales force will continue to operate separately.
United Friendly's main business at present is in life assurance and general
insurance to middle and lower income households.
In the year to December 31 1992, AFP had a gross premium income of Pounds
42m and suffered pre-tax losses of Pounds 400,000.
After a short transitional period, to allow for the costs of establishing
the business, Acuma is expected to generate profits on an embedded value
basis - intended to recognise in the accounts the value of the future
profits stream.
But the current accounting basis used by United Friendly will give rise to
small losses for several years after the acquisition, the directors
explained.

FT  19 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Farnell makes Dollars 70m purchase - Growth
in all main trading subsidiaries behind advance to Pounds 21m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FARNELL Electronics, the electronics components manufacturer and
distributor, is paying Dollars 69.8m (Pounds 46.2m) cash to acquire
Multicomponents from ITT, the US conglomerate.
The proposed acquisition, which will make Farnell the second largest
distributor by turnover in Europe after Arrow Electronics and place it among
the top six in the world, came as the group announced a 37 per cent increase
in interim pre-tax profits, excluding exceptionals, to Pounds 21.1m.
The acquisition is seen as a natural fit and will be financed from bank
facilities and Farnell's cash resources. The market welcomed the move,
together with Farnell's better than expected first-half results, and the
company's shares closed 26p higher at 486p.
Analysts believe Farnell's management will move quickly to squeeze costs out
of Multicomponents and boost its operating margins significantly.
Farnell acquired the ESD electronics components distribution business from
STC for Pounds 61m in 1991 and has since succeeded in boosting its sales and
margins considerably despite the recession.
Multicomponents, which has 20 sales offices in 12 European countries as well
as 7 in Canada and the US, is one of the leading broadline volume
distributors of electronic components in Europe. Its turnover in 1992 was
Pounds 154m (Pounds 139m).
However, the ITT unit has been undergoing a restructuring, and operating
profits before exceptional items and restructuring costs were Pounds 2.2m
last year compared with Pounds 800,000 in 1991.
Mr Richard Hanwell, chairman, said the acquisition was first mooted by
Farnell a year ago. He said it had been under negotiation since April and
was completed early yesterday by Mr Howard Poulson, Farnell's new chief
executive, and Mr Henry Elstone, finance director.
He said the acquisition was in line with the group's strategy of expanding
its two distribution models, FEC, which distributes about 30,000 components
through a catalogue, and ESD, into new geographical markets.
Mr Hanwell said the deal would give Farnell 'critical mass' in the European
electronics components distribution business and enable it to negotiate more
effectively with its suppliers.
Farnell's results for the six months to July 31 reflected a strong
performance by all its main trading subsidiaries. Sales rose by 16 per cent
to Pounds 147m (Pounds 126.8m), fuelled by recovery in the UK and continuing
expansion in new markets.
Operating profit grew by 33 per cent to Pounds 21.3m (Pounds 16m) as margins
improved to 14.5 per cent (12.6 per cent) reflecting operating efficiencies,
particularly in the manufacturing division and ESD.
Strong cash generation helped reduce interest charges and restored the group
to a Pounds 6.77m net cash position.
The pre-tax line was only slightly below the Pounds 21.8m reported last
year, struck after the inclusion of a Pounds 6.4m one-off gain from the
disposal of a non-trading subsidiary.
Earnings, adjusted to exclude the exceptional, increased to 10.5p (7.5p) and
the interim dividend is lifted to 3.2p (2.7p).

FT  19 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Mt Charlotte benefits from occupancy rate
rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL and MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WELLINGTON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN IMPROVEMENT in occupancy rates in the UK hotel industry is benefiting
Mount Charlotte and could hasten its reflotation.
This was revealed yesterday by Mr Bob Matthew, chairman of Brierley
Investments of New Zealand, which owns 70 per cent of Mount Charlotte.
He was speaking after the publication of the group's annual report.
However, a float was not expected until 1995. Mr Robert Peel, Mount
Charlotte's chief executive who remained in charge when BIL took the group
over in 1990, said his preferred route was a flotation.
He said there had been 'a material improvement in London occupancy in the
last 12 weeks'. BIL said the rate had risen 11 percentage points over a year
ago. Mr Peel said volumes in the provincial hotels were also up this year.
The chain includes 102 hotels plus another 12 managed for other owners,
totalling about 14,500 rooms. Of these, 24 hotels and 6,585 rooms were in
London making it the largest chain in the capital.
Mr Peel said that in the 1980s London occupancy rates were generally over 80
per cent but had fallen to the low 60s. Now they were in the mid-to-high 70s
again. Bookings for next year suggested a considerable improvement for the
first half. However, room rates were still under pressure, he said.
Operational gearing in the business meant that a return to earlier occupancy
rates could add Pounds 30m to pre-tax profits, he said. Mount Charlotte made
a profit of Pounds 2.1m after tax in 1992, up from Pounds 1.5m in 1991.
Mr Peel added that the market for hotels, which had been difficult and
overhung by the number of hotels in the hands of receivers and by the
troubles at Queens Moat Houses, was beginning to get easier.
Queens Moat Houses, which is negotiating a refinancing, said yesterday that
the upturn in UK occupancy levels it had noted at the annual meeting in
August was continuing.
Aside from a flotation of Mount Charlotte, other options include disposals
of individual hotels, packages of hotels or a stake in the group. In 1991
BIL sold a 30 per cent holding to two Singaporean government agencies.
Mr Rodney Price, who is to assume direct responsibility for BIL's UK assets
when Mr Trevor Beyer retires next March, said a move could not have been
contemplated until there was some pick up in the market. Now, he said,
'things are on the move, it is all positive for the industry, but the timing
is still not right'.
Mr Matthew said BIL had received a wide range of approaches. The time seemed
to be approaching when more appropriate prices could be achieved, he added.

FT  19 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Panel clears Owners Abroad over Airtours
bid irregularity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TAKEOVER Panel yesterday comprehensively cleared Owners Abroad, the tour
operator, of any suggestion that it misled holders when it fought off a
takeover bid by rival Airtours earlier this year.
The panel said it launched an inquiry when Owners warned last July that
full-year profits were likely to be half market expectations. Owners said
the deterioration was the result of changes in customer preference, severe
price competition and competitors using their own travel agencies to sell
holidays.
Following the profits warning, Mr Howard Klein, chairman, and Mr Roger
Allard, managing director, announced their resignations.
During the takeover Owners did not make any profits forecast. It did base
its defence, however, on its underlying strengths - including a proposed
link-up with Thomas Cook and its trading performance.
The panel said it was 'satisfied that the statements relating to current
trading and prospects in the defence documentation were prepared with the
required standards of care and accuracy and that the information given by
Owners and its advisers in that connection was adequately and fairly
presented'.
'The reasons for the profits warning given by Owners in its interim
announcement were factors which either were not apparent or not material
during the period of Airtours' offer or had not yet arisen and were not
reasonably foreseeable.'

FT  19 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Tottenham warning clips share price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOTTENHAM Hotspur's shares closed 6p lower at 109p yesterday after the north
London football club issued a profits warning following the cost of
unexpected repairs to its East Stand.
As a result of year-end provisions totalling about Pounds 1.4m the group
said pre-tax profits for the year to May 31 would be about Pounds 3.3m,
somewhat lower than earlier estimates.
Twice during the bitter summer battle for control of the club between Mr
Alan Sugar and Mr Terry Venables, Tottenham was forced to make a statement
to the Stock Exchange following unauthorised public statements by Mr
Venables about company profits.
In the second statement, issued on July 27, Tottenham said that pre-tax
profits for the 10 months to March 31 were approximately Pounds 4m.
Yesterday, the company confirmed that subsequent trading had continued to be
profitable but added that its full-year profits 'will be subject to certain
year-end provisions for items such as legal expenses and the costs of
unexpected major repairs to the East Stand'.
Tottenham's results are due to be announced by November 5.
Mr Colin Sandy, finance director, said yesterday that the repairs to the
stand involved replacing wooden floorboards that had been treated with a
fire-retardant chemical during refurbishment in 1988-89. Subsequently they
developed wet and dry rot and have had to be replaced with steel.

SEAFIELD is disposing of its property interests and re-investing proceeds in
its transport, warehousing and distribution businesses.
The Dublin-based group has agreed to sell its Charterhall Properties
subsidiary to Able Corporation for up to IPounds 7m (Pounds 6.7m).
On turnover ahead from IPounds 11.4m to IPounds 16.9m the company also

Losses per share fell from 2.2p to 1.6p.
Directors said that the disposal will remove Pounds 14.8m of Charterhall's

They pointed out that Charterhall's principal property bankers were now only
lending on a day-to-day basis: 'We now have the opportunity to see these
banks repaid, to release cash from the property interests . . . and stop
further erosion of value from ongoing losses.'

FT  19 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Further initiatives at Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO NEW initiatives designed to take advantage of the move by the Lloyd's
insurance market to seek corporate investors were announced yesterday.
Johnson Fry, the financial services group, opened an offer for subscription
for its Corporate Insurance Recovery Trust, which will invest in the shares
of other Lloyd's investment companies. It aims to raise between Pounds 15m
and Pounds 50m. The latest date for applications is November 2, with
dealings beginning on November 8. Minimum subscription is Pounds 3,000.
Hill Samuel, the merchant bank, is joining forces with Panmure Gordon, the
stockbroker, and RF Kershaw, the members' agent, to raise Pounds 50m for the
Delian Lloyd's Investment Trust. The portfolio will be managed by Foreign &amp;
Colonial Management.
The two deals are the latest in a string of initiatives. Late last week
Rafael Zorn Hemsley, the stockbroker, announced its intention to raise
Pounds 30m through Syndicate Capital Trust. John Govett will manage the
funds, while a new company, Insurance Analysis, will advise the trust on
participations in 17 syndicates.
Peel Hunt, the stockbroker is sponsoring Corporate Membership, a company
formed by two Names, Mr Donald Green and Mr Anthony Hamilton, which aims to
raise between Pounds 8m and Pounds 20m in capital.
Separately, the Hiscox Select Insurance Fund, backed by Roberts &amp; Hiscox,
the members' agency, and Charterhouse Tilney, the securities house, last
week issued its pathfinder prospectus.
Hiscox aims to raise Pounds 28.9m from a placing and will provide Pounds 50m
of capacity to approximately 70 syndicates.
Decisions to go ahead with all the schemes are dependent on a vote in favour
of the corporate capital initiative at tomorrow's extraordinary meeting of
Lloyd's.

FT  19 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Anagen reduces interim deficit to Pounds
1.78m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Anagen, the biotechnology company, reduced pre-tax losses from Pounds 2.39m
to Pounds 1.78m in the six months ended June 30, just two weeks after the
company came to market.
Turnover of Pounds 1.27m (Pounds 218,000) was derived, the company said,
mainly from payments by Organon Teknika following the signing of a worldwide
marketing agreement for the AN2000 immunoassay system.
Operating losses of Pounds 1.3m reflected continuing development activities,
the company said.
Interest payments of Pounds 436,000 (Pounds 268,000) were made on short-term
debts, since eliminated following the Pounds 14.3m flotation proceeds.
Losses per share were cut to 5.6p (9p).

FT  19 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Rentokil's majority holder reduces stake to
52.4%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RENTOKIL, the environmental and property services company, said a total of
40m of its shares had yesterday been placed with institutions.
The shares closed 2p down on the day at 209p.
Its majority shareholder, Sophus Berendsen, sold 29m shares, reducing its
holding from 55.4 per cent to 52.4 per cent, or 510.6m shares. The Danish
conglomerate said it would use the proceeds of approximately DKr580m (Pounds
53m) to reduce short-term liabilities and strengthen its debt to equity
ratio.
Separately, the KG Anker-Petersen Will Trust sold 11m shares, reducing its
holding from 4.2 per cent to 3 per cent, or 29.6m shares.
Rentokil said arrangements had been made for both sales to be co-ordinated.
Sophus Berendsen has maintained a majority stake in Rentokil since it went
public in 1969. It said yesterday's sale did not mark a change of strategy
and gave a firm undertaking not to sell any further shares for at least 12
months.
Rentokil accounts for about 60 per cent of Sophus Berendsen's sales - up 8.5
per cent at DKr4.2bn at its half year. Rentokil's interim pre-tax profits
were up 30 per cent at Pounds 67.1m.
The Danish group said in August that its full-year result would be
significantly influenced by two important investments earlier this year  -
Rentokil's acquisition of the Securigard Group and the Berendsen industrial
division's acquisition of the Lucas Fluid Power group.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Rhone-Poulenc named as next in French sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RHONE-POULENC, France's flagship chemicals group, will be the next to be
sold in the government's ambitious privatisation programme, the French
economy ministry said yesterday. The sale is expected within weeks,
depending on market conditions.
The announcement ended speculation that the government would capitalise on
the successful privatisation of Banque Nationale de Paris by bringing
forward the sale of its 50 per cent stake in Elf-Aquitaine, the oil group.
The privatisation of Elf would raise about FFr50bn (Pounds 5.8bn) compared
with the FFr15bn forecast from the sale of the government's 43 per cent
stake in Rhone-Poulenc.
Elf, which will be the third of 21 public sector companies to be privatised,
is expected to be sold early next year. Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy
minister, said Rhone-Poulenc was better prepared than Elf for privatisation.
The structure of the sale is expected to be similar to that of BNP, with
separate tranches for individual and institutional investors. The government
and Rhone-Poulenc will also create a core of stable shareholders, to
represent between 25 per cent and 35 per cent of the company's capital.
Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, Rhone-Poulenc chairman, is confident of a successful
privatisation as the partial sale in January, when the state sold 10 per
cent of the shares, was oversubscribed.
Observers in Paris also expected a smooth sale. 'The sharp rise in BNP's
share price yesterday will have whetted the appetite of individual
investors,' said one analyst. He said that shares in Rhone-Poulenc were also
likely to be attractively priced to maintain the momentum of the
privatisation programme.
However, Rhone-Poulenc is suffering from difficult markets. In the
first-half, net profits fell by about 11 per cent to FFr1.37bn, reflecting
depressed conditions in the bulk chemicals and fibres markets. The company's
healthcare operations, which last year generated 73 per cent of group
operating profits, have been hit by reforms in Germany and Italy.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Another attempt to clear the decks for recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS ALWAYS dangerous to call the turn in a company's fortunes, but
yesterday's profits warning and rights issue announcement from Trafalgar
House might just about mark the nadir for a company that has lurched from
problem to problem since its ill-fated takeover of Davy in 1991.
At least that is the way its new chairman, Mr Simon Keswick, of the Hongkong
Land group, presents it. Assuming its new convertible preference shares are
counted as capital, Trafalgar will have no net debt once its planned rights
issue is complete. It will also then have shareholders' funds appropriate to
its Pounds 4bn turnover.
'It'll be the strongest engineering conglomerate almost in existence,' says
Mr Keswick, adding that he believes gearing inappropriate for cyclical
businesses such as those in which Trafalgar House is engaged. He says
Trafalgar will have the financial strength to take equity stakes in the
privately financed infrastructure projects which are becoming increasingly
fashionable.
The aim of rebuilding Trafalgar's financial strength so that it can compete
in the construction and engineering project business also explains its
decision to reorganise its banking facilities. Its new arrangements with the
HSBC Group will reduce the number of its banking relationships to between
five and 10 from around 80.
Most importantly they will carry more flexible covenants. Though Trafalgar
will not admit it, it is widely thought the covenants under its old
arrangements limited the provisions it was able to make at the time of its
previous rights issue in February.
The new arrangements also involve enhanced foreign exchange and bonding
facilities - guarantees of performance normally required by the customer in
major construction projects - as a further means of improving the company's
competitive edge.
The vision of the new Trafalgar is one of a company centred on construction,
engineering and shipping. But yesterday's announcement also leaves few
doubts that a lot more effort will be required to turn the vision into a
thriving reality.
Trafalgar's decision to launch a rights issue in the form of
interest-bearing convertible preference shares rather than equity is a tacit
admission that, although it is sticking to its promise of a 2p final
dividend, it will be a long time before ordinary shareholders can expect
much of a return on their investment.
Moreover, the company has also been unable to dispose of unwanted assets as
quickly as it expected. The Ritz Hotel,for example, is likely to be taken
off the market and may be given closer management links with Hong Kong's
Mandarin group.
Trafalgar argues its latest write-downs are the result of a more exhaustive
appraisal of its business prospects. Its new finance director only arrived
in June, after its last rights issue in February when it announced
provisions of Pounds 100m, mainly on its commercial property portfolio.
That gives the impression that the decks are being cleared for recovery,
especially since the company indicated yesterday that it was now
experiencing a modest inflow of cash from a combination of advance payments
for contracts, better management of working capital and property sales.
Provided the momentum can be maintained, investors may give Hongkong Land
their support despite the unorthodox way it has taken control of the company
without making a full bid.
Mr Keswick says that, having paid USDollars 500m for its 25 per cent share,
Hongkong Land itself 'has taken a very considerable risk'. He also admits,
though, that UK institutions would be the first to round on Hongkong Land's
reluctance to take full responsibility itself if the new management failed
to make good.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Trafalgar warns on profits: Shares fall as rights issue is
confirmed; More provisions likely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARE price of Trafalgar House fell 11 1/2 p to close at 85p yesterday
after the construction and engineering group announced plans to raise up to
Pounds 400m in a rights issue and made a profits warning.
Analysts had pencilled in a profit of about Pounds 50m before tax and
provisions for the year to September 30. Profit estimates were reduced after
yesterday's announcement and the provisions figure raised.
Trafalgar House said it was getting independent valuations of its property.
As a result, it expected to make further substantial provisions in addition
to the Pounds 100m taken at the halfway stage.
One of the properties likely to be written down is London's Ritz Hotel,
currently valued at Pounds 85m, which the group has been trying to sell.
Another is the Emerald oil rig.
The convertible preference share issue will be the group's third cash call
in two years. Mr Simon Keswick, chairman, said that the growing engineering
and construction division required a stronger capital base.
Hongkong Land, which has a 25 per cent stake, confirmed that it would
subscribe for its full share of the issue, details of which will be
announced in December with annual results.
Mr Allan Gormly, chief executive, said that net debt had fallen below Pounds
300m by the end of September, and the group should be ungeared after the
rights issue.
It confirmed that the final dividend would be 2p per ordinary share, to be
paid from reserves. Mr Keswick said the rights issue would be made through
preference shares because investors were entitled to feel confident they
would get a return on their money.
The board has also arranged new credit and bonding facilities with the HSBC
Group. Mr Gormly said this would simplify the group's complex financial
arrangements.
He is stepping down as chief executive next August to become the chairman of
Royal Insurance Holdings. He will remain on Trafalgar House's board as a
non-executive director.
His replacement will be Mr Nigel Rich, 47, managing director of Jardine
Matheson Holdings, which controls Hongkong Land.
Trafalgar also said that Mr John Olsen, chief executive of Cunard and
managing director of the group's shipping and hotels division, had joined
the board.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Do It All trims for return to profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOOTS and WH Smith, 50-50 partners in Do It All, yesterday attempted to
deflate speculation about the loss-making do-it-yourself chain by announcing
a development and rationalisation plan.
The plan includes a roll-out of its new project-based trading concept to
another 38 stores at a cost of Pounds 10m, taking the total in the new
format to 82 by next autumn.
Other parts of the 223-store chain will be pared back through the sale or
closure of stores which are unprofitable or not amenable to conversion to
the new style. Boots said yesterday the action was being taken to make Do It
All cash positive in two years' time.
The number of shops to be closed or sold was simply described as
'significant'. Speculation that this could mean 50 stores was dismissed as
'rumours'. On average each store employs 27 people.
Do It All opened the first of the new format stores in July 1991. Sir
Malcolm Field, group managing director of Smith, said that, where
comparisons were possible, the converted shops were showing sales 10 or 11
per cent ahead of a year ago.
New product ranges were also being sold in the non-converted stores. Blanket
price discounting had ceased, although low prices were still important, he
added.
The statement was seen by analysts as an attempt to defuse criticism at
Smith's annual meeting tomorrow and Boots' interim results presentation in
two weeks' time. Aside from the commitment of the extra Pounds 10m, there
was little in the statement to surprise analysts.
Do It All said 'the intention is to dispose of as many of these poorly
performing stores as possible, closing only those which are unsaleable'. It
said the market for out-of-town retail sites was recovering and Do It All
was talking to several potential buyers. These are thought to include
carpet, furniture and electrical retailers as well as other DIY operators.
The Do It All chain was forged by the merger in 1990 of Smith's Do It All
and Boots' Payless. It has been hit by tough trading conditions and a fierce
price war. In Smith's annual results to the end of May, its share of the Do
It All loss was Pounds 14.3m.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Budgens' discount expansion on German model
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REWE, one of Germany's largest food retailers, is behind a move to open 40
discount food stores in the south-east of England over the next two years,
stepping up the continental European assault on the discount end of the
British market.
The private German company is acting through Budgens, the small UK food
retailing chain in which it already has a 29.35 per cent stake. By
underwriting a Pounds 30m fund-raising exercise by Budgens, Rewe could
increase its stake in the UK company to 47.1 per cent by 1995, which would
require it to launch a full bid.
Since April, when Rewe bought its initial 26 per cent stake, Budgens has
converted seven of its stores to a discount format and will open another
three by December.
Guided by visiting German executives, Budgens has developed a format called
Penny Market, which is modelled on Rewe's chain of 1,800 Penny Market
discount stores. Budgens said the range would be price-competitive and cover
the consumer's everyday shopping requirements, offering both branded and
unbranded goods.
The Penny Market stores will stock between 1,200 to 1,300 items - fewer than
the average Budgens store, which has 6,000 to 7,000 lines.
Several continental European discounters, attracted by the high profit
margins in UK food retailing, have opened stores in the last three years,
making discounting the fastest-growing area of the UK food market.
Budgens' shares yesterday closed 1p higher at 44p, valuing the company at
Pounds 71.5m. It will issue, subject to shareholders' approval, Pounds 30m
of convertible unsecured loan stock through an open offer and subscription
on the basis of Pounds 1 of nominal stock for every 5.424 of ordinary
shares.
The stock will be convertible at the price of 55p per share between 1995 and
2003. Because the conversion is set at a premium to the existing price, and
the offer is being fully underwritten by Rewe, the market expects the German
company will take up most of the loan stock.
Budgens said the funds would go to opening new discount stores and further
Budgens outlets. The group warned that sustained aggressive competition on
margins had adversely affected its results in the last six months.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Groupe Bull to get 'final' FFr7bn injection from state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING and ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH government yesterday announced a FFr7bn (Pounds 810m) capital
injection for Groupe Bull, the loss-making computer group, and the
replacement of its chairman.
Mr Gerard Longuet, French industry minister, said this would be the last
time the government would intervene to support Bull and the company would be
privatised as soon as possible.
Mr Bernard Pache, Bull's chairman since June 1992, is to be replaced by Mr
Jean-Marie Descarpentries, former chairman of Carnaud Metalbox (CMB), the
Anglo-French packaging group. Industry observers said Mr Descarpentries had
a reputation for tough action and was likely to move quickly to cut costs
and reorganise the group, which has lost about FFr15bn over the past three
years.
Mr Descarpentries is expected officially to take over in the middle of next
week. In a statement to Bull employees yesterday, he expressed confidence
that the company could be returned to profitability.
In addition to the FFr7bn allocation from the government, which Bull will
receive this year and next, the company's other principal shareholders are
expected to contribute. France Telecom, which owns 16 per cent, will provide
FFr1.6bn in new capital. NEC, of Japan, and IBM, of the US, which together
hold about 10 per cent, have been asked for FFr700m.
The capital raising will largely eliminate Bull's borrowings which stand at
about FFr9.5bn. But it is likely to arouse concern at the European
Commission. Earlier this month, the EC launched an inquiry into a FFr2.5bn
capital allocation for Bull made by the previous French government.
Mr Karel Van Miert, the EC competition commissioner, yesterday said the
commission would look closely at the latest capital injection.
The government is believed to be seeking a sale of its 73 per cent stake in
Bull next year.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Euro Disney to shed 950 jobs as part of corporate review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EURO Disney, the financially troubled leisure group, plans to cut 950 of the
11,100 jobs at EuroDisneyland, its lavish theme park near Paris, as part of
a corporate restructuring plan.
The proposed job cuts form part of Euro Disney's increasingly desperate
efforts to haul itself out of the red. The group, which has been badly
affected by the European recession and adverse currency changes, has asked
Walt Disney, its US parent company, for a guarantee of financial support
while it tries to restructure its finances.
Euro Disney has already made substantial job cuts since Euro-Disneyland
opened in April 1992.
The number of employees peaked at 19,000 in summer 1992, but had fallen to
16,000 by summer this year. Most of those cuts concerned seasonal staff
employed on short-term contracts, whereas the new cutbacks will dramatically
reduce the number of full-time employees.
Yesterday's rationalisation package, which will mainly affect Euro Disney's
administrative staff rather than the operational workforce at the park and
hotels, is the result of a comprehensive review of the group's corporate
structure.
Euro Disney, which is expected next month to disclose a net loss of about
FFr1.8bn (Pounds 209m) for the year to September 30, plans to merge the
management of the theme park and the hotels, which have previously been run
separately.
It will also forge closer links between the marketing and sales operations
of the EuroDisneyland complex.
The group will on Friday present the job cut proposals to its trade unions
for approval. Under French law, any job losses must be sanctioned by a
complex legal procedure which, Euro Disney estimated, would take about three
months.
In the meantime, Euro Disney is continuing negotiations with Walt Disney,
the powerful US leisure and entertainment group which is its 49 per cent
shareholder, over the terms of its restructuring.
Euro Disney, which is threatened by serious cashflow problems as business
slows during the slack winter season, needs an injection of capital to
reduce its debts and to stabilise its finances.
The company yesterday declined to comment on the progress of the
negotiations. However, the final restructuring package, which it initially
hoped to complete by early next year, could include a rights issue and
possibly an additional injection of capital from Walt Disney.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Morgan Guaranty cuts its prime rate as US bank finances
improve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MORGAN GUARANTY Trust of New York yesterday lowered its prime lending rate
from 6 per cent to 5.5 per cent, the first cut in prime rate by a large US
bank since July last year.
Harris Trust and Savings Bank also cut its prime rate to 5.5 per cent, but
large money centre banks yesterday showed no immediate sign of following
Morgan Guaranty's lead.
Yesterday's moves followed a quarter-point cut in prime rate to 5.75 per
cent in mid-September by several small regional banks. The prime rate serves
as a peg for loans to small companies, which account for about a fifth of
business borrowing, and for some consumer loans and mortgages. A general
decline in the prime would provide a modest stimulus for the economy.
However, the prime matters less than in previous decades because borrowing
costs for most large companies and for many home mortgages are determined by
money market rates.
Yesterday's cuts in prime rate do not reflect expectations of an easing of
monetary policy by the Federal Reserve: Morgan Guaranty economists expect
the next move in official short-term rates to be up rather than down. They
were instead an attempt to bring the prime rate closer to the federal funds
rate, which has been 3 per cent for more than a year.
The spread between the prime rate and the fed funds rate - at which banks
borrow from each other - has risen from about 1.25 percentage points in 1989
to 3 points or more in the past year, a very high level by historical
standards. In past business cycles, spreads have rarely exceeded 1.5 to 2
percentage points.
The widening of the spread was initially justified by the parlous state of
bank finances at the end of the 1980s. But in the past 18 months, bank
profitability has improved. The average return on assets has soared to
record levels; US banks are now better capitalised than many of their
foreign competitors.
Banks can thus afford to cut prime rate but have not done so because loan
demand from small companies and consumers remains weak.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Court imposes Pounds 172m damages: Samuel Montagu to appeal
against award to B&amp;C creditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAMUEL MONTAGU, the merchant bank, was ordered yesterday to pay damages of
Pounds 172m to the creditors of British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings, the
collapsed financial services group, after one of the lengthiest and most
complex pieces of litigation in City history.
Quadrex, a Delaware corporation controlled by Mr Gary Klesch, which employed
Samuel Montagu as its advisers, was also ordered to pay damages of Pounds
10m to B&amp;C. Samuel Montagu could be ordered to pay a further Pounds 8m in
December plus legal costs of about Pounds 10m arising from the litigation
which began more than five years ago.
Mr Justice Gatehouse ruled in the commercial court yesterday on the size of
the damages to be paid to the creditors of B&amp;C, which entered administration
in June 1990. He had ruled in May 1991 that both Quadrex and Samuel Montagu
were liable to pay damages to B&amp;C.
Samuel Montagu, a subsidiary of Midland Bank and Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking
Corporation (HSBC), said: 'We were surprised at the liability judgment and
we are very surprised at the quantum. We will be appealing. We believe we
are being pursued as the deep pocket.'
The bank had put into court Pounds 15m, without admitting liability, which
it had thought would enable a fair settlement.
HSBC, the parent bank, had made Pounds 80m provision to cover the cost of
paying the damages. Yesterday it disclosed that this was to be increased by
an additional Pounds 95m provision in this year's accounts.
The dispute arose over B&amp;C's 1987 takeover of Mercantile House Holdings.
This relied on an agreement that Quadrex would then buy Mercantile's
wholesale broking division. However, after the bid, Quadrex did not have the
money to make the purchase, which led to B&amp;C making a damages claim for
breach of contract.
B&amp;C also sued Samuel Montagu for negligent misstatement over assurances
given to B&amp;C by its then managing director and current deputy chairman, Mr
Ian McIntosh. The judge ruled that Mr McIntosh knowingly and negligently
took a risk in assuring B&amp;C that Quadrex had the funds to make the purchase
when the money was not in fact available.
Mr Peter Phillips, of accountants Buchler Phillips, working on behalf of the
B&amp;C administrators in the trial, said the award would represent 11p-16p in
the pound for B&amp;C Holdings creditors. Creditors are unlikely to be paid
until after appeals are heard on liability and the size of the damages,
scheduled to begin in January 1995.
Mr Oliver Greene, a managing director of Chase Manhattan Investment Bank,
one of B&amp;C's creditors said: 'This is a sensible result. The creditors
should feel reasonably happy with this charge.'

FT  19 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Waste Management
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Waste Management International has had a rollercoaster ride since 20 per
cent of its shares were offered for sale in April last year. Having
under-performed the market by 30 per cent in that period, the shares now
stand a shade below the offer price. Third-quarter figures are unlikely to
dispel lingering doubts. Delay in gaining government approvals for landfill
sites in Italy is the main reason for disappointment. Even assuming that WMI
can find a way through the Italian labyrinth, the episode underlines the
scope for political interference.
Stripping out construction profits which boosted the bottom line last year,
the waste business is still growing at around 25 per cent a year. The
group's prodigious acquisitions programme - 34 deals completed so far this
year - underpins this rate of progress. Earnings momentum depends on WMI's
ability to digest enough prey without swallowing a dud. Gearing does not
look especially high, at least under the US accounting rules the company
prefers. The snag is that amortising acquired goodwill through the profit
and loss account in the US manner - rather than writing it off to reserves -
shows earnings per share are no higher than this time last year.
With almost 70 per cent of the free float now held in the US, up from 45 per
cent at the time of flotation, that is of more than academic interest. The
long-term arguments in favour of waste management remain convincing, but WMI
will struggle to regain a premium rating.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
France's troubled computer maker may suffer from many of the same ills as
its one-time mentor IBM, but the French government has helped concoct a very
different remedy. The government will inject FFr7bn into the company to plug
the gaping holes in its balance sheet and is encouraging other shareholders,
such as France Telecom, IBM, and NEC to be similarly supportive. Such aid
seemingly flies in the face of the EC's strictures on state subsidies.
Computer rivals, such as Siemens, Olivetti and ICL will justifiably be
angered about the move, which is bound to prolong the agonies of the
European industry.
By itself, however, the recapitalisation will do little to ameliorate Bull's
woes. Radical restructuring will have to follow if the company is to have
any chance of surviving as a viable entity. The incoming chairman, Mr
Jean-Marie Descarpentries, is an iconoclastic industrialist who may well be
prepared to mince Bull's sacred cows into more palatable beefburgers. But it
will be a complex task. Bull's heavy reliance on mainframe computers has
left it vulnerable to nimbler systems. The company may be forced to cut
costs mercilessly and focus on more selective products and markets. It will
also have to move fast to resolve its troubles in the US market following
the disastrous Zenith acquisition.
Bull retains considerable technological strengths and a powerful position in
its home market. But unless Mr Descarpentries works wonders, the
government's hope for an early privatisation looks ambitious.

FT  19 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Do It All
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's statement from W H Smith and Boots on the future of Do It All
had the feel of a holding action. Perhaps that was inevitable, given that
press chatter was in danger of crowding out reality. Yet since discussions
about closing sites or assigning leases to others are at an early stage, the
vagueness on the cost of rationalisation leaves many questions unanswered.
There seems little alternative but to wait and see, since Do It All is
hardly going to compromise its negotiating position with potential buyers by
going public at this stage.
Nevertheless, with many sites on long leases, the costs of disposal could
well be considerable. They are clearly high enough to rule out the pain of
total closure at this stage. On the other hand, the increased spend on
converting more stores to the new trading concept is welcome. Both partners
are now prepared to back their faith that part of the chain can be made
viable with some new cash. At the previous rate of roll out, the new trading
concept was in danger of becoming an old trading concept before half the
stores had been converted. But the rest of the do-it-yourself market is
hardly going to stand still while Do It All fiddles. The so-called
category-killing retailers in the US have made their way by combining price
and range with service, a trend which will catch on in the UK. Do It All's
recovery still turns on the questionable assumption that it can become
sufficiently different to escape the shadow of its more successful rivals.

FT  19 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Trafalgar's call of duty
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Trafalgar House's decision to tap shareholders for up to Pounds 400m more is
a measure of the extent to which it was shaken to its very foundations in
the wake of the Davy affair. It hardly reflects well on the new management
to have announced yet more provisions so soon after the Pounds 100m charge
unveiled in February. The cynical view is that some of the bad news was held
back then for fear of breaching banking covenants. The more charitable
interpretation is that it has simply taken the new management this long to
uncover the size of the problem.
One might expect the company's fortunes to recover, albeit slowly, from now
on. But the leeway afforded by the new injection of capital is limited. As
this year's profits expectations have been lowered yet again, the base for
earnings and dividend growth looks disconcertingly small. Also, convertible
preference shares are an expensive form of finance. Trafalgar will have to
make the money sweat to produce a decent return.
That may not matter to Hongkong Land, which can take a long term view. It
cannot afford, however, to ignore other investors. For the time being, these
have little choice but to go along with its plan. They may even find the
preference shares attractive because they offer a secure yield as well as an
equity link. Switching prospects probably fuelled yesterday's 12 per cent
fall in Trafalgar's shares. But for the recovery plan to work, preference
holders must eventually exercise their conversion rights. That will require
the re-establishment of a progressive dividend. Hongkong Land must hope that
the institutions' patience will last.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Silent launch of the lifeboat: Robert Peston unravels a Bank
of England operation to avert a possible threat to the UK financial system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The life or death of City institutions is from time to time decided in the
18th century elegance of the Bank of England's Parlours, where the governor
and his court of directors have their offices.
One of these rare occasions, until very recently a closely guarded secret,
was the weekend of July 13-14 1991, when the then deputy governor, Mr Eddie
George - the current governor - launched a Pounds 240m financial lifeboat to
rescue two small banks, the National Mortgage Bank (NMB), a subsidiary of
the mortgage provider National Home Loans, and the City Merchants Bank, part
of the Invesco MIM investment group.
The Bank remains reluctant to discuss the episode in detail. However, it has
been learnt that in the following seven months the Bank intervened to
support two other institutions, Union Discount, a leading discount house or
trader in debt securities, and East Trust, a tiny East Anglian bank.
Large sums of public money were at risk. The Bank expects to make losses of
Pounds 115m on the loans it made to these institutions, mainly because of
the problems of National Mortgage Bank. As a result, the Bank last year cut
the dividend it pays the Treasury by almost Pounds 30m to Pounds 38m.
The Bank argues that the money was well spent because it prevented a domino
effect of failures among small banks. It says it followed its often repeated
policy of only intervening to save an ailing bank when there is a grave
danger to other banks or the financial system.
It is acutely conscious, it maintains, of the so-called 'moral hazard' that
if no bank were allowed to fail, depositors would not have to take into
account the soundness of a bank before deciding where to place funds, and
bank executives would feel under less pressure to manage their businesses
prudently.
So the question to be answered in analysing the 1991 lifeboat is how serious
was the threat to the banking system.
The central character in the rescue was Mr Brian Quinn, the Bank director
responsible for banking supervision. He became concerned that there was a
risk of a crisis about October 1990. The recession was causing an
unprecedented number of companies to go bankrupt, leading to problems for
the banks that had financed them. Those banks with above average exposure to
the property sector were facing the biggest losses.
Mr Quinn instructed the Bank's supervisory department to identify the
weakest banks and monitor them particularly closely. At this stage, he was
prepared to allow troubled banks to close. Between mid-1990 and the spring
of 1991, British and Commonwealth Merchant Bank, Authority Bank, Chancery
Bank and Edington all ran into financial difficulties and went into
administration.
However, the closure of these banks caused serious losses for one group of
wholesale depositors - local authorities, which had been attracted by the
higher interest rates available at smaller banks. They therefore started to
transfer their savings out of other small banks and into the big clearing
banks. Overseas banks and then big companies followed the local authorities'
lead.
This 'flight to quality', in Mr Quinn's words, accelerated after the closure
of the corrupt Bank of Credit and Commerce International, on July 5. In the
following eight days, wholesale depositors - and even some retail depositors
 -pulled their funds out of small banks at an alarming rate.
NMB's accounts show that institutions other than banks - mostly local
authorities - withdrew deposits totalling Pounds 292m in 1991, equivalent to
more than half its total deposit base. City Merchants Bank suffered in the
same way. These were the worst cases, but the Bank feared similar problems
could be faced by 40 others.
In the early stages of planning on how to deal with what the Bank regarded
as an emerging crisis, it hoped to persuade the clearers to contribute to a
lifeboat, since they had participated on the two previous occasions when the
Bank had organised a rescue: in 1973 the Bank and clearers launched a Pounds
1bn lifeboat to save a raft of small banks known as the secondary banks; and
in 1984, they provided financial support to Johnson Matthey Bankers, which
had run into difficulties because of bad loans.
However, on the most recent occasion when the clearers were sounded out, in
March 1991, they indicated that their days of risking their capital for the
good of the City were over. 'The clearing banks had become much more
profit-oriented, more hardnosed than in 1974,' says Mr Quinn. A clearing
bank chairman adds: 'We could not see why we should risk our capital to prop
up a competitor.' In any rescue the Bank would be on its own.
By the end of the second week of July, the rate of cash outflow at NMB and
the City Merchants Bank meant that without help from the Bank they would
have to shut their doors and cease operations within a matter of days. That
weekend, Mr Eddie George, Mr Quinn and senior managers from the supervisory
department were at the Bank deciding whether and how any such rescue should
be made.
The decision was difficult. NMB and City Merchants Bank were vulnerable
because they had imprudently relied too much on wholesale depositors, rather
than attracting a greater number of retail depositors, who tend to be more
loyal.
Though the Bank believed that in other respects NMB and City Merchants Bank
were sound - a false belief in the case of NMB whose financial position
continued to deteriorate and is currently being wound up - there was a case
for letting them collapse as a warning to other banks.
Mr Quinn has always maintained that a central bank should only intervene to
rescue a bank in order 'to prevent systemic failure'. The Bank would always
intervene if a clearing bank ran into difficulties and put at risk the
nationwide system for making payments. Similarly, it would take action to
prevent a general collapse of confidence in banks and building societies as
a safe haven for funds.
But the closures of NMB and City Merchants Bank were unlikely to have led to
such apocalyptic outcomes. They were not well known and were small. City
Merchants had loans on its balance sheet of Pounds 130m and NMB had made
loans of Pounds 431m. Indeed Mr Quinn says that he did not feel the clearing
banks were in 'any danger'.
There might have been a knock-on effect on confidence in building societies
from a closure of NMB, since it was owned by a high profile mortgage
provider, National Home Loans. At the time, investors' confidence in
building societies was at a low ebb and four weeks later there was a run on
a small society, the Southdown, which was subsequently merged with the
Leeds.
However, the precise nature of the risk to the financial system perceived by
the Bank was limited, says a government official, who took a close interest
in the episode. He says: 'The Bank feared there would be a loss of
confidence which would lead to a withdrawal of funds from a group of
medium-size banks. If a great number of those closed, that could have done
damage to the economy, by eliminating an important source of credit.'
The alarm at the Bank was great. One banker who visited it at about this
time says: 'I have never seen it in such a turmoil. It was like Waterloo
station, with doors slamming, people running about.'
Commercial bankers, however, dispute that many small banks would have had to
close. The better-known smaller banks were protected either by strong parent
companies or by balance sheets containing substantial cash reserves. 'The
idea that this was a repeat of the secondary banking crisis is a joke,' says
a senior clearing banker.
Nonetheless, Mr George decided to attempt a rescue. He sought the agreement
of the governor, the then Robin Leigh-Pemberton, now Lord Kingsdown, who
informed Mr Norman Lamont, the then chancellor.
The Treasury's permission would have been required if the Bank wanted access
to public funds in addition to its own resources. But the Bank had
sufficient capital on its own balance sheet. Despite this an official said
that the government viewed the Bank's arguments for intervening as
'plausible' and supported it.
Having decided to go ahead, the Bank then implemented the rescue in a way
designed to keep it a secret. The Bank feared that if it were seen to be
intervening - if its analysis of the weakness of the banking sector became
widely known - this would precipitate an even more serious run on deposits.
The clearers were to provide the rescue loans and pretend that they were
normal credit lines. However, these loans would be fully guaranteed by the
Bank. The clearers received a small payment for managing the loans.
Substantial fees and interest accrued to the Bank but it was also forced to
bear any losses on the loans. They were ,in effect, loans from the Bank.
Thus Barclays arranged a Pounds 200m loan from a syndicate of banks for NMB
and NatWest arranged a Pounds 40m facility for City Merchants Bank.
Though NMB and City Merchants Bank were secure for the time being, the Bank
continued to monitor small banks with exceptional thoroughness for many more
months. The next bank it rescued was the Norwich-based East Trust, which has
since closed. By the weekend of July 20-21, East Trust was planning to go
into administration because it had run out of cash.
The Bank put pressure on two of East Trust's bankers, Hambros and Royal Bank
of Scotland, to unfreeze credit lines and persuaded East Trust to continue
trading. On the following Tuesday, it told East to visit Barclays, which
unexpectedly offered it a Pounds 7m loan facility. It is not known whether
this facility was guaranteed by the Bank.
The Bank's final intervention to help an institution was in February 1992,
when a loan facility was arranged for Union Discount. This was a special
case, as Union was not a lending bank. It was, however, making big losses
due to a diversification into leasing.
As a discount house, Union enjoyed the privilege of dealing directly with
the Bank in the market for commercial and treasury bills. It was therefore
an important prop in the Bank's system for controlling monetary conditions.
The Bank wanted to ensure there was no possibility of Union running into
difficulties and it therefore arranged the loan for it.
However, Union today regards this facility as a mixed blessing, because of
the Bank's insistence that the loan be secret. Union wanted to raise capital
through a rights issue earlier this year, but was prevented from doing so
because under stock exchange rules it would have had to disclose the loan in
its rights issue document. Instead, it was forced to sell one of its best
businesses, Winterflood Securities.
After Union, there were no further rescues. But the Bank's anxiety about the
banking system was not dissipated till September 16 when sterling withdrew
from the exchange rate mechanism. The subsequent drop in interest rates and
signs of economic recovery made wholesale depositors less worried about the
impact of bankruptcies on the prospects of smaller UK banks.
A severe recession had been weathered without serious disruption to
financial markets. But the price paid for this stability was significant and
not merely in terms of the Bank's predicted losses from its rescue loans.
Another cost was the moral hazard of perpetuating the widespread belief that
the Bank prefers to rescue troubled banks rather than allowing the market to
sort the weak from the strong.
Bankers are always likely to question the Bank's motives when it launches
rescues because it combines the roles of lender of last resort and a
supervisor with responsibility for protecting depositors. Many believe that
the Bank is too concerned about the likely outcry from depositors in the
event of a bank failure and that it is therefore too quick to use its
lending powers.
The most effective way to minimise the moral hazard may be to demerge into a
new City watchdog the Bank's supervisory role as protector of deposits. If
the Bank retained only its lender of last resort function, its interventions
to rescue banks would be seen to be motivated by a concern for the health of
the financial system and not the wealth of depositors.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Leading Article: The Cyprus test
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BIENNIAL conference of leaders of the Commonwealth is the diplomatic
equivalent of cricket. It baffles foreigners, lasts as long as a five-day
test match, and the English team usually gets a drubbing from West Indians
and other nations who have adopted the game. It is also losing spectators.
The heads and representatives of 50 governments who meet in Cyprus this week
have to sharpen their performance and improve their image.
First the conference has to set aside past differences over South Africa.
Like the English cricketers who moan about Mr Curtly Ambrose's bouncers, Mr
Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, complains the Commonwealth has been
'distorted' by the long row between Britain and most other members over
apartheid.
This view is too partisan. Commonwealth members legitimately used every
opportunity to put pressure on Britain to impose economic sanctions against
Pretoria. It may well be that they were right. And it's worth remembering
that Commonwealth pressure on Britain at the 1979 conference in Lusaka
helped pave the way to an independent Zimbabwe.
What the row has done is to divert attention from the Commonwealth's
valuable work as a development agency. It can be even more effective if it
operates in a democratic environment. The Commonwealth must also recover an
integrity which has been undermined by its selective morality. It rightly
condemned the evils of apartheid; yet all too often turned a blind eye to
abuses by its authoritarian member states.
Reform is under way, but more should be done. Monitoring and publicising
human rights violations in member countries is one step. It should also be
made clear that members have subscribed to a set of principles that cannot
be broken with impunity.
The Commonwealth could decline into an irrelevant by-product of British
colonial history; or it could become a force for good governance, in a
constituency that embraces a quarter of the world's population, by putting
democratic principles into practice. Decisions in Cyprus could determine
which route it takes.

Two City giants seek lyrically-minded companions for adventure in verse
leading to possible publication.
Gog and Magog's little tome, Poems from the Square Mile, piqued Observer's
interest sufficiently to attempt to run to earth the two coyly anonymous
scribes.
No doubt well-informed by virtue of their privileged position guarding the
entrance to the Guildhall, the pair recently penned an irreverent collection
of verse and worse depicting the London financial community at work and play
 -the likes of 'If Walt Whitman had been a BCCI depositor', or, with
apologies to William Shakespeare, 'Where the firm sucks, there suck I'.
It transpires that Gog, alias barrister Anthony Belchambers, first put pen
to paper out of 'exasperation' and 'tedium' when, as general counsel to a
lobbying group, the so-called joint exchanges committee, he was earning his
crust attempting to cut through the growing tangle of rules and regulations
in the financial world.
Initially horrified at the idea of his specialist outfit stooping to poetry,
Cambridge publisher Martin Woodhead was won round to the idea, and is even
keen enough to want to repeat the exercise.
But newly appointed executive director of the Futures &amp; Options Association,
Belchambers is too busy (and too far back inside the establishment fold?) to
provide his share of the 1994 sequel.
Magog, who wishes to remain anonymous until he retires in about a year, will
offer some material, and Gog's pen has not dried up entirely. But Woodhead
wishes to tap the talents and frustrations of a broader section of City
folk.
Aspiring scribblers, teenage upwards, should submit copy, anonymously if
they wish, by the end of February 1994 to Martin Woodhead, managing
director; Woodhead Publishing Limited; Abington Hall, Abington, Cambridge
CB1 6AH.

The 'personal reasons' that Neil Johnson cited last week when he
unexpectedly revealed his intention to quit the Engineering Employers'
Federation before the end of the year seem to be of a rather unusual kind.
Deeply involved in the federation's talks concerning a proposed link-up with
the Confederation of British Industry, the engaging director-general now
lets on that his 'fundamental belief in the rectitude of the proposal' was,
'perversely', the reason for his going.
He felt the affair was becoming too 'personalised', which must surely
translate into the concern, that, were he to stay, the whole endeavour might
founder on the issue of which of the two federation chiefs, he or Howard
Davies, emerged as top dog.
Whatever his motives, Johnson's departure is unlikely to have done his
career much harm, for the Sandhurst-educated industrialist has proved
himself a highly articulate and affable advocate of the cause since his
arrival in July last year.
He has got away with saying some pretty damning things about the government,
even if he may have been a trifle demob-happy in his latest criticism of
Treasury officials as 'totally unspoiled by failure'.
He says he had several offers of non-executive directorships when time did
not permit him to say yes. He will be hoping the phone rings again.

<TEXT>
It couldn't be easier, could it? The leading candidate to run the European
Monetary Institute, forerunner of the future European central bank, is
technically qualified, politically astute, and deemed a heavyweight among
fellow European central bankers. The only snag is; he seems not to want the
job.
Dutch central bank governor Wim Duisenberg apparently regards the EMI post
as nothing compared with the power he already wields, not only in Amsterdam,
but also as a leading member of the committee of European central bankers.
Why else should he declare last weekend on German television that a single
European currency was 'decades away'? John Major could scarcely have put it
better.
The noose is tightening around Duisenberg, not least because Amsterdam's
11th-hour challenge to lure the EMI on to its soil is running out of steam -
despite deft manoeuvring by Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister.
Lubbers had made clear that he is no longer prime candidate for the job of
running the presidency of the European Commission when Jacques Delors steps
down in January 1995.
No doubt his calculation is that, in staving off accusations that the Dutch
were trying to pinch the biggest Euro-prizes, he would be lending
Amsterdam's EMI candidacy a helping hand.
Like the British and French, the Dutch are slowly facing up to the fact that
the EMI building will rise on German soil; Duisenberg is under pressure to
win its presidency as a consolation prize.
With his back to the wall, the reluctant Euro-banker is believed to be
demanding that he is allowed to stay on as central bank governor - a
condition already dismissed by one leading EC official as a 'non-starter'.
Others are watching with interest; hovering in the background is former
Italian prime minister Giuliano Amato, who was in the running to replace
Jacques Attali at the EBRD.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN ARGUING for the privatisation of British Coal ministers are at their most
convincing when they say the state is ill-equipped to run the industry. The
dead hand of the centre has rarely been more debilitating than now, as
British Coal prepares to move within 18 months to the private sector.
The problems stem from the white paper that the government was forced to
publish in March in response to the public outcry last year over its
proposed pit closure programme. This provided a reprieve for 12 of the 31
condemned pits, but did nothing effective to create the market on which
their survival depended.
The long-term future of the 12 was always doubtful. Miners at two of them
have already voted for closure, and hope has all but evaporated for the
remaining 10. Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman, admitted as much last
week and again yesterday. Also at risk, although he did not say it, are at
least another four of British Coal's 19 'core pits'.
So what is keeping them all open?
Officially British Coal is still conducting the 'market testing' exercise
designed to see if it can sell more coal to the electricity generators and
other potential buyers.
The reality is that after six months the exercise has resulted in no extra
sales and is unlikely to do so on anything like the scale required to save
the 12 pits. The delay in closure announcements owes more to government
concern over the political reaction than to market uncertainty.
This is no longer acceptable. After more than a year of doubt, the 20,000
remaining miners and managers deserve to know if they have a future in the
industry. Of course they want jobs, but they also want to know if they must
now plan an alternative future.
The gloom caused by the uncertainty is spreading even to the pits that are
highly unlikely to close and affecting morale (though commendably, it seems,
not yet productivity). The industry is producing nearly 1m tonnes a month
more than it can sell; putting it on stockpiles merely increases the
government's difficulties in finding a buyer to run the mines in the private
sector.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade secretary, is back at his desk this week after
his summer illness. He faces many difficult decisions, several of them in
energy. His first should be to sanction the closure of the doomed pits.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Leading Article: The Atlantic looks wider
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT BILL Clinton and his secretary of state, Mr Warren Christopher,
are not happy about the way their foreign policy is going. That is
understandable. They have discovered, like the leaders of almost every great
power in history, that great power status does not automatically give you
control of small crises. In Bosnia, Somalia and Haiti they have been defied
by people with only a tiny fraction of the resources they have at their
disposal, but who are (partly for that very reason) much more single-minded
and less scrupulous than their adversary about the use to which resources
are put.
In the absence of really big crises, small ones loom large. None of these is
entirely or even mainly of Mr Clinton's making. None in itself constitutes a
global problem, though all in their different ways are very unpleasant, and
have some serious implications for other countries in their respective
regions. It would have been difficult for any US administration to ignore
them, and almost any US administration would have tried to tackle them, as
Mr Clinton has, with a mix of diplomacy and force, sharing the burden as far
as possible with like-minded and interested partners under the aegis of the
UN and other international organisations.
Having run into difficulties with all three, Mr Clinton and Mr Christopher
have at least had the honesty to admit their mistakes. They would not be
politicians, indeed they would hardly be human, if they did not point to the
mistakes made by others as well. In Somalia, it is mainly the UN and its
unfortunate secretary-general that are taking the rap. In Bosnia, it is the
US's European allies, and especially the UK.
They richly deserve it, and would be ill advised to reply in kind. If blame
for the Bosnian tragedy must be apportioned, there is plenty to go round,
but Europe can hardly avoid the lion's share. It is after all happening in
Europe, on the very borders of the EC, and the EC in the early stages made
much of its peacemaking role. Within the EC, Britain commandeered the lead,
putting in two former foreign secretaries as successive chairmen of the
peace conference. It also sent troops, whose presence it has repeatedly used
as an argument to block US initiatives and to brush aside US criticisms. If
the troops had actually stopped the fighting or protected the victims, that
might be fair enough. Instead they have had to watch while the proclaimed
will of the international community, and all the most basic human rights,
have been repeatedly violated on a large scale.
That is still happening, and Britain along with other European countries has
clearly run out of ideas on what to do about it. American ideas might not
have worked any better, but American frustration that they have not been
tried is entirely understandable.
The tragedy is by no means over. European powers should be looking urgently
for new ways of dealing with it. They should listen with greater humility to
American views. And they should be concerned about the wider damage the
affair is doing to the transatlantic relationship.
The problems of the former Yugoslavia are ones which 'Europe', if it
existed, might reasonably be expected to handle on its own. Other issues are
genuinely insoluble without American commitment and co-operation - the most
obvious being the management of relations with an increasingly volatile
Russia, the conclusion of negotiations on a new framework for international
trade, and the redefinition of the role of the Atlantic alliance itself,
particularly in relation to the new security problems which have arisen in
central and eastern Europe.
In their frustration, Mr Clinton and Mr Christopher let slip something that
careful observers of the US have realised for some time: that relations with
Asia and the Pacific are now more important to it than relations with
Europe. Getting the American public to focus on global problems at all is
increasingly difficult, and economic concerns now tend to loom larger than
military ones. Europe needs to work harder both on solving its own problems
and on engaging US interest in those that need it. It can no longer take US
interest for granted.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Opt-out no incentive for jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NEIL DERRICK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Hunt, the employment secretary, has opted out of the real world
if he believes that saving the jobs of newspaper boys and girls ('UK wins
opt-out on labour law', October 13) will lead to an increase in
multinational investment in the UK. Presumably we shall see yet more adverts
encouraging foreign companies to take advantage of Britain's low-paid,
long-suffering, unprotected yet 'wildly enthusiastic' youth.
The fact is that David Hunt's claim that the British opt-out of European
laws protecting 16- and 17-year-olds will lead to multinationals moving to
Britain is sheer nonsense. Figures produced by the GMB taken from the 1991
census show that 16- and 17-year-olds make up just 2.29 per cent of the
British workforce. The idea that this deregulation will persuade employers
to uproot and move to the UK for such marginal reasons is ridiculous.
The government can hardly claim that the lack of statutory protection of
wages or conditions will lead to more jobs being created for young people.
Self-evidently it has not. Britain has 1m young people out of work.
Unemployment among 18- to 25-year-olds is twice as high as in the rest of
the population; they earn less than the rest, about 53 per cent of average
earnings.
Just what young people are supposed to make of this government's antics is
beyond me. These days ministers only ever refer to young people as future
recipients of custodial sentences, drains on the welfare state, or queue
jumpers in the housing waiting list.
David Hunt ought to be addressing Britain's skills gap and the training
needs of young people today. Perhaps then multinationals might consider
locating in the UK.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Too popular for own good: Nato needs to form a policy on
enlargement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nato is in a fix about eastern Europe. Its efforts to build links with its
former foes, in a region which for 40 years was tacitly recognised as the
Soviet Union's domain, have succeeded only too well.
Public enthusiasm for Nato is more apparent in countries such as the Czech
Republic or Poland than in the allied nations themselves. Half a dozen
countries are queueing at Nato's door. Several former Soviet republics could
also become candidates. It is a situation that Nato does not know how to
resolve.
Allies know that their summit meeting planned for January 10 cannot duck the
issue. They will want to send a clear signal that the door to membership is
open, but at the same time try to win eastern European countries over to the
idea that there may be an acceptable alternative, short of membership.
What Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary general, has already indicated they
are unlikely to do is set a timetable or identify candidates.
Defence ministers of the 16 allies will discuss relations with eastern
Europe in an informal meeting starting tomorrow in the German seaside resort
of Travemunde. But neither the US nor any of its main allies has yet formed
a policy on enlargement.
'There's going to be an enlargement at some point. Nobody believes we're
going to stay at 16 members for ever,' said a senior Nato diplomat. But in
the corridors of allied headquarters in Brussels there is little enthusiasm
for new admissions. One European official warned: 'We are creating
expectations which we do not have the means to fulfil.'
Former Warsaw pact members have been encouraged by Nato's efforts to promote
co-operation since the pact collapsed in 1991. Nato saw an active role in
eastern Europe as the way to justify its own continued existence and keep
political support in the US.
But Nato is in no hurry to extend its security guarantees to new borders.
Membership of Nato, under Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, commits
members to assist each other against attack. In practical terms this means a
US guarantee to its European allies, backed by US conventional and nuclear
forces. 'It's honestly up to the Americans,' said a European diplomat at
Nato. But the US Congress would probably be most reluctant to extend the
protective umbrella.
The second obstacle, and Nato's main pretext for hesitation, is Russia. If,
by integrating Moscow's one-time allies, Nato makes Russia feel isolated and
insecure, it could damage rather than improve global stability.
This dilemma has worsened since this month's bloody confrontation between
President Boris Yeltsin and rival factions in Moscow. Eastern Europe is
looking more anxiously towards the west for security. But Nato is even more
concerned not to create problems for Mr Yeltsin.
Oddly, it was Mr Yeltsin who put enlargement on the Nato summit agenda. In
Warsaw in August, under persuasion from Poland's President Lech Walesa, he
stated that Russia would not see Nato enlargement as being against its
interests. This shook Nato, which then had to start thinking seriously about
it.
The next month, Mr Yeltsin corrected his position, proposing that Nato and
Russia should jointly guarantee eastern Europe's security. He also argued
that Nato had implicitly agreed not to expand eastwards at the time the
status of united Germany was settled in 1990. Both suggestions are firmly
rejected by Nato.
However, there is no consensus in Nato about how far it should envisage
expanding. There are three groups of actual or potential candidates. Top of
the list, but not necessarily all together, come the 'Visegrad four' -
Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia. Romania and Bulgaria are
also keen, but are considered less ready. Former Soviet republics may look
to Nato, although this is currently too sensitive an issue with Russia.
There are also different schools of thought about Russia itself. In December
1991 Mr Yeltsin declared a 'long-term political aim' of membership. But
Russia has not pressed its candidacy, and some allies see it as 'too large,
too Asian and too backward' ever to join.
Among the main European allies, Germany has been the most supportive towards
central European applicants, particularly its outspoken defence minister, Mr
Volker Ruhe. But he has recently taken a more cautious line. The UK and
France are both wary. The US is also uncomfortable with the emphasis given
to the membership question.
Nato will try to match any gesture it makes towards enlargement with a
parallel upgrading of defence relations with Russia and Ukraine. The summit
can also be expected to try to inject more substance into the North Atlantic
Co-operation Council, set up as a talking shop for Nato and the former
Warsaw pact countries including Soviet successor states in Europe and Asia.
Special arrangements are under discussion in Nato for the countries that
feel entitled to membership and that have done most to reform their military
along Nato lines. The Washington Treaty, while allowing for other European
countries to be invited to join, makes no provision for associate
membership. But there could be affiliation agreements. This would, in
effect, extend to the countries concerned the consultation procedures
foreseen in Article 4 of the treaty in the event of a security threat, but
not the commitment to mutual armed assistance contained in Article 5.
'We're in no position not to accept affiliation,' said a Polish official.
But he warned it would be seen in Poland as just a first step towards entry.
'It might work in January, but already by March or May it would be
insufficient.'
Some members are pushing for Nato admission to be linked to countries'
accession to the European Community. As EC members, they would have the
option of belonging to the Western European Union, with its own mutual
security guarantee. This would avoid having to set specific criteria for
Nato membership. But officials in candidate countries believe it may mean
waiting too long.
Mr John Chipman, director of the London-based International Institute for
Strategic Studies, said these countries had given too much importance to
Nato, failing to see that their long-term security lay in economic
integration in the EC. 'Is it absolutely certain that Nato will be useful to
them in the future?' he asked.
European allies are also worried that Nato, in its concern about eastern
Europe, is being distracted from its own 'family problems' - crucially, the
balance in the alliance between the US and western Europe. This has been
highlighted by President Bill Clinton's latest remarks about the UK and
French record over Bosnia.
The European allies want the summit to produce a reaffirmation of US
commitment. 'Nato's problem is this relationship: what do they want to do
together?' said one diplomat. 'If Nato has a problem of raison d'etre, it's
not in enlargement that it will find another raison d'etre.'

FT  19 OCT 93 / Bottom line on Buthelezi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It will soon be time to call Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's bluff. I refer to
the Zulu prince who heads both the KwaZulu government and the Inkatha
Freedom party. The great black hope of conservative whites in Natal and
elsewhere has battled hard for his chance to rule his bit of a South Africa
that seems likely to be governed by the African National Congress, perhaps
in alliance with President F W de Klerk's National party. He is the leading
figure in the 'Freedom Alliance', which brings together leaders of three
black 'homelands' and two potential rulers of a white redoubt. All want
their own dunghills over which to crow, but their unifying objective, the
preservation of minority rights, is not unworthy.
Chief Buthelezi's methods, are, however, becoming dangerous. His
recalcitrance is one of the principal obstacles to agreement on South
Africa's future. An outcome not impossible to imagine might be an
Angolan-style civil war. Underlying Britain's caution over matters South
African is the fear of such a catastrophe. Southern Africa would
disintegrate. There are perhaps 1m British passport-holders in the republic,
and untold billions of capital invested in its future. The maintenance of
stability is a prerequisite for all else.
Not everything Mr Buthelezi says is wrong. His call for a federal-style
solution has merit. His political behaviour, which is characterised by
walk-outs and threats, is, however, becoming unsustainable. Both President
de Klerk and his fellow Nobel laureate, Mr Nelson Mandela, are trying direct
negotiation, in parallel with the multi-party process. They should offer a
future Zulu-governed province (call it a state) maximum autonomy. In the
nature of things, that would have to fall short of the quasi-independence
Inkatha and its allies appear to want.
Having declared their bottom line, the putative majority rulers of a unified
South Africa should stick. If Chief Buthelezi then continues to use wrecking
tactics, he should be disregarded. The negotiators at the republic's
constitutional talks must meet the reasoned arguments put by Inkatha, but
the Zulu prince may have to be faced down. You cannot placate the
implacable.
We are talking here about a very diff-icult man. He is honoured in the 1994
edi-tion of the Guinness Book of Records for delivering the longest known
speech ever made. This achieve-ment was recorded at his legislative assembly
in KwaZulu between 12 and 29 March this year. He was not on his feet for
every moment. He actually spoke on 11 of the days of debate, averaging 2 1/2
hours a day. That makes Fidel Castro's 4 1/2 hours at the United Nations in
September 1960 seem like a masterpiece of brevity. It makes even our own Mr
William Cash, the anti-Maastricht rebel Tory MP, sound succinct.
I have some personal experience of the chief's ability to expand on his
thoughts. I visited him in Ulundi, the capital of the Zulu 'homeland', a few
years ago. The two of us sat in his cabinet room alone, save for the
photographs of Himself meeting Thatcher, Reagan and the like. (Lady Thatcher
was always a particular admirer of his.) He spent some 45 minutes, which
felt like twice as long, reading from a statement prepared to mark my visit.
This was subsequently given to the news agencies.
That task completed, we took lunch with the KwaZulu cabinet, which was as
servile as that of the Lady then in office back in London. I was sent home
with a bound typescript, 147 single-spaced pages of it. It was Mr
Buthelezi's recent policy speech to his assembly. When I have told this
story to others who have met him, the response has been 'so what else is
new?'
Yet verbosity does not mean that his case is all bad. Putting my own gloss
on the element of it that should be heard out, it is this: the ANC, which
maintains its alliance with the South African Communist party, cannot be
trusted to rule South Africa in a democratic fashion. If it wins the first
non-racial election, it may share power, as promised, with the previously
white supremacist National party, but the two of them will together impose
autocratic rule, suppressing most freedoms. Eventually the traditional
African dictatorship will prevail, with the ANC crocodile swallowing the
Nats who ride on its back.
To my mind one touchstone might be: will there be a need for a Helen Suzman
in the new South Africa? Would such a person be permitted to preach justice
and freedom with the unswerving bravery of Mrs Suzman? Her memoirs, In No
Uncertain Terms (Sinclair-Stephenson, Pounds 17.99), eschew the catchpenny
vitriolics of another famous lady's tome published this week, but they tell
a story of greater nobility. Mrs Suzman stood alone and vilified, the sole
progressive MP in the apartheid assemblies of Cape Town, from 1961-74. She
had no power, save that of her clarity of vision, yet she represented
democracy in an undemocratic country for 36 years. We must all salute her.
South Africa will only be truly democratic when there is no need to ask the
Suzman question. Yet the 'Freedom Alliance', none of whose five leading
protagonists appears to be a true democrat, can go only so far with
protestations about future minority rights. Who would be a Suzman or an
opposition supporter in a quasi-independent KwaZulu, Ciskei, Bophutatswana
or Boer Free State?
Outsiders should do what little they can. The Commonwealth, whose heads of
government meet in Cyprus tomorrow, has not completed its South African
mission. It should nudge the ANC/government alliance towards further
constitutional safeguards and the 'Freedom Alliance' towards acceptance.
Together with the EC, and the UN it will have much to say on post-election
economic assistance for the new republic.
Britain is, inevitably, a leading player in this delicate game. Its
post-colonial responsibility to Southern Africa cannot be shucked off. It
has too much to lose. So far, it has maintained its credentials with both
sides. Mr Mandela called in last week; Mr Buthelezi some time before that.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, has treated the latter with infinite
patience - so far. He has listened at length and resisted the temptation to
lecture in return. This cannot go on. Even in Mr Hurd's world of finely
balanced diplomatic niceties there has to be a bottom line somewhere.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Flaws in rail privatisation proposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof FRANCIS R TERRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'Case for rail privatisation' (October 15), is a brave
attempt to find some value in a policy that is fundamentally flawed. If the
infrastructure of track and signalling is separated out, and probably
retained indefinitely in public ownership, the private sector train
operators will find about two-thirds of their costs, and a major area of
investment, completely outside their control. The proportion would be even
higher if ancillary functions like station services and car parking are
taken into account. It is this constraint, together with the fragmentation
of the network into much smaller franchised units, which is both deterring
the private sector and driving the most successful railway managers out of
the industry.
Railway track is not like gas pipes or electricity cables: modern technology
means that it is part of an integral system with the vehicles. Its
characteristics effectively govern speed, passenger comfort, service
frequency and, not least, safety. Yet these are the factors which the
management of a private railway would presumably want to promote. Railways
have for many years been competing hard with other modes of transport,
usually on a playing field which is far from level, and there is no sign
that the new regime on Gatwick services will make the slightest difference
to the volumes of passengers moving there by road. As for competition on
rail, it has long been possible to choose a cheaper service than Gatwick
Express, by boarding a Brighton-bound train and taking five minutes longer
for the same trip.
If we start by accepting that the losses suffered by railways almost
everywhere will never make BR a saleable proposition in the style of other
utilities, an alternative solution is required. BR could be converted to a
mutual organisation, rather like a building society.
This would subject it to the same business disciplines as a private company
and would open the door to raising finance outside the public sector.
Services producing surpluses would be reinvested, under a not-for-profit
constitution - and we could have all the excitement of a public issue
subscription, with attractive concessions for season-ticket holders and
others who invest above a certain level.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER KILBORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your readers who saw that the book trade expects a 5 per cent reduction
in book sales as a result of VAT being imposed might well feel that the
industry is protesting too much ('Industry tries to fend off the VAT man',
October 11). In fact, our estimate of the likely reduction, based on
detailed economic analysis, is at least 15 per cent, which makes all the
difference between a relatively minor hardship and a catastrophic body blow.
No industry could absorb such a loss of revenue without drastic upheavals:
in the book business, we would expect to see many bookshop closures and
10,000 or more jobs lost, not to mention a substantial reduction in the
number and variety of books published.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Absurdity of red tape in education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr WILLIAM WALLACE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Thank you for your editorial, 'Cutting red tape' (October 11).
Ministers, as you say, find this a splendid subject for rhetoric; but have
shown little skill in distinguishing necessary regulation from unnecessary
form-filling.
The situation in education, from universities to primary schools, is the
most absurd. In the name of 'marketisation', more and more information is
being required from teachers; more forms to fill, more outside inquiries,
more lengthy sets of regulations (altered by each new minister every 18
months or so) to be read and implemented. The national curriculum has been
subjected to endless, often seemingly arbitrary, changes, each requiring new
handbooks and standards. The amount of information demanded from
universities - on the details of research output, teaching methods,
utilisation of resources - must now be far higher than the regulatory system
has the capacity to absorb: an outcome worthy of a socialist system in
decline. Right-wing prejudice against the teaching profession - there can be
no other explanation - has carried free-marketeers to the opposite extreme.
I recall many years ago that Marks and Spencer swept away many of its
internal stock-checks and paper-filling, made it clear that it trusted its
staff, and gained an impressive net saving. A rational government would come
to the same conclusion about the proliferation of paper in the education
field. There is sadly little evidence of rational educational policy-making
within the present government, however.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Charity tax relief should be
abolished
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr WALTER MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, A debate on the future of charities is timely, but I comment here on
only one aspect. Tax.
Tax exemption should be withdrawn from all charities. It is not so much the
distortion that it causes in the fiscal balance (along with exemption for
pension funds and mortgage interest), but charity, properly speaking, is a
personal and voluntary matter. Why then are we, as taxpayers, compelled to
contribute to countless causes of which we know nothing and of some of which
we may disapprove?
It is no argument to say that we cannot control how our taxes are spent,
other than at the ballot box. There are expenses of the state which must be
paid for, whether some of us like it or not. This is not so with charities,
support of which by the state is not essential and which detracts from the
voluntary concept.
The charity scene is getting out of control. Countless small organisations
are becoming registered as charities with no object other than getting tax
relief, the amount of which will be trivial, and with the charities having
little understanding of the onerous legal and administrative obligations
which they incur. The vague definition of what is charitable enables some
very strange causes to qualify. If tax relief were abolished, there would be
no reason for the Charity Commissioners to be concerned.
I am a trustee of a substantial endowed charity which makes good use of its
refunds, but if they were withdrawn over a period we should learn to live
without them. We might then deregister, if that were possible.
Charitable status has caused us enormous expense in order to comply with
legal requirements for transactions the purpose of which was, by common
consent, entirely proper. I have yet to find any benefit other than tax
relief. These are not necessarily the views of my co-trustees.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Arts: Nicholson in perspective / Review of the exhibition at
the Tate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ben Nicholson, who died early in 1982 at the age of 87, was by then the
Grand Old Man of British modernism, the painter Tweedle-dum to Henry Moore's
sculptor Tweedle-dee, and had long enjoyed an international reputation. He
was loaded with honours, Order of Merit (1968), Rembrandt Prize (1974),
Ulisse Prize (Venice Biennale 1954), and could have had more had he accepted
all that were offered him, for he was, notoriously, as tricky a man in his
professional as in his personal life.
The centenary of his birth falls next April and it has been suggested that
this retrospective at the Tate is something of an exercise in
rehabilitation. Well, one can never answer for the young, but for anyone a
little older, it can hardly be so. For my now-fiftyish generation, he was
always there or thereabouts, still in the centre of the cultural stage he
had commanded since at least the 1930s.
He surely was the acceptable arbiter of English modernism, holding the ring
between figuration and abstraction, between romanticism and constructivism,
between a seductive native sensibility, founded in the experience of
landscape and still-life, and the harder currency of the international avant
garde. For most of the cultivated, educated yet unspecialised British
gallery public, he still is.
Ben Nicholson is indeed a significant figure in the history of British
painting in the 20th century, but significance takes many forms and not
always those that the apologist would wish. Coming as it does with so
conventional a timeliness, and being so well chosen and displayed, what this
retrospective offers is not rehabilitation but rather a proper reassessment.
He was born to the purple of British art, son of the painter, William
Nicholson and his wife Mabel, an artist herself and sister to another,
Nicholson's friend and sometime colleague, James Pryde. His father was his
first serious influence, and was always to remain an informing if
unacknowledged presence in the work. From him came the strength and clarity
of design, the sharpness of silhouette and contour, above all the ease and
elegance of brush and paint across the surface of the canvas. Nicholson pere
was ever the dandy and the aesthete in his work, as in himself, and it would
always be so with the son.
But it is not a simple case of the son looking to the father to make a
start, and then moving on in his own way. Having decided upon a career as a
painter, nothing but conspicuous success would do. And if Ben would never
willingly accept second place among his peers, how much more difficult it
was for him openly to allow the precedence that was his father's due. The
extent of the creative debt he owed his father has yet to be examined, but
it is of the first importance to any understanding of the work.
If paternal influence is so crucial, what of that of succeeding professional
associations. To walk round this show is to find oneself ticking off the
particular references, one by one. Here are Winifred Nicholson, Ben's first
wife, his old Slade friend, Paul Nash, Christopher Wood who died so young,
and the old Cornish primitive, Alfred Wallis. And here are his second wife,
Barbara Hepworth, and her old rival, Henry Moore, and all the Parisian
artists to whom his father's contacts gave him access - Braque, Picasso,
Mondrian, Gabo.
The questions ask themselves: Whose, quite, were the ideas, whose the
originality? Was Ben just another clever, well-placed young man who wanted
to be an artist, and made himself one not by talent and inner necessity, but
by sheer force of will? Was it simply his luck to be not only who he was,
but where, surrounded by artists, and when? For it was modernism that gave
him his chance, with its technical simplicities, and its essential. rarified
self-consciousness. Anything more difficult would have found him out, as it
never found out his father.
What, in short, we have in Ben Nicholson is an artist who inherited not his
father's intuitive talent and instinctive visual originality, but rather an
infinite sophistication and intellectual resource. What were passed on to
him were critical antennae of the utmost sensitivity, that could tell him
just what was significant, original, useful in the work of his friends, to
take and make his own. He never did anything truly original in his life, his
originality, such as it is, lying only in the discrimination of his
interest, his judgment, his taste.
Who would then say he was a cynic? These things may work at the deepest
level, and his ambition, at least, was sincere enough. Do we set too much
store, perhaps, on originality for its own sake? The show is studded with
paintings of a delicacy and visual wit that are entirely convincing and
captivating as they are. That they tend to be the smaller works, and the
less self-conscious, as though the artist for once has forgotten himself in
his interest in the work and its relation to the visible world, only makes
the point.
The window-sill still-lifes of the 1940s, with the hills and harbours of
west Cornwall beyond, are especially fine in just this way. And when, later,
they are amplified onto a more public scale, their imagery abstracted, so
the emptier and more evidently formulaic they become. The irony is that it
was by these larger works of the 1950s that the international reputation was
finally confirmed.
The carved reliefs in the last room are still large enough, but much more
simple and physical in their imagery and the working of the surface. And
they seem to bring him back to himself, by now a little old-fashioned in the
context of the time, and perhaps at last indifferent to the exigencies of
the career, and the better for it. It is as strong, and original, a set of
work as any.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Arts: 'Zampa' woos Wexford - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Under its intrepid artistic director Elaine Padmore, the Wexford Festival
Opera has had yet another unlikely success, in the form of Zampa, ou La
Fiancee de marbre. Again Miss Padmore has assembled just the right team for
a work that few companies would risk now; and getting it so well together,
for the third consecutive 'first night' of the Festival, was a triumph in
itself.
Normally, the composer Ferdinand Herold (1791-1833) is mentioned on this
page only when Clement Crisp reviews his ballet La Fille mal gardee. But he
wrote more than 20 operas too, mostly for the Paris Opera-Comique; not long
after the famous Fille came Zampa, and then - just before his early death
from tuberculosis - Le Pre aux clercs. Those two kept his name alive for
many decades; but no more.
Zampa is a sort of 'operetta semi-seria'. Wresting the lovely Camille
brutally from her poor fiance Alphonse, the fierce corsair Zampa forces her
to marry himself; but he is haunted by a statue of Alice, a girl he ruined
years before, and before he can deflower Camille - there is a lot of
intervening byplay - the statue drags him down to hell. Alphonse is pleased
(but less pleased to learn that Zampa was his elder brother). Meanwhile, a
similar triangle between Camille's maid, her new swain and Zampa's first
mate is played out as comedy.
Whereas the darker strand in this mock-Sicilian story was once thought too
sombre for the Opera-Comique, the modern worry would be that the farcical
sub-plot is too routine to buoy up the melodrama. The producer Tim Hopkins'
solution is to guy everything, without mercy. Passionate embraces teeter
off-balance. The piratical menace is ludicrously OTT, and for Zampa's
wedding his crew doll up in gold lame tops and leopardskin skirts.
The comics do their stuff with such dogged earnestness that it turns into a
higher-order joke; the chorus's routined reactions-and-gestures are drawn
out to the point where they become weird and mad. It is all a bit
end-of-term, and in a larger house with a less convivial audience it might
not work, but at Wexford it is cheerfully infectious. Hugely assisted by the
young conductor Yves Abel, fresh from promoting the cause of French opera in
New York: for verve and style (not over-conscious), he cannot be faulted.
The Festival Chorus and the National Symphony play up with a will, and the
dusty period charm of Herold's score - which really offers nothing much
more, expert though it is - brightens into momentary life. As Camille the
American Mary Mills is delicious, with her bell-bright soprano. Her
compatriots John Daniecki (Zampa) and Bradley Williams (Alphonse) wield
nicely contrasted high tenors Jutta Winkler is a fine, lugubrious mezzo, and
her excellent would-be and ex-husbands are Antoine Normand and the chunky
Valentin Jar. A very good time is had by all.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Arts: Fun with The Bard - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Whelan is one of the best contemporary British playwrights. If his
work has a fault, it is that he is a bit long on research and short on fun.
See, for examples, The Bright and Bold Design about politics in the
Potteries, and School of Night about the politics of Christopher Marlowe. In
short, he is a trifle earnest.
This has now been rectified in a glorious new entertainment called
Shakespeare Country. The erudition remains, but there is champagne to go
with it. The piece is a wonderful mixture of pure wit and sheer corn.
Shakespeare country is what it is: Stratford-upon-Avon on Midsummer night.
The RSC is actually playing the Dream, tickets changing hands for fabulous
prices on the black market. The actors playing Oberon and Titania are about
to get married in real life. Visitors arrive from Germany, the US and Japan,
all of them admirers of the Bard. Everyone goes off to the woods and much
the same happens as in Shakespeare's play: confusion all round, except that
here the agent is not a fairy potion, but a Japanese 'friendly tablet' taken
in coffee.
The scholars among them specialise in esoteric subjects like Shakespeare's
foot fetishes. The American claims to be a direct Shakespeare descendant
through an illegitimate line. He has discovered a play called Love's
Labour's Wonne, (the famous elusive text if it ever existed), but thrown it
away because Shakespeare would never have spelled 'wonne' like that. The
Japanese phones his company in Tokyo in his excitement about the effects of
the tablet. A British army sergeant turns up to evict them for their
cavorting on what has become the property of the Ministry of Defence. He,
too, turns out to be a Shakespeare lover. All ends happily, of course, just
like the Dream.
Shakespeare text is cleverly woven throughout the play, but there is the
voice and sheer fun of Whelan as well. Who can resist this line? 'It's not
the policemen getting younger, it's the King Lears getting younger, that
makes me feel old.' There is a lovely scene when the tablets get mixed up
and the elderly German man falls for the young Japanese male. And who would
have guessed that you could turn Shakespeare's sonnet 'Shall I compare thee
to a summer's day?' into a song and sing it all the way through, country and
western style? It could be a hit; certainly it has very good words.
The whole evening is a delight. The occasion is the second Biennal sponsored
by British Telecom under which the same play is performed at the same time
in about 50 amateur theatres around the country. I saw it as the admirable
Questors in Ealing, where the part of the English academic is played by
Whelan's wife Ffrangcorn. There are still a few performances to go in the
course of this week in places stretching from Wrexham to Carlisle and
Brighton. Catch one where you can.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Arts: Women, Space, Light and Dance / Review of Sara Rudner
and others in the Dance Umbrella season
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A lone woman invading space. This idea, this image of a female pioneer, goes
deep in American modern dance, and it is as old as the century - it goes
back to Isadora. American women at the turn of the century were asking
questions, posing challenges, thrusting into the unknown. American modern
dance has had its great male dancers too, but they have demonstrated a less
investigative, more secure, attitude to space. For some American women, even
now, unoccupied space is an opportunity for adventure and drama.
To make stage space dramatic, however, you also need light. Even before
Isadora, the American dancer Loie Fuller was a pioneer of lighting. And Many
great dances by George Balanchine and by Martha Graham were lit, famously,
by a woman - Jean Rosenthal, who, by all accounts, made as much out of
unadorned space as Wieland Wagner. Today, the leading lighting designer in
dance is Jennifer Tipton; and last weekend at Riverside Studios Sara Rudner
and Dana Reitz danced, in silence, barefoot, to her lighting.
'The divine Sara' as she has been nicknamed (with her beautiful mane and
striking cheekbones, there is a Bernhardt resemblance), Rudner is mainly
famed as the greatest dancer to belong to Twyla Tharp's company, inspiring
roles in great Tharp dances from The Fugue (1970) to The Catherine Wheel
(1980), and she still returns to dance with Tharp at regular intervals.
But Rudner has long been also a soloist in her own choreography. Moving
alone in light, she is always sensuous and rich-toned. She uses her own
weight powerfully - much about her dancing reminds me of Lynn Seymour - and
with luscious complexity: shimmying, arching, rippling, falling. As she
addresses the light, or discovers it, or turns her back on it, she is, by
turns, innocent, merry, heroic, bleak. The many moods her dancing has are as
marvellous to behold today as when I first saw her in 1980, and what is most
beautiful of all is her utter absorption in them.
Dana Reitz, whose career has been chiefly as a soloist, has a quieter and
more ironic style. She may be proceeding slowly in waves and curves in one
direction, when suddenly the sharp flip of a wrist behind her back will
register as a gesture of contradiction. She is an elegant dancer, but part
of her elegance lies in being somewhat detached. Her whole physical tone is
cooler than Rudner's, and the way she carries her head adds a quality of
intellectual commentary. This weekend, these two soloists shared the stage,
and the light, with perfect accord.
As for Tipton's lighting, it was astounding. A dancer might be lit from a
high white light behind, or silhouetted against a suddenly azure backdrop,
or apparently suspended in warm light with no floor visible. One dancer
might be a two-dimensional shape against the glowing backdrop, while the
other dancer might be a three-dimensional figure against the encompassing
void. At one point Reitz walked on, wearing a straw hat; when she took it
off and held it centre-stage, a burning spotlight so illumined it that it
looked like a burning orb, a miniature sun.
The dance lasted over an hour, and towards the end some of Tipton's effects
became too virtuosic. Circles within circles of light, colours against
colours, darkness against brightness, until Reitz and even Rudner began to
seem incidental. The performance, however, was always enthralling - and
reminded me that when the history of American dance in our century is
written, the names of Tipton and Rudner should loom large in it.
The British attitude to space is, of course, a different matter. We do not
invade it, we occupy it discreetly, and what authority we exert in it is
terribly correct. Still, certain dancers and choreographers make movement in
space a matter of personal drama. Look at Siobhan Davies, whose company
(three women, three men) was dancing last weekend at the Queen Elizabeth
Hall.
Davies's style is lyrical, lambent, sensitive, discreet - frightfully
British. Again and again you see dancers stretching out into space - but
they do not step out into it, the American way. They hold their own, they
view the terrain, they express themselves. Nor does space here have any
character of the great unknown. Space with Davies, as with any British
choreographer, is something already charted. The drama of a dancer entering
space is simply the Virgina Woolf drama: staking out a room of one's own.
When one dancer partners another, there is no sense of conflict, or struggle
for power; but supportiveness galore.
Of the pieces Davies showed this weekend, Wanting to Tell Stories - which I
reviewed from Brighton this May - was having its London premiere, and was
the second half of both double-bills; the first half was either White Bird
Featherless or Make-Make, both of which have been seen here before. She is
fortunate in having the brilliant lighting of Peter Mumford, who achieves
marvels comparable to Tipton's - and, in White Bird Featherless, likewise
produces too many bravura effects.
Each of these Davies works has its own interesting character, but each is so
devoid of progress or climax that it is impossible to remain absorbed.
Davies is, no doubt, one of the most important British artists today, she
has made works I would love to see again (the most recent being the 1989
Sounding and the 1990 Different Trains), and her choreography is currently
reaching new peaks of stylistic sophistication. Yet how I wish the impulse
at their heart were simpler.
Everyone in a Davies work is endlessly sensitive, but to what end? Behind
all the lyricism, you begin to sense a kind of depressing passivity and an
artful love of contrivance. What a lot of subtle craft has gone into
creating this collage of people in their different ways - with all their
refinement of feelings and manners getting nowhere lyrically.
Curiously, a third Dance Umbrella event last weekend was also an affair of
light and the female choreographer. Miranda Tufnell was her own solo dancer,
and the lighting was by David Ward. The lighting - bulbs hanging low above
the floor, black-and-white patterns projected over the whole stage, and more
 -was an interesting enough stage environment. But Tufnell, never much of a
dancer, has become a slow, laborious bore. Mainly she rolled or lay slumped,
and sometimes she set the bulbs swinging through the air. The image her work
conveys is the most somnolent brand of solipsism.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Business and the Law: Tied up in claims for damages - US
lawyers are concerned at the growing trend to sue them when financial
institutions fail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a commercial currently running on US television that says a lot
about American public opinion of lawyers. The advertisement, for a
well-known brand of beer, features two good ol' boys in a bar fantasising
about a rodeo in which the cowboys rope lawyers instead of cattle - a bell
goes and out of the pen comes not a steer but Herman, a 17-stone tax
attorney.
In normal times you would expect American lawyers to laugh it off. But these
are not normal times for the US legal profession. Not only is the public
standing of lawyers at an all-time low, in recent years they have
increasingly found themselves the target of multi-million dollar legal
actions, following the failure of financial institutions to which they acted
as advisers.
To accountants, these actions have become all too familiar on both sides of
the Atlantic. This week in the UK, for example, the administrators of Polly
Peck, the failed fruit-to-electronics group, will issue a writ against the
company's auditor, Stoy Hayward, in an attempt to recover up to Pounds 370m
allegedly siphoned off by the fugitive former chairman, Mr Asil Nadir.
But for lawyers, being made the systematic target of actions for damages for
alleged professional negligence is a new experience.
Many of the claims against lawyers in the US have arisen out of the recent
savings and loans (building societies) crisis. Unable to recover much from
more than 700 savings and loans institutions and hundreds of banks which
have been closed by federal regulators over the last four years, federal
agencies and investors have looked increasingly to lawyers and accountants
as a source of compensatory damages.
Among the failed societies, Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan stands out as the source
of more claims against lawyers and accountants than any other institution.
Altogether, six law firms, partners of two other law firms and three leading
accounting firms faced claims based on their work for Lincoln and its
parent, American Continental Corp.
The failure of Lincoln prompted civil claims by bondholders of ACC and two
federal agencies, the Resolution Trust Corporation and the Office of Thrift
Supervision (OTS). So far Dollars 338m has been recovered from the
professional advisers - roughly Dollars 180m from the lawyers and Dollars
155m from the accountants.
According to Mr Harris Weinstein, of US lawyers Covington &amp; Burling, the
claims against the lawyers in the Lincoln case were similar to those in many
of the other cases growing out of the US savings and loan crisis.
There were allegations of conflict of interest, such as that lawyers had
inappropriately represented the parent, subsidiary and affiliate, when their
interests clearly differed. There were allegations that the lawyers
proceeded improperly in the face of evidence of intended illegal conduct by
the client. And there were allegations that lawyers ignored their knowledge
of the facts in writing legal opinions.
In addition, Mr Weinstein told the International Bar Association meeting in
New Orleans last week, the OTS actions against Kaye, Scholer and James
Fleischer underlined that lawyers can also be held responsible for a
client's failure to disclose information to its primary federal regulator.
Why, if all these allegations are true, are lawyers in general so worried
and complaining so loudly about the treatment of a handful of their
colleagues, whose professional behaviour appears to have been below the
required standard?
The lawyers' first concern is that the savings and loan litigation has
shifted the goalposts of attorney/client privilege.
In the action brought against law firm Jones, Day in Arizona, assertions by
the firm that it could not be held liable for merely advising its client
were rejected by Judge Bilby.
The line between maintaining a client's confidence and violating the federal
securities laws was clearer than Jones, Day thought. An attorney should
withdraw when he knows a client is engaged in a course of conduct designed
to deceive others, and where it is obvious that the attorney's compliant
legal advice may be a substantial factor in permitting the deception to
continue, the judge said.
But as lawyers point out, Judge Bilby's analysis of the correct course of
professional conduct assumes that a lawyer knows that a client is engaged in
deceit and that it is obvious that the attorney's advice will facilitate the
illegal scheme. In reality, however, it is often difficult for lawyers to
know when a client is engaged in fraud, and far from obvious that their
legal advice will facilitate the deception.
And how far should the lawyers go? Should they simply withdraw, or should
they inform the regulators when they suspect a client may be planning
something illegal?
Lawyers say such a change in the attorney/client relationship would
inevitably lead to defensive lawyering, rather as medical negligence actions
in the US have led to defensive medicine. Deals that would have been legal
will not be done. Shareholders who could have expected to profit from those
deals will suffer.
The second concern of the lawyers is shared by the accountants. It is that
the prospect of expensive awards of damages, coupled with the laws of joint
and several liability which allow any successful plaintiff to sue any one of
the defendants found to have acted wrongfully for the entire amount of the
judgment, will make it impossible to obtain sufficient professional
indemnity insurance cover.
If professionals continue to be seen by plaintiff's lawyers as 'deep
pockets' offering the best prospect of compensatory damages for their
clients, then some large law and accountancy firms could face ruin.
Fears along these lines were expressed in New Orleans by Mr Tim Lawrence,
the partner responsible for professional indemnity insurance arrangements
for accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand. Accountants inevitably made mistakes and
errors of judgment from time to time, he said. They could find themselves as
auditors of a company that turned out to have been run by crooks. But they
did not proceed on the assumption that everyone they were dealing with was
dishonest.
Yet, when in good faith they found they were inadvertently involved in a den
of thieves, they were often accused of fraud, gross negligence and of being
a Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organisation (RICO). He asked whether the
plaintiff's lawyers really believed that, or whether they were simply
prepared to adopt the legal device best calculated to maximise the damages
recoverable by their clients, and their own contingent fees.
Mr Lawrence also wondered where the morality lay in allowing claimants to
recover far more than they had lost. The concept of triple and punitive
damages in the US could leave shareholders in a failed company better off
than they might have been if the company had been successful.
And where was the fairness in the laws of joint and several liability that
allowed Coopers recently to find itself the primary target for a claim
where, he said, on any concept of equity, no one could have attributed more
than 10 per cent of the fault to the accountants.
Mr Lawrence called for urgent reform of the law of joint and several
liability so that the amount a professional person had to bear had some
relation to his or her proportionate responsibility for the loss suffered.
Already it was impossible to insure a big accounting firm for a sum adequate
to cover the risks it faced, he said. If something was not done, 'people of
the right quality will no longer be prepared to attempt the task of auditing
the financial statements of any company with less than an AAA (credit)
rating. The crooks will then have unfettered opportunity to bamboozle the
third-rate auditors that remain.'
It is difficult to judge the significance of the current claims for damages
facing accountants and lawyers in the US. Some believe that it is a
temporary phenomenon. Mr A A Sommer, a partner of US law firm Morgan Lewis &amp;
Bockius and former commissioner at the Securities and Exchange Commission,
believes lawyers' present problem is tied to the savings and loans crisis,
and that it is just a one-off matter.
Others disagree, however. Mr Mel Weiss, a New York plaintiff's attorney,
believes it is right to target professionals who fail in their professional
duty. And he also warned that what America had experienced today the rest of
the world would experience tomorrow. 'You're going to see what we have here
exported internationally,' he predicted.
Soon it might not be only American lawyers being roped in television
advertisements.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Business and the Law: Farm traders slip on butter oil case -
European Law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRICK COURT CHAMBERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court of Justice has confirmed that agricultural traders cannot
escape the commercial risks inherent in exporting to command economies such
as the former Soviet Union.
The ECJ made its ruling in answer to questions raised by the English
Commercial Court in the course of proceedings brought by An Bord Baine and
Inter-Agra against the Intervention Board for Agricultural Produce.
Inter-Agra had contracted to sell 15,000 tonnes of butter oil to Prodintorg,
a trading organisation in the former Soviet Union. It was a condition of the
contract that the butter oil conformed with the Soviet standards applicable
to butter for conversion into butter oil.
An Bord Baine, in turn, had contracted with Inter-Agra to supply butter for
export to Prodintorg and to lodge the tendering security required by EC
rules. Accordingly, it successfully tendered for 11,000 tonnes of salted
butter held by the Intervention Board for Agricultural Produce.
Its tender was accompanied by a written undertaking that the butter would be
exported to the USSR after being processed into butter oil. At that time the
butter satisfied Soviet standards which had been in force for 30 years.
However, the Soviet authorities changed the quality requirements for
imported butter oil. It was impossible for acceptable butter oil to be
produced from the butter which had been the subject of the tender. The
change in quality requirements was not published or communicated to the
tender party or intending exporter.
The ECJ held that the concept of force majeure must be interpreted by
reference to the legal context in question as it does not have the same
scope in the different fields of Community law.
In the context of EC agricultural regulations, the nature of the public-law
relationships between traders and the national administration, as well as
the aims of the regulations in question, must be taken into account.
Accordingly, the ECJ confirmed previous rulings that the concept of force
majeure was not limited to absolute impossibility but had to be understood
in the sense of abnormal and unforeseeable circumstances, outside the
control of the trader concerned; the consequences of this, in spite of the
exercise of all due care, could not have been avoided except at the cost of
excessive sacrifice.
The ECJ said that although the amendment of Soviet law was a circumstance
outside the control of the trader concerned, it constituted a usual
commercial risk in commercial transactions with an organisation of a command
economy. It was not an abnormal and unforeseeable event. A prudent trader
could take precautions.
C-124/92: An Bord Baine Co-operative Ltd and Compagnie Inter-Agra SA v
Intervention Board for Agricultural Produce, ECJ 6CH, 13 October 1993.
Japanese distribution companies and dumping calculations
The ECJ has rejected an attempt to overturn its previous approval of the
European Commission's approach to calculating the domestic selling price of
Japanese companies which distribute their products in Japan through local
sales subsidiaries.
The ECJ has confirmed that the Commission is right to use the sale price
charged by the subsidiary to the first independent customer rather than the
price at which the sales companies buy from the manufacturing division since
they belong to the same corporation.
Matsushita challenged the 26.3 per cent definitive anti-dumping duty imposed
since January 1990 by the EC on exports of its CD players from Japan. It
argued that the sales from its manufacturing division to its sales
subsidiaries were sales in the ordinary course of trade and should be used
by the Commission for the purpose of determining if dumping existed.
The ECJ agreed with the Commission that the only sales in the ordinary
course of trade were the sales by the subsidiaries since they formed a
single economic unit with the rest of the Matsushita group.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Chambers urge aid for industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT should take a more interventionist role in manufacturing
industry, Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, the largest chamber in Britain,
said yesterday.
The chamber said the government should offer tax breaks to investors,
low-cost finance for new companies and enhanced credit guarantees for
exporters.
It said that without such state aid the weakness of Britain's manufacturing
sector would impede export-led growth.
The document, setting out the long-term needs of Britain's 'industrial
heartlands', precedes a national survey this week by the British Chambers of
Commerce which is expected to show that many companies doubt that the
recovery can be sustained while the recession in continental Europe worsens.
Although the survey is also understood to show a significant upturn in
domestic demand in the past quarter, the Birmingham Chamber fears this is
mainly through growing demand for services rather than manufacturing.
Mr Tony Bradley, head of policy at the Birmingham chamber, said: 'In the
absence of a strong manufacturing sector, a domestic recovery led by
consumers and services will only reproduce the inflationary boom-bust cycle
and will not lay the foundations for sustainable medium-term growth.'
To offset the structural faults in the economy, the chamber advocates:
Abolition of capital gains tax for investors who retain their shares in
companies for more than five years.
New financial support for exporters through export credit guarantees.
An extension of tax relief on training expenditure.
A reduction in 'regulatory burdens imposed on industry'.
'More flexible and responsive financing packages' for small and medium-sized
companies.
Mr Bradley said almost 30 per cent of manufacturing companies in the
Midlands had shed jobs in the past year and 30 per cent expected to make
further cuts.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Allan Gormly, chief executive of Trafalgar House, is to take over from Sir
John Cuckney as chairman of Royal Insurance. Sir John, who will retire in
August 1994 after nine years as chairman, first teamed up with Gormly in the
early 1980s when the two were chairman and chief executive respectively of
John Brown, the construction company. Gormly, 55, a chartered accountant, is
described by Royal insiders as a 'nuts and bolts industrialist with an
in-depth knowledge of international trading operations'. His appointment
reflects intentions to meld insurance expertise with broader industrial and
managerial skills. Gormly will give up his post as chief executive of TH but
will remain on the board as a non-executive director.

FT  19 OCT 93 / People: McKinnon's new job
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir James McKinnon, former director-general of the gas industry watchdog
Ofgas, has become chairman of Ionica, the Cambridge-based telecommunications
company.
The appointment is a coup for Ionica, which is building a national telecoms
network to rival BT and Mercury, using radio technology. Ionica is looking
to McKinnon to give some edge to its strategic planning. Fresh from his
battles to breathe competitive air into the gas market, McKinnon says he is
'keenly interested to participate in the growth of competition in other
markets'.
In telecoms, competition is growing so quickly that Ionica may have
difficulty finding a niche. Despite its confidence that fixed radio links
will offer a cheaper means of communication than cable or cellular systems,
the company is more than a year away from offering a service, and it will
come on stream only after a third national operator - Energis - has been
launched on to the UK's telecoms market. Meanwhile, at the local level,
cable companies - mostly US-owned - are rapidly seducing customers from BT
with all-in telephone/cable TV packages.
At any rate, McKinnon could not hope for a broader-based company. Its
shareholders include Yorkshire Electricity, Telecom Finland, Robert Fleming
Investment Trust and Kingston Communications, the Hull telephone company.

FT  19 OCT 93 / People: Laird takes a seat on the bus
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gavin Laird, the canny general secretary of the AEEU engineering and
electrical union, is extending his interests to buses.
Laird has been appointed a non-executive director of the company being
formed by bus workers to acquire a part of the biggest of the seven English
metropolitan passenger transport companies. The splitting and sale of GM
Buses into two businesses, each of which is to be sold, is one of the
biggest bus privatisations attempted so far.
Laird, who is leading the bid for GM Buses North, says that trade unionists
and employees would prefer the service to remain in public ownership. But,
if privatisation were forced upon them, then employees would rather be the
new owners.
Each of the employees involved in making the bid is committing a minimum of
Pounds 1,000. Laird says that if the bid is successful the company would be
driven by one primary objective: to provide the travelling public of Greater
Manchester 'with an efficient cost-effective service second to none'.
Alan Westwell, GM Buses chief executive and managing director who has worked
together with union representatives as a team in formulating the bid says he
is 'delighted to have Gavin on board. His credibility, support and guidance
gives us enormous strength'. If the bid is successful, Westwell would become
md of GM Buses North and Laird chairman.

Small firms, with their limited financial and managerial resources, are
sensitive to this detail and keen to influence its drafting. The
organisations representing them have therefore jumped at the opportunity of
two Budgets in one year to put their case.
At this stage in the UK's halting recovery from recession, the legislation
which affects the ability of small firms to raise finance have taken on a
particular prominence. With the banks still nursing sizeable losses on their
small-business investments and the venture capital industry facing its own
cash shortage, alternative sources of finance are important.
The main areas of concern for the business lobbyists are:
A replacement for the Business Expansion Scheme which will be wound up at
the end of this year. For all its limitations, the BES channelled additional
equity finance to small businesses and they are keen to find an alternative.
As the Confederation of British Industry points out, the tax system treats
equity investment in unquoted companies less favourably than other
investments. It suggests two alternatives; up-front tax relief for personal
income invested in business assets on the lines of relief applied to private
pension scheme contributions; or relief on the returns from direct
investment in a business in the same way as dividends and capital gains from
shares included in a personal equity plan (PEP). These reliefs would only be
available on investments in unquoted companies with shareholders' funds of
less than Pounds 2m.
An alternative suggestion from the British Venture Capital Association is
for a broadening of the scope of PEP tax reliefs to include investments in
unquoted companies. Since the sums required would be considerably larger
than the amounts at present covered by PEP relief, individuals should be
eligible for relief on amounts of up to Pounds 50,000 a year. Companies
specialising in asset growth and involved in areas such as property and
wines would be excluded.
The cost of raising equity finance. At present companies may claim tax
relief on the costs associated with raising debt finance but not on the
costs of issuing equity. Extending relief to equity would be useful for the
small company planning a stock market flotation, suggests the City Group for
Smaller Companies. Cisco was set up to find a replacement for the Unlisted
Securities Market, which is threatened with closure. The idea of relief for
the cost of raising equity has also won the support of the Institute of
Directors.
Capital gains tax. The equalisation of capital gains tax and the top rate of
income tax at 40 per cent have given an added importance to a tax which has
always loomed large for the entrepreneur. Calls for the complete exemption
of capital gains from tax have come from the British Chambers of Commerce,
which want a five-year cut-off, and the British Venture Capital Association,
which seeks a two-year deadline.
The Federation of Small Businesses wants flexibility in the treatment of
capital losses and gains while the Institute of Directors wants businesses
to be able to carry losses back for three years. Unused exemptions should be
eligible to be carried forward without time limit.
A further easing of the rollover relief introduced in the March budget is
sought by Cisco and the CBI. Cisco wants relief to be extended to gains
which are reinvested in small quoted companies (as well as unquoted
businesses) while the CBI wants relief extended to capital gains made from
any source, provided they are reinvested in unquoted companies.
Value added tax. In theory VAT should be a neutral tax for everyone in
business until the goods reach the final consumer. In practice, businesses
have been hit by the traditional method of settling VAT, requiring the tax
to be paid regardless of whether the client has paid his bill. This system
penalises the supplier and gives an unfair cash flow advantage to the slow
payer, claims the Federation of Small Businesses.
The federation and British Chambers of Commerce want an extension of cash
accounting, which does not require VAT to be settled until the customer has
made payment. Smaller companies may already opt for cash accounting but the
federation wants all VAT payments to be made on a cash basis. The chambers
want the size of a company eligible to cash account raised from Pounds
350,000 of sales to Pounds 2m.
Capital allowances. The era of 100 per cent first-year allowances, abolished
by the government in 1984, is now a memory, but some of the lobbyists hope
for a return to a more generous regime.
Hoping to take advantage of the temporary easing of the allowances regime in
1992, the CBI and the chambers of commerce are calling for further
concessions. The CBI wants companies to be able to write off up to Pounds
200,000 of spending on plant and machinery in the first year or 40 per cent
of their total spend, whichever is the greater. The chambers want the 40 per
cent first-year allowance extended to the hard-hit retailing sector.
The size of the Budget deficit means Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth
Clarke has little room for manoeuvre. Small firms believe some concessions
are needed if they are to play a full part in the recovery.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Keeping the customer
happy - Companies that put the client first have much to gain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dee Swift recalls the customer who towed his caravan into the company car
park and scratched two cars while parking. When asked about the incident,
the customer said that if a member of the company's staff had parked his
caravan for him then he would not have got into difficulties.
Some might have regarded this response as bare-faced cheek. Swift, marketing
manager of Harringtons Caravan &amp; Leisure World, took it as a compliment to
her company's policy of customer care.
Even if raising people's expectations can sometimes rebound, Swift believes
that going out of your way to treat your customers well pays off.
Harringtons, a family-owned business based in the Delamere Forest, Cheshire,
has expanded and remained profitable throughout the recession. It made sales
of Pounds 9.1m in 1992/93 and expects a further Pounds 1m increase in the
current year.
According to the business text books it should be no surprise that a small
firm takes good care of its customers. In theory the small business is
closer to its customer than the large company, is very service-conscious and
innovative, comments David Kirby, professor of entrepreneurship at Durham
University Business School.
'In reality, though, this is not always the case,' he told a London Chamber
of Commerce seminar last week. Small businesses can be just as remote from
their customers as large.
Among the attributes of the 'winning company' identified by the US
management guru Tom Peters are: a willingness to flatter its customers; a
consciousness of the importance of service and a high degree of
responsiveness to what the market wants.
Customer service can start with the obvious. Michael Pritchard, owner and
managing director of the Spar Foodliner, a supermarket in Treherbert, a
village in the Rhondda Valley in south Wales, puts a great deal of effort
into reducing the waiting time at his check-outs.
Pritchard claims an average waiting time of 2 1/2 to three minutes and a
maximum of five minutes, compared with much longer delays at his larger
rivals. Staff are switched from refilling shelves to the check-outs when
queues start to build up.
Pritchard says he puts an emphasis on customer service because his is a
small supermarket in competition with much larger stores owned by the big
chains. The Spar Foodliner has a turnover of Pounds 1.6m and employs 28
people.
But the innovative business owner can take customer care to considerable
lengths. Pritchard runs a bus service up the valley every Wednesday to bring
in customers without cars. This was an idea borrowed from the larger
supermarket chains but Pritchard's service for handicapped customers is
probably unique.
Not only is the store designed to allow wheelchair access, Pritchard's staff
will make up orders for disabled customers and accompany them round the
aisles if necessary. Some other local stores positively discourage the
handicapped, says Pritchard.
Harringtons Caravan puts a lot of effort into fostering long-term
relationships with its customers. It offers a free replacement caravan for
up to four weeks if a customer's caravan is damaged in an accident, an
instructional video with every caravan purchase and a 24-hour telephone
helpline. Caravan interest afternoons are held on the last Wednesday of each
month, attracting up to 100 people, while a newsletter goes out three times
a year to 20,000 people on its mailing list.
But the all-important first impression that a customer receives will depend
on how he or she is treated by the staff. Harringtons Caravan expects its
110 employees, from managing director to caravan cleaner, to greet customers
with a smile and a 'good morning' or 'good afternoon'.
John Maddison, owner of a garden centre in Chester-le-Street, County Durham,
until he sold it last November, says he insisted on an 'eyes up' policy.
Staff weeding beds or sweeping the floor were required to look up and greet
customers.
But ensuring your staff make customers feel welcome is only the outward
manifestation of an approach that must be grounded in a well thought out
policy on customer care. This should start with research, or at least
observation, of what customers want.
Harringtons Caravan set up its own subsidiary to carry out research into its
sector of the market in 1985. The company now holds regular lunchtime
meetings with small groups of customers to ask them their views of the
company and the caravan industry. But a weakness of this method is that
people are reluctant to be critical.
Maddison used a variety of approaches to stay close to his customers,
including surveys carried out by business school students. But he also
practised 'management by drinking cups of coffee'. Selected customers would
be offered a voucher guaranteeing a free cup of coffee in the garden
centre's coffee bar. Maddison would then chat to them while they relaxed.
Establishing an effective policy on customer care requires a professional
approach to training and motivating staff. Maddison says he always made sure
that his most junior employee - the boy or girl sweeping the floor and hence
the person most likely to be asked by customers - knew from day one where
the check-out, the coffee bar and the toilets were.
Harringtons Caravan trains its staff on the technical aspects of caravans
but also puts a lot of effort into career appraisals, seminars and an annual
'think tank' for each department to discuss ideas.
Training people to be welcoming and friendly is difficult and companies
depend more on recruiting the right sort of people at the outset.
Spar Foodliner has a low turnover of staff which means they can be 'brought
into the family way of doing business', says Pritchard.
The benefits of these efforts should come in loyal customers who, over the
years, will spend large sums with the company. Existing customers are far
easier and cheaper to reach than new ones while satisfied customers will
promote a company for free. Dissatisfied customers, in contrast, talk to far
more people.
But what does it cost? Many small companies appear vague about the cost of
their customer care programmes, although Pritchard accepts that his policies
mean his staff achieve a lower productivity than the larger supermarket
chains. Training is also expensive, but is essential in many businesses for
reasons other than customer care.
Building a reputation for customer care takes time and commitment. 'Customer
care is not just a gloss,' says Kirby. 'It goes right to the heart of the
business.' It can also provide an invaluable edge in increasingly
competitive markets.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Technology: Long on vision, short on substance - Technically
Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japan Electronics Show, which has just taken place in the appropriately
futuristic surroundings of Makuhari Messe, the exhibition centre on the
outskirts of Tokyo, should have been a perfect occasion for Japan's consumer
electronics makers to let the world know that despite taking a beating for
the past three and a half years, they are back on their feet.
Instead, the show seemed to confirm suspicions that the industry is still
some way away from living up to its vision of a grand new world of
electronics that would add an extra dimension to the role these gadgets play
in our everyday lives.
It is true that Sony was there with its flashy new MiniDisc players in all
shapes and sizes, competing for attention with various models of digital
compact cassette player.
Matsushita proudly displayed a TV set that is much thinner than conventional
sets, while Pioneer sought to take karaoke entertainment to new heights.
But when it came to bright ideas for innovative uses of electronics, the
show was long on vision but still somewhat short on substance.
Take three-dimensional displays, for example - one of the features of the
show which attracted long queues. Sanyo and Toshiba both displayed
three-dimensional, high-definition projection systems.
The attraction of three-dimensional film should be irresistible, given that
the industry has tried to develop this since the 1950s.
Technically, even the Sanyo system, which requires special glasses, provides
fairly impressive three-dimensional video. Sanyo has also developed a system
with NHK, the public broadcasting corporation, which does not require
glasses, although it would require special broadcasts.
Sanyo says its system still needs work, but it would like to develop a
system for home entertainment. Toshiba explains that as soon as 2000, TV
viewers could be watching three-dimensional programmes either in packaged
form or on one of the substantial number of satellite channels that are
expected to be operating by then.
The question is, given the failure of high-definition TV to take off in its
current form, is there room, even 10 years from now, for another
entertainment format that would require special programmes to be produced
for broadcasts or video?
Another promising highlight of the show was digital video, which takes
visual media into the digital age. Here, the immediate benefits are more
obvious, in that digital video will allow films and entertainment footage to
be recorded on an easy-to-use compact disc that allows random access. But
again, video disc requires the creation of a new library of entertainment
software which competes with the countless video footage that already
exists, not only in the studios but in video rental shops worldwide.
The Electronics Show was also an occasion for companies to exhibit their
personal computing and communicating tools, from Sharp's Expert Pad Personal
Digital Assistant, which was co-developed with Apple Computer, to Toshiba's
Personal Information Tool, XTEND.
As far as these much-heralded personal devices go, the technology has some
way to develop. Neither Sharp's nor Toshiba's handy gadgets on display were
very good at recognising handwriting. Unless these tools can do more than
replace a personal organiser, it would be hard to justify the considerable
trouble of learning how to use them.
The Electronics Show left the impression of an industry with bright ideas
but still needing to do a lot of work in making those ideas a reality for
the consumer.
Without the right software available, not only to the technically attuned
but to the ordinary consumer, and without the necessary infrastructure in
place to deliver that software, it is difficult to escape an uneasy feeling
that the message has been left behind by the messenger.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Technology: New office suite
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOF WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Today's introduction of a new version of Microsoft's 'all-in-one' suite of
business applications, Microsoft Office, reflects a significant shift in the
sale and use of personal computer software.
Microsoft Office combines the US company's popular Microsoft Word for
Windows word processor, Excel spreadsheet, PowerPoint business presentation
graphics system and Mail electronic mail software in one package. The Office
package will include improved versions of these applications and offer more
'integration' features that allow information to be moved between
applications.
Microsoft Office is a new approach to selling PC applications in 'suites'.
Similarly, Lotus Development offers SmartSuite - combining its Lotus 1-2-3
spreadsheet, Ami Pro word-processor, Freelance Graphics business
presentation program and cc:Mail electronic mail software. Borland
International offers a Borland Office package, including Borland's Quattro
Pro spreadsheet and its Paradox database and WordPerfect's WordPerfect for
Windows.
For users, these 'office' products are a way to buy a set of applications
for up to a quarter of the cost of buying individual applications packages.
However, there are also other benefits. Microsoft Office users can use a
function from one application while working in another.
Users can also benefit from the increasingly consistent design of
applications incorporated in suites. Menu items are largely common across
all the applications in a single office suite. The popularity of these
'suites' of programs is growing. Microsoft makes more than half its US
applications sales in the form of Microsoft Office (for the Apple Macintosh
and Microsoft Windows). In the UK, Microsoft Office accounts for about 70
per cent of its applications revenues.
For manufacturers, office-suite products may mean slower revenue growth but
they can boost sales of parts of the suite that might not otherwise be as
successful - while tying users to a single software company's vision of how
applications should work together.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Technology: Going the whole hog - Britain's pig breeders
have created a lean animal which is the envy of the world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The humble bacon rasher may not look like a hi-tech industrial product, but
the drive to provide the consumer with leaner cuts of pork has spawned a
highly sophisticated pig-breeding technology in which Britain leads the
world.
Today's pigs are no longer the fatty cinderellas of the meat business, but
are as lean as chickens. They are quicker to grow than their ancestors and
produce more piglets. Future generations could be made resistant to many
fatal diseases at birth by manipulating their genes in vitro.
Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, recently praised Britain's pig
breeders for 'revolutionising' the kind of animal produced in response to
consumer demand.
'In the past 20 years, we've reduced the backfat levels on our pigs by half
and improved the feed conversion rate by 30 per cent,' says Stephen Curtis,
managing director for production at the National Pig Development Company.
The feed conversion rate is the efficiency with which a pig converts its
food intake into weight gain.
'The UK is a forerunner in all aspects of pig technology worldwide and we're
seen as a source of the most advanced genetic breeding stock,' says Tony
Walker, senior pig consultant at Adas, the government's farm advisory
service.
Leading pig breeding companies in the UK export their animals across the
globe and five companies have developed links with leading breeders in the
large US market in recent years.
NPD and other pig breeders have produced a generation of svelte pigs by
using rigorous systems of cross-breeding where only top animals are selected
for reproduction. The process is monitored and recorded on computer,
creating a database of pig information stretching across the generations.
This information not only helps to create leaner pigs, but also improves
farmers' profit margins since they can cut food supplies as hybrid pigs
become more efficient at gaining weight. In a further attempt to improve
margins, breeders have also been looking at increasing the number of piglets
born to sows each year.
NPD hit the headlines a year ago with the launch of a new hybrid, the Manor
Meishan pig. The pure-bred Meishan - a phenomenally ugly breed of Chinese
pig - has strong motherly instincts, producing more piglets than its western
counterparts with more teats and milk, nurturing them well to maturity. But
its meat is extremely fatty.
When crossed with NPD's sleeker, slimmer offspring, it produces a lean pig.
Dubbed the 'aristocrat of pigs' by American buyers, the Manor Meishan
produces 14 piglets per litter compared with 11 to 12 for a conventional
British breed.
NPD carefully records the number of piglets born to each mother. It
incorporates this information, along with data on weight gain and muscle
formation, into an index setting estimated breeding values for each pig.
This index is used to rank each pig so that only the top five to 20 per cent
are used for breeding.
More than 22,000 pigs are tested by NPD every year - the company records
their weight gain over 50 days and measures their muscle growth with
ultrasonic scanners.
The plethora of information on every pig that passes through NPD's units
extends to breeding animals that are sent overseas. In this way, the UK
management can advise franchisees as far afield as the Philippines and South
Africa on which pigs to use for breeding.
The technological monitoring process is accompanied by traditional stockman
skills where farmers assess the strength of a pig's legs, for example. 'I
can see all the figures on screen and say 'that pig grows wonderfully', but
the quality controller might point out that its legs are too fragile,' says
Sam Hoste, NPD's geneticist.
NPD is trying to institutionalise the stockman's intuition by asking them to
give a score to the pigs' physical attributes such as strong legs. These can
be recorded on computer and incorporated into the ranking process.
One way of stepping up the monitoring process is with a new system of
electronic ear tags which NPD is considering introducing this year. These
register a pig's number on the computer when it passes through weighing
scales. Farmers can pick up the pig's number with an electronic wand,
tapping additional information on that pig into a hand-held computer. These
details can follow the animal through the slaughterhouse to the supermarket
shelf, allowing the consumer access to a variety of information about the
way the pig was raised.
Pig breeders are also taking their first steps into the science fiction
world of molecular genetics, with DNA testing for stress genes that can
cause pigs to die young. EC pig breeders are supporting a project to plot a
map of the pig's genes. UK companies have also started a joint initiative to
sponsor research into how the information on genes can be applied - for
example, they want to isolate the series of genes responsible for
reproduction.
This will allow breeders to increase litter size - Curtis says he has bred a
Meishan superpig capable of producing 40 piglets a year, against a national
average of roughly 21. 'It would take us about 10 years to get to a point
where we are producing 40 pigs a year at a commercial level, but with gene
mapping we can probably do it in three,' he says.
But this development may be delayed by pressure from animal welfare groups
for less intensive farming methods. While consumers are eager to eat more
lean meat, they want to be sure it comes from a happy pig.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Drive on benefits 'saved Pounds 558m'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER LILLEY, social security secretary, told the Commons yesterday that
record 'fraud savings' of Pounds 558m were made last year.
Mr Lilley said the Benefits Agency caught more than 270,000 people
'cheating' the social security system. He suggested that doctors would be
likely to welcome new procedures to determine eligibility for invalidity
benefit.
Replying to protests by Labour MPs, Mr Lilley said he had never criticised
doctors for the rapid growth in the numbers being paid invalidity benefit.
During the past 15 years the number of claimants had nearly trebled, while
the expenditure involved had more than trebled in real terms.
Dr Charles Goodson-Wickes, Conservative MP for Wimbledon, said the system
was perceived by many to be subject to abuse.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Defiant Names claim prospect of victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REPRESENTATIVES of loss-making Names plan to meet Mr David Rowland, chairman
of Lloyd's, this afternoon, as they press for compensation before tomorrow's
crucial vote on the issue of admission of corporate investors to the
insurance market.
Members of the Lloyd's Names Associations Working Party, which links 37
action groups, hold proxy votes on behalf of their members.
They believe they may be able to win the vote at the extraordinary general
meeting and could attempt to block moves to invite corporate capital if
Lloyd's refuses to offer acceptable compensation for their insurance losses.
'We certainly have enough votes to force some issues,' said Mr Christopher
Stockwell, chairman of the working party.
At a meeting yesterday representatives of the loss-making Names also
discussed calling for an adjournment of Wednesday's vote to allow time for
settlement negotiations to take place.
'There is no doubt that a settlement is the real issue,' said Mr Stockwell.
'The council have got the cart before the horse.'
Meanwhile, a separate group of loss-making Names are threatening to
repudiate their contracts and sue Lloyd's for fraud if the insurance market
draws down on their deposits to meet losses.
The Lloyd's Action Group for Restitution and Deposit Defence alleges that
Names - the individuals whose assets support the market - have been victims
of 'false accounting' and a 'false market (that) has existed within Lloyd's
since as long ago as 1981 and perhaps earlier'.
The action group has collected Pounds 75,000 from about 300 Names so far but
hopes to persuade more to join it and to help finance its action.
Mr Clive Francis, chairman of the group, said its aim was to ensure that
5,000 loss-makers 'do not get left behind' as the market seeks new corporate
investors.
The group claims to have 'astonishing evidence' and was 'absolutely certain
of its case'.
The action group's solicitors have written to the chairman and corporation
of Lloyd's detailing their instructions to file writs in the commercial
court 'which should shortly be served on you, seeking, amongst other things,
an order preventing you from further drawing down on Names'.
The letter invites Lloyd's by October 21 'to agree and undertake not to draw
down further on Names until the issues relating to criminal conspiracy,
fraud and the creation of a false market within Lloyd's have been
determined'.
Mr Francis has lost Pounds 2.1m.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Rail fares to rise around 6 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FARES on London Transport, Scotrail and Network SouthEast are to rise by an
average of 6 per cent from next January, it was announced yesterday, Rachel
Johnson writes.
Travelcards, which offer unlimited use of London Tube and bus services for
daily, weekly and longer periods, are to rise by an average of 7.7 per cent.
The projected revenue from fare increases on London Transport is expected to
amount to Pounds 52m more than total fare revenue in 1993.
Fares on most InterCity routes, however, have been frozen. The operator took
the 'strategic decision' to respond to continuing sluggish demand with a
fares freeze.
The rises outstrip the present rate of retail price inflation by up to four
times. But they are much lower than was suggested in documents leaked during
the summer. These indicated that London fares were to rise by up to 16 per
cent.
Network SouthEast has to make up a Pounds 230m shortfall to meet financial
targets next year. It warned yesterday that the 6 per cent average increase
would not be enough to stave off a deterioration in service levels.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Backbenchers make muted protest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EXPECTED pre-emptive strike against the threat of further defence cuts
was duly launched from the Tory back benches when the two-day defence debate
began in the Commons yesterday. But it was more muted than it had been
billed.
This was not surprising. For one thing, the villain of the piece - namely Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor - had sensibly beaten a tactical retreat to
the Treasury for the day.
For another, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, was unable to refer
directly to the state of his negotiations with the cabinet's EDX committee
about the size of his future budget. By giving way to other MPs with unusual
alacrity, however, Mr Rifkind did ensure that as many as possible of his
Tory colleagues who were opposed to further cuts had their say.
Mr Winston Churchill, MP for Davyhulme, called for the Pounds 80bn social
security budget to be cut rather than defence. Conservatives had
traditionally regarded their 'prime raison d'etre' as the defence of the
realm, he said.
Mr Cyril Townsend, MP for Bexleyheath, said it would be 'fatal' to chop a
further Pounds 1bn from the defence budget, as the Treasury is said to be
considering. He was supported by Mr Patrick Cormack, MP for Staffordshire
South, who urged Mr Rifkind to resist 'fatuous' proposals such as those for
an arbitrary Pounds 1bn cut.
Sir Geoffrey Johnson-Smith, a leading member of the Conservative backbench
defence committee, asked for an assurance that moves to deploy reserve
forces more widely would not be used as an 'excuse' for lowering the quality
of training and equipment given to regular forces.
Mr Archie Hamilton, the former armed forces minister, called for other
departments which used British troops, such as the Foreign Office and the
Northern Ireland Office, to be asked to pay for them.
Sir Geoffrey Pattie, MP for Chertsey and Walton and non-executive chairman
of GEC-Marconi, backed calls for a full defence review. He said that, if the
government believed the UK to be no longer capable of sustaining a
'Falklands-type operation on our own', the British people should be told.
The first threat of a revolt by Tory backbenchers came from Sir Jerry
Wiggin, MP for Weston-super-Mare and a former defence minister.
He warned that savage and serious cuts in defence would be questioned by
some Tory backbenchers 'very strongly, and probably in the lobby'. For
Labour, Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, accused ministers of
'rushing through' the debate because they knew Mr Clarke would announce
further cuts in next month's Budget.
Mr Clark said a Labour government would keep the Trident missile programme
in spite of a vote to scrap it at the party's annual conference in Brighton
earlier this month.

THE government was defeated in the Lords last night over the introduction of
new farming quota payments.
A motion from Lord Hamilton of Dalzell (Conservative) strongly criticising
the new regime for sheep and suckler cow farming, was approved by 69 votes
to 52. But the government, which is expected to ignore the vote, insisted
that what the Lords wanted was illegal.
The new quotas, which took effect in July, were strongly critised by
landowning peers, who said they would lower land values and harm tenants in
poorer agricultural areas.
Earl Howe, junior agriculture minister, insisted that the government had
done everything it legally could to protect tenants and landowners from the
EC quota regime.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Tory rebels warn on rail privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSERVATIVE rebels against rail privatisation yesterday warned the
government not to try to reverse a Lords amendment giving British Rail more
power to bid for new franchises.
Ministers are considering how to respond to the threat of a backbench
rebellion when the bill returns to the Commons by early November.
They fear that up to 15 backbenchers may vote against an attempt to overrule
the upper chamber's amendment allowing BR to bid for rail franchises after
privatisation.
Mr Gary Waller, MP for Keighley, said: 'Many people up and down the country
do not believe that a change to the franchises would result in a better rail
service.' He is hoping ministers will accept the Lord's amendment.
Mr Richard Shepherd, MP for Aldridge Brownhills, said: 'My advice to the
government is that they should accept the Lords' amendment.'
Sir Teddy Taylor, MP for Southend East, said there was an easy solution to
the problem: 'If the government does not want BR to bid for the franchises
it should widen that out and prevent any national rail corporation from
bidding.'
However, since such a blanket ban on foreign railways could be in breach of
a European Commission directive, the government is unlikely to agree to such
a proposal.
Pressure from backbenchers has taken on a greater significance since the
Ulster Unionists signalled that the government would have to work hard to
secure their help in steering its rail privatisation proposals through the
Commons.
A number of Tory MPs said they had asked ministers to find a compromise. 'I
am hopeful that the government will not try to reverse the Lords amendment,'
said one senior backbencher. Another said: 'I don't think you should assume
the government will automatically try to push through its original rail
privatisation proposals.'
Ms Emma Nicholson, MP for Devon West, said that while she would not vote
against the government, she hoped ministers would come up with 'better
proposals' on privatisation.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, and Mr Roger Freeman, transport
minister, are holding meetings with many of the Tory MPs concerned that BR
should be able to bid against the private sector for franchises.
Some backbenchers are concerned about what they believe to be inadequate
government funding for BR. Mr Peter Bottomley, a former transport minister,
said the lack of capital investment was more important than BR's future
ownership.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Handling of fraud cases for review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A REVIEW of the handling of fraud prosecutions by the Serious Fraud Office
and the Crown Prosecution Service was announced yesterday by Sir Nicholas
Lyell, the attorney-general.
It will examine the distribution of case work between the two agencies which
between them are currently responsible for bringing the overwhelming
majority of fraud cases before the courts.
Sir Nicholas tacitly acknowledged the severe embarrassment recently suffered
by the prosecuting authorities through the collapse of indictments involving
substantial sums and prominent defendants.
The review has been prompted by the recommendation of the recent Royal
Commission on Criminal Justice that a feasibility study into merging the two
agencies should be carried out.
It was made against a background of continuing concern over both the way
prosecutions are brought and the differences in the powers enjoyed by the
SFO and the Fraud Investigation Group (FIG) within the CPS.
Only the SFO has the section 2 powers to remove the right to silence and
compel suspects to answer questions. It also assumes the role of
investigator far earlier than FIG, which relies more upon the police to
carry out initial investigations.
These differences in powers have attracted criticism in legal circles since
the only differences in the offences investigated by the two agencies are
the amounts of money involved in the fraud. The SFO only takes cases
involving at least Pounds 5m. Those involving smaller sums are handled by
FIG.
The attorney-general, in a Commons written reply, said the review will look
at the distribution of case work between the two agencies, the way
differences in their powers affect the handling of cases and the powers of
the SFO.
Sir Nicholas said it would also cover the organisation and management of
investigation and prosecution work, taking into account the role of the
police in fraud investigations and the Department of Trade and Industry in
company matters generally.
Official sources stressed last night that there was no hidden agenda behind
the review and that no decisions had been taken at this point on issues such
as extending the section 2 powers of the SFO to FIG.
However, the section 2 powers are credited by the SFO and others as having
proved to be a successful means of persuading an increasing number of
suspects to plead guilty before a trial, a trend which has boosted the SFO's
conviction rate.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Employers criticised on training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY yesterday criticised the 'astonishing failure' of
many employers to check the value of the staff training that they pay for.
According to the society's quarterly survey, employers spend an average of
Pounds 492 per head on training, with each employee spending a total of just
over four days a year being trained.
However, only 36 per cent of personnel directors questioned said their
organisation defined objectives for each training and development programme
before the programme began. The survey covered about one-third of the
society's 12,000 member organisations.
The majority simply did not know if objectives were fixed, indicating, said
the society, that if such a policy existed it was unlikely to be properly
carried out.
With the exception of questionnaires, most organisations did very little to
discover employees' views on how effective their training had been. This
made it very difficult to ascertain if training programmes had been
successful.
Many employers were 'wasting precious investment' in skills, said Mr Andrew
Forrest, the society's human resources director. Organisations needed to
take two vital steps to ensure the maximum return on their investment in
skills.
'Training has to be closely linked to business objectives, not a sideshow
with little connection to corporate strategy,' he said. 'Employers need
systems to evaluate the aims of training before it happens and the
effectiveness of training after it happens.'
The Investment in People initiative, administered by training and enterprise
councils, is intended to help companies link their training more effectively
to their business plan.
Mr Forrest said a surge in support for the scheme was an encouraging sign
that organisations were trying to tighten control of their training
activity. Tecs were becoming increasingly effective at serving business
locally, with IIP one of the topics they were most often contacted about.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Minister tries to calm fears on councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S new policy for local government reorganisation will not
lead to district councils taking over the functions of county councils, Mr
David Curry, local government minister, said yesterday.
Instead, single-tier authorities would be created by merging adjacent
district authorities which would be given wider powers.
Mr Curry told a conference of the Association of District Councils: 'It is
certainly not our intention that existing district councils will become
unitary councils. I wish to make sure that the new councils can effectively
tackle the problems of dealing with strategic issues.'
He said that creating a mass of small unitary authorities would lead to the
creation of new joint bodies, and added: 'If you do that, you might as well
keep the counties in the first place.'
Mr Curry refused to be drawn on an ideal size for the new authorities.
Mr Martin Easteal, chief executive of the Local Government Commission, said
he expected the new unitary authorities to have populations of between
150,000 and 250,000.
Mr Curry made clear to the commission that the government did not expect it
to recommend maintaining the status quo of two-tier county and district
councils.
He said: 'If we were to be invited to do that we might well decide we wished
to revisit those recommendations.'
Mr Curry's statement followed last week's poll conducted for the commission
by MORI in County Durham, which found an overall majority of the voters
favouring the status quo.
Sir John Banham, chairman of the commission, described the views of the
local electorate as 'the jury' for any proposals.
He said he was 'most unlikely to discount the clearly expressed view of a
representative sample of the people of Durham who have had a chance to look
very closely at a range of unitary councils and are clearly unimpressed by
them'.
However, Mr Curry said: 'If I wanted the entire reorganisation to be
determined by MORI, I would have asked them to carry it out in the first
place.'
He added that local authorities should now take the initiative in producing
options for mergers between councils which could then be evaluated by Sir
John.
If they did so, he said, they could 'lead public opinion'. The alternative,
he said, was 'falling back on the status quo'.

FT  19 OCT 93 / The ups and downs of air-launched nuclear missiles: The
latest project is by no means the first to be scrapped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's decision yesterday to abandon plans for a new air-launched
nuclear missile means that the RAF stands to lose the nuclear role it has
maintained since the V-bomber aircraft went into service with Britain's
first atomic bombs 40 years ago.
The project has been discussed, on and off, for six years. But Britain's
experience in the field of nuclear missiles for aircraft is a chequered saga
going back much longer.
The first plan was a glide-bomb called the Blue Boar, with a range of 25
nautical miles. It was abandoned in 1954 in favour of a longer-range cruise
missile, Blue Steel, which eventually went into service in two versions. But
plans were afoot to replace the V-bombers altogether with a ballistic
missile, Blue Streak.
In 1960, when Blue Streak was judged unviable and scrapped, the Macmillan
government plumped for a US-designed air-launched missile, Skybolt. Two
years later that project, too, was scrapped, this time by the US.
As a result Britain agreed to buy submarine-launched Polaris ballistic
missiles from the US, tipped with British warheads. But the RAF kept its
nuclear mission.
Its current WE177 gravity bomb - the RAF is believed to have about 100 left
 -has been in service even longer than Polaris. The new 'stand-off' weapon,
known in official jargon as a Tasm or tactical air-to-surface missile, was
meant to replace the WE177 at the end of the decade. Instead, Britain's
low-flying Tornadoes will have the bombs until well after the year 2000, and
no stand-off missile.
During the cold war the rationale behind a stand-off weapon was that it
would give aircraft a better chance of reaching their targets in the Soviet
Union and returning because it would allow pilots to stand off, or rather
stand back, from their target.
Talks with the US and France, each a potential partner, began in 1988. A
decision was expected the following year.
Politically, the prospect of a breakthrough in Anglo-French collaboration
bore particular significance, as a symbol of much closer defence ties. But
Britain preferred the US option, in the form of the SRAM-T, a nuclear
version of Boeing's Short-Range Attack Missile. Then history repeated
itself, when President George Bush stopped that programme in 1991.
This left another US option based on the SLAT, or Supersonic Low-Altitude
Target, as well as Aerospatiale's ASLP, a longer-range counterpart to the
ASMP cruise missile in service with the French air force.
More recently, Britain was looking at ways to cut missile programme costs.
Now that the cold war has passed, the importance attached to nuclear weapons
has been greatly reduced. But the UK has not dropped the principle of
fielding 'sub-strategic' weapons - intended for limited roles - as well as
strategic ones.
The idea is to stop a potential adversary, such as a 'rogue' country with a
newly made atomic bomb, from gambling on the calculation that nobody would
contemplate using the full force of strategic arms against it.
But the government has accepted the Navy's arguments that it can fulfil both
the strategic and sub-strategic roles with the Trident, the replacement for
Polaris, due to enter UK service in 1995. The US-supplied missiles, instead
of carrying up to eight nuclear warheads, could be equipped with a single
warhead.
One advantage of this argument is that the UK warhead for Trident has been
fully tested. Britain cannot do any more tests as long as the US keeps up
its moratorium, which may become permanent under a global test-ban treaty.
In any event, as one defence official admitted: 'There would not be much
support for any new nuclear weapon just at the moment.'

FT  19 OCT 93 / Business and local strategy surveyed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE action is needed to convince managers and financial institutions of the
commercial benefits of corporate community involvement, a survey by Opinion
Leader Research shows today.
The survey results will be launched at tonight's annual meeting of Business
in the Community's Per Cent Club - a group of business leaders pledged to
regular support for community activities - which will be addressed by Mr
John Major, the prime minister.
It shows that while many companies believe community involvement can
contribute to business performance through better competitive advantage,
public image, employee relations and customer loyalty, opinions of its value
differ among different sections of the business community.
While chairmen and chief executives had a broad understanding and acceptance
of the importance of the subject, says the survey, senior commercial
managers had a 'less clear understanding of, and a reduced commitment to,
community involvement.'
There was a need for companies to involve a wider management team in
community investment programmes. as a 'credible and essential part of the
core business strategy.'

FT  19 OCT 93 / MPs vent anger at threat of further cuts in defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMMONS defence committee vented its anger yesterday against the threat
of further cuts in Britain's defence budget, warning that the armed forces'
capabilities could fall 'below the minimum level necessary for the security
of the UK'.
Sir Nicholas Bonsor, the committee's Conservative chairman, said a Pounds
1bn cut in the Pounds 23.7bn military budget, which the Treasury is reported
to be seeking, would be 'wholly unacceptable'.
Representatives of all three main parties on the 11-strong committee spoke
out against further cuts at a press conference to launch two highly critical
reports, both warning of potentially dire implications for Britain's
defence.
One of the reports, on the Navy, said that in the event of a full-scale war
it would already be 'incapable of defending our sea-routes'.
Labour's Mr Bruce George said the decision to hold a press conference - only
the second in the 14 years since the select committee was set up  - was
itself an indication of how angry the members were.
On the Tory side, Mr Winston Churchill said any significant further cuts
would be 'a clear breach of faith with parliament, with the armed forces and
with the nation'.
The committee's report on the government's July Defence White Paper warned
that extra reductions would have a serious effect on morale following the
Pounds 1.05bn spending cut imposed last November.
'The armed forces desperately need a period of financial calm,' it said. It
repeated its previous warning that the number of Army personnel was
inadequate for its tasks.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Clocks change 'causes deaths'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PUTTING THE clocks forward one hour in summer and winter, to bring Britain
in line with much of continental Europe, would reduce road deaths and save
more than Pounds 200m in health service costs, says an independent report
published yesterday.
The author of the report, Dr Mayer Hillman of the Policy Studies Institute,
says there is now an unarguable case for not altering the clocks next
weekend.
He says business would benefit from the change. Tourism could be Pounds 1bn
better off and travel and communications throughout Europe would be improved
if all the European Community countries, apart from Greece and Ireland,
adopted the same time zone.
The report, Time for Change, has been backed up by an NOP poll in which 59
per cent of those surveyed were in favour of switching to Central European
time, with darker mornings and lighter evenings to provide people with more
leisure time.
Dr Hillman also says that crime would be cut because opportunistic offences
normally carried out under cover of darkness take place less in the morning.
The report says that savings on electricity bills for lighting would be more
than Pounds 250m and generating costs would be reduced because of the
lowering of demand in the afternoons.
Dr Hillman concludes: 'Many of the grounds cited by the minority opposed to
the change are weak or ill-founded. A common tendency has been to highlight
the problems for people in locations of extreme latitude and longitude, and
in situations occurring in the depths of winter.'
He says that in 1971 the government discontinued a three-year experiment,
keeping clocks an hour ahead of Greenwich Mean Time in winter as well as
summer. By not abandoning the project, Dr Hillman says, the government may
have averted 20,000 deaths or injuries.
He adds that Britain is paying a high price for the 'understandable' dislike
of starting winter days with an additional hour in the dark.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Gas monopoly 'keeps tariffs up'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE early abolition of British Gas's monopoly in supplying the mainly
residential market could lead to annual savings on gas bills of 8 per cent,
or Pounds 26 per household, according to a report issued yesterday by 12
independent gas companies.
The 12 reject the possibility that the removal of the monopoly could lead to
a rise of British Gas tariffs for small users, a possibility mentioned in
the recent Monopolies and Mergers Commission report into the future of
British Gas.
They also claim that British Gas's operating overheads are higher than those
of other energy utilities, and that an 'efficient supplier' could operate
with an annual standing charge of Pounds 32 per customer, compared with the
Pounds 36.88 charged by British Gas.
The report said concerns over safety and security of supply would be
addressed by the strict conditions likely to be imposed by the public gas
supplier licence, which the independents would have to obtain before they
could sell gas to households. The Gas Consumers Council welcomed the report.
Mr Ian Powe, council director, said 'If these 12 companies are prepared to
sign up to a strict gas supply licence and still undercut prices then the
sooner the monopoly is abolished the better.'
The independent suppliers, including six joint ventures between regional
electricity companies and Utilicorp UK, the British subsidiary of Utilicorp
of the US, called on Mr Michael Heseltine, trade secretary, to abolish by
1996 the British Gas monopoly on customers using less than 2,500 therms a
year.
The MMC has recommended that the threshold be lowered to 1,500 therms by
1997, and abolished three to five years after the recommended divestment of
British Gas's trading business from its pipeline operations by March 1997.
'It's frustrating to have to wait another four years if you are ready to
provide a service,' Mr Roger Turner, managing director of United Gas, said
yesterday. He called on the Department of Trade and Industry to 'lose no
time in putting the assertions to the test.' British Gas's 30,000 manual
workers at have won a 2.6 per cent pay rise, backdated to January, through
arbitration, the independent Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service
said yesterday. The rise, double the offer made by the company, takes the
average basic rate to Pounds 270.75 a week.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Fears of more pit closures increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS OF a new round of pit closures increased last night as Mr Neil Clarke,
British Coal chairman, warned that neither National Power nor PowerGen was
likely to provide the industry with significant contracts in the near future
above those already agreed.
He told a coal conference in Amsterdam that neither company would make
important additional commitments in the run-up to privatisation 'other than
at a price which would allow them to add to stocks in place of future
additional purchases'.
This is a reference to a suggestion by one of the generators that it may be
prepared to buy coal in the short term but only at a price considerably
below the 92p a gigajoule offered by British Coal.
British Coal is reluctant to agree to such a deal because it would
jeopardise future sales at a potentially higher price by a privatised coal
industry.
Mr Clarke's comments come amid anxiety in coal communities that the
corporation will move shortly, possibly this week, to close pits among the
15 or so considered vulnerable.
British Coal operates 30 pits, following 21 closures since last October.
Mr Clarke warned last week that he was pessimistic about the prospects of 12
mines reprieved by the government in a white paper last March. He told
yesterday's conference of international coal executives that the scope for
import penetration in the UK was very limited. The UK coal market was being
squeezed out by other fuels 'for reasons which appear to have little to do
with the economics of generating electricity.'
The Major Energy Users' Council, representing large companies including
Imperial Chemical Industries, has urged Offer, the electricity regulator, to
refer the electricity generators to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
In its submission the council says the MMC should examine the behaviour of
the electricity companies and the operation of the wholesale electricity
pool.
It asserts that there is 'little, if any, evidence of vigorous competition
and this is probably inevitable with a duopoly structure'.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Expansion of gas production in the southern North Sea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIBERALISATION of the British gas market has persuaded Amoco, the US oil
company with extensive North Sea operations, to embark on a Pounds 160m
investment programme to expand gas production in the southern North Sea,
Robert Corzine writes.
The company said the investment would extend the life of the Indefatigable
field 60 miles off Norfolk. It would also open up four smaller gas fields in
the same area.
Mr Mike Ambrose, Amoco commercial manager, said the expansion was only made
possible because British Gas was willing to renegotiate the original
depletion contract, which gave it sole access to all the gas in the area.
The new arrangement guarantees British Gas additional supplies, while
allowing Amoco to sell surplus gas in the open market.

FT  19 OCT 93 / BT hopes for Pounds 2bn revenue from video
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Telecommunications could generate revenue of about Pounds 2bn a year
by the end of the decade from video-on-demand services offered across its
telephone network, according to an internal company memorandum.
That would yield it profits of about Pounds 600m, assuming a base of about
8m subscribers, each paying about Pounds 250 a year at today's prices.
The memorandum - obtained by the FT's Telecom Markets newsletter - is
further evidence of BT's determination to enter the home entertainment
market, despite a government ban on it doing so before the year 2001.
Last week's Dollars 22bn (Pounds 14.5bn) takeover of Tele-Communications
Inc, the largest American cable TV company, by Bell Atlantic, the US
regional telephone group, will strengthen BT's resolve, as the biggest
indication yet that the telecommunications, cable, and entertainment
industries are converging.
BT argues that video-on-demand is not covered by the existing prohibition.
If - as seems likely - its board decides to go ahead with a pilot project,
it will face a protracted legal and regulatory battle, particularly with
cable companies (mostly US owned) building combined phone and cable TV
networks in conurbations.
The Independent Television Commission does not believe that BT needs a
special broadcasting licence to offer video-on-demand. But Oftel, the
regulatory authority, will have to clarify the terms of BT's licence. It has
still not been approached by the company.
BT projections of the size of the potential home entertainment market are
far more ambitious than those of most City analysts. They appear to
represent the views of those in the company lobbying hardest for a
video-on-demand service.
There is also doubt as to the technical capacity of the BT network to
provide a video-on-demand service. It plans to test its capability next year
in Colchester, Essex.
Digitally-compressed signals will go through the telephone wire at the same
time as the spoken word, with special decoders to translate them into
pictures. If the trials succeed, a large scale pilot project will follow to
cover about 25,000 homes by the spring of 1995.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Pollution liability worries banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS warned yesterday that lending to some industries could be cut off or
severely restricted if they were forced to bear financial responsibility for
pollution by companies that borrow from them.
The British Bankers' Association called for the uncertainty over legal
liability for pollution to be resolved quickly, but said it would be
counter-productive for banks to bear financial responsibility for polluting
companies.
Sir Nicholas Goodison, the association's president, said it would be
'intolerable' for banks to bear such costs in cases where they had taken
possession of a company's assets.
The association's call followed a speech by Mr Tim Yeo, environment
minister, last week in which he said that public funds could not bear the
costs of environmental clean-ups in all cases where a company is unable to
foot the bill.
Mr Yeo told the association that banks could not avoid financial liability
for pollution in all cases. He said that liability 'should follow
responsibility - possibly even to bankers under some circumstances'.
The association said yesterday that there was already evidence in the US of
banks refusing loans to companies in environmentally risky industries such
as chemical-making.
Mr Mike Pummell, the head of Barclays' environmental risk management unit,
said that environmental liability was a particular concern because banks
could face an unlimited potential risk even if they lent a small amount.
He said that banks were unlikely to take such risks if the government
clarified UK law in order to ensure that banks could bear financial
responsibility in cases where the polluting company was unable to pay the
costs.
Lord Inchyra, the association's director-general, said it was illogical for
a bank to bear more responsibility than 'the person who manufactured the
machinery, or supplied the concrete, or the power to make the thing work'.
Lord Inchyra said it was wrong for banks to take responsibility for lenders'
acts because they had 'deep pockets'. He said it could lead to a severe
restriction on finance for some industries.
The European Commission has issued a green paper on environmental liability,
and the government is carrying out a review of liability for polluted land
which is expected to lead to legal clarification.
Banks have been concerned that aspects of US law on liability could be
adopted in Europe. In one case a bank was held to be liable for pollution
costs if it had the capacity to influence management by virtue of having
lent money.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Redwood launches attack on 'yobs'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN REDWOOD, the Welsh secretary, last night launched a fierce attack on
what he called the 'yobbish tendency'.
Speaking to the Cardiff Business club, Mr Redwood, who caused a furore in
July with a speech on the social problems caused by single parent families,
said: 'There is in Wales and throughout Britain a revulsion against the
yobbish tendency. We don't want our public buildings defaced by graffiti. We
don't want the fences and roundabouts ripped out of our parks and
playgrounds. We don't want young men shouting and worse on the streets at
night.'
He added: 'The idea that the yobs who do these things have no choice, that
they are creatures of circumstances is nonsense. They are not prisoners of
time and place: they should be prisoners at Her Majesty's pleasure if
nothing else will stop them.'
Mr Redwood drew upon a visit to a primary school for his speech. He said
teachers had asked him how they could be expected to cope with discipline
when parents had lost control of 10-year-olds.
Ten-year-olds, he said, should not be out of control. 'Parents should know
where their children and younger teenagers are after dark. If we don't deal
firmly and quickly with the 10-year-olds, we will have little chance when
they are 15.'
Parents, neighbours and teachers had to take responsibility and the
government had to give a lead which, Mr Redwood said, was what Mr Michael
Howard, the home secretary, was doing.

FT  19 OCT 93 / New car sales forecast to fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECOVERY in new car sales will be thrown into reverse when next April's
company car taxation changes come into effect, according to a forecast
yesterday by the Charterhouse banking group.
The tax changes will cut company car purchases by 80,000 next year and a
further 40,000 in 1995 from this year's levels, says the report's author,
Professor James Morrell, the former director of Henley Centre for
Forecasting.
He says the decline in the company sector will more than offset increased
demand from private motorists, so that sales of new cars next year will fall
to 1.73m from this year's projected 1.78m, and to 1.72m in 1995.
The new system will base the tax payable by an employee on the private
benefit of a company car on a percentage of its list price when new, plus
any extras.
The forecast says many business car users will pay marginally less tax but

FT  19 OCT 93 / Gloom growing among consumers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GLOOMY report about consumer confidence has heightened worries that the
recent increase in spending by households will soon peter out, threatening
the economic recovery.
According to the Gallup market research group, fewer people last month
thought an upturn was imminent than at any time since March.
The number expecting the financial position of their households to improve
was at its lowest since November 1992.
The main factors depressing confidence appear to be fears of unemployment,
worries about a possible rise in tax in next month's Budget and
disappointing economic news including signs of increasing inflation.
Gallup said there was 'very little' to suggest that consumers would be a
driving force behind economic recovery.
The survey was based on a poll of 2,000 people every month on behalf of the
European Commission. The latest, conducted between September 30 and October
12, comes after several months in which consumer confidence seemed to be
increasing.
Last month only 24 per cent of people polled said they believed that the
economy would improve over the next year.
The proportion compared with 37 per cent who reckoned it would worsen. That
gave a negative balance of 13 percentage points, down 10 points from
September.
When people were questioned about the financial position of their
households, a negative balance of 15 per cent saw a deterioration next year
compared with 5 per cent in September.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Engineering companies suffer in the north
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENGINEERING companies in South Yorkshire and the north Midlands are
experiencing weakening prices and reduced margins, says the Sheffield
association of the Engineering Employers' Federation, Ian Hamilton Fazey
writes.
The association, which covers one of the UK's most intense concentrations of
manufacturing industry, says a survey of 107 companies has shown nearly 30
per cent suffering falling profitabil-ity in the past three months.
Mr Nicholas Kemp, the association's director, said yesterday: 'There is
intense competition both at home and abroad for engineering business, and
some prices have weakened. Almost a quarter of companies say prices are
worse and some are indicating worsening cashflow.'

FT  19 OCT 93 / Sharp rise in spending lifts PSBR
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP RISE in central government spending last month compared with a year
before pushed up the public sector borrowing requirement for September to
Pounds 5.88bn, Treasury figures showed yesterday.
In the first half of the financial year the gap between government spending
and revenues was 31 per cent higher than in the equivalent period of 1992,
in a development that may strengthen the case for a fiscal tightening in
next month's Budget.
The deterioration in public finances accelerated in the second quarter of
the financial year. This saw borrowing increase 40 per cent on a year
previously, after a year-on-year rise of 25 per cent for the first quarter.
The figures add weight to worries about the rapid rise in borrowing, which
has been caused partly by increased social security payments and a rise in
tax revenues that has been subdued because of the recession. The Treasury
expects the deficit to reach Pounds 50bn this financial year after Pounds
36.7bn in 1992-93.
The gap between government spending and revenues in September was slightly
above City expectations. It brought the PSBR for the first six months of the
financial year to Pounds 24.2bn after Pounds 18.4bn in the first half of
1992-93.
Last month central government departments spent Pounds 22.27bn, 14 per cent
up on the Pounds 19.5bn spent in September last year.
Central government revenues, mainly from tax, came to Pounds 16.1bn last
month, 7 per cent higher than the Pounds 15.1bn registered the previous
September.
In the first six months of the financial year, cash receipts by central
government departments came to Pounds 98.5bn, up 4 per cent on the Pounds
94.8bn collected in the same period last year.
Spending by these departments totalled Pounds 123.7bn in the first half, 8
per cent up on the Pounds 114.3bn for the first six months of last year.
Local authorities repaid Pounds 324m in September, compared with a Pounds
279m repayment 12 months before. In the first six months of the financial
year these authorities repaid Pounds 1.1bn after a repayment of Pounds 1bn
in the same period last year.
In the second quarter of the financial year the overall PSBR was Pounds
10.8bn after Pounds 13.4bn in the first quarter. The equivalent figures for
1992-93 were Pounds 7.7bn and Pounds 10.7bn.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Wholesalers lead distribution recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG and better-than-expected increase in sales among UK wholesalers in
September made up for a patchy performance among British retailers and
helped the UK distributive trades as a whole to their best year-on-year
growth in sales since May 1989.
While the Confederation of British Industry expects rising sales in the
retail, wholesale and motor trades this month, its latest survey of all
three distributive trades shows concern at the uneven growth of sales
volumes in Britain's high streets.
The survey, completed by 512 retailers, wholesalers and motor traders
between September 9 and October 6, suggests the three sectors as a whole
should this month have their biggest year-on-year increase in volume sales
for five years.
But the experiences of differing sectors vary widely. Among the 318
retailers polled, grocers, footwear and leather retailers and chemists
reported strong growth in sales volumes in the year to September and expect
further strong increases this month.
Specialist food stores said sales declined in the year to September, as did
retailers of durable household goods. Confectionery sales were unchanged.
Clothing retailers reported only a small increase in sales in the year to
September. This was expressed as a balance of plus 14 percentage points,
representing the difference between the percentage of outlets reporting an
increase in sales over the 12 months and the percentage disclosing a
decline.  This is the method used by the CBI to express sentiment.
Only two classes of retailer reported a year-on-year decline in sales. But
overall, retailers were far less satisfied with last month's volume of sales
than is normal for the time of year.
Grocers and merchants dealing in footwear and leather were the only
retailers to say their sales were better than average last month.
Even among chemists, where the balance of companies reporting sales growth
increased to plus 61 percentage points in September from 37 in August, the
number of companies saying business was poor for the time of year exceeded
those that said it was good by 14 points.
The September survey showed a further strengthening of market power among
the larger retailing chains. The number reporting increased sales volumes
last month exceeded those saying that sales declined by 31 percentage
points. This compared with an average of plus 25 points for the retail
sector as a whole. Single outlet retailers reported an overall drop in sales
compared with last September, with a balance of minus 10 points.
By contrast, the mood among wholesalers shifted from gloom in August to
optimism last month. The balance of companies reporting an increase in sales
jumped to plus 49 points last month from plus 11 points in August.
Motor traders reported 'reasonable' sales growth last month after August's
strong increase, with sales of parts and accessories growing faster than
vehicle sales.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Company share rules may be eased
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry is proposing to relax regulations on
companies giving financial assistance for the purchase of their own shares,
according to a consultative document released yesterday, Andrew Jack writes.
Companies would be allowed to provide financial assistance given in good
faith if the main reason was to achieve an objective judged to be in the
interests of the company. They would also be allowed to offer assistance if
it did not result in a significant reduction in the net assets of the
company.
It proposes relaxing procedures for shareholder approval, extending the time
period within which financial assistance can be given, and amendments to the
directors' statement and auditors' report.
The changes would be to sections 151 to 154 of the 1985 Companies Act, which
was designed to protect creditors and minority shareholders from the abuse
of companies' capital assets.
Responses should be received by the DTI by January 14 next year.

FT  19 OCT 93 / No 10 admits to row with Clinton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE British government acknowledged yesterday the strains placed on its
relationship with the US by the transatlantic dispute over the west's
handling of the Bosnian crisis.
The admission from Downing Street, which followed US President Bill
Clinton's public criticism of Britain and France, came amid fears that the
row over the embargo on arms sales to the former Yugoslav province will sour
the forthcoming Nato summit.
President Clinton's comments, in an interview with the Washington Post, also
brought a call from Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, for both
sides to patch up the relationship to ensure the stability of the western
alliance. The Anglo-American relationship had done more for the defence of
freedom than any other alliance in the world, she said.
Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, echoed Lady Thatcher's words,
saying 'finger pointing' between the allies served no purpose.
Despite obvious irritation at President Clinton's criticism of Mr John
Major, the prime minister's office sought to play down suggestions that the
dispute had damaged irreparably the so-called special relationship.
Officials said that Mr Major's warning to President Clinton that he could
not 'sustain' his government if the US insisted on lifting the arms embargo
on the former Yugoslav province was a statement of the obvious. A large
majority of ministers and MPs from all parties opposed any action which
would intensify the military conflict in Bosnia.
In his interview President Clinton said the United Nations had erred in
applying an arms embargo to Bosnia, as it gave the Serbs a major advantage.
Downing Street did nothing to disguise the fundamental nature of the
disagreement, even though Britain has technically not ruled out acceding
eventually to removal of the arms embargo.
But amid clear embarrassment at the president's decision to revive publicly
the differences, British officials sought to emphasise that Bosnia was the
exception rather than the rule in transatlantic relations.
Mr Major's aides said that on a whole range of other issues - ranging from
the Gatt world trade talks to the west's approach to Iraq and British
backing for US policy in Haiti - there was clear agreement between London
and Washington.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Chief executive of Welsh agency resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE of the Welsh Development Agency, Mr Philip Head,
resigned last night on the eve of the government's response to a highly
critical report about the agency by the Commons public accounts committee.
Mr Head has been chief executive of the government-funded agency since
January 1991. His resignation is one of a number of sweeping changes in the
management structure which are expected to be announced today.
Mr Head told the board he wanted to resign to 'enable a totally fresh
approach to be taken to the management of the agency'. He felt this would be
in its best interests. He will remain in the post until a replacement has
been found.
The report into the agency's accounts for 1991-92, which was published in
July, questioned the accountability of the agency and said poor management
practices had developed both in personnel matters and financial control.
Standards had fallen 'well below' what parliament had a right to expect. The
MPs called on the Treasury and Welsh Office to take urgent steps to ensure
the problems did not recur.
The report led to the agency's new chairman, Mr David Rowe-Beddoe, setting
up an internal inquiry under Sir John Caines, formerly permanent secretary
at the Department for Education. The findings of his inquiry are due to be
published today, and the response of Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary,
is also expected.
Mr Rowe-Beddoe, a businessman from the private sector who took over as
chairman from Dr Gwyn Jones, will detail the measures being taken by the
agency's board in the light of the public accounts committee report and the
Caines inquiry. It is likely that the management structure will be revamped
and some senior executives, in addition to Mr Head, are seen as vulnerable.
Mr Head, who is in his early 40s, joined the agency in 1978, only two years
after it was set up. Mr Rhodri Morgan, Labour MP for Cardiff West, said last
night: 'I bear Mr Head no ill-will, but his departure is part of the
long-needed root and branch overhaul of the WDA to bring it back to
political and financial respectability.'
The MPs' report criticised, among other matters, an unauthorised redundancy
scheme which incurred a loss of Pounds 1.4m, a scheme for free private
motoring for senior executives, the appointment of a fraudster as a
marketing director, and an apparent attempt to conceal the so-called
Operation Wizard to consider partial privatisation.
The MPs also blamed the Welsh Office for lack of supervision. Mr Redwood
said he took the criticisms very seriously and subsequently warned chairmen
of Welsh Office independent bodies that they must insist on the 'highest
standards of conduct'.
Mr Rowe-Beddoe, who was appointed the agency's chairman on July 1, promised
'appropriate remedial action' following the accounts committee report.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Clarke faces cabinet tax pleas today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH Clarke will today face calls from cabinet colleagues to avoid
jeopardising the apparently faltering economic recovery by imposing large
tax increases in next month's Budget.
But a full-scale cabinet debate of the options for November 30 will also
hear a warning from the chancellor that the government's borrowing
requirement is still on course to reach a record Pounds 50bn this year.
Mr Clarke will tell his colleagues that, despite the latest disappointing
output statistics, the economy should still grow faster this year than the
1.25 per cent predicted in March. Inflation will be lower than the 3.75 per
cent envisaged by Mr Norman Lamont, his predecessor.
His cautious optimism, however, will not extend to the outlook for the
borrowing requirement, leaving open the real prospect of further tax
increases. Mr Clarke has stressed repeatedly that the medium-term path for
borrowing set out by Mr Lamont will not restore the Treasury's finances
quickly enough.
But as MPs returned to Westminster yesterday after the summer break, cabinet
colleagues said that large tax increases in addition to the Pounds 10bn
annual increase announced by Mr Lamont would endanger the fragile economic
upturn.
Only a small minority of rightwing ministers - most notably Mr John Redwood,
the Welsh secretary - want the chancellor to resist any further rise in
taxation. But others were last night scaling back their views of what would
be an 'acceptable' pack-age.
One senior minister said unless the economy showed stronger signs of growth,
additional tax rises of more than Pounds 2bn or Pounds 3bn would risk a
backlash from Conservative MPs.
That assessment was echoed by another member of the cabinet who suggested
that Mr Clarke should be aiming for a 'symbolic' rather than substantial cut
in borrowing until the recovery was firmly established.
Others, however, believe that the chancellor could opt for phased increases
of about Pounds 5bn if the package was accompanied by a reduction in
interest rates of at least 1 percentage point.

THE GOVERNMENT'S insol-vency service is failing to disqualify enough
directors of collapsed companies, says a highly critical National Audit
Office report to be released tomorrow.
The audit office, the watchdog on government spending and efficiency, calls
for greater efforts by officials to debar from future directorships
executives who have been responsible for the failure of their companies. The
report says the insolvency service, part of the Department of Trade and
Industry, has failed to prosecute many directors criticised by official
receivers and by private-sector insolvency practitioners appointed as
receivers and liquidators.
The insolvency service gained powers to bring prosecutions under the 1986
Directors' Disqualification Act, which allows the courts to suspend
individuals from holding directorships. In 1992-93, 651 directors were
disqualified against a total of 450 in 1991-92.
But the audit office estimates that only half of the cases against directors
identified by practitioners or the service's own staff as candidates for
disqualification have been pursued for prosecution.
It also highlights considerable variations by the regional offices of the
service in pursuing directors for disqualification.
The attack comes when record numbers of companies have failed and insolvency
practitioners within accounting firms have been expressing concerns that
their recommendations are not being pursued hard enough by the service.
The insolvency service - often supported by practitioners - has argued in
the past that its failure to disqualify more directors reflects insufficient
funding.
That concern led to a 9 per cent budget and staffing increase in the
insolvency service approved by ministers during the current year. The audit
office's report calls for greater publicity for the penalties of
disqualification and of those who have been prosecuted. A survey it
conducted of company directors showed that half were not even aware of the
existence of the legislation and its penalties.
It also criticises provisions within Scottish insolvency legislation which
allow companies without any assets to be dissolved without the option for
scrutiny of directors.

FRANCE was urged yesterday to seek support from developing countries to
counter the Cairns group of food exporters, which has sided with Washington
in the dispute over farm trade subsidies.
The suggestion was put to Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, by
Mr Luc Guyau, leader of FNSEA, the main French farmers' union.
Mr Guyau said France should invite developing countries to a conference on
the Gatt agricultural issue, to show that 'defence of French and European
agriculture is not directed at them, but rather constitutes a factor of
world balance'.
France has long argued that a hungry world needs French food. But Mr Guyau's
idea stemmed as much from a desire to replicate in agriculture the success
that President Francois Mitterrand had over a cultural issue on Sunday, at
the summit of French-speaking countries in Mauritius.
The president got leaders of 47 countries and regions to side with French
demands that broadcasting and films should be protected from US 'cultural
imperialism' and excluded from any Gatt accord.
Meanwhile, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, Germany's economics minister, urged continued
flexibility from both the US and the European Commission yesterday in their
negotiations to conclude the Gatt round.
In a telephone call to Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, he
called on both sides not to 'dig themselves into their present positions'.
No details emerged of his apparent mediation effort, but a German official
said there appeared some possibility of movement on tariffs and customs
duties concerning textiles on the US side and non-ferrous metals on the EC
side.
Germany is clearly concerned at the apparent lack of flexibility on the US
side in the talks, fearing that the negotiations to finalise the North
American free trade area make it impossible for Washington to make any other
Gatt concessions.
Mr Rexrodt is apparently seeking any area of possible movement in the talks,
even if it does not directly affect the most difficult issues of farm trade.
Mr Balladur yesterday saw the complete spectrum of French political, farm,
industry and show business leaders in seeking a consensus for his
negotiating position in the Gatt trade talks.
After conceding on television on Sunday that Gatt was 'a trap for his
government', offering it only a choice between an international or a
domestic crisis, Mr Balladur called a succession of leaders and
opinion-formers to his office, the Matignon.
Over the weekend Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission,
made a rare public intervention in the Gatt debate, warning France of the
risks of isolating itself over farm trade.

<TEXT>
MR Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, yesterday warned the US and the European Community that their
failure last week to make progress on tariff reductions had put the Uruguay
Round of global trade talks in jeopardy.
'The simple fact is that we need a breakthrough now,' he said. Without this
'in the coming days' it would be virtually impossible to conclude the
multilateral negotiations on improving market access for farm and industrial
goods by the agreed date of November 15.
A successful conclusion to the talks on lowering tariffs and other trade
barriers to imported goods is seen as essential to securing agreement on
controversial aspects of the Uruguay Round draft rules package, including
farm trade reform, before the December 15 deadline.
Mr Sutherland called for 'new and urgent moves' by the US and EC to
'demonstrate leadership' on market access and said that if their negotiators
could not make rapid progress then ministers of the Quad nations - the US,
EC, Japan and Canada - should meet 'to thrash out a deal before it is too
late'.
The EC's new tariff offer, due to be tabled soon, has already been
criticised by Washington as not going far enough, while EC negotiators say
the US has not sufficiently cut peak tariffs on textiles.
Meanwhile, ministers from the 14-strong Cairns Group of agricultural
exporting countries ended a meeting in Geneva with a warning that a
substantial market access package was essential if the group was to accept
the Blair House accord on farm subsidies negotiated by the US and EC last
year.
Mr Peter Cook, trade minister of Australia, which chairs the group, said at
a news conference that if French-led EC pressure produced a weakened Blair
House deal 'the chances of acceptance would be zero'. Cairns countries have
not endorsed the bilateral accord, which they regard as a lamentable
dilution of the earlier draft Gatt agreement on farm trade reform.
Mr Cook, who will go to Paris, Bonn and Brussels this week, made a vigorous
though veiled attack on France, saying that querying the December 15
deadline sabotaged the negotiating process.

FT  19 OCT 93 / World Trade News: British machine tool hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH machine tool industry is hoping to increase its exports to the
US following a successful trade mission for the automotive and related
industries, such as construction equipment.
A dozen senior executives from companies such as General Motors,
Caterpillar, Deere and Dana have just completed a week touring UK machine
tool factories. The mission was organised by the UK's Machine Tool
Technologies Association, with financial support from the Department of
Trade and Industry.
Increasing exports to the US, the world's third biggest consumer of machine
tools, is particularly important for the British machine tool industry. Last
year the US regained from Germany its position as the UK's biggest single
export market for machine tools, with equipment worth Pounds 50.8m sold
there.
This year the German market has continued to fall while the US is
recovering, albeit slowly, as customers in manufacturing industry become
more confident about buying capital equipment.
Imports accounted for approximately 45 per cent of the Dollars 3.9bn (Pounds
2.6bn) US market last year.

FT  19 OCT 93 / World Trade News: US ultimatum over Japan building bids -
Tokyo rejects November 1 deadline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US will impose sanctions on Japan on November 1 unless Tokyo agrees to
open its construction market to bids from foreign companies, according to US
officials in Tokyo.
Feelers have been received indicating that the Japanese might have further
proposals during the overall 'framework' talks in Tokyo this week. However,
anything less than a deathbed conversion is unlikely to be unacceptable.
The US and Japan have for seven years been at odds over US demands that
Japan open its construction market further to foreign companies and increase
transparency in its bidding system. After all the grandly trumpeted
agreements, US companies have achieved only a 0.07 per cent share of the
Japanese public sector construction and design market and 0.003 per cent
share of the private sector market.
The US set an initial deadline for Japan to meet its demands in opening the
construction market in July, which was extended to November 1 by the US
Trade Representative.
The US has indicated that unless an agreement between the two sides is in
place on November 1, barring intervention by President Bill Clinton,
sanctions covering all government procurement that is not covered by the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade would automatically go into effect.
How many projects and sales this covers has not yet been determined, but it
is expected to be modest.
In June the US indicated that it was looking to Japan to fulfil four
principles in opening up its construction market: an open and competitive
bidding system, application of such a system in all big projects above a
certain level, greater enforcement of anti-monopoly laws, and the
enhancement of annual data collection to assess progress made.
Mr Kozo Igarashi, Japan's construction minister, has recently indicated his
determination to try to solve the construction row before the November 1
deadline, but so far a Japanese proposal to reform its bidding process has
not been received very well by the US.
The Japanese authorities are offering to introduce a conditional open
bidding system which would allow companies ranked as 'A-class' by the
Construction Ministry to bid in certain projects.
The proposal has not gone over well with the US, in part because as far as
the ministry is concerned no foreign company has ever been 'A' ranked,
according to a senior US official. 'This whole problem sounds a lot like a
Catch-22,' the official remarked.
The Japanese proposal also includes a disqualification process but no
guarantee that companies would be told in advance of how they might be
disqualified, the official said. Washington believes that as Tokyo has wide
discretion about who can bid, there will be considerable room for
discrimination.
Meanwhile, Japanese officials continue to refuse to accept the deadline,
which they claim was set by the US without warning and although the formal
deadline for US sanctions is fast approaching, no talks have been arranged
so far between the two sides.
'The deadline was announced out of the blue,' protested a Japanese
Construction Ministry official dealing with the negotiations. 'No country is
going to change its own domestic way of doing things because it is being
threatened with sanctions by another country.'
In Washington, officials scoff at the suggestion that the US is rushing the
process. They have fully expected US-Japan trade relations to worsen before
they improve. They are poised to take a tough stand here and elsewhere both
to show Tokyo they mean business and to send the same message to a restive
Congress.

<TEXT>
MR Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, yesterday saw the complete
spectrum of French political, farm, industry and show business leaders in
seeking a consensus for his negotiating position in the Gatt trade talks.
After conceding on television on Sunday night that Gatt was 'a trap for his
government', offering it only the alternative between an international or a
domestic crisis, Mr Balladur called a succession of leaders and
opinion-formers into his office, the Matignon.
Over the weekend Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission,
made a rare public intervention in the Gatt debate, warning France of the
risks of isolating itself over farm trade.
In a French television interview he said France was 'inventing its own
Maginot Line' - a reference to the elaborate but ultimately ineffective line
of defences built against the Germans during the two world wars.
Aides said yesterday Mr Delors was worried by the escalating rhetoric in
France. One sign of the 'malaise' in the Gatt debate was the way in which a
report in favour of free trade drawn up Mr Patrick Devedjian, the moderate
RPR Gaullist deputy, was simply killed in committee.
Mr Delors's criticism of the French government's position was balanced by
sharp words for the US, which he said had failed to follow through on
commitments on market access made last July in Tokyo.
Most important, and for the moment predictably, he won a pledge of 'complete
support' from the leader of his own RPR Gaullist party, Mr Jacques Chirac. A
possible tussle between the two men for the presidency in 1995 could turn on
the farm vote, which Mr Chirac has always courted assiduously. Mr Valery
Giscard d'Estaing, leader of the other government coalition party, the UDF,
is due to see Mr Balladur later today.
Mr Balladur got only an ambiguous promise from Mr Michel Rocard, leader of
the Socialists, the main opposition party, that he would remain 'vigilant'
in watching out for French interests.
While the Communists said they could not support Mr Balladur 'for the
moment', because he was not being tough enough, and the Greens pushed for a
strong French stance in Gatt, the prime minister found some backing from Mr
Jean-Marie Le Pen, the right-wing nationalist, who said he was ready to
participate in 'the broad national consensus' that Mr Balladur is seeking in
the run-up to the December 15 deadline for the Gatt talks.

FT  19 OCT 93 / World Trade News: EC doubts on two-tier services proposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community trade negotiators yesterday expressed concern over a
controversial US Uruguay Round proposal to deny Japan and developing
countries the benefits of liberalisation of the US banking and insurance
sector.
They have warned the proposal could unravel other countries' commitments to
open up their service sectors to international competition, and jeopardise
completion of the round by the deadline of December 15.
The proposal, discussed in Brussels yesterday by Mr Lawrence Summers, US
Treasury undersecretary, during an early morning meeting with Sir Leon
Brittan, EC trade commissioner, would involve giving all countries open
access to the US financial services sector as it now stands, but reserving
to industrial countries - minus Japan - the benefits that would come from
further liberalisation of the US financial services market.
Most significantly, this would exclude Japan and other developing countries
from setting up universal banking operations in the US if and when the Glass
Steagal Act, limiting banking licences to a single state, is reformed.
The US is considering this two-tier approach to trading partners out of
frustration at the reluctance of Japan, South Korea and the Asean nations of
Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia to open their
banking, insurance and stock market sectors to international competition.
Gatt estimates that commercial services affected by financial services
liberalisation amounts to Dollars 12,000bn (Pounds 7,947bn). The US proposal
is seen by trading partners as contentious in particular because it
apparently shows the US is unwilling to abandon bilateral leverage against
trading partners when Uruguay Round negotiations aim to win wider support
for multilateral settlement of trade disputes.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MS Benazir Bhutto was last night almost certain to return as Pakistan's
prime minister in today's parliamentary vote, with her Pakistan People's
party (PPP) expected to build a coalition with smaller parties in the
National Assembly, the lower house of parliament.
Sunday's victory for Mr Yusuf Raza Gillani of the PPP, for the position of
Speaker, had already confirmed Ms Bhutto's lead over Mr Nawaz Sharif, her
arch-rival. The PPP is also expected to form governments in at least two of
Pakistan's four provinces (Sindh and Baluchistan), while Mr Sharif's
Pakistan Moslem League (PML) appears to be leading in the North-West
Frontier Province.
However, the two sides are still engaged in a tough fight for the province
of Punjab, the country's largest and wealthiest province. Members of the
provincial legislatures are due to elect their governments tomorrow.
Ms Bhutto's latest victory has effectively ended her three-year stint as
leader of the opposition, since her government's dismissal in August 1990 on
charges of corruption. She feels vindicated because none of the charges laid
against her or Mr Asif Ali Zardari, her husband, has been proved.
However, her return still needs to be consolidated through the formation of
a stable government which can resist opposition pressure. Although Mr Sharif
is out of power, that has not curtailed his ability to build up his ranks by
winning over members of smaller parties allied to Ms Bhutto.
One of Ms Bhutto's most important challenges will be to carry forward the
recent negotiations with the International Monetary Fund.
Pakistan is seeking up to Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 790m) under the extended
structural adjustment facility and extended finance facility over the next
three years.
Her aides have already said Pakistan's economic direction will remain
unchanged, with emphasis on privatisation and deregulation of the public
sector. But it is still not clear if sensitive measures such as a wealth tax
on powerful feudal landlords, which were introduced by Mr Moeen Qureshi, the
interim prime minister, can be retained, with most of the newly-elected
members representing the rich farmers' lobby.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KENYA is to rationalise its dual exchange rate system today by floating the
official rate of the shilling to the level of the free market rate, Finance
Minister Musalia Mudavadi said yesterday.
The measure will lead to a small devaluation of the official shilling, which
is used in central government purchases and debt-service payments.
At the start of business yesterday the official exchange rate was 67.6
shillings to the dollar and the inter-bank commercial rate was 68.85
shillings - a gap of less than 2 per cent. Import bills and most private
sector transactions are settled at the inter-bank rate.
International Monetary Fund and World Bank officials, currently reviewing
Kenya's economic progress in Nairobi, had recommended the merger as a step
towards the abolition of currency controls.
Mr Mudavadi said the flotation would encourage exporters, who must remit
half of their foreign earnings to the central bank, which reimburses them in
local currency at the official rate of exchange.
The flotation is the latest of several liberalisation measures which have
included three devaluations since December.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Native rights will apply to farm leases, says Keating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, yesterday delivered a blow
to the nation's farmers when he hinted that proposed native land rights
legislation would allow claims against land held under pastoral leases.
The government had previously indicated that only mining leases would fail
to extinguish native title, which, in turn, could 'co-exist' with the mining
lease and revive once the latter expired.
During parliamentary question time yesterday, Mr Keating said he expected
only about 11 pastoral leases issued between the implementation of the 1975
Racial Discrimination Act and 1993 to be affected by the government's
legislation.
But he said native title claimants could make claims under common law on all
of the thousands of pastoral leases issued before 1975.
The government has been battling to draw up a system for deciding Aborigine
land claims, in the wake of a High Court decision last year. This ruling,
known as the 'Mabo' decision, threw out the notion that Australia was
essentially unoccupied before European settlement, and suggested the
Aborigine claims could be valid where there had been close and continuing
association with the land in question.
The National Farmers' Federation campaigned strongly for a ban on native
title rights on all pastoral leases. Aboriginal groups, by contrast, argued
that pastoral leases should be among the leases which did not extinguish
native title rights.
Mr Keating said yesterday the legislation would allow states to validate all
pastoral leases without the lessees having to disprove the existence of
residual native title. Holders of pastoral leases on land covered by native
title would have primacy, with no question of co-ownership.
'The only question then at issue is whether in validating these leases, we
should go so far as to extinguish native title completely and forever, or
whether we should leave the relationship between lease rights and native
title to the common law,' he said.
Under the envisaged legislation, native title claimants would still be able
to claim residual rights through claims in the courts.
Mr Keating added he believed such cases had little chance. The Australian
cabinet was meeting to discuss the draft 'Mabo' legislation yesterday, and
there have been suggestions it could be presented to parliament in a matter
of weeks.

INTERNATIONAL donors have agreed a Dollars 600m aid package in grants and
loans for the occupied territories for 1994, according to Mr Avraham
Shochat, Israel's finance minister.
The sum is part of a five year Dollars 2.5bn external financing programme,
agreed in Washington this month, for the interim period of Palestinian
self-rule in the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank.
Mr Shochat said the incoming Palestinian authority might be able to draw
money from the budget before 1994 to assist in the creation of a Palestinian
police force. A substantial part of the budget would also be allocated to
spending on education, health and social services by a Palestinian authority
which will take over from the Israeli military-run administration when the
Israelis withdraw from the Gaza Strip and Jericho by April 13.
An international steering committee will meet in Paris on November 5 to
hammer out details of disbursing the aid. The committee is expected to be
chaired by Norway and assisted by the World Bank, which is carrying out
extensive research on the needs of the occupied territories and the possible
mechanisms of disbursement. Two crucial problems facing international donors
are the lack of a Palestinian implementing authority and the question of who
will sign for loans to a Palestinian administration, which will not be
recognised as a government.
Mr Shochat said that Israel, which is contributing Dollars 25m of aid and
Dollars 50m of political insurance or guarantees to Israeli investors over
five years, was concerned about the possible shortfall of taxation revenues
in the early days of a Palestinian authority and was stressing the
importance of meeting recurrent expenditures currently paid for from tax
revenues collected by Israel in the territories and subventions from the
Israeli treasury.
'To enable the population in the territories to support the peace agreement
they must see something change from the economic point of view in
investments, job creation and standard of living,' Mr Shochat said.
The minister said the steering committee would try to avoid approving
projects which did not directly serve the pressing economic needs of the
territories and would press governments to provide insurance cover to
private companies which would have to be the engine of growth.
A separate Palestinian-Israeli ministerial economic committee would also
meet soon, Mr Shochat said, to discuss the broader issues of macro-economic
policy between the two sides such as migrant labour, harmonisation of
taxation and currency.
Mr Shochat said multilateral agencies such as the World Bank and the
European Development Bank would be the key implementing agencies of
infrastructure projects.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Kashmir militants raise the stakes: Mass protests threatened
unless Indian army lifts shrine siege

<TEXT>
KASHMIRI political groups yesterday threatened to call mass demonstrations
on Friday, the Moslem holy day, unless the siege of the holiest Moslem
shrine in the troubled state of Kashmir is lifted.
About 10,000 troops and police have surrounded the white marble Hazrat Bal
shrine in Srinagar, the Kashmiri capital, since Friday when they trapped
militants inside the building after a tip-off that they were planning to
remove a relic (a strand of hair said to be the Prophet Mohammed's) and
blame the government for its disappearance.
The 50 separatist insurgents inside the shrine have threatened to blow it up
if negotiations with the authorities fail.
Around 100 pilgrims are also inside the shrine.
The militants have demanded the removal of the army cordon, safe passage for
themselves and the handing over of the holy relic to Moslem clergy.
The government in New Delhi, campaigning for the crucial state elections in
November, is particularly keen to resolve the deadlock peacefully.
'One false move and we will have a crisis on our hands,' said a senior
official in the prime minister's office. The militants, who are unlikely to
cause any real harm to the shrine because it would only alienate them from
the public, are holding out in the hope that the government will attack them
and destroy the building, inflaming religious passions.
Embarrassed that the incident has brought the four-year-old Kashmiri crisis
into the glare of the international community, the government is prepared to
accept foreign mediation.
India has been particularly defensive about allegations from foreign
governments and human rights organisations that human rights are being
violated by the army in Kashmir. The government has blamed Pakistan for
funding and supporting the separatist movement in Kashmir, and has also
accused Pakistan for being directly responsible for the occupation of the
mosque.
Srinagar was tense but mostly quiet yesterday with a military curfew
enforced in the centre of the city and the rest affected by a protest strike
called by the militants.
Mr Abdul Ghani Lone, representative of the All Party Freedom Conference, an
umbrella organisation of separatist political groups, blamed the government
for starting the siege. He said that if the crisis was not resolved by 3pm
today he and other political leaders would break the curfew and march
towards the mosque. He called on all Kashmiris to start marches on Friday if
the siege is not ended.
However, residents said they doubted if demonstrations would be large, given
the scale of the security forces present. Kashmiris mostly support the
militants' goal of greater autonomy.
General B C Joshi, chief of the Indian army, said yesterday that the
operation against the militants in Hazrat Bal would continue until they
surrendered.
But he ruled out the use of force unless the army was provoked unduly by the
militants.
The strategy of the operation, Gen Joshi said, was to 'tire them out and
break their will.'

FT  19 OCT 93 / First-half surplus at record Dollars 60bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S efforts to curb its politically troublesome trade surplus brought
little result in the first six months of the fiscal year, when the balance
widened to a record Dollars 60.07bn (Pounds 39.7bn). The balance, for the
six months to the end of September, is the highest for a six-month period
and 15.2 per cent more than the surplus in the first half of last year,
according to a preliminary finance ministry report yesterday.
This is entirely due to the Japanese currency's rise in value against the
dollar, since the surplus for the first six months actually declined by 2.3
per cent in yen terms. Nevertheless, the record dollar surplus is likely to
add to strains in talks between the US and Tokyo on improving access for
foreign companies to several Japanese market sectors.
Within the total, the surplus last month rose by 5.4 per cent year-on-year
to Dollars 12.73bn, the 33rd month in a row in which it has increased. In
yen terms, however, the trade surplus declined in September for the second
month in a row, to Y1,330bn (Pounds 8.1bn), down 11.2 per cent on September
1992.
In an encouraging sign for an improvement in previously sluggish Japanese
consumption, imports last month rose by 6.4 per cent to Dollars 20.79bn,
spread across most sectors. Within this, imports of machinery grew 20.6 per
cent, food 4 per cent and textiles 16.9 per cent, though imports of fuel
fell 12.3 per cent.
Import demand should increase, thanks to the impact of the government's
economic stimulation packages, finance ministry officials predicted. The
September imports rise brings the total for the six months to Dollars
121.7bn, or 5 per cent more than the same period last year. Exports rose
faster by 8.2 per cent over the same period to Dollars 181.77bn.
However, the outlook for domestic demand is uncertain, the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry warned. Industrial production in August
fell a revised 1.2 per cent from the previous month, against its original
estimate of a 0.7 per cent fall, Miti said.
Output would continue to be sluggish because of the uncertainty of demand
and the slowness with which companies are expected to be able to reduce
inventories.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Japan's MPs begin debate on reforms: Hosokawa stakes his
reputation on getting four bills passed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S lower house of parliament yesterday began its first full-scale
debate on the new government's plan for the most radical reform of the
political system since the 1940s.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, has staked his political
reputation on passing the four reform bills by the end of the year, widely
interpreted as a pledge to resign if they fail. Political observers agreed
yesterday that Mr Hosokawa's chances are finely balanced, despite his high
popularity.
The bills, prepared by the seven-party coalition, aim to end the corruption
which contributed to last July's election defeat of the conservative Liberal
Democratic Party after 38 years in power and after several failed attempts
at reform.
Under the present system, the lower chamber has a multi-seat constituency
system, discredited for pitting candidates of the same party against each
other, so encouraging them to use money and influence, rather than policies,
to attract votes.
The government proposals would create a 500-seat lower chamber, in place of
the present 511 seats, of which 250 would be in single-seat constituencies
and 250 chosen by proportional representation. Voters would cast two
ballots.
Corporate donations to individual politicians would be banned, though
companies would be allowed to give cash to political parties. There would be
a state subsidy of Y41.4bn (Pounds 254m) a year to parties, to distribute to
politicians, under the government's plans.
Mr Hosokawa said yesterday he wanted to push the reform plans through the
House of Representatives, the lower chamber, by November 5 to leave enough
time for them to get through the House of Councillors, the upper chamber, by
the end of the year.
His chances of success are complicated by the fact that an unknown number of
members of the Social Democratic Party, the largest coalition partner, plan
to vote against the bills. The SDP is unhappy with single-seat
constituencies, because it feels it would do less badly under proportional
representation.
Some LDP rebels could vote with the coalition, but it is not yet clear
whether there will be enough defectors to give the government a majority.
Soon after the election defeat, many in the LDP felt the reform debate would
be a chance to bring down Mr Hosokawa quickly. However, his subsequently
high popularity ratings (more than 70 per cent in recent polls) indicated
that the LDP might suffer if it were publicly held responsible for derailing
Mr Hosokawa and political reform, political observers say.
Instead, the LDP's interest has now switched to influencing the content of
the reform bills to its advantage. It wants to shift the balance towards
single-seat constituencies, in which big, well-funded parties such as the
LDP are expected to fare best.
Accordingly, the LDP has tabled a counterplan for a 471-seat house, of 300
single-seat constituencies and 171 under proportional representation, chosen
by a single ballot. Individual politicians would be allowed to receive
corporate donations, through fund-raising organisations, under the LDP plan.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Russia urged to call halt to dumping of nuclear waste
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

THE JAPANESE government will demand that Russia stop pumping nuclear waste
into the Sea of Japan immediately, it said yesterday, adding it had received
no advance warning from Moscow of the operation, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
'We had been asking them to stop such operations from last year,' Science
and Technology Minister Satsuki Eda told parliament. Prime Minister Morihiro
Hosokawa said the government would lodge a protest, pending further checks.
Tokyo might use part of a planned Dollars 100m (Pounds 66.2m) grant in aid
to Russia to help build facilities to dispose of nuclear waste, Mr Hideaki
Kumano, Vice-Minister of International Trade and Industry, told a news
conference.
The Dollars 100m aid grant, included in a Dollars 1.82bn Russian aid package
Japan pledged in April, is designed to help dismantle Russia's nuclear
weaponry.
The two sides agreed to set up a committee to decide how to use the cash
when Russian President Boris Yeltsin visited Japan last week. They also
signed an agreement on the problem of nuclear dumping. The pact called for a
joint investigation of radiation levels in the Sea of Japan.
The environmental group Greenpeace raised the alarm on Sunday after watching
a Russian navy vessel pour liquid waste directly into the Sea of Japan off
the Maritime Province in the Siberian Far East, despite a global moratorium.
Gillian Tett adds from Moscow: Russian officials said yesterday they would
press ahead with their dumping operation in spite of the strong Japanese
protests.
Mr Nikolai Ribelsky, deputy environment minister, defended the dumping and
said the liquid radioactive material was being transferred between tankers
in the second phase of an operation that started over the weekend.
He insisted the quantity already dumped, some 900 cubic metres of waste, did
not break accepted international standards.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Extra days off leave workers at a loose end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR BENICHI ETO, president of the Federation of Nippon Steel Workers' Unions,
contemplates the prospect of two extra days off from work each month and
looks troubled. 'With two extra days off from work, what would people do? I
don't know how people will use their time,' he says.
Mr Eto's concern follows last week's request from the world's largest steel
company to its workers to accept reduced working hours of about two days a
month from next month as an emergency measure to tide the company over a
difficult trading environment.
'We Japanese are not good at using our free time. If it had been in the old
days when we only had Sundays off, it probably would have been all right.
But with two days on top of the eight to 10 days people already take off
each month, they will say they have too many days off,' Mr Eto adds.
He is preparing to bow to the management request, even though it would mean
a cut in pay for all Nippon Steel employees, including managers. 'This is a
very rare case.'
The unions' contract with the company allows the introduction of emergency
holidays on condition the company pays 85 per cent of the basic salary of
those affected.
Nippon Steel's unions had been prepared for such an eventuality. 'The last
time the company introduced such a measure was during the previous rise of
the yen (in the mid-1980s). But since the economic situation today is worse
than before, we thought that this might happen.'
For the 43,000 members of Nippon Steel's labour unions, there is little
choice but to accept the company's request. The union leaders and their
43,000 members know that, in addition to three years of economic slowdown,
the industry is under pressure from the recent sharp appreciation of the
yen, which has made Japanese steel far less competitive than that of
overseas rivals.
But it is not just the steel industry which is suffering from the recession
and the yen's strength. Every Japanese manufacturing industry that competes
internationally is under pressure, making it hard to resort to job transfers
to subsidiaries and other industries, one of the first measures Japanese
companies turn to in times of trouble.
Already 13,000 of the unions' members have been transferred to several
hundred different companies, some of which are completely unrelated to
Nippon Steel, which is bearing the cost of making up the difference in pay
and other social benefits.
Union members also know their choice is between maintaining work, at reduced
pay, or facing redundancies for the first time.
'We are agreeing to the emergency holidays because the most important thing
is to maintain employment,' Mr Eto says. If the choice is between reduced
working days and reduced pay or redundancies, he has no doubt 'the company,
the labour union and individuals all need to make sacrifices to maintain
employment.'
He feels that, as parts of an industry leader, both the unions and
management of Nippon Steel have a responsibility to choose to keep
employment intact as a sign to the rest of Japanese industry. Other steel
companies are considering similar measures.
'If Nippon Steel makes redundancies, it would not be just a matter affecting
employees of Nippon Steel; it would affect the whole of the Japanese labour
system,' he notes.
Nippon Steel's unions are not blaming management for what is happening,
since they recognise that the problem they face is mostly to do with the
sharp rise of the yen.
Past experience may not be enough to overcome the industry's difficulties,
but Mr Eto is confident that if the situation worsens, the company can be
expected to take some unusual measures before it sheds employees.
'There is nothing stopping a company from borrowing money to maintain
employment,' he says. 'When we have seen that the company has used up all
its assets and is still unable to deal with the situation, we will have to
prepare ourselves for the worst.'
For the time being, the one request from the unions to management is to
ensure that the programme of reduced working days is introduced equally
among employees and that no exceptions are allowed.
As for Mr Eto himself, he will have to accept the salary cut, but will
probably not be able actually to take time off. 'For union officials, the
worse the recession becomes, the busier we are,' he says.

TWO black men were yesterday convicted on some charges stemming from the
beating of a white truck driver during last year's Los Angeles riots, but a
jury acquitted one defendant of attempted murder and deadlocked on the same
count against the other, Reuter reports from Los Angeles.
As police mounted a show of force on the streets to prevent any violent
reaction, Superior Court Judge John Ouderkirk ordered the jury to resume
deliberations on unresolved charges.
The most serious guilty verdict was against Damian Williams, 20, who was
convicted of causing mayhem in the assault on Reginald Denny. But the jury
were deadlocked on the attempted murder charge against him.
Henry Watson, 29, was acquitted of attempted murder but found guilty on a
count of assault. He was found guilty of the lesser crime of assaulting
several other motorists but acquitted on robbery charges stemming from those
attacks.
The defendants were thus spared from being sentenced to life in prison, the
mandatory sentence for attempted murder.
'We are elated that the jury came back and did not find guilt on the most
serious charges,' said Mr Don Jackson, a spokesman for the defendants'
families.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S Congress has been hit by allegations of corruption which could
impede work now under way on an important constitutional review and which
could further undermine the body's credibility ahead of next year's
elections.
The allegations were made by a former government official, Mr Jose Carlos
Alves dos Santos, who was responsible for the annual budget under former
presidents Jose Sarney and Fernando Collor.
Mr Collor resigned last year because of unrelated corruption charges.
According to Mr Santos, more than 20 members of Congress, as well as acting
and former government ministers, were involved in the corruption scheme,
which channelled 'fees' from construction projects to members in return for
having the projects cleared in the annual budget.
Mr Santos, who was arrested last week after police found forged banknotes at
his home and cocaine in an aircraft he had used, claims he received Dollars
1.2m (Pounds 800,000) for his role in the scheme.
It is not clear Mr Santos can prove his allegations that payments were made
to members, who include three acting state governors and a friend and close
adviser to President Itamar Franco. Several have said they will sue Mr
Santos. Late yesterday the two acting ministers said they were prepared to
resign to contest the claims in court.
Nevertheless, the allegations have rocked Congress and follow accusations
that 'transfer fees' were paid to members who switched allegiance to a small
political party earlier this month.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Wall St firms agree contributions ban: Self-imposed step
will have impact on future local elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HAVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of 15 of Wall Street's most powerful investment banking and
securities firms have agreed to stop making political contributions to US
government officials and election candidates who could award them contracts
to underwrite issues of local government securities.
The agreement on the voluntary ban, which has earned the support of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, was officially unveiled at the SEC in
Washington yesterday.
The group, including industry leaders Merrill Lynch, Smith Barney Shearson,
Goldman Sachs and Salomon Brothers, urged law firms, accountants, financial
advisers and other companies involved in the municipal finance process to
join the ban. A leading New York law firm, Skadden Arps, was part of
yesterday's pact.
Wall Street has been considering ending political contributions related to
the municipal bond business for over a year, but publicity surrounding
several recent political scandals helped persuade the firms to reach early
agreement.
No criminal action has been taken over any of the recent scandals, but they
reinforced the assumption among many voters that some Wall Street firms may
have been making financial contributions to local politicians in the hope of
bond underwriting business worth millions of dollars.
Yesterday's signatories said they hoped their initiative would restore
public confidence in the municipal securities market.
The ban will have a considerable impact on future local elections across the
US, because securities and investment banking firms have traditionally been
among some of the biggest financial backers of city and state politicians
campaigning for public office.
Mr Arthur Levitt, SEC chairman, said he remained concerned that some firms
might try to use political contributions by consultants, affiliates or
employees to attempt to influence municipal finance decision-making.
The ban should soon be backed by a new federal regulation proposed by the
Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. It is expected to come into effect
later this year or early 1994.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOR the second time in a week the Clinton administration was yesterday
gearing itself to beat back congressional attempts to dictate where and when
it may use US troops overseas.
On Sunday, Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, said he would submit a
bill preventing the administration from using force in Haiti unless the
president certified that vital US national security interests were involved.
Yesterday, Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, warned that passage of
the proposed Dole amendment, which would be tagged on to the current defence
appropriations bill, would be 'a very serious setback for the US'.
'Any provision which preconditions the ability of the president to use the
armed forces is offensive to the constitution,' he said.
Mr Dole had helped the administration last week defeat an amendment limiting
US military operations in Somalia. On Sunday morning, prior to the TV
interview in which he disclosed his proposal, he called President Bill
Clinton for a lengthy discussion, which prompted the senator to revise an
existing legislative draft.
The senator, in his TV interview, seemed particularly exercised at the
prospect of US lives being lost to reinstate Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the
ousted Haitian president. 'I think he has a lot of shortcomings,' Mr Dole
said.
Some members of the administration were inclined to suggest Mr Dole was
acting with his own political future in mind. Last week several
proto-candidates for the 1996 Republican nomination burst forth with
indictments of the administration's foreign policy at precisely the moment
Mr Dole was actively engaged in sustaining it on Somalia.
Mr Clinton meanwhile stepped up pressure on Haiti's army leaders yesterday
by signing an order freezing their assets. He also said he had ordered US
warships blockading Haiti to move closer to shore 'so they will be in plain
sight'. The ships are to enforce an oil and arms embargo.

THE JURY in the trial of two black men accused in the beating of a white
truck driver unexpectedly said yesterday it had resumed deliberations,
agencies report from Los Angeles.
The jury said at the weekend it had reached verdicts on some charges
stemming from the attack on trucker Reginald Denny during last year's Los
Angeles riots but was deadlocked on others and further deliberations would
be pointless.
Superior Court Judge John Ouderkirk had said he would take partial verdicts
from the racially mixed jury at yesterday's hearing 'unless something
unusual happens or I receive some kind of communication from the jury'.
On the streets, police stepped up patrols as a precaution against violence
in the wake of the expected verdicts, though officials said they did not
expect trouble. 'We're heavily deployed,' said Lt John Dunkin. 'But I want
to stress that we are very optimistic we are not going to have any problems
today.'
The alert was modest compared with the one in place in April, as the federal
trial of four white policemen accused of violating black motorist Rodney
King's civil rights neared its end. There was no trouble when two of the
officers were convicted and the other two acquitted.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton is expected to announce today his plan for cutting US
emissions of greenhouse gases to meet its pledge under the Rio de Janeiro
treaty on global climate change.
The plan relies mainly on voluntary measures intended to encourage the use
of more energy-efficient cars, lights and other equipment; this would reduce
the burning of fossil fuels and so cut emissions of carbon dioxide, the
principal greenhouse gas.
Employers which provide parking to employees would be required to make an
equivalent cash payment to those who use other forms of transport, with the
goal of encouraging people not to commute by car and cutting more than 8m
tons of carbon dioxide emissions.
Mr Clinton's plan also relies heavily on reinforcing sinks such as forests
that absorb greenhouse gases, by preserving forests and planting trees. This
step is estimated to cut another 8m tons of emissions.
None of the measures would cut emissions by nearly as much as Mr Clinton's
earlier proposal for an energy tax, which was abandoned in the face of
opposition from senators from oil-producing states.
In announcing the proposals, Mr Clinton is following up a promise he made
this year to commit the US to the target of reining its emissions of
greenhouse gases back to their 1990 level by the year 2000.
The US alone accounted for around 21 per cent of the world's entire
emissions of greenhouse gases. It produced 1.31bn tons of carbon dioxide in
1990, a figure projected to rise over the 1990s without restraining measures
by 100m tons.
Environmental groups yesterday were reluctant to criticise Mr Clinton's
plan, which they said was substantially more specific than the proposals
made by former President George Bush, but hoped for improvements over time.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Foreigners and Haitians flee amid rumours of invasion

<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of foreigners living in Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital, gathered
at its international airport yesterday in an effort to flee the country
following the broadcast of a statement by supporters of the military
government that all white foreigners should leave immediately.
An attempt by the military government, through another broadcast yesterday,
to retract the command appeared only to have added to the growing panic and
tension.
Meanwhile, Haitians are leaving the capital for the countryside in the wake
of rumours that a foreign military invasion is imminent as part of
international efforts to restore Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide as president.
Clashes between factions supporting Mr Aristide and those backing the
military government, which has refused to step down, claimed 16 lives over
the weekend, and appeared likely to continue yesterday as Mr Aristide's
supporters organised three days of mourning for Mr Guy Malary, the justice
minister who was assassinated on Thursday.
Diplomats said Haitians were convinced that foreign troops would land in a
matter of days unless the military rulers left office and made way for Mr
Aristide to return.
The fears of an invasion heightened at the weekend as warships from the US
and Canada took up positions off Haiti's coast to enforce an international
economic embargo aimed at forcing Gen Raoul Cedras, the military leader, and
other officers to step down in accordance with an agreement reached with Mr
Aristide in early July. Gen Cedras and Lt Col Michel Francois, the police
chief, have said they will not leave office.
The effectiveness of earlier attempts at an embargo have been frustrated by
hectic trading across the border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic,
which share the island of Hispaniola. The Dominican government has said it
will reinforce military patrols at the border, but businessmen in Santo
Domingo, the capital, said yesterday that this might not be enough to
prevent some soldiers and other smugglers from selling petrol and other
essentials to the Haitians.
Supporters of Mr Aristide say factions in the military have plotted the
murder of several prominent Haitians, including Aristide supporters and
members of the civilian government, to frustrate further the return of Mr
Aristide.
The claim gained currency following the murder last month of Mr Antoine
Izmery, a businessman and supporter of Mr Aristide, and that of Mr Malary
last week.
Likely targets of the campaign are reported to be Mr Robert Malval, the
prime minister, and Mr Evans Paul, the mayor of Port-au-Prince and a
supporter of Mr Aristide.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Hungary's privatisation falters after flying start
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK CLEGG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nicholas Clegg was the winner of the 1993 David Thomas Prize set up in
memory of David Thomas, a Financial Times journalist killed on assignment in
Kuwait in 1991. This article is part of his research, undertaken with the
prize money, into the way in which Hungary has tackled economic reform since
leaping from the communist era of command economics.
HUNGARY'S economy, partially liberated by a series of pre-1989 reforms,
leapt from the era of command economics with a significant headstart over
its post-communist neighbours. As Poland's fragile government coalitions
repeatedly collapsed and as the 'velvet divorce' sundered Czechoslovakia in
two, the manner of Hungary's move to democratic government also confirmed
its stable political credentials. Foreign investors have given their stamp
of approval by devoting to Hungary around a half of the total investment
which has flowed into central and eastern Europe since the collapse of the
Berlin Wall.
The government, believing that the foreign bounty would continue, came to
depend on foreign capital in its privatisation strategy. Last year alone,
almost 60 per cent of privatisation revenues came from abroad. Suggestions
that Hungary may need to follow a Polish or Czech style Mass Privatisation
Programme, where ownership is distributed directly to citizens at little
charge by way of coupons or vouchers, were consistently dismissed as
irrelevant to the needs of Hungary's developed economy, and unnecessary in
its open and cosmopolitan culture.
Now, however, it seems as if this virtuous cycle of domestic stability and
foreign support may be faltering seriously. As the remaining top-rank
companies are snapped up and investors are drawn to the size of neighbouring
markets - Poland alone has four times as many consumers - and to the
comparatively low-risk privatisations taking place in western countries such
as France and Italy, the pace of continued foreign investment is flattening
out, in spite of expected heavy inflows for telecommunication privatisation.
Voices are already being raised in disillusion. 'Our dream has been
disappointed,' says Andras Giday of the Institute of Privatisation Studies
in Budapest. 'The promise of foreign investment has not been fulfilled.'
At the same time, changes in the domestic political scene have led to an
increasingly chaotic approach to privatisation, confusing both domestic and
foreign investors and threatening the pace of continued reform. The
governing centre-right coalition has split, the opposition Socialist party
and Young Democrats are streaking ahead in opinion polls and the government,
perceived as inept and even corrupt by the electorate, is facing probable
defeat in next year's elections.
The government, pandering to a perceived hostility to foreign ownership
amongst the electorate, has launched a volley of new privatisation
initiatives designed to increase domestic ownership. Lajos Csepi, head of
the State Property Agency, the government body responsible for
privatisation, has taken to publicly stressing the SPA's commitment to the
creation of a broad property-owning middle class. 'Over the last year our
agenda has been dominated by the need to accelerate the process and to
increase Hungarian participation,' says Erszebet Lukacs, a director at the
SPA.
The new initiatives, however, designed for domestic political consumption
rather than as part of a serious strategy of mass privatisation, are too
small to provide a significant boost to the pace of privatisation. The
government's goal to privatise half of all state holdings by the beginning
of the year now looks utopian. According to the State Property Agency
itself, no more than 15-20 per cent has passed into private hands. Some
estimates predict that by 1995 companies representing around 30-40 per cent
of GDP will still be in majority government hands.
Foreign investment, despite the new rhetoric, is still regarded as the main
motor of privatisation. But if foreign investment flows are set to fall, how
will acceleration be achieved? For how long will Hungary be able to resist
the move towards a bolder domestic approach, perhaps emulating the Polish
and Czech mass distribution schemes? Significantly, Poland's new left of
centre coalition government has confirmed its determination to press ahead
with the foreign-managed Polish scheme.
The Hungarian government's policy changes have come in various forms:
State participation. One of the most significant occurred towards the end of
last year when a State Asset Management Company (AVRT), with control over
162 strategic companies in sectors such as energy and telecommunications,
was formed. The rationale was that these companies, crucial to the national
interest, should be properly restructured with continued state
participation. The move was also widely regarded as a palliative to the
supposed popular fear of foreign domination. 'It marked,' according to Erwin
Eichmann, an American-Hungarian lawyer with Shearman and Sterling in
Budapest, 'a significant move in favour of Hungarian ownership.'
Concessions. Hungarian investors have been bombarded with new concessions to
entice them into ownership. Government subsidised loans are on offer,
Ft100bn (Pounds 678m) of tradeable compensation coupons will have been
distributed by the end of the year to those who lost property under the
communists, and Hungarian managers are able to buy companies by way of a
'leasing' arrangement over a period of 10 years.
Voucher schemes. Last week the government announced its plan to offer state
shareholdings worth Ft100bn in 70 companies to small investors on
concessionary terms in an effort to broaden share ownership and speed
privatisation. It hopes to launch the programme during the first half of
next year, with help from the UK Know-How Fund. The scheme, devised by
Schroders, the UK investment bank, allows payment to be spread over five
years and requires no security beyond the purchased shares themselves.
Shares will only become tradeable once the credit is paid back. The schemes
to date have failed to engage Hungarians in significant numbers in part
because of their negligible size. Compensation notes can only be issued to a
limit of Ft5m per person and the Small Investor Shareholder Programme will
cover barely 0.75 per cent of the companies in state hands.
Most compensation note holders are old and come from rural areas and tend to
sell the notes for cash. The take-up of subsidised credits has been
disappointing and has forced the government to improve lending conditions
dramatically.
The Small Investor Shareholder Programme will need to overcome this
reticence if it is to succeed. Government surveys indicate that up to 1m
workers might participate if it includes good companies and offers generous
purchase terms. But Mihaly Csako, a sociologist and trade union activist,
says: 'Workers will think it is not worth buying second-hand Hungarian
companies offered to them through a government scheme.' Coupon holders will
be required to gamble, guessing whether the dividends of newly privatised
companies will provide enough to repay the initial government loan.
Meanwhile, foreign investors, once assured of a warm welcome, are left
guessing. 'It is no longer good enough for a foreign investor to put money
and expertise down on the table' says Eichmann. 'There's now more politics
to deal with.' In the government's 1992 privatisation guidelines it was
stipulated that a Hungarian bidder 'must' be preferred if the offer is an
exact match of its foreign rival.
There have already been cases where foreign bidders have lost to smaller
Hungarian competitors. The multinational giant United Distillers, despite
all expectations, for instance, lost the Hungarian liquor company Buliv to
Zwack, a diminutive Hungarian rival.
The government has even launched a 'review' of some of the early unregulated
privatisations. 'This is dangerous and unnecessary,' says Miklos Szanyi of
the Institute for World Economy. 'It sends out entirely the wrong signal to
foreign investors, that we're going backwards.' Partly to counter this
impression the government earlier this month set up an investment promotion
agency.
Reasons for the government's assumption that there is domestic anxiety about
foreign commercial interests are not difficult to find. Before the
establishment of the State Property Agency in 1990 the process of selling
state assets was largely uncontrolled and abuses soon appeared. Foreign
investors have been accused of cynically buying into Hungary to close down
local competition. There have even been two cases where foreign owners,
alleged to be corrupt, were rejected by Hungarian workers. Yet, in
developing the quasi-populist privatisation initiatives, the government may
be making inaccurate assumptions about public opinion. However negatively
foreign investors are portrayed, the evidence that Hungarians are keen to
reject foreign interests or assume the responsibilities of ownership
themselves is unclear.
Opinion polls on privatisation yield complex, even contradictory, results.
Median, a leading Hungarian independent opinion poll company, recently
conducted a confidential survey for the Alliance of Free Democrats, an
opposition party, about public attitudes towards economic reforms. With a
steady three-way split between those who think that privatisation should be
accelerated, slowed or halted, it shows that attitudes towards privatisation
are ambiguous and highlights the reticence behind the patchy domestic
response to the government's new initiatives.
As for organised opposition to foreign ownership, it is non-existent. 'All
the big trade unions are either uninterested in privatisation or they
support them as part of necessary reforms,' says Csako. 'Hostility to
privatisation is basically absent because it is still an abstraction for
most workers.'
What has changed most in the public's opinion, says Endre Hann, the director
of Median, is the attitude towards growing wealth differentials and
corruption. 'It is a typical reaction in times of transition,' says Hann.
'The egalitarian ethic is the strongest surviving value from the communist
era. People feel very insecure about the changes and increasingly resent the
new wealth and corruption though they still want the benefits of a consumer
society.'
In a country in which corruption has long been associated with the state,
and in which a suspicious hostility to the new-found wealth of the
ex-Communist managerial class is acute, it is the perceived government
mismanagement of the process that is the focus of attention.
The government, however, has moved at a glacial pace to avoid suspicions of
political collusion. The power of government patronage to positions on the
boards of privatised companies with reduced state holdings continues
unchanged. The controversy earlier this year about the way in which a
defector from the Free Alliance opposition to the government was rewarded
with a position on the board of a privatised carpet factory in Sopron is
typical. The secretive workings of the SPA have not helped either.
Unsurprisingly, opposition MPs are quick to highlight a lack of
transparency. 'We need to make the rules of the game clear,' says Balint
Magyar, a leading opposition MP.
Far from rejuvenating the privatisation process, government policy seems to
be leading to confusion among foreign investors, suspicion among domestic
investors and a failure to address the real sources of popular discontent
such as political patronage. It has also done little to accelerate the
privatisation process. As the Hungarian economy sours  - GDP could fall by
as much as 3 per cent this year, inflation is still over 20 per cent, the
budget deficit is 6.8 per cent of GDP - the need for clarity is urgent.
A bolder and more schematic approach, however, is not contemplated even by
the government's critics. The liberal opposition parties, the Alliance of
Free Democrats and the Federation of Young Democrats, hope to accelerate the
process through the expansion of existing domestic schemes and by way of
further foreign investment. The Socialists, leading strongly in opinion
polls, simply stress the need to focus on restructuring prior to
privatisation.
A Mass Privatisation Programme is still regarded as a crude attempt at
'popular capitalism'. 'It doesn't address the central problem of ownership
control over management and it doesn't bring in new capital,' says Szanyi,
voicing a familiar refrain. The Czech experience, in which privatised assets
have been concentrated in the hands of investment funds promising to buy
vouchers from Czech citizens up to 10 times their nominal value, is regarded
with deep scepticism.
The uncertainties and risks involved in Mass Privatisation Programmes
certainly warrant some caution. There is clearly no guarantee that a robust
property-owning class can be successfully forged in the absence of
substantial domestic capital resources.
However, as credit-starved companies languish in state control, as foreign
investment flows decline and as domestic political tensions rise, Hungary
may find itself obliged to join its neighbours in launching some form of
Mass Privatisation Programme. Giving a stake to each individual could cut
through the reticence of the Hungarian population about privatisation and
offer a real choice between domestic and foreign ownership.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Germany rebuts criticism of its waste recycling laws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY yesterday defended its controversial waste recycling legislation,
calling criticism from other EC states 'one-sided'. Strict German recycling
laws have been attacked for producing more waste packaging than the country
can process, resulting in large exports of waste paper and plastic.
Britain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Spain have
all complained that their young recycling industries are being so
overwhelmed by subsidised German exports that domestic waste no longer has
an outlet.
Mr Clemens Stroetmann, state secretary in the German Environment Ministry,
told an FT conference in London on international packaging and the
environment that the criticism failed to take account of imports of raw
materials into Germany. The country used around 16m tonnes of paper a year,
of which more than 8m tonnes were imported. 'It is almost impossible to
ensure the environmentally-sound disposal of used paper levels in Germany
using our own national capacity alone.'
He denied that the export of valuable waste raw material was subsidised,
either by municipal authorities or by the financially troubled national
recycling scheme, DSD.
'Valuable raw materials are collected in a system financed by ordinary
citizens, either in the form of refuse charges to the municipal authorities
or in the prices of the products they buy, which of course also reflect the
costs of the green dot (the DSD system). This financing, however, is for
actual services, the setting-up and operation of collection systems,' he
said.
The recycling scheme came under attack from Mr David Veitch, vice-president
of public affairs for Procter &amp; Gamble Europe, who said waste packaging
legislation 'leads all too easily to net extra cost', as was the case with
DSD. New national packaging legislation risked undoing the benefits of the
single market.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Italian leader acts over state security
</HEADLINE>

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Oscar Luigi Scalfaro took the unprecedented step last night of
calling a special meeting of ministers and senior officials responsible for
Italian state security to clarify the role of the intelligence services in a
series of ill-explained incidents dating back to the 1970s.
His initiative highlights his concern about a spate of recent reports
linking the intelligence services with attempts to destabilise Italian
democracy.
Some of these reports, if true, would confirm the long-held suspicion that
some security services members have been linked to organised crime.
Other reports appear designed to mislead and contain a whiff of farce. The
self-proclaimed former mistress of General Franco Monticone, head of Italy's
rapid intervention force, has talked of dissident members of the military
preparing a coup for next spring. She also claims to have met three months
ago Mr Gianni Nardi, a well-known neo-fascist killed in a car crash in
Majorca 17 years ago.
Apart from the prime minister, those called to the meeting included the
defence, interior and finance ministers, the head of the joint chiefs of
staff, leaders of the three services, plus the heads of the police, the
carabinieri, and of domestic and military intelligence.
Mr Scalfaro was expected to issue a strong call to order and for a speedy
clean-up of the intelligence services. He was also likely to warn the
military to stay out of politics following the controversy caused by a
senior general this month attacking those who backed the populist Lombard
League.
The government promised a shake-up of domestic intelligence in May following
car bombings in Rome and Florence. Then, the Interior Ministry suspected
organised crime and some members of the intelligence services were
responsible. This suspicion was repeated after car bombs in Rome and Milan
on July 28 and when the telephones failed mysteriously in the prime
minister's office for three hours.
But the shake-up has been slow in the face of the evidence. Last December,
Mr Bruno Contrada, the number three in domestic intelligence, was arrested
and charged with colluding with the Mafia. Allegations of links with
organised crime were made against General Francesco Delfino, a key figure in
the carabinieri.
Within the past six months at least 14 senior members of the domestic
intelligence service have been arrested on charges of diverting L14bn
(Pounds 5.8m) to their private use. Then last week, Mr Augusto Maria
Cittani, the agency's head, was arrested for allegedly ordering the planting
of explosives on a train.
Earlier this month the Defence Ministry announced the retirement of some 300
of the 1,500 officials in military intelligence.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Ciller means business on state asset sales: Turkey's PM has
staked a lot on privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE success or failure of Mrs Tansu Ciller's promise to drive down inflation
and stabilise the Turkish economy hinges in large part on the prime
minister's radical privatisation plans.
With her True Path party (DYP) facing a leadership congress next month and
with nationwide municipal elections in March, she is badly in need of some
quick results.
Little has happened since privatisation was first set in motion in the
mid-1980s, when minority stakes were sold in several state enterprises. Mrs
Ciller's government wants to speed up the sale of the large state
corporations and to sell majority holdings.
Strong economic growth, and a decisive political lead on the issue, is
raising hopes that Turkey may now be about to address the problems of a
state sector that comprises some 240 companies and absorbs about 30 per cent
of Turkey's fixed capital investment.
Mrs Ciller, an academic economist who entered parliament in 1991, is staking
her political reputation on scaling back the state sector. This, she
believes, is the only way to curb Turkey's 70 per cent inflation, the issue
on which the next election is certain to be fought.
The relaunch of the privatisation programme reflects mounting budget
worries, but also concern that Turkey could lose out if a spate of asset
sales across Europe soaks up international investor demand.
Mrs Ciller has still to convince her coalition partners, the Social
Democratic Populists (SHP), some of whom still appear attached to the
statist economic principles on which their party was founded. But as long as
her public support continues, her advisers believe privatisation could
acquire an unstoppable momentum, if she can just pull off one or two big
sales in the next few months.
The broad objective is to reduce the burden on the budget, free up
government resources, promote new efficiences in the economy and give a
leg-up to the capital markets. Turkey is pursuing a twin track strategy: the
immediate sale of some of the better state concerns such as
telecommunications and the petrol sector, and the introduction of the legal
and social infrastructure necessary for disposing of big loss-makers such as
the Zonguldak coal mining corporation.
After relying largely on homegrown advice, Ankara is turning to foreign
expertise. The World Bank, which sent a privatisation team to Turkey in
August, is considering financial assistance for the creation of a social
safety net, without which the large job losses associated with privatisation
would be politically difficult.
Mrs Ciller has warned of closures and redundancies. But given the current
growth rate - gross national product rose by 12 per cent in the second
quarter compared with the same period last year - Turkey should be able to
absorb the job losses.
Not everything is going her way, however. She faces union opposition because
of feared unemployment and resistance from the industrial ministries for
whom continued control over state companies is an important lever of
patronage.
Her opponents already claim one scalp. Special decree powers granted to
government in June and which have been used to bypass parliament on key
economic legislation, have been overruled by the constitutional court.
The ruling is not itself retroactive, and therefore should not affect the
decree splitting up the PTT postal and telecommunications monopoly to allow
the more profitable telecoms arm to be sold. However it could slow reform.
In addition to telecommunications, the state assets on offer include oil
refining and distribution, steel, and trade and banking operations. Many of
the companies are considered eminently saleable. The Eregli works on the
Black Sea must be one of the few steel operations in Europe reporting
increased profits.
The telecoms enterprise is making healthy profits, and is described by an
industry observer as 'one of the best prospects of any privatised telecoms
company in Europe'.
Mrs Ciller has also split off the banking arms of both Etibank, the minerals
conglomerate, and Sumerbank, the retail and textile giant. The liabilities
of Sumerbank's 46 banking branches have been taken over by the state-owned
Halk Bank; shares in its retail outlets are being distributed to employees.
The appointment of foreign consultants underlines the urgency being given to
the programme. Lehman Brothers of the US and J Henry Schroder Wagg of the
UK, in partnership with two local banks, are selling the government stake in
Tofas, the local Fiat car assembler, in what would be the biggest ever
international offering by a Turkish company.
Separately, talks are continuing to appoint advisers on the two principal
privatisations - that of the PTT, and of the Tupras oil refinery, which is
to be sold together with Petrol Ofisi, the retail and distribution
operations.
The planned sale of 20 per cent of the telephone monopoly is expected to
realise close to Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn). For the petroleum sector,
offers have been submitted from eight bank groups, including Samuel Montagu,
Chase Manhattan, and Kleinwort Benson. Brokers say the government is looking
at the sale of two refineries and the PO retail outlets. However, officials
say there is unlikely to be much interest in a portfolio holding unless the
buyer has control over brands and assets.
Ultimately, with other countries also unveiling privatisation plans, it is
not just Turkey's disgruntled politicians Mrs Ciller has to convince. She
must also assure foreign banks that this time Turkey means business on
privatisation.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Bonn savings face cities with 'financial disaster'

MORE than 1,000 mayors, lord mayors and council leaders from towns and
cities throughout Germany descended on Bonn yesterday to protest at
government savings plans, which they claim are driving them to financial
disaster.
They warned of drastic cuts in spending on libraries, youth and sports clubs
and theatres, which German citizens have come to take for granted.
The representatives of more than 7,000 towns and cities, with a combined
population of more than 50m, called on the government to rethink its plans
for cuts in social spending, which will transfer costs of up to DM6bn
(Pounds 2.4bn) a year by 1996 on to local budgets.
Mr Norbert Burger, lord mayor of Cologne, and president of the standing
conference of German municipal authorities, charged the government with
precipitating the 'financial collapse' of many towns and cities.
Plans to cut unemployment pay and reduce the duration of benefits would
inevitably force more people on to the basic provisions of social
assistance, paid for by the local councils, he said. The only way to finance
this would be by cuts in all other municipal services.
He accused Chancellor Helmut Kohl of refusing to listen to their plight, in
spite of repeated efforts to seek a compromise. 'It is our duty to tell you
loudly and clearly: this is not the way to behave, Mr Chancellor,' Mr Burger
declared to a storm of applause.
Mr Kohl was seeking to involve city councils in special programmes to
counter violence and racism among young people, while was forcing councils
to lower spending on youth clubs and culture, he said.
At the heart of the spending crisis is the simultaneous pressure of rising
unemployment and the switch of public spending priorities from western
Germany to the new states in the east.
From the government's side, there was barely a sign of movement. Mr Horst
Waffenschmidt, state secretary in the interior ministry, was adamant that
all must cut back in the current spending squeeze.

<TEXT>
POLAND'S President Lech Walesa yesterday asked Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the
34-year-old leader of the Polish Peasant party (PSL), to form the next
government following the resignation of Ms Hanna Suchocka, the outgoing
prime minister.
The decision follows parliamentary elections on September 19, when the party
won 15 per cent of the vote and the post-communist Left Democratic Alliance
(SLD), its coalition partner, won 20 per cent. Together the two parties
control 303 seats in the 460-member parliament.
Mrs Suchocka's government will continue in a caretaker role until Mr Pawlak
forms a cabinet and it is confirmed by parliament.
Mr Pawlak is expected to complete negotiations with the Alliance on the
make-up of the next cabinet and to present the results to parliament's next
session on October 21. He will then seek parliamentary approval for his
nomination.
President Walesa has a constitutional right to oversee the posts of minister
of interior, defence and foreign affairs and is thought to have won
assurances in the weeks since the election that his candidates will be
nominated in these ministries. These are thought to include Mr Andrzej
Olechowski, a former finance minister as foreign minister, and Mr Andrzej
Milczanowski, the incumbent as interior minister.
For the rest, the PSL wants to have one of its members controlling one of
the government's economic posts, which include finance, trade and industry,
foreign trade or privatisation, leaving the SLD with the rest. Mr Walesa had
expressed doubts about Mr Pawlak's ability to govern with what the president
sees as an unbalanced and unstable parliament.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Russian alliances form ahead of polls: The imminence of
elections prompts a scramble to line up party support

<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S politicians are scrambling for alliances ahead of December's
parliamentary elections whose outcome will be determined by access to the
media, support from business, and the heavy hand of the government.
Reformers in the Russian government, members of which are allowed to run for
parliament while preserving ministerial posts, have already produced two
competing alliances through which they hope to produce a reform-minded
parliament.
The bulk of the cabinet has swung its weight behind Russia's Choice, led by
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister responsible for the
economy. He is promising more radical reform.
But two young deputy prime ministers associated with the reforms of the past
two years - Mr Sergei Shakhrai, responsible for regional issues, and Mr
Alexander Shokhin, who looks after foreign economic relations - have broken
away to form a Russian Party of Unity and Agreement. They are advocating
more gradual market reform and greater autonomy for Russia's restless
regions.
There is little to distinguish this party's aims from a third alliance being
organised by Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, the prominent economist who wants to
become Russia's next president. The main difference is the latter's
independence from the government.
Another independent group, which is closer to the radical economic platform
of Russia's Choice, has been established by Mr Konstantin Borovoi, a
prominent entrepreneur and founder of the Economic Freedom Party. But he has
refused to join Russia's Choice, describing it as 'a criminal restoration of
the idea of a ruling party like the communist party once was'.
Most Russian businessmen, who are the main source of independent finance for
this campaign, are still busy shopping around for their best buy, with some
inclined to support several groups, just to be on the safe side.
As an aide to Mr Shakhrai puts it: 'There is a sort of competition now
between businesses to give money to parties. Many are helping all the
democratic parties, hoping they will get someone of their calling elected.'
Still unclear are the plans of the leaders of the so-called 'centre', who
have been tainted by their past alliance with former Vice-President
Alexander Rutskoi. They are well-known figures such as Mr Yuri Skokov,
former chief of the Russian Security Council, and Mr Arkady Volsky, head of
an important industrialists union. Mr Volsky is today expected to announce
an alliance with radicals such as Mr Anatoly Sobchak, mayor of St
Petersburg, and Mr Gavriil Popov, Moscow's ex-mayor.
One such alliance of odd bed-fellows was formed only yesterday, uniting Mr
Victor Aksiuchits, who heads a Russian christian democratic movement, and Mr
Valery Zorkin, who was forced to resign as head of Russia's the
constitutional court.
A key test of the elections' legitimacy will be access to forces associated
with the old parliament so that they are not driven underground and the new
state duma's legitimacy is recognised by all.
The acknowledged leader of what is left of the Communist movement is Mr
Gennady Ziuganov, a moderate who was not involved in parliament's armed
uprising.
His Russian Communist party is expected to team up with the Russian Workers
party, headed by Mr Roy Medvedev, a once-dissident Communist historian, and
the Agrarian party, which has the support of Russia's powerful state farm
lobby.
The main leader of the hardline nationalist movement is Mr Sergei Baburin,
who unlike many colleagues who remained in the White House until the bitter
end, has not been arrested and has every intention of running for
parliament.
The main handicap of the Communists and hardline nationalists - as
illustrated by the banning of a Baburin news conference by a compliant
International Press Club - will be limited access to the media.
The government has already closed the television programme 600 Seconds and
hardline newspapers for instigating violence and anti-Semitism. It is also
taking control of other media.
Mr Mikhail Poltoranin, President Yeltsin's aide for the media, announced
plans at the weekend to switch 2,400 local newspapers financed by the
councils to 'democratic' forces - a euphemism which can only mean local
administrations controlled by Mr Yeltsin.

FT  19 OCT 93 / EC delay on ending passport checks
</HEADLINE>

   By DAVID BUCHAN

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS of the nine European Community signatories to the Schengen free
travel pact yesterday agreed to delay removing systematic passport checks
until February 1, chiefly because of technical problems on a police
computer.
Mr Alain Lamassoure, France's EC affairs minister, who chaired the meeting
in Paris, played down the two-month delay from the December 1 deadline which
the Schengen signatories set earlier this year for ending routine controls
on people travelling between their countries. 'February 1 is virtually
tomorrow, and there is nothing to stop preparatory measures coming into
effect on December 1,' he said.
But the minister admitted that internal French problems over political
asylum were another cause for delay. One of the Schengen arrangements
provides that, as a general rule, asylum-seekers can only apply for refuge
in one state.
France's top court ruled in August that this infringed asylum rights
enshrined in the constitution. However, the president and prime minister
agreed on a compromise which has yet to be put in place.
France, Germany and the Benelux countries signed the agreement in 1990, and
Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece have subsequently signed.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FORCES fighting for the return to power of the former Georgian president, Mr
Zviad Gamsakhurdia, have advanced rapidly to within 20km of Kutaisi, the
country's second city, with a population of 300,000.
It is the last centre in western Georgia still in the hands of the Georgian
government headed by Mr Eduard Shevardnadze. Mr Shevardnadze said in a
broadcast yesterday that his army 'has practically disintegrated'.
His senior ministers have been negotiating with Russian officials, and
unconfirmed reports say Russia has agreed to supply advanced military
technology to defend Kutaisi, including heavy artillery.
In an interview with the Financial Times at his base in Zugdidi in the west
of the country, Mr Gamsakhurdia said that 'this conflict will be settled and
Georgia will be cleansed of them (Mr Shevardnadze's supporters)'. Mr
Gamsakhurdia, who was deposed in a coup in January 1992, said he would
resume his 'lawful presidency' by 'all possible means'.
Early on Sunday morning, after it was clear the rapid military assault was
succeeding, Mr Loti Kobalia, Mr Gamsakhurdia's military commander, stood on
the balcony of the building occupied by the former president and whipped up
his supporters to frenzied cheering as he shouted: 'Victory is ours. . .
soon we will be in Kutaisi.'
Mr Gamsakhurdia, who has been in Georgia for one month after almost two
years' exile in the north Caucasian Russian republic of Chechnya, ruled out
negotiations with Mr Shevardnadze or any of his associates.
He said that Mr Jaba Josseliani, leader of the Mekhedrioni group of
irregular forces and effectively Georgia's chief-of-staff, was 'a four times
convicted criminal. . . He will make an agreement and break it at once.'
Mr Gamsakhurdia denies that he is prosecuting a civil war.
'You must not call it a civil war, it is a fight against criminal gangs,' he
said.
The former president's refusal to negotiate and the higher morale of his
forces, which are estimated to number about 10,000, means the country of
5.5m people now faces the prospect of a longer and more intense conflict.
Already Mr Vladizlav Ardzinba, leader of the Abkhazian separatists, has said
his republic will be an independent state equal to Russia and Georgia. Its
borders would be between the rivers Psou in the north and Incuri in the
south, cutting off around 15 per cent of former Georgian territory.
The offensive by Mr Gamsakhurdia's forces overran the rail junction of
Samtredia and the town of Khoni on Sunday after a few hours' resistance from
the scattered defenders. Their advance of some 25km towards Kutaisi
demonstrates the weakness of the Georgian forces which, apart from the
Mekhedrioni irregulars, are composed of national guardsmen and militia.

FT  19 OCT 93 / London commuters hit by 6% rise in rail and Tube fares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAVELLERS face fare increases in the new year averaging 6 per cent on
London Transport, Network SouthEast and Scotrail services - but most
InterCity ticket prices will remain the same, it was announced yesterday.
After pressure from Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, plans for
double-figure rises - outlined in British Rail documents leaked this summer
 -were all but abandoned by operators.
The increases are three times the rate of retail price inflation and will
affect London commuters particularly hard.
The cost of the capital's popular, unlimited-use Travelcards will rise by up
to 10 per cent as London Transport attempts to bring them closer to their
travel value. A weekly one-zone Travelcard will cost Pounds 10.20 next
January, compared with Pounds 9.30 previously. A two-zone underground
journey will rise by 10p to Pounds 1.30.
Network SouthEast - which was earlier rumoured to be planning increases of
up to 16 per cent - responded to government pressure to keep its average
fare rises well below double figures.
The average rise for season tickets on most of the network's routes will be
6 per cent, but higher on better-performing lines such as Chiltern and West
Anglia. Following Citizen's Charter policy, the network's rises on
poorer-performing Kent Coast and Thames routes will be lower, at 3 per cent.
Off-peak fares will rise by 4 per cent.
Mr John Nelson, the network's managing director, emphasised that the average
rise would not be enough to overcome the 'very serious financial situation'
stemming from the 100,000 fall in the number of BR commuters and a drop in
property sales.
InterCity, which receives no subsidy, increased only its standard open
ticket fares by an average of 3 per cent.
Passenger groups criticised the fare rises for outstripping inflation and
the government for failing to deliver enough funding.
The London Regional Passengers' Committee said the government had placed BR
and LT in an 'impossible position' by depriving them of funds and of powers
to impose higher fare increases. It called on the government to allocate
sufficient funds in the November Budget to enable BR and LT to maintain
their transport systems and operate them safely.
Mr Michael Patterson, secretary of the Central Transport Consultative
Committee, the rail users' watchdog, said: 'Increases on some lines of up to
four times the rate of inflation are unprecedented and this will do nothing
to reverse the huge drop in rail commuting over recent years.'

FT  19 OCT 93 / Navy yards to be sold in defence savings drive: All-party
committee warns on danger of further cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT plans to sell the navy dockyards at Devonport and Rosyth to
the private sector by 1996 as part of a drive for defence savings.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, announced yesterday that tenders for
the two refitting yards, currently run by private companies under contract,
would be invited early next year.
He also confirmed that the government was abandoning plans for an
air-launched nuclear missile for the Royal Air Force. However, in the midst
of a growing row about expenditure cuts, officials made clear that neither
measure would bring early savings to the defence budget.
Mr Rifkind's announcements at the start of a two-day Commons defence debate
coincided with a strong warning from the all-party defence committee about
the impact of further cuts.
A committee report said the armed forces' capabilities would be reduced to
'below the minimum necessary for the security of the UK'. Sir Nicholas
Bonsor, its Tory chairman, said there was no room for more reductions.
The warning came as Mr Rifkind remained locked in a cabinet battle to fend
off Treasury demands for billions of pounds worth of spending cuts during
the second half of the 1990s.
Backed by warnings from senior Tory MPs about the dangers of further cuts,
Mr Rifkind said that provision of sufficient resources was 'fundamental' to
confidence in the armed forces. He told the Commons 'arbitrary' cuts in
defence spending would undermine Britain's ability to meet its security
commitments.
Earlier a ministerial meeting chaired by Mr John Major, the prime minister,
failed to bridge the gap between the Treasury and the Ministry of Defence
despite the mediation of Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary.
Mr Rifkind has demanded a full-scale review of all of Britain's military
commitments as the price for any significant cuts in his Pounds 24bn budget.
But Mr Major is concerned that such a review would provoke a storm of
criticism from backbench MPs and Conservative supporters.
Ministers said that the main battle focused on Mr Rifkind's budget for the
1996-97 financial year, which would provide the effective baseline for
defence spending into the next century. The Treasury and MoD were said to be
'billions of pounds apart'.
Cancellation of the missile plan had been expected due to a reduced need for
nuclear weapons. Defence officials said a 'notional' provision of Pounds
1.8bn had been made for the missile and its warhead in future budget plans,
but the anticipated expenditure was some years away.
Instead of an air-launched weapon, Britain will use its Trident submarine
missiles both as a strategic and as a more limited sub-strategic weapon.
Officials said the Trident could be adapted to the sub-strategic role for
'almost nothing'. However, they said the government would maintain the
Atomic Weapons Establishment's capacity to design and produce warheads.
The move to outright privatisation of the dockyards follows the government's
controversial decision in June to carry out all navy submarine refits at
Devonport.
It aims to transfer ownership of the two yards to separate bidders in order
to maintain competition. But Mr Rifkind said yesterday the government was
committed to a 'substantial programme' of allocated work for Rosyth.

FT  19 OCT 93 / George Michael's counsel sings the Sony blues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Justice Jonathan Parker is not the sort of judge who asks: 'Who is George
Michael?'
First, because the singer was sitting in front of him in the High Court in
London yesterday, clad in black T-shirt, black suit and designer stubble,
listening to his counsel argue that his contract with Sony should be
declared unenforceable.
Second, Mr Justice Parker, 55, would not play the game. Mr Mark Cran QC,
George Michael's lawyer, came up with enough pop icons to stump a dozen high
court judges, but Mr Justice Parker nodded knowingly. Madonna, Elton John,
even Holly Johnson of Frankie Goes to Hollywood - he knew them all.
Mr Cran said the singer's last few years had not been easy. His contract has
not made him as rich as some people thought.
In the five years to the end of 1992, George Michael's gross profits were a
mere Pounds 7.35m. Sony's gross profits from his recordings for the same
period were Pounds 52.45m.
The singer's profits were calculated after he had met recording costs
himself, as required by his contract, but before he had paid his
accountants, or - Mr Cran expressed regret - his lawyers.
George Michael had four barristers to represent him, including two QCs. The
second QC was Mr Jeremy Lever, who had come to argue that the contract was
in breach of European competition law and should be declared void. This
would result in the copyright to George Michael's songs being returned to
him. Time ran out before Mr Lever's turn came, so he spent the day puffing
on his Biro as if it were a stress-reducing accessory.
Mr Cran's job was to argue that the contract represented an unreasonable
restraint of trade and should be declared unenforceable. Its duration was
particularly onerous. Although it ends, in theory, in 2003, Mr Cran argued
that it could continue for longer, as George Michael would be liable for
damages if he had not delivered the six albums still required by his
contract.
An additional injustice was that Sony could reject albums if it was
dissatisfied with their contents. Mr Cran said this gave Sony the right to
make a subjective decision about artistic quality. It would be difficult for
a court to question that judgment. 'That's very true,' Mr Justice Parker
said, acknowledging a rare musical limitation.
George Michael had decided he wanted to be a serious musician rather than a
sex symbol. Sony had not given him support.
His fans did, though. Dewy-eyed, they sat in the public gallery, one in a
recklessly low-cut blouse, ready to endure hours of argument for their
serious musician. Most did not budge as Mr Cran explained the workings of
withholding tax.
The few who left paused to bestow upon their idol a look of tender
solicitude. As well they might; the case is likely to continue for 12 weeks.

FT  19 OCT 93 / Retail survey adds to fears of slowdown in recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kenneth Clarke's Budget dilemma over taxation and the public finances has
been heightened by a cautious report on retail trading from the
Confederation of British Industry today and a gloomy Gallup survey, pointing
to weakening consumer confidence.
The two reports, which give new impetus to fears that Britain's recovery may
be losing steam on a broad front, come as the chancellor will today face
calls from cabinet colleagues to avoid jeopardising economic growth by
imposing large tax increases in next month's Budget.
But a full-scale cabinet debate of the options for November 30 will also
hear a warning from Mr Clarke that the government's borrowing requirement is
still on course to reach a record Pounds 50bn this year.
In its latest monthly survey of distributive trades, the CBI reports that
retail sales rose in the year to September, but the growth was slower than
in the preceding three months and disappointed traders' expectations.
Gallup said yesterday its latest consumer confidence survey, conducted in
the first 12 days of this month on behalf of the European Commission, found
'a severe decline' in the public's assessment of Britain's economic
performance and increased pessimism 'on almost every economic indicator'.
Together the surveys suggest Britain's recovery could be faltering in the
high street as well as in the factories. After last week's figures showing
falling manufacturing output and rising inflation during the summer, they
cast doubt on the underlying strength of UK consumer demand.
Official figures yesterday showed that Mr Clarke's budgetary problems are as
intractable as ever: Britain's public sector borrowing requirement increased
to Pounds 5.88bn in September from Pounds 4.01bn in September last year.
The budget deficit of Pounds 24.2bn in the first six months of the current
financial year did little to support the view of some City commentators that
the PSBR in 1993-94 would be significantly below the Pounds 50bn forecast by
the government in March. However, the recent bad economic news found no echo
in UK equity markets where hopes of lower interest rates around the time of
the Budget and strong gains in Hong Kong and continental European markets
pushed the FT-SE 100 index to an all-time closing high of 3,167.6, up 16.8.
Expectations of a Budget-time cut in interest rates also affected sterling.
It lost  1/2 pfennig from Friday to close at DM2.4375 in London and dropped
nearly 1 1/2 cents to close at Dollars 1.4980. In New York, sterling
weakened just over 2 cents against the dollar, closing at Dollars 1.4867,
and finished the day at DM2.4378. The Bank of England's trade weighted
sterling index was 79.9 at yesterday's close against 80.3 on Friday.
The CBI says last month's slower growth in retail sales was offset by a
strong growth in wholesale turnover and growth of sales in line with
expectations in the motor trade. The report says all three groups expect
further year-on-year growth in sales this month.
However, Mr Nigel Whittaker, the chairman of the CBI's distributive trades
panel, notes that retailers' expectations have been over-optimistic in five
of the past six months.
The survey's findings suggests that 'the upturn in high street demand
remains fragile', Mr Whittaker says.
Yesterday, one senior minister said unless the economy showed stronger signs
of growth additional tax rises of more than Pounds 2bn or Pounds 3bn would
risk a backlash from Conservative MPs.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (22): Integration
is the key - Paul Taylor examines developments in private network systems
and services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIBERALISATION of telecommunications regimes has accelerated the pace of
change in the provision of private network systems and services.
At the same time, new technologies are being developed and many companies
are considering alternatives to building, operating and maintaining their
own dedicated networks.
The market at stake is huge. According to some estimates the combined
European telecoms equipment and services market will be worth Dollars 200bn
by 1996, (see pages 14 and 15 of this survey).
The world market equipment alone amounts to Dollars 128bn a year, with the
US accounting for Dollars 44.8bn (35 per cent), and the EC for Dollars
30.7bn (24 per cent) - and within these totals the market for private branch
exchanges (PBXs) remains one of the largest sectors.
However, the advent of digital technology and the new rules of competition
have created a much wider range of network equipment, service and supplier
options. Customers no longer have to accept separate and inflexible
approaches to their voice and data transmission requirements.
Today's corporate network needs to be flexible, upgrade- able and expandable
in order to accommodate the changing demands which are likely to be placed
on it. The network may well be a hybrid, using private point-to-point links
for steady high-volume and high-security traffic and dial-up bandwidth
services to cope with traffic peaks and special requirements.
Increasingly, it needs to support integrated voice and data communications
as well as new applications, such as video-conferencing.
This requirement for integration poses a challenge for the traditional
private network and the manufacturers of PBX equipment, in particular. As
the New Jersey-based Insight Research group noted in a recent report, the
PBX industry 'is at a crossroads.' After three years, during which almost
all PBX suppliers made losses Insight suggests that 'two major obstacles
confront the entire industry' - how to make money, and how to re-ignite the
enthusiasm the PBX industry enjoyed in the early 1980s.
In particular, Insight warns that PBX manufacturers face a challenge from
data communications equipment vendors who are begining to offer their local
area network (Lan) customers true voice and data integration products.
This challenge will be re-inforced by emerging new technologies like ATM
(Asynchronous Transfer Mode), which combines the best features of
multiplexing and cell switching to mix high-speed voice, data and video
traffic, and Frame relay which uses high-speed packet switching technology
to handle data traffic between sites.
However, perhaps the biggest change under way is the move towards managed
network services (MNS), virtual private networks (VPNs) and
'outsourcing,'(see page 7 in this survey).
Beginning in the 1970s, many large companies built their own dedicated
telecommunications networks for voice and data traffic using leased lines.
But now many large customers are either asking outsiders to manage their own
internal networks and facilities, or buying-in the sophisticated network
services which they need.
This year MNS are expected to account for 16 per cent of the total European
market for Value-Added Network Services (Vans), according to Datamonitor,
the London-based technology research group, which also predicts that the
proportion will 'rise dramatically as the key product segments such as
network outsourcing grow at rates of up to 50 per cent annually for the next
few years.'
One of the most popular 'bought-in' services in the US is 'Centrex,' where
the features of a conventional company PBX - such as desk-to-desk and short
code dialing - are provided by the network operator who partitions off part
of the public telephone exchange to act as a customer's office telephone
system. The customer pays a regular fixed sum for the exchange equipment and
a variable increment based on usage, but avoids the need for substantial
capital investment.
Centrex services have proved particularly popular in the US where they have
been available since the early 1980s and where Insight Research notes they
have been actively marketed by the regional bell operating companies as a
'cost-effective, hassle-free alternative to PBXs, especially to the small
and medium-sized company that cannot afford the overhead of a dedicated
telecommunications staff.'
In the case of MNS, most - or all - of the day-to-day running of a corporate
voice or data network (Managed Data Network) is undertaken by an outside
contractor. In the UK, managed network services are also available from the
two domestic network operators as well as international competitors like
AT&amp;T of the US.
'Customers are usually looking for a long-term but flexible relationship,'
says Mr David Sexton, customer director for MNS at Mercury.
Several key factors help explain the recent rapid growth in MNS:
First: the cost of private leased circuits has been increased in recent
years as a result of tariff re-balancing in the late 1980s which changes the
economics of private networks.
Second: many customers are under-going rapid change themselves which often
requires substantial re-oganisation of telecommunications services without
disruption.
Third: technological advances means rapid change or 'churn' in customer
premises equipment.
Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) represent another, even more flexible
alternative to the private network. VPNs provide the features and
functionality of a private network based on leased circuits, with the
flexibility and security of the public switched telephone networks - on a
domestic or international basis.
This eliminates the need for continual capital investment in new technology
and means that capacity is available on demand and paid for on a usage
basis. The simplest VPN simply provides a business customer with a way to
link the switchboards on different sites - even if they are in different
countries - without having the expense of installing and running their own
private network.
More sophisticated VPNs allow customers take advantage of the embedded
intelligence in the network and, for example, 'dial-up' additional bandwidth
(line capacity) when it is required for a video-conference or to accommodate
a peak during the day in electronic mail messages. Perhaps most
significantly, a VPN can be reconfigured rapidly to meet the customer's
changing requirements.
In the US, all three long distance carriers, AT&amp;T, MCI and US Sprint,
introduced voice VPN services in the mid-1980s and almost all of the top
1,000 US companies use the service. Similarly, in the UK, the increasing
competition between Mercury and BT for big business customers has helped
stimulate interest in VPNs.
For some companies the nature of their telecom traffic may mean that they
continue to use private networks for their most sensitive data or on routes
where very high volumes of traffic are regularly transmitted, but use a
managed network or a VPN for other traffic.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (23): The shape
of things to come - Personal Numbers / One day, everyone may be given a
telecoms number at birth, as they get a national insurance number today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY THE turn of the century, business cards listing a veritable directory of
phone and fax numbers could be a thing of the past.
Instead, most business people may have just one number - a 'personal number'
connecting callers to whichever telephone, fax or messaging service its
'owner' chooses at any given time.
Eventually, everyone might get a telecoms number at birth, just as in the UK
they are given a national insurance number today, but for the foreseeable
future 'personal numbering' will be a premium-rate service, geared mainly at
companies, executives and others on the move and wanting to be contactable
anywhere, anytime.
The technology for the task is largely in place, with the development of
intelligent networks which can 'recognise' different types of call, refer to
databases, and then direct calls - and charge for them - in a pre-determined
fashion.
There is strong support for personal numbering from regulatory authorities,
which are keen to boost competition between operators to provide new
value-added services. In the UK, Oftel, the industry regulator, proposes to
devote a large block of numbers for personal numbering. Prefixed by the
digits '07', they would come on stream when the existing numbering regime is
reformed in 1995.
A recent Oftel policy statement highlighted personal numbering 'an area of
rapid growth' in the next few years. It pointed to the US, where AT&amp;T has
launched a service using '700' numbers and the Federal Communications
Commission has floated the idea that the '500' number range be generally
used for personal communications services.
The expense of the operation is widely thought to make it unviable. When
Oftel published its statement on numbering this summer, a BT spokesman
dismissed the idea as 'way, way off . . . It's like Concorde,' he said. 'You
can build it, but that doesn't mean many people will be able to afford to
fly in it.'
With a Dollars 7 a month subscription, AT&amp;T's 'EasyReach' service is not
unduly expensive. Two companies are planning to launch similar services in
the UK - Goodall Personal Numbering (GPN), which will brand a personal
numbering service under the name 'Flextel' from the end of this year; and
'Numbering Viewed Worldwide', which plans to enter the market next year.
Neither is toying with tariffs that will unduly frighten those anxious for
their services.
Goodall has two separate services in mind. First, a 'low mobility' service
geared at companies which want a single number they can keep when they move.
Second, a 'high mobility' personal number which individuals can take around
with them day by day. Numbering Viewed Worldwide will concentrate on the
second service. Mr Will Goodall, GPN's founder, believes the low mobility
services will have most impact in the short term - 'the damage done to
businesses by number changes is enormous,' he says. 'Many will be prepared
to pay a small premium for the security of being able to move all or part of
their operation around without forfeiting their number.'
He downplays the immediate potential of 'high mobility' services. 'If people
want day-by-day number portability, cellular services are doing most of the
job already,' he says.
In any case, there are serious practical difficulties in making a 'high
mobility' service viable. They are highlighted by Dr Michael Grant of
Analysys, the Cambridge-based telecoms consultancy.
The key problem is to find a quick and simple way for the 'owner' of the
database to update it with his/her movements on a day-by-day basis. AT&amp;T's
'EasyReach' relies on real-time updating, requiring users to phone a
database each time they want their number transferred - unless they follow a
pre-set daily pattern. This can be an off-putting process.
As Dr Grant says of existing solutions: 'The user is required to inform the
system of home, office and mobile telephone numbers, manage a list of
preferred and barred caller numbers, specify re-routing times, and make ad
hoc changes to the profile as the daily work pattern changes from its normal
routine.'
Moreover, 'informing the system' generally requires a phone call, the
entering of an account code and PIN number and then the number of the
terminal on which the user wishes to register.
THE search is on for new technological solutions to the problem. Dr Grant
highlights five which have potential:
Calling line identification, being introduced in many networks around the
world, which greatly reduces the time taken to register on a terminal.
The DTMF 'tone card' concept, which could automate both the dialling of the
service provider and the entering of the account number.
Voice recognition, which could be used to speed up the inter-action.
Subscriber identity module (SIM) cards - as already with phones on GSM
digital cellular networks - which could be used to separate handsets from
numbers, making all handsets docking stations for mobile terminals.
Turning phones 'on' and 'off', to give signals to the network - as, again,
do mobile phones already - as to whether the subscriber is there, and
routing calls accordingly.
Of the five, the SIM concept is the most path-breaking. Once the people, not
the phones, have the numbers, the era of mobile communications will have
truly arrived.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (21): There is no
quick financial 'fix' - Equipment supplies / There is overwhelming evidence
that high quality telecom networks are essential for economic growth in
developing countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NEWMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN a recent survey of business managers in central and eastern Europe
carried out by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development,
44 per cent of respondents said that poor quality telecommunications links
were the main barrier to exports to the west, and 53 per cent cited it as
the the biggest obstacle to exports to neigbouring countries.
Telecommunications modernisation programmes were neglected by Communist
governments and international links, in particular, were hopelessly
inadequate when eastern Europe opened to the west in 1989 and 1990.
OECD figures show a strong correlation between GDP per capita and telephone
line penetration across central and eastern Europe. GDP per capital rises by
between Dollars 600 and Dollars 1,000 for every five per cent increase in
telephone line penetration.
Improving trunk ad international telephone links was immediately a priority
for the new democracies. But finding the money to pay for new telephone
lines has been a big obstacle which telephone operators, equipment
suppliers, financiers and teams of western consultants, are struggling even
now to overcome.
When telephone operators were state-owned organisations operating under
ministerial control, financing for telecommunications development was
provided directly from state budgets.
'In the past, finance was not a serious issue for telecommunications
operators,' according to Tim Nulty, a senior World Bak economist.
'Politicians set the goals and, having done so, were obliged to provide the
finance and the necessary inputs. Managers in the telecommunications
operators had little responsibility. They merely translated the targets
'delivered from the top' into detailed programmes for installation and lists
of required inputs. It was the government's responsibility to see that the
necessary goods ad finance were available.'
But the dismantling of central planning, and the enormous investments
required to make up for the years of neglect, means that the
telecommunications operators need to look elsewhere for finance.
THE World Bank, the European Investment Bank, and the European Bank of
Reconstruction and Development, EBRD, have taken the lead in securing finace
for telecommunications projects in eastern Europe. They have raised money
for international gateways, cellular telephone networks ad digital trunk
backbone networks. All are essential for international business, but less
rewarding process of upgrading ad extending the basic telephone network has
not even started in a number of countries.
'The problem,' according to one western banker, 'is marketing projects as an
attractive investment opportunity.'
Mr Clell Harral, a deputy director for infrastructure, energy and
environment at the EBRD, says there are a number of reasons why investors
are cautious about project finance - schemes in which debt finance is
secured solely on revenues from the investment itself.
'The country risk, the foreign exchange risk and the instability of the
government regime with respect to regulatory policies, the greater
uncertainties of demand forecasts, contractual counter-party credit risks
and uncertainties regarding the enforceability of legal structures' are all
significant risks that have to be dealt with, Mr Harral says.
As a result, potential investors have shied away from project finance -
'there's been a lot of talk about project finance and not much action,'
according to one leading banker.
In eastern Europe, the EBRD is most optimistic about overcoming these
obstacles in Hungary, Poland ad the Czech Republic where telephone
operators' activities are being separated from the ministries and modest
tariff reform programmes are under way. Build-operate-transfer (BOT) project
finance, for example, 'is a serious option today' in these countries, adds
Mr Harral.
A different picture is emerging in south-east Asia where telephone operators
are finding it relatively easy to finance infrastructure projects - 'all
forms of investors are willing to invest in countries such as Thailand,
Korea and Malaysia, according to a senior economist in one commercial bank.
Equity investment, supplier finance and project finance are all available,
which means that telephone operators can go for the best deal, he adds.
One of the most imaginative financing packages was put together in Thailand
where two international consortia are installing telephone lines in Bangkok
and outlying rural areas in return for a share in line revenues.
TelecomAsia, which is majority-owned by Charoen Pokphand Group, has a
25-year build-operate-transfer agreement with the Telephone Organisation of
Thailand, to instal 2m phone lines in Bangkok. The project is being managed
by US regional telephone company, Nynex.
Japanese domestic telephone operate Nippon Telegraph and Telephone,
meanwhile, has a stake in the majority Thai-owned Thai Telephone and
Telecommunications, which has a 25-year BOT agreement to instal a million
provincial telephone lines.
The most ambitious modernisation programmes are in India and China. Ian
MacLeod, a telecommunications equipment industry analyst at Natwest Sellier
in Paris, says that China will buy 9m telephone lines in 1993.
If China meets its target of increasing telephone line penetration from two
per cent to 10 per cent by the year 2000, it will need to buy 13m lines a
year for the rest of the decade, Mr MacLeod adds.
CHINA is paying for telephone lines in hard currency out of its big trade
surplus. But it will inevitably seek to open lines of finance in north
America and western Europe, many analysts believe.
Central control of telecom operations will have to be relaxed if China wants
private investors to contribute to the modernisation programme, according to
one western banker.
'If they try to do it in a monolithic way, they wouldn't have the money nad
no one abroad will lend it to them,' he says.
'What they have to do - and what they are doing - is opening up avenues for
smaller operators.'
Similarly, India may have to reform the telecommunications sector to meet
its target of installing two million lines a year until the year 2000.
Importing telephone lines has been made easier by the willingness of leading
suppliers to accept payment in the newly-convertible rupee. They are also in
discussions about supplier finance, but this will only meet part of the
total financing requirement.
Developing countries understand the importance of telecoms to their
economies. But financing modernisation programmes is a long, arduous task.
There is no quick financial fix and developing countries will have to
continue to rely heavily on internally-generated funds from high-margin
businesses such as mobile communications and international services to
finance basic infrastructure projects.

        FINANCING TELECOMS INFRASTRUCTURE: FINANCING OPTIONS
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
The details here are from the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, EBRD. They outline the financing options at four stages of
infrastructure development. The primary source of finance must be
internal cash generation. External finance can be mobilised as follows:
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
STAGE ONE:   public telephone operator under ministry control:
             EBRD: sovereign loans.
             Private and bilateral sources: supplier and export credit.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
STAGE TWO:   separation of telecoms from other activities:
             EBRD: Sovereign loans, lender of record.
             Commercial sources of finance: syndicated loans; project
             finance.
             Private and bilateral sources: supplier and export credit.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
STAGE THREE: corporatisation:
             EBRD: non-guaranteed loans, lender of record,
             guarantees, project finance equity.
             Commercial sources of finance: syndicated loans; project
             finance.
             Private and bilateral sources: supplier and export
             credit; project finance; equity.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
STAGE FOUR:  privatisation:
             EBRD: commercial loans, underwriting, guarantees, equity.
             Commercial sources: commercial loans.
             Private and bilateral sources: supplier and export credit;
             project finance; equity.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (20): Pressure of
technological change / A look at the prospects for leading equipment
suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NEWMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Such is the buoyancy of the global telecoms industry that there is room for
the leading suppliers to continue to expand, and for new entrepreneurial
companies to break into their traditional businesses
EYEBROWS were raised when Northern Telecom announced a 26 per cent slump in
profits for the first quarter of 1993. The Canadian group has emerged as a
dynamic global player in the telecom equipment business in recent years, and
as the only company with a remote chance of unseating Alcatel and American
Telephone and Telegraph as the world's largest telecom equipment suppliers.
Northern Telecom, analysts believe, made the mistake of letting down those
customers on whose business its global aspirations were founded.
Its profits slumped, analysts believe, because US regional telephone
companies - the customers that Northern Telecom prised away from American
Telephone and Telegraph in the 1980s - were unhappy with the quality of the
the products and services it was delivering.
Northern Telecom is resilient and flexible enough to recover from the
setback. But its problems illustrate the pressures that technological change
and market liberalisation are putting on suppliers.
With the globalisation of the telecommunications industry, companies like
Northern Telecom have to balance the twin objectives of expanding into new
markets anri looking after existing customers.
Winning orders in markets which have traditionally been dominated by two, or
possibly three companies - many of which are supported by their governments
as national champions - has never been easy. To break into a foreign market,
a supplier has traditionally had to form a joint venture, or buy a stake in
one of the established suppliers.
Siemens became a leading supplier to British Telecom through the acquisition
of a 40 per cent stake in GPT in 1989, and to US regional operators as part
of the GPT deal which included a 50 per cent share in the former Plessey
subsidiary Stromberg Carlson.
Nortel bought a 100 per cent stake in STC, the UK's last remaining
independent supplier, in 1991, as a platform to expand into Europe, and has
since taken a 20 per cent stake in Matra Communications in France. Talks
with Bosch in Germany over a similar joint venture broke down in September.
Alcatel owes its strength in transmission systems to the purchase of
Rockwell Systems of the US in 1991, and in underseas cables, to the takeover
of Nortel's cables business agreed in August. The French manufacturer also
has a strong presence in the Italian market through Telettra, the former
telecom arm of the car giant Fiat.
AT&amp;T has a 40 per cent stake in Italian public network supplier Italtel,
while Ericsson of Sweden owns a majority stakes in Schrack of Austria and a
minority-stake in the Greek supplier Intracom.
In mobile communications, Ericsson has a 50 per cent stake in the UK company
Orbitel and an 80 per cent stake in the former General Electric subsidiary,
GE Mobile.
Mr John Dinsdale, a senior industry analyst at telecoms consultancy
Dataquest, believes that supplier rationsalisation is far from over.
In particular, companies which have relied almost exclusively on contracts
from state-controlled telephone operators, will be forced to team up with
larger suppliers, he believes. Even though most telephone operators are
still state-owned, many now operate independently from ministerial control
and gone are the days when they were expected to award contracts to domestic
suppliers.
But the conventional wisdom that there would be no more than six suppliers
of public telecommunications systems by the year 2000 now seems misguided.
Telecoms is expanding so quickly, and in so many different directions, that
it would inconceivable for a handful of suppliers to control the market.
To understand the forces that determine the structure of the telecoms supply
business, equipment can be divided into two overlapping categories.
One category is stable both in terms of technology and market share, while
in the second, technology is evolving so quickly that no supplier can feel
totally secure.
PUBLIC SWITCH AND TRANSMISSION SYSTEMS
The first - and by far the larger of the two - is public switch and
transmission systems for conventional telephone networks.
In Europe and North America, the market for public switches has largely been
played out. Operators have already digitalised their long-distance networks,
and have moved onto the more arduous, less rewarding task of digitalising
local networks. They have already selected their preferred suppliers - in
many cases, and there are few opportunities for newcomers.
The most attractive opportunities for suppliers of public switches are in
Asia, and in particular, China.
This year, China will buy nine million lines of which Alcatel will deliver
five million lines, and the balance will be divided between Ericsson,
Siemens, AT&amp;T, Nortel and NEC.
India, the continent's next largest growth market, will buy two million
lines of public switching equipemnt a year until the end of the decade, and
has already chosen Siemens, Ericsson, Fujitsu, Alcatel and AT&amp;T as preferred
suppliers.
Other growth regions include eastern Europe where Siemens has been active
with the setting up of nine joint ventures in seven countries.
CELLULAR SYSTEMS, VOICE AND DATA SERVICES
The second category groups together cellular telephone systems, data
communications networks, high capacity broadband networks and private
systems for both voice and data services.
Technology is changing so fast in these areas that opportunities are
available for new companies to compete with the established suppliers.
Ericsson and Motorola are firmly established as the leading suppliers of
cellular telephone networks, while Motorola and Nokia of Finland are the
largest suppliers of cellular telephones.
Mobile communications is the fastest growing sector of the equipment supply
business, and as consumer electronics companies diversify into mobile
telephones, they will increasingly compete with telecommunications
companies. Sony, for example, is supplying telephones to UK cellular
telephone operator Cellnet which, for the last year, has been targetting the
consumer market.
The UK company Amstrad which is better known for supplying budget PCs, is
set to become a mobile telephone supplier following its takeover last month
of Danish manufacturer, Dancall.
In the dynamic field of data communications, the arrival of US networking
companies is threatening to knock leading equipment suppliers off their
perch.
Systems are increasingly based on sophisticated computer software, and
networking companies like Novell, Cisco Systems and Synoptics, are bringing
products to the market quicker than the largest companies with a background
in telecommunications.
The leading equipment manufacturers are hoping that telephone operators will
commit heavily to broadband networks - high capacity systems that can
transmit huge volume of voice, data and image information. Operators are
testing broadband networks based around a switch technology called
Asynchronous Transer Mode, and transmission systems using Synchronous
Digital Kierarchy Technology (SDH). But the demand from users is hard to
predict and operators are conducting technical and commercial trials before
committing themselves to massive investment programmes in broadband.
Such is the buoyancy of the global telecommunications industry that there is
room for the leading suppliers to continue to expand, and for new
entrepreneurial companies to break into their traditional businesses.
For established suppliers such as Nortel, a balance must be struck between
cultivating new customer relationships and checking up on old friends.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (19): Prices are
crucial - George Black examines the 'mobile' market's prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE BLACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE mobile telephone market is one in which the stimulating effect of
de-regulation looks almost incontrovertible. But it is less clear whether
privatisation is essential for growth.
Telephone operators and authorities across Europe are still puzzling over
exactly what are the key factors that drive the business.
In the UK, deregulation coupled with privatisation created competition and
increased the market through price cuts. But in Germany, deregulation
without privatisation has been enough to create growth; and in Italy the
market has grown at over 30 per cent through price cuts, even in a monopoly
situation.
In the Scandinavian countries, where mobile phones became very popular
earlier than in the rest of Europe, cultural factors may have been as
important as political or technological ones. A small population spread
across a large area and a high proportion of people with two homes were
among possible reasons for the phenomenon.
The introduction of new technology seems to have had little to do with
market growth so far. UK dealers say that the price is the first question
people ask, not whether the system will serve their needs.
Mr Alan Harper, business strategy director for Mercury One-2-One, the third
company to enter the UK market, said there was no real evidence that digital
quality affected buyers much at the moment.
Lower tariffs aimed at recruiting domestic subscribers have helped to
increase the market in the past year in the UK, Italy and Germany. In the
UK, it began with the launch of the Low Price service by Cellnet (British
Telecom and Securicor) in November.
In five months the market doubled its size to about 1m users, and its growth
rate from 40,000 connections a month to 80,000. This helped Cellnet to gain
ground on its rival Vodafone; Vodafone now has about 1m customers, Cellnet
800,000. The two companies have been signing up new subscribers in about
equal numbers in recent months.
Most market forecasts show between 8m and 10m UK users by the year 2000,
although Vodafone expects only 5-6m. This is based on the assumptions of
expansion mainly on the consumer side, falling entry-level cost and a wider
range of consumer-targeted tariffs and services.
Margins are beginning to narrow for all the contestants; they may narrow
further with the entry next year of a fourth competitor, Microtel, from
Hutchison Whampoa of Hong Kong.
Mr Geoff Finch, director of corporate programmes and strategy for Cellnet,
comments: 'It is difficult to see that there will be much profitability for
four players with 8-10m users and with the current range of services.'
However, he notes that the market had been outpacing expectations ever since
1983.
THERE have also been recent signs that the level of use by subscribers is
beginning to rise. But the key question - to which the telephone companies
do not yet know the answer - is whether further price cuts will trigger a
higher level of use.
'We need to know people's behaviour patterns more precisely,' says Mr Finch.
'We are spending many hours trying to analyse them.'
The launch of the Mercury One-2-One digital service by Cable &amp; Wireless and
US West during September was seen by the industry as a marketing success,
especially the offer of free calls at off-peak times, to attract home users.
Mr Harper says that One-2-One's high-street distribution channels had
increased their forecasts as a result and there was a temporary shortage of
handsets.
The company had over 50,000 inquiries in the first month in response to its
Pounds 10m advertising campaign. About 80 per cent of One-2-One's customers
were first-time users and more than half of them were primarily domestic
users.
Early reports are divided on whether digital technology offers any
improvement over analog. The One-2-One service is at present confined to the
area within the M25 motorway around London. Some users say it only works
well close to the M25, where the base stations are located. Others say they
have had good service a number of miles beyond the M25.
Technology enthusiasts insist that digital will prove itself superior and be
better able to guarantee a good service. They predict that almost the whole
market will go digital over the next 10 years.
Digital will be helped by the progress of the GSM (Groupe Speciale Mobile)
pan-European standard. This should prove especially attractive to business
users, because through it they can be contacted from Italy to Norway. It
will be even more useful when mobile phones start to be used for data
transmission.
In Germany, the creation of a duopoly has helped the market grow, even
without the privatisation of Telekom, which is not expected until at least
1998. Last year the first competitor to Telekom, Mannesmann Mobilfunk,
entered the market, using lower prices to catch up and overtake. In July
Telekom set up a new private cellular company called DeTeMobil, which has
offered cheaper rates and begun to retrieve Telekom's position.
The German market is growing much faster than had been expected. There are
at present between 600,000 and 800,000 subscribers and there could be 10m by
the year 2,000. A third supplier, E-Plus, will enter the market in 1994.
Italy now has 1m users, which puts it second to the UK in the European
market. The monopoly of SIP, the public phone operator, has not prevented
the market from growing fast.
During October the Italian government was expected to announce plans for
allowing a second supplier into the market. Arguably, SIP's new lower
off-peak rates targeted at the consumer market have been induced by the
prospect of competition, for which the EC has been pushing. The entry of a
competitor is expected to bring more price cuts and keep the market growing.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (18): Subscriber
base now 23 million - Mobile communications / The world's fastest growing
cellular market is the Asia-Pacific region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVER the past 18 months Europe has provided the launchpad for the second
generation of mobile telecommunications networks and a new range of services
based on digital rather than analogue technology.
These new digital networks - labelled with acronyms like GSM, MCN and PCN
(or PCS in the US) - promise to deliver a wide range of sophisticated new
voice and data services to corporate, individual and residential customers
and will help ensure that mobile telephony remains the fastest growing
segment of the world telecommunications industry.
The 1980s saw the birth of mobile cellular telecommunications, but the 1990s
have seen them blossom. According to Mobile Communications, the FT
Newsletter, the worldwide cellular telephone subscriber base grew by more
than 40 per cent to 23m last year.
In the US, which remains the biggest cellular market, subscriber numbers
have grown from around a million in 1984 to over 12m today and the pace is
still accelerating. Economic and Management Consultants International
(ECMI), the Washington-based consultancy, has forecast 17.7m US subscribers
by the end of 1995 and 25m a year later.
In western Europe the picture is similar with the subscriber base rising by
almost 35 per cent to 7.25m in the 12 months to the end of July. CIT
Research, the London-based technology consultancy, has predicted nearly 12m
subscribers by the end of 1996 and 19.1m by the year 2000.
Growth is more difficult to predict in eastern Europe although a number of
countries including Poland, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria have plans for
cellular systems and some like Hungary are leapfrogging the older analogue
technology and moving directly to digital systems.
In some areas of the former Eastern Bloc, including eastern Germany,
cellular systems provide a relatively cheap and effective alternative to the
dilapidated, inadequate and unreliable fixed wire systems. Licensing new
cellular operators - sometimes including overseas companies like US West -
also provides an opportunity to introduce competition. But the fastest
growing cellular market is the Asia-Pacific region. The number of cellular
subscribers in the largest markets grew by 50 per cent to 4m last year, and
growth in the current year is again expected to outstrip that in Europe and
the US.
Indeed, it is not just cellular radio services which are booming in region.
Telepoint and paging services have also proved highly popular, particularly
in Hong Kong where there are now three telepoint networks and more than
800,000 paging subscribers, matching the tally for the whole of the UK.
This worldwide surge in demand for mobile telecommunications services means
that by the end of this decade half of all telephone calls world-wide are
expected to originate or terminate on a mobile phone - and a growing
proportion of those telephones will be operating on the new digital
technology.
Digital technology provides some advantages over older analogue systems.
Among these, digital mobile telephones can provide more reliable, clearer
and more secure telecommunications - although at least for the moment these
usually have to be offset by higher equipment costs.
But digital services are also intrinsically more 'efficient' because by
converting ordinary sound into computer code they can also pack at least 10
times as many calls into the same 'space' in the radio spectrum.
They are also easier to integrate with modern fixed telecommunications and
data processing equipment and enable network operators and others to provide
a wide range of value added customer services like messaging services and
data transmission.
Although the US led way with the first generation of cellular services in
the early 1980s, Europe has taken the lead in switch to digital systems in
the 1990s. The driving force behind this move was the adoption in the
mid-1980s of a pan-European digital telecommunications standard called GSM,
(Groupe Speciale Mobile). The adoption of a single digital standard to
provide a seamless cellular system across Europe has provided several key
advantages including ensuring substantial economies of scale for
infrastructure and handset equipment manufacturers.
In contrast, in the US a dispute between network operators over two rival
digital standards, one called time division multiple access (TDMA) and the
other called code-division multiple access (CDMA) has delayed the widespread
introduction of digital systems.
Twenty-three operators in 16 European countries committed themselves to
building GSM networks, and more than another 20 countries around the world,
including many in Asia, have adopted GSM as the basis for their next
generation of cellular services.
The first GSM networks were launched 15 months ago in Germany, France and
Denmark, and all the leading European Community states apart from Spain now
have them in operation, although in some coverage is still patchy. GSM
subscribers have accounted for about one third of all new subscribers to
cellular networks in western Europe since then.
By the end of this year, Dataquest is forecasting that there will be 1.1m
digital subscribers in Europe, growing to 8.31m by the end of 1996. The
biggest market by far has been Germany which had over 500,000 subscribers to
its two GSM networks by the end of July - 80 per cent of the European total.
Most countries have licensed two GSM network operators in contrast to the
first generation of cellular analogue networks, which were mostly provided
by the state-controlled PTTs except for the UK where two competing analogue
cellular network operators were also licensed. These were Cellnet, in which
BT, the former state monopoly operator, holds a 60 per cent stake, and
Vodafone , the market leader.
Vodafone's GSM network is already operational while Cellnet plans to launch
its system early next year, initially on a regional basis. Meanwhile,
Vodafone has already has reached GSM roaming agreements with a number of
other network operators overseas which enables GSM subscribers carrying
their personal smartcards to make calls using a GSM phone anywhere in
Europe.
For the moment, these GSM services are mostly being marketed as premium
services for business customers. Another set of new digital services, being
pioneered in the UK, are aimed at the broader consumer market, complimentary
rather than rival to the traditional fixed line domestic telephone.
Last month the first of these new PCN (Personal Communications Network)
services, dubbed One-2-One, was launched in the London area by a joint
venture of Mercury Communications and US West. Initially, its coverage is
confined to the M25 area around London, but there are plans to expand
coverage rapidly. Next April a second PCN service is due to be launched by
Hutchison Microtel, a subsidiary of Hutchison Telecom.
Meanwhile, Vodafone has launched a second national digital service called
MetroDigital which exploits GSM technology. Like One-2-One MetroDigital is
designed to provide a lower-cost local digital portable telephone service
for use mainly in urban areas.
The arrival of these new services has, as expected, already triggered an
advertising blitz and fierce pricing war between operators in the UK and is
also likely to lead to some repositioning of the two analogue networks -
both Cellnet and Vodafone have recently revised their tariff structures.
Elsewhere in Europe, PCN services are likely to be developed in Germany,
France and Spain. Some countries have also licensed digital call-only
Telepoint services, such as Hutchison's Rabbit service in the UK and France
Telecom's Be-Bop service in Paris.
GSM and the other new digital services will not replace the older analogue
networks immediately - there will probably be a gradual migration to them.
Similarly, although it is likely to be many years before mobile systems can
compete directly on cost with fixed wire networks, new competition is likely
to erode the premium that mobile telephony still commands.

   THE liberalisation of telecommunications in the US
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
and now Europe - has led to greater competition between established network
operators, new entrants and specialised niche market players. At the same
time, technological advances, particularly the shift to digital systems,
have provided service operators with fresh opportunities. The result is a
proliferation of value-added services aimed at corporate customers.
For example, the digitalisation of BT's UK network has enabled the former
PTT to offer a bundle of 'Star Services' - call-forwarding, call-waiting,
caller identification and other special facilities which until recently have
only been available of large companies' internal private branch exchanges
(PBX).
Similarly, the introduction of competing GSM (Groupe Systeme Mobile) digital
cellular networks across Europe will give network operators an opportunity
to exploit a whole new range of features like GSM's short message facility
which allows handsets fitted with liquid crystal screens to receive
160-character messages, twice as long as the typical alphanumeric
radio-pager.
Mr Martin O'Byrne, managing director of Sema Group's telecom division which
worked with Vodafone in the UK to develop the facility, believes that SMS
and other features like it will provide network operators with an important
way of differentiating their GSM networks.
Value-added services are already an important and rapidly growing source of
revenues for the telecommunications industry. The US Commerce Department
estimated that providers of value-added services including electronic data
interchange (EDI), electronic mail, enhanced facsimile and managed network
services in the US will earn around Dollars 8bn this year.
Across the Atlantic, Ovum, the technology consultancy, produces a continuous
information service called 'Vans Market Europe,' which forecasts that the
European market will almost treble in value from Ecu 4.05bn in 1991 to Ecu
11.6bn in 1996, (see table).
Ovum says France is the biggest Vans market in Europe although its share of
the total is declining as other markets (such as Germany) expand. France
Telcom ranks as Europe's Vans market leader with an estimated 20 per cent of
the market followed by Deutsche Bundespost Telekom (13 per cent),
Telephonica (10 per cent), Reuters (7.5 per cent), BT (4.1 per cent) and IBM
(3.7 per cent).
DATA NETWORK SERVICES
Packet-switched and other data services were among the first true
value-added services offered first in the US and subsequently in Europe.
The three most common data network services are telecommunications
companies' public X25 network, other vendors managed data network services
and the big US and pan-European special purpose networks operated by
companies like Reuters or consortia such as Swift.
Traditional X25 packet-switched data networks provide a simple means for
exchanging data between sites, but high prices and uncertainty about whether
X25 can meet current and future requirements for high bandwidth services
like video-conferencing have led to the development of alternatives known as
fast-packet switching services.
These include a fast packet technology called Asynchronous Transfer Mode
(ATM) and frame relay, a slimmed-down version of X25 which is faster,simpler
and cheaper than X25 and provides an ideal interconnection service for local
area networks (Lans).
In the United States, Frost and Sullivan, the market consultancy, has
estimated that the market for fast packet switching services will rise from
Dollars 74m in 1992 to Dollars 2bn by 1997.
FRAME RELAY
Ovum expects frame relay to account for eight per cent of the European Vans
market by 1996 - astonishing growth given that two years ago it was little
more than another high-tech concept which emerged out of ISDN
standardisation work.
Vendors in the US, where it is already well established, include the long
distance carriers, local exchange carriers, local data specialists like
Compuserve as well as internationally oriented managed network service
providers like BT and Infonet. The market is now expanding quickly in Europe
where most PTTs, together with AT&amp;T Istel and a handful of data specialists,
have either launched, or have plans to launch, frame relay services.
Ovum believes that in Europe 40 per cent of commercial sites with more than
100 employees will be using frame relay within five years of a national
service being introduced.
ELECTRONIC DATA INTERCHANGE (EDI)
EDI enables two organisations, usually customer and supplier, to exchange
routine business documentation such as orders and invoices using standard
electronic forms and their own computers linked through a service provider.
It is often a faster, cheaper and more reliable means of exchanging
information than the traditional paper-based business transaction and can
play a crucial role in automating a transaction chain.
These benefits have spurred growth in the use of EDI in the US, where it
originated, and in the UK and the Netherlands which lead Europe in EDI
usage.
Ovum expects the EDI market in Europe, including customer software and
support, to grow from about Ecu 196m in 1992 to about Ecu 590m in 1997, a
compound annual growth rate of 24 per cent.
The market leaders in Europe are IBM and Geis which have pan-European
networks and services and International Network Services (INS, jointly owned
by Geis and ICL) which dominates the market in the UK with an estimated 55
per cent market share.
ELECTRONIC MAIL
Unlike EDI, electronic mail is a non-interactive service based on sending
computer originated messages across a telecommunications network. In Europe,
electronic mail is already a significant and fast-expanding Vans market.
Ovum estimates that service providers earned Ecu 176m from electronic mail
services last year and will earn almost ECu 1.5bn by 1997.
The largest share of the market is held by BT GNS (formerly Tymnet) followed
by IBM, Unisource and Geis.
Ovum has identified seven other smaller market players including AT&amp;T,
Easylink, Mercury and Sprint. The UK is the largest electronic mail market
in Europe.
ENHANCED FACSIMILE
Value-added fax services are now widely available in the US and Europe and
have proved highly popular on both sides of the Atlantic.
Common features include broadcast fax to multiple destinations, automatic
retry and deferred delivery.
Ovum says the the European market is expanding 'spectacularly' and is set to
become one of the larger Vans markets growing 12 fold to be worth Ecu 436m
by 1997 compared to Ecu 36.3m last year.
Part of the reason for this substantial increase is the popularity of basic
fax services coupled with a desire by corporate customers in particular to
control and cut fax costs.
The PTT are among the most active suppliers of enhanced fax services however
there are also a growing number of niche suppliers. In Europe, AT&amp;T Easylink
led the way in 1990 with its Enhanced Fax (E-Fax) service and Italcable
launched its Multifax service the following year.
In the UK, which is the largest market in Europe, BT, Mercury and Sprint all
offer enhanced fax services.
Among the other Vans videotext during the 1980s all the European PTTs
followed BT's example and launched videotext services but while these have
proved very popular in some markets such as France, they have been much
slower to develop in other markets including the UK and Germany.
What is certain is that PTOs and others will continue to devise new
value-added network services in an attempt to boost revenues, exploit the
technology and retain their customers.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (16): More vital
than ever - Satellite technology / By the turn of the century, satellite
technology may well have plugged the last gap in providing a truly global
mobile telecommunications system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR

<TEXT>
SATELLITES already play a crucial role in fixed and mobile
telecommunications. They provide voice, data and video links across
continents and oceans, maritime and aeronautical communications where
land-based systems are not an option and global positioning and tracking
services for military and other customers.
Increasingly, they are being used in the US and elsewhere to provide two-way
Vsat (Very small aperture terminal) satellite telecommunications services to
businesses - a market which in the UK alone is expected to grow to between
Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m within the next five years.
They are also used to provide telecommunications facilities to geologists,
journalists and others in remote or inhospitable regions of the world using
briefcase-size portable satellite terminals, such as those supplied by
Inmarsat, the London-based 69-member International Maritime Satellite
Organisation. Inmarsat, which uses four operational satellites, already has
25,000 customers, most of them in its traditional market of ship-to-shore
communications.
These services are mostly based on geo-stationary satellites (Geos) which
orbit the earth at a height of between 12,000 and 25,000 miles. But soon, if
plans go to schedule, a new type of satellite system based on low earth
orbit (Leo) satellites will help deliver the first truly global handheld
mobile telephone service capable of providing voice and data
telecommunications literally 'any where on earth.'
Among the handful of Leo-based telecommunications system proposals which
have been unveiled in the last few years by international consortia, the
Dollars 3.4bn Iridium project, conceived by Motorola, the US-based
electronics group, is probably the most ambitious and advanced.
The Iridium project will be based on a 66 Leo satellites ringing the earth
at a height of just under 500 miles with each satellite in sight of several
others at all times. Thus a message to or from a handheld mobile telephone
operating on the Iridium network could be transferred between satellites
before being beamed down to its destination anywhere on earth.
Two months ago Motorola announced that after several years of funding all
the research itself, it had raised Dollars 800m from an international
consortium, including Bell Canada, Raytheon, Sprint, Sony and Mitsubishi as
the first stage towards financing the Iridium project.
As prime contractor for the project, Motorola will be responsible for
designing and building the entire Iridium network and has a Dollars 2.8bn
contract to maintain and operate the system for five years after it is
launched in 1998. By that stage, Motorola's stake in the project will have
fallen from 34 per cent to 15 per cent as new investors join.
The financing agreement gives Iridium a clear lead in the race to build a
satellite-based mobile telephone system based on Leo technology.
Leos are designed to orbit at between 450 to 6,000 miles; and because they
are closer to earth than geo-stationary satellites, telecommunications
systems built around Leos should suffer less from the characteristic echo
heard on some satellite voice links.
They will also work with much less powerful - and therefore smaller,lighter
and cheaper - telecommunications equipment including pocket-sized handsets.
But there are disadvantages. Like Geos, they are solar powered but because
they orbit lower they will spend more time in shadow and therefore have a
shorter life span, perhaps five years instead of 10 or more for conventional
satellites.
However, their biggest - and costliest - disadvantage is that to provide
reliable global coverage many more Leos are needed than would be the case
with their higher-flying counterparts.
This also means a large number of launches, and an extended roll-out time.
For example, Iridium plans to place its 'constellation' of satellites in
orbit over two years starting in 1996 and will use a combination of
McDonnell Douglas Delta rockets from the US, the Proton rocket from Russia
and China's Long March launch vehicle.
Another five consortia, mainly comprising US and European space and
telecommunications companies, have proposed similar schemes although none
are quite so ambitious as Iridium and most of them still have to win solid
financial backing.
Most of the groups plan to start commercial operations between 1996 and the
end of the decade. Several other groups have plans for Leo systems which
would provide data rather than voice services.
MOTOROLA'S success in securing financial backing for Iridium is likely to
trigger a race between the other Leo contenders, not only because there are
limits to the world's satellite launching capacity, but also because most
analysts believe the market can probably support only two competitors.
To supplement revenues from voice traffic Leo systems will also carry fax
messages, paging, facsimile, computer data and provide radio-determination
satellite services - services which locate radio transmitters by latitude
and longitude. They could also provide voice and data links for the next
generation of personal digital assistants which will begin appearing later
this decade.
Iridium hopes to have 2m customers four years after the network becomes
operational. Each customer will have to buy either an Iridium handset or a
dual purpose handset which will work with both Iridium and the buyer's own
local mobile telephone network. Calls will cost about Dollars 3 a minute and
the handsets are likely to cost about Dollars 1,700.
Some analysts question whether Leos make economic sense as a mass market
voice telecom delivery system in competition with much cheaper
terrestrial-based networks, especially since it seems probable that there
will be an oversupply of satellite system networks.
Aside from the other Leo satellite consortia, Inmarsat also has plans to
build its own satellite-based global hand-held mobile telephone service
designated Project 21 which has been viewed by many as the main rival for
Motorola's Iridium project.
Originally, Inmarsat had planned to base Project 21 on a Dollars 2bn Leo
network. However, in a surprise decision at the end of July, the Leo plan
was abandoned in favour of a network using fewer satellites placed in higher
geostationary or intermediate orbits.
The decision to opt for a conventional system was taken after Inmarsat
commissioned reports on the options and should enable the organisation to
reduce its investment to about Dollars 1bn. Whether or not the decision will
benefit Iridium and the other Leo groups is debatable.
On the one hand, it means Inmarsat has given up the advantages of Leo
systems and could have implications for the type of service that it can
offer and this could make it easier for Iridium and others to secure
investor support for their Leo systems. On the other hand, it highlights the
technical complexities of Leo systems and may enable Inmarsat to provide a
cheaper service.
For Iridium these issues are likely to come to the fore when the initial
funding runs out and it seeks another tranche of almost equal size within
two years. The remaining 60 per cent of the project cost is expected to come
from the debt market.
International investors will also want to be reassured that a number of
other difficult issues have been resolved. Among these is the issue of
frequency allocation. The World Administrative Radio Conference agreed in
principle last year on which frequencies to allocate to Leos, but since
then, the various consortia have been unable to agree how this allocation
should be divided up.
The dispute has arisen because Iridium, unlike all its other rivals, plans
to use time division multiple access (TDMA) technology - which does not
permit frequency sharing.
In contrast, all the other proposed systems would use code division multiple
access or spread spectrum technology which can share a block of frequencies.
The dispute has already delayed the timetable for licensing global mobile
satellite systems in the US and will probably require a US Federal
Communications Commission ruling on the issue.
The other main unresolved problem is about who should regulate global mobile
satellite system operators - an issue which is exercising the European
Commission and other would-be regulators.

<TEXT>
GPT Video Systems of Maidenhead is supplying what is claimed to be the first
video-conferencing network in China. Fourteen cities will be video-linked in
Hunan Province.
'The problem facing Chinese officials is the fast distances they have to
cover to attend a face-to-face meetings,' says Mr Tom Doyle, director of
video and ISDN systems at GPT. The Chinese network could also be linked with
international, interactive video meetings with western industrial companies,
he says.
SATELLITE APPLICATIONS IN ASIA
Research in south-east Asia has revealed the need for a new
hardware-orientated exhibition for cable and satellite technologies, says
Reed Exhibition Companies of London.
'Cable &amp; Satellite '94', focusing on the operational needs of business, will
be held at the Hong Kong Exhibition Centre from November 30 to December 2,
next year.
TELECOM REVENUES UP 11 PER CENT
Western European revenues from the provision of telecommunications totalled
Ecu 102.1 (equal to Dollars 119bn or Pounds 79bn) last year - up 11 per cent
on 1991, according to a new report from the London-based CIT Research group.
But between 1992 and 2002, CIT expects an annual average growth rate of 5.6
per cent a year in real terms.
Despite the big strides in telecoms network technology and services over the
last 20 years, public switched telephony networks (PSTNs) are still the
mainstay of European telecommunications. In 1992, says CIT, Ecu 83.3bn worth
of phone bills were paid across western Europe - a sum equivalent to Dollars
97bn or Pounds 64bn.
About 25 per cent of PSTN charges were for access (connection and line
rental) and 75 per cent for calls.
TREND TOWARDS GLOBAL NETWORKS
British business is on the verge of 'massive worldwide networking
investment,' according to new research among 100 leading UK organisations.
The report, by analysts at Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton, found that 55 per cent of
companies have international networking requirements, with the majority (67
per cent) wishing to link territories globally, rather than just within
Europe (27 per cent), followed by the US (18 per cent) and the Far East (13
per cent).
Alan Davis, managing director of Ascom Timeplex, a leader in the total
networking solutions sector - and publisher of the report - says that the
sharing of business information 'is not just from desk to desk or from
office to office, but rather from country to country. UK companies realise
that linking globally is a means of gaining competitive advantage in a
worldwide market.'
Research by Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton on networking market trends, established
four critical factors: changes in voice management, computing, carrier
strategies and user competencies - all of which impact the development of
networking in Europe, the US and Japan in different ways.
In the US, for example, most of the users in the survey had shifted a large
portion of their voice traffic to virtual private
networks, but in the Far East almost all traffic is on the public network.
These differences, says Alan Davis, affect the way in which companies
communicate globally and require network suppliers to have an in-depth grasp
of networking across countries.
Consultants Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, in another report on the
business impact of 'wire-less' communications, say that 'companies know
about that wire-less communications deliver real benefits, but have yet to
be fully persuaded that the investment is justified.'
Touche Ross believes that 'substantial growth will come over the next five
years, driven by the development of applications that enable users to reap
the full benefits of the technology.'
The race to supply new global services: see page 7.
NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES
The development of wireless computer technology, as used in today's cellular
telephones, personal communications systems or mobile radio systems, will
create a new area of business and marketing potential, according to CSC
Index, the international management consultancy.
The forecast lists several areas of opportunity: first, is the 'migration'
of business transactions - wireless technology will anable sales and service
transactions to be made as close to the customer as possible, unlike most
current transactions which have to take place at a fixed point next to a
computer - for example, at the cash register, reservation desk or office.
This 'untethered' communications facility is already being tested by an
international airline in a roving check-in service for passengers as they
enter air terminals. Their travel information is then entered into a
hand-held computer connected to the check-in system over a radio network.
Other areas for development singled out by CSC Index - a subsidiary of
Computer Sciences Corporation - are the tracking and deployment of items in
a supply chain, where trucks can tracked and goods 'tell you' where they
are; also in 'turbo-charging' business organisation - speeding the
administrative reactions to customers, suppliers or employees by providing
on-the-spot response and acceleration of planning processes.
The consultants forecast that by the year 2000 as much as half of all voice
and data communications traffic could be via wireless computer technology.
SATELLITE LINK FOR AUTO PARTS DISTRIBUTOR
Dana Distribution UK, an automotive after-market company, has signed a
contract with Hughes-Maxat under which all its 115 locations will be
provided with a two-way VSAT (very small aperture terminal) network.
This network links Dana's Swindon headquarters, its main UK distribution
centre in Milton Keynes and 113 branches, and will carry all sales and
inventory details on more than 40,000 product lines.
POUNDS 4M INVESTMENT IN CELLULAR SERVICES
Securicor Cellular Services is investing Pounds 4m to improve customer
service. Research by SCS, the cellular service provider of the Securicor
group, shows that while more than 85 per cent of customers are 'reasonably
satisfied' with service they receive, the company aims 'to create
differentiation through service delivery, raising customer expectations,
industry-wide.'

FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (14): A new breed
of communications - Multimedia / The convergence of media, communications
and computer technologies promises to create a revolution in communications
which will be as profound as the building of the railways in the last
century
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE telecommunications industry is likely to be the first to feel the full
impact of multimedia - technology that combines communications with
animated, high-resolution computer graphics and video, hi-fi sound, computer
data and - most important of all - interaction between the system and the
user.
Now, a new breed of communications services, which have the power and
capacity to carry video images alongside traditional audio, have made
video-conferencing and desktop digital video possible.
Integrated Services Digital Networks (ISDN), which can carry all forms of
multimedia data, are now widely available, high-speed local area networks
which can handle the large data volumes are becoming available and terminal
equipment is falling in price.
At the same time, telecommunications suppliers are adopting international
standards which will make it feasible to introduce full multimedia
communications in the next few years.
These developments in the telecommunications infrastructure will open the
door to many new exciting applications - particularly those that involve
remote co-operative working. Current electronic mail and workgroup
applications, for example, will receive a boost from full multimedia
communications and allow people to work together in new ways.
The market research group, Ovum, forecasts significant growth for multimedia
communications in the next five years. From a base of zero in 1991, Ovum
estimates that revenues from multimedia communications software in the US
and Europe will be over Dollars 1.6bn by 1997.
'All the technology building blocks are in place - we just need to find a
way to integrate them so they work together seamlessly,' says Mr Claude
L'Eglise, video brand director at Intel.
Mr L'Eglise believes that the desktop computer is most likely candidate as
the primary platform for multimedia terminals.
Although telecommunications suppliers - such as British Telecom in the UK -
have introduced stand-alone videophone systems, it seems unlikely that
people are going to want yet another TV screen on their desks.
If they are to have video, they want it integrated into their desktop
computer.
Intel is working with a number of partners to take the next step and make it
possible to deliver multimedia communications to the desktop.
In addition to its work at the microprocessor level with the Indeo
technology to speed up digital video processing, Intel is working with
Microsoft to develop away to control telephone systems digitally.
Intel is also working with Siemens Nixdorf and Ericsson to develop
deliverable multimedia services across networks.
But the cost of terminal equipment is key - 'the price of a
multimedia-equipped PC must be low enough to attract the market and it must
be easy to install and use. We are getting nearer to this everyday,' Mr
L'Eglise explains.
'The PC and the Macintosh are powerful enough to act as terminal devices and
the public networks are fast enough to carry the signals,' he says.
Mr L'Eglise sees a big market for multimedia telecommunications - especially
for remote and co-operative working - 'people want to exchange documents and
work on them together. We see multimedia communications offering the ability
to do this over a network,' he says.
Some users may be closer to multimedia communications than they know. For
example, users of the 2100 Premier telephone service, supplied by UK
telecommunications company Mercury, only require minor hardware additions to
plug their PCs into the network now.
'Most of our customers do not realise yet that they can use multimedia
communications by plugging their PCs into our network through an IST
'FeaturePhone.' We hope to raise awareness of this service this year,' says
Mr Robert Ralphs, application manager at Mercury.
'Terminal equipment is coming down to a price which people can afford and
they already use electronic mail systems. It is not too much to expect that
they will take the next step and move to multimedia,' explains Mr Ralphs.
The first products to exploit the new communications infrastructure have
already begun to emerge. Northern Telecom, for example, announced its
'Visit' system and demonstrated it at the Multimedia Show at London's Earls
Court, earlier this year.
Olivetti has been working for some time on digital video on the desktop at
its research laboratories in Cambridge. The Pandora project - which brought
multimedia communications to desktop workstations a couple of years ago -
has produced what Olivetti calls the Personal Communication Computer (PCC).
The PCC, which is based on a standard Windows PC, not only brings video
communications to the desktop - it also enables two users to work on the
same information over an ISDN link.
Pilot systems are already being tested in the UK and in Italy.
Olivetti has used similar technology to create a multimedia banking 'kiosk'
which lets customers access their accounts and call up a human financial
'counsellor' who appears in a digital video window in the corner of the
screen to give advice.
Both the customer and the adviser can look at the same account data
simultaneously.
Pilot systems are installed at three branches of the San Paulo Institute,
one of Italy's largest retail banks.
Mr Mark Churchward, a divisional manager at Olivetti UK, sees these systems
as only the beginning of what can be done with multimedia communications.
'We see multimedia as a technology - not a market. So we are coming with new
ideas based on what our customers are telling us.
'Multimedia gives us different ways to tackle old problems,' he says.
One key area of development is in remote diagnosis. Multimedia networks
provide experts with the ability to examine problems in detail without being
present at the site of the problem.
This applies as much to, say, a medical problem where a surgeon can monitor
an operation remotely, as it does to technical problem with an aircraft
where an engineer diagnose a fault remotely.
Mr Churchward notes, for example, that the paper documentation for a Boeing
747 jumbo jet weighs more than the aircraft. He says that Boeing is working
on ways not only to record documentation electronically, but also to
structure in such a way that data can be accessed remotely and used for
diagnosing problems.
Similarly, the 'Superjanet' network which links research institutions across
the UK, provides multimedia communications for researchers and medical
practitioners to work remotely.
In both cases the need is for a rich level of communications which can only
be provided by full multimedia technology. The convergence of media,
communications and computer technologies promises to create a revolution in
communications which will be as profound as the building of the railways in
the last century.
Businesses which recognise this early will be the leaders of the next
century.

keep tight control - Japan / Japan's telecommunications industry is still
highly regulated

THIS summer, NTT, the world's second largest telecommunications company,
said that fierce competition from competitors was forcing it to seek
voluntary retirement among its employees in a bid to reduce staff numbers by
30,000 over the next several years.
The move by NTT, which shook a Japanese public long accustomed to stability
in the labour market, revealed one of the more unfortunate effects of the
growing trend in Japan to liberalise the telecommunications industry.
But, while NTT's decision was made in response to market forces, it was also
dictated to a large extent by a Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications'
decree that even in an increasingly competitive environment, the
telecommunications operator will cut costs before it is allowed to raise
prices where it has the ability to do so.
NTT's plight stems from a need to adjust its operations to a fast-changing
environment. It will have to make further adjustments as the Japanese
telecommunications industry, in common with those of other leading
economies, undergoes a period of rapid transformation that is being
triggered by the speed of advances in telecommunications technology.
Optical fibre technology, for example, is making it possible to offer more
advanced and speedier forms of communications, such as video on demand or
video conferencing services.
But, while such technological progress forms the basis for change in the
industry, it is the policy decisions made by public regulators striving to
keep pace with the technology that determines the nature of the changes the
industry will have to live with.
Despite a broad move towards deregulation in the country, regulation of the
telecommunications industry in Japan is still very tight, and there are few
signs that the grip of the regulators is set to relax dramatically in the
next few years.
Characteristically, the Japanese authorities continue to take a
paternalistic attitude towards the telecommunications industry, which they
see primarily as a provider of a public service.
That view has shaped their approach not only to the liberalisation of the
telecoms market but also to the introduction of the new services that are
becoming possible with the rapid advances in fibre optics technology.
The enhancement of capacity and speed will make telecommunications a key
element of Japan's social infrastructure by making possible new services,
such as improved teleconferencing, interactive TV and video on demand, says
Mr Tetsuo Yamakawa, senior advisor in the communications policy bureau of
the policy division at the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications.
This, in turn, will help revitalise manufacturing industry, ease
overcrowding in cities and improve the quality of life, he believes.
But at the same time, however, these changes throw up difficulties that are
challenging the Japanese authorities' ability to decide what policies are in
the best public interest.
The spread of fibre optics, which allows broadcasting and telecommunications
services to be provided on the same network, will erode the boundary that
separates the two industries.
While this may not normally be a problem for industries that operate
strictly on market forces, it is posing a major dilemma for the
Telecommunications Ministry which sees a fundamental difference in the aims
of the two industries.
'The problem with putting broadcasting and telecommunications on one network
is that broadcasting is a service that is by its nature open, whereas
telecommunications is private and closed,' says Mr Yamakawa. 'Is it a good
idea to put these two industries together?' he asks.
The other problem, Mr Yamakawa points out, is that the two industries are
structured completely differently. The broadcasting industry only has to
worry about making profits, whereas the telecommunications industry must
concern itself with the needs of the public. If the two businesses come
together, which will take priority, profits or the public?
Next spring, the ministry is beginning a pilot project to study the
feasibility of integrating broadcasting and telecommunications services
through optic fibre networks.
The pilot project, supported by telecommunications carriers, broadcasters
and equipment manufacturers from both Japan and overseas, will construct a
model network including 300 end-user facilities in the Kansai Science City
near Kyoto, Osaka and Nara. It will provide high definition TV, bilateral
advanced cable TV, video on demand, videophone and video-conferencing
services on an experimental basis.
The ministry sees the pilot project as an experiment in policy rather than
technology - 'we will be considering through the project, who should be the
provider of the new integrated services,' Mr Yamakawa says.
The pilot project will go on for three years. In the meantime, a government
advisory committe which is deliberating on the issue, will present its
proposal next March on how the infrastructure for the new telecommunications
network should be built.
In parallel with these developments in their home market, Japan's telecom
operators are facing the need to keep pace with developments on the
international front to secure new sources of revenue but also to ensure that
they do not get left behind in the race to provide new telecommunications
services.
The separation of domestic and international telecommunications businesses
under Japanese law makes this extremely difficult.
'Telecommunications is a trans-national business, so separating the two
sides is like putting a rope around your own neck,' says Mr Kazuo Asada,
senior vice president of international affairs at NTT.
But an easing of this rule of separation by the Ministry last May is
providing possibilities Japan's telecommunications operators did not have
before. Although domestic carriers are not allowed to do trans-national
business, they are now allowed to operate within the domestic market of a
foreign country.
The relaxation of the rule is encouraging NTT, for example, to move into the
mobile communications and mulitmedia businesses outside Japan.
Mr Asada is interested in the US in particular, since that country is a
melting pot of new communications technology and services and would provide
opportunities to test the company's hand at new services such as personal
handy phones which combine computer capabilities with mobile communications.
Mr Asada is looking for opportunities to tie up with a cable operator in the
US or form a joint venture with a mobile phones business there.
'We want to do something different from conventional phone business,' he
says.
While Japan's technological know-how in telecommunications has a high
reputation internationally, the restrictions imposed by the country's
regulatory regime has made it necessary for the Japanese industry to follow
the lead of the US in providing new services.
The hopes in the industry are that the regulators will take a more
forward-looking view in their decision over who should provide the next
generation network.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (12): 100 million
lines by year 2000 - China's telephone target / The big growth area for
foreign telecom exporters to China is public switching equipment
</HEADLINE>

IN THE face of China's critical shortage of telephone lines and public
switching equipment, foreign telecommunications manufacturers are engaged in
an intense battle for market share to meet the enormous consumer demand in
the world's fastest growing economy.
'It's a big, big market,' comments a western business executive from a
telecommunications multinational. 'No matter how fast China's population
grows, the demand for telephones is still increasing at phenomenal rates.'
China has 17 million phone lines. It has already nearly reached its target
for the country's five-year plan, which ends in 1995. China's official goal
now is to have 100 million lines operating by the year 2000. Nationwide,
this means China has about 1.7 telephones for every 100 people. In contrast,
the United States has about 60 telephones per 100 people.
China's public pay phones are scarce and the utilisation rate is so heavy
domestically that most telephones are busy ninety per cent of the time.
In addition, getting through to the right number is difficult - 'the 'hit
rate' is so bad that callers have to recall and redial and recall,' says a
western businessman.
The largest growth area for foreign telecommunication exporters is public
switching equipment, which some industry sources say is a billion dollar
marketplace in China.
The country is modernising and updating its telephone exchanges by
installing 'stored program computers' (SPCs) to replace the older
electro-mechanical equipment to do the switching.
The dominant equipment manufacturers in this market are Alcatel, Ericsson,
Northern Telecom, Siemens, NEC, Fujitsu, and AT &amp; T.
Initially, China's State Council allowed only three of these multinationals
to form Sino-foreign joint ventures to manufacture switching equipment.
These were Shanghai Bell, which is an affiliate of Alcatel, a Beijing-based
joint venture by Siemens, and a company formed with Japan's NEC in Tianjin.
But other multinationals were unhappy at being frozen out. Under pressure
from the American government and lobbying by various companies, industry
sources said the Chinese Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications recently
agreed to ease restrictions on the lucrative switching market.
Northern Telecom recently concluded a Dollars 159m deal to sell switching
contracts to four Chinese provinces and expects to begin producing switching
equipment in Quangdong province in southern China by the end of the year or
by early 1994.
Earlier this year, AT &amp; T was also given permission to launch a joint
venture in Qingdao to manufacture switching equipment.
In February, AT &amp; T signed a far-reaching memorandum of understanding to
jointly develop manufacturing plants and research and development projects
in China's telecommunications industry.
The competition has intensified in the last year as customers have sought to
purchase equipment with more than just switching capability.
'Customers are looking for more and more high-tech products - and not just
pure switching capacity,' explains a western business executive.
'The customer is concerned with quality, performance and the different
functions of switching equipment.'
Industry sources report that Japanese suppliers, such as NEC and others,
have lost some market share to other foreign manufacturers in China in the
last year. They report that the top three foreign companies are Alcatel with
31.2 per cent of the market, Ericsson 23.6 per cent, and Northern Telecom
with 19.1 per cent.
As the market leader, Alcatel is the most aggressive. Its joint venture with
Shanghai Bell has more than trebled its design capacity of over 300,000
lines to produce more than two million lines last year. Alcatel also sold an
additional two million lines direct to various MPTs.
Alcatel has also been able to obtain soft loans from various European
governments for telecommunications purchases. Its Belgian subsidiary signed
a Dollars 250m loan with the Chinese in the spring. And the company's
Spanish subsidiary agreed to an even larger Dollars 500m deal for the
purchase of telecommunication switches.
Meanwhile, Ericsson has won a Dollars 300m contract to install 1.8m lines in
Guangdong over the next few years.
Demand is so great that Siemens has also doubled its original production
capacity in its Beijing operation from one million lines to 1.5m this year
and 2m next year. Last year the joint venture produced 370,000 lines.
Apart from switching equipment (or SPCs), another booming growth area is the
cellular mobile phone market.
'It's expanding so rapidly that you can't compare it with anything else in
the world,' says a business executive.
Ericsson and Motorola are the leaders of this market. Both have
manufacturing operations in China. Siemens has also recently announced it is
establishing a joint venture in Shanghai to produce radio handsets and
transmission equipment.
Though the cellular market is growing dramatically, industry sources say it
is still relatively small for the country's size.
Subscribers are still less than 300,000, although line capacity is about a
million. In comparison, Hong Kong, which has a population of 5.5m, has about
250,000 subscribers.
Mobile telephone subscriber costs are high in China. Subscriber fees are
about 25,000 renminbi (USDollars 4,386), but demand is still great for this
service, particularly in China's Pearl River Delta in Guangdong, and in the
country's rural hinterland.
Cellular phones are more attractive to many business customers because a
radio network can be installed more quickly than cables could ever be laid
for a conventional telephone system.
Other promising areas of growth include micro-wave equipment and optical
fibre cables to link China's more remote areas.
Optical fibre systems are increasingly being used for long distance
transmission in China because the quality of communications is said to be
better than that of microwav systems; and cable systems are less subject to
climatic interference. But microwaves still have some advantages over
optical fibre systems. For particularly long distances, the equipment
requires less time to installation time and causes less disruption in cities
where roads would need to be dug up to lay cables.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (9): Whirlwind of
change - Developments in the US - The US telecom scene is in rapid
transition with advances in technology, structural changes and intense
competition between service providers

TEN YEARS after the break-up of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph in an
anti-trust court settlement, the regulatory framework imposed then on the US
telecommunications industry is rapidly breaking asunder as the country
braces for the new world of multimedia, inter-active communications.
The sector is facing a period of extremely fast change, technologically and
structurally, which will produce both big winners and losers.
Under the 1984 settlement, AT&amp;T was divested of its local telephone
business, which was divided up into seven regional 'Baby Bell' operating
companies, each enjoying a monopoly in its own area. Because of their
monopoly status, these businesses were prevented from entering the
long-distance market, the manufacture of telecommunications equipment, and
information services.
The rump AT&amp;T business was left with its long-distance and equipment
manufacturing operations. However, the long-distance operations had to
compete against upstart rivals like MCI Communications on a much more level
playing field than before.
Technological change is starting to render these distinctions anachronistic.
In particular, the ability to translate video, audio and data information
into digital form and then transmit it along fibre optic lines is blurring
the distinction between the telecoms, computer and media businesses.
The biggest changes are taking place in the local telecommunications
industry where the monopolies enjoyed by the Baby Bells, as well as the
patchwork of non-Bell local telephone companies, are starting to come apart.
Several factors are at work here. One is the growth of so-called Competitive
Access Providers (CAPs) - companies which establish themselves in
metropolitan areas and operate highly efficient fibre optic networks,
creaming off bulk traffic from business customers.
The Federal Communications Commission, the government agency which oversees
the industry, has greatly increased the business potential of these firms by
giving them the right to inter-connect their networks with those of the
local telephone companies.
Another is the inroads being made by long-distance companies, which resent
the heavy access charges they have to pay local companies to complete the
last few miles of call. Many states are now starting to allow long-distance
carriers to compete in the lucrative market for intra-state medium distance
calls, once monopolised by the local companies.
An important development here occurred in August when California, the
largest telephone market in the nation, announced that it wanted to open up
these short-haul toll calls to competition.
Thirdly, the rapid growth of cellular telephone communication is breaking
down the monopoly, since it offers an alternative to the local phone
company's wired network. Admittedly, the regional Bell companies are among
the most important players in the cellular market, since each of them was
granted one of two cellular licences in their service areas when these were
handed out in the early 1980s.
However, they do face competition from independents ,which is likely to be
even stronger in the years ahead, following AT&amp;T's launch in August of a
Dollars 12.3bn agreed bid for McCaw Cellular Communications, the largest
cellular company in the US.
This deal has the Baby Bells particularly concerned, for they fear it will
eventually enable AT&amp;T to by-pass their lines, thus stripping them of part
of their huge access fees. They are complaining that it represents AT&amp;T's
return, after a 10 year absence, to the local service market, and they are
redoubling a campaign they have long waged to be allowed access to the
long-distance market.
They are also aggressively trying to improve their position on other fronts.
After years of lobbying, they managed in 1991 to get a relaxation of the ban
which prevented them entering the information services industry.
This prepared the way for Southwestern Bell, which serves Texas and
neighbouring states, to make the telephone industry's first big investment
in the cable television industry last February, when it agreed to buy two
cable systems in suburban Washington DC for Dollars 650m.
US West, which serves the Rocky Mountain states and Pacific Northwest, has
recently followed that up by making a Dollars 2.5bn investment in the cable
entertainment operations of Time Warner, the second largest cable operator
in the US and a leading producer of filmed entertainment.
The FCC has also helped the phone companies move into this area by agreeing
last year that they can provide ' video dial tone' - that is, the
transmission of television programmes over their own lines for third
parties. But the phone companies still face a big stumbling block to full
participation in the cable industry, since the 1984 cable act forbids them
to provide cable programming in areas where they also provide a phone
service.
Still, in a potentially important legal breakthrough, Bell Atlantic, the
phone company serving the mid-Atlantic region, won a court case in August
which could pave the way for it to offer cable television in its own area. A
US district court in Alexandria, Virginia, declared the provisions of the
1984 act unconstitutional, since they violated Bell Atlantic's right to free
speech under the first amendment to the US constitution.
The case seems set to go to appeal, but it is a clear indication of the way
barriers are tumbling.
The cable companies, for their part, are keen to muscle into the local
telecoms business. Many of the CAPs are owned by cable companies, some of
which are also developing plans to enter a new type of radio-based
telephony, personal communications systems (PCS), which is expected to begin
operating in the US over the next two to three years.
All this is putting big pressures on the local telephone companies to
improve their efficiency, through jobs cuts and re-organisation of their
working methods.
A recent example of the trend came in September, when US West announced
plans to cut 9,000 jobs, or 15 per cent of its workforce, as part of a
modernisation programme which will consolidate hundreds of local operating
centres into 26 regional ones. It was, said the company, a 'fundamental
response to competition that is here, and is going to evolve through this
decade.'

FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (11): Canadian
companies cry foul - Telecom re-sellers make big gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFFREY WHEELWRIGHT

<DATELINE>
   COMPETITION has come to the Canadian telecommunications industry
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
and the established players in this market are not happy about it.
Despite the presence of a conservative, deregulating government for the past
11 years, Canadian telephone companies have enjoyed nearly a monopoly in the
provision of domestic and business telephone services, almost from the very
moment Alexander Graham Bell, invented the telephone.
But over the past three years that has started to change. In 1990 the
government's telecoms regulatory body - the Canadian Radio and Television
and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) - allowed telecom resellers into
the market. Two years later it approved the entry of independent
competitors.
The idea for the resellers was simple: they were to be allowed to buy
long-distance telecom services in bulk from existing monopoly suppliers and
then resell them competitively in much smaller units to business and
residential customers.
The problem for Canada's existing telephone companies, however, was that
long-distance services were their bread and butter.
LONG-DISTANCE services have traditionally cost more in Canada than in the
nearby US, largely because long-distance profits have had to subsidise the
cost of local residential phone services.
The Canadian government has long kept a tight lid on the amounts that could
be charged to consumers for such services. The average Canadian home-owner
pays only about CDollars 15 (about USDollars 12.50) a month for their line
rental, and can make as many local calls as they like once that line rental
is paid. Realising that this might create problems, the government did force
resellers to put in a part of their profits to help subsidise local calling.
One of the reasons Canadian phone companies are now crying foul is that the
re-sellers need not contribute anything like as much of their profits to
support local calling services as the established Canadian phone companies
must.
For example, in British Columbia, Canada's westernmost province, the
long-time monopoly supplier British Columbia Telephone (BC Tel, as it is
known locally) must contribute, towards the cost of subsidising local calls,
20 cents out of the 35 cent per minute minimum charge on every
inter-provincial long distance telephone call.
Competitive re-sellers such as Cable &amp; Wireless Telecommunications, the
multinational telecom giant, or Cam-Net Communications, the Canadian
supplier, are only required by government to contribute between two and
three cents per minute.
These means that although BC Tel and the re-sellers are both making 15 cents
per minute on inter-provincial long-distance calls, BC Tel has to charge
customers 35 cents per minute - while re-sellers can make the same profit by
only charging as little as 17 cents per minute.
BC Tel and other Canadian telephone companies say that this
government-legislated encouragement to re-sellers is hitting them hard. BC
Tel estimates that it is losing some CDollars 70m alone in long-distance
business to resellers.
When the government unveiled its scheme to increase long-distance
competition three years ago, it estimated that resellers would only capture
about 2 per cent of the market. But by mid-1992, the re-sellers already
claimed some 6 per cent market share - and now have about 10 per cent.
The area where Canadian telephone companies are losing the most money is in
cross-border calls to the widely deregulated US. Using their leased bulk,
Canadian telephone lines re-sellers can not only sell consumers a cheaper
long- distance service within Canada, but they can route calls to the
nearest US city across the border - and then patch into the US and
international long-distance carriers.
There are more than 40 long distance telephone service resellers in Canada.
They are already claiming some 65 per cent of the Canada-US business long
distance telephone traffic - representing a staggering growth from their
entry into the market only three years ago.
But telecom resellers are no longer the only worry facing established
Canadian telecommunications providers.
IN 1992, the CRTC approved bids by two Canadian companies to provide
competitive long-distance telephone service throughout the country.
The two companies, Unitel Communications based in Toronto, and BCRL, based
in British Columbia (a telecom division of the provincially-owned BC Rail
corporation), were granted the right to start offering competitive telecom
services.
The value of the Canadian long distance telephone market is estimated at
about CDollars 7.5bn a year. Canada's existing telecom service providers did
not give up this monopoly without a fight, either.
As with the case of the re-sellers, Canadian phone companies argued that the
new players do not have to subsidise the cost of local phone calls (which
are still unlimited after a basic monthly line rate has been paid).
The CRTC has addressed this, however, by agreeing to a plan that will see
the new competitors pay in up to CDollars 11bn to assist in paying the cost
of local phone rate subsidies during the period in which the competition is
ramping up its business.
Two of the country's largest established phone companies, BC Tel and Bell
Canada, tried unsuccessfully last year to appeal the decision.
They claimed that initially competitors are not being be required to pay as
much toward subsidising local rates as they must - and that they have had to
pay up to 70 per cent of the CDollars 50m cost of re-engineering their
telephone networks so that their new competitors can more easily hook into
them.
According to Mr Brian Canfield, president and chief executive of BC Tel,
Canadians ignore the regulatory problems of their telephone companies at
their peril.
'The Canadian regulatory environment for telecommunications has served our
country's social policy needs very well in the past, creating a national
telecommunications network that is truly accessible to all,' he says.
'In British Columbia, telephone service is virtually universal - more than
98 per cent of our population is plugged into the (telephone) network.
Unfortunately, the same regulatory mandate responsible for this
accomplishment is becoming increasingly out of touch with reality.'
Mr Canfield evinces strong Canadian nationalist sentiment in defence of his
company's argument against the recent regulatory changes.
Current regulations leave Canada vulnerable to telecom providers 'who are
unencumbered by our regulations and who act solely in their own narrow,
short-term interests, with little thought to what is best for Canada,' he
adds.
Individually, none of Canada's big telecom service providers is large
enough, by world standards.
In revenue-terms, 'we are only half the size of British Telecom, only
one-third the size of AT&amp;T and only one-quarter the size of Nippon Telephone
and Telegraph,' he says.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (10): The market
hots up - In the US, Frank Lipsius watches the jockeying to gain consumers'
attention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK LIPSIUS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GINGERLY referring to a relationship that goes back to 1908, the American
Telephone and Telegraph Company insists that its advertising review is
routine. But since AT&amp;T lost its monopoly on American telephone lines and
telephones, its campaigns have taken on new importance.
One current Dollars 190m TV advertising pitch for AT&amp;T has gained the
embarrassing reputation for being 'confusing'. Even an AT&amp;T executive
admitted in print: 'I still don't get it,' referring to the 'i' plan - a
broad range of services that neglected to mention that the 'i' stood for
'individual.' Few people knew - even after seeing the commercials - what the
services were.
For AT&amp;T, giving up the advertising agency it has used since 1908 is just
one more petty humiliation being inflicted by its upstart rival MCI (of
which British Telecom recently bought 20 per cent for Dollars 4.3bn). MCI
has taken about 16 per cent of the market compared to AT&amp;T's 68 per cent,
and Sprint's (the third long-distance player), 11 per cent. MCI led the way
in offering a reverse-charges service using a toll-free 800 number, only to
be followed by AT&amp;T.
AT&amp;T has also lagged in touting services, such as discounts, to a customer's
most frequently dialed numbers.
Such jockeying for consumer attention does not come cheap. The journal
Advertising Age estimates that AT&amp;T spent Dollars 329m on measured
advertising in 1992, compared to MCI's Dollars 103m and Sprint's Dollars
87m. And while AT&amp;T's advertising fell by Dollars 24m from the year before,
both MCI and Sprint increased theirs; the former by almost Dollars 10m and
the latter, buttressed by a successful campaign featuring Candice Bergen,
the actress, by Dollars 17m.
One problem in advertising long-distance services lies in differentiating
the product. Besides sales gimmicks through selective discounts, the
campaigns emphasise Madison Avenue-inspired 'qualities' such as being able
to hear a pin drop on Sprint, or the negligible price difference between
AT&amp;T and MCI (negligible, so far as AT&amp;T is concerned). For its part, MCI
has run enormous electronic billboards, keeping track of the savings that
mount by the second in using its services.
These trivial squabbles mark only the beginning of the choices that will be
bombarding consumers in the increasingly diversified and competitive telecom
market.
By the time this particular telecom revolution hits its stride, customers
will be seeing more than just a lower long-distance phone bill. After
decades of being content with one or two telephones in the house, obsessive
consumers can keep themselves permanently available by telephone, while
companies can transmit information into a computer which that makes it
available around the world as it is being typed.
The humble house telephone is probably the first place most people are
seeing these technological changes affecting their lives. Subscribers to New
York Telephone are being offered services that give them more control over
phone intrusions. 'Call ID,' at Dollars 6.50 a month, shows the number of
the caller as the telephone rings; 'Call Return,' by dialling three digits,
calls back the last number on the line; and 'Repeat Dialling', costing the
same as Call Return at 75 cents, keeps on dialling until an engaged number
is free.
For the technologically literate, the latest fashion is for wireless systems
that began with car phones and soon shrank in size, allowing pedestrians and
restaurant patrons to have constant telephone companions. More than 12m
Americans have signed on to cellular systems - a figure expected to double
by the end of the decade.
Shadows over cellular's manifest destiny are the new band widths which the
US government now intends to auction for a high-frequency digital channel
devoted to PCS - 'personal communication services.' PCS combines fax,
telephone and modem, for personal and computer-to- computer contact.
The bidding for this space has created the only buoyant market in American
property - cellular band width. As Tom Wheeler, president of the Cellular
Telecommunications Industry Association, contends: 'It's the 21st century
equivalent of the Oklahoma land rush.'
MCI is betting on the new PCS technology because its digital transmission
solves the problems of the present generation of cellular service - problems
which cause 30 per cent of the customers to drop out every year because of
quality, cost or poor service.
To make the new short band width work, the PCS network may need transmitters
every 500 to 1,000 feet. This would be a daunting investment; it could
ultimately cost three competing systems a collective Dollars 22bn to install
by the time of inauguration in about 1997.
Capital outlays may discourage the faint at heart, but the brave can see
that new technologies breed new uses. Thanks to Motorola, the American
cellular manufacturing pioneer, even China has 3m people on a paging system
which transmits coded messages rather than giving a telephone number, using
numbers to mean 'return to office', 'go to post office,' and the like.
Businesses in Philadelphia have data entry done in South Dakota as if it
were in the next room. In the highly competitive data-transmittal business
that includes services from the big long-distance carriers, as well as Cable
and Wireless and CompuServe - best known for its on-line information service
 -some American data out-sourcing goes to the Caribbean. CompuServe's
network services division, with revenues approaching Dollars 400m a year,
does the online transmittal of Visa's 600m credit-card transactions and
verifications, among its other tasks.
As the technological revolution progresses, it will sweep up even its early
ally and progenitor, the humble house telephone. Already the new product
called 'pda', or 'personal digital assistant', packages computer data and
telephone service together.
The most advanced of these so far is AT&amp;T's EO, which includes a cellular
telephone with the services offered in common with its competitors Apple
Newton MessagePad, Sharp Expert Pad and Casio Z-7000. All three have
first-generation handwriting recognition.
At three times the Dollars 700 cost of the competitors' simpler models, the
EO 440 also sends and receives faxes.
Combining computer and telephone technologies creates an exciting future.
There will be many 'must-have' products among the huge range of
possibilities opening to the most adventurous, imaginative and skilled
telecom providers.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (8): Race to
supply new global services - Outsourcing / The range of services provided by
outsourcers is varied and growing. The staple diet includes managed data
network services, electronic data interchange facilities, short-dialling
options and electronic mail
</HEADLINE>

ONE WORD dominates discourse on the growth of international telecoms
operators: outsourcing.
The growth potential of the market for outsourcing the telecommunications
requirements of multinational companies and other large organisations is the
single most cited rationale for the international ambitions of the leading
telecoms operators.
There is little agreement on the size of the market. When AT&amp;T launched its
WorldSource initiative in May, it talked of 4,000 to 5,000 'target
multinationals'; a month later, at the inauguration of its Dollars 5.3bn
partnership with MCI, BT was touting a more conservative 400 to 500. Either
way, the numbers are large and the ambitions commensurate.
AT&amp;T and BT are best placed to become the foremost 'global' outsourcers.
Both have the cash to build and integrate global networks; both have
significant footholds in large markets in their own right; and both have the
wherewithal to attract the foreign partners necessary to meet the needs of
most multinationals.
AT&amp;T's international outsourcing venture, 'WorldSource,' is an alliance with
Japan's Kokusai Denshin Denwa and Singapore Telecom. Unitel of Canada,
Telstra of Australia and Korea Telecom are set to join soon.
The alliance is already in the market for outsourcing contracts embracing
the North American and Asia-Pacific regions. AT&amp;T is now trawling for
European partners with a view to a European launch next year. Suitors are
not lacking.
BT got off to a hesitant outsourcing start in the early 1990s with the
launch of Syncordia, a US-based venture dedicated to the job. The need for a
stronger US base became imperative, and it secured one this year with its
alliance with MCI, the largest US long-distance operator after AT&amp;T. The two
will spend around Dollars 1bn establishing a joint venture company, based in
Washington, to develop the global market.
Several regional groupings are in the market, too. The most significant are
Unisource, an alliance of the Swiss, Swedish and Dutch PTTs; and Eunetcom, a
consortium of France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom.
In addition, most national carriers have outsourcing ventures catering for
domestic companies. Cable and Wireless, the UK group, has an international
network of its own, so offers a far more than domestic service.
The range of services provided by outsourcers is growing - it typically
includes managed data network services, electronic data interchange
facilities, short-dialling options and electronic mail.
Most of the outsourcers are developing software tools to allow virtual
private networks to interwork and to support a common set of features such
as seven-digit dialling.
Total or partial network management is widely on offer, with operators
touting to take over complete ownership of private networks.
It is not just the familiar US multinationals that are in the market for
global outsourcers. BT won a milestone Pounds 400m contract last month with
Grupo Santander, Spain's fourth largest financial services group and parent
of Banco Santander.
The contract gives BT ownership and management of Grupo Santander's data
communications network covering 31 Spanish cities, which it will manage,
upgrade and use to offer a range of managed data communications services to
Spanish companies and other large customers.
Governments are also jumping on the bandwagon. Dedicated across much of the
world to the virtues of 'hiving off' the management of all but core state
responsibilities like the army and prisons (and sometimes even those),
governments are putting their own networks on the market. Some are looking
seriously at foreign operators, not just their national PTO, to take on the
job.
Meanwhile, the UK government has just tendered for its national
long-distance network, linking government offices. Mercury Communications,
the Cable &amp; Wireless subsidiary, won the contract. The runner-up was
Telstra, the state-owned Australian operator, which has a UK public telecoms
operator licence and is working hard to build up its business outside
Australia.
For Telstra, victory would have been particularly sweet, since BT recently
won the contract to run the New South Wales government's contract in
Australia.
Outsourcing is not a one-way unstoppable train. Last year Shell put its
telecoms network out to tender, stipulating that the outsourcer would have
to cut its communications costs. It withdrew the tender, reportedly because
all the bids came out more expensive than Shell's in-house operation. It is
having another go this year.
Meanwhile, the European Community has given a gold-plated gift to the
outsourcers, in the shape of its refusal to force member-states to open
their public 'voice' networks to competition before 1998.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (7): Starting
from scratch - Eastern Europe - The success of mobile communications
supports the 'leapfrog' theory that eastern Europe can skip generations of
development and leap to the latest technology
</HEADLINE>

   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BUDAPEST, circa 1990. The lead character of the film hears his wife has
given birth, rushes to a callbox and telephones the hospital. Wrong number:
cut to seductive girl at the other end of the line. Telephones - erratic
ones - are a staple of east European drama.
Not for much longer. State-of-the-art French card phones, some with
tone-dialling, are proliferating across Hungary's capital and taking the
romance out of telecommunications.
Modernisation is long overdue. Communist regimes, suspicious of free
communication and keen on more tangible economic output, bequeathed
creakingly inadequate telephone systems to their democratic successors.
East European countries average 10-20 lines per 100 inhabitants compared
with about 40 in western Europe. Some exchanges date back to the 1930s.
Visiting western engineers with a yen for telephone history beg for a
glimpse of the Jozsefvaros rotary switch in Budapest.
Economic liberalisation has put the telephone systems of the region - never
very sturdy - under even more strain. The foreign investors, private
entrepreneurs and foreign traders of the new market economy are
chatterboxes. The sheer volume of calls regularly overburdens telephone
systems across the region. One day this spring, telephones crashed across
parts of Prague and physical meetings came back into their own.
Each individual's inconvenience adds up to a heavy overall economic burden.
A survey by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) of east European companies showed that substandard telecommunications
was eastern Europe's most serious infrastructure obstacle to exports.
Rickety telephones have burdened, and deterred, foreign investors, too.
General Electric of the US blamed part of the 1992 loss at its Tungsram
lighting venture to the cost of establishing microwave links to its plant in
Nagykanizsa in western Hungary.
For all the grumbling about telephones - without which many a social
occasion in the region would be incomplete - development has begun.
Most countries in eastern Europe have - or are constructing - new
international switches, which enjoy a very rapid payback. The region's
telephone utilities are also installing new digital switches and fibre-optic
cable to create an overlay network for businesses, and to reduce the strain
on existing analogue services. Business users prepared to pay a premium can
now acquire a line of international quality in Prague, Budapest and several
other cities.
In this first phase, western manufacturers like Siemens, LM Ericsson,
Northern Telecom, Alcatel and AT&amp;T have moved in to supply equipment. Some
have been also been drawn into privatisations and joint ventures in order to
win contracts.
Nowhere is the link clearer than in Poland. The authorities and their
advisers Bain &amp; Co parcelled up the telecommunications equipment sector into
three parts for sale. Acquirers have preferential access to the Polish
market and the policy has induced AT&amp;T, Alcatel and - just last month -
Siemens to invest.
Investment, and western firms, have also focussed on mobile communications.
Hungary's recent tender for two concessions to operate GSM digital mobile
networks raised nearly Dollars 100m in fees and promises another Dollars
400m in spending on network development over 10 years.
US West, the regional Bell operating company, partnered national operator
Matav to gain one of two concessions. Pannon GSM, a consortium teaming
national operators from the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Finland, took
the second.
US West has been active elsewhere in the region, recently winning tenders to
develop digital mobile networks in 10 Russian cities. The company also has
stakes in existing analogue mobile concessions in Hungary and the Czech and
Slovak Republics.
In Poland, Ameritech of the US, France Telecom and local partners have
invested Dollars 120m in their Centertel joint venture. Meanwhile, various
Scandinavian operators are embarking on wireless communications development
in the Baltic republics. Further south in the former Soviet Union, Deutsche
Telekom, Telecom Denmark and PTT Netherlands have combined to provide mobile
phones in 21 Ukrainian cities.
Penetration by mobile services has been rapid with the longest established
provider, Hungary's Westel joint venture, serving 33,000 subscribers after
just three years. Average usage is several times that in the west: many
customers have no access to landlines and their mobile phone is their main
means of communication.
The relative success of mobile communications supports the 'leapfrog'
theory: that eastern Europe can skip generations of development and leap to
the latest technology - 'the only technical advantage which the Czech
Republic has in telecommunications is that we have to rebuild the
infrastructure almost from scratch,' says Mr Mihal Cupa, head of the
strategy section of national operator SPT Telecom.
The main effort, nevertheless, centres on the more prosaic task of providing
more landlines for a population which cannot afford high mobile phone
charges. And that is an expensive proposition.
A report by the OECD calculates that Dollars 129bn is need to bring average
line density to 35 per 100 by the new millenium. Some guesses put investment
needs are as high as Dollars 320bn.
Much of the funding must inevitably be local. Tariffs have increased sharply
in every east European country and the rise is likely to continue. Price
capping regulation, in Hungary at least, is expected to allow increases in
line with general inflation rather than following the West in subtracting a
few percentage points from the RPI.
International institutions, primarily the European Investment Bank, the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the World Bank, have
also favoured the telecommunications sector for lending.
But the indebtedness of local telecoms operators threatens to become
unsustainably heavy. Investment, moreover, is still proceeding far too
slowly for east European countries to approach west European
telecommunication standards by the year 2000. The shortfall, if it is to be
narrowed, will have to be made up by foreign equity investment.
The first powerful infusion is set to occur with the privatisation of more
than 30 per cent of Matav, the Hungarian state-owned operator. The leading
international telecoms operators bidding have until later this month to make
their offers. Already Deutsche Telekom of Germany has formed a consortium
with Cable &amp; Wireless of the UK and Ameritech of the US to emerge as the
leading contender. France Telecom and US West may make a rival bid, advisers
believe.
Hungary's telecoms privatisation may be eastern Europe's first but it will
hardly be its last. The Czech Republic has appointed JP Morgan, the US
investment bank, to advise on the sale of a minority stake of SPT Telecom,
the national operator, to outside investors.
But privatisation in eastern Europe is complicated by legal and regulatory
uncertainties - telecoms privatisation more than most. With less than a
month to go before the submission of bids for Hungary's telecoms
privatisation, it is still not clear how much the national operator will
have to contend with local competition. Nor is title to real estate
inherited from Hungary's former PTT clearly defined.
No wonder, then, that estimates of the worth of Matav vary wildly.
International Technology Consultants's valuation of Dollars 2,500 per line
gave the Hungarian operator a value of Dollars 3.3bn. But the figure is just
a starting point. ITC is the first to say that the privatisation format is
complex and the regulatory framework fluid.
Whatever the purchase price, investors will have to raise several billion
dollars for subsequent development of the network and it is this sum to
which the Hungarian authorities are paying the closest attention.
Hungary has already attracted about Dollars 5.6bn in foreign investment
since reforms began in 1988. And Mr Gyorgy Schamschula, Hungary's telecoms
minister, believes: 'With Matav's privatisation we have the opportunity to
attract as much foreign capital again as has come to Hungary so far.'
As that investment, and the inflow into the region as a whole, gather pace,
eastern Europe's unpredictable communist telephones will become a historical
curiosity. Few will mourn - apart from film scriptwriters, that is.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (6): Rapid
advances worldwide - Privatisation and liberalisation outside Europe - In
Latin America, telecoms privatisation is advancing at a speed that makes
Europe's progress appear positively glacial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEYOND Europe, privatisation and liberalisation are advancing wordwide in
the telecommunications industry. But they have many faces, and an array of
contrasting approaches are to be found.
The US (covered in separate articles on page 8 of this survey) is a world
unto itself, with its unique history of telecoms development and its
distinctive regulatory structure.
Since many of the strategic partners and inward investors shaping the
industry in other regions are US companies, particularly the regional Bell
operators, US practices are making themselves felt worldwide. This is
particularly true of the US propensity to test regulatory barriers and
licence conditions in the courts. But nowhere has it led to a private
operator regime as complex or confrontational as in the US.
Elsewhere, the most dynamic regions are Latin America and Asia-Pacific, with
China looming on the horizon and likely to dominate investment priorities in
the industry if its government proceeds with further telecoms liberalisation
 -see Asia reports on page 10 of this survey.
In Latin America, privatisation is advancing at a speed that makes Europe's
progress appear positively glacial. Most of the region's leading operating
companies have been privatised, or soon will be.
In Europe, state budget deficits are a prime factor in privatisations. In
Latin America, governments also want the cash; but privatisation has also
been treated as a prime vehicle for attracting strategic partners to take
the lead in building new lines and modsernising infrastructure as fast as
possible.
In the last few years, Argentina, Mexico, Chile and Venezuela have all sold
majority shares in their national telephone companies while Brazil, Uruguay,
and Costa Rica have privatisation programmes in the offing.
In all cases, modernisation was - and is - a more important concern than
competition; but pressure to liberalise is growing nonetheless.
Telmex, the inefficient Mexican state operator, was privatised as a monopoly
in 1991. According to Goldman Sachs, its licence binds it to achieving
average annual line growth of 12 per cent until 1995, and six per cent a
year from then to 2000. Barely 8 in 100 Mexicans haver a line at the moment.
From 1997 Telmex will face competition in the long-distance market.
CTC, Chile's national operator, has Telefonica, Spain's national operator,
as a strategic partner with a 44 per cent stake. Line growth in Chile is
expected to be a remarkable 23 per cent this year; long-distance traffic has
grown by 25 per cent a year since 1988. By the end of this year, CTC will
have an all-digital network.
In Argentina, two privatised operators, both with foreign partners, divide
the country between them. Stakeholders in Telecom Argentina, which has the
north of the country, include STET of Italy, France Cables and J P Morgan,
the investment Bank; Telefonica de Argentina is 60 per cent owned by a
consortium which includes Citicorp, the US bank, Banco Central and
Telefonica of Spain.
Venezuela's national operator, CANTV, was sold last year; 72 of the Dollars
1.89bn raised came from international companies participating in the
consortium that bought a controlling interest in the company. Spain's
Telefonica features yet again.
In Brazil, a political debate is raging over whether to abolish the state's
constitutionally-guaranteed telecoms monopoly over telecoms operation, seen
as an essential first step towards privatisation. Telebras, Brazil's
state-owned telecommunications holding company, has become the leading light
on the Sao Paulo stock exchange, thanks to foreign investors anticipating
opportunities to come.
Peru joins the privatisation league in December, when the country's two
state operators are to be sold off. Peru has one of the worst networks in
Latin American, with barely 2 lines per hundred people. If the sales go as
planned, the buyers will be obliged to invest Dollars 1bn to expand the
network overthe next five years. The monopoly will be left intact for five
years, on condition that the winning bidder doubles the number of lines in
that period.
Unsurprisingly, Telefonica is an interested party in Peru, along with AT&amp;T,
GTE and South-Western Bell of the US, the UK's Cable and Wireless, France
Telecom, STET of Italy and Korea Telecom. They are likely to form bidding
consortia with established equipment suppliers. such as Siemens, By
contrast, Asia-Pacific offers a more varied picture, with countries
positioned across a wide spectrum of development. However, in marked
contrast to Latin America, the strategic investor model has to date found
little favour anywhere in the region.
For the region's more developed countries, privatisation and liberalisation
are primarily intended to give a greater impetus to developing already
advanced networks.
Mr Andrew Harrington, telecoms analyst with Salomon Brothers in Hong Kong,
expects telecoms companies with a total market capitalisation of Dollars
70bn to be put up for sale in the region by the year 2000. Of that, around
Dollars 20bn will be available for investors.
'In 1990, there were only four companies you could buy: two in Japan, Hong
Telecom, and Philipines,' says Mr Harrington. 'Now there are in excess of
20, and the number will burgeon in the next decade.'
Singapore Telecom is the privatisation nearest on the horizon. The country
already has one of the most sophisticated telephone networks in the world:
it is looking to private investors largely to give it still greater dynamism
and international clout. State operators in Korea, Australia, Thailand,
Indonesia and India are all candidates to follow on - though in some cases
(notably Australia), governments are publicly denying the prospect.
In the region's developed countries, liberalisation is proceeding fast. In
Hong Kong, local services are to be liberalised from 1995. Japan, which
permitted competition as long ago as 1986, now has three long distance
carriers competing with NTT, two international carriers competing with KDD,
and four new cellular operators.
In Australia, Optus, the competitor to state-owned Telstra, benefits from a
favourable regulatory regime and is expected to have a 25 per cent market
share within five years. Even tiny New Zealand, which three years ago its
state carrier entire to a consortium led by Bell Atlantic and Ameritech of
the US, now has one competing long-distance operator and two new cellular
operators likely to set up in the next year.
For developing countries in the region, foreign investment is geared
primarily to building new lines. In most cases, monopolies have been
preserved, with overseas investors encouraged to contract to build lines as
a partner of the state operator, using 'build, operate, transfer' (BOT)
arrangements. In a few cases, notably the Philippines, a liberal regime has
been created for the job.
Thailand is the most significant BOT market. Japan's NTT has a stake in Thai
Telephone and Telecom, a private company with a BOT contract to build 1m
lines in the provinces. TelecomAsia, a consortium in which Nynex, the US
operator, has a 15 per cent stake, is contracted to build 2m lines in the
region.
'This could be the model for many future ventures,' says Mr Arthur Troy of
Nynex, TelecomAsia's chief operating officer. 'For us, it's a novel form of
operation, but seems to be working well.'
India is sharing in the novelty. This summer its government granted US West
a Dollars 100m contract to build a telephone network in a south Indian town,
in a move widely seen as the first nail in the coffin of the state's
telecoms monopoly.
In the Philippines, four predominantly overseas consortia are constructing
networks - which they will own as well as operate. Between them they will
install some 3m new lines - in a country which currently has only 900,000
lines. Three new cellular networks are also under construction.
The BOT model has obvious attractions for other developing regions, notably
Africa. Kenya, Nigeria and the Sudan are all considering telecoms
privatisation programmes, under the tutelage of the World Bank. By they time
they get there, state-owned national telecoms operators may be as
old-fashioned as much of their telephone networks.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (4): Beset by
political wrangles - German privatisation plans / Deutsche Telekom's ability
to invest abroad is hampered by its strained financial situation
</HEADLINE>

FOR two years, German political parties have been haggling about Deutsche
Telekom, the greatest plum in the slow-moving German privatisation process.
So far, all that has emerged is a four-page document which is expected to be
submitted to parliament this autumn.
Inter-party agreement is essential, in order to secure the special
parliamentary majority required to amend the German constitution, which
defines telecoms as the responsibility of the federal state.
The opposition Social Democrats (SPD) were not enamoured of the initial plan
put forward by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition; to win them over, the
government has had to agree an awkward, vaguely-worded compromise.
The government's objectives are clear - and echo the pleas of Deutsche
Telekom itself. First, the operator urgently needs private-sector funding to
see through its heavy investment in eastern Germany.
Second, privatisation is essential to reduce the operator's public
administration fat, to enable it to compete successfully in the liberalising
European telecoms market.
Since reunification, Deutsche Telekom, which has a turnover of DM54bn, has
been been charged by the government with upgrading the entire basic
telephone network for eastern Germany's 7.2m phone users. The company also
plans to install 5m cables for television connections, lines for 400,000
faxes and 70,000 public telephones. In total, it has committed DM60bn worth
of investments in the east by 1997. Its debt, which stands at DM100bn, is
expected to rise to DM140bn by 1995.
'We need DM20bn to DM30bn of new equity if we want to continue out
investments in the east,' Mr Helmut Ricke, Deutsche Telekom's forceful chief
executive, says bluntly. Mr Ricke, who has openly campaigned for
privatisation for two years, stresses the restrictions imposed by the state
of the German budget.
'When we go to the finance ministry for funds, they tell us they have the
same problem,' he says.
Mr Ricke is further concerned that the company's ambitions to expand are
limited by its public administration status which legally forces it to cover
the deficits of the German post and postal bank. Last year, Deutsche Telekom
had to hand over DM1.5bn to the two loss-making enterprises out of its
annual DM6.45 annual profits. It is also forced by law to hand over 10 per
cent of its revenues to the state budget each year.
The company's sales rose by 14.3 per cent in 1992, due mostly to eastern
Germany. However, it argues it should no longer have to transfer a fixed
percentage out of its gross revenues, pointing to its declining profits
which fell in 1992 by 10.4 per cent from DM7bn the previous year.
Its hands tied at home, Deutsche Telekom is worried about it ability to be a
global telecoms player. The company has been anxiously watching the progress
of its private competitors in Britain and the US.
'There is a simple formula,' says Mr Ricke. 'When the world changes in the
right direction, and I believe private companies can offer better services
to their clients, one must follow it.'
But Deutsche Telekom's ability to invest abroad is hampered by its strained
financial situation in Germany, he adds. Referring to large joint-ventures
between competitors, Mr Ricke says: 'Even if we had wanted to do such a
thing, we would not have the means to do it.'
As for the government, it is eager to remove the cost of rebuilding
infrastructure in the east from the Treasury. And the proceeds from the
privatisation, which will be partly used to repay for the prior
recapitalisation of the company, could help fill a few gaps in the finances
of the federal government itself.
However, the path to privatisation is tortuous because of objections voiced
by the Social Democrats, who are opposed to the establishment of a private
company not subject to state control. Mr Peter Paterna, one of party's
leading opponents of 'classical' privatisation, argues that a private
Deutsche Telekom will betray the much-vaunted German concept of the Burger
Post - the idea of post and telecoms as a utility for all citizens. SPD
opposition to privatisation is strengthened by its close links with the
600,000 Post Trade Union, which embraces the telecoms industry. The union is
fighting to preserve the employment status of its members, who as civil
servants enjoy special rights such as life employment and generous pensions.
While civil servants cannot by law be fired, a partly private Deutsche
Telekom could implement incentive compensation schemes to discourage poorly
performing employees.
Early retirement programmes for civil servants could also figure in the
company's restructuring programme, which plans to eliminate up to 30,000
jobs in the next fews years from its current 230,000 employees.
Compelled to compromise with such demands, the government's four-page
document proposes to turn Deutsche Telekom and the post bank into three
separate joint stock companies, with a holding company overseeing them.
In the case of Deutsche Telekom, the government will retain a 51 per cent
stake until monopolies are removed in Europe. It is expected to reduce its
stake to a minority share thereafter. The holding company will have
'supervisory and co-ordinating' powers over the joint-stock companies. These
powers could extent to 'duties concerning the infrastructure,' a response to
the SPD's demand that remote regions are not treated less favourably than
urban centres.
Moreover, its specifies that wage agreements will be decided at the holding
company level, thus allowing the trade union to retain greater wage
bargaining power than if wages were decided in the three separate
enterprises.
These clauses have raised concern about the future ability of Deutsche
Telekom to act unhindered from state control.
'I am not sure how a law could encompass all the contradictions in this
document,' complains Mr Frerich Gorts, former state secretary at the post
and telecoms ministry and charged with writing the bill this summer. 'I
cannot turn black into white'.
But the government is determined to oversee the contradictions in the
document and draft the bill. It is counting on that resistance within the
SPD to privatisation is fading in the wake of the decision by the European
Community to pry open monopolies and liberalise telecoms in Europe by 1998.
For liberalisation has opened the prospect that Deutsche Telekom could lose
out in the telecoms competitive battles. Already, Mannesmann, the German
engineering group and Deutsche Telekom's newly-arrived competitor in the
cellular mobile field, has gained a 50 per cent market share on a digital
network installed last year in the country.
Much will depend the attitude of hard-line Social Democrats in parliament
this winter. The retirement at the end of the year of Mr Emil Block, the
vice president of the post trade union and flag-bearer of the hard-liners,
could herald a further softening in the opposition's stance.
If the bill goes through quickly, the company is hoping for a first tranche
of its shares to be floated by 1996. The issue could be worth Dm15bn,
according to Mr Ricke and independent analysts. If parliament rejects the
bill, such a move could be delayed by a couple of years.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (5): Imitations
abound - UK policies / Britain is one of the world's foremost
telecommunications 'laboratories,'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK's policies on competition and privatisation in telecommunications are
being imitated worldwide, while the fate of new services - particularly the
growing price war in the country's cellular mobile industry - are of global
significance.
It is nearly a decade since the privatisation of British Telecommunications
and the licensing of Mercury Communications, a subsidiary of Cable &amp;
Wireless, as a national competitor. C&amp;W, itself privatised only three years
previously, was an established operator in the territories of the former
British empire, but had previously done little in the UK.
Competition got off to a limp start. Using railway lines for the most part,
Mercury's network construction proceeded slowly. It made no early bid for
the consumer market. Although it rapidly gained a sizeable business
clientele - more than half of the City of London's outgoing traffic is now
carried by Mercury - concerns about reliability and range of service
restricted growth.
At home, BT is still a Goliath. It carries around 90 per cent of the UK's
telecoms traffic. With the third and final tranche of government shares in
BT sold this summer, the only government check on its activities comes from
Oftel, the UK's telecommunications regulator. Over the past decade Oftel has
contained BT's prices but left it with fat profits, which it is now using to
establish itself as a giant abroad - most recently through a Dollars 5.3bn
deal giving it 20 per cent of MCI, the second largest US operator, and the
lion's share of a joint venture set up by the two companies.
However, BT's home base may soon be under siege. Mercury is making a
determined bid for the domestic market: as yet it has only 375,000 domestic
subscribers (against BT's 20m-plus), but with improved access terms, and new
packages enabling people to subscribe without purchasing a special phone, it
is growing rapidly. And Mercury is not the only challenger. Two years ago
the government ended the BT/Mercury duopoly established in 1984, and
guaranteed for the medium term by ministerial assurances given at BT's
privatisation. Instead, the government announced its readiness to license
new public operators, either building their own networks or retailing
services provided over existing networks.
Furthermore, it allowed cable companies, with franchises in urban areas, to
build combined TV and telephony networks - and to encourage them to do so,
it banned BT from offering entertainment services over its existing network
for at least ten years.
BT deeply resents the ban, and is planning a video-on-demand service to test
its extent. But it appears to have had the desired effect: 27 companies, 20
of them North American, are currently building combined TV/telephone
networks in 62 conurbations, with licences for another 65. They already have
185,000 customers between them, more than treble the tally a year ago.
As for public telecommunications licences, 22 have been granted in the past
two years. Most of them are for providers of specialised or regional
services, including several overseas companies. But two companies have
licences to build national networks: Energis, a subsidiary of the National
Grid, the company which operates the national network of high-voltage
pylons, is erecting an optical-fibre network on the pylons in barely two
years; while Ionica, a private company, is building a radio network.
Faced with new competition from all sides, BT's market share is bound to
suffer. The key question is whether between them BT and the new operators
can grow the market sufficiently to reduce BT's dominance while increasing
its turnover and profits.
The same question is hanging over the UK's cellular mobile industry, where
Vodafone, the world's largest independent cellular operator, and Cellnet, a
joint venture between BT and Securicor, are facing pressure on prices for
the first time since the launch of their networks in the 1980s.
By developed world standards, the UK's take-up of cellular phones is
unexceptional, with a take-up rate lower than the US and Scandinavia but
higher than most of the EC. Nor is the UK much of a technology testing
ground: the GSM standard (adopted for two of its new digital services) is
pan-European, while the PCN standard (adopted for the other two) has also
been adopted by Germany and looks sets to extend elsewhere.
However, the competitive pressures emerging in the UK cellular industry,
while still some way short of those in Hong Kong, are more than a match for
most of the rest of the world.
Until this year, Vodafone and Cellnet carved up the market between them,
making profits equal to more than 40 per cent of sales. The launch last
month of Mercury One-2-One, the first of two licensed PCN networks, looks
set to end that once and for all.
One-2-One astonished the industry by offering free local calls to domestic
subscribers in the evenings and at week-ends, in a determined bid to put
mobile phones on the consumer map for the first time. That came on top of a
tariff structure which offered substantial discounts on Vodafone and Cellnet
tariffs - albeit limited by the fact that One-2-One's network currently
covers only the London area.
Despite the marketing hype, for the moment One-2-One will have only a modest
appeal to domestic consumers because of the cost of handsets (at least
Pounds 250) and monthly subscriptions (between Pounds 12.50 and Pounds 20).
But One-2-One has already forced Vodafone and Cellnet to reduce their
peak-rate London tariffs by 40 per cent, and to cut low-user tariffs aimed
at the domestic market.
With Hutchison set to launch another PCN service next spring, and Cellnet
due to launch its digital service at the same time, competition will soon be
taken to a still higher plane. That, plus the expected fall in digital
handset prices, places the mass consumer market perhaps only two or three
years away.
Given the intensity of competition, it could come sooner in the UK than in
most of continental Europe. However, the cellular sector highlights a
remarkable paradox in the UK's telecom industry. Its service sector is
thriving, but its manufacturing base is non-existent.
All its suppliers are overseas companies. The wire-line sector is going the
same way, with GPT now the only sizeable indiginous supplier - and GEC, its
parent, has sold half of that to Siemens, with the other half generally
expected to follow in due course.
The British disease - all services, no manufacturing - or a tragic missed
opportunity? Either way, the die is cast.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (7): Development times
cut / A look at changes in attitudes in the motor industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINCE THE late 1980s, the motor industry has in effect abandoned the notion
that the wholesale application of computer-controlled automation and
robotics might be the best way for the west to manufacture cars
cost-effectively against Japan's hard-working labour forces and lower social
overheads.
For a period, what was then Europe's largest automotive group, Fiat, did
indeed believe that such an approach would provide the definitive answer to
the Japanese.
Out of that conviction grew Fiat's massive Cassino plant, not far from
Naples, where Tipo and Uno models have been built with a degree of
automation unmatched elsewhere before or since.
An army of automated transfer lines and Comau robots - built by Fiat's own
robotics subsidiary - stamps and assembles pressings carried on integrated
computer-guided transport systems, paints bodies, assembles the car interior
from modules - and even fills the tank at the end of the production process
with the correct grade of fuel.
But just as Volkswagen found with its venture into extreme automation, 'Hall
54' at Wolfsburg, Cassino has proved too inflexible.
Manufacturers are having to diversify their product ranges to cater to the
whims of ever more demanding consumers, and for the same reason car life
cycles have had to shorten.
Not only did Cassino, in the end, fail to yield the hoped-for productivity,
its rigidities have looked increasingly out of place in an industry ever
more concerned with the human resources aspects of Japanese-inspired 'lean'
manufacturing and how to utilise simultaneous engineering principles to
bring products more quickly and competitively to market.
Fiat, too, has seen the flaws in the Cassino concept.
Melfi, its new plant in the south of Italy to produce the Punto small car on
which Fiat's future heavily depends, exemplifies Fiat's new theology of the
'integrated factory', which it has begun to test out selectively at its
plants in the past 18 months.
'Cassino was focused on 'hard' issues, Melfi is about 'soft' issues,' says
Mr Paolo Cantarella, Fiat Auto's chief executive.
'The integration of man and machine is different at Melfi. It is about how
to organise activities, to involve people, to train them and keep them
motivated to the job, rather than how to put the wheel on the car. We know
how to do that,' he adds.
But they will be organising these activities with a sophisticated array of
computers. For computer systems have now permeated every aspect of the motor
industry, from first concept to delivery of vehicle to dealer and the flow
of service and repair parts.
This applies from the largest companies such as General Motors and Ford to
smaller and medium-size companies including the UK's Rover group.
Rover has spent Pounds 200m at its Cowley complex in Oxfordshire to create
what it claims to be one of Europe's most compact and flexible car plants.
Among Rover's prime concerns has been to introduce the team working,
multi-skilling, flexibility, kaizen (continuous improvement) and cultural
attitudes among its workforce that are now recognised as lying at the heart
of Japanese 'lean' manufacturing success in the motor industry.
But to this workforce, the four inter-related systems which control the main
plant processes are servant, not master. The build control system (BCS),
itself triggered by computer-generated dealer orders, tracks bodyshells
through all stages of manufacture by camera-reading bar-coded tags.
The painted body store management system releases the shells onto the
assembly line according to batch requirements. A third system controls the
movement of components within the distribution centre and on-site storage
areas to provide just- in-time line deliveries. A component identification
system ensures correct fitment of components which look alike but which are
specific to a particular vehicle application.
All of these systems work in 'open' mode, which allows information on them
to be accessed by any employee. The control computers are also linked to a
messaging system that can be used to give essential information to employees
throughout the facility.
It is in the visualisation of new design possibilities, however, that the
motor industry has made some of its most valuable advances with computers.
Ford, for example, is rapidly becoming heavily reliant on its Design
Computer System, with which it has been working since 1990.
The most important DCS underlying function, as with most computer technology
in the motor industry, is significantly to reduce product development times.
It allows construction, manufacturing, project planning and other divisions
to be closely involved with a model programme at the earliest design phase.
was developed at Ford's Merkenich research and development centre at
Cologne; that for interior design in Ford's similar centre at Dunton in the
UK, with which Merkenich is connected directly.
Together, they allow the concept designer to produce three-dimensional
designs on-screen which provide both a mathematical and geometrical
computational basis for technical designers. Of major importance in the
process is the generation of life-size, photo- graphic-quality images which
can also be evaluated subjectively.
The system had also to allow early access to design information for
manufacturing purposes, and to provide for the instant display of
corrections and alternatives in order to accelerate decision-making.
Thus, separate paintbox, high-resolution video and three-dimensional
computer modelling systems were integrated to form DCS.
The designer's electronic pen produces a photographic quality drawing on
screen, with the concept vehicle's shape colour and proportions open to
almost instant change - for example during a presentation.
Crucially, the system is also capable of memorising a sequence of such
'drawings' and turning them into a rotatable, 'real life' presentation of
the proposed vehicle, allowing judgments to be made of its styling and
proportions previously possible only by making time-absorbing mock-ups.
This is done with the further aid of CDRS (conceptual design rendering
system), creating a three-dimensional model of the vehicle body, all the
data for which is available for computer aided manufacturing decisions.
Ford executives at Merkenich calculate that the system reduces the 'clay
model' phase by three months because most of the models previously made for
visual evaluation are no longer necessary. Models of both the vehicle
exterior and interior can be machines directly from the database in a
variety of materials.
Even the computer-aided engineering processes by which the vehicle's
structural integrity is analysed can be completed at a far earlier stage
than previously.
Before DCS' introduction, Ford designers generated the initial
two-dimensional design of a future car on paper. This would be amended as
felt necessary by approval committees and only then used as the basis for an
initial clay model.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (8): A landmark in
technology - Aerospace components
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MIKE FARISH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FOUR wheels on the main landing gear of the new Airbus A330/340 aircraft
are fastened to the leg of the undercarriage by a highly-stressed 'bogey
beam' containing numerous complex curved surfaces.
For Airbus it represents an effective lightweight solution to the task of
supporting the landing force of a 257-tonne aircraft. For Dowty Aerospace
Landing Gear of Gloucester, which supplies the beam as part of a Pounds 300m
contract for the whole A330/340 landing gear, the beam represents a landmark
in its development and use of advanced design and manufacturing technology.
According to Mr Chris Morgan of Dowty, who played a leading role in the
development project, the beam was 'the first major component' that the
company has produced purely electronically, without any physical mock-ups
during the whole programme.
As such, the beam represents a key element in the engineering strategies
that Dowty and other aerospace companies are implementing in pursuit of
their business aims.
At Dowty, Mr Morgan is engineering group leader for new projects and is in
charge of developing the company's use of computers in a change programme
that got under way two years ago.
The aims are to introduce concurrent engineering, in other words the
simultaneous execution of previously sequential tasks, as a normal working
practice and support the development of advanced, low-weight landing gear
designs.
An essential requirement, he says, is to make 3D computer modelling the
standard way of carrying out design work and to integrate design software
with the various specialist analysis packages, such as finite element
programs, used by the company.
The company is therefore phasing out use of its old Graftek CAD software and
stepping up use of the Catia software marketed by IBM. It has also invested
Pounds 250,000 in new workstation hardware - IBM Risc and Hewlett-Packard
machines - so that all its design and analysis software now runs in a
uniform Unix-operating environment and data can be transferred between
different programs easily and quickly.
Such internal data transfers use the IGES (Initial Graphics Exchange
Specification) translation software, though in a version 'flavoured'
slightly to Dowty's own needs. Consequently, says Mr Morgan, computerised
finite element analysis is now an everyday tool rather than an occasional
resource for particularly complex tasks.
Modern workstation hardware also runs the Command CNC (Computer Numerical
Control) software package that now drives shopfloor machine tools. The
company's main manufacturing-related investment, however, has been in a new
Pounds 45m plant in Canada where other parts of the A330/340 landing gear
are made.
Elsewhere in the industry similar strategies and achievements are in
evidence. Rolls-Royce Aeroengines in Derby has spent Pounds 10m over the
last four years installing some 700 Unix workstation platforms - this time
Sun and Silicon Graphics machines.
The aim, as Mr Derek Gale, head of engineering systems, makes clear, is
again 'integration', with the objective of cutting total engine development
times by one third. Nevertheless, he says that the company has had to trim
back investment in the recession and that the policy has been one of
'minimum' necessary investment.
Ultimately, the company wants all 4,000 of its engineering staff to have
their own terminals, though some of them will be able to make do with PCs.
An equally significant long-term goal is the introduction of full
engineering data management, in effect the integration of all business and
technical information. This will enable the company to have every bit of
information about 'every engine going out of the door' in a single database.
One difference between Rolls-Royce and Dowty, however, is the former's much
more guarded attitude towards standardised data transfer by means such as
IGES. Rolls-Royce prefers to use a series of customised links to integrate
its design and analysis programs.
This lack of uniformity is also evident in the area of design data exchange
between aircraft and engine builders and both their customers and component
suppliers. Unlike the car industry where computerised data exchange is
virtually the norm, there has been little concerted effort in this
direction.
Instead, there is a mix of data transfer between identical CAD systems,
dissimilar systems using IGES and a still heavy reliance on the use of paper
drawings. A major reason is the establishment of de facto communications
standards for specific areas of aircraft based on particular proprietary CAD
systems.
Dowty's adoption of Catia, for instance, was prompted by the fact that the
software was already widely used for landing gear design.
Unsurprisingly, the techniques now being pioneered in the civil aircraft
industry are also being thoroughly exploited in the military world.
The latest version of the Harrier jump-jet, the T10, due to make its maiden
flight very shortly, has been developed jointly by British Aerospace and
McDonnell Douglas in the US. BAe has had responsibility for the complete
rear half of the fuselage and, according to Mr Gary Smith, group leader for
CAD applications for the company's Military Aircraft Division at
Farnborough, modelled the structure completely in 3D computer form.
That enabled the design team to calculate the lengths of cable and wire
running through the section 'with 99.9 per cent accuracy'.
Previously, it would have been necessary to build a full-size wooden mock-up
or even buy in a real fuselage section. BAe would adopt the same approach,
Mr Smith adds, even for a completely new aircraft development project.
At the manufacturing level the use of computer-controlled machine tools fed
with information directly from the design database is now standard
technology. The real differentiating factor between companies is how
effectively they organise their use of the technology and link it to
streamlined working practices.
Short Brothers in Belfast, for instance, which is now making major
structural components for several customers including Boeing, is currently
three-quarters of the way through a Pounds 200m investment programme that
will completely modernise all its production plant.
It is also using a software system called Matrix, developed jointly with
AT&amp;T Istel, that helps maximise the utilisation of individual pieces of
equipment.
Mr Russell MacFadden, manufacturing engineering director for aircraft, says
the investment has been linked with a reorganisation of the company into a
series of 'mini-businesses' in which semi-autonomous manufacturing units act
as suppliers of business units, concentrating on the needs of particular
customers.
All development projects are now carried out by multi-disciplinary
'design-build teams' and the company has invested more than Pounds 5m in
training to support the necessary 'culture change'. In parallel, it has
reduced the number of its component suppliers from around 100 to 14. Future
developments will see suppliers becoming full members of project teams.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (3): A triumph
for the EC's liberal conscience - Impact of liberalisation - Europe's
business community seems to take a simple view about telecom services, the
more competition, the faster, the better
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
FOR EUROPE'S telecommunications industry, the red-letter day of the decade
is January 1, 1998. That is the deadline agreed by the European Community
for exposing existing voice telephony operators to competition in their home
markets.
From one perspective, agreement on the 1998 deadline was a triumph for the
European Community's liberal conscience, championed in this instance by
Britain, the Netherlands and the European Commission's own
telecommunications directorate.
Mr Michel Carpentier, head of the directorate since 1983, is wont to remind
visitors that is only two years since France, Spain and Italy were mounting
legal challenges in the European Court of Justice to Commission's powers to
liberalise the markets for telecoms equipment and specialised services.
In practice, however, telecoms competition is an idea whose time has come,
and the question facing the EC ministers in June was when and how, not
whether.
Indeed, the competition is already there. Although most of the EC's Public
Telephone Operators (PTOs) formally retain their domestic fixed-line
monopolies, the monopoly is being eroded by the month.
Almost all EC countries now have competing cellular mobile services. Whereas
the first generation of analogue cellular services were mostly provided by
PTOs as monopolies, in most EC states licences for new digital services
built to the pan-European GSM standard have been given to two operators,
generally the PTO and one private consortium, the latter often including
overseas companies.
In Germany, three digital networks are coming on stream: Deutsche Telekom
has only one, and that is now operated a free-standing subsidiary of the
parent company.
The Commission has undertaken to publish, by January 1995, a paper on mobile
and personal communications. However, the most important decisions have been
taken, and a liberalised European market is already in existence.
It is the same story in data services, where liberalisation is advancing by
stealth. Even in the 'voice' market, call-back and other business
arrangements are eroding de facto monopolies.
They are also forcing PTOs to bring prices for long-distance and
international calls down towards cost, so undermining - for PTOs and
governments alike - the political and financial advantages of preserving the
state telecoms monopoly.
However, all is not as straightforward as it might seem: 1998 is only one
stage in the liberalisation process, and the EC's June 16 accord raised as
many questions as it answered.
The 1998 deadline applies only to eight countries; Spain, Ireland, Greece
and Portugal, judged to have 'less developed networks', have been granted an
extra five years' grace. Separately, 'very small networks' will have two
years extra 'where justified.'
Then there is the question of licensing new entrants. Post-Maastricht, an EC
version of the Federal Communications Commission is out of the question;
regulation will come from national agencies, with an initial steers and
periodic prods thereafter from Brussels. There will nonetheless need to be
co-ordination of policies on the licensing of new entrants, particularly the
larger US operators whose ambitions send shivers down many the spines of
many PTO directors.
Are licences issued in one country to be recognised automatically in others?
If not, why not?
These questions, hypothetical at the moment, will be only too pressing
should the UK government grant AT&amp;T a PTO licence in the next year.
THE June 16 accord contains but one sentence on the subject: 'The opening of
the Community telecommunications market for third countries should be linked
to comparable access to such countries' markets.'
Another critical, but unresolved, issue is that of infrastructure. The June
accord envisages competition between operators over the public network. It
deliberately side-stepped the vexed question of whether operators should be
able to build new networks - either to operate themselves, or to lease out
to others.
The EC will publish a Green Paper on infrastructure by January 1995. It will
also look at the future of cable TV networks - which is integrally linked
with infrastructure, since cable companies offering combined TV and
telephony services is one way of securing competing fixed-wire
telecommunications networks quickly.
The infrastructure debate looks to be going the same way as the 'voice'
debate: by the time the EC decides a policy, liberalisation will be all but
inevitable. The UK has already liberalised.
The Netherlands government is considering a plan to licence its railways,
cable companies and utilities to provide a national network to compete
against its PTO, which is to be privatised next year.
Finland - outside the EC, but a telecoms pace-setter - has licensed a second
national network, comprising existing regional operators.
There are already indications from Germany that infrastructure will be
liberalised at the same time as voice services. If it makes an early
announcement to that effect, the EC will be no more than a rubber stamp.
However complex the negotiations and processes, Europe's business community
seems to take a simple view: the more competition, the faster, the better.
A survey of 500 senior executives across Europe, carried out over the summer
by the Harris Research Centre on behalf of BT, found 60 per cent saying that
telecoms was the industry they most wanted to see liberalised.
Almost three-quarters would consider changing their supplier, while 79 per
cent did not agree that doing so would be an 'unnecessary risk' to their
business. The greatest resistance to change came from French and Swedish
executives, only a fifth of whom would consider changing operator.
By contrast, 94 per cent of Italians said they were ready to switch. And
virtually everyone - including 85 per cent of the French - thought that
liberalisation would improve the range of services on offer.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (6): Areas ripe for
technology - Where would software have most effect in the textile industry?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLOTHING and textiles are industries unlike those that make canned soup or
assemble motor cars.
Two hundred years ago, they were the first to be industrialised. They still
have their roots in craft industries and parts of them remain to this day
highly labour-intensive.
Most important of all, they are vertically integrated. Europe's biggest
textile company, Coats Viyella, for example, makes thread, cloth and
garments and retails them too. It is as if Ford owned British Steel and
Shell's service stations.
Perhaps not surprisingly, then, the challenge confronting textiles and
clothing executives is as much where to computerise as how to do it. In the
1990s, they have the possibility of introducing computers into just about
any link in the manufacturing chain.
Computers are even used at the very start of the process. More than a year
before a cotton shirt is bought by a consumer, a computer model of plant
development helps US cotton growers maximise yield and quality.
After harvesting, the cotton is then sent to depots where a software
package, developed by a company owned by the cotton growers, helps to choose
a suitable blend of raw fibres. By selecting combinations of fibre
characteristics, such as thickness and length, the qualities of the eventual
yarn can be determined.
The software is linked to cotton mill storage areas. It directs the
placement on the warehouse floor of different cotton bales. The automatic
machinery that picks up the bales in a preprogrammed sequence and takes them
to be blended into the raw material for yarn making.
As well as helping determine the feel of the yarn and cloth to be made, the
software helps determine its strength, a critical element in setting the
speed of spinning and weaving machines.
The idea may be extended beyond cotton, if a European Community-funded
project now under way comes to fruition. It aims to allow clothing designers
to specify the characteristics of the cloth and ask a computer to tell them
the best way of making it.
The clothing designer will be offered a range of routes to achieve a given
fabric performance without recourse to the expense and time involved in
selecting fibre, yarns, weaving finishing and testing samples.
As well as cutting design costs, it could simplify the production cycle,
improve quality - important for developed countries in competition with low
labour-cost rivals - and even help introduce new fabric ideas and clothing
constructions.
In the long chain of production involved in making clothes, the stage after
yarn selection is weaving or knitting. Like other manufacturing processes,
they have already seen the introduction of computers for monitoring and
process control.
But several areas remain that are ripe for the introduction of the latest
high speed computer technologies.
Once the cloth is made, it must be inspected. This is still usually done by
a worker looking at the cloth as it rolls by. Even in the latest factories,
such as Toray's polyester plant in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, fabric
inspection needs the human eye. Some clothing makers duplicate the effort
and employ staff to scan the rolls of cloth looking for imperfections.
UK consultancy Era Technology is working on an automatic inspection system
that would automatically alert machine operators to the presence of defects.
It hopes to extend the principle to the monitoring of leather, paper,
printing and footwear sectors.
This kind of procedure, as with most image-based analysis, relies on
high-powered electronics. The ERA systems uses parallel processing
integrated circuits in an array of TMS320C40 digital signal processing
chips. This in turn feeds information into Transputer chips for analysis.
Cloth design is also being done increasingly on computers. At
Nottingham-based Sherwood Group, one of Europe's largest lace manufacturers,
for example, designers have forsaken pen and ink for the power of
computer-aided design (CAD).
In the US, CAD is being used to create fabric print designs. It goes a stage
further than Sherwood's system because it links the design function to
manufacturing. One system, called the Apparel and Accessory Manufacturing
Pipeline (AAMP), integrates the cloth-cutting, printing and stitching
processes. The Dollars 1m package allows rapid prototyping and short
production runs.
It is a short step from CAD to using computers to reduce wastage of cloth
when it is cut into shapes ready to be stitched into garments.
Cloth-cutting has long been mechanically assisted. Traditionally, the cutter
follows lines drawn by hand on the cloth itself. UK-based clothes
manufacturer Burberry this year introduced a simple IBM PC-based software
package that allows the shapes of the cloth pieces to be fitted together
jigsaw-like to make the best use of the width of cloth available. The PC
outputs the design onto a wide carriage printer and the outlines are used as
stencils by the cutter.
The next logical stage, already in use by some clothing manufacturers, is to
link such a CAD system directly to cloth-cutting machines.
This is a technique favoured by manufacturers in Germany as part of 'outward
processing', a system of manufacture that minimises the labour content
within a high wage-cost country. After automatic cutting, cloth pieces are
shipped to lower wage cost countries for assembly into garments.
Garment-making itself is still resistant to the introduction of computers:
clothes manufacturers still find it more productive to shift production to
lower wage-cost regions than invest in the possibility of automated garment
assembly.
Nevertheless, efficiency can be improved through computer links with garment
retailers.
A typical system is an 'integrated supply chain product' made by UK company
Prologic. This software package links garment orders with information on
supply bottlenecks in, for example, the schedule of cloth delivery.
For example, if a retail chain orders a range of clothes, the salesman keys
in that information. The computer responds by providing possible supply
dates. If a higher priority is given to the new order, the software
calculates what the knock-on effect will be on other orders that need the
same cloth.
Prologic's customers include such companies as Aquascutum and Paul Smith.
Computer-literate textiles and clothing executives face a dazzling choice of
ways to introduce computer technology into their companies' manufacturing
processes. But unlike office managers, it is not a question of which
accounts or spreadsheet package to buy. Instead they need to examine their
production process and consider where, precisely, computers would make the
most difference.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (5): Where modesty is
out of place / Company profile of EDS Unigraphics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN 1989, the Indian company Bharat Forge, which makes automotive components
ranging from axle beams to steering knuckles, decided it wanted to introduce
Cadcam (computer aided design and manufacturing) software to support its die
design and manufacturing activities.
Now, having taken the plunge into Cadcam, Bharat is claiming to be among the
world's five most technically advanced commercial forge shops. It is
modelling the dies on screen and then machining them directly, using
numerical control programs generated by the Cam process. Bharat has reduced
its tooling develop- ment time from six to two months, and has improved the
speed and accuracy of its machining.
When Bharat selected its Cadcam system the range of choices available in
India was limited. But it is a nice accolade for its supplier, EDS
Unigraphics, that Bharat says it would still opt for it even though several
more Cadcam packages are now available.
Apart from being an encouraging sign of how the importance of Cadcam is
being increasingly recognised in the industrialising countries, the story is
also an illustration of EDS Unigraphics' global strength.
There is no place for modesty in the market for selling computers and
software to industry, and EDS Uni- graphics says it 'provides the most
comprehensive Cadcam/cae (computer-aided engineering) offerings available
and leads the market in the breadth of its related products and services.
The Unigraphics system is a major manufacturing tool for aerospace and
automotive industries and is used in producing a wide range of industrial
equipment and consumer goods.
Along with many Cadcam companies, it has had a chequered past, but the key
recent event came in 1991 when the EDS subsidiary of General Motors bought
McDonnell Douglas Systems Integration in the US and the Cadcam side of
McDonnell Douglas Information Systems outside the US, acquiring in the
process the Unigraphics product range.
Mr Jim Duncan, general manager for EDS Unigraphics in Europe, says EDS knew
a lot about Unigraphics because of the participation of McDonnell Douglas in
GM's C4 project, an internal engineering and design initiative. EDS had also
been successful in industries such as banking, insurance and health, but
less so in manufacturing, which was and remains the great strength of
Unigraphics.
Further reorganisation followed, and research spending has risen sharply
under the new owners. According to a recent study of the company by Mr Dave
Weisberg in Engineering Automation Report, initial fears about the merger
have proved unfounded.
One concern was that Uni- graphics would focus on the needs of GM, giving a
lower priority to other customers. In fact, says Mr Weisberg, current
product development and business activities clearly indicate that EDS
Unigraphics are quite interested in pursuing traditional Cadcam markets.
EDS has also avoided one of the big mistakes that can be made in acquiring a
high-tech company, and has not made large-scale personnel replacements or
changed the personality of the company. Mr John Mazzola is still president
and most of the key Unigraphics people are still in place.
The key strategic development since the takeover has been the repositioning
of the company to offer a much broader range of services than is the norm
for a Cadcam vendor. The aim is to satisfy customers' current need to view
product modelling via Cad as an one element of the entire business process
rather than simply a means to raise productivity in the design department.
Apart from product modelling, therefore, the company has three other closely
inter-related areas of activity. Because concurrent engineering requires
unrestricted data sharing and systems that can operate with each other, EDS
Unigraphics produces a software tool called Information Manager which
manages product and process definition data throughout the product life
cycle, and makes sure information reaches the right people at the right
time.
It also offers the EDS advanced computing and communications technology to
make the product modelling and product data management more valuable.
Finally, there is a collaborative approach to enable companies to develop
their products and processes, including expert help on process engineering
and productivity.
Overall, EDS Unigraphics rather grandly calls this its Unique Perspective on
Productivity. The aim, says Mr Duncan, is for the company to secure its
future as one of perhaps only four or five global players in the Cadcam
market.
And that means being global in a geographic sense too, while recognising the
differences between industries and countries and avoiding the dangers of
becoming over-centralised.
'So much of our business comes from multinationals,' says Mr Duncan. 'Unless
a vendor can support the customers in all the countries where it is
operating, it won't stay in the premier league of suppliers.'
Mr Duncan says EDS Unigraphics is experiencing a healthy year in a difficult
business environment. In a European market forecast to grow by 4 per cent
this year, the value of orders received in the first half of the year grew
by more than 10 per cent, compared with the same period of 1992.
'The business has benefited enormously from the new global organisation,' he
says.
But the company is happy to admit that even with the muscle of EDS, and,
ultimately, GM behind it, it cannot do everything itself. Accordingly, it
has formed several strategic partnerships with smaller companies which Mr
Duncan calls 'best in class' companies, such as ICAD with its
Knowledge-based Engineering software.
Some of these relationships are acquiring new importance this year because
of the launch by EDS Unigraphics of V10 - the 10th version of its
Unigraphics Cadcam software. This involves much more than the usual
incremental improvements found in new versions of software and is the
result, says the company, of constant probing for ways to help manufacturers
bring products to market faster, more cost-effectively and with built-in
quality.
Features include the ability to switch between different design processes,
such as wireframe, surfaces and 3D solids, and a new easy-to-use Motif-based
user interface.
V10 was launched in May, and is the most important result so far of the
increased R&amp;D spending since EDS took over. Last month, in a significant
development that was a response to the wishes of EDS Unigraphics customers,
the company said that V10 is being 'ported for,' or made to run on,
workstations made by Silicon Graphics, one of the leading 3D graphics
workstation vendors.
On the near horizon for EDS Unigraphics is the full implementation of a
concept called virtual product development, which is related to one of the
current buzz-phrases in US corporate-speak, the 'virtual' factory or
corporation. This is the trend for companies to form ever-shifting
relationships with other corporations without geographic barriers, getting a
job or part of a job done wherever it can be done best and quickest, and
cutting out the fixed cost of a heavy infrastructure.
Virtual product development is similar in that it means people from
different companies and countries will work concurrently, and even on an ad
hoc basis, to design and manufacture products.
The key to the success of such an idea is a communication network which can
distribute information about the product electronically - which is why EDS
Unigraphics believes there is so much more to Cadcam than just throwing out
the drawing tables.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (2): Monopolies
are being quickly eroded - Privatisation in Europe - Public perception often
lags behind concrete reality - and telecommunications is no exception

<TEXT>
ACROSS western Europe, the general perception is that telecommunications are
monopoly, state-run utilities. In reality, their monopolies are being fast
eroded, and governments are rapidly disengaging themselves not only from the
management, but also the ownership, of public telecommunications operators
(PTOs).
A decade ago, most of western Europe's PTOs were effectively government
departments. Their policy was determined by the state; their finances were
to all intents and purposes part of the state budget; decisions about
tariffs and investment were taken by ministers; and the PTOs were generally
grouped together with postal services to make a single state communications
utility.
No longer. With a few exceptions, PTOs have been separated from postal
services. Most PTOs have also been given corporate status, turning them into
free-standing companies with one shareholder, the state. Although their
boards are appointed by ministers, who also determine overall policy,
operational independence is the norm.
There is no intrinsic reason why corporate status should not be a settled
state. However, for most PTOs it is turning out to be a temporary staging
post to full privatisation. In many cases it was always intended to be that
way; but even where that was not the intention, pressures from overburdened
state budgets and the liberalising international telecoms market have forced
the pace.
Within a year or two, only Austria, Norway, Luxembourg and Switzerland are
likely still to have old-style state-run PTOs.
The PTOs of Belgium, Finland, France, Ireland and Sweden are corporations,
or soon will be. The first four all appear set to take further steps towards
privatisation in the near future:
Belgacom, the Belgian PTO, recently formed a 75:25 joint venture with
Pacific Telesis, the US regional operator, to operate its new GSM cellular
service. The step is widely seen as a trial run for privatisation of the
company as a whole, although a strategic alliance with another US operator
is thought to be unlikely.
Telecom Finland is about to become a corporation, and from next January
faces strong competition for voice traffic in its home market from a new
consortium of regional operators.
Telecom France did not feature in the first batch of state companies to be
privatised by the centre-right Balladur government. But it is likely to
appear on a future list.
Telecom Eireann, the Irish PTO, is engaged in talks with Cable and Wireless,
the UK group, about a possible alliance. Although the Irish government
insists that privatisation is 'not on the agenda,' few Irish observers
believe an alliance without a formal stake for the strategic partner will be
Telecom Eireann's final destination.
The rest of western Europe's PTOs are still further down the privatisation
track. With the sale of the last tranche of government shares this summer,
British Telecommunications is now entirely private owned.
OTE, the Greek state operator, appeared to be the next in the queue, under a
scheme voted through the Greek parliament earlier this summer to give a 35
per cent stake to a strategic partner with management control, with another
14 per cent to be floated on the Greek stock exchange early next year.
However, the recent return of the Greek socialists, under Mr Andreas
Papandreou, is likely to scupper the sale. The socialists are pledged to
keep OTE in the state sector, though in what form remains to be seen.
There will be at least three significant flotations in the next two years:
Deutsche Telecom, the German PTO, will be the largest. Constitutional
amendments to enable the privatisation to go ahead are about to be
introduced into the German Parliament, with a first stake in the company set
for flotation in 1996. Germany's will be an unusually complex privatisation,
partly because of the delicate legal status of Deutsche Telecom and its
employees, and partly because of the exigencies of a cross-party agreement
with the opposition Social Democrats necessary to get the required
parliamentary majority for the privatisation legislation.
KPN, the Dutch posts and telecoms operator, is to be privatised in two
stages over the next three years. The government has indicated that it
intends to retain only about 30 per cent of the shares after the second
sale.
A minority stake in Tele Danmark, the Danish Operator, will be sold early
next year. TD is already a publicly-quoted company, and earlier disposals
have reduced the state's holding to 89 per cent.
Those four are unlikely to be the only offerings on the horizon. Some of the
corporations might reach the market in the same time-span. The Turkish
government appears to have reached tentative agreement on a partial sale of
PTT Turkey. Part or all of the PTOs of Spain, Italy and Portugal are already
publicly listed companies, and a reduction in the government-owned stake is
likely in all three.
In Portugal and Italy, it will go hand-in-hand with a significant
re-organisation of the industry. The operating subsidiaries of Stet, the
Italian telecoms holding company, are to be brought together into a single
company, provisionally named Telecom Italia. The three-company Portuguese
industry is to be similarly rationalised.
No privatisation blueprint exists. Although the PTOs are engaged in a common
business, and many of them have comparable debt and investment profiles,
each PTO has its own problems and peculiarities. Nonetheless, two models are
emerging. For small PTOs, the favoured option is to sell a stake of about a
third to an established international operator, in return for management
expertise, investment and marketing resources. A further, though smaller
stake can then be floated on the domestic stock exchange, leaving the state
with a 51 per cent stake at the outset.
For larger PTOs, a conventional flotation is the most likely course. This
need not - and in most cases will not - preclude formal alliances with other
international operators.
A host of issues have to be resolved on a case-by-case basis - valuation,
regulation, reserve government powers and guarantees of employee rights
being only the most vexatious. Needless to say, consultancies and merchant
banks are salivating at the prospect.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (2): Focus switches to
integration - New products on the market reflect changes in fashion and
demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MIKE FARISH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SUPPLY of advanced design and manufacturing systems is not quite a
fashion industry. But there are distinct trends in the relative importance
attached to particular business issues and their relevant technological
'solutions'.
This reflects the mix of real demand from manufacturing industry, advances
in enabling technologies and a dash of marketing 'push' from vendor
companies.
Just a few years ago the areas of emphasis included:
linking CAD and CAM so that the shopfloor made exactly what the design
department wanted;
networking machine tools through the emerging MAP (Manufacturing Automation
Protocol) communications standard;
establishing effective standardised means of transferring CAD data between
software programs from different vendors;
porting formerly mainframe-based software systems onto networks of 'desktop'
workstations and even PCs;
slashing the price/performance ratios of hardware platforms.
None of these issues has ceased to be relevant, but their provision is
increasingly taken for granted as other topics become the focus for 'leading
edge' products.
Now the most urgent requirements are seen to include:
the complete integration of design and manufacturing data with business
functions so that the ordering, manufacturing and despatch of products are
all part of a seamless process controlled by a single database;
ensuring that such integration is based on accepted OSI (Open Systems
Interconnection) standards rather than proprietary links, enabling users to
mix and match software systems according to requirements;
providing software systems that can support new forms of organisation and
procedures, such as cellular and Just-in-Time (JIT) manufacturing.
Products that attempt to achieve company-wide integration of business and
technical information are known generically as Enterprise Resource Planning
(ERP) systems, or sometimes as Customer Oriented Manufacturing Management
Systems (COMMS).
They exploit a range of up-to-date computer technologies such as graphical
user interfaces, fourth generation languages (4GLs), relational databases
and client/server hardware configurations.
They aim to allow access to commercial and technical data generated by
multi-site, multinational, functionally-diverse manufacturing operations and
to facilitate effective control of key issues such as supply chain
management.
Such products have started to come onto the market only within the last year
or so, but are represented at CIM '93. One example is the JIT Enterprise
software package already used by some 50 companies in the US and now being
introduced to the European market by Fourth Shift UK.
The product incorporates the Oracle relational database and has over 50
integrated application modules. The software is explicitly described as an
ERP product and is intended to support 'lean,' JIT-type manufacturing
procedures.
Another ERP product is the Control Manufacturing system from Cincom, first
launched in March this year. The company is bringing to CIM '93 a new
version of the product, Control Manufacturing 7.3, which it describes as a
significant step towards its aim of 'full Open Systems implementation in
1994'.
One of the capabilities ERP offers is multi-language input and Cincom says
options already available are English, French, German, Swedish, Italian,
Spanish, kanji and Portuguese. With an eye to the emerging eastern European
market Czech is under development.
The Manman/X system from ASK Computer Systems is a similar product that now
boasts over 130 user sites worldwide since its launch just over a year ago.
A new version, Release 2.1, to be introduced at the show, demonstrates ERP's
ability to cope with local demands through an option that can cope with
Canadian tax laws.
Ultimately, ERP is expected to sound the death-knell of the well-established
MRPII (Manufacturing Resource Planning) systems currently used to integrate
business and technical data.
But MRPII is likely to be around for some time yet, though there are signs
that systems are evolving towards the ERP model. The new Impcon 2000 MRPII
system being introduced by AT&amp;T Istel, for instance, claims to combine a
'4GL user interface with proven 3GL MRPII functionality'.
Elsewhere, several other products emphasise the drive towards integration,
though in more specialised applications. Cimtel is introducing CIM-Trak to
'close the loop' between its existing engineering data management and
process planning packages through production, operator and quality
performance monitoring.
Cimlinc will be demonstrating how its Linkage networking product can help
integrate diverse application packages from different vendors. At CIM '93 it
will be implementing a network in which data will be ported between CAD
software from UK vendor Radan Computational and the Supercapes process
planning package marketed by PS Industry.
On the hardware front Silicon Graphics will be demonstrating its recently
introduced range of low-cost workstations, whose prices start at less than
Pounds 5,000. But besides being able to run technical packages, such as the
AutoCAD design software, the machines also have substantial digital media
capabilities enabling them to be used for transmitting video images.
One word starting to crop up more frequently in the engineering software
area is Windows, the highly versatile PC operating system that permits easy
manipulation of on-screen graphics developed by Microsoft. It provides an
obvious migration path from the simpler DOS operating system - as well as
from Microsoft - that has already effectively monopolised the industrial PC
market.
Several companies are showing Windows products. Production Modeling
Corporation of Europe will be introducing ProModel for Windows, an upgrade
to its DOS-based ProModel manufacturing simulation system.
The company says the change greatly enhances ease of use and the variety of
graphical output available. DesignCAD for Windows from PMS (Instruments) is
a similar upgrade to the company's existing 2D DesignCAD for DOS product.
One consequence of the change is much more potential for customisation of
the system by users. But in the background there are also the beginnings of
a confrontation between the Unix operating system within which most
workstation-based software systems currently run and Microsoft's recently
launched Windows NT product, even more powerful than basic Windows.
'High-end' PCs running Windows NT provide comparable performance to
'low-end' Unix workstations. One of the first products to exploit the
situation is the Pro/Engineer parametric modelling system from Parametric
Technology. The company will be showing Pro/Engineer running on a Compaq
Deskpro '486' PC.
The establishment of Windows/Windows NT products in the engineering software
field is likely to prove one of the fundamental driving forces for product
development over the next few years.
