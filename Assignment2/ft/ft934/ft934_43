FT  16 OCT 93 / London heads EC fares league
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LONDON COMMUTERS pay the highest fares of any capital city in the European
Community, a survey by the Association of London Authorities revealed
yesterday.
Calculated on 10 six-mile (10km) trips, Londoners pay Pounds 15.65 per week.
Brussels was the second most expensive city at Pounds 12.95, having moved up
from last year's sixth place. Athens remains the cheapest at Pounds 2.12.
Ms Jane Reeves, of the association, said: 'European visitors are astonished
at the cost of public transport in London. Our commuters pay by far the
highest fares in Europe and the government's policy of above-inflation
increases each year means that Londoners will continue to pay the most.'
London Transport accepted the association's findings. It said London fares
were so high because of government policy of meeting most transport costs
from fares, rather than general taxation.
It said: 'London's transport services are by no means the most expensive in
Europe. However, we work on a subsidy of less than 10 per cent of running
costs. In other cities, subsidies can be as high as 70 per cent or 80 per
cent.'
It added that Stockholm, outside the EC, was the only European capital where
transport fares rivalled London's.
The placings, with last year's positions in brackets, are:
 --------------------------------------------------
 1  (1) London                Pounds 15.65

FT  16 OCT 93 / Locals 'resentful' of Sellafield plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ACCEPTANCE by people living near Sellafield of the Cumbrian nuclear
plant is based more on its role in the local economy than on a good
understanding of nuclear power, an independent report says.
The report, by Lancaster University's Centre for the Study of Environmental
Change and the consultants Environmental Resources Management, says there is
considerable local resentment at the perceived withholding of information
about leaks and other pollution incidents at Sellafield.
The report is one of a series commissioned by Cumbria County Council as
background studies on the underground nuclear waste repository that Nirex,
the nuclear industry's waste disposal company, proposes to construct at
Sellafield.
The nuclear industry tends, it says, to continually undermine its
credibility with local people by insisting on giving an impression of
comprehensive certainty and control.
British Nuclear Fuels rejected the report's comments on public and company
attitudes. It said: 'We do make mistakes and we admit those mistakes openly;
it's a warts and all operation.'

FT  16 OCT 93 / Shephard's pastoral vision: Alison Maitland and Deborah
Hargreaves interview the agriculture secretary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND and DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FARMERS need to improve their image and convince the public that they are
doing something in return for more than Pounds 1bn in aid they receive each
year, according to Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister.
Mrs Shephard, who meets her European Community counterparts in Luxembourg on
Monday, wants action to curb EC spending on agriculture combined with
greater emphasis on the environment.
She said a 'greener' Common Agricultural Policy made sense to the public so
it was 'a much bigger question than just fiddling about with the
regulations'. This would mean allowing whole farms to be taken out of
production under controversial set-aside rules and turning over land for
woodland.
Britain was pushing hard for further reform of the CAP and reductions in the
'ludicrous' levels of EC beef stocks. In her 4 1/2 months in the job, Mrs
Shephard has been working to force further CAP reform.
Mrs Shephard, the daughter of a Norfolk smallholder, relishes the 'hands-on'
aspects of her brief. But there has been some disappointment that she has
failed yet to tackle some pressing matters.
Mr David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union, stresses that
'there are a number of decisions which now require urgent attention'. Some
critics suggest Mrs Shephard may be ducking difficult issues. Some of these,
such as the future of set-aside schemes and the eventual objectives of a
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade settlement, require intense
negotiation at EC or international level.
But Mrs Shephard must also resolve some important UK matters. She must
decide whether to abolish the Agricultural Wages Board, the statutory
minimum pay body for farm workers, in the face of opposition from employers
and farm workers alike. She must also rule on the dispute over restrictions
on the number of days fishermen can spend at sea and preside over milk
market de-regulation.
Farmers have argued that the diffuse nature of the industry makes the
Agricultural Wages Board more important than other wages boards abolished by
Mrs Shephard when she employment secretary. But she is not convinced.
However, she hinted that concessions might be made on the fishing dispute.
At the moment, the rules on days at sea, due to come into force in January,
will affect all UK fishermen with trawlers more than 10 metres long. But she
suggested the limits might be applied more selectively.
In addition, she is keen to see British farmers tailor production more
closely to the needs of consumers.
Mrs Shephard is keen to erode the UK's Pounds 6bn food trade deficit, but
has been criticised by the industry for not making money available to
encourage consumers to buy British.
Mrs Shephard said the government was looking at helping producers with
strategy and market planning rather than giving more cash help.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has traditionally had a
close relationship with farmers. Mrs Shephard takes a broad view of its role
as encompassing the whole of the rural economy.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Contracting-out body says law is discouraging bidders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTRACTING OUT and market-testing of public services are in 'terminal
decline', according to the trade association representing government
contractors.
Mr John Hall, director-general of the Business Services Association, said
yesterday that regulations protecting the rights of staff whose work was
contracted out were forcing many contractors to withdraw from bidding for
public-sector work.
He predicted that contracting out would 'wither on the vine' unless the
legal uncertainties were reduced. The 25 per cent savings sought by
ministers would not materialise unless contractors were free to reorganise
work with fewer staff.
Mr Hall told a conference on contracting-out in the public sector at the
Confederation of British Industry that the ability of contractors to improve
the efficiency of public services was being blocked by the Transfer of
Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations 1981.
Where the regulations apply, the contractor is required to take over the
staff currently doing the work on existing terms and conditions. While the
regulations did not apply in every case, the uncertainty was deterring
contractors from bidding, Mr Hall said.
He added: 'I don't believe that any of us could have envisaged the
difficulty which has been created by the incursion of Tupe into
public-sector tendering.'
Speaking at the same conference, Mr Tony Baldry, environment minister, said
that the government wanted to amend the European Community legislation. He
said: 'We are discussing our proposals with other member states and are
finding increasingly that other colleagues in Europe are taking a similar
view to ours.'
Mr Hall welcomed the government's efforts to amend the EC legislation. But
he said that much more could be done to keep contracting-out alive while
Tupe continued.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Advisers warm to Lloyd's trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING independent financial advisers, who guide the portfolios of wealthy
investors, seem to be taking a positive attitude towards the new investment
trusts being formed to provide corporate capital for Lloyd's.
The insurance market is hoping that its Names - the individuals whose assets
support the market - will want to invite corporate members to join the
market next week at an extraordinary meeting.
Merchant banks and Lloyd's agents have already issued pathfinder propectuses
in preparation for flotation of four new investment trusts, all of which
would seek backing from individual as well as institutional investors.
At least 12 other similar schemes are at an advanced stage. Lloyd's is
expecting between Pounds 500m and Pounds 1bn in corporate capital to join
the market next year.
Financial advisers, who will help market these schemes to individuals, have
mixed views but some have already decided to recommend that their clients
buy shares in the trusts.
'We all think it is very exciting,' said Mr Mark Bolland, an adviser with
Chamberlain de Broe, a London-based adviser that offers a fee-based service
for the better-off.
He added: 'To be able to go into these markets with a complete floor on
losses may well be attractive.'
Mr Clive Scott-Hopkins of Towry Law, one of the country's biggests advisers,
is another enthusiast. 'One should recognise that the market is on the
recovery and rates are moving up very considerably,' said Mr Scott-Hopkins.
'It ought to do well over the next two to three years.'
Individuals with Pounds 1,000 to invest should be able to buy shares in the
trusts, while wealthier investors can make a minimum Pounds 20,000
investment in those parts of the trusts that are placed privately.
Investors in the new schemes - like Lloyd's Names - will earn a return both
from investment and from underwriting profits. Money raised by the trusts
will be invested in a range of gilts and equities but will also be used to
support underwriting by Lloyd's syndicates. For every Pounds 1 in corporate
capital backing, syndicates can underwrite Pounds 2 in premium income.
However, unlike Lloyd's Names, the new investment trusts will have limited
liability for losses. If underwriting syndicates crash, as many have done
over the past five years, investors will simply lose the amount of capital
they have committed. Lloyd's Names have unlimited liability for losses and
can theoretically be pursued by creditors for their entire personal wealth.
Mr Scott-Hopkins said the new schemes were the 'best of both worlds. You
have limited liability and very considerable gearing'.
'The worst that could happen is that you could lose your Pounds 10,000. In
practical terms that is not likely now that Lloyd's has put its house in
order,' he added.
Other financial advisers have doubts. Mr Jeremy Evans of Chantrey Vellacott
said his company was taking a 'wait and see attitude. To a great extent it
very much depends what happens over the next 12 months. I'm not totally
convinced it will be as profitable as everyone says.'
Mr Stephen Lansdown of Hargreaves Lansdown says his firm cannot decide
whether to recommend the plans. 'We may be obliged to take these to our
clients. But I am suspicious. They are complicated vehicles. Emerging
markets are a dream compared to these. I can talk about Chile and Argentina
until the cows come home. But Lloyd's underwriters . . . ?'
Some advisers remain firmly opposed. 'I can see no evidence that their
losses are going to end,' said Mr Robert Boyton, of Boyton Financial
Services. 'There is no track record on which I can make a recommendation to
my clients. I'm very much a contrarian but what concerns me with them is
that they have not reached the bottom of the cycle.'

FT  16 OCT 93 / MAI bids to revive Channel 5 scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD HOLLICK, chairman of MAI, the television, advertising and financial
services group, has joined those trying to revive the idea of a national
Channel 5.
Lord Hollick has sent a formal expression of interest to the Independent
Television Commission arguing that the original Channel 5 concept should be
re-advertised.
Last December the ITC rejected the only bid to operate the channel from a
consortium led by Thames Television, mainly on the grounds of inadequate
shareholder commitment. Later the commission set out three options for the
future of Channel 5:
A re-advertisement of the original concept - a channel which could reach
about three-quarters of the UK population.
Using the frequencies for a more locally based form of city television, an
option that would require legislation.
Using the Channel 5 frequencies to help plan a transition to digital
television.
Lord Hollick said yesterday the first option would offer an attractive
alternative service at no extra cost to the viewer.
One reason why MAI is particularly interested is that most of its Meridian
ITV franchise in the south of England would not be able to receive the
Channel 5 signal.
Thames Television, which like the Financial Times is a wholly owned
subsidiary of Pearson, has also submitted a letter of interest in a re-
advertised national channel. Thames is still having talks with media company
Time Warner and the Atlanta-based newspaper and television group Cox about
the possibility of bidding for the franchise.

NEARLY 2,500 former Leyland Daf van and truck workers dismissed when the
company went into receivership will have to wait for an industrial tribunal
ruling on compensation.
The workers, from the Leyland and Chorley plants in Lancashire, the van
plant in Birmingham and Glasgow's Albion works, say they were dismissed
without the proper consultation period.
The tribunal in Manchester was told yesterday that the company accepted that
the 90-day period had not been entered into - but that the redundancies were
forced on them because of excess capacity at the plants.
The tribunal reserved judgment. Its ruling will be given in writing to the
four unions involved.

THE High Court action brought by the administrators of Polly Peck to recover
Pounds 75m of missing funds from Citibank could be halted and transferred to
courts in Switzerland after a dispute over jurisdiction.
Touche Ross, the PPI administrators, claim that Citibank's Swiss subsidiary
is liable for Pounds 75m of the money allegedly transferred by Mr Asil
Nadir, former Polly Peck chairman, from Citibank London to its Zurich
operation and then used for his personal purposes.
Mr Justice Vinelott, the trial judge, has decided to adjourn the case until
the Swiss authorities decide if it is within their jurisdiction.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Industry shops around for power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCREASING NUMBERS of companies are buying their electricity from a supplier
other than their local power company, says a survey by Offer, the industry
regulator, Michael Smith writes.
More than half of the electricity in the competitive market is sold by
electricity suppliers to customers outside the area where they have a
distribution monopoly.
Since electricity privatisation three years ago the 5,000 electricity
consumers in England and Wales using more than 1MW have been able to shop
around for their supplies.
About a third of them are doing so, according to the Offer survey. PowerGen,
the generator, and regional electricity companies operating outside their
area, have increased their market share while that of National Power, the
other large generator, has declined.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Banham throws council review into confusion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ATTACK by Sir John Banham, chairman of the Local Government Commission,
on a policy change by Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, has thrown
the local authority review into confusion.
Last month Mr Gummer said two-tier authorities should be replaced by
all-purpose unitary authorities, even if they cost more. He said counties
that kept the existing two-tier local authority structure should be an
exception.
Sir John said yesterday: 'I think it's absolutely astonishing that a
government which claims it's under huge pressure to contain public spending
is willing to put its name to the proposition that the extent of
administrative overhead costs in shire England is of absolutely no concern.'
The commission, charged with redrawing the map of local government in
England, was appointed by the Department of the Environment.
Sir John's move follows a letter by Mr Howard Davies, director-general of
the Confederation of British Industry, to Mr Gummer describing the
department's new policy as 'an exercise in bureaucratic job creation across
the country'.
The department replied that the latest guidance asked the commission to find
proposals that were 'worthwhile and cost-effective over time'.
The government's desire for unitary authorities could also create conflict
with Sir John. Polls conducted for the commission and published earlier this
week found that an overall majority of people in County Durham favoured
retaining the status quo.
The Association of County Councils endorsed 'every word' of Sir John's
comments. Ms Tina Day, of the association, said: 'This vindicates the idea
of setting up an independent commission.'
But the Association of District Councils supported the government's new
policy. It said: 'The commission have appeared to treat cost as the sole
determinant rather than one of the factors which should be taken into
account.' The standard spending assessments used by the government to
distribute grants to local authorities were attacked in a report published
yesterday by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.
The report finds there is no such thing as an objectively 'fair' spending
assessment, and that the level of overspending by English local authorities
in relation to their assessments is almost unchanged from the overspend when
the system was introduced in 1985-86.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Lloyd's Names threaten to adjourn crucial meeting
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS OF loss-making Lloyd's Names are threatening to adjourn a crucial
meeting on Wednesday in order to press the market's council - or governing
body - to settle legal disputes at the insurance market.
Leaders of the loss-makers have been collecting proxy votes from their
members, who are among 31,607 Names eligible to vote at a meeting called by
Lloyd's to approve the introduction of corporate capital.
They believe they may be able to defeat the reform at Wednesday's
extraordinary meeting. But they fear that voting down the corporate capital
proposals would throw the market into chaos, end hopes of attracting new
investment and destroy the chances of an out-of-court settlement.
It is understood that the adjournment proposal, which is advocated by at
least two of the 37 Lloyd's Names action groups' leaders, will be discussed
at a meeting on Monday of the Lloyd's Names Associations Working Party,
which represents the action groups.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Diplomatic high-flyer may face backbench flak: The task
facing Christopher Meyer, the man just appointed to be John Major's press
secretary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CHRISTOPHER MEYER, the diplomatic high-flyer who takes over in January as
the prime minister's press secretary, is widely described as a clever man.
He will need to be.
The position of Mr John Major's government could be worse, but not much. The
latest ICM opinion poll, in The Guardian newspaper, puts Conservative
support at 31 per cent, compared with 46 per cent for the Labour party. Mr
Major's personal rating is 23 per cent - just ahead of Mr Paddy Ashdown, the
Liberal Democrat leader, but well behind Mr John Smith, Labour's leader.
Mr Meyer, 49, will not be expected single-handedly to revive the
government's popularity. That is the job of the prime minister, the cabinet
and Conservative Central Office, the party headquarters.
The press secretary's job is more subtle. He relays the prime minister's
views to political journalists, usually by means of unattributable
briefings. He rarely speaks on the record and never gives television
interviews.
But his contacts with journalists help set the tone of media coverage, and
he influences the government's overall communications strategy through a
weekly meeting of departmental press secretaries, which he chairs.
The two roles make him a powerful, if shadowy, figure. They also make him a
target for criticism if things go wrong.
Mr Gus O'Donnell, the affable economist who has done the job since Mr Major
moved into 10 Downing Street in 1990, shares with the prime minister a south
London background and a love of sport. He is liked by political journalists,
who respect his honesty and his refusal to cross the line which separates
the assiduous civil servant from the party hack.
Yet Mr O'Donnell, 41, has been the target of a whispering campaign among
backbench Tory MPs, mostly disaffected rightwingers, who blame him for the
government's apparent inability to get its message across. Even loyal
backbenchers have called for changes to improve presentation of government
policies.
Mr O'Donnell has not been forced out. He is leaving voluntarily for a senior
Treasury post advising on monetary policy. But the prime minister has taken
the opportunity to beef up his media presentation.
Mr Meyer, a Cambridge history graduate, is Britain's deputy ambassador in
Washington, where he and Sir Robin Renwick, the ambassador, are regarded as
the most influential British diplomatic team for years. Mr Meyer is thought
to have been in line for promotion to ambassador before deciding to accept
the job at Number 10.
He made his name as head of the Foreign Office news department from 1984 to
1989, when he acquired a glowing reputation as a tough and intelligent aide
to the then foreign secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe, now Lord Howe.
He is best remembered for a coup at the 1987 Commonwealth summit in
Vancouver, when Lord Howe and Mrs Margaret (now Baroness) Thatcher, then
prime minister, were under pressure from Canada to reduce British trade with
South Africa. Britain appeared likely to suffer a serious diplomatic defeat
until Mr Meyer discovered some little known figures demonstrating that
Canada was also trading with South Africa on a much greater scale than had
been realised.
Sir Bernard Ingham, then Lady Thatcher's press secretary, describes him as
intelligent and clear-minded, with enough political nous to restrict himself
to representing the prime minister, rather than falling into the trap of
charting his own course.
But the best political antennae in the world will not protect him from the
wrath of Tory backbenchers if things continue to go badly for the
government. 'My experience is that MPs panic every five minutes,' says Sir
Bernard. 'When the government goes wrong they always blame the presentation.
They tried to force me to quit regularly.'

FT  16 OCT 93 / Customs plans Euro blitz on VAT fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUSTOMS and Excise plans to station officers in other European Community
countries as part of an EC-wide clamp down on value added tax fraud. The
move follows the abolition of border controls at the beginning of this year.
The 'attaches', based in British embassies, will carry out co-ordination and
investigation work to prevent inter-EC VAT fraud. The plan is modelled on a
successful customs network to uncover drug smuggling around the world.
Customs is now seeking final approval to place attaches in Brussels, Paris
and the Hague. If the initiative is successful, there may be postings in
other member states.
The plan has come to light at a time when the European Commission is working
to strengthen co-ordination between national tax authorities in response to
the changes caused by the single European market. The removal of border
controls on January 1 means customs officers now depend on those who trade
within the EC filing accurate monthly or quarterly VAT returns. They no
longer collect documents on goods at EC borders.
The EC recently introduced a system called the VAT Information Exchange
System to trace trade across boundaries, and another called the Customs
Intelligence System which relays anti-fraud messages between 170 computer
terminals in the national customs services.
It plans to introduce a further version by next summer. It also plans to
launch its Matthaeus programme in 1995 to second about 100 EC tax
investigators annually to other countries for two or three weeks each.
Customs said it was too early to tell whether fraud had risen as a result of
the single market. Attempts to gauge its impact have been complicated by
companies' difficulties in complying with the new rules, some of which are
yet to be finalised.
But in the first three months of the new regime, Customs had brought its
largest ever VAT fraud case to court. In March Operation Erie 2 had
culminated in Customs charging 11 British nationals with a Pounds 10m VAT
fraud on gold transported from Luxembourg to the UK.
Mrs Christiane Scrivener, the commissioner responsible for EC tax policy, is
expected to announce at the next Ecofin meeting for economic and finance
ministers that there is little evidence so far of substantial fraud since
the start of the single market.
Her estimate is based on the fact that preliminary figures from member
states show little difference between total VAT collection levels between
this year and last.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Pirate BSkyB cards get all-clear for radio adverts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SATELLITE Decoder Systems, the company selling unauthorised decoders for Sky
Television subscription channels has booked a month-long advertising
campaign on commercial radio.
The campaign follows advice from Mr Geoff Holland, Cheshire's principal
trading standards officer, that it does not appear to be illegal to
advertise unauthorised decoders in the UK.
Broadcasting legislation makes it a criminal offence to manufacture, hire,
distribute or use the pirate decoders - but not apparently to advertise. Mr
David Lyons of Satellite Decoder Systems said yesterday he intended to
advertise his card, which unlocks all the Sky subscription channels, and
continue to send out information sheets.
All mail received would be sent unopened to his office in the Irish hamlet
of Ballyegan in Co Offaly, and cards would be posted from Ireland.
There is no specific law in Ireland, or in most European Community
countries, outlawing pirate television decoders.
Mr Lyons has paid for four 30-second advertising slots a day for a month on
Marcher Coast FM and Marcher Gold - commercial radio services covering the
North Wales coast and Wrexham and Deeside.
Ms Sue Whittle, head of sales at the broadcaster, said yesterday the
stations had been assured by trading standards authorities that it would not
be illegal to advertise such a product.
But she emphasised that she would not clear the advertisements until she had
heard what they said.
If the Marcher stations do broadcast the advertisements it could open the
way for more extensive advertising of the unauthorised cards which seem to
be coming to Ireland from Germany.
Pearson, owner of the FT, has a significant stake in British Sky
Broadcasting, the company that operates Sky.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Chance to put a name in lights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN OPPORTUNITY to advertise in lights at London's landmark Piccadilly Circus
will arise next year. The Pounds 1m-a-year neon slot will be vacant as a
result of a decision by Panasonic, the Japanese consumer electronic company,
not to renew its lease on the site.
Land Securities, the property company, is offering the slot on a five-year
lease from next June. The new sign will 'have to be compatible' with other
advertisers, which include Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Foster's and Sanyo, said
the company. 'For example, Pepsi would probably not be on,' it explained.
In the course of a year about 24m vehicles, 100m bus passengers and 32m
underground passengers use Piccadilly Circus, said Land Securities.
The 1,600 sq ft site currently takes 7,620 ft of neon tubes, 29,000 ft of
cables and has 25 computers controlling 15,000 electrical switches.
Panasonic said yesterday that after 10 years of having its name in lights at
Piccadilly Circus 'other opportunities had become available'.
It is 20 years since a British-owned company advertised at the famous site,
although past names have included BP, British Airways, Schweppes and Players
Cigarettes.
Coca-Cola has displayed its illuminated sign since 1968.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Hurd seeks to heal rift on Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DOUGLAS HURD, the foreign secretary, yesterday sought to bridge
government divisions over next year's European parliament elections by
distancing the Conservative party from its federalist allies.
Speaking to Conservative activists in the Cornwall European constituency, Mr
Hurd said the party would campaign hard in the June elections to defeat the
parliament's socialist majority.
But he said the manifesto would not endorse the federalist platform of the
European People's Party group, to which the Conservative parliamentary group
belongs.
'We urgently need to restore a centre-right majority in the parliament, with
more Conservative MEPs working with - but not subordinate to - our allies in
the EPP,' he said.
'The European Parliament is too important to be hijacked by yesterday's men
with tired ideas. Our candidates will fight on a Conservative manifesto
which we have begun to prepare.'
The party's link with the EPP has angered rightwing Euro-sceptics, prompting
some to decline to canvass for candidates suspected of being 'soft' on
federalism.
Conservative leaders are keenly aware that continuing divisions on Europe
could lead to an embarrassing defeat.
The Tories lost a third of their European seats in the 1989 election, when
they emerged with 32 of the 78 British mainland seats, compared with 45 won
by Labour.
According to confidential research by Conservative Central Office, up to a
quarter of party seats are threatened, mostly by Liberal Democrats.

<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton was reported to be 'delighted' with the Senate vote
in the small hours of yesterday morning supporting his policies in Somalia,
Jurek Martin reports from Washington.
The Senate vote, 76-23, backed funding for US military involvement until
March 31, the withdrawal deadline set by the president last week. On
Thursday Senator Robert Byrd, the West Virginia Democrat, had withdrawn an
amendment requiring an earlier withdrawal.
The Senate also defeated, by 61-38, a motion advanced by Senator John
McCain, the Republican from Arizona, that would have confined funding only
to the withdrawal of US troops.
The divisions were not on party lines. Senator Bill Bradley from New Jersey,
the progressive Democrat, was as adamantly opposed to US engagement in
Somalia as Senator McCain, who is very conservative.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Malawi gets ready for life without Banda: The background to
reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF Africa's most extraordinary political careers came in effect to an
unheralded end this week.
Without fanfare, and in accordance with the constitution, executive power
passed from the hands of Malawi's President Hastings Kamuzu Banda to a
triumvirate drawn from the ranks of the ruling Malawi Congress party.
Dr Banda, who has presided over the country's fortunes since independence in
1964, is convalescing after brain surgery in a South African clinic, and
unlikely to make a political comeback. But the reforms he reluctantly set in
train now have a momentum of their own.
The country's transition from one-party rule to multi-party democracy, which
began last June when a substantial majority voted in a referendum to end
single-party rule, looks set to end in a general election next May.
Campaigning has yet to get formally under way, but the ruling party could
well retain office through a combination of shrewd tactics and a divided
opposition.
The former is illustrated by the party's choice for chairman of the
triumvirate: Mr Gwanda Chakuamba, a former cabinet minister, who came out of
prison in July after serving 13 years' hard labour for sedition. That he
should now be willing to lead the party which locked him up, followed by a
brief spell with the opposition United Democratic Front, may be seen as
opportunistic or pragmatic. It certainly took the opposition by surprise.
A party stalwart, Mr John Tembo, is also in the new triumvirate, the closest
minister to Mr Banda in recent years and long tipped as his successor. But
Mr Tembo appears to have moved with the times.
Few now think he will try to roll back the democratisation process that has
been urged on Malawi by the international community. The government has so
far honoured its pledge to work with opposition parties, represented on a
National Consultative Council on which they hold a majority, towards general
elections.
The current issue for the Congress party is not how to prevent political
pluralism but how to survive within it; and the indications are that the
party may yet have a political future despite a distinctly mixed past, with
a moderate to good record on economic management and a very poor one on
human rights.
Impoverished at independence, the country remains poor, with a per capita
GNP of Dollars 160 (Pounds 106), among the lowest in the world, reflected in
bad health and social indicators.
However, none of the economic challenges ahead have been seriously addressed
by Malawi's new and vociferous political classes, partly because they
recognise the constraints that will limit the policy choices of whoever is
in power.
Thus a round of strikes last month in pursuit of pay claims, many in excess
of 100 per cent, passed almost without comment from Mr Chakufwa Chihana,
leader of the Alliance for Democracy (Aford), or Mr Bakili Muluzi of the
rival United Democratic Front.
There is, it seems, a tacit agreement with the government that the country
cannot afford the inflationary pressure of wage settlements.
Instead, the main opposition groups prefer to keep attention focused on
their rival claims to be the most effective guarantors of human rights and
democracy.
Aford perhaps has the moral edge in the display of democratic credentials.
Mr Chihana has a trade union background and has thrice been imprisoned by
the Banda regime, whereas Mr Muluzi is a former cabinet minister and
secretary general of the Congress party.
UDF, however, has more evident support in the business community, more funds
and better organisation, and is better able to present itself as a serious
contender for government.
Both parties accept the broad terms of structural adjustment in progress in
Malawi since the late 1980s and are resigned to funding any new social or
productive programmes from rationalisation of existing government
expenditure.
Two much smaller opposition parties, the Malawi Democratic party and the
United Front for Multiparty Democracy, are hoping to pick up refugees from
the larger groups.
With little of substance yet to distinguish the main opposition contenders,
the clearest difference for most Malawians is their regional affiliation.
Aford's support lies predominantly in the north, UDF's in the south. Mr
Chihana and Mr Muluzi both aspire to address the whole country, but the
vaguer they are about what they stand for, the greater the perception of
regionalism becomes.
If this trend is consolidated, the Malawi Congress party may yet retain
support in the central region, with which it is primarily identified, or
even manage to project itself as the most truly national of the contenders
for power in the elections scheduled for May.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Softer Patten line lifts HK share index
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HONG KONG Governor Chris Patten's change of tactics in agreeing to discuss
separately some minor elements of his political reform proposals were
interpreted by investors yesterday as a political breakthrough. The stock
market rose to its highest ever, on record turnover.
In his statements, however, Mr Patten was adamant that a separate agreement
over some 'straightforward' issues would not affect the timetable for his
more contentious proposals on the 1995 elections of the Legislative Council,
Hong Kong's law-making body.
He said: 'It is the Legislative Council elections which impose the real time
pressures and, to that extent, argument about the district boards is
slightly irrelevant.'
Some media commentators said Mr Patten's comments represented a concession
to China, which has pushed for separate discussions over district board and
municipal elections from those for Legco.
The district elections are to be held in 1994, and, by focusing on these,
the Chinese would hope to buy time on the blueprint for the subsequent Legco
elections, which it strongly opposes.
These suggestions of a conciliatory move provided further fuel for the
colony's red-hot stock market, and the Hang Seng Index rose 351 points, or 4
per cent, to 8,764. The index has risen almost 1,100 points since the start
of October.
Many analysts believe Mr Patten's move will at least enable British and
Chinese negotiators to resume a dialogue in the next round of talks on
October 20, following several meetings which have yielded little more than
recriminations over lack of progress.
By moving from his stated position that 'the proposals need to be considered
as a package', he has made a concession which could facilitate an agreement
on several minor issues, such as the reduction of the voting age from 21 to
18. But there is still no evidence China is prepared to alter its position
on the more important elements of his proposals.
Mr Patten will meet the British cabinet on November 10th to discuss whether
to proceed with the negotiations with China, or to table the proposals
before Legco.

OZONE levels over the Antarctic have fallen to record lows in the past few
weeks and for the second year running the ozone hole has extended to
populated areas of South America, the World Meteorological Organisation said
yesterday. The latest data show no halt to the trend that has seen the
seasonal ozone hole steadily deepen and widen since its first appearance in
the late 1970s.
The United Nations agency said that, for three weeks in late September and
early October, the ozone hole encircled the entire continent, with more than
60 per cent of the ozone destroyed over an area greater than all of Europe.
For two days at the end of September, ozone levels over the southern tip of
South America were 40 per cent below pre-ozone hole averages and over the
Antarctic ozone measurements on several days were the lowest on record.
Loss of ozone in the upper atmosphere, which acts as a natural filter
against harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun, causes sunburn, skin cancer
and cataracts and threatens plant and marine life.
Under the Montreal Protocol industrialised countries will prohibit
production of chlorofluorocarbons and other ozone-eating chemicals from
1995, but their concentration in the atmosphere may not fall until early
next century.
The US and the European Community are expected to be among some 60 countries
ratifying the international treaty on biological diversity by the end of
this year, according to Mr Vicente Sanchez, chairman of the
intergovernmental committee negotiating details of its implementation. The
treaty, which has received 31 ratifications so far, is due to come into
force on December 29.
However, a week-long meeting of the committee in Geneva involving some 129
nations ended yesterday with little progress on such key issues as funding
arrangements, intellectual property rights and the sharing of benefits from
use of genetic resources.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Japanese recovery trend 'marking time'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S official forecasting body yesterday slightly downgraded its view on
the economy, as the latest figures from the retail industry underlined
consumers' continuing gloom.
'Movement towards a recovery is marking time and (the economy) is largely
stagnating, affected by the sharp rise in the yen and the cool, wet summer,'
the Economic Planning Agency said. This contrasts with the agency's previous
monthly report, which said that the economy was at a 'standstill' but that
the agency was sticking to its view that the recession would get not worse.
To back up the agency's gloomy assessment, Mr Yasuhi Mieno, governor of the
Bank of Japan, warned yesterday that business sentiment had turned more
cautious and that he saw no clear signs of recovery. Banks had become
slightly more positive about making new loans, but were still cautious,
because of bad debts built up during the liquidity-fed rise in asset prices
of the late 1980s, Mr Mieno said.
The agency highlighted three factors in Japan's current economic weakness: a
continued fall in consumer spending, the rise in inventories of unsold
stocks, and the decline in job openings. Department store sales in Tokyo
fell an annualised 10.2 per cent last month, the 19th monthly decline in a
row, the Japan department stores association said yesterday.
A small, but unreliable, indicator of an improvement came with a report
yesterday of a steep decline in corporate bankruptcies in the first half of
the fiscal year, the six months to September. The amount of bankruptcies
fell by 18.3 per cent in the first half, the third six-monthly fall running,
said Teikoku Data Bank, a private research group.
However, the decline in corporate collapses could be merely a symptom of the
sluggishness of business activity, warned Mr James Vestal, chief economist
at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo.
Separately, Teikoku reported that liabilities guaranteed by Japan's 82
listed construction companies for their property subsidiaries rose by 15.5
per cent in 1992, to Y3,335bn (Pounds 20.5bn) - a heavy burden on their
balance sheets.

FT  16 OCT 93 / US deal with Aideed raises warlord's power: The aftermath of
an airman's release
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITHIN a few days Gen Mohammed Farah Aideed has been transformed from a
villain into a key participant in the future of Somalia, but on what terms
remains unclear.
The tea-stalls on the dusty streets of Mogadishu were buzzing with
speculation yesterday over what Gen Aideed might have extracted from the US
in return for Thursday's release of a captured US pilot.
Despite Washington's insistence that the hostage was freed
'unconditionally', Gen Aideed appears to have benefitted in one immediate
respect: the United Nations' hunt for the rebel warlord has been called off.
Instead of seeking to place him on trial for the slaying of 24 Pakistani
peacekeepers in June, the UN will allow an independent commission to
investigate the incident.
It is unlikely it will find Gen Aideed solely responsible for the escalation
of violence in Mogadishu. UN forces also killed hundreds of Somalis in its
failed attempts to capture the fugitive general.
It is also expected the UN will shortly free some of Gen Aideed's militiamen
and political supporters. Mr Robert Oakley, President Bill Clinton's special
envoy sent to deal with the hostage crisis in Somalia, is said to have given
Gen Aideed his personal pledge the US would do everything it could to seek
his men's release.
But Gen Aideed's greatest advantage from playing the hostage card is perhaps
an intangible one. By forcing the US to the negotiating table, Gen Aideed
has increased his stature in the eyes of all Somalis. His enemies will have
greater cause to fear him. And if the present ceasefire holds long enough to
allow a resumption of national reconciliation talks, Gen Aideed will be a
significant participant, if not the dominant one, in determining Somalia's
political future.
For its part, the UN Operation in Somalia (Unosom) has acquired its own
internal problems. A question mark hangs over the 30,000-strong military
intervention if President Clinton maintains his commitment to withdrawing
the strategic US contingent in six months' time. Other governments have
hinted they will also withdraw their troops if the Americans depart.
'Somalia is just not worth dying for,' says one UN diplomat, who believes
the need to minimise UN casualties has killed their mandate to disarm
Somalia's warlords forcefully. The UN's first attempt at peace enforcement,
as opposed to peacekeeping, has proved an impossible task in the face of Gen
Aideed's defiance.
From now on, UN officials say disarmament and political initiatives will
have to come from the Somalis themselves. More than 14,000 UN troops will
still patrol Mogadishu, backed by an extra 5,000-strong US force in case of
trouble, but the days of weapons sweeps across neighbourhoods and the
storming of militia strongholds are over.
Somalia's rival clans now face the problem of how to contain Gen Aideed's
ambitions without the help of the UN.
Mr Ali Mahdi Mohammed, a hotelier-turned-warlord who controls the north
section of Mogadishu, distrusts the UN's policy of appeasement.
'The time for dialogue has collapsed,' he argues. 'Aideed has always broken
his agreements. This interlude will only give him time to reorganise and
resume the fighting.'
He adds that if the US soldiers pull out 'the situation will revert to the
killing and starvation we had before they stepped in.'

FT  16 OCT 93 / Japan ready to end ban on rice imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

JAPAN has informally floated a proposal to lift its ban on rice imports
after a six-year moratorium period to 1999, according to trade negotiators
in Tokyo and Geneva.
In a second initiative late yesterday in Geneva, Japan is also offering to
harmonise at low levels its tariffs on non-ferrous metals, and cut by at
least 50 per cent its tariff peaks on a further 150 textile items.
A US trade negotiator described the initiative, unveiled during a full
meeting of Uruguay round participants aimed at taking stock of progress in
negotiations, as 'an additional concrete step' towards successful completion
of the Uruguay round of world trade talks.
The rice proposal, which was made unofficially during intensive bilateral
discussions on reform of farm trade with the US in Geneva, will only be
presented formally once the US and the EC settle differences on farm
subsidies and market access for agriculture products, an official said.
Under the plan, Japan will accept tarification of rice after a six-year
grace period, during which a minimum access level of at least 5 per cent of
its domestic rice consumption will be imported, an official said.
Mr Joe O'Mara, special US trade negotiator for agriculture, said in Geneva
that the two sides were trying to conclude the talks by November 1, ahead of
the December 15 deadline to complete the Uruguay Round negotiations.
Formal headway may yet be frustrated by the refusal of the EC so far to
enter any negotiations on opening its market to more farm imports.
This is largely due to French efforts to review a US-EC agreement on
Europe's subsidised farm exports, and even to withdraw the farm sector from
the Uruguay Round agenda.
News of progress towards a compromise on ending Japan's ban on rice imports
is likely to isolate France on the issue of farm trade, and put fresh
pressure on the EC to negotiate tariff cuts in the sector.
Negotiators in Geneva were quick to note yesterday that France's domestic
problems in selling a farm package were no greater than those of the
Japanese government; if Japan compromises on rice imports for the sake of a
wider agreement, pressure would increase on France to do the same.
A trade negotiator in Geneva said the Japanese initiative on non-ferrous
metals amounted to 'one more area where the rest of the Quad (which groups
the US, Japan, Canada and the EC) are in agreement, and the EC stands in the
way of a package.' Both Canada and the US want tariffs on non-ferrous metals
entirely eliminated.
The welcome for Japan's initiatives was not extended to a new EC market
access package ready to be tabled next week. This proposes adding toys and
vegetable oils to the list of items on which tariffs will be cut to zero,
and cuts average tariffs by about 33 per cent, against a previous offer of
some 23 per cent. One US official, noting that the current US offer achieved
cuts averaging 38-42 per cent, said the EC offer 'hardly passes the laugh
test'.
Meanwhile, in Tokyo, news of the Japanese rice proposal yesterday caused
embarrassment for Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, and his
government, which was quick to deny reports of a tarification accord.
Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, reiterated that Japan had no
intention of subjecting rice to the tarification scheme proposed by the
Gatt.
Meanwhile leaders of the Socialist party, the largest in Mr Hosokawa's
coalition, who staunchly oppose the opening of the rice market, threatened
to pull the party out of the coalition if the cabinet accepted tarification.

FT  16 OCT 93 / French farm policy under fire in Cairns group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the Cairns group of 14 farm exporting nations meet in Geneva this
weekend, there can be little doubt their common bogey will be France, and
the Balladur government's pre-emptive strike against liberalisation of farm
trade.
'Agriculture negotiations in the Uruguay Round are not merely a
transatlantic affair,' said Mr Peter Cook, Australia's trade minister and
chairman of the Cairns group, during meetings in Brussels with top trade
negotiators from both the European Community and the US.
'There are many countries across the developing world that are in much
tougher situations than the French over farm trade, but they are still
playing a positive role in the round,' he said. 'France is likely to find
itself in a situation of splendid isolation. The answer to its problems has
to be found in Europe.'
For the Cairns group, which represents countries ranging from Australia and
Canada to Thailand, Indonesia, Argentina and Uruguay, liberalisation of
trade in farm goods is key to their support for the Uruguay round. Many of
their economies have been severely hit by barriers against exporting to the
EC, Japan and the US.
Subsidised EC exports of surplus farm produce has also devastated farm
prices on world markets, damaging export earnings, and undermining domestic
farm sectors.
The group is expected to deliver at the end of its summit a polite but
unequivocal rebuttal of French aims. It is likely to insist on:
no renegotiation of the US-EC Blair House agreement limiting European
exports of subsidised farm goods;
no removal of farm trade from the Uruguay round agenda;
speedy action by the EC to come forward with significant cuts in tariffs on
its imported farm products.
no exceptions to the rule that quota limits on farm imports should gradually
be replaced by tariffs.
The minimum commitments in the draft Uruguay Round agreement tabled at the
end of 1991 involved tariffs being cut by an average of 36 per cent over six
years, with no imported item escaping with cuts of less than 15 per cent.

A DISPUTE between Bombay brokers and Indian income tax officers which halted

The tax authorities agreed yesterday after extended talks over two days to
unfreeze parcels of shares issued by nine companies, including Reliance
Industries and ACC, the country's largest cement producer.
Tax inspectors last month froze dealings in the share parcels during an
investigation into the affairs of Mr Harshad Mehta, the broker at the centre
of last year's Rs40bn Bombay securities market scandal.
Brokers at the Bombay Stock Exchange, went on strike on Wednesday over the
investigation's disruptive effect.

<TEXT>
TAIWAN Aerospace Corporation yesterday postponed a board meeting scheduled
for October 19 in order to hear proposals from Mr John Cahill, chairman of
British Aerospace, aimed at reviving stalled talks on a proposed joint
venture between the two.
The meeting was to discuss the fate of the troubled plan to produce BAe's RJ
family of regional passenger jets in Britain and Taiwan.
Mr Cahill plans to meet TAC and government officials next week during a
visit to Taiwan by Mr Richard Needham, the UK trade minister, and a group of
UK industrialists.
Collapse of the Avro venture would undermine BAe's plans to improve profits:
the RJ regional jets, now made in Woodford, Cheshire, lose money for the
company. BAe had hoped to return them to profitability by moving some
production to Taiwan.
Taiwan wants to create a civil aircraft industry as part of its industrial
policy, but in recent months the proposed deal with BAe has been criticised
by some bankers and opposition politicians on commercial grounds.
BAe said yesterday Mr Cahill would address three issues in Taiwan: to
promote the restarting of talks which broke up last month, to seek
assurances that the top management at TAC would be 'strengthened', and to
support the trade minister.
Negotiations last month between TAC and BAe in London fell apart over BAe's
refusal to delineate clearly in writing the details of technology transfer
for the RJ family and make a written commitment to co-develop with TAC an
advanced two-engine 'RJX' regional jet.
Since then, the Taiwan government has stressed that the resumption of
negotiations was a matter to be decided by the two companies.
Mr Chiang Ping-kun, minister of economic affairs with responsibility for
trade and industry, said Wednesday that the government, while remaining
committed to developing an aerospace industry, would take no direct part in
such negotiations between two private companies.
TAC said the decision to delay the meeting was made in light of the
forthcoming visit to Taipei by Mr Cahill.
Mr Yang Shih-chien, vice minister for economic affairs, declined to comment
on the possible significance of the TAC decision. He affirmed that the
ministry would not take a direct part. 'We're quite clear that the (Taiwan)
government has already discussed those issues which it should have
discussed,' Mr Yang said.

The Bombay Stock Exchange, which accounts for two-thirds of trading in
India, was closed after brokers went on strike on Wednesday in protest at
the disruptive effect of the investigation. Last year's scandal erupted when
evidence emerged that money was being illegally siphoned out of banks into
the stock market.
Resumption of normal trading on Monday will depend on fulfilment of legal
formalities. The scandal cases are being heard by a special court, which has
to give permission for trading in the stock involved.
Mr AN Kolhatkar, executive director of the exchange, said there would be no
hitch in restarting trading once the special court granted permission.

A NEW strand was added to the growing web of international telecommunication
alliances yesterday when Japan's biggest telephone operator, Kokusai Denshin
Denwa, signed a co-operation pact with Unisource, a three-way joint venture
linking the telecommunications companies of the Netherlands, Sweden and
Switzerland.
The latest partnership is aimed, in the first instance, at allowing
Japanese-based multinationals to maintain data connections with their
subsidiaries in Europe. Other global communications services may be added
later.
Mr Kazuo Yoshida, managing director of business communications at KDD, said
the European deal was 'non-exclusive', meaning that it would not prevent the
Japanese company from continuing to pursue the larger 'Worldsource' venture
launched by AT&amp;T of the US in the spring.
Besides AT&amp;T, other leading international telecommunications companies such
as British Telecom are also seeking to provide 'one-stop' telecommunications
services to multinational businesses.
Unisource, a joint venture between PTT Telecom of the Netherlands, Telia of
Sweden and Swiss Telecom, is designed to enable the telecommunications
companies of these smaller European countries to compete with the industry
giants.

another's disadvantage, so the package can't be done piecemeal. Our call
will be for the biggest, boldest market access package that can be

The EC has so far refused detailed discussion with any trading partners on

FT  16 OCT 93 / Moscow slated over rights: 'Campaign against ethnic

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN government has carried out 'widespread' human rights violations
and used its emergency powers to conduct a campaign against ethnic
minorities in Moscow, according to an international human rights
organisation.
Speaking in Moscow, representatives of the Helsinki Watch group said
thousands were detained, and many beaten, during the past 10 days.
The allegations came as President Boris Yeltsin said Russia would hold a
referendum on a new constitution on December 12 and prosecutors started
presenting charges against the main leaders of an armed attempt to overthrow
him.
Interfax news agency said the General Prosecutor's office had started
pressing charges of organising mass disturbances against former
vice-president Alexander Rutskoi and ex-parliament chief Ruslan Khasbulatov.
Several other rebel leaders were being charged with the same offence, which
carries a maximum sentence of 15 years' jail.
About 17,000 'immigrants', 90 per cent of them from Armenia, Azerbaijan and
Georgia, have been driven out of Moscow in what the city's authorities claim
is an attempt to defeat crime.
In an ironic throwback to pre-perestroika days, 7,000 people were forcibly
detained and expelled under emergency powers which allow the police to expel
anyone without a legal 'residence permit'.
Another 10,000, the police say, have left 'voluntarily', fearing they would
be caught by random police searches and police appeals to Moscow's citizens
to report on illegal immigrants.
Mr Yuri Luzhkov, mayor of Moscow, indicated the authorities were preparing
to extend some of the controls by introducing a new 'visa regime' to replace
the state of emergency, intended to be lifted on Monday.
He said the moves had the full backing of Mr Yeltsin, and welcomed them as a
chance for Russian traders, selling cabbage, to replace Caucasian traders
with their 'exotic fruits'. who have traditionally dominated the Moscow
fruit market.
The markets have been left half empty as the traders from the Caucasus have
fled.
Polls show the drive against ethnic minorities has been highly popular with
Russians, who blame the Caucasians for rising crime.
However, human rights groups and the Georgian, Azerbaijani and Armenian
embassies yesterday insisted that most of those expelled had been political
refugees or honest businessmen.

RUSSIA yesterday unveiled a foreign exchange control system designed to
force exporters to repatriate their dollar earnings.
Developed with the help of France and Italy, which had similar foreign
exchange controls in their recent past, the system will be operated with the
extensive involvement of Russian commercial banks which are entitled to
conduct hard currency operations.
'We have not re-invented the bicycle,' said Mr Victor Melnikov, head of the
central bank's newly-reorganised currency regulation department.
The scheme comes into effect in January for exporters of strategic
commodities such as oil and precious metals and in March for all other
exporters.
It is to operate as follows:
An exporter and his bank will be obliged to sign a 'passport' for any given
export deal. The exporter will take a copy of the 'passport' to customs.
Customs will then provide the necessary export documents. The 'passport'
details will be fed into customs' data base.
Customs will pass on to the bank a document confirming the goods have left
the country. The exporter must also forward a copy of the export documents
to the bank.
The bank is obliged to alert customs if the money is not repatriated by the
time payment for goods is expected. For their services in implementing the
exchange controls, banks will be paid up to 0.15 per cent of the value of
the contract by exporters.
Banks caught violating the procedure face fines amounting to the value of
the contract. Those which cannot cope with the extra burden of enforcing
controls would lose prized licences to conduct hard currency operations.
The biggest obstacle to the system's smooth functioning will be widespread
corruption in customs and banks.
Mr Melnikov said the system's main defence against fraud was its reliance on
three separate sources of information: customs, exporters, and the banks.
Mr Dmitry Tulin, deputy governor of the central bank, said the new system
would mark a serious start to tackling capital flight which has hindered the
country's ability to repay its debts.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Bentsen predicts 2.5-3% growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US inflation is 'well in check' and economic performance is stable, Mr Lloyd
Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, told businessmen in Texas yesterday.
He predicted growth at an annual rate of 2.5-3.0 per cent in the second
half.
Mr Bentsen's comments followed the publication of statistics showing lower
than expected inflation and a narrowing of the merchandise trade deficit in
August.
Consumer prices were flat last month and up by 2.7 per cent in the year to
September, according to Labour Department figures. Separate reports showed
an unexpected decline in the trade deficit to Dollars 9.71bn (Pounds 6.43bn)
in August against Dollars 10.4bn in July and an increase in industrial
production of 0.2 per cent last month.
The figures were better than most analysts had expected and indicated that
the relatively sluggish, private sector-led US recovery is imposing few
strains on the economy.
On Thursday officials reported a zero increase in the core producer price
index last month. The good news on inflation prompted further gains in bond
and share prices on Wall Street as traders discounted the risk of a
tightening of monetary policy in coming months.
The decline in the trade deficit reflected a 3 per cent rise in exports to
Dollars 38.2bn, which more than offset a 1 per cent rise in imports to
Dollars 47.9bn. The increase in exports was led by a Dollars 707m increase
in aircraft sales, a volatile item, but was seen as encouraging by analysts
in view of sluggish trading conditions in many overseas markets.
The trade deficit for the year to August was Dollars 76.8bn up sharply from
Dollars 52.7bn last year, reflecting the US economic recovery.
The 0.2 per cent increase in industrial production last month took the
annual gain to 4.6 per cent. However the Federal Reserve revised down
estimates of production increases in July and August to show gains of 0.2
per cent and 0.1 per cent respectively.
For the third quarter, production is estimated to have risen at an annual
rate of 1.8 per cent. The strongest sectors were business equipment and
construction supplies.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Nobel prize for Mandela and de Klerk
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress, and President
F. W. de Klerk yesterday shared the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize for working to
dismantle South Africa's apartheid regime and for laying the foundations for
peace and democracy in the violence-torn country.
The five-member Norwegian Nobel Committee said that from their different
points of departure, Mr Mandela and Mr de Klerk were being lauded for
reaching agreement on the principles for a transition to a new political
order based on the tenet of one man, one vote.
'By looking ahead to South African reconciliation instead of back at the
deep wounds of the past, they have shown personal integrity and great
political courage,' it said.
In an interview with Norwegian radio soon after the award was announced, Mr
de Klerk said he was overwhelmed by the decision: 'It's a great honour and I
accept it with great humility. I accept it on behalf of all other leaders
who have contributed towards the dynamic process in South Africa.'
He stressed that economic development of South Africa was needed to help end
violence there. 'We are glad to be back in the international community and
that sanctions have been lifted. We hope that investment can come to South
Africa so jobs can be created.'
Mr Mandela described the honour as a 'challenge to us all as co-equal
compatriots to so conduct ourselves that those who seek to foster racial and
ethnic hatred and war are isolated and cauterised'.
The Nobel committee said South Africa had been the symbol of racially
conditioned suppression. 'Mandela's and de Klerk's constructive policy of
peace and reconciliation also points the way to the peaceful resolution of
similar deep- rooted conflicts elsewhere in the world,' where ethnic
disparities cause the bitterest conflicts, it said.
The committee said that while previous Nobel laureates Albert Lutuli and
Desmond Tutu made important contributions to progress towards racial
equality in South Africa, Mr Mandela and Mr de Klerk have taken the process
a big step further.
Professor Francis Sejersted, chairman of the committee, said the South
African duo had bound their political fate to achieving peace.
He said the committee's reasons for yesterday's decision were similar to
those behind the awards to former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in 1990
and to Ms Rigoberta Menchu' Tum, the Guatemalan human rights campaigner,
last year. 'Similar political peace processes are also under way in those
laureates' countries,' he said.
The Nobel Peace Prize, named after Mr Alfred Nobel, the Swedish inventor of
dynamite, comprises a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque for SKr6.7m (Pounds
550,000).
Prof Sejersted believed Mr Mandela and Mr de Klerk would come to Oslo on
December 10 to receive the prize.

FT  16 OCT 93 / US seeks action on Haiti shipping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US, in an attempt to tighten the screws on Haiti's military regime, is
pressing for a Security Council resolution to intercept shipping to and from
the Caribbean nation to prevent any sanctions-busting, a US official said
yesterday, Reuter reports from New York.
Ms Madeleine Albright, Washington's UN ambassador, had begun consultations
with fellow diplomats and was pushing for adoption of the resolution later
in the day.
It would authorise UN members, individually or through regional
organisations, to stop and search vessels suspected of carrying contraband.
The Security Council first imposed sanctions against Haiti in June but
suspended them in August when the country's army rulers appeared to be
abiding by an agreement for the restoration on October 30 of President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, overthrown in a September 1991 military coup.
The council voted unanimously on Wednesday to reimpose the sanctions,
involving an arms and oil embargo and the freezing of funds held abroad.
The council acted after two days of violence by armed men in Port-au-Prince,
the capital, prevented the disembarkation of some 250 US and Canadian troops
sent as part of a UN mission to help with the restoration of democracy.
The situation deteriorated further on Thursday when the justice minister in
a recently-installed pro-Aristide government, Guy Malary, was assassinated
along with two aides.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Poles turn to a quiet and homely figure: Christopher
Bobinski assesses the farmers' leader likely to be Poland's next prime
minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NONE of Poland's four post-communist prime ministers had any experience of
government before taking office, and Waldemar Pawlak, the 34-year-old Polish
Peasant party (PSL) leader set to be designated next week for the post, is
no exception.
The fresh-faced Mr Pawlak, who owns a 20ha (50-acre) farm in Plock province
180km north of Warsaw, differs from Ms Hanna Suchocka, his immediate
predecessor, in that he is better known than she was when she became prime
minister 15 months ago.
Mr Pawlak sprang from obscurity in June 1991 when the PSL, a party scarred
by years of abject collaboration with the communists, chose him as their
leader in a sign of a new beginning. Mr Pawlak fitted the role perfectly. He
had no past to speak of and the party's warring factions were able to
coalesce around him.
He came to the post after joining the party in 1984 as a graduate from
Warsaw Polytechnic's mechanical faculty. Four years later he found himself
heading the local council in Pacyna, the district where he was born.
He was elected on the PSL ticket to parliament in 1989, in the elections
which Solidarity won but which gave the 'ancien regime' parties, including
the communists, their seats under a pre-ballot deal with the then opposition
movement.
In parliament, the soft-spoken and taciturn young deputy attracted the
attention of his colleagues through a passion for back-room political
manoeuvring and an ability to go for the jugular, which he developed as the
group's whip. But it was President Lech Walesa in the middle of 1992 who
gave Mr Pawlak national prominence.
This was after Mr Walesa had toppled an ineffectual cabinet led by Mr Jan
Olszewski and was looking for a candidate for prime minister around whom a
parliamentary majority could be built and who was sufficiently junior to do
as he was told. The plan succeeded temporarily and Mr Pawlak was voted in as
prime minister, but failed to form a government, thanks to last-minute
opposition from Solidarity-based groups who were not ready to see someone
from outside their camp as head of government.
The attempt lasted 33 days and the disappointment it engendered has left a
shadow over Mr Pawlak's relations with Mr Walesa, who he feels let him down.
The incident deepened the traditional mistrust that the peasant population,
of whom Mr Pawlak is a typical if better educated representative, feels
towards the city dwellers. But Mr Walesa gave Mr Pawlak 33 days of
prominence. It was time enough to build a popular image and not enough to
make mistakes spoiling the picture.
He comes across as a sound and homely figure that Poles, after four years of
reform and upheaval, now appear to hanker after. The 33-day episode was an
unexpected bonus from which he profited in the September 19 elections.
In these, the PSL won the vote in the rural areas where 40 per cent of the
population lives and an overall 15 per cent share of the national ballot.
Almost a month later Mr Pawlak continues to perform well in opinion surveys.
Now he has to put together a cabinet, working this time with the former
communist Left Democratic Alliance (SLD). Talks between the two groups over
the past three weeks have shown Mr Pawlak to be a stubborn negotiator. He
knows he holds a strong hand in that he can find other allies with whom to
form a government should the SLD withdraw. This is a luxury the SLD does not
enjoy.
He will be looking for policies from the next cabinet which will improve the
lot of the farmers. That means increased budget support for the sector and
customs barriers against European Community food imports, and Mr Pawlak
knows that he must deliver to his peasant voters.
He is also canny enough to realise that his party needs allies in the towns,
maybe recruited from the small business sector, to break out from the rural
ghetto the PSL now finds itself in.
He is looking too to build bridges with the Catholic church, which itself
needs an ally in parliament.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Francs under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Belgian and French francs suffered renewed attacks yesterday as
financial markets became convinced that the two countries will have to
abandon their strong currency policies and cut interest rates, writes Peter
John. Both currencies recovered levels towards the end of European trading
but this reflected dealers balancing their books ahead of the weekend and
pressure is expected to re-emerge next week.
Mr Neil Mackinnon, currency analyst with Citibank, said: 'There is an
increasing feeling that these economies will have to forget about strong
franc policies.' Once again, the Belgian National Bank intervened to support
the currency, but this made little impact on strong investor concern over
Belgium's forthcoming social pact on wages and employment and the effect
that short-term rates of around 10 per cent are having on the economy. The
D-Mark was consistently above BFr22 yesterday. It closed at BFr21.99, little
changed on its previous close of BFr21.97. French francs were also sold
heavily against the D-Mark and hit a new low of FFr3.5480 yesterday.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Bundesbank president rules out early return to tight ERM
grid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE newly-flexible European Monetary System faces a long probation period
before EC states can return their currencies to the old, tighter grid, Mr
Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, said yesterday.
In his first foreign speech since becoming president of the the German
central bank this month, Mr Tietmeyer said EC states should be 'prudent' in
their monetary policy, while putting their prime focus on real convergence
between their economies.
Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, who has just taken over as governor of the Bank of
France, joined his German counterpart in a symbolic joint appearance at a
Paris conference organised by Les Echos newspaper, to pledge the French
central bank's dedication to 'a policy of credibility and internal and
external stability' for the franc.
Amid reports that the Bank of France intervened yesterday to prop up a franc
affected by Franco-American tensions in the Gatt negotiations, Mr Trichet
gave little encouragement to hopes for an early cut in French interest
rates.
He chose to stress that French long-term rates had fallen to German levels,
so that over 10 years, in the markets' eyes, 'the French and German
currencies are considered approximately the same'.
The Bundesbank itself would continue 'a steady and clear, stability-oriented
monetary policy', Mr Tietmeyer said. This did not exclude 'further cautious
steps to cut our interest rates, when conditions are right'. But he stressed
the Bundesbank view that his country's long-term rates were 'very low
historically, at less than 2 per cent in real terms'.
Both men supported the goal of European monetary union, underlining what
seems to be a new Franco-German consensus on prudent monetary policy and on
necessary economic convergence. But Mr Tietmeyer spelled out a number of
caveats.
He described as utopian any notion that the Maastricht timetable to monetary
union should be accelerated because of this summer's upheaval in the EMS.
Mr Tietmeyer also criticised recent suggestions from Mr Jacques Delors, the
European Commission president, that the EC might consider some form of
controls on the movement of speculators' money, as a means of strengthening
the EMS. Not only would such a plan not work in 'highly developed and
fundamental liberal' economies, but free capital movements were essential to
help necessary adjustments in industrialised economies.
Mr Tietmeyer attacked recent suggestions in Brussels that the European
Commission should set a new macro-economic framework with targets for
interest rates, inflation and perhaps unemployment. 'Choosing this solution
would only recreate the problems which provoked the crisis,' he said.
On financial regulation, the German central bank chief urged stronger
efforts to control derivatives trading and to prevent such assets inflating
and then bursting like 'bubbles'.
He suggested there should be an internationally agreed code of conduct on
derivatives trading, along the lines of a recent Group of 30 study.
Mr Tietmeyer complained that the EC had so far only reached 'an imperfect
compromise' in its March 1993 directive, designed to introduce minimum
capital requirements in derivatives trading from 1996.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Otis shrugs off Russia's ups and downs: How the
multinational liftmaker is coping with uncertainty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR any western company with business in Russia, recent weeks have been a
time of great uncertainty and anxiety. But there is more at stake for Otis
Elevator International than for most foreign manufacturers.
'We're pretty simple people. We just want to get on with the business of
manufacturing and maintaining lifts and looking after our people,' says Mr
George Channin, area director for eastern Europe at Otis.
Mr Channin was talking about the four joint ventures which the world's
largest lift producer has set up in Russia in the past three years.
Otis, part of United Technologies, has spent Dollars 40m-Dollars 50m (Pounds
26m-Pounds 33m) since 1990 on equity stakes in the Russian ventures and one
in Ukraine. It was one of the first US companies to spot the potential of
manufacturing and selling in the former Soviet Union.
The message from the frontline has been 'business as usual'. In the tense
few days before President Boris Yeltsin acted two weeks ago to quell a
revolt by Russia's hardline parliamentarians, Mr Channin was receiving a
stream of phone calls at his Paris office.
They came from expatriates working for Otis in Russia. 'They were almost
going out of their way to call me on routine matters, to let me know that
they were working at usual, and that life goes on,' he says.
For Otis, the rationale for the investment is the same as it always has
been, says Mr Rudolf Kunert, senior vice-president. Whatever happens at the
Kremlin or the Russian parliament, there is a huge need for new or
refurbished lifts in apartment blocks, hospitals and offices.
But the upheavals of the past two years have inevitably affected Otis and
its new partners. Local authorities' tax revenues have failed to keep up
with rampant inflation, so capital spending on equipment such as lifts has
been reduced.
Inflation has also forced Otis to raise its prices, says Mr Kunert, and
taken up a lot of management time. Privatisation in the construction
industry, at least in the big cities, is changing the face of the customer
base for new lifts.
Mr Channin admits that the pace of the reforms in Russia may sometimes have
been slower than Otis originally expected. 'But we have never had any
concrete examples of a reversal,' he says.
Mr Kunert says the company is even a little ahead of where it expected to be
in its Russian business, at any rate in terms of the volume of activity and
the extent of its service network. Some of the ventures are making an
operating profit, at least in roubles.
This month, the denouement of the Russian constitutional crisis has
coincided with a turning point for the US company in Russia. After what Mr
Kunert calls 'two years of hard work', the first Russian-built lift was
being delivered in Moscow.
Now the victory for Mr Yeltsin promises to end some of the uncertainty that
Otis and other western companies have been grappling with in recent months.
'We are relieved to have a result, and we are hopeful that some of the
gridlock on important issues will now be lifted,' says Mr Channin.
'One day there would be an interview with a parliamentarian and things would
seem to be going one way, then there would be an interview with the other
side and they would say the opposite.'
But Otis, in any case, is sticking to its long-term Russian strategy. Mr
Kunert even hints that it could extend its presence, plugging gaps in Rus
Otis, which maintains some 40,000 lifts.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Investors wary as Romanian 'pyramid' totters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CLUJ, ROMANIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DOWN AT the Cluj sports hall, business is not what it was. Just a few months
ago, thousands of eager investors queued to deposit their money at the banks
of computer terminals inside, hoping for fantastic returns. Now they are
counted in scores and the menacing-looking marshals stand outside with
nothing to do.
The scene by the sports hall is the most visible sign that trouble may be
coming to this Transylvanian town - and to Romania as a whole.
A 'pyramid' investment scheme in Cluj that has attracted hundreds of
millions of dollars of deposits by promising a sevenfold return in three
months appears to be wobbling. Since about 3m Romanians - one sixth of the
adult population - have invested in the scheme, the result could be
disastrous.
For four days last week, the money-multiplying scheme, which is known as
Caritas and has created thousands of lei millionaires in the
ethnically-mixed western province of Transylvania, failed to pay out to
investors for the first time in its 18 months of operation.
Payments have since resumed, with Caritas's owner, Mr Ioan Stoica, blaming
the problem on a computer fault: 'The Caritas money circuit is safe and
sound and going strong,' he said last weekend. But investors in Cluj say
confidence has been shaken, and fear Caritas will soon run out of cash.
'I hope I will be able to cash my 40m lei (Pounds 26,500) by December, but I
fear the scheme will collapse before then,' said one taxi driver.
An elderly man said: 'Maybe it will end soon but it's the only chance we
have of paying our winter heating and food bills.' He had travelled 200km to
sink cash into the scheme this week.
Other locals are more inclined to count their blessings. 'God bless Mr
Stoica,' said one. He spoke of the colour television, fridge and stereo that
his family had bought with the profits they had made from the scheme.
The scheme, the largest of many in post-communist Romania, has had a
magnetic appeal in a country where real earnings have dropped by a third in
the past three years and annual inflation is approaching 300 per cent.
Caritas appears to work like a chain letter. New players deposit between
Lei20,000 and Lei160,000.
Three months later Caritas, while collecting from depositors and taking a 10
per cent commission, pays out eight times the investment.
Little is known about Mr Stoica, except that he is a former bookkeeper from
the Transylvanian town of Brasov, has an economics degree, and is believed
to have worked abroad. He has made millions of dollars from the scheme,
paying the equivalent of Dollars 30m in taxes between April and August of
this year alone. Recently, he opened a grocery in Cluj and is talking of
starting a chain of supermarkets and a bank.
As for Cluj itself, Caritas has brought a boom. 'Whatever Stoica's secret,
it's worked for us,' says one shopkeeper. Property prices have rocketed
fivefold, making a studio apartment at least as costly as in the capital,
Bucharest. According to local officials, there has also been a marked
increase in crime and a falling-off in the desire to work.
One reason for Caritas's success compared with other failed pyramid schemes
is the backing of the mayor, Mr Gheorghe Funar, who is also leader of the
country's largest nationalist party.
He encourages Romanians to follow him in putting money into the scheme,
saying it is 'a legal and clean affair'.
Most in Cluj are happy not to question that judgment. If the truth turns out
to be otherwise, however, the backlash will be fast and furious.

FT  16 OCT 93 / BR braced for further reduction in state funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL is braced for fresh cuts in the funding it receives from the
government as part of the drive to meet public spending targets for the next
three years.
BR expects ministers to reduce the external financing limit which fixes the
level of funds available to it each year on top of those it generates
internally.
This is already set to fall from about Pounds 2bn last year to Pounds 960m
in 1995-96, even if there are no further cuts.
The Department of Transport's Pounds 6.5bn budget has come under the close
scrutiny of the cabinet's EDX committee which aims to reach a settlement on
spending with all government departments by the end of the month.
It is understood that no such settlement on transport spending has yet been
reached. But sizeable cuts are widely anticipated, with the roads programme
and planned government contributions to large-scale infrastructure projects
said to be prime targets, as well as BR.
The threat of deeper cuts comes as ministers are pondering how to respond to
the prospect of a damaging backbench rebellion over the government's rail
privatisation proposals.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, and Mr Roger Freeman, transport
minister, are holding meetings with Tory MPs concerned that BR should be
able to bid against the private sector for franchises to operate passenger
services.
A Lords amendment proposing this was carried in July in spite of being
opposed by the government.
Mr MacGregor must now decide whether to reject the amendment when the rail
privatisation bill returns to the Commons within the next month, risking a
demoralising defeat if enough Tory backbenchers defy the government whips by
voting with the opposition.
Earlier this week, the government used a Lords debate on the bill to
introduce a separate amendment in what appeared to be an attempt to stave
off the threatened Commons rebellion.
The amendment makes it a duty for the government to promote management
buyouts of franchises by BR staff.
It was agreed without a vote in spite of Labour warnings it could contravene
European Community competition rules.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Britain to drop project for new Pounds 3bn N-missile: RAF
hit as government warned more cuts may cripple services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is expected next week to shelve plans for a new nuclear
missile for the Royal Air Force which would have cost up to Pounds 3bn.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, is set to make the announcement on
Monday at the start of a two-day Commons debate on defence.
The decision means the RAF faces losing its nuclear mission after its
current WE177 bombs become obsolete.
Mr Rifkind is also expected to outline the government's views on the future
of the royal dockyards including moves towards private-sector ownership,
probably from 1996. The dockyards at Devonport and Rosyth are now managed by
private-sector companies under contract.
Savings from these measures are seen as going some of the way to responding
to Treasury pressure for further cuts in defence spending. The Treasury is
believed to be seeking a reduction of about Pounds 1bn in the defence
budget, currently Pounds 23.7bn for next year. This would be in in addition
to cuts of Pounds 1.05bn over two years, imposed last November.
The Ministry of Defence argues that the armed forces cannot sustain further
cuts unless Britain reduces or abandons some of its defence commitments in
the UK, Europe or overseas.
Sir Nicholas Bonsor, Conservative chairman of the Commons defence committee,
warned yesterday that more reductions could cripple the services. Lord
Bramall, a former chief of defence staff, called on Mr John Major, the prime
minister, to intervene against further personnel and equipment cuts.
The decision to dispense with the new missile, which would have been a joint
effort with either France or the US, reflects both the squeeze on spending
and the dramatic change in the strategic situation since discussions began
almost six years ago.
It appeared increasingly unlikely that Britain would be able to test a
warhead for the missile, because of the US moratorium on testing and
forthcoming negotiations on a global ban. Both the Labour and Liberal
Democrat parties have opposed the new missile.
Funding for the air-launched weapon - known as the tactical air-to-surface
missile or TASM - was included in the MoD's secret long-term costings.
However, this sum is understood to have been much less than the Pounds
2bn-Pounds 3bn overall cost estimated by experts, and the savings will come
in the medium rather than short term.
The two missiles being considered as the basis for the project were the
Supersonic Low-Altitude Target (Slat) made by Martin Marietta of the US, and
the Air-Sol Longue Portee, an extended-range version of a missile already in
service with the French air force.
An earlier candidate, a nuclear version of Boeing's Short-Range Attack
Missile, was cancelled by the US in 1991.
Aerospatiale, the state-controlled French company which has been working on
the ASLP project, said yesterday: 'It is very unlikely that the French
government will continue alone.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
METRA, the Finnish industrial group, returned to profit, after financial
items, of FM92m (Dollars 16.1m) in the six months to the end of August from
a loss of FM65m in the same period last year. It was helped by rapid sales
growth at Wartsila Diesel, its diesel engine division.
Sales at the unit were ahead by 98 per cent at FM2.8bn, pushing up group
sales to FM5.52bn, a 48 per cent increase over the previous year's figure of
FM3.74bn.
The weaker value of the markka, heavily devalued following its flotation
last autumn, contributed, but Metra said it had benefited from a surge in
worldwide demand, especially for its power plants. Metra said it held more
than 20 per cent of the world market for power plants over 1MW.
Demand was strongest in Asia Pacific. Metra said penetration of the Chinese
market was paying off. Almost one-third of Wartsila's FM3.5bn order book was
accounted for by China.
Metra said sales in its Sanitec household ceramics business were up by
one-third to FM1.24bn. The third core division, the locks and security
device maker Abloy, increased sales by 28 per cent to FM849m.
Metra said it expected similar profits growth to continue in the rest of the
year.
Amer, the Finnish consumer group which includes Wilson Sporting Goods in the
US, yesterday reported pre-tax profits of FM41m in the six months to the end
of August, up sharply from FM25m the previous year.
Sales were ahead, by 13 per cent, to FM3.76bn. But Amer said the figures
were flattered by the lower value of the Finnish markka following its
effective devaluation last autumn. Some 68 per cent of the company's sales
are outside Finland, with North America making up 46 per cent.
Excluding exchange rate factors, sales were down 5 per cent. This included a
4 per cent decline in dollar terms in its sporting goods division.

CAP Gemini Sogeti, the French computer services company, stayed in the red
in the first half of this year with a net loss of FFr197.5m (Dollars 34.9m)
and warned that it was unlikely to return to profit until next year.
The group, in which Daimler Benz of Germany has a 34 per cent stake, last
year went into deficit for the first time with a net loss of FFr72m for the
1992 financial year.
It has been struggling to adjust to a sharp downturn in demand in its main
markets, particularly France, Germany and Spain.
Cap Gemini said that it would be 'futile to hope for an improvement in the
economic situation during the second half of the year' and that it did not
expect its performance to improve until 1994.
Cap Gemini benefited in the first half of last year from the proceeds of the
sale of a property near the Arc de Triomphe in Paris which contributed to an
exceptional profit of FFr154.5m. As a result it stayed in the black with net
profits of FFr142.5m during the first half of 1992. Without the property
sale it would have made a net deficit of FFr118.3m.

Belge

ROYALE Belge, the Belgian insurer, pushed up pre-tax profits in the first
half of 1993 by 32 per cent, from BFr3.6bn to BFr4.75bn (Dollars 135m) on
the back of a strong increase in net investment gains.
Royale Belge, which is controlled by UAP, the French insurer, cautioned
against expecting a similar rise in the second half. This year investment
gains were concentrated in the first half, whereas in 1992 they were spread
across the whole year, the company explained.
Profits for the full year would probably rise by 10 per cent after tax, said
Mr Jean-Pierre Gerard, the company's chief executive. In 1992, the group
recorded a net consolidated profit of BFr4.4bn, up 3.6 per cent on 1991.
The group's operating results rose by only 1.4 per cent from BFr2.7bn in the
first half of 1992, to BFr2.74bn in the first half of this year. But
investment gains nearly doubled to BFr2.39bn, mainly through the sale of
property and shares.
Turnover in the first half of this year increased by 8.2 per cent to
BFr53.7bn (BFr49.6bn), with premium income rising from BFr33.8bn to nearly
BFr36bn.
The company said that its workplace accidents and reinsurance business had
recovered well.

<TEXT>
SKOPBANK, the third largest Finnish commercial bank, cut net operating
losses to FM870m (Dollars 153.17m) in the first eight months of 1993 from
FM2.23bn as credit losses eased, expenses fell and income from financial
operations increased.
The bank said its full-year loss was now likely to be less than the FM2.1bn
predicted at the start of the year.
'The need for additional capital to ensure solvency will reduce
considerably,' it added. The bank, majority owned by the government
guarantee fund, has already received capital injections from the state to
help it weather the Finnish banking crisis. Its total income more than
tripled to FM460m from FM144m.

<TEXT>
KEMIRA, the Finnish state-owned chemicals group which is on the government's
privatisation list, swung to a FM168m (Dollars 29.6m) profit after financial
items in the first eight months, from a FM173m loss in the same 1992 period.
It still expects its full-year result to be negative, because of the
seasonal nature of its fertiliser activities, although the loss will be much
lower than last year's FM345m deficit.
The group's seven main divisions all increased turnover, contributing to a
15 per cent growth in overall net sales to FM8.18bn.
Operating income before depreciation rose 44 per cent to FM1.29bn, or 15.8
per cent of net sales. Full year sales are forecast at FM12bn, and operating
income at around FM1.68bn.

'minimal' and operating profits were up 5 per cent to Pounds 3.9m.
US sales rose 77.7 per cent to Pounds 19.9m and operating profits were up to
Pounds 1.3m from Pounds 800,000. Sales from the rest of the world rose 21.4

FT  15 OCT 93 / JP Morgan's 48% rise sustains pace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BUOYANT trading and corporate finance revenues helped New York banking group
JP Morgan post a 48 per cent increase in third-quarter earnings to Dollars
468m yesterday.
The results were better than most Wall Street analysts had expected. But
some investors were disappointed at the modest decline in trading earnings
from the record second quarter. Along with some profit-taking after the
sector's strong run, this left the share price down Dollars 5/8 at Dollars
77 7/8 on the New York Stock Exchange at midday.
Sir Dennis Weatherstone, the bank's chairman, remarked that 'the year so far
has presented plentiful opportunities, and we've been prepared to capitalise
on them around the world'. He was particularly pleased with the bank's
return on equity, which rose to 23.9 per cent from 18.8 per cent a year ago.
Trading revenues again made the biggest contribution to the bottom line.
Although they failed to match the record Dollars 520m achieved in the second
quarter, they remained strong at Dollars 464m, up 50 per cent from a year
ago thanks to big returns from the trading of debt instruments, swaps and
other interest rate contracts, particularly in Europe and emerging markets.
Although trading remains at the core of JP Morgan's business, analysts said
yesterday that they were impressed with the bank's efforts to boost earnings
from other lines. In particular, they singled out the 14 per cent increase
in corporate finance revenues to Dollars 140m. The improvement was due
mostly to a rise in fees from the underwriting of securities issues.
Other business segments also showed strong growth. Investment management
fees rose 20 per cent to Dollars 116m, operational services fees (primarily
from custody, clearing and brokerage services) climbed 14 per cent to
Dollars 122m, and gains from investments in equity and fixed-income
securities edged ahead to Dollars 98m.
Other revenues soared to Dollars 179m, including a big gain on selling part
of an investment in Hospital Corporation of America.
Net interest income fell slightly to Dollars 439m.
One area that may have concerned some investors was non-interest expenses,
which rose 18 per cent to Dollars 882m during the quarter. The bulk of the
increase, however, was attributable to higher profit-related payments to
employees.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Ruling council chosen in Malawi
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OPPOSITION leaders in Malawi yesterday gave qualified approval to the
appointment of a three-man presidential council to take over executive
authority.
The appointment appears to mark the effective end of the rule of President
Hastings Banda, who is in South Africa recovering from a brain operation
which was carried out 10 days ago.
Mr Gwanda Chakuamba, who was appointed secretary-general of the ruling
Malawi Congress party only last week, heads the council.
Its other two members are Mr John Tembo and Mr Robson Chirwa, both cabinet
ministers.
Spokesmen for opposition parties represented on a National Consultative
Council (NCC), which is negotiating an election timetable and procedure with
the government, have supported the decision to form a presidential council
as a necessary interim measure.
But they claim that the NCC has an agreement with the government according
to which the presidential council will reconvene parliament within seven
days.
They also say it is pledged to amend the constitution to allow a neutral,
caretaker president, with limited powers, to hold office until elections in
May.
Mr Chakuamba, a former government minister imprisoned on charges of sedition
in 1980, was granted an amnesty in July.
The amnesty followed a referendum in which a majority voted to switch to a
multi-party political system. Before his elevation to the key post in the
party, Mr Chakuamba had been actively lobbying on behalf of opposition
groups.
Referring to the pledges, Mr Mordecai Msisha, for the Alliance for
Democracy, said: 'If they don't do this, there will be a crisis'.
However, in an interview with the FT yesterday, Mr Chakuamba denied that any
specific undertaking had been made. While recognising that 'the NCC has a
major role to play', he claimed: 'I have not looked at their proposals yet'.
Asked whether the presidential council would reconvene parliament to amend
the constitution, he said the triumvirate had not yet had an opportunity to
discuss the matter, since Mr Tembo was in South Africa with Dr Banda.
Reports from the clinic where Dr Banda is recuperating say his progress is
satisfactory.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Israelis urged to free Palestinians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TABA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAELI and Palestinian peacemakers hammered out a comprehensive agenda on
security and civilian issues to implement a framework peace agreement
yesterday and set up a sub-committee to decide the fate of up to 11,500
Israeli-held Palestinian prisoners.
On the second day of talks at the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba, the
Palestinian delegation, led by Mr Nabil Shaath, pressed the Israelis for the
quick release of Palestinian prisoners. The Israelis refused to grant a
Palestinian demand for a separate committee or to make an immediate gesture
of releasing some prisoners, but agreed to establish a sub-committee dubbed
'confidence-building measures' to deliberate on prisoners, deportees and
fugitives.
'We expect decisions on prisoners as soon as possible,' said Mr Ahmed
Khalili, a strategic and security expert on the Palestinian delegation. 'We
expect gestures as soon as possible. The Israelis understand the urgency of
the matter.'
Both sides also agreed an agenda for the talks, which resume in Taba next
Wednesday, but refused to make it public after the Israelis objected. Among
the items which are known to be on the agenda are the smooth transfer of
power from the Israeli military administration in the occupied territories
to a Palestinian authority; the territorial delimiting of the Jericho area
from which Israeli troops will withdraw; rights of passage for Jewish
settlers through Palestinian-controlled areas and for Palestinians through
Israeli-controlled areas, especially border crossings to Egypt and Jordan;
and the timetable for Israeli military withdrawal from Jericho and Gaza.
In a joint statement issued late yesterday by Gen Uzi Dayan, deputy head of
the Israeli delegation, both sides stressed the 'positive atmosphere' of the
talks.
Many observers said the success, so far, of the talks was largely due to the
extraordinary relationship established early on between Mr Shaath and Gen
Amnon Shahak, the head of the Israeli delegation, and their willingness to
quickly smooth over differences and present a unified public front to the
press. Both men broke off talks yesterday to stroll along the beach and chat
at a picnic table.
'We came here to work and to talk, to get the work done and to get down to
business and we have started,' said Gen Dayan. 'We came to make friends and
I hope it can show that already we started to be friends and I hope and wish
we shall make peace.'
Both sides said the two days of talks had been remarkable for getting
through a long list of procedural details allowing substantive issues to be
worked on from next Wednesday. Under the framework peace agreement both
sides must agree a protocol for Israeli military withdrawal from Jericho and
Gaza by December 13.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Sweden to spend SKr11bn on refugees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SWEDISH government is to spend SKr11.7bn (Dollars 1.48bn) in the current
budget year to cope with some 75,000 refugees, mainly from former
Yugoslavia, writes Hugh Carnegy in Stockholm. The mounting cost has bloated
the country's already-large budget deficit.
Sweden has taken in more ex-Yugoslav refugees than any European country
after Germany, Switzerland and Austria. But the government has decided it
will now take fewer because of the rising cost and mounting political
pressures at home.
Prime minister Carl Bildt last week called at the Council of Europe summit
in Vienna for other states to carry a larger share of the burden. Failure to
do so 'means turning your back on the joint European responsibility that we
all have.'
Sweden has taken in more than 65,000 ex-Yugoslavs in the past two years. ,
In June, it agreed to give 42,000 refugees from Bosnia Hercegovina the right
of permanent residence. The cases of thousands more are still being
considered.
The Swedish government estimates that up to 30,000 relatives will join those
offered residency and has provided for a further influx of 6,000 refugees,
most from former Yugoslavia, in the year to June 1994.
The cost of coping with such numbers has been one of the factors preventing
the government getting on top of a growing budget deficit, which is set to
hit SKr215bn, or 15 per cent of GDP, in the 1993-94 budget year. This year's
SKr11.7bn allocation for refugees follows SKr10.5bn spent last year and is
almost double the total three years ago.
The influx of refugees has also provoked an increasing debate over
immigration. Until the latest wave, Sweden had accepted 250,000 political
refugees over the previous 30 years, many from South America and the Middle
East.
But the recent surge has coincided with the country's worst recession in 50
years and unprecedented levels of unemployment, prompting occasional
outbursts by small right-wing groups.
Mr Bildt's government wants to move those granted residence out of temporary
housing into local community accommodation as quickly as possible. But local
authorities, burdened by housing shortages and unemployment averaging 13 per
cent, are hesitant. The government has recently announced a scheme to pay
local councils SKr24,000 per refugee on top of the costs it is already
bearing, to encourage quicker acceptance of the newcomers.

FT  15 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo doubts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The unusual move by Lasmo to reject publicly the decision by Moody's to
downgrade the company's debt did little to reassure the market. Many
industry watchers viewed the statement as a sign of nerves rather than
positive action to quell any uncertainty over the stock.
However, analysts were in agreement that the downgrading was not unexpected
and the rating would have little effect on the company's strategy. The real
impact was likely to be on the already uncertain sentiment surrounding
Lasmo. One source reported some unease among US brokers - recent supporters
of the stock.
Also affecting the stock was a rumour that Warburg had downgraded its
dividend forecast and recommended a switch out of the stock. Warburg,
long-time sellers of Lasmo, denied any downgrading. Mr Alan McDonald said
that although the broker preferred a stock such as Enterprise the stance on
Lasmo had not altered.
In slightly above average volume of 3.9m the shares slipped back 1 1/2 to
136p.
Elsewhere in the oils sector Enterprise Oil continued to move ahead, buoyed
by its recent add-on discovery and also, according to one analyst, a
shortage of the stock. The price increased 8 to 479p. Burmah reportedly
suffered the reverse problem and an overhang of stock was one of the reasons
said to have driven its fall of 12 to 754p. Pittencrieff jumped ahead 21 to
366p largely on the back of its telecommunications interests.
Food manufacturing stocks were under pressure as evidence of continued
margin pressure in the sector was seen. First, came the annoucement from
Tesco that it was slashing the price of milk, hitting shares in Northern
Foods and Unigate, two of the country's biggest dairy companies. Then, news
that BSN, the French food giant, was beginning a discounting campaign,
albeit in coupon form, undermined sentiment further.
However, Unilever again sparkled as sentiment towards brands, particularly
on Wall Street, improves. The shares added 18 to 1094p.
Tesco's move kept worries alive over margin pressure among supermarket
stocks. Tesco shares slipped 3 to 202p, J Sainsbury 4 to 415p, Kwik Save 9
to 668p and Argyll Group 5 to 291p.
Tobacco and financial services group BAT was in demand, the shares advancing
10 to 468p, after US securities house Sanford Bernstein was reported to have
upgraded Philip Morris from hold to outperform.
The securities house was said to have cited a resumption of earnings growth
and a change in strategy and an increase in premium cigarette brands.
Office equipment group Danka Business jumped 26 to 305p, after Credit
Lyonnais placed around 1.2m shares with institutions at 263p, a share. The
stock had been part of Danka's public offer to raise nearly Dollars 75m that
was made on Wednesday in the US.
Among transport stocks, troubled container leasing group Tiphook, shed 4 to
137p, on vague talk that the company may be considering calling on investors
for cash.
The placing of the rump of the Pounds 215m rights issue from Tarmac helped
to send the share price down 3 to 140p. The placing by Cazenove was,
according to one analyst, a little larger than expected. The company
announced a 87.3 per cent take-up of the issue.
Shares in Hunting, the oil, aviation and defence group fell 16 to 233p, with
BZW, the company's broker, said to have led the day's selling, after the
company reported interim figures just below market expectations. Profits
improved Pounds 4.3m to Pounds 17.7m but sounded a note of caution about the
aviation side of the business, in spite of a favourable outlook for oil, and
defence.
Hunting's figures were the second set of results in the aerospace sector
this week to disappoint the market. The first came from FR Group, where the
shares yesterday benefited from bargain hunting ending a penny ahead at
225p, after several dull sessions.
That poor sentiment was also seen in aerospace and medical equipment group
Smiths Industries where the shares lost 15 to 356p, in nervous trading ahead
of next week's results. Several large lines of stock were on offer and talk
that the company may make a provision of around Pounds 8m on its aerospace
side once again did the rounds.
Engineering group FKI put on 6 to 171p, as brokers just back from a visit to
the company's US operations recommended the stock.
A round of upbeat visits and presentations to City institutions by British
Aerospace did much to help the shares shrug off news that the Government of
Taiwan would play no part in the company's attempts to salvage its proposed
regional jets joint venture with Taiwan Aerospace Corporation(TAC). The
shares gained 11 to 419p, in trade of 2.7m with analysts once again
stressing the point that the deal was no longer financially critical to the
future of BAe. News of job cuts at the group was also well received by
market watchers.
General buying of William Cook saw the shares move 17 ahead to 281p. Among
motor stocks, fears of asbestosis claims from Africa and India for T&amp;N,
following a hard-hitting documentary programme on UK radio, weakened the
shares. They closed 5 lower at 175p.
Among trusts, Abtrust Scotland remained unchanged at 28p after Panmure
Gordon crossed a block of 4 1/2 m shares, as one institution sold its 13 per
cent stake to several other funds.
Thorn EMI, undermined in recent sessions over compact disc inquiry worries
on both sides of the Atlantic, slid further as SG Warburg was said to have
placed nearly 3m shares at 890p. Thorn closed at 906p, down 14.
Profit-taking in Royal Bank of Scotland saw the shares lose 11 to 334p.
National Westminster put on 4 to 559p in trade of 4m, after it reported
record figures from NatWest Bancorp, its US subsidiary.

News of the Dollars 22bn merger between Bell Atlantic and
Tele-Communications Inc sent telecoms shares surging, with US buyers said to
be prominent. 'There's a wall of money coming over from the Atlantic,' said
one leading telecoms specialist. 'Multi-media is now seen as the place to
be, and everyone wants a piece of the action.'
There was also speculation that Cable and Wireless is in discussion with the
US telecoms giant AT&amp;T over forming a global alliance in business
communications. Although rumoured for some time, analysts said that
Wednesday's monster deal had given fresh impetus to all speculative tie-ups
in the industry. Cable shares jumped 26 to 953p in turnover of 4.1m.
Vodafone added 10 1/2 to 551p, BT 6 1/2 to 447p and Securicor 17 to 787p.

FT  15 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Greycoat move expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPECULATION that institutional investors in Greycoat are close to a new deal
to save the stricken property company sent its securities climbing sharply
yesterday. The ordinary shares jumped 6 to 27p with over 3m traded, while
the preference shares added 4 3/4 to 56 1/2 p. In late trading, talk that a
statement was coming this morning fuelled expectations that new
restructuring talks were well advanced.
Greycoat announced two days ago that several approaches had been made and
the market was yesterday attempting to put flesh on the bones of any
proposed deal. All the major stakeholders figured in the latest speculation,
with UK Active Value Fund, advised by corporate financiers Mr Brian Myerson
and Mr Julian Treger, and controlling 18 per cent of Greycoat's ordinary
shares, prominent.
One source close to the talks said that the terms being drafted would
address the requirements of the preference holders by offering a conversion
into the ordinary's. A rights issue is likely to be included, although
speculation that this would involve a Pounds 60m issue at 2 shares for one
was dismissed as 'wide of the mark' by a Greycoat source.

FT  15 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities recover from early weakness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON stock market rallied from early losses to close firmly yesterday
as traders decided that an unexpectedly large fall in unemployment last
month did not change the City of London's perceptions of the short-term
outlook. Although the unemployment figures indicated stronger economic
recovery than suggested by the fall in manufacturing output announced on
Wednesday, analysts remained convinced that UK base rates will be cut soon,
probably at Budget time in November.
In early dealings, the stock market appeared confused as it measured the
implications of this week's batch of economic data. Shares gained ground at
first, reflecting the view that Wednesday's news on manufacturing output and
domestic inflation had strengthened the chances for a rate cut and reduced
the likelihood of tax increases in November.
But the announcement that unemployment had fallen by 13,600 in September
confused these expectations and the stock market fell sharply as bond prices
turned downwards. At worst, the FT-SE Index was more than 13 points off at
3,067.5, although trading volume was fairly modest.
The London market soon steadied, but the recovery which pushed the Footsie
into plus territory was triggered by strength in the US bond market and on
Wall Street, which gained 12 Dow points in UK hours, in response to US
producer price statistics.
Increased volume in equities as the market moved higher appeared to indicate
underlying confidence among leading institutional investors. The final
reading of 3,086.3 on the FT-SE Index showed a net rise of 5.4 on the
session.
Seaq volume of 618.2m shares compared with 659.2m on Wednesday when retail
business was worth a healthy Pounds 1.5bn. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index slid 3.9
to 3,464.4, with non-Footsie trading making up around 61 per cent of the
total.
'This week's economic data have added little to the argument over prospects
for a base rate cut,' was the view of one leading house, which held to its
prediction of a one per cent cut in base rates, probably around the time of
the Budget which will probably bring around Pounds 5bn to Pounds 6bn in
higher taxes, spread over the next three years.
With domestic factors now on hold until the Budget, the London stock market
has moved more closely in tandem with other European bourses this week. UK
strategists remain convinced that, despite the unwillingness of the Bank of
France, interest rates will be cut in Europe very soon, thus opening the way
for the cut in UK base rates which the market seeks.
The outstanding feature of the market yesterday was the alert prompted among
telecommunication stocks by the Dollars 22bn bid from Bell Atlantic of the
US for Tele-Communications Inc, which opened up the range of opportunities
for global inter-active entertainment and information networks.
Stores and similar retail stocks moved narrowly around overnight levels as
confidence in base rate prospects was recovered. Banks, which are also prime
beneficiaries of rate cuts, were mostly a shade firmer. The final picture in
the marketplace appeared optimistic, with traders noting that buyers had
again appeared when share prices weakened.

FT  15 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LITTLE life was breathed into Footsie futures trading yesterday, writes
Christine Buckley. However, as the activity comprised a slide followed by a
rally, the December contract ended the day in exactly the same shape as it
had started it,
The opening of the contract on the FT-SE 100 surprised some traders who had
expected a weak start reflecting the poor sentiment over recent economic
data. The contract began up at 3,109 but the positive start soon diminished
and swiftly moved into a slide.
With dealers becoming nervous and starting to open arbitrage positions, the
contract slipped below the 3,100 mark and continued down. For a substantial
part of the morning session it traded below fair value. The bleakest point
came about three hours into the session when the contract touched 3,087.
But after lunch a ripple of optimism moved through the market fuelled by
hopes of a strong Wall Street opening and the resurgence of
interest-rate-cut hopes.
The contract's closing at 3,109 - 6 points below the day's high - marked a 3
point lead over the fair value premium to cash which is about 21 points.
The afternoon optimism continued with after-hours business reported as
brisk.
Traded options had moderate volume at 30,188. In stock options Cable and
Wireless was most traded at 1,874 lots.

FT  15 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Inflation data helps to lift
US stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
GOOD inflation and earnings news, declining bond yields, and more positive
fall-out from Wednesday's big merger deal helped US stock markets post solid
gains yesterday, lifting most indices to record highs in the process, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 18.44 at 3,621.63. All
the other main indices ended at record highs. The more broadly based
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 rose 5.34 to 466.83, the Amex composite 5.80 to
481.65, and the Nasdaq composite 6.44 to 785.41. Trading volume on the NYSE
was exceptionally heavy at 353m shares.
Release of the September producers prices index had been eagerly awaited by
investors, and when it came out yesterday they were not disappointed. The
PPI rose only 0.2 per cent last month, and the 'core' index (minus the
volatile food and energy components) was actually flat in September. The
figures sparked a strong rally in bond prices, lowering the yield on the
30-year issue to a new all-time low of 5.851 per cent.
The good inflation news and the fall in bond yields set the stage for early
rises in stock prices, although it was not until a round of computerised
buying programs hit the markets mid-morning that prices began to put up
substantial gains. Other positive factors, including strong earnings from
Chrysler and a host of banks, and continued buying linked to the recently
announced merger between Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications Inc, were
also behind the buying, which pushed the broader and secondary indices to
new peaks.
Chrysler led the markets higher with a gain of Dollars 3 1/4 at Dollars 51
3/4 after reporting third quarter earnings of Dollars 1.13 a share, almost
double the 62 cents a share earned at the same stage last year. The news
lifted other car stocks, with General Motors advancing Dollars 1 1/8 to
Dollars 44 3/4 and Ford adding Dollars 2 1/4 at Dollars 57 1/2 , all in
heavy trading.
Bell Atlantic continued to reach new highs, rising another Dollars 1 3/4 to
Dollars 67 5/8 as analysts welcomed its planned merger with TCI. The latter,
traded on the Nasdaq market, rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 32 7/8 , and
partially-owned Liberty Media, which will also be bought by Bell, rose
Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 31 1/2 . Time Warner rose Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars
46 1/2 , Cablevision added Dollars 2 at Dollars 65 5/8 , and Comcast climbed
Dollars 1 to Dollars 40 5/8 .
Canada
TORONTO stocks rose sharply in moderate trading. The TSE-300 composite index
gained 33.17 points, or 0.81 per cent, to 4,144.96, with advancing issues
outnumbering declines 400 to 358. Volume fell to 61.01m from 61.40m shares
yesterday.

FT  15 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Zurich registers fifth
consecutive record high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses moved in different directions yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
ZURICH refused to be diverted from its record setting ways and share prices
registered a fifth consecutive closing high. The SMI index added 15.4 to
2,586.4, supported by the firm dollar, lower money market rates and
technical trade connected with the expiry of options and futures today.
Sandoz registered shares added SFr30 to SFr3,300 with its nine months
figures proving in line with expectations.
Ciba-Geigy registered shares shed SFr8 to SFr710 in continued response to
Wednesday's warning that full year profits would be higher but the rise
would be limited by economic conditions.
Nestle was actively traded, rising SFr23 to SFr1,142 on futures related
buying by foreign investors.
Surveillance, the quality control group added SFr45 to SFr1,840 ahead of an
extraordinary shareholders meeting today which will decide on a share
capital cut.
FRANKFURT fell for the second time this week below the 2,000 level in
trading that was largely dominated by the expiration of futures and options
today.
The DAX index ended down 11.44 at 1,990.07 in turnover down to DM7.4bn from
DM8.5bn.
In a declining market Schering was one of the day's exceptions as investors
continued to flock to the stock on news earlier this week that it intended
to increase production of its drug used in the treatment of multiple
sclerosis. The shares put on DM44 or 4 per cent to DM1,113.
Allianz slipped DM27 or 1 per cent to DM2,680. Merrill Lynch has recommended
a switch out of Allianz into Munich Re, down yesterday DM30 to DM3,420, on
the basis that, by comparison, the latter is undervalued at present. Merrill
commented that Munich Re, as the largest pure European insurer, should
benefit the most from an improvement in prospects for the reinsurance
industry.
PARIS reflected disappointment that interest rates had been left unchanged,
given expectation on Wednesday that a cut was imminent. The decision may
also have prompted further speculation against the franc, while Mr George
Soros, in an interview with a German magazine, argued that the French
authorities should cut short term rates drastically to motivate the economy.
The CAC-40 index closed down 13.40 at 2,113.88 in turnover of some FFr3bn.
Kleinwort Benson in its latest monthly review of the market maintains an
overweight position on the assumption that interest rate cuts will come in
the near term. Lowering their target for short term rates to 6 per cent by
the end of the year from 4 per cent previously, they comment that given that
France has underperformed both Germany and Europe recently a correction
seems overdue.
BSN lost FFr16 to FFr854 in reaction to its announcement that it will launch
a new promotional campaign tomorrow which is aimed at reducing its loss of
market share. Some commentators noted that the cost of the campaign is
likely to outweigh immediate benefits.
MADRID put in a firm performance as the Bank of Spain took advantage of this
week's good underlying inflation figures and the stability of the peseta to
cut its key money rate to 9.5 per cent from 10 per cent.
The general index rose 1.88 to 296.83 with some of the best performances
seen in the recently underperforming utilities sector.
BRUSSELS rose on expectations that interest rates might be cut as the local
currency again came under pressure. The Bel-20 index added 14.26 to 1,362.71
in turnover of BFr2.2bn. Among the day's main leaders, Solvay rose 5.3 per
cent to BFr13,400 but off the day's high of BFr13,700.
AMSTERDAM continued to build on Unilever which has been gaining ground
recently on news that branded goods groups are maintaining market share in
the US. The shares closed up a further Fl 4.10 to Fl 207.90 as the CBS
Tendency index put on 0.6 to 129.4. Philips added 60 cents to Fl 36.60 on
news that it was to cut output of televisions.
MILAN marked time as investors closed positions on the last day of the
October trading account and prepared for the forthcoming flurry of rights
issues beginning with Fiat's issue today. The Comit index rose 0.61 to
568.64.
Fiat shed L87 to L5,623 while Italmobiliare, which is also seeking capital,
shed L960 or 2.7 per cent to L34,560.
A technical recovery was seen in the ordinary stocks of a number of
privatisation candidates that have been marked down this week as investors
switched into savings shares.
Credito Italiano rose L27 to L2,233 while BCI finished L19 ahead at L4,369.
Sip, the domestic telephone operator, edged up L32 to L3,445 the holding
company, Stet put on L30 to L3,870.

FT  15 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: Autumn lull in European turnover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last summer's boost to bourse turnover, as traders and investors ignored the
traditional European holiday season, was replaced by an autumn lull in
September; but the hiatus was temporary, and more apparent than real.
September turnover figures for the top eight European bourses, put together
by NatWest Securities, fell by 10.1 per cent from the August level after
previous month-by-month gains of 20.3, 20.8, and 4.4 per cent.
However, says Mr James Cornish, European market strategist at NatWest, this
leaves September well ahead of the 1993 average, and there are other
indications that the setback was not serious:
first, turnover on Seaq International, London's screen-based trading system
for international equities, fell by 15.7 per cent on the month for the seven
continental markets, suggesting a relative reluctance to sell on the part of
international investors; and
secondly, since the military success of the Russian president, Mr Boris
Yeltsin on October 4, European markets have recovered and volumes have
picked up.
The general lesson of the fall of turnover figures in September and their
subsequent rise, says Mr Cornish, seems to be that there has been no
international rush to sell, and that there is still considerable interest in
buying.
There were winners on the month, where doing business was concerned.
Belgium's equity market fell by 1.3 per cent in September, but turnover rose
by 34.8 per cent to a figure well above even the recent record level in
March.
Mr Sebastian Scotney, at Dillon Read, says that investors picked out Belgium
as a 1993 laggard market at the end of September. There was also speculation
that, at some stage, there could be a unilateral devaluation of the Belgian
franc.
Among individual stocks and sectors, there was some quite heavy turnover in
retailers, and Delhaize in particular; while disappointing interim reports
from cyclicals, including Bekhaert, provoked considerable selling from
disappointed existing holders and reciprocal buying from those who believe
that cyclicals are ready to be bought for European economic recovery.
The other winner was France which, in spite of a 4.6 per cent fall in the
CAC-40 index, saw its turnover up 4.2 per cent on August, and by 14.6 per
cent on the average of the previous three months. Mr Cornish says that the
imminence of the BNP privatisation encouraged the market; presumably some
institutions sold to make space for the new scrip which was coming up.
Of the fallers, the Netherlands was down by a fifth as interest turned to
bigger markets, or those with more volatile currencies. The Swiss dropped
19.2 per cent on the suggestion that this bull market had run its course,
and Germany by 18.4 per cent before the beginnings of an October upturn.

<TEXT>
SHARE PRICES initially slipped below the 20,000 level but later recouped
losses on buying by arbitrageurs and public funds, and the Nikkei index
finally closed marginally higher, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225 issue index rose 44.41 to 20,082.81, having fallen to the day's low
of 19,911.89 in the morning session on mounting pessimism over the economic
outlook. However afternoon buying by public funds, arbitrageurs, and bargain
hunting by institutional investors supported shares, and the index hit the
day's high of 20,096.91 just before the close.
Volume was 260m shares against 233m. Declines led advances by 581 to 417,
with 167 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section
stocks fell 0.32 to 1,645.21 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose
1.46 to 1,276.
A spate of weak interim profit announcements from leading retailers
highlighted sluggish consumer demand. Reports of low winter bonus payments
due to poor corporate profits also depressed sentiment.
Janome Sewing Machine, a speculative favourite during the late 1980s, rose
Y24 to Y359 on active trading by foreign investors.
Daiwa Securities, which revised up its profit forecast because of better
than expected bond trading results, rose Y10 to Y1,390. Yamaichi Securities
gained Y17 to Y800 but Nomura Securities, the industry leader, lost Y10 to
Y1,980.
Marubeni, which was sold before an announcement of a Y23bn special loss on
Wednesday, rose Y18 to Y520 on bargain hunting. The company said that it
will offset the loss with extraordinary profits by sales of long-term stock

FT  15 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange: ERM pressures increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE on the European exchange rate mechanism built up yesterday as
financial markets scented blood and hit the French and Belgian francs,
writes Peter John.
Anger by speculators at the refusal by the former core currencies of the ERM
to cut their interest rates was intensified by a half-point easing from the
Bank of Spain. There was also an easier tone in Denmark where some rates
were brought down to the 8.5 per cent level of the seven-day CD which was
set on Monday.
The Belgian National Bank had elicited the help of the US Federal Reserve
during overnight dealing and dealers said the Fed bought between DM10m and
DM15m before Europe opened.
Nevertheless the Belgian currency slipped below BFr22 against the German
currency soon after European markets opened and the Belgian National Bank
was forced to intervene sporadically throughout the day.
The market remains convinced that short-term rates of around 10 per cent are
unsustainably high for a country that has inflation of only 2.8 per cent.
Mr Adrian Cunningham, an economist at UBS said: 'The view in the market
seems to be that the Belgians are not going to be able to sustain the BFr22
level through intervening without also using the weapon of higher interest
rates.'
The sell-off spilled over into the French franc which reached lows unseen
since shortly after the August ERM crisis which forced a widening of
currency fluctuation bands to 15 per cent.
The French currency tumbled to FFr3.5425 against the D-Mark in intraday
trading. That was just down from its lowest point for more than 12 months -
FFr3.5422 - which was reached on August 16. It recovered in late trading to
close at FFr3.5300, down from FFr3.5290 previously. However, there was
little sense of relief. One trader said: 'Today's moves are consistent with
the gradual weakening of the former ERM core members.'
The Bank of Spain's decision to reduce its key money rate by half a
percentage point to 9.5 per cent helped the Spanish peseta even though a
rate cut would normally tend to weaken a currency. The Spanish currency
closed at Pta80.96 against the D-Mark, stronger than Pta81.29 previously.
The US dollar picked up smartly on the knock-on effect of a big trade in
Australian dollars and Japanese Yen. One investor sold Yen very heavily to
buy Australian dollars. This was followed by active dealing in the cross and
the subsequent weakness of the yen saw it fall to Y107.45 against the US
currency, down from Y106 previously.
That boost for the dollar helped it to pick up against the D-Mark and pound.
It closed up at DM1.6140 against DM1.6035 and at Dollars 1.5130 to the pound
against Dollars 1.5225.
Sterling was dull in spite of relatively encouraging news on employment.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Money Markets: Interest rate falls seen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BELIEF that interest rates would fall in the UK was maintained yesterday, in
spite of a moderate drop in unemployment, while lower Spanish rates gave
hope that a trend of easier money might be emerging in Europe, writes Peter
John.
Short sterling futures were higher in the morning on the belief that there
might be an increase in the number of unemployed during September. A rise
would have underlined the weakness in the economy and reinforced the need
for lower rates.
When the seasonally adjusted figure came in with a drop of 13,600 in the
jobless total, the sterling futures contract for December fell initially.
From a high of 94.51 it hit a low of 94.44.
However, the sell-off was short-lived as economists took a harder look at
the figures and decided they were less encouraging than first thought.
Also, the decision by the Bank of Spain to cut its key lending rate by half
a percentage point to 9.5 per cent gave some hope that, in spite of the
hard-line approach by the central banks of Belgium and France in recent
days, European rates may be about to fall further. Lower rates in
continental Europe would give a greater margin for easier lending conditions
in the UK.
In the event, short sterling was steady at 94.47 at the end of dealing and
drifted down a couple of basis points during unofficial trading. Meanwhile
short-term money rates were around  1/16 per cent lower although
marketmakers said the easier money was merely responding to Wednesday's
rally in the futures market.
Certainly, short rates were under no pressure from interbank dealing
yesterday. An early forecast shortage of Pounds 1.5bn was almost all taken
out at the start of Bank of England operations.
The Bank bought Pounds 1.25bn of bills at 5 29/32 per cent for resale on
November 3 and 4. It also bought a further Pounds 125m of bills. At midday,
the shortage was revised to Pounds 1.6bn and the Bank of England bought an
additional Pounds 230m of bills taking assistance to just over Pounds 1.6bn.
German call money was quoted at 6.7 per cent down from 6.8 on Wednesday,
following the generous allocation of funds in this week's repo tender. The
fall in the overnight rate prompted some dealers to look for a 5-basis point
cut in next weeks repurchase agreement rate.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: New Zealand forests threatened
with gypsy moth bombardment
</HEADLINE>

   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A MAJOR hunt is under way for the feared Asian gypsy moth in New Zealand
amid fears that it could devastate the country's native and exotic forests,
one of the country's biggest export earners.
The search follows the discovery of clusters of moth eggs on a ship from
China and the Russian Far East.
The Forestry Ministry says that the moth would devastate New Zealand's
forests, exports of which earn the country NZDollars 2.3bn a year and are
forecast to grow rapidly with vast areas of farmland being planted with
pinus radiata at present.
The gypsy moth has already appeared the US and Canada, forcing the
authorities to undertake costly measures eradication measures, such as
aerial spraying of forests. Vancouver city was recently sprayed at the cost
of NZDollars 8m.
The ship was not allowed to berth in New Zealand and sent back fully laden
to Asia. This is the latest in a series of vessels found to be carrying the
moths' eggs.
Forestry Ministry official Mr John Handiside believes that the moths may
have already established themselves in New Zealand, as until recently
quarantine officials, in the belief the larvae died in the tropical heat on
the way from Russia to New Zealand, had not searched for the moth larvae.
New information from North America had shattered that belief.
Mr Handiside said that the real problem was the moth's caterpillar stage.
'The moths can build up biblical storms of millions and strip forests of
their leaves,' he said, adding that their mere presence in New Zealand would
pose a threat to timber exports as other countries would be unwilling to
risk importing infected timber.

producer

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF Russia's largest oil companies is to be partially sold off in one of
the largest privatisations to date in the Russian energy sector, it emerged
yesterday.
Yuganskneftegaz, an oil production company, which manages fields in Western
Siberia and claims to be one of the largest oil companies in the world, will
sell about 12 per cent of its shares in auctions, scheduled to start on
October 25.
In keeping with Russia's privatisation schemes, the shares will be not be
sold for cash, but privatisation vouchers.
Since foreigners are legally permitted to deal in these vouchers, however,
the sale marks one of the first opportunities for foreign investors to buy
shares in a Russian oil company in a privatisation drive that started when
another Russian oil company, Komineft, was partially privatised three months
ago.
But although the privatisation is seen as a step towards badly needed reform
of Russia's energy sector, western oil groups yesterday expressed doubts
that there would be many foreign buyers yet.
'I think it's premature to be talking about buying shares in a Russian oil
company at the moment. Most Western (oil) companies here are trying to do
joint deals,' commented one western oil executive in Moscow.
Like most of Russia's troubled oil sector, Yuganskneftegaz has seen its
output fall dramatically in the past two years, by 60 per cent to some 31.6m
tonnes, according to Mr Pavel Fyodorov, deputy director.
However, the company signed a joint venture deal three weeks ago with Amoco,
the American oil company, to develop the Priobskoye oil field, which
contains up to 5bn barrels of recoverable oil, according to executives at
Amoco's headquarters in Houston. The limited quantity of shares on offer
reflects, however, the lingering political opposition in Russia to the
privatisation of large enterprises, particularly in key sectors such as oil.
The Russian government plans to retain about one-third of the shares in the
company, while the rest of the shares will be sold to workers, managers and
local residents.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mobil returns to Vietnam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAIN SIMPSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HO CHI MINH CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HISTORY TURNED full circle in Ho Chi Minh City yesterday when Mobil Oil
executives arrived to take part in a trade show in the city. They were
greeted with open arms by Vietnamese officials who believe that after an
absence of nearly two decades, their arrival shows Mobil's eagerness to get
back into Vietnam.
The last time Mobil executives were in this city, it was called Saigon and
it was the capital of South Vietnam. That was in January 1975, when Mobil
became the first company to find oil off the coast. Three months later,
however, North Vietnamese tanks rolled into Saigon and Mobil got out.
After the war Vietnam set up a joint venture with the Soviet Union to
exploit the oil that Mobil had discovered and Soviet technology has been
pumping out Vietnamese oil ever since.
Now, a team from Mobil is back in Vietnam, led by regional Vice President Mr
Bob Aberbach. This week they are exhibiting the company's wares at
PetroVietnam 93 and Mobil has already bid for a production-sharing contract
on the Dragon field, which will soon be awarded by the state oil and gas
corporation.
The US trade embargo against Vietnam still prevents American companies from
doing most kinds of business in the country, but under the recently relaxed
rules of the embargo, American oil companies can go a long way towards
exploring potential fields.
'We can sign production-sharing contracts, carry out exploration drilling
and appraisal drilling, which is the first stage in any production-sharing
programme,' Mr Aberbach said. He added that this process could take anything
from two to five years.
Mobil hopes its past ties with Vietnam will give the company an edge in
trying to secure part of the Dragon field and Mr Aberbach admits Mobil has a
historical soft spot for Vietnam.
Many of his colleagues from other companies believe, however, that the
potential for oil production in Vietnam has been greatly exaggerated.
They say that unless more evidence emerges soon of major reserves, it is
unlikely that Vietnam will ever fulfil its much-hyped promise. One executive
even suggested that Vietnamese officials might have falsified some of the
evidence they produced to inflate the apparent potential of the country's
fields.

The London COFFEE changed direction in the afternoon, heading higher as news
began to filter through that Brazil was putting the finishing touches to its
retention arrangements. The January quotation closed at Dollars 1,192 a
tonne, up Dollars 15 on the day. The president of the Federation of
Brazilian Coffee Exporters later said Brazil would start buying coffee next
week, pushing New York prices even higher, but that was after London's
close. COCOA prices headed lower as the market seemed to lose heart and
braced itself for another move back towards the Pounds 900-a-tonne support
area for the March 1994 futures contract. The price dipped to Pounds 930 a
tonne before closing at Pounds 935, down Pounds 10 on the day. At the London
Metal Exchange aluminium prices were firmer on producer support and
short-covering purchases. The three months position closed at Dollars
1,128.25 a tonne, up Dollars 10.50. ZINC prices edged back following
Wednesday's strong advance as the market continued to await confirmation or
rumoured European production cuts. The GOLD and SILVER markets were weaker
after Wednesday's jumps, but PLATINUM was up again.

NORWAY'S CRUDE oil production is expected to surge by 11 per cent in 1994 to
a daily average output of 2.4m barrels, compared with a projected 3 per cent
rise in 1993 to 2.2m barrels a day, according to industry and energy
ministry forecasts in the 1994 budget, which was unveiled this week.
The state's direct share of production is forecast to increase to about
750,000 b/d from 660,000 b/d in 1993.
Gas sales, according to the ministry, will rise by some 2bn cubic metres to
28bn cu m in 1994.
The rise in crude oil production will be derived principally from five new
fields coming on stream, including Sleipner East, Gullfaks West, Tordis and
Statfjord East and North satellites. In addition, production from the
Draugen, Brage and Snorre fields will rise after their first full year of
production.
The ministry said that it expected the value of oil and gas exports in 1994
to expand to NKr114bn (Pounds 10,65bn), based on an oil price of NKr120 a
barrel, from NKr105bn this year. It based the oil price on an exchange rate
of NKr7.10 to the US dollar and a world oil price of USDollars 17 a barrel -
within a few cents of the current price on the European spot market -
officials disclosed.
Norway never officially reveals the dollar exchange rate on which it bases
its domestic currency price per barrel of oil.
Investments in petroleum activity will be reduced next year to an estimated
NKr58bn from NKr62bn in 1993, including exploration costs. Of the total
investment, the state will spend about Nkr24.8bn in 1994, mostly unchanged
from 1993.
In 1993 the Norwegian state ran a deficit of NKr2.9bn on its direct
involvement in petroleum activities as investments exceeded income. But it
forecast that these activities would yield a positive cash flow of NKr350m
in 1994.
The country's total income from the petroleum sector was likely to rise to
about NKr26.2bn in 1994 from NKr25.1bn this year, the ministry estimated.
Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, will see its dividend payment to
the state fall in 1994 to NKr900m from NKr1.2bn this year.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Warm reception for Chile mine
deal - David Pilling talks to the successful bidder for the giant El Abra
copper project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS with a feeling of 'great joy' that Mr Felipe Anguita, general manager
of the Chilean subsidiary of Cyprus Minerals Company, read a fax explaining
that his bid for the largest copper mine on sale in the world had been
successful.
The fax came from Codelco, Chile's state-owned copper company. It included a
list of the nine consortia that had bid for the huge El Abra mine: Mr
Anguita's was at the top.
After a lengthy and fierce bidding process, the US-Canadian consortium of
Cyprus and Lac Minerals had seen off some of the world's biggest mining
concerns. 'I was elated at the possibility of developing, alongside Codelco,
one of the premier mines of the decade,' says Mr Anguita.
Codelco officials were elated too, for the bid had been a generous one. In
return for 51 per cent of El Abra, the Cyprus/Lac consortium agreed to pay
Dollars 404m on signing the contract, expected this December, plus up to a
further Dollars 151m representing Codelco's equity stake in the joint
venture.
In addition, the consortium intends to invest about Dollars 1bn in
developing El Abra, a sum that is to comprise 30 per cent equity and 70 per
cent borrowing. Cyprus/Lac has guaranteed to secure Dollars 700m in
financing, a package it expects to be complete by early 1995.
The Cyprus/Lac proposal estimates initial production at El Abra, perched
high in the Andes in Chile's Atacama desert, of 225,000 tonnes of copper
cathodes annually for 20 years - far more than Codelco's original estimate
of 120,000 tonnes.
'Codelco always said there was upside potential,' says Mr Anguita. 'Our
studies indicate that there are additional oxide reserves, allowing us to
develop a project practically double the one originally envisioned.'
Production costs are expected to be in the region of 40 to 45 US cents a lb,
against a current Codelco average of 69 cents. The oxide reserves  - of 0.7
per cent grade - lie close to the surface. This 'coupled with the technical
advances of the past few years relating to solvent extraction and
electrowinning makes for low operating costs,' says Mr Anguita.
He strongly denies that the consortium paid too much for the deposit, in
spite of Codelco admissions that the Cyprus/Lac bid beat the second-placed
offer from BHP Minerals/Magma Copper Company by 'an important margin'.
'We've been building a strategy from day one to come up with what we felt
was the true value of the property. We arrived at our estimate after
exhaustive studies,' says Mr Anguita. Cyprus, whose existing mines are not
all of the highest ore grade, determined not to be outbid.
In August, Cyprus realised the project was too big to handle alone and
proposed teaming up with Lac. 'Due to the fact that the project had gotten
so large and the financial commitments so great, Cyprus looked at the
alternative of having a partner.'
Lac, better known as a gold producer, was chosen 'for its strong technical
and financial capabilities'. Lac is already well represented in Chile,
operating El Indio gold mine and the zinc mine at El Toqui.
After El Abra begins production, due in April 1997, Mr Anguita predicts that
output will gradually rise, reaching an annual 320,000-330,000 tonnes of
cathodes by the 11th year. It should be able to maintain this for 'eight to
nine years'.
There are plans to exploit El Abra's huge sulphide reserves, also starting
from the 11th year of production. Eventually, the mine could be producing
about 200,000 tonnes of concentrate (with purity of around 30 per cent), a
two-stage expansion that would require further investment of Dollars
700m-Dollars 800m.
Mr Anguita stresses that development of sulphides would be 'contingent upon
the economic conditions' and that the consortium's only commitment is to
exploit the oxide cap. In the event that non-leachable sulphides are
exploited, the consortium will pay Codelco a further 5 per cent royalty on
pre-tax profits.
The El Abra deal, the first Codelco joint venture to be concluded under
legislation passed last year, is being viewed as a great leap forward for
the state-owned company, which has - until now - failed to develop a new
mine throughout its 20-year history.
Before the winning bid was announced, Mr Alejandro Foxley, Chile's finance
minister, was glowing in his assessment of the joint venture. 'Codelco will
not have to spend a single dollar or pound on the new venture and yet it
will be a partner and carry a right to a share in the profits. That's not a
bad proposition,' he said.
The success of the El Abra negotiations is likely to put further pressure on
legislators to change the rules regarding Radomiro Tomic, another world
class Codelco mine which, because it is considered a 'replacement' deposit,
is excluded from joint venture status. The project is currently postponed
owing to finance ministry reluctance to release development funds.
'The El Abra result sheds new light on Radomiro Tomic,' says Mr Jorge Bande,
Codelco's vice-president for development. 'It really makes one think that it
might be more convenient to take on other projects under this (joint
venture) scheme.'
None of this debate is of immediate interest to Mr Anguita, who is already
wrapped up in detailed joint venture discussions with Codelco. Cyprus,
although a 50-50 partner with Lac, is responsible for day-to-day
negotiations and will play a lead role in operating El Abra.
Construction of mine infrastructure is due to start as early as January
1995, but all that seems a long way off. 'I feel like I'm in the middle of a
hurricane,' says Mr Anguita. 'It's going to be a pretty busy few months.'

FT  15 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zimbabwe 'to rival SA platinum
output'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ZIMBABWE'S PLATINUM mining industry will grow in the next ten to 15 years to
rival output by South Africa, the world's biggest producer, predicts Mr
Peter Vanderspuy, chairman of Delta Gold, an Australian group.
Three of the world's biggest mining groups, Anglo American Corporation of
South Africa, Broken Hill Proprietary (BHP) of Australia and the UK-based
RTZ Corporation, as well as Delta, are in talks about pooling their
interests on the so-called Great Dyke in Zimbabwe. This is geologically
similar to the Bushveld Complex of South Africa, the world's largest
repository of platinum group metals.
The fastest-growing use for platinum is for car anti-pollution catalysts. Mr
Vanderspuy suggests that the big consumers, particularly the US car
manufacturers, would welcome a second major source apart from South Africa,
which at present accounts for 72 per cent of supply.
'The Great Dyke area has the potential to support operations producing up to
600,000 (troy) ounces of platinum a year, with a reserve life in excess of
50 years,' says Mr Vanderspuy. 'However, development to this size would
necessarily be staged over a ten- to 15-year period.'
BHP has an option to earn a 67 per cent interest in Delta's Hartley joint
venture by completing a feasibility study and committing itself to develop
and finance a platinum mine.
RTZ and Anglo American subsidiaries each own 38 per cent of the nearby
Mhondoro platinum joint venture, with Delta having the remaining 24 per
cent.
Mr Vanderspuy says that, whatever the outcome of the four-sided discussions,
the Hartley project will not be delayed. A recently-completed feasibility
study shows mining of the Hartley, using conventional, 'narrow reef'
underground mining methods practised in South Africa, is technically and
economically viable.
Metal can be recovered economically, even at today's depressed prices, by
conventional processing methods. He claims production costs will be lower
than those of every South African producer apart from the new PPRust mine.
Hartley is forecast to cost USDollars 200m, which includes a base-metals
refinery and infrastructure to be built by the joint venturers. Construction
should begin early next year with full production in mid-1996. The planned
initial annual production rate is 150,000 ounces of platinum, 110,000 ounces
of palladium, 11,500 ounces of rhodium, 23,000 ounces of gold, 7m lb of
copper and 5m lb of nickel.
Hartley would represent less than 3 per cent of present world annual
platinum output, so would not depend on unusual demand growth to find
markets, Mr Vanderspuy suggests. Hartley alone will increase output to
300,000 ounces a year in stages, at which point a platinum refinery will be
built at the mine site. However, if Delta's three partners agreed to pool
operations, output would reach 600,000 ounces.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Government Bonds: Cut in Spanish money rate helps lift
Iberian sectors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IBERIAN markets were lifted by the Spanish rate cut and news that Portugal
plans to scrap its withholding tax for non-residents, as most European core
bond markets put on a lacklustre performance.
The Spanish central bank cut its key money rate by  1/2 point to 9.5 per
cent. This pushed the December bond future on the Spanish futures exchange
up 0.51 point to 101.91.
After Wednesday's rally, the Portuguese 10-year benchmark jumped another
point to yield 9.03 per cent, down 42 basis points in the last two days.
Traders reported heavy foreign buying of Portuguese bonds following the tax
news and while some felt the rally had gone far enough, others said it could
well go further.
UK gilts traded in a jagged pattern, falling at the open, recovering during
the day and closing lower. The long gilt contract eased  15/32 to 113.
The erratic trading pattern appeared to reflect investors' uncertainty over
recent inflation and economic data.
'There is mild bearishness, but no outright conviction,' said Mr Ifty Islam,
bond strategist at Merrill Lynch. However, the near-term bias was still
downwards, he said.
The Bank of England is set today to announce the next gilts auction and most
participants expect a new five-year benchmark.
Some said it may be smaller than the recent Pounds 3bn-Pounds 3.25bn issues,
given that the Treasury is well ahead of its funding schedule. But others
said a new 1999 benchmark might require substantial liquidity.
FRENCH bonds slipped after the central bank left its intervention rate
unchanged at its latest open-market operation. Nevertheless, rate-cut hopes
remain alive.
'They wouldn't let call money ease like this if it wasn't going to happen
near-term,' said Ms Marie Owens Thomsen, international economist with
Midland Global Markets. Call money trades at 7 per cent, the lowest it has
been in seven years.
French easing is expected to be kicked off by a drop in the German repo
rate. Once the easing process resumes, Ms Owens Thomsen expects to see funds
shifting back into shorter maturities, causing French and German yield
curves to steepen and pushing their 10-year yields back above 6 per cent.
BELGIAN bonds jumped on foreign buying spurred by hopes for near-term
easing. The 10-year yield premium over bunds narrowed to 124 basis points
from 131.
GERMAN bonds ended little changed, with the December Bund future closing at
99.97 down 0.05 point on the day. As French and Belgian francs came under
increased pressure traders reported some safe-haven buying of bunds, but
flows were modest.
GOOD news on inflation sent US Treasury prices soaring at the long end of
the bond market yesterday.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  7/8 at 105
17/32 , yielding 5.851 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was up  1/16 at 100 5/32 , to yield 3.774 per cent.
Buyers moved into the market as soon as the Labor department reported that
its producer prices index rose 0.2 per cent in September, slightly below the
0.3 per cent analysts had been expecting. Meanwhile, the core measure of
producer prices (which excludes the volatile food and energy components) was
unchanged last month.
The numbers underlined what the market knew - that inflation was not a
threat to fixed-income investors at the moment - but the weak core PPI
figure proved enough to push longer-dated prices sharply higher.

FT  15 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: Mexican groups plan US
listings

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR more Mexican comp-anies are planning to issue equity on the New York
Stock Exchange this year, as the corporate sector continues to tap
international markets.
The four are Grupo Financiero Serfin, the third largest financial group;
Grupo Televisa, the big media company; Gemex, the Pepsi-Cola bottler; and
Bufete Industrial, a leading industrial construction group.
The four issues will bring the number of Mexican companies listed on the
NYSE to 12. In the first eight months of 1993, Mexican companies issued
Dollars 1.07bn in new equity.
Grupo Televisa will offer about 5 per cent of its capital in a Dollars 375m
equity offering on the NYSE. The issue will be lead managed by Goldman
Sachs. Televisa's ADRs are traded in New York on the private 144a market.
Grupo Financiero Serfin, the financial group that owns Banca Serfin, is
expected to sell between Dollars 150m and Dollars 200m of equity in the US.
It will be the first Mexican financial group to be listed on the NYSE. The
offer will be managed by First Boston.
Banca Serfin made profits of Dollars 155m in the first half, and has assets
of Dollars 21bn. It has total assets of about 77bn new pesos. The bank was
privatised with a wave of other banks in 1992. At the time, industrialist Mr
Adrian Sada Gonzalez paid about Dollars 940m for a 51 per cent stake.
Serfin will offer shares to local investors through the Mexican stock
exchange. Serfin's brokerage Operadora de Bolsa Serfin, will lead that
tranche, the sources said.
Bufete Industrial, a leading industrial engineering company which has a
joint venture with Kellogg, the US company, plans to launch an initial
public offering on the NYSE and Mexican stock exchange for about Dollars
110m. The offering will be lead managed by Goldman Sachs.
Gemex, the Pepsi-Cola franchise holder for Mexico City, Acapulco and the
Yucatan, will place 20 per cent of its capital in the NYSE in December for
between Dollars 300m and Dollars 400m, according to Enrique Molina, the
chief executive. This offering is expected to be managed by Goldman Sachs.

FT  15 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: Japan investors 'more aware
of credit risk'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A GROWING reluctance among Japanese banks to guarantee bond defaults is
prompting a greater awareness of credit risk among Japanese institutional
investors, according to Moody's Investors Services, the US credit rating
agency.
Japanese banks are required by law to act as trustees to bond issues,
providing cover in the event of default losses. As a result, issuer credit
risk has rarely been reflected in Japanese bond yields.
Banks have absorbed the risks of bankruptcy by an issuer. They have repaid
the bond holder in full and then sold the collateral on the bonds to cover
their costs.
However, faced with deteriorating balance sheets, Japanese banks are
increasingly reluctant to take on such risks, says Moody's.
If an issuer were to go bankrupt, investors can no longer expect immediate
repayment from banks in full face value of the debt. Banks are now more
likely first to dispose of an issue's collateral before reimbursing
bondholders.
Moody's says the recent easing of restrictions on issues of uncollateralised
bonds poses additional risk for investors.
As Japanese investors become more aware of such changes, they will include
credit risks of the corporate issuers among their investment criteria. 'A
clearer risk-return relationship could soon become reality within the
Japanese corporate bond market.'

FT  15 OCT 93 / International Bonds: EC launches long-awaited DM1bn Eurobond
issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community launched its long-awaited DM1bn Eurobond offering
yesterday, capitalising on Wednesday's favourable reception to its Ecu1bn
Eurobond issue.
The EC decided to launch the five-year D-Mark bonds quickly so as not to
clash with the World Bank's planned DM3bn global offering.
The World Bank's deal is expected to come early next week, ahead of the
Bundesbank's meeting.
The market was surprised that the EC only borrowed DM1bn, half the amount
which had been rumoured.
The EC is currently funding the second Ecu2bn tranche of its Ecu8bn lending
programme to Italy.
Mr Paul Goldschmidt, director at the EC's credit and investment division
reporting to EC economics commissioner Mr Henning Christophersen, said Italy
had not wanted to borrow more than DM1bn at this time. The other DM900m
would be raised at a later date, he said.
The pricing of the bonds, to yield eight basis points over the series 107 of
German government medium-term notes, came within expectations. When the
bonds were freed to trade, the spread narrowed slightly.
The other large deal of the day was a Dollars 1bn FRN offering from LKB
Baden Wurttemberg.
The pricing of the five-year notes, which yielded 11 basis points below the
six-month London interbank offered rate (Libor), was seen by some to be on
the tight side.
However, lead manager CSFB said the pricing reflected the issuer's triple-A
rating and its close links with the state of Baden Wurttemberg. The deal,
which provided fresh liquidity to the market, attracted investors who were
looking for defensive instruments. The notes traded around their fixed
re-offer price of 99.95 in the afternoon.
Instituto Nacional de Industria (Ini), the Spanish state industrial holding
company, today signs its Dollars 1bn Euro medium-term note programme. It
plans to make its first Eurobond offering, of Dollars 500m, under this
programme towards the end of November.
Urban Mortgage Bank of Sweden plans to raise Dollars 500m in the Euromarket
next week. Nomura is thought to be arranging the deal.
Elsewhere, ABN Amro, the largest bank in the Netherlands, opened up the
100-year maturity in the US domestic bond market to European borrowers with
its Dollars 150m offering of subordinated deposit notes due 2093.
Lead manager Morgan Stanley said the bonds were priced to yield 110 basis
points over the 7 1/8 per cent US Treasury due 2023.
This compared with yield spreads of 75 basis points and 67 basis points on
similar deals launched by Walt Disney and Coca-Cola, respectively, earlier
this year.
ABN's 100-year bonds, which yielded 25 basis points over its its 30-year
bonds, were bought by about 20 US institutional investors.

price cuts

<TEXT>
NISSAN and Mazda, the lossmaking Japanese carmakers, are seeking another
round of price cuts from their components suppliers.
Nissan said it had asked about 50 of its suppliers to reduce their prices -
its second such move this year.
In February, the carmaker sought reductions from 32 of its affiliated
suppliers.
It had been forced to seek further price cuts by the prolonged downturn in
the Japanese market and the sharp rise in the value of the yen, it said.
Nissan had forecast a recovery in new vehicle demand in the second half, but
it now believes that there is unlikely to be any improvement before 1994.
Mazda said that it had asked its components suppliers to reduce prices by at
least 3 per cent.
Honda asked its suppliers to reduce prices by 2 per cent earlier in the
year.
Japanese vehicle makers are squeezing their suppliers under the impact of
one of the worst downturns the industry has experienced. New vehicle sales
are expected to fall in 1993 for the third year in succession.
Similar pressures are being exerted elsewhere, particularly in western
Europe and North America.

CHINA'S largest steelmaker, Anshan Iron and Steel Complex (Angang), has
signed a joint venture agreement with Perth-based Portman Mining to develop
an iron ore mine at Koolyanobbing in Western Australia, writes Nikki Tait.
Koolyanobbing was closed by Broken Hill Proprietary in 1982, but the aim is
to redevelop the mine by July next year. Angang will buy all iron ore fines
produced at Koolyanobbing - estimated to average around 1.1m tonnes a year -
for the next 20 years.
The joint venture will take over low-grade stockpiles left behind when BHP
closed its iron ore operations on Cockatoo Island, off northern Western
Australia. Angang will also buy the concentrate from Cockatoo Island for the
six years of this project.

FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: Sun Micro hits peak with Dollars
16.6m in first quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUN Microsystems reported record first-quarter revenues but the computer
workstation manufacturer failed to live up to earnings expectations.
Net earnings for the quarter were Dollars 16.6m, or 16 cents a share,
including a credit of about Dollars 6m from tax changes.
This compares with net income of Dollars 4.8m, or 5 cents in the same period
last year.
Wall Street analysts had been projecting income of about 26 cents per share.
Revenues rose 12 per cent to Dollars 960.5m from Dollars 855.9m in the first
quarter of the last fiscal year.
Strong growth in the US market as well as reduced costs helped to mitigate
continued weakness in several European markets, said Mr Kevin Melia, Sun's
chief financial officer. 'For the fourth consecutive quarter we have driven
down our operating expenses as a percentage of revenues compared with the
year-ago period,' said Mr Melia.
'For the second consecutive quarter this decrease in expenses more than
offset the expected decline in the gross margin percentage, and enabled us
to again grow operating income faster than revenues,' he said.
Earlier this week, top executives at Sun took a self-imposed pay cut of
about 30 per cent, saying that their compensation should be more closely
linked to the company's performance through stock options.
Sun's results were issued after the close of trading yesterday.
On Wall Street, Sun shares closed at Dollars 23, up from Wednesday's Dollars
21 5/8.

<TEXT>
APPLE Computer reported a small profit for its fourth quarter as gross
margins on its personal computer products slid from more than 40 per cent to
about 26 per cent amid industry-wide price cutting.
Net income for the quarter was Dollars 2.7m , or 2 cents a share, down from
Dollars 97.6m, or 81 cents, in the same period last year. Revenues for the
quarter were Dollars 2.14bn, the highest level in the company's history and
up 21 per cent from Dollars 1.77bn in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1992.
To compensate for lower gross margins, in its third fiscal quarter Apple
announced a sweeping restructuring. As a result of these changes, fourth
quarter operating expenses were reduced by Dollars 80m or 13 per cent, the
company said.
'We have challenges ahead of us, but I believe we are beginning to turn the
corner,' said Mr Michael Spindler, president and chief executive.
'Our new prices for Macintosh computers . . . led to brisk sales and market
share gains during the quarter.'
For fiscal 1993, Apple's net income was Dollars 86.6m, or 73 cents a share,
down from Dollars 530.4m, or Dollars 4.33 a share, last year. The company
took a pre-tax charge against earnings of Dollars 321m in the third quarter.
Revenues rose to Dollars 7.98bn from Dollars 7.09bn in 1992.

FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: Boral raises bid to win Sagasco

THE battle for control of South Australia's Sagasco Holdings came to an
abrupt end yesterday when Boral, the Australian building materials and
energy company, increased its offer and secured the support of the oil and
gas company's largest shareholder.
The new offer of ADollars 3.90 a share, raised from ADollars 3.50 a share,
values Sagasco at ADollars 846m (USDollars 545.8m), which compares with
ADollars 759m previously.
The South Australian Government Financing Authority, which holds a 31.89 per
cent interest in Sagasco, said it would accept the revised terms.
At the outset of the bid, Boral had acquired a 19.9 per cent interest in its
target - also from the financing authority - for A4146m, or ADollars 3.40 a
share.
As a result, Boral now owns or has acceptances in respect of more than 50.1
per cent of Sagasco's shares. This allowed the bidder to declare its offer
unconditional yesterday morning. The revised bid will now be extended until
October 28.
The quick denouement left Santos, the Adelaide-based oil and gas company
which holds a 19.9 per cent interest in Sagasco, pondering its position.
'Santos has not accepted the offer and is considering its position in the
light of these developments,' it said in a brief statement.
Santos opened the bidding for Sagasco a year ago, with an offer of ADollars
3.70 a share, but ran into opposition from the Trade Practices Commission.
The TPC worried that a takeover of Sagasco - which has oil and gas interests
in South Australia's Cooper Basin as well as interests in south-west
Queensland, Western Australia's Beharra Springs and the Northern Territory's
Amadeus gas projects - would give Santos a virtual monopoly in the South
Australian gas industry.

MITSUKOSHI, an up-market Japanese department store, posted its first interim
pre-tax loss in nine years as an increasing number of consumers turned away
from luxury goods.
The store suffered a non-consolidated pre-tax loss of Y1.7bn (Dollars 16m)
and an after-tax deficit of Y2bn. Sales fell 5.1 per cent to Y398.8bn as
unseasonally cool weather hit sales of clothing and household goods.
Mitsukoshi expects a full-year pre-tax loss of Y2.3bn on a 3.6 per cent fall
in sales to Y812bn.
Among other retailers, Daiei, the country's largest supermarket operator,
saw its pre-tax profit fall 8.4 per cent to Y10.5bn on a 1.2 per cent rise
in sales to Y1,011.7bn. After-tax profit inched up 1.6 per cent to Y4bn.
Daiei reported a special first-half loss of Y5bn due to liquidation of a
subsidiary. The company is trying to cut its debts, officials said. Daiei
expects full-year unconsolidated pre-tax profits to fall 2.3 per cent to
Y2bn on a 1.2 per cent rise in sales to Y2,040bn.
Ito-Yokado, which owns Southland Corp of the US, reported a a 14.8 per cent
fall in interim pre-tax profits to Y41.7bn on a 0.1 per cent rise in sales
to Y750.8bn. The company said profits were hit by the fall in clothing
sales, but the effects of cost-cutting efforts would come through in the
second half. Ito-Yokado expects a 5.1 per cent fall in full-year pre-tax
profits to Y92.5bn, on a 1.9 per cent rise in sales to Y1,540bn.
Seven-Eleven, a convenience store operator and a subsidiary of Ito-Yokado,
said its half-year pre-tax profit rose 2.6 per cent to Y46.2bn. Sales rose
7.5 per cent to Y98.6bn due to the launch of a record 224 stores during the
first half. After-tax profit rose 4.4 per cent to Y25.2bn.
The company expects full-year pre-tax profits to rise 5 per cent to Y89.5bn
on an 8.5 per cent increase in sales to Y197.4bn.

steelmaker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA'S largest steelmaker, Anshan Iron and Steel Complex (Angang), has
signed a joint venture agreement with Perth-based Portman Mining to develop
an iron ore mine at Koolyanobbing in Western Australia.
Koolyanobbing was closed by Broken Hill Proprietary in 1982, but the aim is
to redevelop the mine by July next year. Angang will buy all the iron ore
fines produced at Koolyanobbing - which are estimated to average around 1.1m
tonnes a year - for the next 20 years.
The joint venture will take over low-grade stockpiles left behind when BHP
closed its iron ore operations on Cockatoo Island, off northern Western
Australia. Angang will also buy the concentrate from Cockatoo Island for the
six years of this project.
Total annual sales for the joint venture - including those to Angang - are
forecast to be ADollars 50m (USDollars 33.13m) a year.
Investment in the joint venture project itself will be around ADollars 25m,
although the two parties said that there would be further 'substantial'
expenditure by plant and equipment contractors and by the Esperance Port
Authority on shiploading facilities.
Portman will hold a 60 per cent interest in the joint venture, and Angang
the rest.

FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: Hitachi to increase spending on
advanced memory chips capacity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE semiconductor makers are stepping up investment in next-generation
dynamic random access memory chips in a bid to take advantage of strong
demand for advanced memory chips from the personal computer industry and
stay ahead of rivals in the highly competitive market.
Hitachi yesterday became the latest company to announce it will increase
investment in 16-megabit dRAMs to bring worldwide capacity at its dRAM
factories to about 2m chips a month by the end of next year.
The company produces about 300,000 16-megabit dRAMs a month in Japan, but it
plans to start manufacturing the chips at its German plant next year. It
will invest Y60bn (Dollars 566m) by the end of fiscal 1996.
Hitachi's move follows the earlier decision by NEC to bring a semiconductor
facility on stream to manufacture 16-megabit dRAMS next year. NEC's
facility, which had been built but not equipped, will eventually have the
capacity to manufacture 4m dRAMs per month, the company said.
Meanwhile, Fujitsu, one of Japan's leading semiconductor makers, and
Hyundai, the Korean company, agreed earlier this month to co-operate in the
development of 16-megabit dRAMs. Hitachi also agreed earlier this month to
transfer 16-megabit technology to Goldstar of Korea and buy back chips on an
original equipment manufacturing basis.

FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: Global battle is joined for
Spanish telecoms market - The end of protectionism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE gloves are off in the battle for control of Spanish telecommunications,
a market which, according to Price Waterhouse, is worth around Dollars
7.8bn, or almost 2 per cent of the global telecoms market.
After years of protection from the outside world, the market is being prised
open. The Spanish government is about to award two licences to allow
independent operators to provide data transmission services, and next year
plans to liberalise the cellular telephone business.
Opinions are mixed as to how Telefonica, the state-controlled
telecommunications group chaired by Mr Candido Velazquez, will face up to
the competition. An estimated 31 per cent of its revenues come from
businesses that will shortly be opened up to competition.
British Telecommunications (BT), France Telecom and Cable and Wireless are
seeking data transmission licences. Three domestic consortia, which involve
almost all of Spain's big corporate names, have teamed up with foreign
operators to bid for the mobile telephone business.
Telefonica, in which the government has a 32 per cent shareholding, claims
it can hold on to a market share of at least 75 per cent for deregulated
services and that it faces a possible 4 per cent loss of annual revenues.
It has signed up JP Morgan, the US investment bank, as financial adviser.
Telefonica insiders say the US bank will be the company's key partner as it
seeks strategic international alliances, particularly in Latin American
privatisation processes.
The government is going slow on liberalisation. Like Ireland, Portugal and
Greece, it has ensured that voice transmission and the basic domestic
network (which accounted for 82 per cent of Telefonica's revenues last year)
will not be deregulated until 2003 instead of in 1998 as elsewhere in the
EC.
However, many analysts doubt Telefonica's ability to prosper in an open
market. 'The danger is not so much the increasing competition, but the way
in which big clients, the financial groups and the industrial corporations,
could find ways around the restrictions once better technology is on offer,'
says one.
Telefonica's fundamental problem is the growing domestic frustration over
its services. Monopoly status has bred a lethargic and reactive corporate
culture, say its critics. Its long distance tariffs are among the highest in
Europe, and its response to customers is slow.
A recent survey among major Spanish companies indicated that Telefonica's
customer base was divided and unsatisfied; 60 per cent of the corporations
interviewed said they would switch to another supplier if they could.
BT, which established itself in Spain four years ago, now operates three
Spanish nodes, connecting domestic clients to its global network service for
data management. Earlier this year it won a contract from Repsol, the
partially-privatised energy group and a former Telefonica customer, to
manage its external data transmission.
Last month BT delivered its boldest challenge yet to Telefonica when it
unveiled a Pounds 400m joint venture with Grupo Santander, the big banking
and financial services group, to bid for one of the forthcoming domestic
data communication licences.
The venture, which is built around Megared, a data company that Banco
Santander created in 1989 to serve its extensive branch network, aims to
capture 22 per cent of the domestic data transmission market over the next
decade.
The real blow to Telefonica was that it was perceived as being summarily
dumped by the Santander group, which had a seat on the Telefonica board, in
favour of an outside competitor. Santander informed the national
telecommunications group of its alliance with BT just one day before the
agreement was publicised. The banking group's nominee director subsequently
resigned from Telefonica's board.
Telefonica responded to BT's assault by launching its own data transmission
company, supplying voice and images as well as data and announcing that it
had secured two large clients, Caja de Madrid, the second-ranked Spanish
savings bank, and Banesto, a big private bank network, for the new service.
Nevertheless, it is clear that the umbilical cord which once linked
Telefonica to big domestic financial groups has been severed.
In the wake of the BT-Santander alliance, Banco Central Hispano, one of the
biggest Spanish banks, acquired 10 per cent of AT&amp;T Network Systems, as part
of an ambitious programme of industrial and financial co-operation with the
US telecommunications giant.
Hispano expects to maintain good relations with Telefonica, but direct
competition is inevitable. Hispano is heading one of the consortia for the
cellular phone licences. A further mobile phone consortium is lead by Banco
Bilbao Vizcaya, another big banking group.
Perhaps the most visible irony of the deregulation is that the home-based
banks have sought partnerships abroad to exploit the new trading climate,
while Telefonica has contracted the services of a foreign bank - JP Morgan -
to defend its home turf.

LOTUS Development, the US personal computer software company, reported
higher than expected third-quarter earnings, boosted by strong sales of its
applications programs for Windows, the popular Microsoft PC operating
system.
Net income for the quarter was Dollars 18.3m, or 41 cents a share, compared
with Dollars 7.3m, or 17 cents, before a stock-sale gain in last year's
quarter.
Analysts had been predicting earnings of about 34 cents a share.
Revenue totalled Dollars 240.1m, a 16 per cent increase over the
corresponding period last year.
'We continued to see strong growth in our Windows desktop and communications
businesses,' said Mr Jim Manzi, president and chief executive. 'Our
international business grew 26 per cent year-over-year for 50 per cent of
the quarter's revenue, and growth in our Windows business continued to more
than offset the decline of what was once our core business - Dos
spreadsheets.'
Among the new products launched by Lotus during the quarter was SmartSuite
2.1 for Windows, a new version of a suite of programs that includes
database, spreadsheet, wordprocessing, graphics and organiser programs.
In September, the company announced plans to consolidate its Cambridge,
Massachusetts, operations in one facility to achieve an annual cost savings
of Dollars 10m beginning in 1996.
Net income for the nine-month period totalled Dollars 45.8m, or Dollars 1.04
a share, excluding a second-quarter charge of Dollars 19.9m , or 45 cents,
associated with the acquisition of Approach Software, a database software
company.

FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: Wall Street welcomes Bell-TCI
merger
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Bell Atlantic, the US regional telephone group, soared to record
levels yester day as Wall Street continued to register its delight over
Bell's bid for Tele-Communications Inc, the biggest US cable television
company.
Bell Atlantic closed up Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 67 5/8 - on top of a
Dollars 5 7/8 rise on Wednesday when the deal was announced. TCI's A shares
closed at Dollars 32 7/8 , up Dollars 1 1/2 , on top of Wednesday's Dollars
3 rise.
It is unusual for the shares of both bidding and target company to rise by
such a large amount following the announcement of a deal. Wall Street likes
the industrial logic, does not feel Bell Atlantic is paying an excessive
premium for TCI, and is relieved that the deal is a stock swap, which does
not involve the issuance of additional debt.
The terms of the deal are complex and depend in part on just how much Bell
Atlantic is allowed to buy of TCI and of Liberty Media, a spun-off
programming subsidiary of TCI which the cable company is in the process of
re-acquiring.
It could experience delays in acquiring TCI's and Liberty's programming
assets, since these use the long-distance phone network and Bell Atlantic
will need a court waiver from regulations barring the Baby Bell companies
from the long-distance business.
It also plans to sell or spin off TCI's cable service operations, which
overlap with the area where it provides telephone services, since to acquire
them would be illegal.
Bell Atlantic is to pay 11.75 annualised cash flow for the cable properties
it is buying, while the programming and other assets would be valued at
public market value at closing.
Bell Atlantic will accomplish the merger by issuing new Class B common
stock, valued at Dollars 54 each, which is not expected to pay dividends for
five years. After that, it would pay the same dividend as Bell Atlantic's
current common stock, to be renamed Class A.
The class B stock would be convertible into class A stock after five years.
There would be a 10 per cent premium for holders of TCI's class B shares
(each of which command 10 votes) over class A shareholders.
The two companies estimate that if the acquisition of the cable assets were
completed now, Bell Atlantic would issue some 220m class B shares, worth
Dollars 11.8bn, or some Dollars 19 a TCI A share, and it would also assume
some Dollars 9.6bn of debt. The holder of each TCI A-share would receive
around 0.35 of a Bell Atlantic share. However, if the deal is not completed
until the end of next year, this could rise to 0.40 and the value of the
deal to some Dollars 13bn.
If Bell Atlantic was permitted to buy all of the Liberty-TCI assets it wants
when the deal closes, it estimates that each TCI-LIberty class A shareholder
would receive around 0.65 of class B Bell Atlantic share, pushing the total
value of the deal to Dollars 22bn to Dollars 23bn, and the value of each TCI
A share to around Dollars 35.
Bell Atlantic said it expected earnings per share dilution in the first year
after closing of around 30 per cent to 35 per cent from the initial cable
properties. Growth in earnings per share is expected to be well above 10 per
cent a year for the five-year period after closing the deal.
If there are delays in the transfer of the programming assets, Bell Atlantic
will distribute these, along with the in-region cable assets, to
shareholders in TCI-Liberty in the form of a separately traded company.

<TEXT>
LOCKHEED, the US aerospace contractor, lifted third-quarter net profit to
Dollars 117m, or Dollars 1.85 a share, from Dollars 86m, or Dollars 1.40, in
the corresponding period last year, agencies report.
This brings net profit for nine months to Dollars 287m, or Dollars 4.57 a
share, which compares with a loss of Dollars 402m, or Dollars 6.48, in the
same period of 1992.
Last year's figures, however, reflect a significant accounting charge: net
earnings before the charge equalled Dollars 3.69 a share.
Nine-month revenues increased to Dollars 9.33bn from Dollars 7.18bn, with
the third quarter generating Dollars 3.47bn against Dollars 2.47bn.
The latest quarter's figures include a gain of about Dollars 90m on
settlement of the P-7A navy aircraft dispute, partly offset by changes of
about Dollars 75m for the discontinuance of certain operations.

strength of US banking

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THREE large regional US banks - the Bank of New York, Keycorp and
Continental Bank - reported strong growth in third-quarter earnings
yesterday, providing fresh evidence that the nation's banking industry
remains in robust health.
The Bank of New York, the 17th-largest in the country, reported a 45 per
cent rise in profits to a record Dollars 151m.
Return on equity, an important measure of profitability, climbed to 15.95
per cent, from 12.65 per cent last year
The bank said that several factors had contributed to the improvement,
including contributions to earnings from the recently-acquired National
Community Banks group and from 62 branches bought from Barclays Bank of New
York.
Other positive factors included strong fee income - especially from the
processing of credit cards and securities - and a widening in interest rate
spreads, which followed a further shift in the bank's asset mix toward
high-yielding assets and a reduction in the level of non-performing assets.
Keycorp reported a 31.4 per cent improvement in its third quarter profits to
Dollars 102.6m, and return on equity of 18.44 per cent, up from 16.01 per
cent a year earlier.
The New York State-based bank will join forces next year with Society
Corporation of Cleveland in a Dollars 3.9bn merger that will create the
country's 10th largest bank.
It said that fee income rose almost 9 per cent to Dollars 117.6m in the
quarter.
Contributions from two recently-acquired banks lifted its average earning
assets to Dollars 28.9bn and its net interest income to Dollars 389.9m.
Continental Bank of Chicago reported a 28 per cent jump in third-quarter
profits to Dollars 68m, and return on equity of 16.4 per cent, up from 14.4
per cent in 1992.
The highlights of the quarter were big increases in trading profits and
equity investment revenues.
In New York, Bank of New York shares closed down Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 56
7/8 , while Keycorp was down Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 36 1/8 and Continental

GEORGIA-PACIFIC and Boise Cascade, two of the largest North American forest
products groups, narrowed their third-quarter losses in spite of the
continued weakness of the paper and pulp market.
Georgia-Pacific, the world's largest manufacturer of paper and wood
products, yesterday said it had reduced its third-quarter deficit to Dollars
36m, or 42 cents a share, from Dollars 174m, or Dollars 2.01, in the same
period of 1992. Sales were flat at Dollars 3bn.
Progress was also made by Boise Cascade. The Idaho-based group posted a loss
of Dollars 24.2m, or 91 cents a share, compared with a deficit of Dollars
35.7m, or Dollars 1.13, in the year-earlier quarter. Revenues climbed 7 per
cent to Dollars 1bn.
The improvement at Georgia-Pacific partly reflected a record performance by
the building products business, which lifted operating profits to Dollars
210m, against Dollars 200m.
Prices for lumber harvested in southern US states were well above 1992
levels, while the volume of sales was also higher.
However, the paper and pulp business, hard hit by an industry-wide slump
which began in 1989, showed little sign of rebounding.
The segment's operating loss was Dollars 10m, against Dollars 7m last time.
The results included an after-tax gain of Dollars 10m on an asset sale and
Dollars 53m in charges , bonus payments and early retirement of debt. If
these items were excluded, the company would have realised Dollars 7m in net
income.
Although the overall improvement at Boise Cascade was more modest than
Georgia-Pacific's, the Pacific north-west group had more reason to be
optimistic about its paper and pulp business.
In the paper segment, Boise Cascade made 'good progress in the areas it can
control, such as reduced costs and improved product mix,' the company said.
The division's operating loss was less than last year's figure, even though
weighted-average prices for its products were flat. The company does not
issue specific figures for its divisions.

FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: CBS sees record year after
strong third term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CBS posted record earnings for the third quarter and forecast a best ever
full year.
For the three months to end-September, the group reported net income of
Dollars 118.3m, or Dollars 7.39 a share, compared with Dollars 42.7m, or
Dollars 2.76, in the corresponding period of 1992. On a consolidated basis,
CBS's net sales were Dollars 752.6m, up 12 per cent on the 1992 quarter.
The results included a one-time gain of about Dollars 3.20 a share,
reflecting the settlement of legal disputes and tax proceedings.
The buoyant performance reflected the strength of the network's programming.
Last month's debut of Late Night starring Mr David Letterman, the popular
chat-show host, bolstered CBS's commanding lead over its rivals.
The CBS television network realised a 15 per cent gain in revenues and a
substantial increase in operating profit, in spite of the continued
sluggishness of the US economy.
In addition to higher advertising pricing, the improvement was attributed to
the absence of last year's coverage of the US political party conventions,
which fail to attract big viewing audiences.
The board raised the quarterly cash dividend to 50 cents a common share,
from 25 cents, the level in effect since the first quarter of 1991.
For the first nine months of 1993, net income was Dollars 279.9m, or Dollars
17.62 a share, on net sales of Dollars 2.47bn.
In the comparable period last year, net income was Dollars 47.7m, or Dollars
3.08 a share, on slightly improved sales of Dollars 2.54bn.

WHIRLPOOL, the world's biggest maker of large home appliances, yesterday
unveiled a 27 per cent jump in third-quarter earnings, helped by strong
results from the company's European business.
The US company turned in net earnings of Dollars 70m, or 96 cents a share,
against Dollars 55m, or 78 cents, in the same period last year on revenues
which were flat at Dollars 1.91bn.
Mr David Whitwam, chairman, said the company's operating performance in each
of its four global regions 'met or exceeded our high expectations for them'.
In North America, the company said revenues and earnings were 'better than
an outstanding third-quarter 1992,' although revenues rose faster than
operating profits.
Profits growth was dampened by the new accounting standards for
post-retirement benefits, a charge relating to ending distributor agreements
and the impact of a weakening Canadian dollar.
Industry shipments were up more than 10 per cent in the quarter and were
expected to be up between 3 per cent and 4 per cent for the year.
In Europe, the company had record operating earnings in spite of a sluggish
environment. Whirlpool said its unit shipments were higher, its costs were
significantly lower and its compressor business had a strong performance.
Whirlpool expects European industry shipments to be down by about 2 per cent
for the year.
Other overseas operations saw strong growth. Excluding Brazil, Latin
American shipments and revenues were about double.
In Asia, unit shipment and revenues rose more than 30 per cent in the
quarter but profitability declined, because of planned spending linked to
expansion in the region.
For the nine months, Whirlpool suffered a net loss of Dollars 18m, or 27
cents, including special charges.
Stripping out these charges, earnings for the period would have totalled
Dollars 202m, or Dollars 2.81. A year earlier, Whirlpool had net earnings of
Dollars 143m, or Dollars 2.03.

FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: Genentech's profits meet
expectations

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENENTECH, the US bio-technology company which is 60 per cent owned by Roche
of Switzerland, yesterday posted third-quarter profits at the top end of
expectations and predicted earnings growth in 1994.
For the three months to September 30, Genentech recorded net income of
Dollars 15.5m, or 13 cents a share, up from Dollars 7.7m, or 7 cents in the
same period of 1992. Most analysts had expected earnings of 9 cents a share
in the quarter.
Revenues advanced to Dollars 165.4m from Dollars 137.3m.
Mr Kirk Raab, chief executive, said the improvement reflected the medical
community's acceptance of the value of Genentech's Activase heart drug.
Sales of Activase slumped in 1992 amid concern over its price and
effectiveness. They started to rebound this year after a study showed heart
attack patients had a survival advantage over patients taking a rival drug.
Activase sales rose 29 per cent in the third quarter to Dollars 63.5m from
Dollars 49.4m a year earlier.
Genentech also received a boost when an FDA advisory panel recommended
approval of Genentech's next product.
'Considering the fact that in August an FDA advisory panel unanimously
recommended approval for Pulmozyme (dornase alfa) DNase for treating cystic
fibrosis, we approach 1994 with continued expectations of growth,' Mr Raab
said.
For the nine months, Genentech earned Dollars 40.3m, or 34 cents on revenues
of Dollars 488.2m, against Dollars 14.6m, or 13 cents on revenues of Dollars
402.3m the previous year.

FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: CP tries to get to grips with
Laidlaw legacy - Canadian Pacific is taking a more forceful interest in its
CDollars 500m investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASK Bill Stinson what he thinks of Mr Michael De Groote and the response is
unlikely to be flattering.
Five years ago, Mr Stinson persuaded Canadian Pacific, the Montreal-based
railway and energy conglomerate of which he is chairman, to spend more than
CDollars 500m (USDollars 376.4m) for a controlling stake in Laidlaw, the
North American waste services and schoolbus operator founded by Mr De
Groote.
The investment has proved to be a deep embarrassment both for CP and for Mr
Stinson personally.
CP's stake, which represents a 47 per cent voting interest, is now worth
about one-third of the purchase price. CP also neglected to negotiate a
non-compete agreement with Mr De Groote, who used some of the proceeds from
the sale of his shares to start a waste-management company in competition
with Laidlaw.
CP has recently moved on several fronts to erase some of the De Groote
legacy from Laidlaw. Apparently under pressure from his board to take a more
active role at Laidlaw, Mr Stinson asked Mr Donald Jackson, the chief
executive hired by Mr De Groote to succeed him, to resign.
Mr Jackson has been replaced by Mr Jim Bullock, a Laidlaw non-executive
director who was president of Cadillac Fairview, a prominent Toronto-based
property developer.
Laidlaw has also cleared the decks for the disposal or rationalisation of
several businesses acquired during the helter-skelter period of growth under
Mr De Groote.
The company this week announced fourth-quarter write-downs totalling
USDollars 349m, about two-thirds of which, or Dollars 244m, reflect the
reduced value of its 24 per cent stake in ADT, the international security
services and vehicle auction group, and its 35 per cent interest in
Attwoods, the UK-based waste-management company.
The write-downs drove Laidlaw to a loss of USDollars 292m, or Dollars 1.05 a
share, in the fiscal year to August 31, compared with earnings of USDollars
132m, or 50 cents a share, in the previous year. Revenues rose to USDollars
1.99bn from USDollars 1.93bn.
Laidlaw has been pondering the sale of its ADT stake for some time. The two
companies have little in common. ADT's entrepreneurial chief executive, Mr
Michael Ashcroft, would undoubtedly be glad to sever his links with a
company which accused him three years ago of improper accounting practices.
ADT's completion of a Dollars 1.2bn refinancing last summer means that
Laidlaw now has little reason to delay the sale of its shares any longer. By
signalling its willingness to sell, however, the Canadian company has driven
ADT's share price down by a dollar on the New York Stock Exchange in the
past week.
As for Attwoods, its disposal this week of Mindis, a troubled Atlanta-based
recycling company, has also paved the way for a new relationship with its
biggest shareholder.
The possibilities range from Laidlaw selling its Attwoods stake to some
rationalisation of the two companies' activities. Much will depend on Mr
Bullock's assessment of Laidlaw's own businesses, especially solid-waste
disposal, which is also Attwoods' core activity.
Mr Jackson had the misfortune to take the helm at Laidlaw in 1989, just as
the North American economy peaked. 'You can blame him for not acting sooner
on the problems, but you can't blame him for creating the problems,' says
one US analyst.
North American waste-management companies have been hit not only by the
recession but also by such trends as recycling and tougher regulation of
waste-disposal sites. Intense competition is reflected in plummeting
landfill fees.
Volumes and prices in the hazardous waste business have slipped even further
in the past few months. The industry's over-capacity is reflected in hefty
write-downs taken by several big companies in recent weeks.
In spite of a Dollars 105m charge against its Canadian operations in the
latest quarter, Laidlaw remains relatively strong in the North American
hazardous waste sector.
Unlike some of its competitors, which are burdened by big incinerators and
landfill sites, Laidlaw has put most of its resources into a network of
small service centres. Its solid-waste business is on a less secure footing,
however. While operations in Canada are profitable, the US division has
suffered from being too scattered.
Even before Mr Bullock's arrival, senior management had drawn up plans for a
rationalisation of the solid-waste division, involving several hundred
million dollars.
This week's moves suggest that the three senior Canadian Pacific managers on
Laidlaw's board will take a more active role than they have in the past.
When Laidlaw made a key strategic decision earlier this year to invest in a
landfill business in Italy, CP, which has a reputation as a bureaucratic
company, made its displeasure known only after the deal had gone through.
The signs that CP is now taking a more forceful interest in its investment
may also indicate, however, that it has not yet completed the job of erasing
its unhappy experience.
For the past year, Mr Stinson has described the Laidlaw stake as 'a
portfolio investment' outside CP's main transport and energy interests. CP
is understood to have held talks already with several prospective buyers,
though all have so far proved abortive.
CP values Laidlaw on its books at CDollars 13.50 a share, well above the
market price of CDollars 7.63. One source familiar with CP predicts that 'if
the stock ever gets close to the carrying value, they'll be gone.'

THE Mexican government is cutting the tax that domestic companies pay on
their interest on foreign bank loans. This is expected to reduce their cost
of funding in foreign currencies.
The government plans to reduce, initially for a two-year period, the
withholding tax to 4.9 per cent, from 15 per cent, on their interest on bank
loans. This will cut the cost of foreign bank funding by one-tenth.
The tax reduction is expected to increase capital flows into Mexico.
It may also put pressure on Mexican banks to lower their interest rates.
The move will not affect bonds issued by Mexican companies, which are exempt
from the tax.

BUOYANT trading and corporate finance revenues helped New York banking group
JP Morgan post a 48 per cent increase in third-quarter earnings to Dollars
468m yesterday.
The results were better than most Wall Street analysts had expected, but
disappointment among some investors who were unhappy with the modest decline
in trading earnings, and profit-taking by others after a recent strong run
by bank stocks, left JP Morgan's share price down Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 77
3/4 by the close on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.
Sir Dennis Weatherstone, the bank's chairman, remarked that 'the year so far
has presented plentiful opportunities, and we've been prepared to capitalise
on them around the world', and said he was particularly pleased with JP
Morgan's return on equity, which rose to 23.9 per cent from 18.8 per cent a
year ago.
Trading revenues again made the biggest contribution to JP Morgan's bottom
line. Although they failed to match the record Dollars 520m achieved in the
second quarter, they remained strong at Dollars 464m, up 50 per cent from a
year ago thanks to big returns from the trading of debt instruments, swaps
and other interest rate contracts, particularly in Europe and emerging
markets.
Although trading remains at the core of JP Morgan's business, analysts said
yesterday that they were impressed by the bank's efforts to boost its
earnings from other business lines. In particular, analysts singled out for
praise the 14 per cent increase in corporate finance revenues to Dollars
140m. The improvement was due mostly to a rise in fees from the underwriting
of securities issues.
Other business segments also showed strong growth. Investment management
fees rose 20 per cent to Dollars 116m, operational services fees (primarily
from custody, clearing and brokerage services) climbed 14 per cent to
Dollars 122m, and gains from the bank's investments in equity and
fixed-income securities edged ahead to Dollars 98m. 'Other' revenues soared
to Dollars 179m following a big gain from sale of part of JP Morgan's
investment in Hospital Corporation of America and net gains from equities
sales.
Finally, net interest income fell slightly to Dollars 439m.

FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: Ferruzzi restructuring under way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ADMINISTRATORS of the collapsed Ferruzzi-Montedison group yesterday carried
out the first phase of a complex restructuring plan.
This involved the approval of the half-yearly accounts of Montedison, the
quoted industrial operations of the Ferruzzi family, which showed a loss of
L741bn (Dollars 468m) against a loss of L188bn during the same period the
previous year.
Operating results were already announced at a board meeting on September 30.
Net operating profit was up from L398bn to L784bn on turnover of L10,287bn.
But approval was delayed because the administrators had been unable to
include in the accounts the effect of a freeze for the year of debt
payments.
Yesterday, half-year financial charges were written at L753bn. A statement
accompanying the accounts said that accountants Deloitte &amp; Touche had
included exceptional losses of L243bn as a result of operations by
Montedison International Holding and its subsidiaries.
The debt moratorium affecting service of financial debt totalling L25,000bn
has been the subject of intense negotiation with nearly L1800bn in lost
interest at stake.
However, yesterday's meeting was able to go ahead as planned after 21
Italian banks representing 70 per cent of the outstanding bank debt gave
their formal approval to the restructuring plan of the Ferruzzi empire.
Foreign banks accounting for L6,500bn of debt have refused to accept the
debt moratorium until they have fully studied the restructuring plan. They
are unlikely to give their answer before the end of the month.
The restructuring is based round the debt moratorium followed by a
subsequent consolidation of L18,900bn worth of debt at below market rates.

SHELL ESPANA, the Spanish subsidiary of the Anglo-Dutch petroleum group,
yesterday took an important step into the domestic energy market when it
paid Pta12.5bn (Dollars 96m) for a 5 per cent stake in Compania Logistica de
Hidrocardburos (CLH), the nationwide oil distribution network which is owned
by the three refining companies that operate in Spain.
Shell bought the equity from Repsol, the partially privatised Spanish energy
group which reduced its stake in CLH from 66 to 61 per cent. CLH, formerly
the Spanish government's petroleum monopoly under its previous name of
Campsa, reported after-tax profits of Pta35bn last year for its distribution
business.
Following the break up of Campsa's monopoly at the begining of this year and
the formation of CLH, the distribution network's new shareholders, in
addition to Repsol, became Cepsa, a Spanish refiner that is a third owned by
Elf-Aquitaine of France, with 25 per cent of the equity, and British
Petroleum, which bought the domestic refiner Petromed two years ago and
holds 7 per cent of CLH.
Shell, which becomes the only CLH shareholder not to own refining
installations in Spain, has by its acquisition illustrated a short-cut route
into the domestic market.
Repsol said there were in principle no objections to further reductions of
its CLH equity.
Repsol's sale to Shell will realise the Spanish energy group capital gains
of between Pta8bn-Pta9bn.

FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: Ericsson joins Inmarsat
consortium
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ERICSSON, the Swedish telecommunications manufacturer, has thrown its weight
behind Inmarsat, a 71-nation satellite operator, in the race to create a
global mobile telecommunications network.
The link has created the biggest potential competitor yet to rival a Dollars
3.4bn scheme proposed by US company Motorola.
Both organisations plan to launch a series of telecommunications satellites
by the end of the decade which would allow a single portable telephone to be
operated anywhere in the world.
Mr Kurt Hellstrom, the president of Ericsson Radio Systems, said yesterday
that he would work 'with Inmarsat to develop the necessary infrastructure'
for the network so that a portable telephone could switch automatically
between a cellular network and a satellite link.
Ericsson and Motorola are two of the world's biggest companies involved in
building cellular telephone networks and handsets. Inmarsat is a
co-operative established in 1979 to provide satellite communications for
ships. Since then it has moved into new markets for emergency services and
the media.
Mr Hellstrom said that Ericsson preferred to join forces with Inmarsat over
Motorola because of Inmarsat's 'open system' plan which would allow any
manufacturer to make telephones for the network.
The Inmarsat scheme, called Project 21, faces a struggle to catch up with
Motorola's plan, called Iridium. Companies from North and South America,
Europe and Asia have already agreed to provide Motorola's consortium with
Dollars 100m in cash and promised another Dollars 700m as the first stage in
financing Iridium.
Normally, Inmarsat would have to turn to its owners, such as Comsat in the
US and European telecommunications organisations like BT and France Telecom,
to contribute to the capital cost of a network of satellites.
But earlier this week, Inmarsat said it would reorganise to become more like
the private sector with which it is increasingly competing. It will propose
next year that its 71 members be allowed to buy and sell stakes in Inmarsat.
Mr Olof Lundberg, director general of Inmarsat said: 'If we are going to
join the commercial world, we need a new set of attitudes.'
He said that Inmarsat would have to move closer to mass markets and learn
about marketing and bring products and services quickly to the market place.

sale

<TEXT>
KLOCKNER-WERKE, the diversified German steel group, is in talks with three
international groups to sell a majority stake in its steel plant in Bremen.
The company said yesterday in was holding 'intensive discussions' to sell
its integrated steel plant, which employs 4,600 in the city state of Bremen
and has an annual crude steel capacity of 3m tonnes.
The potential bidders are a consortium co-ordinated by the Bremen state
government, grouping local companies and Sidmar, a subsidiary of the Arbed
steelmaker of Luxembourg; Thyssen and Krupp-Hoesch, Germany's two largest
steelmakers, which have held talks with Usinor-Sacilor of France about
linking for a bid; and Hoogovens, the Dutch steel producer.
These talks lend weight to the belief that Mr Hans Chritoph von Rohr, the
chairman of Klockner-Werke, intends to sell the steel activities. The
company narrowly escaped bankruptcy earlier this year due to a debt relief
scheme which allowed it to write off nearly half its DM2.7bn (Dollars 1.7bn)
debt. The group's steel activities recorded a DM200m loss in the year ended
September 30, 1992.
Following the debt relief scheme, Klockner-Werke sold its special steel
subsidiary for a symbolic DM2 to Mr Jurgen Grossmann, its chairman, and
Druker, a Frankfurt-based consultancy company acquiring 25 per cent of the
shares.
Thyssen reiterated yesterday that it was only interested in buying the
cold-rolling mill and not other parts of the Bremen steel mill, which
produces flat steel products.
But a Klockner-Werke spokesman said that the company 'was only interested in
selling a majority stake'.
The Bremen government recently moved to block the Thyssen offer because of
fears that the German steel group would close down most of the mill and
eliminate a competitor in the German steel market.
'We are convinced that the plant is competitive and should survive,' Mr
Claus Jager, Bremen economics minister, said.
The consortium is believed to include companies in Bremen whose survival
depends on the activities of the Klockner steel plant. These include the
Bremen Vulcan shipyards, already receiving state subsidies. They also
include the city's electricity utility for which the steel plant is a major
client and which is slated for privatisation.

FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: Santander acquires City property
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRUPO SANTANDER, the Spanish banking and financial services holding, aims to
spend up to Pounds 100m (Dollars 151m) on City of London property as part of
a strategy to diversify its business interests and build up profit centres
outside Spain.
Santander said yesterday it had spent some Pounds 18m to acquire D'Arcy
House at 146 Queen Victoria Street and a further Pounds 13.75m to buy 1
Bishopsgate, the London headquarters of Fidelity Bank. It is in the final
stages of purchasing a third property close to St Paul's Cathedral for about
Pounds 20m.
A spokesman for the group said acquisitions, which mark Santander's first
move into real estate, would continue in the City and with an investment
ceiling of Pounds 100m. 'London has been preferred to other centres because
of the profitability of its property market,' he said.
Santander's business diversification strategy was underlined last month when
it announced a Pounds 400m joint venture with British Telecommunications to
develop data transmission services in Spain.
Mr Emilio Botin, the Santander chairman, told shareholders earlier this year
that he aimed to increase the group's presence abroad and wished to raise
the proportion of the group's net profits earned outside Spain from a
present level of just over 30 per cent to 50 per cent.

FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: Fate of Groupe Bull chairman in
balance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FATE of Mr Bernard Pache, 58, chairman and chief executive of Groupe
Bull, the state-owned French computer manufacturer, was in the balance last
night.
There is sharp disagreement between the industry ministry and the finance
ministry over whether Mr Pache should be replaced or allowed to oversee his
plan for the recovery of the loss-making company. The French cabinet has yet
to take a decision.
According to sources close to the government, Mr Gerard Longuet, the
industry minister, has decided that Mr Pache, chairman for little more than
a year, should be replaced by Mr Jean-Marie Descarpentries, a former head of
the French packaging company Carnaud, who has a reputation for vigorous
management methods.
Mr Longuet is believed to be exasperated by slow progress in the
transformation of Bull from a loss-making company which is out of touch with
its market to a suitable candidate for privatisation.
Groupe Bull would not say that Mr Pache was to be replaced. One senior
executive said: 'There is a long distance between one minister's desk and
the Council of Ministers,' implying that the French government would not
automatically rubber stamp Mr Longuet's decision.
If Mr Pache, formerly the French coal board chairman, is replaced by Mr
Descarpentries it will leave Bull for the second time, and at its most
vulnerable point, in the hands of someone who has little experience of the
computer industry. The company is in desperate straits, having lost FFr15bn
(Dollars 2.65bn) over the past three years.
Mr Pache's recovery plan, which is likely to be published next week, will
call for up to FFr9.2bn of state aid. Negotiations between Mr Pache and Mr
Longuet over the size of the capital injection required are thought to have
held up earlier announcement of the recovery measures.

FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: Blick says it plans acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BLICK, the communications systems and time products company, announced
yesterday that it was in discussions which might 'lead to the acquisition of
a substantial business'. This is thought to mean between Pounds 40m and
Pounds 60m.
At the same time, the group estimated pre-tax profits for the year to
September 30 would be not less than Pounds 9.3m (Pounds 8.6m).
It also revealed cash balances at the year-end were more than Pounds 6.6m
(Pounds 7.3m). It said it intended to lift the final dividend to 6.9p (6.2p)
to make 10.2p (9.2p) for the year.
Mr Ian Scott-Gall, managing director, said Blick had been 'stalking' the
acquisition for some time and that heads of agreement had been signed in the
summer. The negotiations, in effect, had prevented the group rebriefing its
broker, he said, and that the share price had been 'under attack'.
He added that he was aware of what had happened recently to Tiphook and
Automated Security (Holdings) and that he did not want the group's silence
to be misinterpreted. As it is, the estimates are largely in line with most
analysts' expectations.
Some analysts, however, have suggested the release of the estimates is an
effort to stop the downward pressure on the shares, because Blick will have
to issue paper to make the acquisition. Mr Scott-Gall said: 'We are happy to
gear up if an acquisition is on the cards.'
On February 5 the shares stood at 565p; on October 11, they fell 11p to
453p; and yesterday they declined a further 8p to 445p.
Possible acquisition candidates include Granada's Electronic Rentals, Cable
&amp; Wireless's Telephone Rentals, or part of Plessey unwanted by GEC. The deal
is likely to be priced on a cash-flow basis with adjustments for the value
of the assets.

FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: Banks gag on money market
illiquidity - Volatile overnight rates are causing disquiet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR decades, London has been one of the world's most attractive financial
centres, with a strong tradition of deregulation that has attracted trading
in currencies, bonds and international equities.
Recently, however, some commercial bank dealers have been concerned by what
they regard as unfair competition in an important arena of financial trading
in the City: the sterling money markets and the operations of the Bank of
England in them.
One of the primary functions of the Bank of England is to ensure commercial
banks have an adequate supply of wholesale cash to meet their daily
requirements. The price at which the central bank offers wholesale cash to
the banking sector is critical in determining the level of money-market
interest rates.
In theory, there should be a steady and even flow of cash through the
system, ensuring that there are no liquidity shortages - and therefore no
sharp fluctuations in short-dated interest rates along the money-market
yield curve.
But, recent months have seen acute daily liquidity shortages in the sterling
cash market. Some commercial banks have been unable to acquire wholesale
cash when they need it - and the cost of overnight money has soared as high
as 20 per cent.
By contrast, call money in Germany has hovered between roughly 6.5 per cent
and 8 per cent, despite an exchange rate mechanism crisis which caused acute
problems in German money markets.
The volatility in sterling rates is of concern to dealers. Commercial
bankers might lend money for repayment in 6 months, 'funding' that position
by borrowing interbank cash at overnight rates.
'Predicting what the overnight rate will be is like predicting the British
weather,' says the head of money markets at a leading US investment bank in
the City. 'We simply do not know what the cost of money will be on any given
day.'
Other dealers believe that the volatility reflects faultlines in the Bank of
England's money market operations which need to be repaired. 'The root of
the problem is that the power to control overnight rates now lies in the
hands of a few of the major London clearing banks who dominate the system,'
said the head of money markets at a leading French commercial bank in
London.
Critics are reluctant to speak publicly. They are concerned not to
compromise their relationships with the central bank. But they have three
complaints:
First, they argue that the Bank of England removed a substantial pool of
liquidity at the heart of the banking system by changing the rules of
liquidity management in the UK in the late 1980s.
Under the old rules, commercial banks had to deposit minimum sums of cash,
called 'club money', with a group of intermediaries called discount houses.
In the late 1980s, the rules were changed. Banks were placed under less
rigid obligations to provide reserves to discount houses. Instead, they were
allowed to hold these assets in the form of bills on their books as a means
of meeting minimum reserve requirements.
Several UK clearing banks have a substantial advantage over other market
players because their activities give them huge holdings of these eligible
bills, which are essentially a post-dated cheque mainly issued by companies
and the principal instrument which the Bank accepts in return for lending
wholesale cash.
Some dealers say that the holding of eligible bills by two of the UK
clearers - NatWest and Barclays - is so great that they have effectively
'cornered' the market.
These clearers are certainly operating within their rights. But they are
thought to control the trade in 30 to 40 per cent of all eligible bills
between them. If they are in a net lending position, it is in their
interests to keep the overall shortage of cash in the discount market very
large, thereby ensuring a high overnight interest rate. If they are in a net
borrowing position, it is in their interests to remove the shortage quickly
and bring the overnight interest rate down.
The government's expected public sector borrowing requirement - at Pounds
50bn - has exacerbated the strains on the system.
The PSBR is funded through sales of gilt-edged securities, which pass
liquidity from the banking system back to the central bank. The stock of
assistance that the Bank has provided in the past 12 months has been large -
and this has created regular money market shortages, giving even more power
to those clearers with the power to remove the shortage through their
holdings of eligible bills.
Commercial bankers want to reform the system. Some are calling for the
introduction of a gilt repo (repurchase) system, which would allow them to
offer gilt-edged securities to the Bank of England in return for cash
borrowings. This would widen the collateral which could be offered for funds
beyond the use of commercial bills - and hence reduce the power of those who
dominate the market.
Others are calling for the introduction of a German-style banking system,
with direct dealing relationships between the central bank and commercial
banks, minimum reserve requirements and a system in which interest rates
fluctuate inside a 'corridor.'
Bank of England officials acknowledge that the growth of the stock of
assistance has put strains on the dealing system. But they argue that the
problem will diminish with time as the level of gilt sales is reduced.
One official said recently: 'We would be happier if there were less
volatility in the overnight rate.' But that concern does not extend to any
reconsideration of how the system operates.
Following the heavy intervention in support of sterling in the exchange rate
mechanism last year, the Bank started to provide special facilities which
allow for cash borrowing in return for gilts and other securities. Officials
say that the system may be extended. But, they have said that the
introduction of a gilt repo system would only take place if that were in the
interests of the gilt market, first and foremost.
Nevertheless, the unhappiness in the market is unlikely to die down. 'We
used to take very big positions in sterling money markets because we were
reasonably certain how the system would operate,' says one foreign
commercial banker in London. 'Now we are reducing our exposure. the whole
thing can't be good for London as a financial centre.'

FT  15 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Lasmo rejects Moody's arguments on
downgrading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LASMO, the independent oil exploration and production company, yesterday
rejected arguments used by Moody's on Wednesday in sharply downgrading the
rating of its senior debt and preference shares.
Moody's cited Lasmo's vulnerability to low oil prices as the main reason for
cutting the rating on senior debt from Baa1 to Baa3 and on preference shares
from Baa2 to Ba1. It also said that Lasmo's 'management appears to be
willing to accept a higher, permanent level of financial risk.'
'We don't like debt, but we don't think that out debt is out of control,' Mr
Michael Pavia, finance director, countered yesterday. He noted that plans to
increase net debt to between 80 and 90 per cent of shareholders' funds by
1995 from its present level of 70 per cent arose directly from Lasmo having
to spend Pounds 350m as its share of the development costs of the Liverpool
Bay field.
Mr Pavia stressed that financing for the project is in place, and that
Liverpool Bay posed no special technical challenges.
'After completion of the Liverpool Bay development in 1995-96, the level of
gearing is forecast to fall rapidly,' the company said.
Lasmo shares lost 1 1/2 p to close at 136p. Volume was slightly above
average at 3.9m shares.

FT  15 OCT 93 / UK Company News: El Oro Mining down to Pounds 0.75m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
El Oro Mining and Exploration, an investment and dealing company, announced
a fall in pre-tax profits from a restated Pounds 1.12m to Pounds 751,000 for
the half year to June 30.
Earnings per share declined to 11.73p (17.67p) and there is no dividend
(24p).
El Oro has a 48.26 per cent interest in the Exploration Company, which in
turn has 34.45 per cent of El Oro.
The Exploration Company reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 827,000 for the
six months to end-June, compared with a restated Pounds 1.41m. Earnings were
4.89p (8.24p) per share. No dividend is declared (12p).
Mr Michael Woodbine Parish, chairman of both companies, said the results had
been affected by the decision to switch from short-term deposits into growth
investments. That had resulted in a reduction in interest receivable and an
increase in the market value of group assets.

JOHN MAUNDERS, the resid-ential property developer, suffered a profits fall
from a restated Pounds 4.23m to Pounds 3.84m pre-tax for the year to
end-June.
Turnover improved to Pounds 59.8m (Pounds 52m) while legal completions rose
from 775 to 904. Interest charges were reduced to Pounds 1.54m (Pounds
1.83m).
The 'introduction of a new product range, an excellent portfolio of land,
modest gearing and a satisfactory forward sales position', prompted
directors to recommend an increased final dividend of 2.85p, making a 5.15p
(4.95p) total.
Earnings per share emerged at 10.36p (11.52p).

FT  15 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Demand is heavy for Scotia placing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE placing of shares in Scotia Holdings, a budding research-based
pharmaceutical company that has financed its growth from sales of products
based on evening primrose oil, was subscribed more than 3.5 times.
The company said demand had been such that it increased the amount it had
raised from Pounds 30m to Pounds 40.6m, and that the placing price of 290p
had been at the top end of expectations.
The offer of 14m shares, about 22.5 per cent of Scotia's enlarged capital,
values the company at Pounds 181m.
Institutions are likely to be scaled back more than private investors who
applied through financial intermediaries. Trading will begin on October 25.
The directors have sold none of their stakes and have agreed not to sell any
shares for at least 360 days.
Scotia will use the proceeds of the float to repay debt and fund development
of a number of products in the late stage of clinical trials.
The company has five drugs, all developed from an understanding of lipids
which make up the structure of membranes of cells. The products are either
in or about to start the third phase of clinical trials.
Mr David Horrobin, chief executive and founder, says he is hopeful all five
will reach the market.
The three most advanced projects address widely different clinical
conditions. EF4, which probably has the biggest potential market, would
address diabetic neuropathy - a condition which leaves diabetics with
damaged peripheral blood vessels leading to neurological problems. The drug
is in phase-three trials.
The second drug, EF13, is being investigated as a potential anti-cancer
agent that could prolong life in patients diagnosed as having pancreatic
cancer.
The third most advanced product, EF27, is designed to reduce the harmful
side-effects of radiotherapy, which is used on half of patients with cancer.
Radiotherapy's effectiveness is limited by the damage done to skin.
Scotia is unusual among new drug companies in that it has concentrated on
lipid technology, a field where it has been left largely unchallenged.

FT  15 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Rolls-Royce and ABB end joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASEA BROWN Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, and Rolls-Royce, the
aero-engines and industrial power group, are ending their four-year old
partnership which had been created to seek contracts in the UK market for
gas-fired power stations.
ABB is paying an undisclosed sum for Rolls-Royce's 50 per cent stake in the
Newcastle-based joint venture company, NEI ABB Gas Turbines.
The venture, which was established in December 1989, was an important step
for both companies, which wanted to pursue opportunities created by the
privatisation of the electricity industry and the 'dash for gas.'
NEI, the power plant company known formerly as Northern Engineering
Industries, had been bought by Rolls-Royce earlier in 1989, but lacked a
range of heavy-duty gas turbines that would allow it to participate in the
fast-growing UK market for combined-cycle power stations.
ABB, meanwhile, believed that linking up with a UK supplier with
long-established contacts in the domestic power market would help it win
business.
However, Rolls-Royce's wide-ranging global technology transfer, marketing
and co-operation deal last year with Westinghouse of the US - a main rival
of ABB in the power plant business - raised questions about the future of
the NEI ABB venture, which was limited to the UK.
Yesterday, Rolls-Royce said it preferred to concentrate on its relationship
with Westinghouse than the link-up with ABB.
The work, formerly carried out by the joint venture, which employs 41
people, will be included in ABB Power Plants, a new company ABB is
establishing to cover all its UK power plant activities.
This will be headed by Mr Alan Dixon, previously managing director of the
joint venture, and will continue to be based in Newcastle.
The new company will take on the joint venture's main contract to build a
500MW combined cycle station at Deeside, North Wales, for National Power,
due for completion next year.

FT  15 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Quadrant back in the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Quadrant Group jumped 7p to 39p after the photographic and video
equipment company reported strong progress towards recovery with a return to
the black in the half year to August 31.
Operating losses on continuing activities were cut by 82 per cent, from
Pounds 1.49m to Pounds 263,000. After exceptional credits of Pounds 1.33m
(Pounds 11.3m debits) and interest, the pre-tax profit came through at
Pounds 1.02m, against a Pounds 12.5m deficit before.
Lord Rees, chairman, said he expected a further improvement in operating
results in the second half.
The successful disposal of the lossmaking estate agency photoprocessing
activities generated an exceptional profit of Pounds 861,000, while the
re-negotiation of the deferred consideration for the disposal of its
shipping activity resulted in an additional Pounds 470,000 credit above the
line.
Lord Rees said Sangers and Leeds - the distributors of photographic and
other imaging products - had returned to profit.
He added that Quadrant Video had stabilised under new management after a
poor second half last year. Further losses had been incurred in the period,
but a much improved second half was expected.
Turnover dropped to Pounds 22.9m (Pounds 28.8m), of which Pounds 22.7m
(Pounds 25.2m) related to continuing activities. Earnings per share were
4.36p, against 45.47p losses.
There is again no interim dividend.

FT  15 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Chillington advances to Pounds 0.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN IMPROVED performance from the tropical agriculture division enabled
Chillington Corporation, the conglomerate with interests in plantations and
engineering, to record a rise in interim profits from Pounds 319,000 to
Pounds 808,000 pre-tax.
The improvement came on turnover from continuing operations of Pounds 25.1m
(Pounds 24m).
The figures included Pounds 489,000 (Pounds 261,000) from Anglo-Eastern
Plantations. Chillington is selling most of its 49.2 per cent stake in
Anglo-Eastern to Genton International of Hong Kong for Pounds 8.57m.
Chillington, which has other plantation interests in Indonesia and Africa,
said the profits growth was achieved in spite of losses of Pounds 639,000 in
its forge and foundry division.
The group sold its Manchester-based forge, formerly Eva Brothers, for Pounds
285,000 in August and the directors are considering proposals for a
management buy-out at Thomas Seager, its foundry.
Earnings per share rose from 0.1p to 2.08p and interim dividends are
restored via a 0.75p payment.
Chillington is proposing to convert each existing deferred share to one
ordinary share. The deferred shares represent about 31 per cent of total
issued share capital.
A 1-for-12 scrip issue is also proposed.

FT  15 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Wm Sindall passes preference
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WILLIAM SINDALL, the builder, reported increased pre-tax losses of Pounds
619,000 for the half year to June 30, against Pounds 417,000. Turnover was
Pounds 24.6m compared with Pounds 22m.
The loss eliminates distributable reserves and the company will not be able
to pay the dividend on the 5.625 per cent convertible preference shares.
However, the company said it was in the process of disposing of properties
before the end of the year which would allow payment to be made.
Operating profit was Pounds 91,000 (Pounds 580,000) and there were
redundancy costs of Pounds 144,000 (Pounds 138,000). The pre-tax figure was
helped by lower interest charges of Pounds 566,000 (Pounds 859,000).
Losses per share increased to 11.59p (7.55p).
Directors said rental income had held up well but other trading had been
difficult. They added that there was no real sign of improvement in the
construction sector in the immediate future.
The arrangements with its bankers and other financial institutions to give
the company a secure financial future were now being formalised.

Losses at Tudor, the floor and wall tile distributor, widened from Pounds
117,000 to Pounds 240,000 pre-tax for the half year to June 30.
Turnover of Pounds 8.63m compared with Pounds 7.81m. Directors said the
ceramic tile market had shown a gradual improvement until the early part of
April after which the market declined.
They added that during the half year the company had to contend with a
considerable amount of price cutting but despite that was able to improve
market share and gross profit margins.
United Tiles, whose sales represents 90 per cent of group turnover, was
currently trading at turnover levels similar to the corresponding period and
was 'trading profitably'.
Losses deepened to 2.2p (1.06p).

FT  15 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Parkdean shares up 8p on first day

   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Parkdean Leisure, the holiday park operator, ended their first day
of dealings at 128p, compared with the 120p issue price.
Mr Graham Wilson, managing director, said he was pleased with the shares'
reception on the market and it was 'a solid start' to life as a public
company.
The group currently owns seven parks but wants to expand by acquisition,
using funds made available through the flotation. Parkdean believes it can
add new parks without a corresponding rise in overheads. Mr Wilson said he
had already had calls from people with parks to sell.
The shares had been placed with institutions. Turnover was 1.29m shares. It
is thought that one of the venture capital backers took advantage of the
price rise to sell some of its shares.
Two of its parks in East Anglia have been affected by floods, but its
insurance is expected to cover any damage.

FT  15 OCT 93 / UK Company News: BSM comes to market with Pounds 47m
valuation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BSM GROUP, owner of the British School of Motoring, yesterday finalised its
flotation, pricing the shares at 170p, which will give the company a market
capitalisation of just over Pounds 47m.
Half the total of 19.83m ordinary 10p shares on offer will be placed with
institutions, with the remainder offered through intermediaries. The
flotation will raise a net Pounds 32.1m for the company.
Mr Paul Massey, chief executive, said the flotation would clear debts
incurred in the management buy-out of 1990 and leave the company ungeared.
It would then be able to take advantage of good growth prospects and expand.
The group, currently in the middle of its first television advertising
programme for 10 years, believes there is pent up demand for driving lessons
after three years of recession. It also expects further growth to follow
legislative changes and a rising population of 17-year-olds.
It also expects to expand its health and safety division, which provides
training for company car drivers, and MCR, its vehicle repair business.
These two divisions account for about 10 per cent of total turnover.
A pro forma balance sheet at July 2 shows the group with net assets of
Pounds 2.19m after taking the flotation into account, compared with net
liabilities of Pounds 30.3m before the flotation.
British School of Motoring is one of the largest franchisers in the UK and
claims 15 per cent of the driving school market. It operates through 134
branches from Aberdeen to Plymouth, and has 2,000 self-employed instructors
whose cars cover 1m miles a week.
It is forecasting operating profits of Pounds 4.55m for the 1993 year, up
from Pounds 4.11m, on turnover of Pounds 21m. The notional net dividend is
5.78p, giving a notional gross yield at the issue price of 4.25 per cent.
The prospectus also shows that the group expects a 75 per cent tax charge
for 1993. This is a one-off charge arising mainly from planning measures
being taken in relation to capital allowances on the tuition vehicle fleet.
Next year tax should drop to 25 per cent.
After the flotation the directors, including non-executives, will have 1.7
per cent of the company, Deutsche Bank (Morgan Grenfell Group) 7.6 per cent
and Sir Anthony Jacobs, the previous owner, 4.5 per cent.
A further 3.6 per cent of the shares will be available under priority
arrangements to employees and instructors.
The placing and intermediaries offer was arranged by Morgan Grenfell.
Dealings in the shares begin on October 27.
COMMENT
priced, reflecting the management's need to get rid of the debt before it
can take the business forward. The prize asset is the brand name, which
gives it a national profile. There is probably a good deal of potential
demand for driving lessons following the recession, but while BSM's prices
tend to be a benchmark for the rest of the industry, they are at the top of
the range in a market which is very easy to enter, and people with little
money to spend may well go for smaller, local operators. In the longer term
the AA, which operates 500 driving school cars, will keep up the competitive
pressure. The 1993 notional yield of 4.25 per cent is only just above the
market average and the p/e, disallowing the big tax charge, is about 15. Not
a lot to get excited about, but more than 70 per cent of the shares will be
in the market, giving good liquidity.

FT  15 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Comac rights to fund Pounds 18.5m purchase
of Computer Search
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PHILIP Swinstead, former chief executive of SD-Scicon, the computing
services company acquired two years ago by EDS of the US, is once again at
the head of a large information technology company.
Comac, the small USM-quoted computer staff agency in which he has a
controlling interest, is buying Computer Search and Selection, a private
company which is the UK's largest independent provider of contract computer
staff.
The consideration is Pounds 18.5m, satisfied by Pounds 4m in shares and
Pounds 14.5m in cash or loan notes.
Comac intends to raise Pounds 21.8m through a 4-for-1 rights issue at 85p a
share to settle the cash portion of the consideration, repay the enlarged
group's indebtedness of Pounds 2.5m and provide working capital.
The brokers to the issue, fully underwritten by Samuel Montagu, are James
Capel.
Dealings in Comac were suspended yesterday at 90p.
Both companies specialise in finding computer staff with specialised skills.
CSS was founded in 1981 by Mr John Sharpe who remains the large shareholder.
From a base of 50 consultants in 1982 it now has more than 1,000 contractors
placed with client companies.
In the year to March 26 1993 turnover was Pounds 53m with pre-tax profits of
Pounds 2m.
Comac, founded in 1973, joined the USM in 1989. It had a turnover of Pounds
11.1m in 1992 with a profit before tax of Pounds 447,000.
Mr Swinstead became chief executive of Comac in June this year following the
purchase of a 19.5 per cent stake for Pounds 750,000. The acquisition of CSS
is part of his strategy to create a computing services company.
A particular trend in the sector is towards the use of contract staff
supplied by specialist agencies, rather than the maintenance of large
in-house data processing departments.
Mr Swinstead said: 'The agency industry is fragmented and we believe it will
be restructured over the next few years, just like the software industry in
the 1980s.

BARLOWS, the Chester-based property investment and development group,
reported a reduced deficit of Pounds 202,000 before tax for the six months
to June 30.
The outcome, compiled under FRS 3, compared with a restated loss of Pounds
368,000 and came on rental income of Pounds 768,000 (Pounds 819,000).
Mr Nicholas Berry, chairman, said the group should return to the black next
year.
This would follow measures to minimise letting voids and to reduce overheads
coupled with benefits of rental reversions.
Losses per share narrowed to 1p (1.78p).
The interim dividend is omitted (0.825p)

FT  15 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Sema to acquire part of Swedish software
group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SEMA group, the Anglo-French computing services company listed in London, is
spending SKr250m (Pounds 20.5m) to buy the main part of a Swedish
state-owned information technology company.
Sema yesterday reached agreement with the Swedish government to buy the
facilities management, information services, consulting and systems
integration businesses of SKDforetagen.
The deal gives Sema its first presence in Scandinavia and strengthens the
company's position in Europe in facilities management.
FM, a fast growing trend in information technology, means a company takes
responsibility for a customer's data processing requirements. Sema said
yesterday that it believed the acquisition would strengthen its hand in
bidding for UK government market-testing contracts.
SKD had turnover of Pounds 92.3m in 1992. It is one of Sweden's largest IT
companies and was formed as a result of the merger of the state companies
DAFA, which processes data for the government, and Statskonsult, which
develops administrative systems. Customers include Volvo.
In the first six months of the current year, Sema's pre-tax profits rose 38
per cent to Pounds 10.6m on revenues up 19 per cent at Pounds 232m.
The SKD sale is the latest in a steady programme of privatisation, covering
35 wholly or partly state-owned companies embarked upon by the centre-right
government of Mr Carl Bildt since it came to power two years ago.
Yesterday's deal was small, compared with the large privatisation issues
already carried out, such as this year's SKr2.2bn flotation of Celsius, the
defence group, and those still to come, such as Procordia's pharmaceutical
business and the government's share of the OK Petroleum group.
However, it confirmed the government's willingness to include foreign buyers
at a time when the issue of growing foreign influence in Swedish industry is
the subject of keen debate, mainly precipitated by the proposed merger of
Volvo's car and truck operations with France's Renault and a spate of
foreign buying recently on the Stockholm stock exchange.

FT  15 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Offshoot sale boosts Hunting - Fall in
aviation profits to Pounds 2.63m prompts review of approach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUNTING, the aviation, defence and oil services company, reported interim
profits up 32 per cent, helped by the sale of businesses, but was downbeat
about prospects in aviation.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 rose from Pounds 13.5m to
Pounds 17.7m on sales from continuing operations up 44 per cent at Pounds
508m as a result of three months' contribution from its new contract to
manage the government's Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston.
The profit figure was struck after a Pounds 2m charge to cover relocation of
a business from Sussex and a Pounds 5.82m exceptional profit from the sale
of its coatings division to Williams Holdings in February.
Operating profit from continuing operations rose from Pounds 15.6m to Pounds
17.3m.
The contribution from the aviation division fell Pounds 2m to Pounds 2.63m.
Mr Ken Miller, chief executive, said the group had not been able to escape
the realities in the aviation market that has seen a further slackening of
demand in the last few months.
The recently awarded Ministry of Defence contract covering Rolls-Royce
Conway engines had also led to lower than anticipated demand and the level
of overhauls was half anticipated volumes.
Mr Miller said the group would be reviewing whether there was a need to
alter the way it approached the aviation market. 'It is going to be three
years before aviation starts to grow as an industry,' he said.
By contrast, the defence and oil services divisions held up well. Operating
profit from the oil business jumped from Pounds 7.41m to Pounds 9.4m as more
oil was traded and pumped through its pipelines and terminals.
Mr Miller said there was more activity in the Canadian oil industry which
should mean more is discovered and pumped through the group's pipelines.
The defence division saw an increase in operating profit from Pounds 3.53m
to Pounds 5.24m, helped by Hunting-BRAE, its 51 per cent subsidiary that has
the AWE contract.
Without this contract, the defence business would have been flat or slightly
down. Mr Miller said that even though there was unlikely to be much relief
from delayed contracts in the latest government spending round, Hunting's
defence business would be 'basically stable for a year or two'.
With the AWE contract, however, and a recently won parachute contract, the
division should move 'nicely in the right direction'.
Gearing ended the period at 36 per cent, lower than the group had
anticipated. Mr Miller said that even with a build-up in working capital for
the AWE contract, gearing would end the year at a maximum of 40-60 per cent,
depending on the timing of MoD payments.
Earnings per share rose from 7.1p to 8.3p; the interim dividend is
maintained at 4p.

FT  15 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Wetherspoon jumps to Pounds 4.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JD WETHERSPOON, the Lon-don pub chain which was floated last October,
celebrated its first anniversary by reporting a doubling in profits,
excluding the effect of property disposals.
Pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 4.17m in the year to July 31, compared with
Pounds 2.08m last time. However, under FRS 3, last year's figure was reduced
to Pounds 926,000, reflecting a write-down caused by the sale of six pubs
before the group's flotation. Sales expanded 44 per cent to Pounds 30.8m.
Mr Tim Martin, chairman, said the 44 pubs in the group at the time of
flotation had performed well in a difficult trading environment. The group
had opened a further 23 pubs between then and the end of July, which had all
exceeded budgets and were trading profitably after finance charges since
opening.
He said: 'Although bar sales were down 1 per cent on a like-for-like basis,
catering - which accounts for 12 per cent of turnover - increased sales by
27 per cent, being particularly strong in recently opened venues.' Mr Martin
said the group's all-day menu, which offered food from 11am to 10pm, had
proved a great success.
The creation of smoke-free areas in the group's pubs, averaging about a
third of each venue, had also been well received.
The group will open 20 more pubs in the current year. Mr Martin said the
huge success of a pub opened in Croydon had encouraged the group to look for
good provincial sites. It had recently acquired a pub in Norwich, had
planning permission for a new outlet in Reading and was interested in
expanding into the Midlands.
Earnings per share were 14.7p, a rise of 18.5 per cent on the pro-forma
figure in the prospectus. Under FRS 3, the comparative figure is 5.8p. A
proposed final dividend of 3.6p gives a total of 5.4p (2.4p).
COMMENT
JD Wetherspoon's shares, unchanged yesterday at 341p, have more than doubled
since last year's flotation at 160p. That partly reflects enthusiasm for the
group's strong marketing skills, and partly the market's growing support for
small companies. The confidence and success with which Mr Martin has
introduced features such as no-smoking areas suggest that he retains a close
grip on which his customers want. Analysts like the company, but are divided
as to whether the shares have risen far enough for the time being. Forecast
earnings of Pounds 5.8m put the shares on a prospective multiple of 18, a
healthy premium to the market. They may not race ahead in the short term,
but on a longer view should reflect the group's strong growth prospects.

FT  15 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Restructure and new owners for Quiligotti
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QUILIGOTTI is proposing a restructuring and cash injection which is likely
to lead to a change in control at the Stockport-based terrazzo tile and
industrial flooring company.
The proposals also include the acquisition of Chelsea Artisans and
Microfloor.
The moves follow results for the year to March 31 showing pre-tax losses
widening from Pounds 1.83m to Pounds 3.3m. The loss meant that net assets
fell to Pounds 1.5m, in breach of banking covenants. Borrowings at the
period-end were Pounds 2.3m, with the expectation that they would rise to a
seasonal peak of Pounds 3.5m this month.
Turnover was Pounds 15.2m (Pounds 19.7m). The pre-tax figure was struck
after exceptional costs of Pounds 1.2m (Pounds 280,000). Losses per share
came out at 4.4p (5.8p).
The USM-quoted shares, suspended on September 29 awaiting the announcement,
resumed trading, falling  3/4 p to close at 1 1/2 p.
Under a placing and open offer 252m shares are being placed by Strand
Associates at 1 1/4 p. Some 109m of the shares are offered to shareholders
on a 3-for-2 basis at the same price.
To enable the offer to proceed, existing 5p shares will be divided into  1/2
p ordinary and 4 1/2 p deferred shares.
As a result of the moves Strand, a private investment company formed in
March, and its associates could hold up to 78.4 per cent of the enlarged
capital. If the shareholders take up their full entitlement they would hold
53.9 per cent.
Chelsea Artisans and Microfloor are managed by Mr James Walton, who becomes
chief executive of the larger group, and Mr Jeremy Brassington, who becomes
a non-executive director.
The total consideration is Pounds 150,000, satisfied by the issue of shares,
plus the discharge of shareholder loans of Pounds 150,000 and bank loans of
Pounds 275,000.

FT  15 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Pounds 50m tag for Crest Packaging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MARKET value in excess of Pounds 50m is expected when Crest Packaging's
flotation is priced at the end of this month. The listing will be by way of
an institutional placing and no new money is being raised by the company.
Four directors and their families own all the shares at present, and will
sell 25 per cent. Mr Rodney Webb, managing director, and his family
currently hold 85 per cent of the shares, which will fall to 64 per cent
after the float.
The company was formed by a management buy-out from Bowater in 1985. It
later acquired its 18 acre site and sold 8 acres to Tesco for Pounds 21.3m,
a profit of Pounds 12.7m before tax. Part of the proceeds were paid to
Bowater.
The sale transformed the balance sheet, which now carries cash of Pounds
10m.
The group made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 4.89m on sales of Pounds 41.8m in
the year to April 30. Pro-forma earnings per share were 8.04p. A dividend
cover of about 2 times is expected, to give a yield of 3 or 4 per cent, in
line with the sector.
Crest has two broad product lines - flexible packaging which contributed 70
per cent of operating profits in 1993, and cartons which made the balance.
Mr Webb said there had been capacity constraints holding back turnover
growth which were being addressed by increasing capacity by 20 per cent over
the next year.
Pricing will be announced on October 28 and dealings are due to start on
November 4.

<TEXT>
THE FIRST investment trust launch by Henderson Touche Remnant, the recently
merged fund management group, has proved a success with the Pounds 100m
offer for subscription of HTR Japanese Smaller Companies Trust being
oversubscribed.
The amount raised, viewed in the light of the recent Pounds 60m flotation of
Fleming's Chinese trust and the Pounds 67m raised by Schroder's emerging
markets unit trust, indicates the healthy state of the collective funds
sector.
Henderson raised Pounds 75m via a placing for its trust with the Pounds 25m
coming from an offer for subscription. Dealings in the shares will start on
October 22.

Pounds 450,000 for inventory and equipment and Pounds 550,000 for
outstanding orders.
In the 1992 year, Nieuwburg achieved turnover of Fl 4.38m (Pounds 1.6m) and

FT  15 OCT 93 / UK Company News: BNB advances to Pounds 344,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BNB Resources, the executive search and selection, training and consumer
advertising group, lifted pre-tax profits from a depressed Pounds 53,000 to
Pounds 344,000 in the six months to June 30. Turnover edged ahead from
Pounds 31.2m to Pounds 31.8m.
Mr David Norman, chairman, described the results as 'an encouraging
recovery' and pointed out that all three operating divisions improved their
performances.
Specifically, the human resources recruitment side, which accounts for about
two thirds of group turnover, increased profits - on improved margins - by
30 per cent to Pounds 1.77m (Pounds 1.37m).
Mr Norman said there had been a 'modest overall advance' in the senior
management and professional recruitment market. He said that this was a sign
of 'a growing economy' - management are usually hired and put in place prior
to, and in preparation for, the coming upturn, whereas activity in the
volume recruitment sector lags behind the recovery. This remained depressed
and the outlook flat.
Revenues at Norman Broadbent, the headhunter, rose 51 per cent, while they
were up 29 per cent at NB Selection, which advertises for candidates only in
the UK. Income at NBI in the US grew 50 per cent and a third US office was
opened in Chicago.
The US represented 'a substantial opportunity', said Mr Norman, and the Far
East, where NBI Hong Kong opened an office in Beijing, was 'very important
to us'.
Cost cutting measures in the training division helped reduce its seasonal
losses to Pounds 460,000 (Pounds 582,000) in spite of depressed volumes and
margin pressure, and Mr Norman said there had been a 10 per cent increase in
first-year chartered courses - the first rise for three years.
Losses were also cut in regional communications, the consumer advertising
business, which had been 'tough, very tough'.
Earnings expanded to 1.1p (0.1p) per share and the interim dividend is held
at 1.6p. Mr Norman expected that, unlike last year, the full-year pay-out
would be covered.

FT  15 OCT 93 / New products help Chrysler to record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Chrysler, the US car giant, surged by Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 51
3/4 yesterday as strong sales growth took third-quarter earnings to a record
Dollars 423m (Pounds 280m) - more than double the Dollars 202m for the
comparable period last year.
The profits increase was helped by exceptional gains of Dollars 58m from the
sale of Chrysler's remaining 23.3m shares in Mitsubishi Motors, the Japanese
car company, and a favourable tax adjustment of Dollars 51m. But the figures
also included a Dollars 79m charge for the restructuring of the group's car
rental operations.
Chrysler's healthy performance reflects continuing recovery from a position
of financial weakness two years ago. Earlier this month the company regained
its investment-grade debt rating from Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit
rating agency.
Chrysler has increased market share and profits by switching from the dull,
boxy cars it produced in the 1980s to more imaginative designs with higher
margins, such as sports utility vehicles and minivans.
Mr Robert Eaton, chairman, said a combination of new vehicles such as the
Jeep Grand Cherokee, Dodge Intrepid, Chrysler Concorde and Eagle Vision had
combined with continued dominance of the minivan market to improve the sales
mix.
Turnover for the quarter was a record Dollars 9.7bn, up 5.4 per cent.
Earnings per common share were Dollars 1.13, compared with 62 cents.
Retail sales in the quarter totalled 220,922 cars and 309,979 trucks and
minivans in the US and Canada, giving the group 9.4 per cent of the car
market and 20.2 per cent of the truck market. Its combined North American
market share was 13.6 per cent - 1.1 percentage points more than in the same
period last year.
International retail sales rose by 84 per cent to 30,676 units. Of these,
17,130 were sold in Europe, an increase of 48 per cent. The gain follows the
introduction of the Jeep Grand Cherokee in European markets and the opening
of a minivan assembly plant in Austria.
For the first nine months of 1993, Chrysler's net loss totals Dollars
3.045bn compared with net earnings of Dollars 367m. A charge of Dollars
4.683bn was taken earlier in the year to cover a change in accounting for
retiree healthcare.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Body Shop's recovery beats forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BODY Shop International, the natural cosmetics and toiletries manufacturer
and retailer, is reaping the benefits of its tighter grip on the business
with interim pre-tax profits up from Pounds 8.3m to Pounds 10m, ahead of
market expectations of Pounds 9m to Pounds 9.3m. The shares rose 13p to
188p.
Balance sheet gearing fell from 53 to 24 per cent, at the end of August,
with net debt at Pounds 21.6m.
Body Shop has also sold its 65.6 per cent stake in Eastwick Trading, which
operates franchised shops in the Benelux countries and Austria, for Pounds
2.1m. Dr Jan Oosterwijk, who runs Eastwick, has resigned from the board but
will remain a consultant.
It is also paying Pounds 3.86m to end the earn-out for management of its
Cos-Tec cosmetic manufacturing subsidiary, acquired in 1991. Mr Gordon
Roddick, chairman, said the earn-out was raising conflicts and it would be
cheaper to buy it out now rather than later.
Mr Gordon Roddick, chairman, said the results reflected growth in the
international business and 'an improving trading pattern in the UK'.
The interim dividend is being raised by 10 per cent to 0.75p, which he said
indicated the group's confidence that 'we think we know where we are going'.
He added: 'I am happier today than I was a year ago.' Then the group issued
a profit warning and the shares fell heavily.
Mr Roddick said Mr Geoff Marshall, appointed UK retail director in May, had
made a significant impact in a short time, introducing new products and
organising the business better.
Like-for-like sales were down 5 per cent in the UK in the first half, but
this was lower than the 8 per cent seen in the second half of the previous
year and was continuing to improve. Budgets for this Christmas season assume
flat comparable sales.
UK sales rose 6.9 per cent to Pounds 37.4m, although price increases were
'minimal' and operating profits were up 5 per cent to Pounds 3.9m. The group
opened four shops in the UK, taking the total to 237. The small increase
'signals the transition of the Body Shop into a mature retailer in the UK,'
Mr Roddick said.
The chain was approaching 'critical mass' in the US with 140 shops. Sales
there rose 77.7 per cent to Pounds 19.9m and operating profits were up from
Pounds 800,000 to Pounds 1.3m. Sales from the rest of the world rose 21.4
per cent to Pounds 25.5m, with operating profits up 8 per cent to Pounds
5.5m. Interest charges fell from Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 700,000. Earnings per
share were 3.4p, up from 2.9p.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Prices squeeze deflates Smurfit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
JEFFERSON Smurfit, the Irish paper and packaging group with operations
throughout Europe and the Americas, yesterday reported a 16 per cent decline
in interim pre-tax profits which it blamed on 'continuing price erosion' and
some volume reductions.
Pre-tax profits fell from IPounds 60.3m (Pounds 57.9m) to IPounds 50.7m in
the six months to July 31. Sales rose from IPounds 654m to IPounds 749.5m,
reflecting the inclusion of UK Corrugated, Cundell and Irish Paper Products
for the first time.
Earnings per share dropped by 18.7 per cent to 7.4p (9.1p) but the directors
declared an unchanged interim dividend of 1.2306p. The shares slipped 8p to
close at 214p.
Mr Michael Smurfit, chairman, said the results 'continue to reflect both the
severity of the current world recession and the state of our industry'.
Trading profits dropped to IPounds 39.5m, from IPounds 59.3m, but the
decline was partly offset by a quadrupling of net interest receipts to
IPounds 11.6m. Since the year-end, net cash declined from IPounds 150m to
IPounds 24m, aggravated by currency devaluation.
Mr Ray Curran, chief financial officer, said that Latin America had again
been the 'mainstay'. Operating profits there slipped to IPounds 28.5m
(IPounds 30.6m) but the region increased its share of overall profits from
53 to 73 per cent.
The deepening recession in continental Europe resulted in lost volumes in
all operations with prices deteriorating as the group struggled to maintain
market share. Sales fell by 13 per cent and profits dropped by 41 per cent
to IPounds 9.67m.
The newly combined Ireland/UK region had a difficult first half mainly
because of a 'disappointing performance' by the UK print and carton
companies. Corrugated volumes in the UK were higher but that was more than
offset by lower prices. Despite a slight profit increase in Ireland, the
combined region posted a 20 per cent decline in operating profits to IPounds
11.5m.
JSC/CCA, the US associate, suffered from the sluggish economy and excessive
paperboard inventories, while improving newsprint demand had yet to lift
prices. Losses attributable to the US operations increased from IPounds
4.06m to IPounds 10.7m.
The US associate has announced plans for a Dollars 150m (Dollars 100m after
tax) rationalisation programme which is likely to result in the group taking
an IPounds 25m exceptional charge.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Write-downsat ADT and Attwoods hit Laidlaw
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LAIDLAW, the North American waste services and transport operator, has
cleared the way for the disposal or rationalisation of its interests in ADT,
the international security and vehicle auction group, and Attwoods, the
UK-based waste services company.
The group has sharply written down the carrying value of its investments in
the two companies.
The write-down of the 24 per cent stake in ADT and the 35 per cent interest
in Attwoods totalled USDollars 243.8m (Pounds 161.4m). Laidlaw is the
largest single shareholder in both companies.
The moves were part of a house-cleaning exercise which appears to signal a
more active role in Laidlaw's affairs by its Montreal-based controlling
shareholder, Canadian Pacific.
Laidlaw also named Mr Jim Bullock as chief executive to replace Mr Donald
Jackson, who was asked to resign last week. Mr Bullock was formerly
president of Cadillac Fairview, a large Toronto-based property developer.
The write-downs pushed Laidlaw to a loss of USDollars 334.9m, or Dollars
1.21 a share, in the fourth quarter to August 31, compared with net income
of Dollars 24.9m, or 9 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenues rose 10 per cent to Dollars 467.5m but income from continuing
operations dipped to Dollars 3.9m from Dollars 24.9m.
Laidlaw also set aside Dollars 105m to cover closures, delays and falling
values at several landfill and hazardous waste facilities in the US and
Canada.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Trio search for trump card in a rough game: Leyla Boulton
explains a new alliance between Russian banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The unprecedented alliance between three Russian banks, announced this week,
is a logical response to the country's glaring need to consolidate its
banking sector.
Russia has nearly 2,000 banks, with 100 accounting for two-thirds of all
banking business. Most of the rest are badly under-capitalised, and the
central bank has tried to get them to merge with bigger banks by raising
minimum capital requirements.
This week, Izvestia newspaper revealed that the central bank had suspended
the operations of 22 troubled Moscow banks with names such as
Kredit-Consensus and Glory Save-Bank.
It is no surprise, then, that the central bank has welcomed the planned
alliance between Bank Imperial, Yugorsky Bank and Rossiisski Kredit, three
of the stronger fledglings.
Some of the impetus for consolidation may have come from an injection of
foreign competition. The central bank this summer granted licences to half a
dozen foreign banks to create Russian subsidiaries.
But Mr Sergei Rodionov, the chairman of Bank Imperial, denies that the
proposed alliance is in response to foreign competition. 'I welcome the
arrival of foreign banks. They will be bored here because they will have
nothing to do,' he told the Financial Times.
'But they will disseminate western banking culture, which, like a woman's
perfume, will make it more pleasant to work here.'
The new accord - under which the three banks will pool their financial
resources into a 'single credit institution with common management' - falls
short of a merger because each will retain a separate legal identity. But
the main aim is to combine the complementary strengths of the three banks,
while reducing their overheads and tax bills. The combined assets of a group
specialising in two of Russia's most lucrative markets, energy and foreign
exchange, total about Rbs2,000bn (Pounds 1.05bn).
The biggest shareholders in Imperial, a wholesale bank for some 400 clients
in the energy business, are state-owned energy companies, such as Gasprom,
the gas-producing monopoly which is also a client of the bank. Yugorsky Bank
is owned by big state-controlled oil producers and finances oil projects.
The attraction of Rossiisski Kredit, which makes most of its money from
various forms of arbitrage on Russia's distorted foreign exchange market, is
its retail network.
'One of our clients, for instance, wanted to open bank accounts for their
employees working abroad so they could receive salaries in hard currency
here, but Imperial does not want to mess around setting up 3,000 private
bank accounts,' explains Mr Rodionov. The alliance will inevitably
strengthen the participants against any increased competition that may
result from creeping restructuring of the Russian banking sector.
Imperial also has a banking presence in the west. It holds a 36 per cent
stake in Luxembourg's East-West Bank, with another 51 per cent held by the
Russian Central Bank, after the Luxembourg authorities said that Imperial
could not hold the majority stake.
Some Russian banks are preparing for increased competition by organising
alliances with foreign banks. Russia's biggest bank, Tokobank, is planning
to set up a joint venture bank with Turkey's Yapi ve Kredi Bankasi.
Other Russian banks, particularly those that fear their prized hard currency
deposits will be 'stolen' by foreign banks, have preferred to lobby for
protection against them. But the dissolution of the Russian parliament,
which had threatened to ban foreign banks from taking deposits from Russian
customers, deprived them of a crucial ally.
Mr Rodionov, however, dismisses Russian banks' fears of foreign competition
as 'an artificial problem'. He says foreign banks will not succeed in
encroaching on his market share because they are totally 'unfamiliar with
our economy'.
'They are used to lending money to companies which have been audited and so
on. But auditors here will approve any balance sheet, no matter what is
written on it. Our country is one big trust. Everything depends on whom you
know.'
A former head of the Russian central bank's supervision department, the
32-year-old Mr Rodionov is adept at working around tax and foreign currency
regulations which he describes as self-defeating. A gamekeeper turned
poacher who is perfectly at home in the murky world of Russian business, he
recognises the need for improved banking supervision.
There are serious gaps in Russian banking legislation - for instance, there
is no effective limit on industrial and commercial companies taking stakes
in banks, or on clients becoming shareholders in their banks. Nor are the
authorities tackling visible problems such as fraudulent advertising by
banks.
But while welcoming new central bank rules providing for uniform accounting
standards, Mr Rodionov says the central bank's 'draconian' foreign exchange
regulations only encourage capital flight. Taxation is so high that banks,
including his own, have no choice but to avoid it as best they can. 'I have
many ways of keeping my shareholders happy without showing such a high
profit. I can for instance increase the interest rates paid on their
deposits.'
His candour is a sign of just how far Russian banks have become a 'state
within a state'. One reason for this state of affairs is the authorities'
inability to protect bankers from extortion rackets. At least 10 bankers
have been killed this year. Mr Rodionov says that 60 of his 160 staff are
security people.
Many banks are connected to mafia-style organisations. Mr Rodionov said that
the supervision chief at the central bank had his hand smashed and his
country house set on fire after he tried to conduct an investigation into a
'major Moscow commercial bank'. 'The investigation stopped there,' he said.
This illustrates the scale of the challenges facing the central bank, which
has lost much of its best staff, including Mr Rodionov, to the commercial
sector where pay and morale are incomparably higher.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Dispute at Timex ends in disarray with Pounds 1m cash offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EIGHT-MONTH Timex dispute in Dundee finally ended yesterday in disarray,
amid the anger and tears of the workforce.
By a narrow vote of 132 to 108, with 63 absent, the former employees backed
a redundancy cash offer negotiated between the AEEU engineering and
electrical union and the company. The deal settles one of the most bitter
disputes in Britain for many years.
In return for accepting Pounds 1m of severance money, the workers agreed
that all unfair dismissal claims against Timex should be dropped by today
and a worldwide trade union boycott of the company's products ended.
'The strike is over,' said Mr Jimmy Airlie, the AEEU's national officer in
Scotland. The Pounds 200,000 strike support fund is also to be disbursed on
a 'fair and equitable basis' among the former workers, so that it can no
longer be used to harass Timex.
If the 340 unfair dismissal cases are not withdrawn today from the
industrial tribunal, Timex has said that the redundancy cash offer will be
withdrawn as part of the settlement.
It was unclear last night whether the Timex workers who voted against the
deal would accept the verdict and end their unfair dismissal claims.
Mr Airlie said: 'I am confident the workers will accept the democratic
majority verdict. If they do not then none of them will receive any
redundancy money at all. They will get nothing.'
He told a mass meeting of former workers earlier in the day that the union
was no longer prepared to carry on with the strike.
He informed them that it was ending immediately the Pounds 30-a-week strike
pay they had been receiving since February and that no further legal aid,
nor union representation, would be available for those who wanted to
continue unfair dismissal cases.
Mr Airlie said the union had already spent about Pounds 500,000 on the
strike since it began in February, when Timex dismissed all its manual
employees and hired a substitute workforce.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Pravda told to change its name and editor: Moscow sets terms
before newspaper can reappear

PRAVDA, Russia's best-known Communist newspaper, is to be allowed back on
the streets on condition it changes its name and editor, while the ex-KGB,
another former pillar of Communist power, is to improve its spying on
political parties.
Both measures were announced as the Russian authorities prepare to lift
emergency rule in Moscow on Monday.
The press and information ministry also said 15 newspapers suspended after
President Boris Yeltsin crushed the armed parliamentary rebellion on October
4 would be closed permanently.
These included the hardline Den (Day) and smaller fascist or nationalist
newspapers. The St Petersburg television programme, 600 Seconds, vitriolic
in its opposition to the country's rulers, has also been taken off the air
for good.
Mr Gennady Seleznev, Pravda's editor, dismissed the ultimatum for him to
step down as 'crude and arbitrary'.
Itar-Tass, the official Russian news agency, said Pravda would 'in all
likelihood come out under the name Path of Truth'. The agency did not say
whether the government had chosen the new name.
Another popular Communist newspaper, Sovietskaya Rossiya, has been given
similar instructions as a condition for its reappearance. Its staff rejected
the demand for its editor's sacking as 'blackmail and a violation of media
laws'.
Itar-Tass quoted a ministry official as saying: 'Nobody is asking them to
stop their activity as opposition newspapers, but from now on they must act
in a civilised manner and not break the law.'
Mr Nikolai Golushko, the head of the security ministry, admitted that his
organisation had been poorly prepared for the uprising and cited this as
justification for 'improved supervision of political parties' in future.
At least eight communist and nationalist parties were banned under the state
of emergency and are likely to remain so even though some individual party
leaders will be allowed to stand in parliamentary elections due on December
12.
Mr Sergei Shakhrai, the deputy prime minister and previously close to Mr
Yeltsin, announced he would hold a founding meeting of his new Russian Party
for Unity and Agreement today. His party will not join Russia's Choice, an
electoral bloc set up by leading pro-Yeltsin reformers in Moscow.
Mr Shakhrai said his party wanted to avoid radicalism in economic policy and
would put up mostly regional leaders, rather than members of Moscow's
political elite, as its parliamentary candidates.

FT  15 OCT 93 / US refuses to reopen Blair House deal on farm exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL and QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US yesterday moved strongly to distance itself from French pressure to
reopen US-EC talks on subsidised farm exports, suggesting the matter was an
internal European issue.
In what appeared to be a mediation effort, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the German
economics minister, outlined possible areas for compromise, although German
officials denied reports from France that Chancellor Helmut Kohl would try
personally to reconcile the two countries.
Mr Rexrodt said it could prove fatal to hopes of a solution by mid-December
for any side to raise obstacles at this late stage. His appeal was clearly
directed as much at France, which has suggested that both agricultural trade
and audiovisual services should be left out of the Gatt accord, as at the
US.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, insisted that the US would
neither reopen nor renegotiate the year-old Blair House agreement limiting
Europe's subsidised farm exports.
He was cool towards EC proposals for a special summit next week of trade
ministers from the Quad group, which is made up of Canada, the EC, the US
and Japan. A summit 'would only be useful if substantive progress is made in
the meanwhile. Reiteration of statements would be counter-productive', he
said.
Mr Kantor drummed his point home by appearing with Mr Peter Cook, the
Australian trade minister, who was also in Brussels representing the
14-nation Cairns Group of farm exporters. 'There are more countries involved
in this negotiation than the Quad, or US-EC bilateral talks,' he said.
Mr Kantor made an even more direct gesture in France's direction by
accepting an invitation to dinner in Brussels last night with a French
delegation headed by Mr Gerard Longuet, France's industry minister, and one
of the few French ministers to have spoken out openly in favour of a
successful Uruguay Round result by the end of the year.
Discussions yesterday centred on steel and aircraft subsidies, where Mr
Kantor said progress had been made, even though the US and the EC 'did not
come to complete agreement'. But the US trade representative was emphatic
that an EC offer on tariff cuts in manufactured goods, to be unveiled
formally in Geneva at the beginning of next week, was unsatisfactory. He
insisted that deeper tariff cuts on manufactured goods were needed for the
EC's proposed Quad meeting.
EC officials nevertheless remained optimistic that the Quad ministers would
eventually agree to a meeting.
Mr Rexrodt also called for concessions from the US on dismantling peak
tariffs for textile imports, and firm pledges on market access for financial
services and marine transport. In return, he said, Germany was ready to
plead in Brussels for an extension of the EC's offer on market access in
Europe.
One EC spokesman said the US negotiators had not been expected to arrive in
Brussels with any fresh initiatives. He said this was partly due to pressure
on US trade negotiators to secure backing in Congress for the North American
Free Trade Agreement.

FT  15 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Body Shop
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears that the Body Shop's franchise would be undermined by a mix of copycat
commodity products and changing consumer fashions have tarnished the
company's star rating. Yet if the recent UK performance is any guide, Body
Shop may yet regain a dull shine. Declines in like-for-like sales have
slowed substantially as the company has focused on basic selling skills.
Even in a market which has had time to become tired of the idea, solid
retailing ideas may help Body Shop hold out against competition such as
Boots' Natural Collection.
That offers hope for the international expansion of the chain, since Body
Shop also faces generic competition in overseas markets - most notably in
the US. Perhaps the main issue here, however, is the company's ability to
manage the logistics of a global business with 1,000 franchise outlets. Part
of the explanation for international profits rising more slowly than sales
is said to be that the company is investing in the structure of the
business. A further bolstering of the management team in this area might
also reassure.
As Body Shop has fallen back to a rating broadly comparable with the market,
its appeal rests on the prospect of growth from its international
operations. That in turn depends upon the strength of the brand and its
continuing capacity to maintain premium pricing. Even mighty Philip Morris
has worries on that score, so Body Shop still has reason to be cautious.

FT  15 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Jefferson Smurfit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cardboard boxes provide little shelter when the chill winds blow, as
Jefferson Smurfit's 33 per cent fall in interim trading profits exemplifies.
The length and severity of the current downturn have made this a paper cycle
like no other. Demand in Europe and the US has remained depressed and even
where volume increases have been achieved they have been more than offset by
falling prices. Ireland may be picking up. The UK, though, remains anaemic,
while recession in Germany and France has deepened. The supply side is
little better. With the US awash with finance, even weak paper companies,
which may have perished in previous downturns, have been able to refinance
to keep excess capacity alive. Yet few companies have been strong enough to
endure the financial pain of shutting capacity themselves. Smurfit is lucky
to have its Latin American operations to keep it whistling by contributing
73 per cent of trading profits. Even here, however, conditions are likely to
soften in the second half.
But Smurfit is not a case of hope abandoned so much as of hope again
deferred. Yesterday's 4 per cent share price fall perhaps reflects little
more than lack of patience. Like all paper companies, Smurfit badly needs a
firmer upswing in the economic cycle - or at least a dose of inflation. A
bonus should come from the flotation of JSC, its leveraged US associate. But
this, too, will have to wait for the upturn.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
While the giants of the UK drugs industry are out of favour, the pigmies are
winning friends. Not all are biotechnology companies in the strictest sense.
But it matters little that Scotia - which raised Pounds 40m yesterday - is
working with fatty acids rather than large proteins. Like British
Bio-technology last year and Celltech next month, it is issuing shares to
finance the development of drugs which are some years from the market. The
latest spate of offerings owes much to the relaxation of stock exchange
rules demanding a three year profits record.
There is no evidence that small companies are better at steering drugs
through development. Biotechnology drugs often command high prices, so the
threat of government regulation - such as President Clinton's proposed
National Health Board - is just as real. Diagnostic products arguably face
lower regulatory hurdles, but that is no guarantee of commercial success.
Drew Scientific, the diagnostics company which floated in May, has already
issued its first profits warning. The gamble is that just one in a portfolio
of small biotechnology stocks will have sufficient scientific and commercial
skills to outweigh those that fall by the wayside.
The 30 per cent fall in the US biotechnology sector this year argues for
caution. There has been a handful of spectacular successes, but more
disappointments than anticipated when the biotechnology bandwagon rolled
down Wall Street in 1990. Many US companies which raised funds then are
thirsty for more. With their home market in sceptical mood, the new-found
enthusiasm of UK investors must look too good an opportunity to miss.

The foreign exchange market appears to be losing patience with European
countries that dawdle over cutting interest rates. While the Spanish peseta
was resilient in the face of yesterday's half point cut in money rates, the
French and Belgian francs have come under pressure. According to
conventional wisdom, the exchange markets will soon force these countries to
crack. Unless they cut their interest rates below those in Germany,
recession will swell their budget deficits uncontrollably. Paradoxically,
lower interest rates, which would alleviate this risk, might actually
strengthen their currencies.
Yet there is a large difference with the situation at the end of July when
the French franc was at its floor in the ERM. Now the D-Mark could rise
another 36 centimes before the resolve of the authorities to defend its
wide-band limits would be tested. The Belgian franc is more vulnerable as
long as the country has no social pact, but a similar argument applies.
Currency speculators are not remotely in sight of the substantial short-term
gains which drove them into such a frenzy in July.
As long as they continue to believe German rates will fall reasonably soon,
the French authorities, and probably the Belgians too, may still consider
temporary currency weakness preferable to an open severance of their link to
German policy. A belief that this link is paramount for long-term
credibility on inflation would explain their behaviour since the August
crisis. It is cold comfort to British exporters who are looking for signs of
economic life on the continent to fill up their order books.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Tremors on the television  The Bell Atlantic-TCI merger
reflects US faith in the new age of multi-media communications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A year of ever-increasing seismic rumblings in the US telecommunications
industry culminated on Wednesday in an earthquake of colossal proportions
which promises to transform the sector and give America a powerful push
towards the long-heralded 'information age'.
Bell Atlantic, the most innovative of the nation's giant 'Baby Bell' local
telephone companies, announced plans to buy Tele-Communications Inc, the
largest and most aggressive of the cable companies which pipe dozens of
television channels into American homes. The agreed deal could end up worth
more than Dollars 20bn - or more than Dollars 30bn with TCI's debt added in.
Underpinning the deal is the belief that the combined forces of a telephone
company and a cable company will be far better placed to exploit the new age
of multi-media, interactive television than the two businesses acting alone.
This is not in itself a new idea. In the UK, which has one of the world's
most liberal regulatory environments, cable and telephone companies
(including three Baby Bells) are already co-operating to build networks
offering combined cable TV and telephone services.
In the US, the earth tremors which preceded this week's deal came from other
Baby Bells taking stakes in the cable industry. Southwestern Bell is
spending Dollars 650m on two cable systems in the Washington area, while US
West has spent Dollars 2.5bn buying a 25 per cent stake in Time Warner's
cable and entertainment business.
What is different, and important, about the Bell Atlantic deal is its scale
and scope. By bringing together two of the largest and most aggressive
players in their respective industries, it would create the first
multi-media company with a national reach.
And the fact that it is a full merger, rather than a loose alliance, should
give the new Bell Atlantic greater management, technological and financial
resources than most of its rivals to invest in creating a multi-media
communications network - the 'information superhighways of the 21st century'
 -and a powerful national brand name.
It is hardly surprising, then, that Mr Raymond Smith, the chairman of Bell
Atlantic, should immodestly describe the deal as a 'perfect information age
marriage' and 'a model for communications companies in the next century'.
Indeed, it is expected to set off a rush of takeovers of cable companies by
the Baby Bells and some of the larger independent local phone companies
scattered across the US, such as GTE.
However, the TCI takeover also raises some huge questions about the emerging
multi-media world.
First, it would blow a big hole in the already crumbling regulatory wall
erected by Washington between the US cable/entertainment and telephone
industries. How much concentration of power - either horizontally between
service providers or vertically with entertainment originators - should the
federal government's anti-monopoly watchdogs sanction? And how much is
commercially sensible?
Second, to what extent will this deal, and any copycat ones, give other
countries a push towards the introduction of multi-media services, and the
US a global competitive advantage in supplying them?
'The principal asset this company will have is leadership,' says Mr John
Malone, chief executive of TCI. 'I think it will be the leader of the
industry on a worldwide basis.'
Third, how much demand really exists for the brave new world of interactive
multi-media when many consumers have trouble programming a video recorder or
keeping track of the choices offered on a few dozen existing channels?
Behind the frenzy of deal-making in the US telecoms and entertainment
industries lies a technological revolution which is causing the phone, media
and computer industries to converge in one giant sector, often called
'communicopia'.
This is multi-media in nature because video, audio and data information can
all be transformed into the same digital form and transmitted in vast
quantities down modern fibre-optic cables to television terminals in homes,
offices or mobile telephones. It is interactive because powerful
microprocessors and sophisticated software embedded in the system are
allowing the consumer to send more and more information back down the line.
The day is not far off, insist communicopia evangelists, when someone
sitting at home will be able to call up hundreds of channels of television,
pay bank charges, or summon a movie at the press of a remote control button.
More sophisticated uses could include contacting a friend in a distant city
on a video phone and going on a joint TV shopping trip, browsing through
video shopping catalogues together.
The two industries best placed to package and distribute these new services
are those which have existing wires going into US homes and offices - the
local telephone companies, which provide virtually universal coverage, and
the cable TV companies, which service some 60 per cent of US homes.
Until recently, the two sides appeared to be squaring up for a fight over
multi-media, but the spate of recent deals shows them recognising instead
that they have complementary strengths.
The cable companies understand programme packaging, and the coaxial cables
they send into homes can carry much more traffic than the telephone
companies' twisted copper. The phone companies have great financial
strength, together with expertise in switching traffic - which is vital to
the interactive part of the multi-media revolution.
Technical change, therefore, has given a compelling logic to the combination
of these two distribution industries, leaving the US regulatory framework
lagging behind.
It was only two years ago that the seven Baby Bells won a court case giving
them the right to enter the information and entertainment industry. They had
been banned from the sector, for fear of their monopoly power, under the
1984 anti-trust court settlement that spun off the Baby Bells from their
parent, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, which is restricted to the
long-distance market.
And the local phone companies are still banned from owning or buying video
services in the regions where they also provide a telephone service, under a
1984 act designed to protect cable companies.
However, in a landmark legal breakthrough, Bell Atlantic won a court case in
Virginia in August allowing it to offer a cable service in its own region,
on the grounds that the 1984 act violated the company's constitutional
rights to free speech. The case is under appeal, and does not apply to the
other Baby Bells, but it is a clear indication of the way the regulatory
winds are blowing.
It also gives added point to the deal with TCI. For while Bell Atlantic is
obliged to sell TCI's cable operations which overlap with its region, it
plans to set up new cable operations of its own, in competition with other
local cable companies. Outside its own region, the new Bell Atlantic will
also help TCI set up telephone operations, in competition with other Baby
Bells.
In other words, the deal envisages a world where two or more combined
cable/telecommunications companies in each region will vie with one another
to supply customers with multi-media services. Says Bell Atlantic's Mr
Smith: 'I believe that when the regulators and Congress look at it they will
see it is very competitive.'
That is a moot point. While the Justice Department, which oversees
anti-trust issues, and the Federal Communications Commission, which sets the
detailed rules for the industry, may be fairly sanguine about the deal,
several leading Democratic congressmen see it as potentially
anti-competitive.
According to Mr Edward Markey, chairman of the House of Representatives
sub-committee on telecommunications and finance: 'Only through competition
between the cable and telephone industries can we hope to bring consumers
lower prices and greater choice.'
One important question is whether consumers will be offered a genuine choice
between competing multi-media companies in each region, but that may only
become clear as the revolution unfolds.
Another is whether the new distribution giants will have so much monopoly
power that they can act as 'gatekeepers' - forcing independent providers of
programmes to accept poor financial terms before distributing their products
to homes.
According to Mr Edward Fritts, president of the National Association of
Broadcasters, the monopoly power of the new Bell Atlantic and 'its ability
to discriminate against broadcasters and other non-affiliated programmers is
beyond all measure'.
These concerns have been heightened by a rush among both Baby Bells and
cable companies to form links vertically with programme producers - a trend
demonstrated clearly in the current battle for Paramount Communications, the
film and publishing group, and the Bell Atlantic deal.
QVC, which is making a hostile Dollars 9.5bn offer for Paramount, has
financial links with TCI and is rumoured to have been in talks with several
Bell companies about possible finance. A rival Dollars 7.5bn offer from
cable group Viacom has Dollars 1.2bn in backing from Nynex, the Baby Bell
serving the north-eastern US.
As part of the TCI deal, Bell Atlantic wants to buy an associated company
called Liberty Media, which has interests in several large cable programming
channels. Bell Atlantic boasts that it will create 'the world's premier
communications, information and entertainment company'. This general rush
into programming could end with the telephone and cable companies paying
high prices for creative assets which can walk out the door. And since cable
law mandates that programmers sell their wares to all comers, at market
prices, why is vertical integration so vital?
The answer from the multi-media industry is not entirely convincing: the
laws may change; a strong stream of in-house product allows greater
scheduling flexibility; and in the final analysis the prime determinant of a
service provider's success in the new age will be the quality of its
programmes, which in turn should ensure high profit margins for production
companies.
All this, however, still leaves a huge question mark as to whether consumers
want to pay for all these potential new services. The multi-media industry
is hoping that at the very least it will be able to attract revenues from
other large industries, such as the Dollars 50bn catalogue shopping sector
or the Dollars 12bn video rental market.
But the track record of some US experimental systems suggests that demand
could be very slow in developing. At Cerritos, in California, where GTE has
had a multi-media test running for four years, local enthusiasm for
interactive services appears muted.
However, this apparent reluctance to embrace the information age could
change rapidly if technology now in the pipeline makes the service much more
easy to use, and adds useful new services such as video telephones. Insists
Mr Smith: 'The fear that there is no demand for multi-media services is
totally misplaced. The surprise will be how fast the market develops.'
As for international markets, the TCI deal could give Bell Atlantic
something of an advantage over other US companies, though it remains to be
seen what other powerful alliances emerge in the wake of this deal.
Yet the formidable regulatory barriers faced by Bell Atlantic in the US are
small compared with those it would face in continental Europe, where
state-owned telephone companies have monopoly rights to voice services until
1998.
But despite all these hurdles, Mr Smith may well be right in his judgment
that 'the entire communications industry stands on the verge of a new growth
curve the like of which we have never seen'. At least he's betting Dollars
30bn on it.

Official visits by European heads of state are seldom cancelled at short
notice. All the more embarrassing, then, if the trip is supposed to
celebrate a landmark anniversary in diplomatic relations.
So a number of eyebrows were raised when President Suleyman Demirel of
Turkey decided to call off at the 11th hour a visit to mark the arrival in
London, 200 years ago, of the first Turkish ambassador. Apparently the
president, who was due in Britain this week, was upset to learn that neither
the prime minister nor any member of the royal family would be attending the
banquet he planned. His patience seems finally to have snapped when he was
informed that, should he wish to touch down in London later than 4pm, he
could not expect a red carpet welcome at the airport.
The Foreign Office swears that it is domestic concerns which prevent the
president from travelling abroad. An official did have to agree, however,
that the carpet impasse sounded 'very British'.

Precious few relics of 1968 have stood the test of time. But Time Out, the
London listings and reviews magazine which started life 25 years ago this
week, has lasted the course.
Always willing to tackle off-beat subjects, it also exhibits a fine sense of
self-irony by rerunning, in its own birthday publicity material, reminders
of some of the magazine's more spectacular howlers.
One was the 1990 guide to Sarajevo, which contained the immortal assessment:
'For the time being, the city's atmosphere of multicultural tolerance still

A year to the day since EC president Jacques Delors offered employment at a
wage of Ecu200,000 to anyone who could come up with a one-page explanation
of how subsidiarity might work, Observer discovers that no adjudication has
taken place.
The impossibility of the undertaking is undoubtedly underlined by Delors'
spokesman having personally received just two attempts. 'It was no doubt
taken as the plaisanterie it was,' he harrumphs.
But the silence from Brussels has disappointed one, prima facie excellently
qualified reader. Victor Ross, retired chairman of Reader's Digest, has been
bombarding Delors' office with requests about the progress of his
submission. Answer comes there none.
He does admit, however, that delegation of responsibility for the
acknowledgment of solicited mail below a certain level of competence was
perhaps an aspect of subsidiarity he should have considered in his own
entry.

As Jacques de Larosiere eases himself into the marbled splendour of the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the new president might
care to consider the history of the London site on which the building now
stands.
It was in 1247 that the priory of St Mary of Bethlehem outside Bishopsgate
was established, and, as Europe's second lunatic asylum after Granada in
Spain, began to take in lunatics 130 years later. Nedward, in The London Spy
of 1698, wrote of Bedlam, the familiar corruption of Bethlehem, ' 'tis an
almshouse for madmen, a showing room for harlots, a sure market for lechers,
a dry walk for loiterers'. By 1675, the hospital had outgrown its
accommodation and moved to Moorfields, whereupon the building was turned
into the capital's first workhouse.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When it comes to open government, Harold Wilson's celebrated kitchen cabinet
looks to have been a relatively loosely knit organisation compared with the
arrangements being made by Greece's new socialist premier Andreas
Papandreou.
Far from operating downstairs, his advisory network will reach into the
conjugal bedroom, with the appointment of his wife Dimitra to head his
private office.
It's true that the former Olympic Airways stewardess won't be on the
government payroll, and that she has denied having political ambitions. But
her influence is already showing, if socialist insiders are to be believed.
They claim she was behind the omission from the new official cabinet of
another female sharing the prime minister's surname, although not a relation
 -Vasso Papandreou, a former trade minister and EC commissioner. Her
exclusion certainly seems strange since not only did she get more votes in
last week's election than any other parliamentary candidate, but her
connections in Brussels could have helped the socialists to woo approval in
the European Commission.
On the other hand, one who did get a government job, as undersecretary for
culture and sport, is journalist George Lianis who, besides having won
popularity as a backbencher, happens to be Dimitra Papandreou's cousin. And
the junior minister in charge of relations with Greek communities overseas,
George Papandreou, is the prime minister's eldest son.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Multi-media superhighways
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AVERAGE telephone line in the US is used for only 20 minutes a day. For
the remaining 23 hours and 40 minutes, it is dead. This basic fact underlies
the current convergence between the telecommunications and cable television
industries, which was epitomised by this week's Dollars 22bn bid for
Tele-Communications, the largest US cable television group, by Bell
Atlantic, a large regional telecommunications carrier.
Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications believe that by combining forces they
will be able to sell customers a rich diet of services over a single
network: ordinary entertainment and telephone services to start with, but
eventually home shopping, access to databases, picture telephones and much
else. The same desire to fill the unused hours on the telephone lines with
extra services underlies recent multi-billion dollar investments in cable
television by US West and Nynex, two other US regional telecommunications
carriers.
There are those who are sceptical about the current enthusiasm for
'multi-media' convergence. They point out that attempts to merge
telecommunications and computing companies in the early 1980s failed because
it was impossible to devise products which appealed sufficiently to
customers. Similarly, it has yet to be proved that customers want to buy new
multi-media services.
Cost advantages
But the industrial logic driving the convergence of cable TV and
telecommunications does not rely on consumers showing interest in new and as
yet unproved multi-media services. There are cost advantages in combining
ordinary entertainment and telephone services over a single infrastructure.
This has already been shown in the UK, which has become a telecommunications
laboratory since deregulation in the mid-1980s. British cable TV companies
are successfully offering combined telephone and entertainment services at
lower prices than either service could be provided on its own.
If anything stops the convergence of the two industries, it will be
regulation rather than industrial logic. There are already signs that the
Bell Atlantic/TCI takeover will face tough scrutiny from the authorities.
The reason is concern among politicians and consumer groups that instead of
competing head-on, cable TV and telecommunications operators will join
forces and push up prices for both telephone and TV services.
This argument misses the point that cable TV and telecommunications
companies have in the past not competed at all. Regulations have kept them
out of each others' businesses, so creating local telephone and cable
monopolies. Now these regulations are crumbling. In August, for example,
Bell Atlantic won a legal case allowing it to provide video services over
its main telephone network.
Hasten competition
But barriers still largely remain on cable companies providing telephone
services over their networks. Rather than seeking to use regulations to slow
down convergence, the authorities should press ahead with deregulation as a
means of hastening competition in both industries.
There is one important caveat. Telecommunications operators should continue
to be prevented from linking up with cable companies operating in the areas
where they run telephone services. Such integration would be seriously
anti-competitive, as it would eliminate major potential competitors.
But allowing link-ups with cable companies outside the areas where they
provide telephone services is a different matter - particularly if combined
with a policy of freeing both cable and telecommunications groups to offer a
full range of services over their networks. Such an approach would
eventually mean that customers would have a choice between two integrated
fixed-link operators, instead of facing monopoly suppliers for two separate
services. Further competition will be provided by operators offering
television and telephone services via satellite and radio links.
Restructuring the industry in this way will have considerable benefits for
customers. Far from increasing prices, competition would drive them down.
Meanwhile, the industry would be able to bring the dead hours of the
telephone network to life.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Case for rail privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRIVATISATION of British Rail has been characterised by erstwhile
friends of the government as a 'privatisation too far'. It has few
enthusiastic proponents outside the ranks of cabinet ministers and their
political advisers. Rail commuters and other train users have no great
fondness for the often shambolic service that BR inflicts on its passengers.
But they find it hard to see privatisation as anything more than an attempt
to cut rail services and force fares up still further.
That is strange, for given the success of past privatisations, neither
outcome seems inevitable. Prices for telephones, gas and electricity have
fallen for many customers. In telecommunications, where privatisation has
released the strongest competition, new services are added to the existing
ones almost weekly.
It is true that water prices have risen since privatisation. But this has
more to do with tighter European Community water standards than private
ownership. Higher water bills would have been inevitable whatever the
industry's ownership (a point not readily grasped by the public after the
unwisely large pay rises for the directors of the privatised water
companies).
What is unarguable is that all the utilities have found it easier to raise
capital outside the public sector, free of Treasury constraints on
borrowing. Investment long-delayed under nationalisation has been funded
after privatisation. Regulation has increased competition and kept the lid
on price rises. The utilities have also improved their service standards,
addressing familiar complaints such as unreliability over home appointments.
Fiscal climate
Similar benefits cannot be guaranteed for rail privatisation. But they are
surely more likely than under public ownership. In the present fiscal
climate, the investment the rail network needs if services are to improve
will not be found in the public sector. Capital needed to upgrade track,
modernise rolling stock and build new lines will come from the private
sector or not at all.
Privatisation also offers the chance to bring in commercial management and
to open the railways to innovation. The productivity savings that commercial
management can find in nationalised industries have been demonstrated in
earlier privatisations.
In some cases, it may be management buyouts which win the franchises to run
rail services. Released from the shackles of a nationalised industry, the
existing managers will be free to manage and to compete with other forms of
transport. This is already evident on the line between London and Gatwick
airport, the first to experience competition. The three BR divisions
competing for passengers on this line have been spurred on to find new ways
of expanding their market share.
Exchequer subsidy
What makes rail different from previous privatisations is that it involves a
public service which is loss-making. Other nationalised industries may have
temporarily lurched in and out of the red. But most of the rail network will
require an exchequer subsidy well into the medium term. That is why BR could
not be sold off as a whole, with the sort of share sale that in previous
privatisations generated razzmatazz and some popular enthusiasm.
That is also why rail privatisation has had to be so fiendishly complex,
making it harder to sell to a sceptical public. The track infrastructure
will be separated from the running of trains. Rail freight will be sold off.
But BR's passenger services will be franchised out, with the contracts going
to the bidders requiring the lowest subsidies. In effect, the private sector
is being invited to manage passenger rail services on behalf of the public
sector.
If loss-making rail services can be contracted out to the private sector in
this way, the same approach could be extended to other public services.
Indeed, the management of 10 per cent of the UK's prisons is already being
put out to tender in a similar manner. Rather than being a privatisation too
far, the model adopted in rail privatisation could be the future that works
for unprofitable public services.
This is the first of two leaders on rail privatisation.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Still gently as he goes: The case for speedier reform in
Egypt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Hosni Mubarak, who assumed Egypt's presidency on the assassination of
Anwar Sadat in 1981, this week began a third presidential term which,
barring upsets, should last until 2000. This much was clear long before the
formality of last week's referendum, in which 95 per cent of Egyptians who
voted endorsed six more years of Mr Mubarak's rule.
Less clear is what Mr Mubarak will do with his six years. Before the vote he
stressed that, though he ran unchallenged, 'no one should think this vote
won't change things'. Yesterday saw the first signs of change, as Mr Atef
Sidki, Mr Mubarak's long-serving prime minister, finalised a shuffle of 16
of the cabinet's 34 portfolios.
The reshuffle was a long-awaited response to domestic pressure for new faces
in what was looking a tired government. But many old faces remain,
particularly in the powerful defence, interior and central economic posts.
'He's given the impression of change and dynamism,' was one diplomat's
response, 'but most of the old guard is still there.'
The pressure for change is also strong among Egypt's allies, as well as the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank - custodians of Egypt's economic
reforms.
The need for action on the economy is acute. A quarter of Egypt's 58m people
live on less than Dollars 35 a month, according to the World Bank,
unemployment is officially 20 per cent and unofficially twice that, and a
plodding, public sector-led economy cannot keep pace with population growing
at 2.3 per cent a year. Worse, a rising wave of Islamic extremism is feeding
on the discontent that has resulted: in the past 18 months there have been
bombings in Cairo, assassination attempts on ministers and clashes with
security forces that have left 200 people dead.
After 12 years at the helm, Mr Mubarak is no stranger to these problems. But
his instinct has been to address them cautiously, with the help of a close
coterie of trusted aides and ministers - almost all of whom survived the
reshuffle.
'Mr Mubarak's cautious style, which served him well in the 1980s, is still a
very cautious style and maybe not right for the '90s,' says Mr William
Quandt of the Brookings Institution, the Washington-based think-tank. 'There
are many who hold the perception that things are now changing too fast for
him.'
In numerous statements before and since the referendum, Mr Mubarak
emphasised more of the 'steady as she goes' policies which characterised his
first terms, during which he relaxed restrictions on opposition political
parties, began IMF and World Bank adjustment programmes and oversaw big
improvements in infrastructure. On Wednesday he told his ministers that
Egypt's priorities were economic reform, security, social justice,
unemployment, improving education, and tackling rising population and
cumbersome bureaucracy.
Nowhere, however, has Mr Mubarak suggested reforms to Egypt's political
system. Yesterday's cabinet reshuffle will do nothing to satisfy a
frustrated body of critics in Egypt who claim that systemic reform is
essential if the government is to counter the appeal of Islamic
fundamentalism. They argue that Egypt's political institutions are so
corrupt that the system can neither accommodate moderate Islamic opinion nor
offer modernising alternatives a popularly based platform.
In place of a vibrant democracy, say the critics, Mr Mubarak's tenure rests
on the backing of Egypt's influential military and on the powerful patronage
of the ruling National Democratic party. Referendum results showing 95 per
cent support for him partly strain credulity, but partly also highlight the
lack of democratic choice, they argue.
Critics like Mr Mohammed Sayed Ahmed, a leading commentator, as well as
opposition parties, recite a well-rehearsed wish list of reforms. Many say
the 21-year-old constitution should be rewritten. They say Mr Mubarak should
step down as president of the National Democratic party, because by holding
both party and national leadership he makes it impossible for other parties
to challenge the NDP effectively.
Critics also point out that Mr Mubarak has ruled Egypt under a state of
emergency since 1981, giving him virtually unchecked power. As a minimum,
they say, he should appoint a vice-president - a post unfilled since Mr
Mubarak himself held it under Sadat.
But by retaining Mr Sidki, not noted as a zealous reformer, and other close
aides, it seems Mr Mubarak's instincts are unaltered: that Islamic
fundamentalism must be crushed before any political changes are possible,
and that economic reform has to take priority. 'Mubarak does not want to
make a big jump in democracy without a parallel and equivalent progress in
economic development,' says Mr Mamdouh Beltagui, yesterday named tourism
minister.
Mr Mubarak campaigned hard on impressive progress made under the first
stages of the IMF and World Bank reforms - during 1990-92, inflation halved
to about 12 per cent, the budget deficit was slashed from more than 20 to
4.7 per cent of GDP, reserves rose to Dollars 17bn and the currency was
stable. The watchword for his third term, he suggested, would be more - but
steady - economic adjustment.
But even on economic policy, many wonder if his present government, in spite
of its new faces, has the ideological commitment or technical competence to
push through the next stage of structural reforms. Economists close to
Egypt's reforms say the country is merely at the threshold of the tough
structural changes that might enable the private sector to make
growth-producing inroads into the leaden, public sector-dominated economy.
'The government doesn't yet have even the minimum of technocracy in place
for these reforms,' says one. 'They are also about the most reluctant
reformers of the public sector you could conceive of.'
These economists hold out little hope that Egypt's economy will reach the
IMF target of GDP growth rates of 4 per cent or more over the next few years
without structural reforms which 'cut to the muscle'. An ambitious
privatisation programme, which the IMF considers the most important
indicator of the government's commitment to inspiring private sector-led
growth, is already suffering bureaucratic delay.
Even a half-baked stab at the next stage of economic reforms will incur
substantial social costs: higher unemployment in the short term. Without
attendant political and democratic reforms, opposition to these effects
could find vent through further Islamic extremism. The danger is that Mr
Mubarak's insistence on gradualism and stability will translate into
government inertia. But Egypt's problems are not standing still. 'The worst
thing that can happen to Egypt,' says Ms Judith Kipper, of the Brookings
Institution, 'is that nothing happens.'

FT  15 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Japan's trade access limitations
require unorthodox responses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr C FRED BERGSTEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In commenting on my article, 'Good and bad of managed trade' (August
18), Daniel Moylan asks (Letters, August 23) for criteria to judge whether
voluntary import expansions (VIEs) will increase economic wealth. There are
three such criteria: (1) demonstrable limitations on market access for
specific products; (2) where foreign goods or services are demonstrably
competitive; (3) where the preferable policy responses, eliminating a
visible barrier or applying anti-trust policy to collusive corporate
practices, are unavailable. In such cases, VIEs will increase competition
and reduce prices.
Mr Moylan fears that political clout rather than these objective criteria
will determine which sectors get VIEs. But political capture is much less
for VIEs than for the bad form of managed trade, voluntary export restraints
(VERs), because proper VIEs (as with semiconductors to Japan) set targets
for imports from all countries. Uncompetitive American exporters would thus
derive little benefit from a VIE negotiated for their products by the US
government.
This latter point exposes the errors in Professor Bhagwati's letter (August
24) on my article and in Miti official Risaburo Nezu's subsequent
contribution ('An ill-advised way to manage trade', September 1). Mr
Bhagwati claims that VIEs give 'your producers' a guaranteed market share
and promote cartels. But exporters in all countries must compete for the
newly available market. The framework agreement released by President
Clinton and former prime minister Miyazawa in Tokyo explicitly states that
'benefits under this framework will be on a most favoured nation basis',
refuting Mr Nezu's claims that the Clinton administration 'seems to be
pursuing' enhanced market access only for American firms.
Finally, Prof Bhagwati is flatly wrong in charging that my discovery of
Japanese import barriers is a recent phenomenon. In 'The United States-Japan
economic problem', published by the Institute for International Economics in
1985, William Cline and I derived estimates of the adverse impact of
Japanese barriers on American exports that are quite similar to those in my
new 'Reconcilable Differences? United States-Japan Economic Conflict'. Prof
Bhagwati also inferred incorrectly that I advocate VIEs for all 12 sectors
analysed in the new study; I plainly stated that NIEs are useful only for
intermediate industrial products and cannot be applied to consumer items,
and that they 'should be used sparingly and only with the utmost care'.
Japan's access limitations severely damaged the prospects for both trade
liberalisation and an effective General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
which Prof Bhagwati and Mr Nezu claim to support. It is that country's
pervasive pattern of exclusionary corporate practices, combined with opaque
governmental intervention, that requires resort to unorthodox policy
responses like VIEs.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Acceptable 'audit' of charities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr SIMON ZADEK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As a small charity, we do not feel 'under attack' by the new Home
Office report on the voluntary sector (Leader, October 13). Any contribution
to an evolving understanding of the role and effectiveness of the sector
should be welcomed, not least when this has engaged the time, energies and
insights of dozens of researchers and hundreds of voluntary organisations.
We would, however, caution against at least one aspect of the report. While
there should be no objection to the principle of performance assessment,
this process should directly voice the views of the intended beneficiaries.
The aptly named 'social audit' we recently piloted with the fair trading
company Traidcraft offers one way to do this (Accountancy column, August
26). The process engages key constituents who may have no formal, executive
authority, but on whose behalf actions are being taken (and money obtained).
They set the performance indicators by which the organisation's social or
ethical record is audited, with the results published alongside the annual
accounts.
This, and aspects of the Home Office report, both hopefully contribute to a
process which enables the voluntary sector to maintain the standards of
innovation, flexible organisation and accountability to which it aspires.

FT  15 OCT 93 / A peculiar British practice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When you run a brothel, it pays not to be too particular about your clients.
When you are in the business of making and selling armaments, or even
civilian equipment that can be used to manufacture weapons, you are obliged
to be choosy. Tiresome officials will insist on denying you access to
certain markets. Since you owe it to your shareholders to find ways of
completing sales where you can, you will lobby against these official
rulings. You may argue that if the government is concerned about employment
it should be flexible in applying whatever rules it has devised.
Before going any further, I must apologise for my opening analogy. It libels
an ancient service industry that does comparatively little harm. It does,
however, help to focus our attention on what is particularly important about
the inquiry being conducted by Lord Justice Scott into the sale of
defence-related equipment to Iraq. There are several troublesome questions
before his lordship. Each matters in its own way. We'll come to these in a
moment. But the most serious cause for concern is the continuing, if
declining, dependence of Britain's manufacturing industry on the trade in
armaments. This is the big one. Let us look at it first.
Just a few weeks ago Sir Alan Thomas, who is the head of exports at the
Ministry of Defence, boasted that in 1992 overseas orders were taken for
Pounds 5.2bn worth of British armaments. Sales this year were already above
that, he added. On checking yesterday it turns out that later information
from suppliers puts the 1992 figure at Pounds 6bn in 1992 money, and that
the current forecast for 1993 is Pounds 7bn-Pounds 7 1/2 bn.
Communications gear, computers and high-tech equipment feature strongly in
these orders. If the gadgets we were selling were, say, personal computers,
portable telephones, transistor radios and copying machines, all sold in
high street shops, we would not only be proud of that - we would be
Japanese. As matters stand, the defence department happily asserts that
Britain is now the second largest arms supplier. Its share of the world
market doubled, to 20 per cent, last year.
We are talking about missiles, armoured personnel carriers, trainer jets,
tanks, and loads and loads and loads of ammunition. I make no moral point.
That is either plain to you or it is not. Let the argument be about the
value of this trade to Britain's economy. It is certainly high at the
moment. The people in the arms business speak of 120,000 jobs directly
involved, or two or three times as many if component suppliers and others
are counted in. The total industry turnover may approach Pounds 15bn this
year, although to reach that figure you have to assume that orders taken in
1993 are the same thing as goods delivered.
That is a statistical quibble. The important question is whether the order
books can be kept full for many more years. Just look at that concocted
figure of Pounds 15bn for a few minutes and it begins to melt away. More
than half - Pounds 7.7bn - represents purchases by taxpayers of weapons for
British forces to stockpile and occasionally use. This is a two-way traffic
in cross-subsidisation. The exports help to keep the unit costs of the
domestic purchases low and vice versa. It is, however, a trade that is
doomed to decline. The squeeze on public spending will reduce defence
procurement, and thus the export subsidy, however cunningly defence
secretary Mr Malcolm Rifkind may phrase his protests.
Britain's armaments manufacturers employ a skilled workforce. Some of our
best engineers work in the well-known supplying companies. Too bad. This is
not, and should not be, a business of the future. The defence companies know
this. All, even British Aerospace, are diversifying into civilian work. The
arms trade may not be shrunk as rapidly as, say, coalmining but it is
nevertheless yesterday's game.
The Scott inquiry is about one aspect of how it has been played in the past.
It may shed light on how Whitehall plays all its games. When its report is
published we should be able to answer several specific questions with more
certainty than anyone can now. Did ministers and/or officials deliberately
seek to suppress information, knowing that to do so might lead to the
wrongful conviction of three executives of Matrix-Churchill on charges of
breaching export controls? Was there a failure to brief ministers? Mr
William Waldegrave, who in 1989 was the foreign office minister directly
concerned, told the inquiry this week that he was unaware of intelligence
reports showing that the machine tools in question were being used by the
Iraqis for military purposes. Was there a plot, or was Whitehall merely
incompetent?
These things matter. If ministers were willing to see individuals unjustly
jailed, they must go. If the spies' information is not being properly used,
the relevant civil servants must try harder. As to the third strand of the
case - the Waldegrave doctrine that where delicate matters of diplomacy are
concerned it is not always sensible to keep Parliament informed - the
outsiders' judgment may well be: 'Tell me another, Mr Minister for Open
Government.'
More to the point is the light that may be shed on the peculiarly English
nature of British administrative duplicity. Our masters are rarely corrupt
enough to lie and cheat outright, nor straightforward enough to be trusted
absolutely. The clever use of words, the economy with the truth, the
deployment of 'no reason to believe' and 'might have been at the time' and
'could be for quite innocent purposes', and the painstaking twisting of
definitions are well-known trademarks of perfidious Albion. The French do
the same thing in their own peculiar way, but not, it appears, as
effectively in terms of arms orders landed as the British.
The most charitable explanation of the case before Lord Justice Scott may be
that this player or that had the best interests of Britain's defence
workforce, or its future civilian trade in a peaceful Middle East, in mind.
The defence industry, and its lobbyists, will have played their part. We may
read of a series of well-meant mistakes, for which no one in particular is
to blame. That is the way of bland British inquiries. Yet this time may be
different. It is just possible that one or more of the relevant protagonists
will be seen to have been caught with his trousers down.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: No alternative to real policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STEPHEN THOMSEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Cassell's article on Britain's success in attracting inward
investment ('A challenge to pole position', October 13) promotes the idea
that attracting inward investment should be an end in itself.
As a recent Chatham House study demonstrated, Britain's success in
attracting investment extends well beyond the obvious examples of American
and Japanese companies, and this attraction shows little sign of waning.
Such investment is generally beneficial and should be welcomed, but it is
not a panacea. Forty-one foreign companies among the top 100 British
exporters have done little to eliminate trade deficits or to alleviate
unemployment.
The British government should concentrate on macroeconomic and commercial
policies instead of using inward investment as a surrogate for industrial
policy.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Guide to empire-building aspirations
of accountants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From G M SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I share the reluctant admiration expressed by Mr George Lapsley
(Letters, October 8) at the empire building inherent in the draft guidance
produced by the working party of the Institute of Chartered Accountants on
the audit of internal controls. But he is mistaken in suggesting that it has
not also thought of extending the suggested audit to other fields such as
marketing, quality, value for money and product development.
These (and other) fields are specifically considered in the 67 pages of the
draft and its 6 appendices (incidentally the original Cadbury code of best
practice is a modest two pages). For example, Chapter 2 refers to
'commitment to quality and competence', which is said to be useful in
preventing or limiting fraud, and 'commitment to truth and fair dealing',
which is said to be a guide to how employees will react to pressures.
These audit processes are said to be desirable for all business activities,
no matter what the size.
The working party is curiously silent on auditing the prompt payment of
bills or assessing the auditors on a value for money basis.
By coincidence, Christopher Lorenz on the same day ('The best way to rear
corporate babies') comments on the proven need in the development of new
business ventures by large corporations for them to be 'sheltered from
normal planning and control systems; otherwise they will be strangled'.
Perhaps that exclusion explains the vigorous growth of local business on the
Pacific rim, where the UK chartered accountant is rarely seen.
But let's not confuse matters by imagining that strangulation is bad for
business. It does, of course, enable the chartered accountant to fulfil
another fee-earning role - that of corporate undertaker.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Basics for industrial strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID A TURNBULL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In their report, ('Minister agrees to study CBI demands on policy',
October 13) Roland Rudd and Tim Burt referred to Tim Sainsbury, the industry
minister, saying he might consider issuing a white paper setting out the
government's industrial objectives. As nobody in industry knows where the
government is going, the sooner he gets on with it the better.
The report also referred to Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the
Confederation of British Industry, asking the government for a co-ordinated
coherent policy for manufacturing and industry. May I suggest that Mr Davies
reads the earlier published national strategy document of the UK Industrial
Group, titled 'Manufacture or Die'.
In this, the UK Industrial Group clearly sets out the fundamental economic
requirement of Pounds 40bn of extra industrial output to resolve the
problem. It would be more productive for the CBI to use its cosy
relationship with the government to address that issue, rather than simply
ask for more of what the government is already giving.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Arts: Absurdism and the reverse / Review of Ionesco and
Bulgakov
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How ironic: in the main auditorium of the Lyric Theatre Hammersmith you can
currently see an absurdist romp by Ionesco being performed in Romanian,
while in the studio theatre one floor beneath you can see performances in
English of a serious drama by Bulgakov. One is deliberately ludicrous, a
comedy shaped by the sense that ordinary life itself is wildly, inanely,
incoherent. The other has its absurdities - its opening scene features an
peasant who turns out to be an archbishop, and a woman in labour who turns
out to be a general - but is a near-tragedy about people escaping from a
country racked by civil war yet making coherence from life.
Though Ionesco wrote his plays in French, he was born in Romania and spent
much of his early life there. He began his form of theatre in France after
the Second World War and the division of Europe. ('Cut off from his
religious, metaphysical and transcendental roots, man is lost;' he wrote,
'all his actions become senseless, absurd, useless.') His work connects to,
and helped to define, the sense of the absurd that runs so deep in modern
French culture; but, as this staging of The Bald Prima Donna suggests, his
absurdism may also have been profoundly Romanian. In the post-Ceausescu
nation his plays are apparently now making great effect; this production has
elicited standing ovations there.
The Bald Prima Donna is like a Feydeau farce without a rationale. Mr and Mrs
Smith receive Mr and Mrs Martin; a maid assists; but a fireman calls; and .
. . The rest is mayhem. For the Hungarian Theatre of Cluj, Gabor Tompa bumps
up the craziness of everything by having the characters behave like
clockwork dolls. The set encourages us to believe we are watching life
within a doll's house, and the room is a white box set with bright neon
lighting. For those of us whose Romanian has grown rusty, there are
surtitles; but these are poorly projected (and timed), and the bright
onstage lights makes them hard to read.
Some in the audience kept up a constant supply of titters. My problem,
however, is one that will be shared by many Britons. Shaped by a culture
unlike Ionesco's or Ceausescu's, I cannot enjoy a sense of the absurd that
underlies everything. Tompa's staging ends with a coup whereby the cast
mime, at breakneck speed, the whole play backwards, from end to beginning,
at top speed. Bravura stuff. But so what? My only serious interest in the
whole affair is as a cultural observer - in trying to piece together the
ghastly mechanical but pointless sense of existence that must make Romanians
enjoy this so heartily.
Bulgakov's Flight (1926-8) also expresses a world that has been torn in two
 -but how profound his Russian view of history, and life. The action begins
in the Crimea in 1920, where the White Russian army is taking its last stand
and where refugees find themselves as much abused as they had been
elsewhere. Later, we see these Russian exiles stranded in Constantinople and
Paris. The first half shows us civil war, and the tragic sense of history
that we know in Shakespeare, Pushkin, Tolstoy and Pasternak. The second half
is like Ninotchka in reverse; it shows us Russians bewildered by Western
corruption, hopeless, and gradually deciding to go home to rediscover
themselves.
Flight has not been seen here for 21 years, years in which Bulgakov's work
in fiction and drama has become better known to us. This Contemporary Stage
Company production is directed by David Graham-Young, whose recent staging
of Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita earnt acclaim. Some minor roles are
weakly acted, and Wolfe Morris's account of the White Commander-in-Chief is
a terrible display of old ham. But the four central parts are played with
integrity: particularly Peter Tate in the most remarkable, and most tragic,
role of General Khludov, a man tortured by physical and moral exhaustion,
duty, and, above all, conscience.
I cannot recommend everything about this production of Flight - for too much
of the evening a certain English mildness inhibits Bulgakov's vision of
history - but it is a play that should be seen. Whereas, to my mind at
least, The Master and Margarita is an exceptional novel that never fully
translated to the stage, Flight belongs naturally in the theatre; I am
amazed we have not seen it more often. It is one of the most stirring, and
most multi-faceted, visions of how a country, and individual people, were
torn in two. Whereas The Bald Prima Donna reduces humanity to a pointless
joke, Flight makes the human condition poignant, complex, rich.
The Bald Prima Donna is at the Lyric, Hammersmith, this week, and then tours
to Derry, Glasgow, Leeds and Oxford during October and November. Flight
continues at the Lyric Studio until November 6

FT  15 OCT 93 / Arts: Beside the seaside - William Packer visits exhibitions
in Cornwall and Norfolk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The opening of an important, custom-built, publicly-funded gallery is always
to be remarked, and all the more so the further it is from London; we are
all regionalists and devolutionaries now. The Tate's offspring, tucked into
the site of the old gasometer above Porthmeor Beach at the back of the town,
opened its doors to the public in mid-summer, to general applause which,
even now, has hardly died down. The 100,000th visitor came through the door
the week before last, half a year ahead of expectation and but half a day
after the Patrons of New Art and a clutch of Friends of the Academy. The
place was packed.
Not that it is hard to pack, being no more than a circuit of three or four
smallish exhibition rooms with a larger and more open sculpture gallery at a
lower level. For the time being it remains its own attraction, an intricate
and ingenious response by the architects, Eldred Evans and David Shalev, to
the exigencies of a steep and awkward site. The exterior, with its curves
and balconies and flattened top, is discreetly modern, hinting at the long
tradition of seaside architecture. Inside, the sense of place is constantly
reinforced by the spectactular view, high over the beach and out to sea,
that is caught at every turn, as inescapable as the scream of the gulls and
the crash of the surf.
But it has to be by the work on the walls and the programmes and policies of
display that the enterprise is to be justified. The first rehang, barely
three months on, suggests that the finer tuning is already under way. And
the Tate at St Ives has its built-in limitations, as it would appear to be
dedicated to St Ives in its particular role and period, roughly from the
mid-1920s to around 1960, as a crucible of British modernism.
The point is that were this to be inflexibly so, it would unduly limit St
Ives itself, to say nothing of Cornwall. It is still too early to enter even
a mild reservation with any fairness and besides, as it is, there is so much
to admire and enjoy. The current offerings include an impressive study
display of work by Terry Frost from the early 1950s, when his observation of
boats rocking in the harbour, and the shifting, repetitive patterns of the
tides, commited him finally to abstraction. In the general hang it is good
to see John Wells given a proper prominence, an artist for too long
grievously under-recognised, and Bryan Wynter too, a similar case.
But it is not unreasonable to point an opportunity that is waiting to be
taken. St Ives has had its moments, even of international importance, but it
has never been the only significant local centre within our wider national
school; and the art-historical significance of west Cornwall extends rather
further back than the moment when Christopher Wood and Ben Nicholson came
puffing round the corner on the branch-line from Hayle. Many good artists
have gone on working in or near St Ives ever since.
It would be a mistake for the Tate at St Ives merely to be a
Wood-Nicholson-Hepworth benefit for the early years, or, for the matter of
that, a Heron-Lanyon-Frost-Hilton benefit later on, rich though their
creative legacies are. Their work needs to be viewed in a wider context to
explain the enduring attraction and importance of the far west of Cornwall
to successive generations of British artists. That is the true opportunity.
Given his long friendship with Barbara Hepworth and Ben Nicholson, it is
perhaps surprising that Henry Moore, too, did not fetch up at St Ives. But
he never did: indeed at times he could hardly have been further away. In
1922, his elder sister Mary took up the post of schoolmistress at the
village of Wighton, set back a mile or two from the north Norfolk coast. She
persuaded their parents to move with her, though their father died almost
immediately, which effectively removed the family home from its native
Castleford.
Henry, a student at the Royal College in London, spent his holidays at
Wighton and it was there, in the garden behind the school-house, that he
first began what was to be his life-long practice of carving in the open
air. His broken chisels, stuck in the wall to hold up the roses, and some
half-worked blocks of stone, were found by the present owners, an American
artist, Alfred Cohen and his wife Diana, who were unaware of the Moore
connection when they bought the by-now disused school as house and studio
some 15 years ago.
In 1983 they opened the School House as an occasional gallery, which
anniversary is now marked by Henry Moore and the Sea. Already shown at
Portland and Chichester, with further venues in prospect, its stay at
Wighton must surely be special. It is the smallest travelling exhibition
that the Henry Moore Foundation has ever put on, consisting of a baker's
dozen of maquettes and small sculptures and a number of etchings and
lithographs. All but one sculpture, a tiny mother-and-child arch of 1959,
date from the 1970s and 1980s in the artist's old age
The connection with the sea is thus not direct, but rather a remembered
experience, drawing upon the found objects, the pebbles, shells and dried
bones that Moore picked up on beaches all his life. It is as though, looking
at this small collection in this most charming of galleries, we pick up the
shell and put it to our ear.
The Tate Gallery, St Ives: sponsored by First Class Pullman, Intercity.
Henry Moore and the Sea: The School House Gallery, Wighton,
Wells-next-the-Sea, Norfolk, until November 15.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Arts: From Mike Leigh, 'It's a Great Big Shame'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sad news from the normally joyous Theatre Royal, Stratford East. Mike
Leigh's It's a Great Big Shame is about as dismal a three hour show as you
can expect to see. It is also incoherent.
The basic idea is a good one. Here are two plays presented as one. The
first, and much the longer, is set in east London, 1893. The second is in
the same place a century later. We are invited, I suppose, to contrast and
compare and to conclude that it is still a great big shame.
The title comes from a song by London music hall artist Gus Elen
(1862-1940). It is a wistful, melancholy ballad in a style not far away from
Kipling: sentimentality mixed with a lurking brutality.
At the start of the play the song is performed by Nellie Buckett, described
as a waif. Nellie looks and dresses so like a man that for a while I assumed
there was some sexual nuance. But the programme states that she is a woman
played by Kathy Burke. It is the degradation of poverty that is responsible
for her appearance, though she is not exactly down and out.
Nellie falls for the best and most interesting character in the play. He is
about seven feet tall and called Jim Short, the choice of name being almost
the only joke in the piece. Short is a fourth-class drayman, delivering beer
to pubs. Played by Paul Trussell, he is an utterly amiable figure with an IQ
well below average. He won't touch Nellie the waif, but accepts with
docility a proposal of marriage from the shop assistant Ada (Wendy
Nottingham).
For about six weeks Ada serves him tea, gives him supper and generally waits
on him. Then she turns militant, makes him scrub the floor and wash the
windows. When Jim's temper snaps, it is possible that he does not mean to
strangle her and is simply unaware of his own strength. It is more of a
surprise when he starts to eat her.
There have been some odd scenes before this outbreak of cannibalism. Ruth
Sheen as Fanny Clack, the landlady of the Cock and Bull, presides over some
very pleasant music hall songs in her pub. A drunken West Indian enters and
is ultimately thrown out. A brief scene shows that the brewers can quarrel
with their fiancees quite as brutally as the lower orders. There is an
impressive entry of two huge wooden horses pulling the draymen's cart.
The second act, in 1993, is all black. This time the woman has at least
twice the physical bulk of her husband. She strangles him, though again
whether by accident or design is not clear. Possibly it is a sign of
advancing civilisation that she does not eat him: there had been earlier
hints of what might be done with the microwave.
The final scene is played in near-darkness, so is obscure in every sense.
The person on the floor may be the dead husband toying with his own
entrails, or Ada returned as a sign of what comes of excessive violence.
Sole pleasures are the singing of the ballads around the bar and the early
character of Jim Short in the first act. The rest is dreadful. Mike Leigh
directs his own work.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Arts: Tristan on speed - Music in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Under their conductor Franz Welser-Most, the London Philharmonic played
Wagner on Wednesday. The result was a draw that flattered nobody. Not
uninteresting, not dull or heedless; just not good enough for Tristan und
Isolde - especially for Wagnerite Londoners hoping that this Festival Hall
performance would be some consolation for the opera's long absence from
Covent Garden and St Martin's Lane. What might count as memorable about
Welser-Most's account, some good singing aside, is that it may have been the
quickest Tristan ever.
The first act was delivered smoothly and very briskly. Not a bad idea, one
thought, for a concert performance which excluded interpersonal drama though
the urgent thrills of the last, fast duet would have counted for more if the
wary confrontation of the lovers had built up anything like the right head
of steam first.
Act 2 was speedy beyond reason. There was no fraught, tingling atmosphere at
the start - and rather terrible things seemed to be happening among the
offstage 'hunting' horns (who therefore sounded more like the real thing
than what Wagner wrote). In the immense love duet, the conductor switched to
fast-forward so early that his principals soon sounded like excited puppies
in a Disney cartoon, yelping out their phrases without a hope of giving them
any erotic slant or expressive colour.
The Act 3 prelude was squeezed out very slowly, to little communicative
effect: one could not help thinking that Welser-Most is just too young to
try that on. But Tristan's great soliloquies were hustled along; the long,
heartbreaking swells on high violins were reduced to snappy interjections,
and the richest orchestral commentary emerged incoherently. Heinz Kruse's
Tristan began to tire (most Tristans get more than just 20-minute breaks
between acts). From the start his bright, somewhat impersonal elegance had
been a virtue; but now, despite an occasional gleam of passion, the
portrayal dwindled to blueprint-scale.
Kruse's diction was always a crisp pleasure, for he spent 20 years as a
character-tenor before expanding into Heldentenor roles. Yet Elizabeth
Connell's Isolde found subtler depths in her words; if she lacked the ideal
Isolde's warmth in the mezzo register, her terrific thrust higher up was
complemented by luminous character everywhere. (Her Liebestod was almost too
subtle; we need it, after all, to be a glorious catharsis.) As Kurwenal,
Tristan's staunch vassal, David Wilson-Johnson limned some unaccompanied
phrases poignantly, but otherwise faded into the orchestra. For this role,
his 'bass'-baritone has neither the substance nor the bottom.
Della Jones's Brangaene was an honourable non-starter: peppered with
character but shrewish at the top, alternating with crashes into raw
chest-voice. We got the real thing only from Curt Appelgren's King Mark  -
grandly gentle and broad, quivering with personal hurt; and young Ian
Bostridge as the Young Sailor and Shepherd deployed his fresh, non-reedy
timbre (and excellent German) to beautiful and sharply immediate effect. And
the LPO's lovely flutes distinguished themselves throughout.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Arts: Taut Strauss and Stravinsky
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The policy of having a single low price for any seat has certainly lowered
the average age at the BBC Symphony Orchestra's concerts. The Strauss and
Stravinsky series was not planned with any specific educational aim in mind,
but it can hardly have failed to heighten appreciation of 20th-century
musical history.
The opportunity to contrast two such diverse personalities was nowhere
presented in a didactic way. The audiences were left to come to their own
conclusions - nudged just a little at Tuesday's concert, the last in the
series. How else could one come up with the combination of Stravinsky at his
most impersonal in Oedipus Rex and the egocentric Strauss of Ein
Heldenleben, proclaiming his loves, his battles, his achievements to be the
centre of the musical universe?
The Stravinsky opera-oratorio was the largest of the composer's works in the
series. It will have left a picture of him at his least endearing. In his
treatment of the Oedipus myth Stravinsky's determination to keep personal
reaction to a minimum resulted in music that is not just objective but
unmemorable.
The score calls for cool-headed control, which Andrew Davis exerts
impressively over the BBC Symphony Orchestra. Ideally one imagines voices
monumental in their own right, which only Felicity Palmer's fearsomely
stringent Jocasta could be described as offering. Anthony Rolfe Johnson was
the sensitive Oedipus, genuinely moving at the end. Anthony Michaels-Moore
did good service as Creon and the Messenger; the BBC Symphony Chorus had
been well drilled.
The firm grip on the conductor's baton that kept the Stravinsky taut was
also brought to bear upon the Strauss. The BBCSO may not have the silken
strings, the magniloquent brass, the overall tonal allure of the great
Straussian orchestras, but it is heartening to hear its members play as
though everybody knows what they are playing and why. Each episode was full
of character, except perhaps the one where Strauss mocks his critics, who
sounded far too nice a bunch.
Davis makes a superb commander-in-chief and delivered one of the best
battles I have heard. The love scene was carefully shaped, but not heady,
certainly not indulgent. The warm glow, that sense of sinking into one's
memories that comes over the final pages, as yet eludes the conductor or the
orchestra, possibly both. Not a complete Ein Heldenleben, but an effective
one.

Two of the very best English gardens, romantic Kiftsgate Court in
Gloucestershire and Esther Merton's rectory in Berkshire, bring to a close
An English Woman's Garden (BBC 2, 8.30). Mrs Merton's garden is full of
marvellous plants and is not widely known, so tonight's programme should not
be missed.
A new comedy series, Demob (ITV, 9.00) brings Griff Rhys Jones and Martin
Clunes together as soldiers newly back in Civvy Street. They team up and
start at the bottom of the ladder as comedians in Liverpool.
Odd one out of the week is The Living Soap (BBC 2, 7.15), the
fly-on-the-wall documentary about the lives of six very assorted students
studying at Manchester University. They share a house procured for them by
the BBC - hundreds of students applied for the job. The six are, quite
rightly, paid for appearing in the series, which will help their measly
grants stretch a little further.
Clive Anderson Talks Back (C4, 10.30), is the first of another series of the
long-running chat show - guests are David Frost and Gore Vidal.

FT  15 OCT 93 / People: Benson opts to help fund the opt-outs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Christopher Benson is moving from his job distributing government grants
to housing associations as chairman of the Housing Corporation to the
potentially hotter seat of distributing grants to grant-maintained or
'opted-out' schools.
He takes up his post formally next April, when the Funding Agency for
Schools, created by this year's Education Act, starts its work. His first
task is to work with John Patten, the education secretary, in appointing a
chief executive for the fledgling organisation which, like the recently
deceased National Curriculum Council, will be based in York.
The job is likely to be tough, as the government is strongly committed to
promoting grant-maintained schools as part of its campaign to weaken the
hold of local education authorities, some of which, according to Patten, are
led by 'nutters'.
Sir Christopher, whose former experience in the education sector came as a
governor of Marlborough College, is taking his new brief diplomatically:
'I'm coming to a new job with an open mind. I'm going to do my best to
implement government policy, and to smooth transitions. That will require a
close liaison with local education authorities.'
A surveyor by training, Sir Christopher also holds the chairmanships of
Boots, Sun Alliance and Costain.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Management: Avoiding the IBM trap - Christopher Lorenz
continues a series on corporate creativity by looking at EDS's tough
self-analysis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE face of it, you might not expect Les Alberthal to be a worried man.
EDS, the company which he heads, has an enviable reputation in the
fast-growing global market for information technology services and an
impeccable financial record - including a 16 per cent increase in sales and
net income last year. But that very success is the problem. Alberthal's fear
is that if it is not careful EDS could become as proud, inward-looking and
unresponsive to change as General Motors, IBM and countless other successful
large companies. 'We don't want to make the same type of mistake that they
have,' he says.
To pre-empt that risk well ahead of time, he has just led the Dollars 8bn
(Pounds 5.2bn) Dallas-based company, founded 31 years ago by Ross Perot and
now owned by GM, through the toughest self-analysis it has undertaken since
it first broke into systems integration, network management and other areas
of IT services. By EDS's traditionally authoritarian standards, the exercise
has been remarkably participative.
The resulting revitalisation process is still under way - if revitalisation
is the right term for such a successful company.
For competitive reasons, many of the review's consequences are still secret.
But it has already loosened EDS's thinking, catapulting it into several
strategic steps over the past few months which it would not have taken two
years ago, before the review began.
They include a direct move into management consulting, and an alliance in
digital video-on-demand with Spectradyne, a leading US and international
provider of pay-TV and other information systems for hotels.
Alberthal denies vehemently that any of this is old-style diversification.
Instead he calls it a very focused 'leveraging' of its core competences -
both its technology and its people's entrepreneurialism.
The EDS chairman and chief executive is in no doubt about why almost all
successful large companies lose their edge, and many eventually come a
cropper. 'When you're extraordinarily successful, when you can do no wrong,
when you are dominating a marketplace and you've built something that's
really fantastic and the world says 'isn't this wonderful', the natural
human tendency is to start institutionalising it,' he says.
'Everything becomes inwardly-focused: the process of research, development
and designing, your process of thinking about the market, your education
process. You say this is 'the GM way' or 'the EDS way'. While some of that
speaks to your core competencies, once you become totally preoccupied with
it you ignore the marketplace. You wind up with a Cadillac, an Oldsmobile or
a Buick all looking exactly the same because the engineers have said this is
the way to do it. But the marketplace says 'we don't want that'.
'Or you do what IBM did - it ignored the personal computer and the demand of
the marketplace for personalised technology and got a few years behind the
curve. Once you do that, it becomes very difficult in a high-paced R&amp;D
environment to catch up.' This is true however talented your people are,
Alberthal emphasises - and he stresses tactfully that EDS-owner GM and IBM
'are top-quality organisations'.
The way Alberthal tells it, he and EDS's other top managers had become aware
by 1991 that the company was facing various risks of this kind. They were
starting to wrestle with them, but could not quite grasp the exact nature of
the dangers, nor what remedial action was needed. He likens this process to
experiencing pain, but not being quite sure of its cause. They also did not
know how to convey their sense of unease down the company, in the face of
its glowing sales and profits performance.
A more striking perspective is given by Greig Trosper, EDS director of
strategic planning. As he describes it, the trigger for change was a course
at the London Business School which suddenly opened the eyes of half a dozen
EDS executives, and resulted in the course leader, Gary Hamel, being called
in as a consultant.
'His question of whether we, as an industry leader, were different from GM
in 1965, Caterpillar in 1975, or IBM in 1975, started us thinking', Trosper
told last month's annual meeting of the international Strategic Management
Society. So did the academic's analysis of why great companies surrender
leadership. 'Our leadership saw itself reflected in it', said Trosper.
This analysis suggests that large companies tend to lose their way as their
industries start to change. They mistakenly think their greater scale and
resources will enable them to continue winning in the marketplace. That
reduces any sense of urgency on their part. At the same time their deep-down
assumptions and lack of vision (Alberthal's 'inward focus') make them
prisoners of their past. They define their problems as marginal, not
central, and fail to apply adequate intellectual effort to them.
As a result such companies tend to change more slowly than their industries,
and fail either to see the need for, or to build, what Hamel and Trosper
call 'a new economic engine'. This is in spite of the fact that such
constant re-treading is obviously vital, especially in industries whose
boundaries are changing constantly and in unpredictable directions.
Now that a small internal 'corporate change team' under Trosper has done
much of its work, Hamel's jibe about the dangers of scale-induced
over-confidence bites deep within EDS. The company recently lost a large
European order to a competitor - Ross Perot's new company - even though the
latter had no local resources.
But in 1991 too few people within EDS saw such problems looming. This was in
spite of the fact that it had, since 1985, been displaying one of the
classic early warning signs of future problems: a levelling-off of its rate
of productivity growth.
Trosper also says that 'almost no-one inside the company was giving any
thought to what the next a big step should be' in EDS's growth. Between 1960
and the late 1980s it experienced several quantum leaps, thanks to a
succession of sudden changes in the market.
Rather than trying to convey top-down messages of concern through a
reluctant organisation, the answer was to expose a much larger group of
managers to the same experience of painful self-discovery as the original
half-dozen. 'We decided to build a shared sense of urgency, and a common
view of what was necessary, and then get out of the way,' Trosper explains.
A group of 150 people were handpicked for what he and Alberthal call 'their
ability to think outside the box'. In a company not exactly noted for the
diversity of its leadership - most are Texans - great emphasis was placed on
picking people from all over the globe, of all ages, organisational levels
and lengths of service, and with different styles of thinking.
They were broken into five 'waves' of 30, focusing on different issues.
These included: a redefinition of EDS in terms of its 'core competencies',
which Trosper says has helped it escape 'the myopia of how we currently
serve the market'; an analysis of the potential forces that could be used to
create radical change in EDS's industries; a search for 'white space'
(uncontested new competitive areas); and planning for the changes in
behaviour and systems needed to enable EDS to transform itself effectively.
Given the competitive sensitivity of some of the results of this change
process, Alberthal and Trosper are loath to say much at this stage about its
internal effects, and the opportunities identified as a result. But Trosper
says one effect is that people have realised the growing need to achieve
much greater 'mass customisation' of many of EDS's services and products.
Another break with EDS's past is a recognition that, in order to occupy new
competitive 'space', the company does not always have to take giant steps
and put itself at risk - 'bet the farm', in EDS parlance. Instead, it can
move step by step, with relatively small investments.
Hamel recalls the eyes of one top EDS Texan, Barry Sullivan, lighting up as
this realisation struck him. He drawled: 'Ah] I see what this means - that
we only need bet the pig.'

FT  15 OCT 93 / Management: Business in the classroom - Employer-education
partnerships are increasing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Education-business partnerships, which employers use to improve employee
career development and boost their community links, appear to be gaining in
popularity.
They are also penetrating every corner of the UK, as the winners of this
year's Gardner Merchant awards for excellence in education-business
partnerships demonstrate. The overall winners - awarded this week - came
from Skye and from Northampton, while the winner in a third category came
from the Handsworth district of Birmingham.
Industry's understanding of involvement with education is also progressing.
First seen as an aid to public relations, with a possible boost to long-term
recruitment, it now forms a positive part of employee-development
programmes.
Rather than helping local schools via a cheque from the budget for
charitable donations, personnel departments now see the benefits of sending
employees on secondments to schools.
Gardner Merchant's judging policy reflects this. Garry Hawkes, chief
executive, said: 'What we were looking for was mutuality, so that both sides
benefited, and for something that was meaningful for both the companies and
the children, not just an exercise in self-gratification.'
Long-term benefits in terms of improving the skills base of UK industry
could be immense.
At the Hopping Hill primary school and Express Lift Company partnership in
Northampton, winner in the category for individual schools and businesses,
an informal link developed into a systematised personnel policy.
It started in 1988 after a girl told the headteacher, Val Newton, 'girls
can't be engineers'. Newton asked Express Lifts, a local engineering
employer, to prove otherwise, and a female technical apprentice was
despatched to the school to talk about her job.
The scheme has since developed into an annual 'project', involving boys and
girls. This year, eight teams of eight-year-olds were charged with building
a wind-powered vehicle, each supervised by an apprentice. To succeed in the
project, each entry was judged against standards of design, quality and
cost-effectiveness.
Janet Stephenson, a director of Express Lifts, admits: 'At first we thought
it was just a PR exercise, but we began to see the benefits for our
apprentices of going into the school and working as project managers.'
Most of the employees seconded are non-graduates, in the second-year of a
technical apprenticeship.
According to Stephenson: 'Working at the school is built into their
management training, because they gain managerial skills from working with
the children in a non-threatening environment which they would not be able
to gain elsewhere.'
Apprentices improve their communication skills, while the project also
addresses the engineering industry's 'image problem'.
Partnerships can also aim at improving employment opportunities. The Skye
and Lochalsh Partnership, for example, won the award for links involving
several businesses and schools. Launched in 1992, it now involves 173
employers and a number of primary and high schools.
Projects to date include teacher placements at Talisker Distillery and a
fund management company. Businesses have arranged problem-solving challenges
for school children, and mock interviews.
The high entry figure of 150 for Gardner Merchant's awards - double last
year's total - shows that education-business partnerships are growing more
popular, as companies appreciate the full potential benefits.
Altruism and broader political objectives are not wholly lacking. Stephenson
says: 'It's one way of industry having some input into what's going on in
schools. We moan about education so we should do something to improve it.'

FT  15 OCT 93 / People: Eric Anstee puts his energies into Eastern
Electricity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Eastern Electricity has tempted Eric Anstee away from his senior partnership
at Ernst &amp; Young management consultants; he is joining the privatised
utility as its group finance director.
Anstee, 42, is no stranger to the energy sector. His experience includes a
stint at the Treasury, between 1983-86; he was seconded there as a
commercial accounting adviser, in particular working on the privatisation of
British Gas.
In 1990 he was an adviser to two of the 12 regional electricity companies -
not Eastern Electricity, however - in the run-up to their privatisations.
But Anstee does have previous connections with Eastern, having led a team of
Ernst &amp; Young people providing statistical support to the company some 18
months ago, in the middle of a government regulatory review of the
industry's supply and price mechanism. His other posts with Ernst &amp; Young
included three years in Singapore as a senior manager where he was involved
with commodity trading.
Anstee has been with Ernst &amp; Young for 19 years and a partner since 1984. He
takes over at Eastern from Richard Leveritt, who is retiring after 23 years
with the company. Leveritt will stay on the board until December 31; Anstee
is working for Eastern on a part-time basis until he takes over full-time on
January 1.
Meanwhile, at Ernst &amp; Young, Keith Stein, 47, is stepping into Anstee's
shoes as the partner in charge of the privatisation, energy and utilities
group within its management consultancy practice.
Stein (far right) has been with the firm since 1977, when he joined its
financial management wing. More recently, he has led several of the firm's
international privatisation projects in eastern Europe, including the
voucher privatisation schemes in the Czech and Slovak republics, Hungary and
Romania.
One of the newest privatisation projects Stein will now be overseeing is an
agreement signed between Ernst &amp; Young and the Egyptian government just two
weeks ago.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Property: New clothes for a ragged sector - Italy's market
is being radically refashioned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SANDRA JONES and ALLESSANDRO SANZONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For decades the Italian property market, like the wider economy, has been
heavily influenced by partitocrazia (party allegiance and corruption).
Unauthorised constructions have been common; developments have been
undertaken without any provision for appropriate infrastructure; and little
regard has been paid to satisfying the real demands of potential buyers.
But things are now changing. In the clamour for change unleashed by the
widespread exposure of bribery in government and business, the property
sector is poised for an overhaul. According to Nomisma, a research group
based in Bologna, the market will undergo fundamental changes over the next
few years. These include:
improvements in valuation methods, record-keeping and accountability;
and the development of more sophisticated vehicles through which property
can be acquired and held.
Already this year, Italy has adopted the second EC directive on the
'co-ordination of banks' which will end the division between ordinary banks
and special credit institutes. Until now the former have been restricted to
short- or medium-term lending while the latter have been confined to making
long-term loans.
The blurring of the distinction between ordinary banks and special credit
institutes is expected to encourage the development of new financial
products, making property investment easier. New legislation expected to be
enacted in 1993-94 will also allow the creation of property funds and new
pension funds.
In addition, the government has proposed a spending programme of L10,000bn
between 1993-95 on infrastructure improvements designed to create jobs.
Also, Italy's leading railway company, recently privatised, is funding the
regeneration of old railway land in cities such as Rome and Milan.
Combined, these measures are likely to boost private-sector property
investment and provide an impetus for upgrading - and enforcing -
professional standards, particularly in methods of conducting and recording
property valuations.
Unlike the markets of its European neighbours, bank lending to property in
Italy is relatively low, a critical factor, say observers, in the Italian
sector's relative resilience in recent months. In Britain, by contrast,
banks have been badly exposed by their lending to property, which reached
unprecedented levels in the late 1980s.
According to Nomisma, the Italian sector - unlike other European markets -
has emerged relatively unscathed from the worldwide recession. In the past
six months the value of office property in Italy has declined by slightly
less than half a percentage point, while the value of the retail sector has
fallen by 2.2 per cent. Rents for offices have fallen by 6.2 per cent and by
7 per cent for retail properties over the same period; the value of
residential property increased by 1.2 per cent and residential rents by 5.5
per cent.
The property market attracted some L152,000bn last year, of which half was
invested in the residential sector. A further 20 per cent of the total went
into infrastructure improvements and the balance was split between retail,
office and industrial property. This is in contrast to the British market,
where commercial property is the main recipient of investment.
At present most commercial office stock is owner-occupied; even small
professional partnerships tend to own premises in town centres. The
attractions of commercial property as an active investment medium are still
unexploited, so this sector holds out many opportunities.
Insurance companies and banks are also leading investors, but again much of
their stock is retained for operational purposes; even banks' residential
premises are set aside for employees. Pension funds are also significant
property investors but no data on volume is available.
The latest figures from Italy's central bank suggest that insurance
companies' property holdings total L20,000bn, of which commercial property
(mainly offices) accounts for about 40 per cent and residential 50 per cent.
Banks' property holdings total L18,400bn, with offices accounting for 80 per
cent of the total, most of which are owner-occupied and situated in historic
town centres. Many of these town centres have become saturated, though this
has yet to encourage significant out-of-town developments.
The bias towards residential property in investment activity is largely due
to two factors. First, insurance companies have been obliged by law to
invest 4 per cent of their reserves in residential property with protected
rents; second, banks have tended to acquire accommodation to house their
staff enabling them to relocate on demand. Rent control legislation was
lifted last year and while the effects will take some time to feed through
into the market, Nomisma expects this measure to cause substantial rental
growth in the medium term. New legislation has also restricted security of
tenure, giving many landlords an automatic right to break a lease after
eight years.
Besides the effects of partitocrazia, the main impediment to a smooth
working of the market has been bureaucracy. One big problem for property
companies has been to determine who in government makes decisions and on
what basis.
Property companies have particularly been subject to the unofficial
practices that mushroomed with the growth of partitocrazia. Today it is
still difficult to collect information on property ownership. There is
little reliable data; what data does exist has not been made publicly
available by government, local authorities or companies. Under Italian
accounting practices, companies are not required to record current property
values in balance sheets; valuations which are quoted in balance sheets are
not carried out according to any recognised national standard or on a
regular basis and therefore provide little indication of real current market
values.
The legacy of partitocrazia has been a weak economy, with a public debt
representing 106 per cent of gross domestic product in 1992. Unemployment is
10.5 per cent and rising. Privatisation is high on the government's agenda,
though it has been hit by internal bickering over the best methods of
divestiture.
The crackdown on partitocrazia - evidenced by the spate of bribery charges
against politicians and businessmen - allied with a tougher regulatory
structure - is likely to lead to a more transparent business environment;
this will be reflected in changes in the property market.
For potential investors, an improving economy, with increased government
spending on infrastructure, a market with inherent supply constraints (such
as historic town centres where expansion is physically not possible) and
financial innovation add up to the right combination of ingredients to
refashion Italy's property industry.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Technology: Up again from a knockout / A look at recent
innovations in anaesthetics, in a series on drug discoveries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new generation of anaesthetics is helping to create a revolution in
operating theatres. Micro-surgery, together with innovative anaesthetics
that allow for rapid post-operative recovery, have led to a surge in the
number of patients able to return home on the same day as their operation.
Minimally-invasive surgery, using lasers and fibre optics through small
keyhole incisions, means patients no longer have such serious wounds to
heal. The rapid-recovery anaesthetics mean they are awake more quickly and
feel better when they regain consciousness.
Only 10 years ago, very little surgery was conducted on a same-day basis.
Now, 58 per cent of general anaesthetics administered in the US are on an
out-patient basis, according to BOC, the British group which is one of the
leaders in this field.
Among European countries, Ireland and the UK make the greatest use of
day-care surgery, although its practice is a long way behind the US. Recent
reforms in Germany which mean hospitals are paid by the number of patients
operated on, rather than the length of stay in hospital should encourage the
use of new anaesthetics, according to Zeneca, the recently floated
bioscience operation of Imperial Chemical Industries.
Routine surgery conducted this way includes operations to remove the
gall-bladder, non-cardiac vascular surgery, gynaecological procedures,
hernia repairs and operations on knees and ankles.
This type of production-line surgery is fast and highly cost-effective.
Roger Stoll, chief executive of BOC Health Care, explains: 'Cost containment
in healthcare is taking place everywhere - the US, Japan, Europe. The
cost-effectiveness of products is becoming as important as their efficacy
and safety. That is having an impact in all therapeutic areas, and
particularly in the operating theatre.'
Andrew Bilsky, product information manager at Zeneca, adds: 'Rapid recovery
from anaesthesia means fewer nurses are required for post-operative care,
more operations can be conducted and patients return home more quickly. They
also get back to work and are economically productive that much more
quickly.'
The market for anaesthetics is in transition, partly because of the
change-over from the older products that caused considerable nausea and
vomiting to newer ones, such as BOC's inhaled anaesthetic Suprane and
Zeneca's intravenous product Diprivan.
It is also being affected by the expiry of US patents for BOC's Forane, one
the most widely-used gases among the older anaesthetics. Forane had a market
share of about 70 per cent in the US and 50 per cent in Europe.
In the first six months of 1993, the US market for inhaled anaesthetics
declined by 4 per cent to Dollars 92m (Pounds 60m). Sales of Forane (the
patents of which expired in January) fell from Dollars 44m for the six
months to June 1992 to Dollars 27.3m. A generic version of Forane, known as
isoflurane, was launched by Abbott of the US in January and has captured a
22.7 per cent market share with sales to June of Dollars 21m.
Meanwhile, the US intravenous anaesthetic market was worth about Dollars 71m
during the first six months this year. Diprivan, with sales of Dollars 58m,
was up by 44 per cent on the same period last year; Zeneca's drug held a
market share of about 81 per cent. Diprivan's worldwide sales were Pounds
95m up to June, and brokers Goldman Sachs expect them to reach Pounds 375m a
year in 1996.
The objectives of anaesthesia are complex. Anaesthetics must enter the brain
and produce not only a profound sleep but also sedation to prevent movement
and to cause muscle relaxation and analgesia - the absence of pain - at
sufficient levels to leave the brain and body unaffected by surgery.
The exact way inhaled general anaesthetics work remains unclear. 'It's a
mystery still to be solved and there are a few Nobel prizes to be picked up
for this one,' says Iain Glen, a clinical scientist at Zeneca. The problem
is that there is no single target for drugs to create anaesthesia.
There have been two theories about how they work. The first, which has
recently been questioned by Nick Franks and Bill Lieb of Imperial College,
London, was that anaesthetics produced their effect by acting on the fat
layers on nerve membranes. These fat layers surround proteins that act as
channels for ions to pass through the membrane. The movement of positive and
negatively-charged ions is critical for electrical transmission from one
nerve to another.
However, Franks and Lieb have recently shown that anaesthetics have little
impact on the fat levels, but rather directly bind with the proteins. To
prove this, they experimented on North American fireflies. Fireflies contain
a class of proteins known as luciferase enzymes which are both
light-emitting and susceptible to anaesthetics. After administering
anaesthetics, the fireflies stopped flashing, demonstrating that the drug
was working directly on the protein. Luciferase is unconnected with
anaesthesia but the experiments show that anaesthetics can bind to a protein
and inhibit its biological function.
The action of intravenous agents such as Diprivan is even less understood.
Most probably, they stimulate chlorine channels, allowing negative ions into
the cells. This prevents the cells becoming charged positively, which is
required for electrical transmission between the nerves.
Meanwhile, a contest is shaping up between the recently launched quick
recovery products. The battleground is the market for out-patient surgery,
which is equivalent to about half of the anaesthetic market by value.
As for future developments, since the exact mechanism of anaesthesia is
still unknown, the most immediate research is likely to use the traditional
methods of screening rather than deliberate design. Zeneca looked at 5,000
compounds to find 300 with any effect, of which only one - Diprivan - was
safe. Similarly, BOC tested more than 500 molecules to find Suprane.
'Since the mechanisms are so poorly understood, it is difficult to improve
on what we have,' says Glen. Both Zeneca and BOC are looking for drugs that
have fewer side-effects on the cardiovascular system. BOC is looking for a
compound that is more effective in children - Suprane is pungent and
children do not like the smell.
Meanwhile, other companies are developing compounds. Glaxo is developing a
short-acting analgesic that can also be used for anaesthesia. The drug,
remifentanil, is in the same class as morphine and heroin, but can be
metabolised rapidly. This, Glaxo believes, will allow the drug's activity to
be turned on and off quickly, and so be used in day-case surgery.
Remifentanil will be registered with regulatory authorities in two to three
years.
In 1990, Maruishi Pharmaceutical launched its inhalation anaesthetic
Sevofrane in Japan where it captured 50 per cent of the domestic market. The
group has licensed the product to Abbott.
Whatever developments occur in anaesthesia, the speed at which surgeons
operate will remain critical. In the early 19th century surgeons had to be
quick because no anaesthetics were available - three minutes for an
amputation was a decent record. Now, with the benefits of micro-surgery and
innovative anaesthetics, they have to be quick to increase throughput and
reduce costs.
The series continues next month with an article on contraceptives.

Loyal sports fans who support their team from the stands throughout the
winter should soon have their own portable heating system.
Technology developer Battelle has got together with R G Barry, the home
footware specialists, to develop a pliable stadium seat which can retain its
heat of about 90'F for up to eight hours after being heated in a microwave
oven for just six minutes.
The breakthrough has been in the identification by Battelle of the material
capable of storing the heat and transferring it throughout the cushion.

<TEXT>
The increasing consumer demand for fresh foods has spurred Geest, the banana
company, to license a fresh soup-making technology from Stock Pot Soups of
Seattle.
At the heart of the technique is a return to the way soups are made in the
home - but on a massive scale. Trained chefs use vast cauldrons in which to
mix the meat and vegetables, held together in a classic roux.
A technical difficulty has been to transfer the soup into the stand-up
plastic pouches without pulverising the ingredients. To do this a valve has
been incorporated into the cauldron and the pouches, designed to withstand
the heat, are brought to the cauldron rather than the soup being squeezed
through a conventional production line process. The Fresh Soup Company, in
Spalding, Lincolnshire, will make the soups. The Fresh Soup Company: UK,

Computer screens which display three-dimensional graphics are relatively
commonplace, but manipulating the image so that it can be viewed from the
side or the top can involve complicated procedures with a keyboard or mouse.
Japanese electronics company NEC has overcome the problem with a screen
which is suspended from a flexible arm. By moving the screen - changing its
angle or height - the angle or viewpoint of the image on the screen changes
also. By physically moving the screen closer to the viewer the image is
magnified; by moving the screen away the image decreases in size on the thin
film transistor (TFT) display. NEC: Japan, 03 3789 6511.

Pattern recognition techniques developed for the Hungarian nuclear industry
are being applied to help police identify criminals.
An offshoot of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences has developed a palm and
fingerprint recognition system which uses the latest high-powered
workstations to quickly and accurately match the prints taken from a
suspected criminal with those held on record. The massive power means the
software can handle prints which are upside down or at an angle.
The system enables the police first to search a local database of images,
and then extend the search to a central database - all the databases are
networked together - if necessary. The system is marketed by Intelligent
Networks. Intelligent Networks: Hungary, 1 160 1221; UK, 071 972 0500.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the 1930s, an EMI engineer registered the first patent describing stereo
sound, writes Andrew Fisher. Sixty years later, Thorn EMI has developed what
it claims to be 'the most significant recording development since stereo'.
Called Sensaura, it uses digital signal processing and computers to create a
sound field which extends beyond the speakers, allowing the listener to hear
a more accurate aural version of the original performance.
No new equipment will be needed to hear CD or other recordings using
Sensaura. The technology, based on the way the human ear registers sound
waves to recognise their direction, uses an artificial head to make the
recordings.
Sensaura was developed by the group's Central Research Laboratories and has
been used in demonstration recordings, mainly classical. CRL: UK, 081 848

FT  15 OCT 93 / EC unity on social policy sought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission wants to do all it can to end Britain's isolation
from the rest of the European Community on social policy.
Mr Padraig Flynn, EC social affairs commissioner, speaking to a
Confederation of British Industry conference in London yesterday, said: 'I
believe we must continue to seek to progress social policy measures among
the 12 together.'
Under the deal negotiated by Mr John Major, the prime minister, Britain can
opt out of social regulations that the other 11 EC states may introduce in
the future.
But Mr Flynn warned the government that the EC would go ahead with its
proposed works council directive without UK involvement if European
employers and union organisations failed to reach agreement within nine
months on alternative non-legal information and consultation procedures for
workers in European trans-national companies.
'There is wide agreement between 11 member states on this point,' he added.
Mr Michael Forsyth, employment minister, told the CBI that it was 'quite
wrong' for the EC to go ahead with a directive on which there was total
disagreement between employers and unions.

LORD Chalfont, chairman of the Radio Authority, last night attacked the BBC
for its plan to replace Radio 5 with a news and sports radio network -
pre-empting next year's new national commercial channel, Raymond Snoddy
writes.
'How can we, in the independent sector, be expected to make rational plans
for broadening listener choice in the future?' he asked. The authority is
the watchdog for independent radio.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Watchdog warns on tendering: Civil service honesty 'at risk'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PARLIAMENT'S public expen-diture watchdog has warned the government that
civil service reforms such as market-testing and contracting out are
threatening standards of public honesty and accountability.
Sir John Bourn, head of the National Audit Office, says in his annual report
published today that private-sector organisations providing public services
need to learn the rules for handling public money and being more accountable
for their activities.
'If improved services are to be provided at less cost and under appropriate
control, public and private-sector cultures must blend rather than clash,'
he says. 'Enterprise and initiative should not be stifled by unnecessary
bureaucracy, but probity in the spending of public money must not be
sacrificed in the effort to get the job done.'
The NAO audits the accounts of almost 500 government departments, agencies
and quangos and examines their efficiency.
Sir John has been monitoring developments such as the creation of executive
agencies to deliver public services, changes in organisations to delegate
responsibility to line managers and the market-testing of civil service
work.
He sees four weaknesses in bringing private-sector disciplines to public
services:
Weak financial monitoring and controls. These led to 'major failings' in the
management of a Pounds 43m computer project in the Wessex Health Authority
area.
Lack of clear lines of responsibility and accountability. At the Welsh
Development Agency redundancy payments were made without approval from the
Welsh Office.
Conflicts of interest. In the Wessex case a member of the authority was
connected with a company tendering for computer equipment.
Improper application of financial controls. The Ministry of Defence made
Pounds 1.2m of irregular payments under an incentive award scheme.
The NAO saved the taxpayer Pounds 238m last year, up from Pounds 200m in
1991 and more than six times the cost of running the office.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Management buy-outs 'fall by a third'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGEMENT buy-out activ-ity fell steeply in the first six months of the
year, although it still accounted for just under half of all merger and
acquisition deals, according to figures published yesterday.
A total of 206 buy-outs and buy-ins were completed in the first half of the
year, a drop of more than one third on the same period last year and the
lowest half-yearly figure since 1987.
This decline in activity was due in part to the hopes of potential vendors
that economic recovery was imminent and that if they waited they could
obtain a better price for companies they sold.
The annual review from the Nottingham University Centre for Management
Buy-out Research also said that the end of the recession had reduced
pressure on companies to make distress sales of parts of their business.
Prospects for a short-term recovery were mixed, though in the longer term,
buy-out activity was expected to increase again, the review said.
The fall was less marked by value however and showed a drop of just over 10
per cent to Pounds 1.52bn.
One reason for the decline was an end to the shake-out which followed the
very active takeover market of the late 1980s.
Most of the divestment activity which had resulted was complete, the review
said.
Buy-ins, which involve outside managers joining a company, fell more sharply
than buy-outs in the first six months of this year.
Buy-in numbers were halved to just 38 deals. Middle range buy-outs, valued
at between Pounds 50m and Pounds 100m, also declined sharply. Deal
structures have changed with equity contributing a smaller share to overall
funding.
In small buy-outs worth less than Pounds 10m, equity stakes fell from
two-fifths to one-third. Vendors and managements contributed on average just
over 10 per cent of the total value of deals, the largest proportion since
the mid 1980s.
Buy-out companies accounted for one-fifth of all new companies coming to the
stock market in the first half of this year, the highest proportion ever.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Councils opt for Sunday trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL authorities in England and Wales want Sunday shopping to be
deregulated, a survey indicates today.
The findings, in a report by the Institute of Public Finance, will add
impetus to calls for reform when Sunday trading is debated in the next
session of parliament.
About 90 per cent of local authorities have adopted a 'passive or inactive'
stance to enforcing the existing regulations, the survey says.
Only a few authorities have been testing legislation in the courts. As
prosecutions and injunctions are few, net legal costs for authorities will
probably not exceed Pounds 250,000 in England and Wales this year, according
to the report.
Councils therefore fear that any change in the law except total deregulation
would lead to heavy extra costs because councils would need to take an
'active' stance.
Authorities were asked to pick one of five options including maintenance of
the status quo. Total deregulation was the first or second preference of 93
per cent, while partial deregulation, which would limit larger shops to six
hours on a Sunday, was the first or second choice of 59 per cent.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Rolls-Royce and ABB end power plant venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASEA Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, and Rolls-Royce, the
aero-engines and industrial power group, are ending their four-year
partnership created to seek contracts for UK gas-fired power stations.
ABB is paying an undisclosed sum for Rolls-Royce's 50 per cent stake in NEI
ABB Gas Turbines, the joint venture company based in Newcastle upon Tyne.
The venture, which was established in December 1989, was an important step
for both companies, which wanted to pursue opportunities created by the
privatisation of the electricity industry and the 'dash for gas'.
Rolls-Royce said yesterday it was concentrating on its relationship with
Westinghouse of the US - a main rival to ABB in the power plant business.
The two agreed a wide-ranging global-technology transfer, marketing and
co-operation deal last year.
The work formerly carried out by the joint venture, which employs 41 people,
will be included in ABB Power Plants, a company ABB is forming to cover its
UK power plant activities. This will be headed by Mr Alan Dixon, previously
managing director of the joint venture, and will still be based in
Newcastle.
The new company will take on the joint venture's main contract to build a
500MW combined cycle station at Deeside, north Wales, for National Power,
due for completion next year.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Parliament and Politics: Councils support Sunday shopping

<TEXT>
LOCAL authorities in England and Wales want Sunday shopping to be
deregulated, according to a survey published today.
The findings, in a report by the Institute of Public Finance, will add
impetus to calls for reform when Sunday trading is debated in the next
session of parliament.
About 90 per cent of local authorities have adopted a 'passive or inactive'
stance to enforcing the existing regulations, the survey says.
Most tend to allow a few authorities to make the running in testing
legislation in the courts. As prosecutions and injunctions are low, net
legal costs for authorities will probably not exceed Pounds 250,000 in
England and Wales this year, according to the report.
Councils therefore fear that any change in the law except total deregulation
would lead to heavy extra costs, because councils would need to take an
'active' stance.
Authorities were asked to pick one of five options, including maintenance of
the status quo. Total deregulation was the first or second preference of 93
per cent, while partial deregulation, which would limit larger shops to six
hours on a Sunday, was the first or second choice of 59 per cent.
The Shopping Hours Reform Council, which supports partial deregulation and
has the retailers Sainsbury, Tesco and Kingfisher among its members, said
total regulation was 'likely to fall at the first parliamentary hurdle'.
The IPF sent questionnaires to all local authorities in England and Wales,
and received responses from 45 per cent.
The president of the Law Society yesterday called for a public debate on the
abolition of English civil justice rules under which the loser of a legal
action must pay the winner's costs, Robert Rice writes.
Mr Rodger Pannone told the International Bar Association in New Orleans that
the rules were the last impediment to the introduction of 'no win, no pay'
contingency fee arrangements in England and Wales.
The rising cost of going to court - it now costs on average Pounds 1.25 to
recover Pounds 1 in damages - coupled with cuts in legal aid was
increasingly restrict-ing access to justice, he said.
Contingency fees offered the best hope of reversing that trend, but they
would not be greatly used if plaintiffs faced paying the costs of the other
side even though they would not have to pay their own.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Parliament and Politics: Chalfont attacks plan for Radio 5
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD Chalfont, chairman of the Radio Authority, last night attacked the BBC
for deciding to go ahead with a news and sports radio network in place of
Radio 5 - and pre-empting next year's new national commercial channel.
'If the BBC is able to pre-empt a format which certainly could be provided
by the commercial sector at no extra cost to the TV licence fee payer and
without narrowing listener choice, how can we, in the independent sector, be
expected to make rational plans for broadening listener choice in the
future?' he asked.
Lord Chalfont was speaking at a dinner in London to mark the 20th
anniversary of UK commercial radio, which the Radio Authority regulates.
Lord Chalfont said the BBC should have to stick to performance promises. 'No
independent radio station can change its format or its promise of
performance unless the change can be shown not to narrow the range of
programmes available,' he added.

FT  15 OCT 93 / City told to fund policing of markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITY companies were warned yesterday that they should be prepared to pay the
cost of policing market manipulation.
A conference at Westminster on City regulation also heard that companies
were to expect a crackdown on selective leaking of corporate information.
The warnings from senior regulators came at the same forum as a speech from
Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, in which he said he
had made representations in Brussels regarding the regulation of
cross-border payments in different currencies.
'I am concerned about the extent of double charging and the occasional lack
of transparency,' he said.
Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, said
companies which raised capital in the London markets and those which trade
securities should be prepared to pay for weeding out and punishing market
manipulators.
He said that detecting improper activity related to the prices of securities
and punishing wrongdoers is one of his principal tasks.
'We do insist that our market places should be seen to be the best policed
and most difficult for bad hats to get away with it,' he said. 'Would the
industry or issuers be prepared to contribute to the cost of ensuring that?
I believe they would. And I believe they should.'
The absence of a single body responsible for containing, deterring, and
punishing abuse has allowed different organisations to avoid responsibility
he said.
Meanwhile, Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of the Stock Exchange, warned
that he was determined to stop the practice of selective leaking of
corporate information to the marketplace. Earlier this year, the Stock
Exchange for the first time censured a company for disclosing exclusively to
a small group of analysts that its earnings would be lower than expected.
Sir Andrew said that when companies felt that market expectations were out
of line with reality there had been 'a growing tendency to nudge and wink
until the market - or some players - get the message'. He added: 'If
expectations are out of line, then an announcement to the market as a whole
is the way forward.'
Companies had been trying to avoid a sudden adverse reaction in their stock
price by selective leaking, he said. But if markets got used to such
announcements, the odds of an over-reaction in stock prices would be
diminished.
Imro, the self-regulating body for the fund management industry, has sent a
letter to members saying it no longer wishes to regulate the marketing of
packaged investment products such as unit trusts.
Mr Charles Nunneley, Imro chairman, said those activities should fall to the
Personal Investment Authority, the proposed self-regulatory body for retail
financial services.
However, those unit trust managers who are not concerned with mass marketing
of their products to the public will be able to remain in Imro and will not
need to belong to two self-regulatory bodies.
Imro's move increases the likelihood that the PIA will earn the support of
the large insurance companies which must vote to create it.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Consumer confidence at four-year high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSUMER confidence in the third quarter was at its highest level for more
than four years, according to a survey published yesterday which suggests
the recovery is becoming better established.
The rise in consumer spending, which has been a big factor behind the past
year's upturn, is 'increasingly robust' with southern England leading the
way, says the report by Business Strategies, an economic consultancy, and
the Gallup market research group.
Low interest rates, reduced unemployment and signs of a better economic
climate are boosting people's willingness to spend, apparently offsetting
gloomy news elsewhere in the economy.
Negative factors are that many people are worried about the Pounds 6.8bn of
higher taxes announced for the next financial year. Also, more individuals
than earlier in the year expect inflationary pressures to rise over the next
few months.
The index of consumer confidence based on answers to questions put to 6,000
people throughout Britain gave a figure of 16 in the third quarter of this
year, up from 11 in the second quarter and 4 in the first quarter. The last
time it was higher was in the first three months of 1989.
Optimism about the economic climate is highest in south-east England - in
spite of this region having suffered particularly badly during the recession
in terms of unemployment and a fall in house prices.
According to estimates by Business Strategies, consumer spending in
south-east England outside London increased by 1.9 per cent in the year to
the third quarter, higher than the figure for Britain as a whole of 1.6 per
cent.
Other regions with particularly high rises in consumer spending over this
period were south-west England, East Anglia and north-west England. These
saw increases of 2.8 per cent, 2 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively.
Mr David Fell, a director of Business Strategies, said all regions were
sharing in the general rise in consumer confidence. However, optimism could
still slip back, for example in the event of the government announcing a
further large increase in taxation for 1994-95 in next month's Budget.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Rate cut 'could re-ignite inflation'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH CLARKE, the chancellor, is warned today that a cut in interest
rates in the near future 'may be difficult to justify' on the grounds that
it could re-ignite strong inflationary pressures.
According to Professor David Currie, a member of Mr Clarke's panel of
economic advisers and head of economic forecasting at the London Business
School, anything other than a modest cut in interest rates around the time
of the Budget could increase the chances of inflation pushing through the
Treasury's ceiling.
Writing in the school's latest Economic Outlook, Prof Currie says the
chancellor should tighten fiscal policy by up to Pounds 4bn in the Budget.
This would reassure financial markets that Britain is tackling the large
public sector deficit and would help interest rates to remain relatively low
in the long term.
In spite of Prof Currie's worries about inflation, he believes Mr Clarke
will cut interest rates by 0.5 of a percentage point to 5.5 per cent near
the Budget, to compensate for the demand-sapping effects of the expected
fiscal tightening.
Prof Currie says the UK recovery is well established though it will be
'relatively sluggish', partly because of weak demand for exports.
He thinks gross domestic product this year will grow by a fairly healthy 1.6
per cent.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Fragile upturn looms over Clarke meeting: Why big decisions
on the Budget will be postponed until next month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BROAD issues of strategy rather than detail are expected to be at the centre
of today's internal Treasury discussions on the Budget at Dorneywood, in
Buckinghamshire.
With just over six weeks to go before Britain's first unified Budget on
November 30, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is decamping from London
with his ministerial team and top officials.
They will gather against a background of less favourable economic data than
when they held a similar meeting at the end of July.
Although yesterday's news of a 13,600 drop in seasonally-adjusted
unemployment in September suggests that the economy is continuing to grow,
the recovery has come to look more patchy and fragile.
A sharp drop in exports in July, the fall in manufacturing output over the
summer and the upwards creep of inflationary pressures in the high street
and at the factory gate in recent months have upset earlier theories that
inflation is dead - or that Britain was enjoying a 'near perfect' recovery
based on rising investment and sales abroad.
Although Professor Alan Budd, the government's chief economic adviser, will
tell today's meeting that the economy is on track to grow by perhaps 1.8 per
cent rather than the 1.25 per cent real-growth forecast for this year in the
March Budget, he will warn that the weak economic performance of many
continental European economies poses a threat to recovery.
Mr Clarke has often said that he will leave the final decisions on the
Budget until next month, when he will have the most up-to-date information
on the development of the economy. The recent unclear signals will reinforce
that inclination.
The chancellor will be joined by his four Treasury ministers - including Mr
Michael Portillo, the chief secretary, and Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial
secretary. His two special advisers, Mrs Tessa Keswick and Mr David Roughly,
will be there to remind him of the political ramifications of any proposed
moves.
The small group of top Treasury officials will be headed by Sir Terence
Burns, the permanent secretary. It will also include Mr Andrew Turnbull,
second permanent secretary in charge of public spending, and possibly Sir
Nigel Wicks, the second permanent secretary in charge of finance and the
Treasury's 'foreign minister'.
Mr Robert Culpin, the senior official in charge of fiscal policy, will be
present with a list of possible revenue raising measures for the Budget.
Possible further curtailment of mortgage interest relief is one of the
options under consideration.
The inclusion of Sir Anthony Battishill, the chairman of the board of the
Inland Revenue, in the list of officials attending the Dorneywood talks, is
a sign that they are likely to focus on taxation rather than government
spending.
The EDX cabinet committee, charged with keeping government spending within
its Pounds 254bn 'control total' for 1994-95, held a meeting yesterday but
has not completed its negotiations.
With more EDX meetings due next week, the Dorneywood gathering may not wish
to delve too deeply into public expenditure issues.
On the other hand, there are always tax changes, including moves to close
loopholes or smooth administration, that the Inland Revenue wishes to have
included in the Budget.
This stage of the pre-Budget deliberations is a good time for considering
and trimming the Inland Revenue's wish list, before the politically-charged
tax decisions are finally decided by the chancellor next month.
The chancellor has hinted repeatedly that he believes taxes will have to
rise to make a significant dent in the public sector borrowing requirement,
which the Treasury estimates at about Pounds 50bn for 1993-94.
He has made no secret of his preference for indirect rather than direct
taxes and his belief that the tax system should encourage business activity,
investment and savings.
But Mr Clarke will be leaving until November his all-important judgment on
how much, if anything at all, the government should take out of the economy
to narrow the deficit.
That judgment, made in the light of the next month's economic developments,
will determine the shape and content of his first Budget.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Accountant fined by regulators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PARTNER in the insolvency division of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the UK's largest
accountancy firm, has been reprimanded by his regulatory body for breaches
of the law and of professional guidelines.
Mr Adrian Stanway, based in Coopers' London office, was fined Pounds 3,500
and ordered to pay Pounds 1,750 in costs by the professional conduct
committee of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.
The action was brought in relation to his work as liquidator to JDC Stokes
Civil Engineering between February 1990 and October last year.
At a meeting held in August, details of which have just been made public,
the disciplinary committee ruled that Mr Stanway failed to hold an annual
creditors' meeting in accordance with Section 105 of the Insolvency Act
1986.
It also ruled that he had breached the minimum standard of insolvency
practice resulting in delays and unanswered correspondence from a creditor.
Mr Stanway admitted the faults, arguing that although he had been partner in
charge of the case, he had no personal control over the company's file and
that there had been a systems breakdown and human error in the office.
Coopers said it had taken disciplinary action against a manager and other
staff in its Southampton office in connection with the case. It is believed
Coopers will pay Mr Stanway's fine and plans no action against him. In
separate proceedings announced yesterday, Mr Frank Shannon, a former finance
director of Nissan UK, was excluded from membership of the institute. He was
sentenced to three years imprisonment in July after he admitted cheating the
Inland Revenue.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Policing insider dealing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CENTRAL enforcement agency should be created to police insider dealing, a
seminar of stockbrokers and company finance directors was told yesterday,
Tim Burt writes.
The agency would also clarify guidelines on price sensitive information,
said Mr Michael Ashe, a barrister and expert on insider dealing. It would
combine the work of the Crown Prosecution Service, and the Securities and
Investment Board and other self-regulating organisations.
Mr Ashe's call was backed by Mr Richard Lines, investigations manager at the
Stock Exchange's surveillance department, who agreed there was a need for
such an agency.
Speaking at a seminar in Birmingham, Mr Ashe said: 'There has been a problem
with enforcement in the securities industry. It's time to have a single
agency.'

FT  15 OCT 93 / Jobless total falls to 11-month low: All regions improve -
High street spending 'robust' / Treasury strategy talks today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNEMPLOYMENT dropped to its lowest level for almost a year in September,
reversing the rises of the previous two months.
The number of people out of work and claiming benefit fell by a
seasonally-adjusted 13,600, bringing the total last month to 2.908m or 10.3
per cent of the workforce - the lowest level for 11 months. Unadjusted
unemployment fell 47,834 to 2.912m.
The drop was spread across the country, with the sharpest falls occurring in
the north-west and Scotland.
Male unemployment fell by 10,200, and female by 3,400. The respective rates
are now 13.9 per cent and 5.6 per cent of the workforce.
Unemployment has fallen by a total of 84,000 since the beginning of the
year.
Although the UK has the eighth highest unemployment rate in the
industrialised world, Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, said the
latest figures showed that the UK was 'bucking the trend'.
He added: 'While unemployment continues to rise generally across Europe,
unemployment is falling in the UK and is now below the (European Community)
average.' The EC average is 10.4 per cent.
Seasonally-adjusted figures show that there are fewer people joining the
unemployment count and more leaving it than earlier this year.
Some 358,800 joined the count in September - 15,100 fewer than in August and
the lowest number since May. Those leaving the count totalled 376,500 - a
4,000 improvement on August and the highest figure since October last year.
However, the number of people employed in manufacturing industries dropped
to 4.17m in August - down 24,000 compared with July.
Since the beginning of the year manufacturing employment has shrunk by
153,000 but this compares with 229,000 over the same period last year.
A drop of 700 in the month of unfilled vacancies at Jobcentres - about one
third of all vacancies in the economy - represented a setback since a drop
tends to point to tighter labour conditions in the future.
But in the three months to September, vacancies in-creased on average by
2,500 compared with 1,500 in the three months to August.
The rise in underlying average earnings was 3.5 per cent in the year to
August - unchanged from the previous month. The rate was also the same for
the service sector where earnings rose an underlying 2.75 per cent. For
manufacturing there was a slight drop from 5 per cent to 4.75 per cent.
The 0.6 per cent fall in manufacturing unit wage costs in the three months
to August was the smallest fall this year.
There was also a slowdown in productivity growth, reflecting the drop in
manufacturing output in the three months to August.
Productivity grew a seasonally-adjusted 5.1 per cent in the three months to
August, compared with the previous three months. This compares with 6.7 per
cent in the three months to July and a high of 7.8 per cent in the three
months to March.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Private mines bid withdrawn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RJB Mining yesterday with-drew a bid to resume mining at Bevercotes,
Nottinghamshire, amid growing doubts that private-sector companies will
rescue more than a handful of the 20 pits closed by British Coal in the past
six months.
RJB's decision ends any hopes of salvation for Bevercotes, as British Coal
has received no other bid to mine it under licence.
It means that just six of the 19 pits put out to tender so far are the
subject of a bid which involves mining. Analysts believe it unlikely that
all six will resume mining. Betws, in south Wales, is considered the most
likely to re-open because of its valuable anthracite coal deposits.
The other five pits - Rossington and Markham Main in Yorkshire, Clipstone in
Nottinghamshire, Trentham near Stoke-on-Trent, and Coventry, near Keresley -
will have to compete with surviving British Coal mines for markets.
Bevercotes is the second pit at which RJB has withdrawn a bid, having
initially tendered for five of the 19. The company would not comment
yesterday because of the confidentiality requirements of bidding.
However British Coal said RJB's decision was made after a 'further
evaluation of the mining and commercial prospects of the pit'.
British Coal also announced detailed talks with companies which have lodged
tenders for Rossington and Markham Main. They are each the subject of two
bids, from RJB and Edwards Energy, led by Mr Malcolm Edwards, former British
Coal commercial director.

INVESTIGATIONS into insurance fraud have increased sharply say loss
adjusters, who examine claims on behalf of insurance companies.
The Chartered Institute of Loss Adjusters says the time spent on
investigations has increased by an average of 30 per cent this year.
The institute said that one of the main reasons for the increase was the
adoption of tighter procedures by insurance companies who have been hit by
an epidemic of fraudulent claims in recent years.

FT  15 OCT 93 / World Cup loss could cost Pounds 35m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER the national side lost 2-0 to The Netherlands on Wednesday night,
English football could lose up to Pounds 20m if Graham Taylor's team fails
to qualify for next year's World Cup finals in the US, Diane Summers writes.
Failure would cost the travel industry an estimated Pounds 15m, and there
would also be losses in publishing and broadcasting, gaming and to companies
associated with football merchandising.
Mr Trevor Phillips, the Football Association's commercial director, said the
FA would forgo between Pounds 3m and Pounds 4m in receipts and as much as
Pounds 20m could be lost to football as a whole, including a drop in takings
on gates during the season after the cup.
Greaves Travel, FA official travel agent, said that reductions in bookings
to the US next year would mean a loss of up to Pounds 15m for the travel
industry as a whole.
However, Mr Michael Myers, marketing director, said that inquiries from the
corporate market was holding up and there could actually be a boost to
family holidays in the US. 'Families can now go knowing they won't be mixed
up with that kind of supporter,' he said.
American Airlines, official airline to the World Cup, is suspending
television and press advertising because of the negative association with
the competition. It was 'deemed to be insensitive in the short term' to
advertise, said the airline, although it did not plan to cut its promotion
budgets overall.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK subsidiary of International Business Machines, the world's largest
computer manufacturer, is spending Pounds 3m over the next 18 months on a
campaign to persuade top executives that mainframe computers have a future.
Sales of mainframes, costing Pounds 1m or more, have been steadily declining
for years. IBM UK has been particularly hard hit, losing more than Pounds
600m in 1992. Mr Arthur Parker, director of the UK company's mainframe
division, said the decline in mainframe revenues had been halted. IBM's
profitability depends, however, on customers finding new uses for
mainframes.
The campaign aims to persuade executives that mainframes have a role in
future systems.
A survey, commissioned by IBM and carried out by Cranfield School of
Management, concludes that chief executives believe mainframes are essential
but unexciting. It says: 'Chief executives feel far less intimidated by
information technology than they used to. As a result, they demand more from
their systems, want commercial solutions, not 'products' and want the focus
set firmly on end users.'
Companies have recently been buying networks of smaller computers, which may
cost more to run, rather than mainframes.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Lloyd's proposals anger Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOSS-MAKING Names at Lloyd's of London have reacted angrily to new proposals
that would radically reduce their influence at the insurance market in the
run-up to the planned admission of corporate capital next year.
The move could influence Names - the individuals whose assets support the
market - to reject rule changes necessary for the new corporate members, at
a decisive extraordinary general meeting next week, say leaders of the loss
makers.
A consultative document issued earlier this week proposes that voting rights
should be more closely linked to the size of capital committed. This step
would be favoured by new investors.
The document also suggests that those Names who are no longer actively
underwriting at Lloyd's should have less voting power than active Names. But
many of the less active Names are trapped in the market because of their
participation in syndicates which have past years of account left 'open'
because of uncertainty over future claims
Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker Names Action Group, one of
the largest organisations of loss-making Names with about 3,000 members,
said: 'This is completely outrageous. It turns us into a tiny minority of
the Lloyd's electorate.' The Treasury yesterday announced proposed taxation
arrangements for corporate members at Lloyd's.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary, said the rules 'should be broadly
consistent with those that currently apply to corporate insurers generally'.
Unlike individual Names, corporate members will not be able to set aside
funds in a special reserve. However, the Treasury said 'further
consideration' would be given to the matter in the light of responses to the
consultative document on equalisation reserves for corporate insurers.

THE BANKING Appeals Tribunal is expected today to reject a complaint against

Mount Banking asked the tribunal to examine the reasons for the Bank of
England's petition to a High Court judge which led to it being placed in
provisional liquidation in October last year.
The tribunal's findings are expected to be circulated in a report today
after hearings held last month.
The tribunal is believed to have been the first to sit since it was

FT  15 OCT 93 / BAe to shed 1,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALMOST 1,000 jobs are being cut by British Aerospace across four plants in
England and Scotland, underlining the difficulties the company is having in
depressed world markets for aircraft and defence equipment.
The loss-making Jetstream turbo-prop section, based in Prestwick, Scotland,
will lose 630 jobs while 352 jobs will go at BAe's Royal Ordnance
subsidiary.
BAe blamed a lack of orders and said although volunteers would be sought,
compulsory redundancies were likely.
At Prestwick the cuts will involve about 460 staff and 170 sub-contractors
out of a total of 2,500 workers.
The Royal Ordnance cuts are spread over three sites: 120 out of 150 jobs are
to go at Wescott, near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, and a further 70 out of
600 at Summerfield, near Kidderminster, Hereford and Worcester. Both sites
make rocket motors.
A plant at Blackburn, Lancashire, which does mechanical and electrical work
on military vehicles and armaments, will lose 162 jobs from a total of 375.
BAe said that the job losses were the result of 'a lack of orders and a
slowing down of Ministry of Defence spending'.
It said further job losses were possible unless the Treasury allowed the MoD
to proceed with a Pounds 250m ammunition order.
At Prestwick, the company says it believes the level of redundancies will be
sufficient to restore the plant's competitiveness. It expects the market
will turn up in 18 months to two years.
But it acknowledged that an alliance with another manufacturer as part of an
industry-wide rationalisation could mean further changes at Prestwick,
though probably not more job losses.
Jetstream blames the need for redundancies on a severe shortage of orders.
It is building some aircraft for which it has no orders and wants to scale
back production.
In June Mr Allan MacDonald, Jetstream's managing director, urged that the 11
worldwide manufacturers of commuter airliners needed to rationalise their
output. Since then Jetstream and other companies have been talking about
possible alliances but no deals have been reached.
Jetstream believes it is well placed for any joint venture because it
considers its Prestwick plant is efficient and it has successful aircraft.
Prestwick builds the 19-seat Jetstream 31 and the 29-seat Jetstream 41. It
also builds the 64-seat Jetstream ATP, whose production was recently
transferred from Woodford near Manchester. Programmes to build two other
models, the 72-seat Jetstream 71 and a 50-seat Jetstream 51, are to be
launched by January.
Likely European partners for an alliance include the Franco-Italian
consortium ATR and the Spanish company Casa.
ATR already builds successful turbo-prop aircraft in the same category as
Jetstream's ATP, and Casa is planning an aircraft in that category.
BAe did not provide for redundancies at Jetstream in the Pounds 1bn
restructuring provision it made earlier this year.
It said it was too early to estimate the cost of the redundancies at
Prestwick.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Iraq probe may urge change in use of MI6 data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COMPREHENSIVE review of the way intelligence is handled in Whitehall will
be one of the main outcomes of the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry, senior
Foreign Office officials believe.
Such a review would be the first since the reform of the Joint Intelligence
Committee, the main Whitehall body responsible for security, after the
Falklands War. It is likely to focus on the quality of intelligence data,
its handling by the committee and other Whitehall departments, and the
relationship between civil servants and ministers.
Documents made available to Lord Justice Scott show that in spite of earlier
reforms recommended by Lord Franks, lack of co-ordination and in some cases
misuse of intelligence data for apparently political ends have continued
throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s.
Foreign Office officials blame officials and ministers in the Ministry of
Defence and Department of Trade and Industry for not including intelligence
data in their decision-making process. Both the MoD and the DTI were
generally in favour of promoting arms exports to Iraq.
Mr William Waldegrave, a Foreign Office minister between July 1988 and
November 1990 and now public services minister, on Tuesday defended the
secret services.
In evidence to the inquiry he appeared to blame other members of the
government, not necessarily his own officials, for not passing on
intelligence which might have helped his efforts to block defence-related
exports to Iraq.
The views of intelligence officers are being heard in private by Lord
Justice Scott. However, a senior source close to MI6 accepted this week that
the machinery for intelligence-gathering within Whitehall was not
necessarily efficient.
He added that MI6 regularly produced longer and detailed reports on specific
subjects which should be channelled through the Whitehall machinery and
through regional departments to all the ministers concerned in the area. The
intelligence on Iraq is expected to be shared by officials with
responsibility for vetting arms exports to Iraq and formulating policy on
the Middle East.
Mr Waldegrave told the inquiry that a 14-page MI6 report from September 1989
detailing the involvement of companies in the Iraqi military procurement
network was among the intelligence data not made available to him.
Last night Ms Elizabeth Symons, general secretary of the Association of
First Division Civil Servants, the union for middle- and high-ranking civil
servants, defended her members. She said: 'I think Mr Waldegrave was not
blaming Whitehall officials but government. What I understood by his
statement to Scott was that there was intelligence information which was
held by other ministers but which was not shared.'

FT  15 OCT 93 / Whistle-blowers win friendly ear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYEES worried about fraud or malpractice in the workplace have been
offered legal advice from a new charity. The organisation believes it could
help expose corporate frauds or avert disasters by advising
'whistle-blowers' in the workplace.
Public Concern at Work, which was launched yesterday, is offering advice for
employees worried about being victimised if they take concerns to their
employers. The group hopes that its work will help alert companies or
regulators to problems much earlier.
Sir Gordon Borrie, former director-general of fair trading and chairman of
the charity's trustees, said it would provide confidential legal advice
which would be protected by lawyer-client privilege.
He said: 'Time and again official inquiries into scandals, disasters and
tragedies show they could have been avoided if employees had spoken up in
time, or if those in charge had addressed the concerns of staff when they
were raised.'
He cited the multi-billion dollar fraud at the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International, The Herald of Free Enterprise ferry disaster and the
Leicestershire child abuse case involving Mr Frank Beck, the children's
homes director, as cases which might have been avoided had the concerns of
employees been recognised.
Sir Gordon stressed that clients would 'remain in the driving seat' and the
charity would advise them of their legal positions and the most effective
way of raising an issue.
The charity, he said, 'should make it less likely that employees will turn a
blind eye to serious malpractice and more likely that employers will be able
to address real problems before damage is done'.
The organisation, which will also provide advice and research reports for
employers, arose out of research by Ms Marlene Winfield, one of the
trustees, whose book, Minding Your Own Business, advocated the role of
whistle-blowers.
She said that of 53 British companies asked, only two had a fixed procedure
that assured employees of either confidentiality or protection against
retaliation. Yet most had felt that there were circumstances where
whistle-blowing would be justified.
'The gap between belief and practice was yawning, and still is,' she said.
'Speak to the boss and possibly lose your job, your pension, your mortgage,
the trust of your colleagues.'

FT  15 OCT 93 / Engineering employers hit at Treasury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ENGINEERING Employ-ers Federation yesterday accused the Treasury of
being 'isolated from the real world' of manufacturing, and warned that the
recovery in engineering output had halted.
The gloomy assessment of the sector's prospects - including a prediction of
a further 60,000 job losses - underlined the severity of the recession in
continental European export markets, and confirmed the message of falling
manufacturing output contained in official figures on Tuesday.
The federation said engineering output is not expected to pick up again
before next spring. Mr Ian Thompson, economic adviser, said there were no
prospects of a strong recovery in west European markets until 1995.
The forecast prompted an outspoken attack on the Treasury by Mr Neil
Johnson, director-general of the federation, who was worried not only by the
short-term outlook but by the long-term future of the engineering sector.
Mr Johnson said the federation still had high hopes for Mr Kenneth Clarke,
the chancellor. 'But I fear the Treasury may be trapping him, as it has
trapped so many of his predecessors,' he said.
Treasury officials were clever, perhaps too clever, he said. But they were
isolated from the real world and 'totally unspoilt by failure'.
'They cannot sail serenely on, seeing what they want to see, understanding
what they want to understand, and dismissing we little wealth-creating folk
with a gentle, patrician smile,' he added.
Underlying Mr Johnson's attack is the federation's belief that the UK does
not have a broad enough manufacturing base to satisfy domestic demand and
exports - especially when demand in continental markets recovers.
He said that if Mr Clarke was serious about boosting the UK's manufacturing
base, he should change the UK's system of capital allowances for industry,
which is 'biased against investment'. The federation believes UK gross
domestic product will grow by little more than 2 per cent next year. This
compares with a consensus among City and economic analysts of 3 per cent.
European recession and the continuing squeeze on costs because of global
competition would cause the 60,000 further job cuts in the next 12 months.
Employment in the sector has already fallen by 410,000 to 1.69m since the
first half of 1990.

THE OFFICE of Fair Trading yesterday cleared The Times of predatory pricing
over its controversial 15p price cut to 30p on weekdays.
A formal complaint was made against the newspaper by The Independent which
has apparently suffered little if any circulation loss because of The Times
price cut.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said: 'I am satisfied,
on the basis of the information available, that the reduction in the cover
price of The Times reflects a calculated commercial decision by News
International (publisher of The Times) which I would not be justified in
treating as predatory.'

FT  15 OCT 93 / Ex-MoD Tory calls for Ulster troops cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FORMER Tory minister called last night for a cut in the number of British
troops in Northern Ireland. His comments threatened to weaken the
Conservative party's recently cemented understanding with the Ulster
unionists, David Owen writes.
Mr Archie Hamilton, the former armed forces minister, said British forces in
the province could be cut by a battalion - equivalent to about 600 men -
every year.
Maintaining the UK's commitment at present levels was limiting the
government's ability to deploy troops elsewhere, he told a Defence Institute
meeting in London.
His remarks were opposed by Ulster unionist MPs, with Mr Ken Maginnis,
Official Ulster Unionist party security spokesman, saying they were an
admission of Mr Hamilton's 'incompetence'.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Streamlined school tests published
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REPLACEMENTS for the national curriculum tests that were boycotted this year
by teachers' unions were published yesterday to a divided reaction from
teachers.
The new tests for 14-year-olds are drastically altered from last year,
accommodating complaints about the workload they created for teachers and
attacks on their educational validity.
Mr Chris Woodhead, chief executive of the Schools Curriculum and Assessment
Authority, which has replaced the National Curriculum Council and the
Schools Examination and Assessment Council, said the tests were 'strong and
rigorous'.
The tests have been streamlined, with English reduced from three papers
lasting four hours to two lasting two hours and 45 minutes. Mathematics and
science are both reduced from three one-hour papers to two papers of one
hour.
According to the Department for Education, the tests confirm the policy of
slimming down the curriculum.
Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said:
'The boycott remains in place. The government has regularly produced
estimates of the time the assessment and testing will take. It has always
been wrong.'
The Association of Teachers and Lecturers was more positive. Ms Gillian
Wood, assistant general secretary, gave the tests 'a broad welcome'.

FT  15 OCT 93 / EC to seek unity on social policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission wants to do all it can to end Britain's isolation
from the rest of the EC on social policy.
That was the message from Mr Padraig Flynn, EC social affairs commissioner,
to a Confederation of British Industry conference in London yesterday.
'I believe we must continue to seek to progress social policy measures among
the 12 together,' he told his business audience. 'The social protocol of the
Maastricht treaty will be for the commission an instrument of last resort.'
Under the deal negotiated by Mr John Major, the prime minister, Britain can
opt out of social regulations that the other 11 Community states may
introduce in the future.
But Mr Flynn warned the British government that the EC would go ahead with
its proposed works council directive without Britain's involvement if
European employers and trade union organisations failed to reach agreement
within nine months on alternative non-legal information and consultation
procedures for workers in European trans-national companies.
In contrast, Mr Michael Forsyth, the employment minister, told the CBI that
it was 'quite wrong for the Community to go ahead with a directive on which
there was total dis-agreement between Europe's employers and unions'.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Appeal against Bank set to be lost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANKING Appeals Tribunal is expected today to reject a complaint against
the Bank of England for petitioning to close Mount Banking, a small
Asian-owned bank.
Mount Banking asked the tribunal to examine the reasons for the Bank of
England's petition to a High Court judge which led to it being placed in
provisional liquidation in October last year.
The tribunal's findings are expected to be circulated in a report today
after hearings held last month under the auspices of the Lord Chancellor's
department.
It was chaired by Mr Jonathon Mance QC, with two 'wing' members: Mr
Christopher Swinson, an accountant, and Mr Nicholas Clegg, a banker.
The tribunal is believed to have been the first to sit since it was
instituted as part of an appeals process in the 1987 Banking Act.
Previous cases have been launched but all have been settled before a
tribunal has been formally convened.
The appeal was requested by the principal shareholders in Mount, Mr
Navinchandra Bhagwanji Shah and Mr Suresh Bhagwanji Shah.
The findings are expected to generate interest from critics of the Bank of
England's regulatory role, who are sceptical of the tribunal's independence.

MR ROSS PEROT, the Texas billionaire, is refusing comment on a report that
he will pitch his political organisation, United We Stand, and his extensive
resources behind opposition to a Uruguay Round agreement, Nancy Dunne writes
from Washington.
A spokesman for United We Stand said he has not yet taken a position on the
Round, in order to focus his energies on defeating the North American Free
Trade Agreement. Mr Perot co-wrote a book detailing criticism of Nafta after
claiming, during the presidential debates, that 'a giant sucking sound'
would draw American jobs over the US-Mexican border.
His co-author, Mr Pat Choate, yesterday said he opposed Uruguay Round
provisions weakening US dumping laws and establish-ing a multilateral
trading organisation to oversee the world trading system.
Ms Lori Wallach, a prominent anti-Nafta organiser with Public Citizen, which
works closely with the Perot forces, said many of the same groups which
oppose the Nafta will also fight a Uruguay Round pact.
'Ross Perot feels about Nafta the way a vampire feels about garlic,' she
said. 'Ross Perot feels about Gatt the way a vampire feels about daylight.
One he regards with revulsion; the other means death.'

POWER Corp of Canada, the big financial services and communications group,
has linked with Hydro-Quebec and Ontario Hydro to form Asia Power, to
develop large electric power projects in China and other fast-developing
Asian countries.
Asia Power, owned one-third each by the partners and initially capitalised
at CDollars 100m (Pounds 49.2m), will have headquarters in Montreal but
operate from Hong Kong.
China early this year finally reversed its policy discouraging foreign
investment in infrastructure, including electric power. It is desperately
short of power for industrial development and estimates it needs Dollars
25bn (Pounds 16.5bn) in foreign investment in the area over the next eight
years.
Mr Paul Desmarais, chairman of Power Corp, which controls Pargesa with the
Belgian Frere family, has visited China regularly since 1979 and dropped
plans for a Guangdong pulp and paper mill because of lack of power.
He brought China International Trust &amp; Investment into a big British
Columbia pulp and paper project later. Power Corp now plans a China
communications project with Citic.
Canada led a Dollars 100m technical study of key parts of the Dollars 15bn
Three Gorges hydro project in China during the 1980s and Hydro-Quebec has
helped design several smaller hydro projects being built. Ontario Hydro has
also played an advisory role in China.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Anglo-American consortium which is poised to break into eastern
Germany's energy industry must decide by today if it will accept the deal to
buy the country's second largest brown coal field.
The Treuhand privatisation agency has set this deadline amid concerns that
Britain's PowerGen, a big partner in the consortium, is reconsidering its
stake in the mining operation.
PowerGen's board agreed to the contract on Wednesday to acquire a 40 per
cent stake in a power generating plant at Schkopau, near Leipzig. This will
give the consortium access to the high-voltage grid run by Veag, eastern
Germany's main utility company, and a strategic foothold in eastern
Germany's lucrative energy sector.
Schkopau will be fuelled by Mitteldeutsche Braunkohle (Mibrag), the giant
lignite fields which the consortium is supposed to be buying from the
Treuhand, and over which PowerGen is reported to be having second thoughts.
'It would be madness for any side to pull out at this stage,' a banker
involved in the negotiations said. 'If PowerGen is worried that energy
demand will not be sufficient to consume the amount of coal it mines, they
should think again. Mibrag has secured long-term coal contracts.'
NRG of Minneapolis and Morrison Knudsen of Idaho, the two other consortium
partners, want to wrap up the 18 months of talks on Mibrag.

FT  15 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Audio-visual trade fears 'unfounded'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, yesterday sought to allay the loudly-voiced fears of European
broadcasters and film-makers that inclusion of audio-visual services in a
world trade agreement would destroy their industry.
He said in a statement that the debate on the potential effect on the
audio-visual sector of the Uruguay Round global trade talks was proceeding
on the basis of 'some serious misunderstandings'.
'The big question is, does anything in the Uruguay Round require that the
European market be opened up to such an extent that European - and
particularly, non-English-language - film-making will be destroyed? The
answer has to be a resounding 'no'.'
There was nothing in the proposed services accord that envisaged
deregulation, let alone total deregulation, of any sector and there was
nothing to prevent governments from subsidising films and other audio-visual
projects, he said.
Mr Sutherland's unusual intervention reflects Gatt's anxieties that the
Uruguay Round services agreement is being inaccurately targeted for
criticism in what is essentially a bilateral argument between the US and the
European Community.
Under the draft services agreement, countries bargain with one another on
which sectors they will liberalise and by how much. In these negotiations
the US has called for the scrapping of European quotas on foreign
broadcasting material and films, which it says unfairly restrict sales by
American producers. France and other European nations argue that the quotas
are needed to preserve Europe's culture and values from wholesale takeover
by Hollywood.
The US film and television industry, the country's second biggest export
industry after aircraft, has a turnover of about Dollars 40bn (Pounds
26.4bn) a year and represents about 40 per cent of the world market. Exports
to the EC amounted to Dollars 3.6bn in 1992, against EC exports to the US
market of Dollars 288m, and American films account for over 70 per cent of
European box-office takings.
France has pressed for audio-visual services to be excluded altogether from
any Uruguay Round accord. However, most EC member states and Sir Leon
Brittan, the European Community's trade commissioner, favour the sector's
inclusion with special treatment in recognition of its 'cultural
specificity'. Mr Sutherland said yesterday that a general cultural exception
had already been considered in the Uruguay Round negotiations and rejected.

President Clinton yesterday told representatives of the US film industry
that open markets for audio-visual industries must be included in any final
Uruguay Round agreement.
Mr Jack Valenti, head of the US Motion Picture Association, said the White
House was preparing to issue a statement that any deal must be 'fair and
just to American audio-visual'.
Mr Valenti was upset about French taxes on films which are used to subsidise
the French film industry. 'About 60 per cent of the subsidy money is taken
from theatres showing American films. We deserve a share of that.'

FT  15 OCT 93 / World Trade News: PowerGen may quit E German mine deal

<TEXT>
THE Anglo-American consortium which is poised to break into eastern
Germany's energy industry must decide by today if it will accept the deal to
buy the country's second largest brown coal field.
The Treuhand privatisation agency has set this deadline amid concerns that
Britain's PowerGen, a big partner in the consortium, is reconsidering its
stake in the mining operation.
PowerGen's board agreed to the contract on Wednesday to acquire a 40 per
cent stake in a power generating plant at Schkopau, near Leipzig. This will
give the consortium access to the high-voltage grid run by Veag, eastern
Germany's main utility company, and a strategic foothold in eastern
Germany's lucrative energy sector.
Schkopau will be fuelled by Mitteldeutsche Braunkohle (Mibrag), the giant
lignite fields which the consortium is supposed to be buying from the
Treuhand, and over which PowerGen is reported to be having second thoughts.
'It would be madness for any side to pull out at this stage,' a banker
involved in the negotiations said. 'If PowerGen is worried that energy
demand will not be sufficient to consume the amount of coal it mines, they
should think again. Mibrag has secured long-term coal contracts.'
NRG of Minneapolis and Morrison Knudsen of Idaho, the two other consortium
partners, want to wrap up the 18 months of talks on Mibrag. 'We are anxious
to conclude the negotiations,' an official from Morrison Knudsen said
yesterday. A spokesman for PowerGen refused to comment beyond saying that
the 'negotiations are at an advanced stage'.
Mr Jurgen Stotz, a board member of Veag, said: 'If the Anglo-Americans have
any doubts, it is probably about making a quick return on their investment.
But in the energy sector, you have to look to the long term in terms of
profits.' The alternative buyer for Mibrag was Rheinbraun, the lignite
mining subsidiary of RWE Energie, western Germany's largest utility.
The federal Finance Ministry and the Treuhand are anxious to open up the
energy sector to outside competition, despite strong pressure from RWE and
the other west German utilities. RWE argues that Mibrag should be combined
with the Laubag, the other lignite fields, if the two are to be economic.
PowerGen has good personal relations at the highest level with RWE. Mr Ed
Wallace, its chairman, is a member of RWE's international advisory board.

THE Lebanese government has awarded a L100bn (Pounds 41m) contract to
Ansaldo, the Italian state-controlled engineering group, to repair the
country's power stations, writes Robert Graham from Rome.
The contract is seen as an important signal of the Lebanese government's
resolve to revive the country's war-torn economy. Lebanon has three hydro-
and three oil-fuelled power stations.
The project is expected to last 18 months, and when complete Lebanon will
have an installed capacity of 1,100 MW. Work on the first two powers
stations, in the capital Beirut and near Sidon, has already begun. Funding
is coming from Italian government aid funds and Arab aid, especially from
Kuwait.

FT  15 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Gatt poker is turned into blame game -
France's potentially scuppering tactics in Uruguay Round
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WE ARE in a poker game,' Mr Gerard Longuet, France's trade and industry
minister, said of the Uruguay Round of world trade negotiations yesterday.
'Virtually everyone is agreed to finish the card game before the night is
out, but nothing is definitive until the last trick is played.'
This optimistic gloss still portrays the negotiations under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as a game of bluff and counterbluff between
France and its fellow Europeans and the Americans. The deadline for the
round will be respected through the talks somehow ending in agreement during
the night of December 14-15.
In an attempt to sneak a look at each other's hand and perhaps break the
stalemate, Mr Longuet and Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative,
were due to meet in Brussels last night.
But what German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Paris on Wednesday night called
'American inflexibility and French rigidity' looks just as much like genuine
deadlock. Mr Kantor was giving Brussels a flat no to the French-inspired
request for a revision of last year's transatlantic deal on farm trade at
exactly the same time as French prime minister Edouard Balladur was getting
a standing ovation from his massive parliamentary majority for refusing to
accept it.
Regardless of the change in government, the scene in the National Assembly
was the same as a year ago. The prime minister calls for national unity in
defence of French agriculture, he fails to get it only to the degree that
the opposition criticises him for not being tough enough, and the parliament
behaves - in the words of one deputy on Wednesday - 'like a convention of
farmers'.
The big difference this year, though, is the threat of a serious crisis
within the EC if France is seen to be the wrecker of the entire Uruguay
Round. This is why Mr Kohl came to Paris not only to warn France against
protectionism but to offer to mediate between Paris and Washington.
In fact, Mr Balladur is well aware of the European stakes that ride on his
ability to finesse a Gatt accord. His chief Gatt expert is also in charge of
EC policy. In addition, Mr Balladur convenes a weekly meeting of some seven
ministers to decide the government's Gatt tactics. For what France is
playing is a blame game with the US and Cairns group of farm
produce-exporting countries. Each side wants to pin any responsibility for
scuppering the entire Uruguay Round on the other.
This explains Mr Balladur's semi-retreat this week from his ministers'
suggestion for an interim Gatt deal by mid-December, leaving arguments about
agriculture and culture to be settled later. But the idea was refused by the
US, and (more important for France) criticised within the EC because it was
seen to be too naked a way of reviving France's old demand for agriculture
to be kept out of Gatt.
France would love the US to propose an interim Gatt deal, shorn, of course,
of agriculture. Mr Balladur told the National Assembly that France was ready
to accept a partial deal, if 'certain partners were to propose it'. In an
interview yesterday, Mr Longuet spelled out Paris's reasoning why it would
be in US self-interest to take this initiative.
'We understand why the US might not be able to obtain its very important
agreement on a North American Free Trade Agreement, and to reform its health
system at home, while negotiating a full world trade agreement at the same
time,' he said. 'The salami has to be eaten in slices.' The beauty of this
Cartesian logic is clearly, however, not appreciated in Washington.
What would Paris like to see in an interim Gatt accord? 'Some commitment to
reforming Gatt into a proper multilateral trade organisation (MTO), the
progress that has been made on market access (tariff cuts), and some
concession on culture,' suggests Mr Longuet.
How could an MTO be set up before a complete Gatt accord? And how could the
world agree on trade disciplines and sanctions in an MTO before it had
agreed on a new set of trade rules?
'If we can obtain the commitment, the procedure, then we can get agreement
on the substance,' replies Mr Longuet, pointing to the way the EC itself has
evolved.
A growing number of France's politicians and businessmen are, in fact, ready
to list in public the general advantages of a Gatt deal for the world's
fourth biggest exporter. 'We have 6 per cent of world trade, but less than
half that share in south-east Asia,' says Mr Longuet. 'We need, through
Gatt, better access to these fast-growing markets.'
But very few Frenchmen will concede in public that these advantages outweigh
any costs to French farmers. One lone exception is Mr Patrick Devedjian, an
RPR Gaullist deputy, but he had his report in support of free trade killed
in committee this week. Yet, if Mr Devedjian is to gain any converts among
his 576 fellow deputies, Washington will have to concede something on
agriculture.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US PRODUCT liability laws lie behind virtually all the financial troubles
facing the London and Lloyd's insurance markets, one of the UK's leading
insurance lawyers says.
Mr David MacIntosh, senior partner of City solicitors Davies Arnold Cooper,
told the International Bar Association meeting in New Orleans yesterday that
the debris created by the US system was tangible.
Over 400 insurers in the US were subject to insurance company supervisions,
conservatorships, rehabilitations and liquidations. Giant US corporations
such as John Mansville, the asbestos manufacturer, and AH Robins, the
pharmaceutical group, had been forced into Chapter 11 protection and
insurers and reinsurers around the world were 'reeling from red-line
entries'.
But it was possible that over-regulation and over-protectiveness had
backfired on US consumers, making the practice of medicine too defensive,
closing municipal facilities which could not afford to insure, discouraging
production of life-saving vaccines and wiping out insurance companies.
These concerns were echoed by Mr Victor Schwartz, a US product liability
lawyer, who saw a strong case for saying the US system, far from keeping bad
products off the market, merely stopped development of good ones.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Haitian justice minister shot dead

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ASSASSINS yesterday killed Haiti's justice minister and at least two other
people in an escalation of the violence that has set the country's military
leaders on a collision course with the US administration, Reuter reports
from Port-au-Prince.
Justic Minister Guy Malary was shot dead in Port-au-Prince, the capital,
shortly after President Bill Clinton had warned Haitian military leaders to
restore democracy. Mr Malary, a wealthy lawyer, was a supporter of ousted
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who is intended to return to the country
under a United Nations peace accord signed by General Raoul Cedras, the army
chief.
The Haitian government said that Mr Malary's bodyguard and driver were also
killed and local radio said there were unconfirmed reports of a fourth
death. The minister's car was found riddled with bullets beside a church
where another supporter of President Aristide was shot dead last month.
In another show of defiance against international pressure, members of a
pro-military group marched into parliament, briefly held some legislators
hostage and expressed their support for Gen Cedras, local radio reported.
Nearly all cabinet ministers, who were sworn into office last month, have
received death threats from civilian gunmen known as 'attaches' for their
links to police and army. Mr Malary had been spearheading legislation to
separate Haiti's army and police, a crucial step in the UN accord.
Earlier yesterday, police chief Michel Francois, who controls
Port-au-Prince, vowed he would not bend to international pressure and give
up power. 'I'm Haitian and I've chosen to die in my country,' he said.
His supporters said they would paralyse Port-au-Prince with a general strike
on Monday, the day international sanctions imposed by the United Nations
take effect.
Mr Dante Caputo, the chief UN envoy to Haiti, said even the immediate
resignation of Gen Cedras was not enough to call off the UN sanctions. He
said he wanted hard proof that the army would halt growing street violence
before the UN considered cancelling the planned oil embargo and freeze of
Haiti's assets.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS Bank yesterday asked the US Supreme Court to hear its case against
California's unitary taxation system despite efforts by the state to stave
off a fight. The court is expected to decide next month whether to hear the
case.
California last week changed its tax code to address many of the bank's
concerns, but the bank says this does not go far enough. Barclays argues
that the state cannot be allowed to keep taxes it had collected
unconstitutionally since 1977.
At stake is approximately Dollars 533m (Pounds 353m) California would owe
Barclays and other foreign-owned companies if the court ruled for the bank.
The state could owe as much as Dollars 3.1bn if the Supreme Court extended a
ruling against unitary taxation to US-owned companies.
Under the unitary taxation method, California assessed taxes on a proportion
of companies' world-wide income rather than on income earned in the state.
After the law was amended, the US solicitor general asked the court not to
hear Barclays' case, as the bank's complaints had now been met.
The administration finds itself caught between a campaign promise made by
President Bill Clinton to back California, and pressure from US businesses
and foreign governments to uphold norms of international taxation.

<TEXT>
ARGENTINE President Carlos Menem underwent emergency heart surgery
yesterday. Mr Menem's doctor said the operation was to clear a blockage of
the carotid artery which feeds blood to the head.
Mr Menem, 63, was on his way to the airport for a flight to Chile, where he
was to attend a summit of Latin American leaders, when his motorcade was
diverted to a clinic specialising in heart disease, local radio said.
Markets reacted to the news of the surgery with sharp falls in Argentine
securities overseas. Local markets closed minutes after the announcement
that he would undergo heat surgery. In New York, YPF, the privatised oil
company, fell 4 per cent on the news.
Doctors in Buenos Aires say Mr Menem's illness is serious but believe it was
probably caught early before it could lead to complications. However, one
doctor estimated that the president might require two months' rest. This
would be a severe setback for his attempts to change the constitution and
stand for re-election.
Argentina's Congress is to begin impeachment proceedings against the Supreme
Court a week after Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, publicly accused
two of the nine-member justices of theft and corruption.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Clinton airs fears on UN operations: President cautious
about American role in peacekeeping forces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton asserted yesterday that US experience in Somalia had
made him 'more cautious' about dispatching American troops to participate in
United Nations peacekeeping operations, including any in Bosnia.
He told a press conference that it would be vital to avoid 'any ambiguity
about what the range of decisions were which could be made by a command
other than an American command with direct accountability to the US here'.
This is why, he said, 'I've made clear all along that any Bosnian operation
would have to be operated through Nato', which had an American general as
Supreme Allied Commander in Europe who 'talks every day to the chairman of
the joint chiefs of staff and works in very clear co-operation with the
other Nato forces.'
Mr Clinton did not think the experience in Haiti, where US troops were
prevented from landing this week, was relevant to the broader question of
peacekeeping. This was because the planned 'lightly armed' US and Canadian
mission there was not intended either to keep the peace or make it.
The president continued to issue tough warnings to the military regime in
Haiti, implying that the US might employ a naval blockade to enforce renewed
UN sanctions. He was unable to use the word blockade, he said, because 'in
international law it is associated with an act of war'.
Speaking a few hours before reports of the assassination in Port-au-Prince
of Haiti's Justice Minister Guy Malary, Mr Clinton said he was particularly
concerned about the safety of Mr Robert Malval, the civilian prime minister,
whom he called 'a stabilising figure'. It would be 'a grave error', he said,
'to underestimate the extent to which this country regards him as an
important part of the ultimate solution.'
He also dismissed reservations in the US about the democratic credentials of
Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the ousted president, noting he had offered an
explicit amnesty to Haiti's military and police leaders, who forced him into
exile two years ago. 'All I know is that in our dealings with him he has
done what he said he would do.'
Mr Clinton was at his most loquacious not merely in defending his own
foreign policy record but also in emphasising his belief that UN
peacekeeping had an important role in the world, with US contributions under
the right terms.
He particularly commended the UN record in Cambodia, in which he observed
there were no US peacekeepers, as the sort of model that might be applied to
Somalia and elsewhere. The UN, he said, 'worked through the politics of
Cambodia by creating a process in which the local people had to take
responsibility for their own future.' He added that Bosnia was 'a whole
different issue' at present.
But the US on its own, though now the only superpower, was no more able to
resolve long political disputes than it was 20 and 30 years ago, an apparent
reference to US involvement in Vietnam.
Reorganisation of the UN peacekeeping apparatus, whether or not it included
US forces serving under US command, was vital, he said.
Mr Clinton's insistence on retaining a clear US chain of military command
conforms very much with domestic political wishes. However, he said US
losses in the bloody firefight in Mogadishu early this month could not be
ascribed to the fact that the overall UN commander in Somalia was a Turkish
general.
Senate leaders have agreed on a Somalia amendment that would support Mr
Clinton's March 31 withdrawal date, Republican senators said yesterday. But
even so, as Mr Clinton implicitly conceded, the prospects of the US
contributing to any Bosnian peacekeeping operation, under virtually any
terms of engagement, are currently next to nil.

LATIN AMERICAN presidents will again press for a swift conclusion to
international trade negotiations and for a commitment to open access to
markets when they meet today in Santiago, the Chilean capital.
The Uruguay Round is one of the main topics for debate at the annual Rio
Group summit, which will host presidents from 11 Latin American states, plus
a representative each from Central America and the Caribbean, this year El
Salvador and Jamaica.
Latin American countries, many of which have undergone radical economic
liberalisation since the mid-1980s, feel they have received scant reward.
'We have been liberalising our markets without better access to markets in
the developed world,' said one official.
Mr Alejandro Foxley, Chile's finance minister, put it more tersely. 'We are
very confused and disappointed by the total failure of the Gatt negotiations
and by the sad spectacle of industrialised nations doing their best not to
agree on some obvious matters such as the agricultural issue,' he said. 'It
is a task that has been postponed and swept under the rug for years.'
Other topics likely to be discussed at the summit include the role of
regional trading blocks, the strengthening of the region's often fragile
democracies, and combating chronic poverty, which worsened sharply during
the 1980s.

ARGENTINA'S Congress is to begin impeachment proceedings against the Supreme
Court a week after Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, publicly accused
two of the nine-member justices of theft and corruption.
The impeachment committee of the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of
Congress, voted unanimously on Wednesday to investigate Mr Cavallo's
allegations as a preliminary step to possible impeachment.
The political offensive against the Supreme Court is taking place against
the background of President Carlos Menem's battle to win the backing of
two-thirds of Congress to lift the constitution's ban on successive
presidential terms. Mr Menem wants to continue in office after his six-year
term ends in July 1995.
However, talks yesterday with the opposition Radical party broke down,
making it more likely that Mr Menem will call a plebiscite next month on the
issue. The government has denied charges that the court has become a
bargaining chip in negotiations with the Radicals.
Opposition members of the impeachment committee want all nine justices
impeached for lack of independence from the government. The Peronists only
want to impeach Mr Enrique Petracchi and Mr Augusto Belluscio, the two
justices accused by Mr Cavallo.
He alleges they have benefited directly from Supreme Court rulings, notably
those in which the state was ordered to pay large fees to lawyers acting on
its behalf. He says fees due to lawyers in pending cases could exceed
Dollars 4bn.
Both judges - who last month said pro-government Supreme Court colleagues
had 'stolen' a ruling against the central bank and tried to replace it with
a favourable one - have issued writs against Mr Cavallo, accusing him of
slander, a crime which carries jail terms of six months to three years.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE yield on the 30-year benchmark US Treasury bond fell to a 16-year low of
5.85 per cent yesterday following reassuring news on inflation.
The Labour Department said producer prices rose 0.2 per cent last month and
only 0.5 per cent in the year to September. Excluding the volatile food and
energy elements, the 'core' producer price index was flat last month.
Analysts had expected an increase in core producer prices of as much as 0.3
per cent.
The figures indicate the modest pace of economic growth is keeping
inflationary pressures well in check.
Separate data yesterday on retail sales were also encouraging. The overall
increase last month was 0.1 per cent, but the gain in the year to September
was 6.1 per cent. The figures are not adjusted for inflation.
Sluggish 'headline' sales last month reflected a sharp drop in car sales
after strong earlier gains. Excluding cars, sales were up 0.6 per cent.
Sales of furniture and clothing rose 1.9 per cent and 2.1 per cent
respectively last month.
Officials also revised up estimates of retail sales in July and August.
Overall, the figures suggest real consumer spending grew at an annual rate
of 4 per cent or more in the third quarter.
'The economy is looking very good indeed,' said Mr Bruce Steinberg, a senior
economist at Merrill Lynch, the financial services group. The underlying
rate of economic growth was about 3 per cent and there was a 'complete
absence of inflation pressure.'
However, he warned that fluctuations in corporate inventories, partly
reflecting the impact of flooding in the Midwest, would distort growth
figures in the second half. Figures for third-quarter growth to be published
next week were likely to show expansion at an annual rate of 2 per cent. But
fourth-quarter growth was likely to be above the trend at about 4 per cent.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Reinsurers reeling from red-line entries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
US PRODUCT liability laws lie behind virtually all the financial troubles at
present faced by the London and Lloyd's insurance markets, one of the UK's
leading insurance lawyers says.
Mr David MacIntosh, senior partner of City solicitors Davies Arnold Cooper,
told the International Bar Association meeting in New Orleans yesterday that
the debris created by the US system was tangible.
Over 400 insurers in the US were subject to insurance company supervisions,
conservatorships, rehabilitations and liquidations. Giant US corporations
such as John Mansville, the asbestos manufacturer, and AH Robins, the
pharmaceutical group, had been forced into Chapter 11 protection and
insurers and reinsurers around the world were 'reeling from red-line
entries'.
Too often, the goalposts of liability had been moved to the disadvantage of
the insurance industry long after the risk was rated and the premium, now
seen to be inadequate, had been paid.
But it was possible that over-regulation and over-protectiveness had
backfired on US consumers, making the practice of medicine too defensive,
closing municipal facilities which could not afford to insure, discouraging
production of life-saving vaccines and wiping out so many insurance
companies and Lloyd's names.
These concerns were echoed by Mr Victor Schwartz, a leading US product
liability lawyer. A strong case existed for saying the US system, far from
keeping bad products off the market, merely stopped development of good
ones.
Attempts to pass federal legislation to curb excessive awards of punitive
damages and rationalise the system had been bogged down in Congress for 12
years, he said.
The all-powerful plaintiffs' bar had blocked reform during the Republican
years. Whereas former President George Bush and his vice-president Dan
Quayle were too closely aligned to business for reform to pass, signs were
that under the Clinton administration, Congress was moving closer to acting
on the issue.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Canada's politics to take on a provincial hue: The rise of
unashamedly regionalist parties in run-up to election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE opinion polls are correct, the green benches of Canada's House of
Commons will be packed with a new breed of MP after the general election on
October 25.
As many as a third of the 295 members will not only be newcomers, but will
owe their allegiance to two new parties whose policies risk tearing their
country apart.
Canadian politics has been dominated until now by three national parties -
the Liberals, Progressive Conservatives and New Democrats - which have
sought to balance the interests of disparate regions of the world's
second-biggest country. The newcomers' loyalties however, will be to the
Bloc Quebecois and the Reform party, two unashamedly regional groups.
The Bloc Quebecois seems set, according to the polls, to win at least 35
seats, and perhaps as many as 60. Its ultimate aim is independence for the
francophone province. In the meantime, it promises to measure every
initiative coming out of Ottawa against the interests of Quebec alone.
The Reform party, whose support is concentrated on the prairies and British
Columbia, could win 50 seats or more. The typical Reform supporter opposes
official bilingualism, scorns the civil servants in faraway Ottawa and
complains that Quebec gets more than its fair share of the Canadian pie.
Reform says that it favours keeping Canada in one piece. But its terms for
reshaping the federation are unacceptable to most Quebecois. Mr Ken Norrie,
an economics professor at the University of Alberta, says that the party's
leader, Mr Preston Manning, 'is making a lot of the fact that Reform are the
ones to stand up to Quebec'.
Of the old national parties, only the Liberals can look forward to
significant representation in the new parliament. It is uncertain, however,
whether they will win enough seats to form a majority government. A clear
majority of Liberal MPs are also likely to be from a single province,
Ontario.
The Conservatives, who have held office for the past nine years, have had a
disastrous campaign under their inexperienced leader, Ms Kim Campbell. They
will be lucky to form the official opposition. The left-leaning NDP, which
has 43 seats, faces near-annihilation, hit by unpopular policies pursued by
regional NDP governments.
In addition, its strident opposition to free trade with the US has failed to
capture voters' imaginations.
Although the Liberals will almost certainly have the satisfaction of forming
the next government, they face a challenge of a kind which has never before
confronted a Canadian government.
'Every issue henceforth will be defined in regional terms,' says Mr Donald
Savois, a professor of politics at the University of Moncton in New
Brunswick. 'That's nothing new, but in the past it was done in caucus and
around the cabinet table. Now we'll see it on the floor of the House of
Commons.'
Canada's make-up is already a recipe for regional jealousies and mistrust.
Living in a country which spans 4 1/2 time zones, the typical Newfoundlander
or Quebecois feels more at home on the beaches of Florida than in Toronto or
Vancouver. Some Nova Scotians still speak Gaelic and on the Pacific coast
the dominant foreign influence is Chinese as a result of a huge influx of
immigrants and capital from Hong Kong.
The economic interests of different parts of the country are often poles
apart. Alberta is a big oil and gas producer. But Ontario and Quebec, the
most industrialised provinces, are energy consumers. Wheat farmers in
Saskatchewan and Manitoba want to break down foreign trade barriers, while
dairy farmers in Quebec want to maintain protection from imports.
The country is also sharply divided between the four 'rich' provinces
(Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta), and the less well-off ones.
The Atlantic provinces, in particular, rely heavily on transfer payments
from Ottawa. Unemployment insurance and welfare are virtually the only
income at present for thousands of fishermen in Newfoundland and Nova
Scotia, whose industry has been devastated by the near-collapse of North
Atlantic cod stocks.
A panoply of laws and customs, not to mention Canadians' famed ability to
compromise, has so far held these tensions in check.
A federal law, for instance, requires provinces to maintain minimum
standards of health care without imposing user fees. Government contracts
and patronage appointments are carefully balanced to avoid any appearance of
favouritism.
The BQ and the Reform Party are already questioning many of these practices.
Both favour a greater devolution of powers from Ottawa to the provinces.
There is no shortage of regional issues waiting to explode after the
election. One of the earliest could be the politically charged struggle for
survival between the two biggest airlines - Air Canada, which is based in
Montreal, and Canadian Airlines International, whose operations are centred
in Calgary and Vancouver.
The present Conservative government has resisted pressure from both camps to
take sides.
The new government, especially if it is a minority one, will also have its
hands full preparing the next federal budget. All the bigger parties have
pledged some degree of fiscal restraint in an effort to contain a spiralling
national debt.
But the sparks could fly when tough decisions have to be made on where the
savings are to be found. Many areas of potential spending cuts, from
military bases to business subsidies and unemployment insurance, have strong
regional overtones.
In the remaining 10 days of the campaign the Liberals and Conservatives are
expected to do everything they can to stop the build-up of support for the
protest parties.
Some observers dismiss the view that a strong performance by the BQ and the
Reform Party necessarily spells the beginning of the end of a united Canada.
The optimists point out that both parties are in large measure a haven for
voters who simply want a change after the tough times of the past few years.
The Bloc Quebecois, in particular, has yet to demonstrate that most
Quebecois favour independence.
Furthermore, many of the two parties' neophyte MPs could be out of their
depth in Ottawa. Some of them have virtually no political experience and,
until a month or two ago, seemed to have little chance of being elected.
Whether the BQ and the Reform party are able to translate their expected
electoral gains into more solid support for their ideologies may depend
greatly on the adroitness of Mr Jean Chretien, the Liberals' leader.
Mr Chretien is a staunch federalist who this year celebrates his 30th
anniversary as an MP. Few would dispute that he faces what Mr Norrie
describes as 'an absolutely hellish job' to contain regional animosities if
and when he becomes prime minister.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Egyptian cabinet reshuffle completed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ATEF SIKDI, Egypt's prime minister, yesterday completed a cabinet
reshuffle, shifting 15 ministers and dropping 11 from the 34-strong
government, but leaving the powerful defence, interior and central economic
portfolios unchanged.
The reshuffle, Egypt's first for two years, follows the former cabinet's
formal resignation on this week's opening of President Hosni Mubarak's third
six-year term as head of state.
The change keeps largely intact the team that has overseen the first stages
of International Monetary Fund and World Bank economic reforms, with Mr Atef
Obeid, cabinet affairs minister, Mr Mohammed al-Razzaz, finance minister,
and Mr Kemal al-Ganzoury, planning minister, all staying put.
Mr Yousef Boutros Ghali will remain a key interlocutor in the IMF and World
Bank negotiations, moving from a ministry of state to that of international
co-operation. However, Mr Mahmoud Mohamed Mahmoud, a banker, replaces Mr
Yousry Moustafa as minister of economy and foreign trade. Mr Fouad Sultan,
tourism minister, is replaced by Mr Mamdouh Beltagui, formerly head of state
information services.
Mr Sidki, who has served as prime minister since 1986, said on Wednesday
that Mr Ismail Hassan, chairman of the Bank of Alexandria, would replace Mr
Mohammed Salheddin Hamid as governor of the central bank. Eleven ministers
are unchanged, including defence, energy, information, interior, foreign
affairs, culture, justice, and petroleum. New portfolios have been created
for population, immigration, and housing, and one for 'follow up' - a post
so far ill-defined.
Independent commentators suggested the changes, though numerous, did not
signal any fundamental deviation from Mr Mubarak's cautious approach to
economic and political reforms. 'The basic characteristic of this is
continuity; they don't want to do anything drastic,' one political analyst
said.

<TEXT>
THE lives of 20m people in Africa are poised 'on a knife edge between life
and death' and many will die without emergency aid, a group of seven leading
British aid agencies warned yesterday.
The London-based Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) which is co-ordinating
an appeal for assistance, said at a press conference yesterday that war in
10 countries 'has left millions of people homeless, struggling to survive in
appalling conditions where sickness and disease are rife. Many people are on
the edge of starvation and in need of urgent help'.
The committee said starvation threatened 2m people in southern Sudan and
1,000 people were dying every day in Angola. Other countries hit by war or
caught in its aftermath are Zaire, Liberia, Mozambique, Ethiopia, Eritrea,
Somalia, Sierra Leone and Rwanda. The agencies represented by the committee
are: Actionaid, The British Red Cross, CAFOD, Christian Aid, Help the Aged,
Oxfam and Save the Children.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Keating to act on Aborigine land rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, is to present draft
legislation to his cabinet on Monday setting out a system for deciding land
claims lodged by Aborigine groups.
The legislation could then be delivered to parliament in a matter of weeks.
In Canberra yesterday, Mr Keating said the proposed legislation would allow
Aborigine groups to choose either federal or state jurisdictions, recognised
by the Commonwealth, for the hearing of native title claims.
Some states had argued that all native title decisions should lie in their
hands. However, Mr Keating added that decisions over the economic use of
native title land would remain exclusively with Commonwealth-approved state
tribunals.
'Existing grants of interest will be validated and be secure, and the states
and territories will continue to have the capacity to manage land if they
meet the standards of the Commonwealth bill,' he said.
Mr Keating indicated that native title could, under the government's
legislation, co-exist with some existing leasehold titles, but he did not
detail which leases would come under this category. Aborigine groups have
been pushing to extend an earlier proposal that mining leases should be the
only significant class of leases not to extinguish native title. They have
been seeking to ensure that native title could sit alongside pastoral,
tourism or forestry leases, and revive once these expired.
The issue of Aborigine land rights has been contentious for the past 18
months. In May 1992, the High Court quashed the notion that Australia had
been unoccupied before European settlement and indicated that native title
could apply where Aborigines had maintained close association with the land.
This prompted an outcry from the mining industry, generated concerns among
international investors and pitted some state governments against the
Commonwealth.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Mitterrand to press Saudis on oil threats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC WATKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SANAA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH President Francois Mitterrand, who generally declines to call himself
a businessman, will have business very much on his mind when he arrives in
Riyadh today for a one-day visit.
With a French trade imbalance of nearly Dollars 1bn favouring Saudi Arabia
in 1992, Mr Mitterrand will be promoting his country's goods, including
Airbus and a wide array of military hardware. And, as one of the Saudis'
chief allies in the Gulf war, Mr Mitterrand can expect an attentive hearing.
Mr Mitterrand, who on Monday visits Yemen, Riyadh's main political rival on
the Arabian peninsula, will wish to discuss with the Saudis their recent
threats to French oil interests in Yemen.
In May 1992 and again in August this year, Saudi Arabia sent letters to
western oil companies in Yemen, including France's Societe Nationale Elf
Aquitaine, warning them against operating along the border between the two
countries, in dispute since 1934.
Though most companies have ignored the warning, and continued their work, BP
and Petro-Canada - citing purely geological reasons - have since
relinquished their licences for exploration in the contested regions.
Mr Mitterrand may also be concerned about a much more recent disruption of
French oil interests in Yemen.
In April Total, the French oil giant, declared a 12,000 b/d find at its
concession in East Shabwa and, on the basis of other finds, may soon declare
it commercially viable. But in early September, Total's drilling camp in
East Shabwa was attacked. A Yemeni guard died and several others were
wounded.
Total has since suspended its operations at the site and there are worries
among Yemenis that the company may withdraw altogether as a result of the
attack. Total officials confirm temporary suspension of their work in East
Shabwa, but deny they have any intention of invoking force majeur to end
their operations in the country.
While many people have blamed local tribes for the attack on Total, western
security experts say the raid was untypical of Yemeni tribesmen.
'It was too well organised,' one security expert said, 'and not at all
characteristic of Yemeni tribal tactics. The camp had been thoroughly
reconnoitred, three armed men entered, knocked out the radio room, disabled
the company's aeroplane, and retreated under covering fire from at least 40
men in the surrounding hills.'
Tribal difficulties of a more typical kind took place in April when
tribesmen kidnapped six Total employees at gunpoint to put pressure on the
company into employing their kinsmen. The hostages were later released
unharmed after Total agreed to provide the tribe with 85 jobs.
Also typical was the experience of the Dallas-based Hunt oil company in July
1992 when tribesmen seized its general manager and six other workers to use
as bargaining chips in a dispute with the Yemeni government. After peaceful
negotiations, all seven were released.
Mr Mitterrand will be concerned to have assurances from Riyadh that French
oil interests in Yemen can proceed without any further Saudi threats or
disturbances.
On Monday Mr Mitterrand will become the first western head of state to visit
Yemen since its parliamentary elections on April 27.
Now seen as a potential model for democratic change in the region and a
threat to the Saudi monarchy, Yemen will be looking for a political seal of
approval from Mr Mitterrand. The degree of his approval, however, may well
depend on the strength of assurances he receives in Riyadh.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Sri Lanka's military stalks Jaffna: Army hopes of an end to
rebel control of the northern peninsula
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD COWPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SRI LANKA'S military top brass, angered by months of political prevarication
and the assassination in May of President Ranasinghe Premadasa, say they now
have the go-ahead to regain the rebel-held northern peninsula of Jaffna.
Of course, no one will say when the main offensive - across the war-torn
area that is also home to about 600,000 Tamil civilianslaunched, but army
commanders hint that it is likely to be in the new year.
The over-stretched Sri Lankan army, well below strength from casualties and
injuries in a war that has claimed 32,000 lives since 1983, has been rapidly
rebuilding. Some 10,000 new recruits are in training to join the 80,000
already under arms. The target is 100,000.
The military plans to purchase helicopter gunships, landing craft and fast
patrol boats in preparation for the big push.
A number of preparatory tactical thrusts may already have begun. Earlier
this month 4,000 soldiers, backed by tanks, fighter jets and gunboats,
launched an operation to destroy the Tamil Tiger (LTTE) rebels' main port on
the Jaffna lagoon which is used to bypass the army land blockade.
Setting off from their strategic army base at Elephant Pass - which seals
off the largely guerrilla-held Jaffna Peninsula from the mainland  - the
government troops thrust north. But on the second day they were caught by
surprise in a murderous crossfire from 1,000 well-dug-in Tamil Tigers.
In a pitched battle, involving dozens of women and some of the fiercest
hand-to-hand fighting of the war, the army lost 118 men and killed at least
150 guerrillas. The soldiers held their ground and went on to destroy the
port of Kilaly before returning to base.
Senior commanders are optimistic they will be ready to take Jaffna soon  -
after all, they say, it is a comparatively tiny piece of land just 50 miles
long and 20 miles wide.
Others believe this is wishful thinking. The Sri Lankan armed forces lost
their most experienced commanders in a land mine explosion more than a year
ago and, it is argued, is no match for the fanatical and tightly organised
Tamil Tigers.
The guerrillas, whose well armed and trained members in the north may amount
to just a few thousand, were able to defeat 120,000 Indian troops in the
late 1980s.
They are so single-minded that every combatant carries a cyanide pill around
the neck, which they swallow rather than allow themselves to be taken alive.
The group is led by Velupillai Prabhakaran, an autocrat, one of the world's
most wanted terrorists and a brilliant military strategist who commands
almost religious obedience from his fighters.
Mr S T Hondaman, Sri Lanka's most famous Tamil and a minister in every
cabinet since 1978, is not convinced that the army will go in. 'They have
been saying they will take Jaffna for years. In the latest offensive, what
happened? They withdrew,' he says.
Many in the government, however, say the impossibility of negotiating with
Mr Prabhakaran has at last persuaded the cabinet it has no alternative but
to go all-out for the military option.
The final straw is said to have come in May when a Tamil suicide bomber with
explosive strapped round his waist, assassinated President Premadasa at a
political rally in Colombo.
His successor, President DB Wijetunge, has publicly vowed to crush
terrorism.
'There is no ethnic problem in the north, only terrorism,' he says.
Success over the past 12 months in reducing terrorist control in the
country's Eastern province could free thousands of Sri Lankan troops for
operations in the north.
In addition there is some evidence of growing Tamil resentment of the LTTE's
iron grip on the lives and pockets of inhabitants in the Jaffna Peninsula.
These have added to Colombo's belief that the time is right for military
action. The fallout, should the army defeat the guerrillas and regain
control of the peninsula in a relatively short period, is unclear. The
biggest fear is that the price which may have to be paid in terms of loss of
life, foreign investor confidence and international opprobrium may be more
than the country can bear.
Says one International Red Cross official who regularly goes to Jaffna: 'If
the army besieges the city of Jaffna with its half-million citizens and
leaves the Tigers no escape route it will be murderous hand-to-hand fighting
with civilians caught in the middle. Many thousands of non-combatants will
die. The best we can hope for is that the population will be able to go to
designated safe areas and that the LTTE will be allowed to retreat southward
into the jungle.'

Opposition leaders in Malawi yesterday gave qualified approval to the
appointment of a three-man presidential council to take executive authority,
Nick Young reports from Lilongwe. The appointment appears to mark the
effective end of the rule of President Hastings Banda, who is in South
Africa recovering from a brain operation.
Mr Gwanda Chakuamba, made secretary-general of the ruling Malawi Congress
party last week, heads the council; the other two are ministers Mr John
Tembo and Mr Robson Chirwa.

ISRAELI and Palestinian peacemakers hammered out a comprehensive agenda on
security and civilian issues to implement a framework peace agreement
yesterday and set up a sub-committee to decide the fate of up to 11,500
Israeli-held Palestinian prisoners, Julian Ozanne reports from Taba.
On the second day of talks at the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba, the
Palestinian delegation, led by Mr Nabil Shaath, pressed the Israelis for the
quick release of Palestinian prisoners. The Israelis agreed to establish a
sub-committee to deliberate on prisoners, deportees and fugitives.
Both sides agreed an agenda for the talks, which resume in Taba next
Wednesday, but refused to make it public. Among the items known to be on the
agenda are the smooth transfer of power from the Israeli military
administration in the occupied territories to a Palestinian authority; the
territorial delimiting of the Jericho area which Israeli troops will quit;
and the timetable for Israeli military withdrawal from Jericho and Gaza.

   MOGADISHU, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOMALIA'S rebel warlord, Gen Mohamed Farah Aideed, yesterday freed a US
helicopter pilot and a Nigerian soldier after four days of intense
negotiations spearheaded by Mr Robert Oakley, the US special envoy in
Mogadishu.
Warrant Officer Michael Durant, shot down 11 days ago in a fierce battle
against Gen Aideed's militias, was carried out on a stretcher from the back
alleys of south Mogadishu and handed over to officials of the International
Committee of the Red Cross. The Nigerian peacekeeper, Trooper Umar Shantali,
had been captured on September 5 during an ambush in which seven of his
compatriots died.
Their release ended a hostage crisis for the US and also appeared to secure
a central role for Gen Aideed, the most hunted man in Somalia, in defining
the future of his war-shattered and clan-divided country.
In Washington, President Bill Clinton said no deals had been struck to
secure Warrant Officer Durant's release. He said his warning last week of
the consequences of harm being done to the helicopter pilot 'sent a strong
message that was obviously heard'.
He described the release as one of a series of 'hopeful actions' that
demonstrated that US policy in Somalia was 'moving in the right direction'.
A few hours earlier, Gen Aideed emerged from four months in hiding to
announce the imminent release of his 'prisoners of war'.
In exchange, he expected the immediate and unconditional release of his men.
About 50 members of Gen Aideed's National Somali Alliance are thought to be
held by the UN.
Gen Aideed, who is wanted for the murder and mutilation of 24 Pakistani
peacekeepers in June, said he would remain in hiding until the UN and US had
sorted out their contradictory statements about his safety. He said he
wanted an 'independent inquiry' into 'all the crimes committed since June'.
He claimed that 9,000 Somalis had been killed or wounded since the UN
launched retaliatory attacks four months ago. The general appeared confident
that his demands would be granted.
He promised to uphold his unilateral ceasefire, and clearly expected to form
part of fresh political talks on Somalia's future.
'I want a pivotal role in the peace process,' he told reporters at a safe
house in the labyrinth of the Bakara Market district of his south Mogadishu
fiefdom.
The UN will find Gen Aideed's demands unpalatable. The UN Operation in
Somalia (Unosom) has lost 70 peacekeepers and fought itself into a military
quagmire in Mogadishu in a fruitless attempt to bring Gen Aideed to justice.
It was not immediately clear how the UN intended to accommodate all of the
defiant warlord's demands without undertaking humiliating policy reversals.
On the tricky question of whether Gen Aideed should be apprehended for the
murder of the 24 Pakistani peacekeepers Mr Clinton noted, in an apparent
conciliatory gesture, that Gen Aideed had written to former President Jimmy
Carter proposing an independent commission of investigation.
He did not exclude the possibility that the Aideed faction would be part of
the political solution necessary in Somalia.
He said the US had been wrong to wage a highly personalised battle which
undermined the political process.
In Cairo, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, and leaders of
the Organisation of African Unity, the Arab League and the Organisation of
Islamic Conference issued a joint appeal to Arab and African countries to
send military and financial support to the 29,000-strong UN peacekeeping
force in Somalia.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIPPINES police have arrested a leader of a group pursuing claims on
sizeable cash prizes in a Pepsi-Cola numbers game promotion that the
soft-drinks company has refused to pay.
Mr Ferdinand Eslabon, president of the so-called 'United 349', was arrested
by National Bureau of Investigation agents on suspicion of involvement in a
series of bombing attacks on local Pepsi plants and retail outlets five
months ago.
In February last year, Pepsi-Cola Products Philippines, the local bottler of
Pepsi soft drinks, launched 'Number Fever', a sales promotion that promised
cash prizes of up to Pesos 1m to holders of Pepsi bottle caps bearing
three-digit numbers that are declared winners on certain days.
The campaign was to have run until May 8 1992, but was extended by another
four weeks, because, Pepsi officials said, of its tremendous success in
boosting sales. Company officials said Pepsi's market share rose by five
percentage points to 25 per cent during the period.
During the extension, however, the winning number 349 was announced on May
22 1992. That turned the huge marketing success into a nightmare as hundreds
of individuals turned up at Pepsi plants claiming prizes for their '349'
bottle crowns.
Pepsi refused to redeem most of these caps, saying that only those with the
winning number 349 and 'authenticated security codes' printed in the cap
would be paid. About 600,000 caps with the number 349, according to the
company, were distributed as a result of 'a computer glitch'.
Outraged holders of '349' crowns soon massed at Pepsi plants nationwide, in
some cases disrupting deliveries, and leading to the birth of a number of
organisations among the '349' holders, including 'United 349', some of which
pursued claims in court. Of more than 10,000 court cases filed against
Pepsi, 7,400 have been dismissed.
Pepsi officials also note that 18 crowns with the '349' and the
authenticated security code have actually been awarded prizes of varying
sums indicated in the crown.
Also, the company offered Pesos 500 as a 'goodwill gesture' to holders of
non-winning '349' caps. Some 500,000 individuals are reported to have been
paid about Dollars 9m (Pounds 5.9m) under that offer. No negotiations are
being conducted by Pepsi's parent company in New York.

OPPOSITION leaders in Malawi yesterday gave qualified approval to the
appointment of a three-man presidential council to take executive authority.
The appointment appears to mark the effective end of the rule of President
Hastings Banda, who is in South Africa recovering from a brain operation
carried out 10 days ago.
Mr Gwanda Chakuamba, appointed secretary-general of the ruling Malawi
Congress party only last week, heads the council, whose other two members
are Mr John Tembo and Mr Robson Chirwa, both cabinet ministers.
Spokesmen for opposition parties represented on a National Consultative
Council (NCC), negotiating an election timetable and procedure with the
government, have supported the decision to form a presidential council as a
necessary interim measure.
But they claim that the NCC has an agreement with the government according
to which the presidential council will reconvene parliament within seven
days, and amend the constitution to allow a neutral, caretaker president,
with limited powers, to hold office until elections in May.
Hospital reports say Dr Banda's progress is satisfactory.

Mr Justice CF 'Frikkie' Eloff found Mr Derby-Lewis's wife Gaye not guilty on

Richard Goldstone, who heads an investigation into political violence, Mr
Ken Owen, editor of the Sunday Times, and Mr Pik Botha, the foreign

A large crowd gathered outside the court dancing, waving placards and
chanting the controversial slogan 'Kill the Boer, Kill the farmer'.
The death of Mr Hani - found by an opinion poll earlier this year to be the
most popular South African after Mr Mandela - brought the country to a
virtual standstill for 10 days as politicians and police struggled to
control the anger of his supporters.

<TEXT>
BRITISH engineers are preparing to begin repairs to a key bridge in Bosnia
to open up relief routes before winter in what the United Nations has
described as its biggest and most dangerous humanitarian operation to date.
The team of engineers will spend six weeks repairing the bridge over the
River Neretva, which at one point runs through the city of Mostar. Moslem
and Croat forces are locked in a battle for control of the region's
strategic river valley.
Repairs to the bridge would reopen an important lifeline into central
Bosnia.
Colonel Bill Aikman, spokesman for the UN peacekeeping force, said once the
area around the bridge was secured 'we are going to defend it'. He said he
would not preclude the calling in of air strikes if his team were attacked.
The UN's Spanish battalion today will start to advance on the valley,
accompanied by engineers, to secure the bridge, partially destroyed by
Bosnian Croat forces in May.
Despite threats and numerous violations, Nato fighter aircraft policing a
ban on flights over Bosnia, in force since last October, have never launched
a single air strike. General Ratko Mladic, Bosnian Serb military commander,
has brazenly flouted the no-fly zone.
While leaders of all three ethnic communities on July 30 agreed to allow the
free passage of aid convoys, Serb and Croat forces have repeatedly blocked
the delivery of aid to besieged Moslem enclaves.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Russia's breadwinners and losers: The needy are replacing
grain producers in the pecking order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA today enters a brave new world of freed bread prices in a reform that
switches subsidies from inefficient grain producers to impoverished
consumers.
A likely tripling in prices will be softened with a monthly bread subsidy of
Rbs1,400 for about 60m people - almost a third of Russia's population. The
subsidy is enough to buy at least four loaves a month at prices expected to
jump from Rbs100 to about Rbs300-400.
Natalya is an office manager on a monthly salary of Rbs50,000. 'The new
price will be a noose around our neck,' she complained, pausing in front of
the bread shelves at a Moscow grocery store yesterday. Tamara, a
house-painter earning three times as much, shrugged cheerfully. 'We'll
continue eating bread whatever happens. Otherwise we'll stop existing.'
Today's price reform is 'not an experiment', says Mr Yevgeny Tiurin,
vice-president of Roskhlebprodukt, the state grain purchasing agency. 'It is
the introduction of a normal system.'
Roskhlebprodukt is responsible for delivering grain from the state farms to
big cities, the army, and regions which do not produce their own grain.
Until now one of its main functions has been to 'squeeze' the Finance
Ministry for subsidies to make up the difference between the price at which
farms sell grain and the artificially low price charged to flour-mills and
bread-baking enterprises. These have been respectively Rbs80,000 and
Rbs24,000 per tonne of grain.
Ms Liudmila Vronina, the official at the Social Welfare Ministry responsible
for the new system, says the subsidies to help the poorest members of
society to buy bread at free prices are already up and running in many parts
of the country, including Moscow. The monthly subsidy will be automatically
added to all pensions, and is also being given to all unemployed, invalids,
army officers' wives (as part of the Yeltsin government's policy to keep the
army on side), students, and children, regardless of their background.
Working Russians earning less than Rbs14,620 - the minimum pension level, as
the authorities have no other means of measuring the minium subsistence
level - will also qualify.
For the government's hard-pressed budget, it should mean a big reduction -
up to two thirds - in bread-related subsidies and, Mr Boris Fyodorov, the
finance minister, hopes, a reduction of wasted funds and inefficiency. The
total savings on the bread subsidy reform, had it been in effect from the
beginning of the year, could have been as high as Rbs700bn at current
prices. The expected budget deficit this year is Rbs20trillion.
In another reform move, the government plans to do away with a make-believe
credit system for collective and state-owned farming - whereby money is
printed by the central bank but never repaid by borrowers. The government
intends to switch to straight subsidies to finance fuel and other farm
inputs.
Mr Fyodorov says that credits for agriculture and Russia's remote northern
regions, which buy all their food produce ahead of the winter, when
transport becomes virtually impossible, account for two-thirds of subsidised
central bank credits. Politically, these moves will anger the old
co-operatives and state-owned farming lobby which has depended heavily on
guaranteed grain prices for surviving without genuine economic reforms.
But the government says it has nothing to lose from a section of the
population which will vote against its policies whatever it does.
The reform is also expected to make it profitable for bakeries to sell
bread. To prevent them from selling clothes, drinks and cigarettes at
profitable prices instead of unprofitable bread, the government has told
them they must continue selling bread for three years after privatisation.
Most shops in Moscow and many other parts of the country have already been
privatised.

'Free pricing is not only good for normal products and services, it is also
good for products and services in health care,' Mr Bangemann said at a

Pricing should be separated from the question of social security
reimbursements, he said, and low-income citizens should be protected through
other arrangements.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Kurdish violence forces Mobil to halt its operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOBIL Oil of the US has suspended operations in Turkey's south-east region
after a series of violent attacks and attempts at extortion by the rebel
Kurdish Workers' party (PKK).
The decision, which follows the kidnapping in August of seven local staff,
underlines the growing instability in the Kurdish-speaking area, where the
PKK is fighting a violent campaign for independence. The men were
subsequently released.
Mobil said it was no longer prepared to put its employees at risk and would
not meet the extortion demands by the PKK.
The latest incident, on a rig near the refinery town of Batman, followed
four earlier attacks. In one incident, three Mobil engineers were singled
out and shot by rebels of the PKK. 'It is clear that it is Mobil the company
that is now under active threat,' said Mr Roy Johnson, Mobil's production
manager for Turkey.
Turkey's domestic production, although still small, accounts for around 20
per cent of its crude needs, according to industry sources.
The Kurdish region is by the far the most important production region, with
TPAO, the state oil exploration company, producing around 56,000 barrels a
day. The other main producer, with around 14,000 b/d, is Shell, the UK-Dutch
oil major. Company officials say Shell's rig near Batman has been attacked
twice in the last year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY'S prime minister, Mrs Tansu Ciller, yesterday arrived in the United
States in need of a foreign policy boost to her flagging fortunes at home.
More than her predecessor President Suleyman Demirel, Mrs Ciller has
stressed the economic aspects of Turkey's foreign relations. In talks with
President Bill Clinton today, Mrs Ciller will be urging US support for an
exceptional lifting of United Nations sanctions against Iraq to allow the
oil pipeline that runs through Turkey to re-open.
Turkey is seeking compensation for the loss of toll tariffs, estimated at
Dollars 20m (Pounds 13.2m) a month, from the closure of the pipeline.
Western diplomats in Ankara, however, warn that the administration is
unlikely to change its position.
Also on the agenda will be the deteriorating situation in Somalia, where
Turkey provides the commander of the United Nations peacekeeping force and
contributes 300 troops to the operation. Turkey is understood to be hesitant
to commit more soldiers as requested by Mr Frank Wisner, US defence
under-secretary, during a visit to Ankara.
More broadly, Mrs Ciller, who is often portrayed at home with a 'made in
America' tag, will be looking to the US for support for her economic
reforms, a more explicit denouncement of Kurdish separatist violence and a
measured endorsement of Turkey's importance to US strategic interests in the
region. The Clinton administration is said to support a greater Turkish role
in the Middle East. From Washington, Turkey is increasingly seen as playing
a dual role of containment of Iranian fundamentalism, and of President
Saddam Hussein in Baghdad.
Already, Turkey has shifted its policy on Iraq. It continues to provide
bases for allied aircraft to police the no-fly zone in northern Iraq, where
Iraqi Kurds have established a de facto state since the end of the Gulf war.
But Turkey is also improving strained ties with Iraq and is the only member
of the allied coalition to have reopened its Baghdad embassy.
With the US keen to upgrade its security ties with Turkey, Mrs Ciller may
receive a more sympathetic hearing to her request for more flexible terms on
Turkey's military equipment purchases. Turkey is the largest recipient of US
military assistance after Israel and Egypt. Last year it amounted to about
Dollars 500m.
Mrs Ciller faces a testing visit. More than previous Turkish leaders, she
seems vulnerable to the charge of US patronage. A former lecturer at the
University of Connecticut in the 1980s, she was even alleged by her
opponents to have had considered taking US citizenship - a charge she
strongly denied when entering office in June as the new leader of the
centre-right True Path party.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Sweden urged to stimulate its economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN is suffering a depression that has been underestimated by the
right-centre government of Prime Minister Carl Bildt and urgent measures are
needed to stimulate economic growth, Sweden's main trade union organisation
said yesterday.
'People still believe this is a business cycle downturn, but you don't lose
10 per cent of the nation's productive sector in a downturn. We have 14 per
cent of the labour force unemployed. You have to go back to the 1930s to
find such figures,' said Mr Dan Andersson, an economist at LO, the
confederation of blue-collar unions.
The LO said in its latest report on the economy it expected a 3 per cent
decline in gross national product this year, the third consecutive year of
negative growth.
It said 500,000 people had lost their jobs since 1990 and employment was at
it lowest level for 20 years. 'Depression in the Swedish economy is now a
fact,' the report said.
LO figures concur with government estimates showing the decline in GNP and
industrial production ended in the middle of this year, leading to official
forecasts of a return to modest growth in 1994.
It acknowledged the yawning gap in the public finances - the budget deficit
is set to rise to 15 per cent of GNP next year - cramped room for manoeuvre.
But it insisted real recovery would not occur without a government-led
stimulus to break a pattern of high savings and encourage consumption and
investment instead.
The LO called for a further lowering of interest rates and a radical cut in
the 25 per cent standard rate of value added tax. It also said the
government should foster public confidence in the economy by bolstering
welfare services threatened with cuts, such as state pensions.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EURODISNEYLAND, the troubled theme park, plans to cut the prices at some of
its hotels to try to drum up business during the slack winter season, writes
Alice Rawsthorn in Paris.
A family of four will from early January be able to stay in a room at the
Santa Fe, the cheapest of the six hotels at the park, for FFr300 (Pounds
34.80) a night, rather than FFr375.
EuroDisneyland has also made slight cuts in low-season prices at its
middle-range hotels. Room rates at the New York and the Disneyland, the two
most expensive hotels, have remained unchanged at FFr1,000 and FFr1,600
respectively. The price cuts are the latest attempt by EuroDisneyland to
improve its performance. Euro Disney, the park's operating company, which
hoped to be profitable from its first year, is next month expected to
announce heavy losses for the year to September 30. Analysts are braced for
a net deficit of FFr1.8bn for 1992/93.
The group had previously announced it was reducing the low-season entrance
price at the park from FFr250 (at high season) to FFr175 for an adult and
from FFr175 to FFr125 for children.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Bank of Spain cuts interest rate to 9.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of Spain yesterday cut its benchmark interest rate half a
percentage point to 9.5 per cent, the lowest since 1978, following the
success of efforts on Wednesday by the minority socialist government of
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez to secure safe passage for its tight 1994
budget.
Finance ministry officials said the Bank of Spain's move, quickly followed
by base rate cuts by Spain's big commercial banks, also reflected
satisfaction with inflation figures for September and a promise on Wednesday
by trade unions to continue negotiating a three-year wage moderation pact
with the government.
The government and its main partner in parliament, the ruling Catalan CiU,
announced they had reached agreement over the budget which would allow the
Catalans to vote in favour of its passage.
A small grouping of independent Canary Island MPs also said they would vote
for the budget and its success is now all but assured. That, in turn,
virtually ensures the survival of the government for the next year.
The Catalans had threatened not to support the budget, which cuts
non-interest spending and imposes, for the first time, taxes on unemployment
benefits, largely in an effort to force the central government to speed the
transfer of political and fiscal powers to Catalonia.
The socialists, nevertheless, appear to have come away from this clash the
winners. They have only had to fulfil an old promise to allow Catalonia and
other regions to spend 15 per cent of the income taxes raised by the central
government in their territories.
Subsequent negotiations and suggestionsthat they might fail allowed the
Catalans to claim that they had, in fact, wrestled away hard-won
concessions.
The CiU is unlikely in the foreseeable future to want to see the collapse of
the government of Mr Gonzalez.
Political observers in Madrid suggest that while the socialists remain a
parliamentary minority, an artificial tension with the Catalans is likely to
become the hallmark of Spanish politics as the CiU struggles to build up
nationalist support in Catalonia.
Political theatrics aside, the open declaration of support for the budget by
the CiU on Wednesday gives Mr Gonzalez a badly-needed breathing space.
It is unlikely he will now be seriously troubled in parliament until the
next budget in a year's time.

FT  15 OCT 93 / VW plans to reduce output next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN, Europe's biggest volume carmaker, has started laying plans to
cut production next year, indicating continuing pessimism within the group
on market prospects.
Workers' representatives and management will start talks soon to discuss
short-time working at the group's German factories for the first quarter of
1994, a spokesman said yesterday.
The agenda would include a possible extension of the Christmas and New Year
holiday shut-down, he added.
He dismissed as speculation reports in a Wolfsburg newspaper that the local
factory, the biggest in the group, with some 53,000 employees, would shut
down for 47 days next year and that other plants could close for up to 60
days.
The only concrete decision taken so far was to stop production for six days
at VW's smallest works, a half-finished assembly plant in Mosel, eastern
Germany.
The VW group, which includes the Volkswagen and Audi marques, Seat in Spain
and Skoda in the Czech Republic, cut output 19 per cent in the first six
months this year.
The group is certain to post a substantial loss for the full year following
the recent disclosure of an unexpected deficit of DM1.25bn (Pounds 508m) at
its Seat subsidiary.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Lufthansa employees win 2.5% pay rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE first significant pay settlement in west Germany's 1994 wages round has
resulted in an estimated annual increase of around 2.5 per cent for 49,000
Lufthansa employees.
Following a 12-month freeze, during which prices rose by 4 per cent, the
agreement signalled further real losses of earning power among the airline's
workforce. The cost-of-living index is expected to rise 3.5 per cent during
1994.
The deal, negotiated by the oTV public service union, increased expectations
of a non-inflationary award for the country's 2.3m other public-sector
workers. Negotiations are due to begin next month.
Main elements of the Lufthansa package were a one-off payment of DM870
(Pounds 353.60) for the six months to the end of next March, followed by a
general 2.7 per cent rise covering the period until September 31 1994.
The agreement, reached quickly without any sign of conflict, prompted one
analyst to forecast that settlements for the whole of west German industry
would average less than 3 per cent.
Meanwhile, chemicals industry employers yesterday continued their propaganda
campaign, hammering home the message of severe difficulties and continuing
job losses.

FT  15 OCT 93 / W Europe car sales fall 10.7%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEST EUROPEAN new car sales fell by an estimated 10.7 per cent in September,
to 845,000.
Demand has dropped sharply for nine months in succession. New car sales in
the first three quarters of the year declined by 15.7 per cent to 8.88m
according to industry estimates.
In the first nine months of the year 1.66m fewer new cars have been sold in
west Europe than in the same period a year ago, as the motor industry
suffers a steeper sales decline than during the recession following the
first oil crisis in the early 1970s.
New car sales both in September and in the first nine months were lower than
a year ago in 15 of 17 markets across west Europe, with demand growing only
in the UK and marginally in Norway.
The severity of the decline suffered in the first half of the year appears
to have moderated slightly in the last two months, however.
Among the large-volume markets, new car sales in Germany fell by an
estimated 14 per cent in September compared with the decline of 19 per cent
recorded in the first nine months.
In Italy sales fell by 13.9 per cent in September compared with a 22.3 per
cent drop in the first three-quarters of the year, while in Spain a fall of
16.3 per cent in September compared with a drop of 25.3 per cent in the
first nine months.
The pace of decline in France was little changed, with a drop of 16.2 per
cent year-on-year in September and of 17.2 per cent in the first nine
months.
The UK remains the only significant market in west Europe, where new car
sales are rising, with an increase year-on-year of close to 12 per cent both
in September and in the first nine months.
The steep fall in sales has forced nearly all carmakers in Europe to reduce
their production and workforces sharply. Four of the big six volume
carmakers - Volkswagen, Fiat, PSA Peugeot Citroen, and Ford of Europe - were
in loss in the first half of the year, while profits have fallen heavily at
Renault and at GM Europe.
Among volume carmakers Volkswagen and Fiat have lost most ground this year
with sales plunging over 21 per cent in the first nine months.
General Motors - Opel in continental Europe and Vauxhall in the UK -
continued to outperform its rivals, raising its market share to 13 per cent
from 12.3 per cent a year ago. Opel/Vauxhall is the best-selling car brand
in Europe ahead of Ford and Volkswagen.
Mercedes-Benz and Saab raised sales strongly in September, helped by the
launch of new models.
Rover, the subsidiary of British Aerospace, is the only significant carmaker
in Europe to have increased its sales volume this year.

Carmakers will radically change the materials they use in cars in the coming
decade as steel and cast iron increasingly give way to aluminium and
plastics, and to a lesser extent magnesium, writes Kevin Done.
According to a report by the Economist Intelligence Unit the motor industry
is on the threshold of a significant change in the use of materials in the
race to save weight and to respond to environmental pressures.
The use of aluminium by the world car industry is forecast almost to double
by the end of the decade and the use of plastics will increase by more than
30 per cent.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Nissan and Sunderland FC cry foul in a local derby
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN MOTOR UK and Sunderland football club, two determined and powerful
teams, are in a head-on clash.
At issue are Sunderland's plans to build an all-seater stadium next door to
the carmaker's Pounds 900m plant to satisfy the requirements of the Taylor
report on soccer ground safety.
Sunderland FC wants to leave its Victorian ground at Roker Park in the city
centre and develop a Pounds 70m 40,000-seat stadium, entertainment and
conference complex with an 11,000-space car park on green belt land
alongside the carmaker's 800-acre site.
The proposal has appalled Nissan, which chose Wearside nine years ago for
Europe's first and biggest Japanese car factory and now employs 4,600
people. It says it did not think in 1984 that it needed to buy the adjacent
site - on which the club now has an option - as it was designated green belt
land.
Nissan says the stadium would block future expansion and jeopardise its
just-in-time component supply schedules by creating traffic chaos on
surrounding roads.
Nissan says it has seven component suppliers within a three-mile radius
making deliveries to feed the production line. 'There's a tolerance of
minutes - if the delivery doesn't arrive within that time, we stop the
factory,' says Mr Les Nicholls, Nissan's engineering director.
Mr Nicholls says the car plant and the leisure complex are incompatible. 'We
can't both be successful. Either one will fail, or they will both gradually
drift into mediocrity.'
Mr Bob Murray, Sunderland chairman, yesterday attacked Nissan for opposing
the club's plans, which, he said, would create 2,000 jobs. He said the
company should do more for Wearside, given the 'couple of hundred million
pounds' of public money it had received.
The club unfavourably compared Nissan's contribution of 'under Pounds
12,000' to the club with Toyota's near-Pounds 100,000 investment in Derby
County.
Mr John Wood, a Sunderland club director, said: 'Nissan make great play of
their just-in-time deliveries. We're very aware of that. No-one can always
have unimpeded access anywhere.'
To cap its public relations offensive, the club announced that Mr Murray
planned to give a 51 per cent stake in Sunderland to a charitable trust so
the people of the north-east could regard the new complex as 'their' centre.
Nissan, which spends Pounds 100,000 a year on charities in the area, rejects
the claim that it should do more for Wearside.
The club's application will be considered by Sunderland city council's
environment committee in December or January. The planning position is
unclear; although green belt now, the land is earmarked in the draft unitary
development plan as a strategic site for a large development.
The plan may be called in by the environment secretary, possibly leading to
a public inquiry, but first the city council must decide its view.
The man with the unenviable job of guiding it is director of architecture
and planning Mr Ed Robson - ironically the man who co-ordinated the local
authorities' battle to win the Nissan investment.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Jobless total falls but engineers warn of shake-out: Hopes
of a sustained recovery marred by renewed fears on inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONFUSION ABOUT the strength of the UK recovery grew yesterday as news of a
surprise fall in unemployment last month coincided with predictions of
thousands of engineering redundancies and a British Aerospace announcement
of 1,000 planned job cuts.
The 13,600 drop in the seasonally adjusted jobless total to 2.908m in
September was the sixth monthly fall so far this year and took unemployment
to its lowest level since October 1992.
But the upbeat message of the figures was overshadowed by renewed fears of
inflationary pressures in the economy, with Department of Employment figures
indicating that the rate of growth in average earnings has not much further
to fall.
Yesterday's news rounded off a week of dismal economic figures - including a
drop in manufacturing output over the summer - which cast doubt on the
robustness of the recovery.
Together they may add to pressure on Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to
avoid sharp tax increases in the November Budget and sanction an early cut
in interest rates.
Despite the drop in the jobless total, the Engineering Employers Federation
warned that the recovery in engineering output had halted and that a further
60,000 jobs were yet to be lost.
The federation, which represents 4,800 companies, accused the Treasury of
being 'isolated from the real world' and said there were no prospects of a
strong recovery in west European markets until 1995.
BAe announced it was cutting 1,000 jobs across four plants in England and
Scotland, reflecting its difficulties in depressed world markets for
aircraft and defence equipment.
The problems facing the manufacturing sector were highlighted in the
official unemployment figures which showed that in spite of the overall fall
in the jobless total, manufacturing employment dropped a seasonally adjusted
24,000 in August, following July's fall of 11,000.
However, the chancellor's room for manoeuvre on interest rates may be
curtailed by signs that inflation is creeping up. Mixed news on earnings
growth yesterday added to these worries.
Average earnings rose an underlying 3.5 per cent in the year to August,
still the slowest rate for 25 years. But earnings for manufacturing are
rising faster than other sectors even though it suffered heavy job losses in
July and August. In the year to August, average earnings in manufacturing
rose 4.75 per cent compared with 2.75 per cent for the service sector.
The Department of Employment believes earnings for the whole economy -
dragged down by the 1.5 per cent pay settlement imposed on the public sector
 -have hit bottom.
The latest labour market figures also show a drop in productivity growth,
reflecting the fall in manufacturing output over the summer. Output per head
grew 5.1 per cent in the three months to August, compared with the previous
three months, down from 6.7 per cent in July.
Unit wage costs - which fell sharply until April - registered their smallest
fall so far this year, dropping 0.6 per cent in the three months to August
against a fall of 1.8 per cent in July.
Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, pointed out that the number of
people out of work and claiming benefit had fallen by 84,000 this year.
'This welcome news confirms the underlying strength of the UK economy,' he
said. 'Inflation is under control, earnings growth continues to moderate,
productivity is at record levels and the UK's flexible, deregulated labour
market is now bringing unemployment down.'
Mr Frank Dobson, the shadow employment secretary, said a long-term
commitment to full employment was needed.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Senior defence posts face Treasury threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREASURY is targeting senior Ministry of Defence staff and officers in
the armed forces as part of the drive to meet public spending targets for
the next three years.
Ministers believe planned cuts at this level are not proceeding quickly
enough.
They are understood to be taking a tough line in the face of MoD arguments
that a root and branch management reform has made it necessary to retain a
high proportion of senior staff while cutting junior ranks.
According to official figures, the number of officers employed by the MoD
fell by just 1.6 per cent between 1980 and 1992, while the number of army
privates and those of equivalent rank dropped by more than a quarter.
Talks aimed at setting departmental budgets until 1996-97 continued
yesterday morning in the cabinet's so-called EDX committee, with ministers
confident a settlement will be reached, as planned, by the end of this
month.
Some relatively low-spending departments, including the Foreign Office, are
understood to be close to settling. The tightest squeeze is being imposed in
the later years.
The focus on MoD staffing comes as senior Tory backbenchers are preparing to
use next week's two-day defence debate in the Commons to mount a rearguard
action against the threat of further defence cuts.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, has demanded a full-scale review
of Britain's armed forces if the Treasury refuses to drop its demands for
further cuts.
But a former armed forces minister last night called for a reduction in
troop levels in Northern Ireland, saying the deployment of British soldiers
in other countries had been limited because of the commitment to the
province.
The MoD argues that if the number of senior staff had been trimmed more
quickly, it would have been harder to implement its New Management Strategy
 -introduced in 1991 - under which responsibility for many functions is
being delegated away from the centre.
It says that if agreed targets for efficiency improvements are met, its mix
of staff should be for it to decide and not the Treasury. In 1991/92, the
last year for which figures are available, the department exceeded its
target by Pounds 44m or 22 per cent. Some MoD advisers acknowledge that
significant cuts at senior and middle-management level should be feasible
within a few years, once the reforms implemented under NMS have bedded down.
While a drive to encourage early retirement in senior MoD ranks could help
the government achieve the control totals under negotiation, it will be of
less assistance in reducing the proportion of Britain's gross domestic
product accounted for by public spending. This is because the pensions of
former MoD employees no longer count towards the control total but are part
of general government expenditure.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Pressure on ERM as Belgian franc hits new low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European exchange rate mechanism yesterday came under its heaviest
pressure since the currency crisis at the beginning of August that led to
the widening of the ERM fluctuation bands to 15 per cent.
The Belgian franc hit a new low against the D-Mark in spite of support from
the country's central bank. The French franc also fell sharply as dealers
speculated that a cut in French interest rates was imminent.
The Belgian central bank again denied that the bank was considering a change
in its strategy of shadowing the D-Mark but a bank official said: 'The
markets are so volatile that it's very difficult to plan a policy.'
Belgium's central interest rate was left unchanged at 9.65 per cent, but in
London the Belgian franc fell below the psychologically important barrier of
BFr22 to the D-Mark for the first time. It recovered slightly to close at
BFr21.97, down from BFr21.89 at Wednesday's close, and well below its old
ERM floor of BFr21.095 under the 2.25 per cent bands. However in late New
York trading it continued to hover around BFr22.03.
Pressure on the Belgian currency was exacerbated by comments attributed to
Mr Jacques Poos, Luxembourg's foreign minister, which increased speculation
about the future of the 71-year-old currency association between the two
countries.
In an interview with L'Echo, Belgium's francophone business newspaper, Mr
Poos said the Grand Duchy would continue to 'march alongside' Belgium as
long as it stuck to its 'franc fort' policy. But he added: 'If it abandons
that policy, we will have to rely on our own means.'
The French franc fell by more than a centime against the D-Mark, hitting
FFr3.5425 at one stage, well below its former ERM floor before currency
bands were widened to 15 per cent in August. It recovered to close at
FFr3.52, as the Bank of France kept its principal rate unchanged at 6.75 per
cent but slipped in New York to FFr3.537. Spain's half point cut in its key
money rate to 9.5 per cent boosted Spanish government bonds and helped the
peseta, although a rate cut would normally tend to weaken a currency.
Mr Nicholas Parsons, an economist with the Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce, said: 'The Spanish cut showed the way but the French and Belgians
have been fighting . . . to keep rates high. The subsequent strength of the
peseta shows it is not lower rates but the absence of growth caused by high
rates which is killing the currencies.'

banking arm

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BENETTON family has agreed to let Banco Ambrosiano Veneto (Ambroveneto)
take a 10 per cent stake in 21,Investimenti, their merchant banking arm.
21,Investimenti, owned by the Benettons through their main holding, Edizone
Holding, was formed two years ago with a L40bn (Dollars 25.1m) capital.
Ambroveneto is expected to pay L6bn for the shareholding, which in turn will
prompt a capital increase.
Benetton, Italy's biggest producer of casual clothes, has used
21,Investimenti to invest in high-quality brand names that coincide with the
group's sport and green life-style image. The investments include a 50 per
cent stake in TWR, the UK sports car company.
Ambroveneto is Italy's largest private bank. It is one of the first
instances of an Italian bank taking advantage of new legislation permitting
them to invest directly in businesses.

Wella holding
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DESCENDANTS of Mr Franz Stroeher, the founder of Wella, the German personal
care products manufacturer, will offer a portion of their stake in the
company as common shares on German and Swiss stock exchanges, AP-DJ reports
from Darmstadt.
The Stroeher family still owns 66.8 per cent of the company's share capital
and will offer 20 per cent of their stake - 13.4 per cent of the company -
to cover inheritance taxes, Mr Peter Zuehlsdorff, the chairman, said
yesterday.
The timing of the issue has not been determined.
Wella will propose the transformation of registered ordinary stock into
ordinary bearer shares at an extraordinary shareholders' meeting. Following
this change, the shares would be listed in Frankfurt, Berlin, Vienna,
Zurich, Geneva and Basle.
Preferred shares, which represent 33.2 per cent of the company's capital,
are already traded publicly.
An undetermined portion of the newly available common shares would be
offered to owners of the company's preferred shares but no price has been
set for the shares. No capital increase is planned, Mr Zuehlsdorff said.
Wella has previously reported that sales for the first nine months of 1993
were up a sluggish 3.2 per cent over the same period last year.
However, Mr Zuehlsdorff said the company expects full-year sales growth to
reach 6 per cent, for a total of DM2.9bn, citing a strong increase in recent
months.
A first-time consolidation of brands acquired from SmithKline Beecham in
June will also boost the full-year figure, he added.
Mr Zuehlsdorff also said he expects profits for the year to grow more
quickly than sales.
The company said that two-thirds of the increase in the 1993 dividend would
reflect tax changes which have reduced corporation tax. Wella paid a
dividend of DM9 a share on ordinary stock on 1992 results and DM10 on
preference shares.

ROTHSCHILD, the German banking arm of the Rothschild family banking group,
is to expand its operations in Germany by providing additional services to
private and institutional investors.
The Rothschild empire was founded in Frankfurt in 1792 but the family left
Germany in 1901, returning only in 1989 when it opened a joint
representative office for its London, Paris and Zurich operations. Since
1989, Rothschild's German business has been concentrated on corporate
finance and private client activities.

OCE-VAN der Grinten, the Dutch photocopier and office equipment maker,
reported a 26 per cent fall in third-quarter net profit. This comes after
declines of nearly 50 per cent in each of the first two quarters of 1993.
Net profit fell to Fl 13.9m (Dollars 7.7m) from Fl 18.8m in the third
quarter of 1992.
Figures for the nine-months were down 42 per cent at Fl 40.6m.
The company blamed the decline on lower sales, caused mainly by the weakness
of European economies and which extended the first-half trend.
The depreciation of important currencies against the Dutch guilder continued
in the third quarter, but at a reduced rate.
Third-quarter sales fell by 6 per cent to Fl 603m. In the first three
quarters taken together, sales declined by 7 per cent to Fl 1.85bn.
Oce-van der Grinten said it would pay an unchanged interim dividend of Fl
0.90. However, it said the interim dividend should not be seen as an
indication of the level of the final dividend.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Kohl urges EC to resist protectionism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN Chancellor Helmut Kohl told the French Senate yesterday that
Europeans should 'resist the temptation of protectionism', in a speech
clearly designed to influence France's position in world trade talks.
His call won swift praise from Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade
representative, who was holding negotiations with the EC in Brussels on the
Uruguay Round. Mr Kantor said he was pleased Mr Kohl was 'seized with the
importance of restoring growth in Europe' and emphasised that 'increased
competition rather than building a wall around the EC is an absolute
necessity'.
Mr Kantor was firm on French demands that the US-EC Blair House agreement on
cutting Europe's subsidised farm exports be amended: 'We are not going to
reopen or renegotiate the Blair House agreement,' he said.
Meanwhile in Paris, in a speech to the National Assembly, prime minister
Edouard Balladur yesterday gave little sign of conceding on the substance of
France's demands in the Gatt talks.
Calling for government and opposition parties to unite to defend 'our
country's national interests', he cited unfulfilled demands on steel,
aerospace, transport and market access, and warned that France would not
allow itself to be 'forced to take one extra hectare of land out of
production' when countries such as the US were putting set-aside land back
into production.
Mr Balladur said France would settle for a Gatt accord in the form of 'a
progress report' by the December 15 negotiating deadline 'if certain
partners were to propose this'. He thus appeared to back away from the
campaign that his ministers have been waging for an 'interim Gatt' deal this
year, leaving the contentious issues of agriculture and broadcasting for
later.
On audio-visual services, the EC and US appeared to make progress towards a
compromise in the Brussels talks. It now appears the EC is proposing the
sector should remain in the Uruguay Round, but with the focus on abolition
of EC quota restrictions on imported films and television programmes. This
would allow European governments to continue subsidising their entertainment
industries.
Stressing the need for freer trade, particularly with east Europe, Mr Kohl
said 'West Europeans would be committing a fatal error if they thought that
in removing competition by closing their markets they could benefit in any
way whatsoever'.
Using his Senate speech to try to give new impetus to the battered
French-German alliance as well as to the EC, Mr Kohl said it was inevitable
that the Bonn-Paris axis was sometimes prone to 'disillusions and doubts'.
But the two countries shared a common fate and must form 'the heart of the
European Union', created by the Maastricht treaty.
After Tuesday's German court approval of Maastricht - which gives the French
government the green light to put the Bank of France's independent status
into effect - Mr Kohl called for strict observance of the treaty's
'timetable and conditions to ensure monetary stability'.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Papandreou halts Greece's telecoms privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   ATHENS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW Greek Socialist government yesterday announced it would cancel the
partial privatisation of the telecommunications company OTE, raising fears
about the future of other sell-offs planned by the former conservative
government.
Mr Andreas Papandreou, whose Panhellenic Socialist Movement was returned to
power in Sunday's general election, made the announcement on television at
the start of his new cabinet's first meeting. Mr Papandreou had claimed
during the election campaign that Pasok was now committed to co-operating
with the private sector and to further liberalising Greece's financial
markets.
The previous conservative government had also earmarked two state-owned oil
refineries for sale this year although plans were only at an early stage. A
series of commercial plans, including the award of new casino licences and
several development projects are also now in doubt.
The telecommunications law, passed two months ago, provided for the sale of
49 per cent of OTE. Negotiations started earlier this year with six
international operators shortlisted to buy a strategic 35 per cent stake in
the company.
Preparations were also underway to float OTE on the Athens stock exchange
with the sale of 10 per cent of the company to the public and 4 per cent to
employees.
A group of international merchant banks, including Credit Suisse, First
Boston, J. Henry Schroder Wagg and NM Rothschild, Morgan Stanley and Paribas
Capital Markets, were handling the flotation. CSFB was also advising on the
strategic sale.
Pasok sources said agreements with several foreign merchant banks were being
terminated.
Mr Gerry Grimstone, a corporate finance director at J. Henry Schroder Wagg,
the merchant bank which had been appointed to handle the offer to the public
of shares in OTE, said the bank had not yet received instructions from the
Greek government.
However, Mr Evricos Sarsentis, a Greek analyst at J. Henry Schroder Wagg,
said Schroder hoped the flotation would still go ahead.
Neither Schroders nor NM Rothschild, which has been advising the Greek
government on the privatisation programme as a whole, are expected to sue
the government for breaking their contracts. One banker said: 'It is all
part of the rich tapestry of investment banking'.
Schroders and other advisers have already done a lot of work on the OTE
deal, which was originally planned for November, although it had been
hitting delays before the election. The proposed sale was fiercely opposed
by the OTE union and by local suppliers of telecoms equipment, who feared
they would be squeezed out by competition from abroad once an international
operator took over management of the company.
The new prime minister has announced his intention of giving a cabinet post
to Mr Dimitris Tsovolas, finance minister during Pasok's last term, who was
convicted last year by a special court on charges of breach of trust while
in office.
The new cabinet was sworn in yesterday. Mr Papandreou did not appoint a
deputy prime minister, but created a special cabinet post for Mr Antonis
Livanis, a close adviser.
The post of economy minister went to Mr Giorgos Gennimatas, who is suffering
from cancer.
The foreign minister will be Mr Carolos Papoulias. Ms Melina Mercouri heads
the culture ministry.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Bell Atlantic to buy US cable company for Dollars 18bn: Deal
with TCI set to transform telecommunications industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BELL ATLANTIC, the US regional telephone group, yesterday announced an
agreement to buy Tele-Communications Inc, the largest American cable
television company, for up to Dollars 18bn in a deal which will radically
change the US communications industry. It will also be one of the country's
biggest ever takeovers.
The deal - which is bound to face strong regulatory scrutiny - would be the
first full merger between a US telephone company and a cable business at a
time when the two industries are converging to create a single, multi-media
inter-active entertainment and information business.
Bell Atlantic, the telecommunications group serving the middle part of
America's eastern seaboard, has been one of the most aggressive telephone
companies trying to enter the video industry.
TCI, based in Denver, has been built up by Mr John Malone, its chief
executive, over the past 20 years into a company serving some 20 per cent of
cable homes.
The share swap deal would also include Liberty Media, a cable programming
company which TCI spun off in 1991. It announced plans to re-acquire the
business last Friday.
Yesterday's pact could have implications for the current takeover battle for
entertainment group Paramount Communications.
Liberty Media is an important shareholder in QVC Network, the home shopping
channel headed by Mr Barry Diller, which is making a hostile Dollars 9.5bn
bid for Paramount, in competition with a Dollars 7.5bn agreed bid from cable
company Viacom.
Analysts said the Bell Atlantic deal could help strengthen QVC's position.
Mr Malone said yesterday that the QVC bid was peripheral to the Bell
Atlantic deal, though he wished Mr Diller the best of luck and would
personally do what he could to help him.
Viacom, which has launched a legal suit trying to block the QVC bid because
of Mr Malone's alleged 'monopolistic intentions' in the cable industry,
yesterday called on Congress to 'take a hard look' at Mr Malone's record.
Mr Raymond Smith, chairman of Bell Atlantic, yesterday hailed yesterday's
agreement as a 'model for communications companies in the next century.'
A letter of intent between the two groups calls for most of TCI and
Liberty's assets to be merged into Bell Atlantic, apart from cable service
companies owned in the region where Bell Atlantic is a telephone operator.
These would be sold or spun off to shareholders separately.
Under the 1984 cable act regional telecommunications companies are forbidden
from buying cable companies in the area where they operate telephone
services.
The deal values TCI at Dollars 11.8bn, excluding the Liberty Media
programming assets, which would be worth some Dollars 5bn to Dollars 6bn
more if included in the takeover. Bell Atlantic would also take on some
Dollars 9.6bn of debt.
The approximate Dollars 28bn total compares with the Dollars 25bn value of
the 1989 takeover of RJR Nabisco in a leveraged buy-out by Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts, which also assumed some Dollars 4.5bn of debt.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Flotation of Inmarsat would create company worth Dollars 2bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INMARSAT, the international satellite operator owned by 71 of the world's
telecommunications authorities and companies, will next year propose its
effective flotation.
The move would create a company likely to be worth more than Dollars 2bn.
The biggest shareholder is Comsat, the publicly quoted US company, with 24.6
per cent. British Telecom comes next with 11.7 per cent,followed by
Norwegian Telecom with 10.7 per cent and Japan's KDD with 9.1 per cent.
Inmarsat was established in 1979 to provide satellite communications for
shipping. It has since expanded into land and air mobile communications and
is now used for telephones and faxes in passenger aircraft and by
newsgathering and emergency services.
The organisation's annual turnover exceeds Dollars 300m and it has a
'surplus', equivalent to a profit, of about Dollars 100m a year. Its annual
growth has exceeded 20 per cent for the last four years.
The mechanism likely to be put to Inmarsat's owners early next year is that
their stakes become tradeable with each other. From there it is a relatively
small step to allowing third parties to buy stakes in Inmarsat.
If Inmarsat were to be valued on a similar basis to companies such as BT or
Cable and Wireless, it would be worth more than Dollars 2bn.
On a valuation of Dollars 2bn, BT's stake in Inmarsat would be worth Dollars
236m, compared with its net investment so far of Dollars 35m.
Inmarsat has in recent months laid plans to move into mass markets for
mobile communications.
It wants to build a global mobile telecommunications network based on its
satellites. But the scheme is bringing it into conflict with private sector
companies, such as Motorola, which plan similar networks.
'We're operating in an increasingly competitive environment. It is useful to
have an accurate value of shareholders' investment', said Mr Ramin Khadem,
Inmarsat's chief financial officer.
Mr Bruce Crockett, chairman and chief executive of Comsat, Inmarsat's
biggest stakeholder, said he supported moves towards flotation.
'It would allow other (companies) to become owners. That makes a lot of
sense', he said.
He added that such a market would yield high valuations for stakes.
BT took a more cautious line yesterday, saying that it would make up its
mind after a study group had made a report in February 1994.
Mr Crockett said it was 'inevitable' that a similar move would be considered
by Inmarsat's sister organisation, Intelsat, which operates satellites for
non-mobile communications.
Intelsat's sales exceed Dollars 600m a year, but growth is slower and it
faces competition from cable-based telecommunications.

FT  14 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Insurers rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Composite insurers rallied in the afternoon after strong selling in the
early part of the session had caused a sharp retreat. Several market
watchers had attributed the early decline to a negative note from Kleinwort
Benson, but the securities house denied any such move. Commercial Union
finished 12 off at 631p, and General Accident lost 14 to 723p. Royal
Insurance shed 7 to 308p, after trade of 5.8m.
Oil stocks saw an active day with a variety of triggers sparking trading.
With second-line stocks attracting investor interest, one specialist
suggested that the sector may be shaping up for a substantial reshuffle.
'Some stocks have gone as far as they are going while others are beginning
to attract interest and be regarded as having potential.'
He added that many second-line stocks had steadily been moving themselves
into strong positions. 'Many have gone through the pain barrier and this is
beginning to be recognised. There's a feeling of recovery in the air.'
Added to this is the momentum that a more stable oil price has given to the
sector.
Enterprise Oil moved strongly ahead after announcing an add-on discovery of
oil in a North Sea development. Its price gained 6 to 471p in good volume of
1.7m. Rumours moved through the market of a possible asset swap between
Enterprise and Monument Oil and Gas with the two looking at an exchange of
activities to balance long and short-term activities. Monument ended the day
unchanged at 52 (and three quarters) after a slightly erratic performance.
Lasmo struggled a little to hold its price and lost 1 1/2 to close at 137
1/2 p.
Figures from Darty, the French electrical retailer owned by Kingfisher,
impacted badly on the parent company's shares. They closed off 10 at 646p.
Stores analysts said that although not as bad as had been expected given the
state of the French economy, some investors had used the excuse to take
profits after the stock's recent good run.
Do It All owners WH Smith and Boots continued to be buoyed along on the
hopes that the expected forthcoming rationalisation is as painless as hoped
for. Talk in the market suggests that the companies will probably close
around 60 sites, but that a fair chunk of these may have already been sold
to other retailers. Smith shares added 3 to 465p, Boots steadied at 502p.
Among banks, broker Smith New Court gained 8 to 378p, after rival BZW was
reported to have upgraded profit expectations. Strong two way business in
National Westminster brought volume of 8.2m, as the shares firmed a penny to
555p.
Shares in Automated Security, under a cloud since last week's profits
warning bounced 16 to 113p, after the company chairman bought 250,000 at
101p.
Talk of cuts in infrastructure spending continued to overhang BICC, which is
heavily involved in road building activity through its Balfour Beatty
subsidiary. The shares lost another 10 to 397p.
Nervous trading ahead of next week's figures weakened Smiths Industries
where the shares fell 4 to 371p. TI Group, whose shares perked up earlier
this week after it announced disposals worth Pounds 40m was said to have
suffered from a stock overhang. The poor market trend together with general
profit-taking saw engineering group Siebe give up 8 to 524. A gain for
Pearson of 2 to 544p came against a generally downbeat media sector. The
rise coincided with the launch by SG Warburg of a multi-media warrant
comprising a basket of stocks, mostly with European interests.
Elsewhere, VAT fears gripped publishing stocks with Daily Mail Trust falling
75p to 944; Mirror Group losing 5 to 163p and News International giving up 2
to 268p.
Building materials group MB-Caradon, which yesterday said it is changing its
name to Caradon at the end of the month, closed 3 ahead at 339p, after
announcing a 94.8 per cent take up of its Pounds 334m rights issue. The
outstanding rump had been placed with institutions.
An optimistic annual meeting at Ellis and Everard saw the shares bounce 6 to
223p. The company will have an opportunity to sustain investor interest
later this week when it hosts lunches with fund managers at a leading London
stockbroker.
ICI failed to keep a grip on an early lead and its shares ended unchanged at
723p in modest volume. An announcement that it was restructuring interests
in South Africa was not considered particularly sensitive to share earnings.
A stock overhang, said to involve one broker trying to place a lump of 5m
shares, restricted Storehouse, off 7 at 200p.

An upbeat response from British Aerospace (BAe) after the government of
Taiwan said it would not try to save the proposed Pounds 250m joint venture
between BAe and Taiwan Aerospace Corporation (TAC), brought a two-way pull
in the shares.
The news from Taiwan led to an early fall in the shares to the day's low of
399p. However, the strong response from the company saying, 'we are still
hopeful of the deal', along with a feeling from analysts that the bad news
surrounding the deal was already in the price, brought a turnaround.
Researchers also believe that failure to clinch the deal is no longer as
significant to the company's finances as it would have been earlier this
year.
The shares closed a penny ahead at 408p, on volume of 3.9m with traders
saying 400p had proved a good support level for the shares. However, UBS was
said to have advised investors to 'sell' the shares.

FT  14 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Utilities wanted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The utility stocks attracted further interest in the wake of the poor
inflation figures, with water shares the best performing sector in the UK
market yesterday. Yield and defensive considerations were investors'
priorities as water shares surged, with several broker recommendations
helping sentiment. Northumbrian jumped 16 to 680p, Southern 15 to 593p and
Welsh 12 to 658p. Among the Recs, South West gained 9 to 559p and East
Midland 5 to 567p. Kleinwort Benson was among those recommending both
stocks.
News that Oftel was recommending further liberalising moves in the UK
telecoms market added to the attractions of BT's rivals. While BT shares
retreated 4 1/2 to 440 1/2 p, Vodafone added 4 to 540 1/2 , Securicor 15 to
770p and Cable and Wireless 16 to 927p.

FT  14 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Forte float surprises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE announcement by Forte of its intention to float its airport services
division early next year caught the market by surprise and led to a roller
coaster day for the shares. At the outset, they shot up on the news only to
tumble to 217p at the day's worst. Then, the shares rallied up to 225p,
eventually drifting back to close at 222 1/2 p, a net 5 down on the day, on
turnover reaching an average 2.6m.
Leisure analysts were puzzled by both the timing of the announcement and the
reaction of the shares. Although there has been talk of the move for several
weeks, the news was not expected until next year, with a flotation predicted
in early 1994. Speculation that Forte was more anxious than previously
thought to reduce its gearing was heard among leisure specialists, most of
whom put the group's debts at around Pounds 1.2bn to June 1994.
Estimates of the airport catering division's worth are above Pounds 200m,
with the effect on Forte's balance sheet around Pounds 150m if it retains
its 25 per cent stake, as proposed. With more sales forthcoming, Forte's
debt situation should become more manageable. The sale of its Harvester pub
chain - Allied Lyons is now being strongly tipped as the buyer - is expected
shortly, and should contribute some Pounds 100m. The expected flotation of
Gardner Merchant - in which Forte has a 25 per cent stake - next year could
give another Pounds 120m. Selected hotel sales could also contribute.
Mr Bruce Jones at Smith New Court commented: 'The potentially brighter debt
picture makes it increasingly unlikely that Forte will need to have a rights
issue.' Allied Lyons shares slipped 5 to 567p.

FT  14 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Economic data upset share prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LATEST data on the domestic economy unsettled the London stock market
badly yesterday. However, shares rallied well before the close on hopes that
the unexpected fall in manufacturing output will limit the scale of any tax
increases in next month's budget from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor
of the exchequer.
Base rate optimism remained a factor, in spite of the rise in September
annualised inflation rate and consequent easing in the pound.
The FT-SE Index closed 13.8 down at 3,080.9 but had rallied from the day's
low in the 3,071 area to which it had fallen after the announcement of a 0.4
per cent dip in UK manufacturing output in August. The stock market had
already reacted badly to news that annualised inflation had risen by 1.8 per
cent in September, for the third consecutive monthly increase.
These statistics 'must be a clear disappointment to the stock market and the
chancellor of the exchequer,' commented one of the market's leading economic
commentators. However, the indication that the economic recovery in the UK
is still fragile and inflation by no means dead means, according to equity
strategists, that the scope of the chancellor to increase taxes in November
is now 'very limited indeed'.
For the near term view in the stock market, this sounded like relatively
good news and the initial setback in shares was soon checked. Helped by a
similar rally in bonds and by continuing firmness in short sterling, the
stock market reduced its losses and trading volume increased.
By the close, Seaq volume had jumped to 659.2m shares from the 537.1m of the
previous session. Tuesday's retail trading value of Pounds 1.24bn confirmed
the healthy levels of genuine investment activity.
Non-Footsie business, at around 56 per cent of the Seaq total, was around
daily average levels. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index followed the market trend,
shedding 6.6 points to 3,468.3.
Retail and consumer issues gave up a few pence on increased trading volume
as investors assessed the outlook for interest rate prospects following the
statistics on the UK economy. Building and construction shares, additionally
unsettled this week by reports that public infrastructure spending may be
targeted in next month's budget, suffered further losses.
The blue chip international stocks, however, were left on the sidelines as
attention focused on the domestic economy. With Wall Street quiet overnight
and only about 5 points up in its new session during London hours, there was
little lead for the transatlantic issues.
Both oil and pharmaceutical stocks were a few pence easier amid signs that
the institutions were shuffling portfolios in these heavily-weighted sectors
rather than changing their investment stance towards them.
Today brings another round of important UK economic data, with the stock
market likely to focus on the unemployment figures for last month which will
now be scanned with increased attention for evidence of the pace of economic
recovery. Forecasts range from around 5,000 either side of the previous
month's total. Also due today are the latest earnings and unit wage costs.

FT  14 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISAPPOINTING UK economic data accelerated the slide of Footsie futures
yesterday while index options were once again brisk, writes Christine
Buckley.
After a shaky opening, the December contract on the FT-SE 100 mustered a
small rise ahead of publication of figures for retail prices inflation and
manufacturing output for August. But the statistics put the contract on a
skid from 3,120 to 3,110 where it managed to find some support.
However, that support was not to prove durable and the contract fell below
the important psychological level of 3,100 to touch a 3,088 low. Sellers
were evident for most of the morning's trading.
The afternoon was more positive after a bounce in short sterling kicked some
confidence back to the ailing contract. Short sterling, as in the previous
day's trading, had been bolstered by persistent hopes of an interest rate
cut.
December finished the day at 3,102 - only fractionally ahead of the fair
value premium to the cash market, which stands at about 21 points. Volume
was at its highest level for many sessions at 13,021 contracts.
Index options were healthy, forming the bulk of the traded options activity.
Of the total options volume of 35,315 lots, 23,028 were in the FT-SE 100
option and 2,989 in the Euro FT-SE. Many traders were said to be buying both
calls and putsfor maximum hedging.

FT  14 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Secondary issues at new high
levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US BLUE chip stocks firmed slightly and secondary issues set new record
highs yesterday as telecommunications, cable and entertainment company
shares rose sharply on news of one of the biggest mergers in US corporate
history, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 10.06 at 3,603.19. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.37 higher at 461.49, while
the Amex composite finished up 5.35 at 475.85, and the Nasdaq composite up
6.51 at 778.97. Trading volume on the NYSE was 292m shares.
The pattern of recent days - blue-chip stocks mostly ignored as investors
buy smaller-company and Nasdaq issues in their search for growth
opportunities - was again repeated yesterday, with secondary indices moving
to new all-time highs.
All prices moved higher from the opening, lifted by the news that
telecommunications group Bell Atlantic will merge with cable television
giant Telecommunications Inc in a deal that is valued at close to Dollars
20bn.
A spate of mergers, several of them in the telecoms and entertainment
businesses, have been announced recently, supporting investor sentiment at a
time when sluggish economic growth might otherwise be depressing share
prices.
The markets were also buoyed by the first batch of third quarter corporate
earnings releases, which on the whole have been better than analysts and
investors had expected.
Among individual stocks, TCI rose Dollars 3 to Dollars 31 3/8 on the Nasdaq
market in volume of 19m shares and Bell Atlantic firmed Dollars 5 7/8 to
Dollars 65 7/8 on the NYSE as the two companies announced a merger
agreement.
Bell will pay Dollars 11.8bn in stock for TCI, and will also assume Dollars
9.6bn in debt, which means that the ultimate value of the deal could rival
the 1989 buyout of RJR Nabisco, which until now was the biggest ever.
Other entertainment, telecommunications and cable stocks rose sharply on the
news amid hopes that similar transactions between the two industries will
soon be concluded.
Cablevision jumped Dollars 9 1/4 to Dollars 63 5/8 on the American Stock
Exchange, while on Nasdaq, Liberty Media, which is part-owned by TCI and
will also be sold to Bell Atlantic, rose Dollars 5 7/8 to Dollars 65 7/8 ,
Vanguard Cellular climbed Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 31 3/4 , Comcast added
Dollars 6 3/8 at Dollars 39 5/8 , and BroadBand Technologies climbed Dollars
5 3/4 to Dollars 43.
On the NYSE Weyerhaeuser fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 38 5/8 after the
company reported a 38 per cent decline in third quarter net income. First
Chicago added Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 50 after the banking group announced a
third quarter profit of Dollars 284m, up from the Dollars 372m loss incurred
in the same period a year ago when the company took a charge to cover asset
disposals.
Canada
TORONTO stocks closed mixed in moderate trading. The TSE-300 composite index
was up 4.48 points, or 0.11 per cent, to 4,111.79 according to preliminary
data.
Seagram gained  5/8 to 35 3/4 after disclosing that it has obtained the
marketing rights for Sweden's Absolut vodka.

CONTINUED selling of Nikkei 225 component stocks which failed to be included
into the new Nikkei 300, depressed share prices, but the index recouped some
of the morning losses on afternoon support from arbitrageurs and investment
trusts, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average fell 98.91 to 20,038.40. The index hit the day's high
of 20,167.22 before falling to the day's low of 19,997.90 in the morning
session, dropping below the psychological support level of 20,000 for the
first time since September 29.
Volume totaled 235.3m shares against 225m. Losers led winners by 639 to 349
with 175 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section
stocks fell 6.73 to 1,645.53. while in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose
0.10 to 1,276.95.
Profit-taking in stocks which were adopted for the new 300 issue index was
also noted. Some traders said index-linked selling was not helping
sentiment, already weak from pessimism over the economy.
Mr Alan Livsey, strategist at Kleinwort Benson, said few investors were
willing to take the risk of selling before a possible income tax cut and
economic recovery next year.
Among Nikkei 225 component stocks, not included in the new index, Hitachi
Zosen fell Y4 to Y375, Suzuki Motors lost Y15 to 945 and Keisei Electric
Railway declined Y20 to Y1,130.
Nikkei 300 component stocks which fell on profit-taking included House Food
Industrial, Y40 lower at Y2,710, and Secom, the security company, which lost
Y30 to Y7,060.
Video game and other entertainment companies fell on reports of poor
earnings at Konami. Konami fell by its daily limit of Y500 to Y3,930, while
Sega Enterprises plunged Y300 to Y10,100 and Nintendo lost Y180 to Y8,320.
In Osaka, the OSE average lost 93.34 to 22,251.21 in volume of 19.7m shares.
Roundup
Another impressive performance was seen in Pacific Rim markets.
HONG KONG stumbled briefly early in the day rallying to another record
finish, with property stocks again at the forefront. The Hang Seng index
rose 39.51 to 8,292.96, overcoming an early loss of 79.4 points.
Among property stocks, which have soared on analyst reratings this week,
Henderson Land rose 40 cents to HKDollars 27.70 and Cheung Kong added 25
cents to HKDollars 30.75.
AUSTRALIA bounced back after Tuesday's losses, the All Ordinaries index
rising 10.6 to 2,038.6, led by a bullish gold sector. The gold marker jumped
61.8 to 2,154.3.
NEW ZEALAND remained at a 46-month high, and the NZSE-40 index ended 1.34
higher at 2,041.12.
TAIWAN moved sharply higher after a wave of late buying in finance issues,
encouraged by continued hopes for a cut in the stock transaction tax. The
weighted index rose 52.26 or 1.3 per cent to 3,994.51 in active turnover of
TDollars 25.48bn.
MANILA finished at a third consecutive record high, with the Manila index
18.20 higher at 2,112.03.
SINGAPORE posted a third consecutive high reflecting a rally in local blue
chips as well as in Malaysian semi-blue chips traded over the counter. The
Straits Times Industrial index rose 2.41 at 2.053.88.
SEOUL moved ahead for the third straight day, in a buying spree which took
the composite index ended 16.82 ahead at 740.39.
KUALA LUMPUR regained its composure after a shaky start, fuelled by foreign
fund interest in blue-chips. The composite index finished at a sixth
consecutive high, up 5.67 at 911.38.
BANGKOK advanced 3.53 per cent after Tuesday's decline, amid strong demand
for bank stocks and the SET index rose 38.94 to 1,140.90, only 2.88 points
off its all-time closing high of 1,143.78 points set on July 25, 1990.

FT  14 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: Zimbabwe gains ground - Tony Hawkins
reports on the turn around of the equity market led by renewed foreign
buying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ten years ago Zimbabwe's finance minister Mr Bernard Chidzero denounced the
stock exchange as the 'prostitute of the economy'.
Industrial share prices, which reached a record high less than a year after
independence, plummeted to a 17 year low in 1984 as investors took fright at
President Robert Mugabe's strategy of 'socialist transformation' and Mr
Chidzero's expropriation, for balance of payments reasons, of
domestically-held foreign equities and bonds owned by Zimbabwean investors.
Today the wheel has turned full circle. In April, Mr Chidzero liberalised
the regulations governing foreign investment allowing overseas investors to
buy up to 25 per cent of companies listed on the ZSE and allowing residents
to open foreign currency deposit accounts with Zimbabwe banks.
This was followed by reductions in capital gains tax on share market
investment to 10 per cent from 30 per cent, and the withholding tax on
dividends declared by quoted companies to 15 per cent from 20 per cent. From
January companies will also be allowed to open foreign currency accounts,
having the effect of 'floating' the Zimbabwe dollar.
The impact of foreign buying on the equity market has been dramatic. The
industrial index, which reached a peak of 2,700 (Jan 1967=100) in September
1991, before losing two thirds of its value, dipping below 900 at the end of
last year, has staged a strong come back.
It began moving off the bottom in the first half of the year picking up
almost 10 per cent; but it was only when foreign buying started in late June
that the market took off, rising more than 65 per cent in the last three
months to 1,650.
Market capitalisation which had fallen from a peak of ZDollars 7bn (Dollars
1.7bn) in September 1991, to ZDollars 3.4bn at the end of last year, has
recouped all its losses, but because of devaluation it remains well below
its 1991 hard-currency high of Dollars 2.7bn.
Initial interest came from individuals, but following the tax reductions in
the July budget, emerging market funds, mainly UK-based but also some from
the Far East, the US and Australia, started buying.
Fund investors are driven primarily by price-earnings considerations. At
mid-year the Harare industrial p/e ratio of 3.9 was about half the 8.0
acceptable to fund managers, but now it is hovering around 7.6 and seems set
to move higher.
Turnover has jumped from ZDollars 750,000 (Dollars 115,000) weekly in the
first half of the year to more than ZDollars 10m (USDollars 1.5m), of which
over 40 per cent is foreign buying. In less than four months since
liberalisation, foreigners have put some ZDollars 60m (Dollars 9m) into the
market, which is more than the net inflow of foreign direct investment since
independence 13 years ago.
Ironically, foreign buyers are pushing prices up at a time when many, if not
most, of the ZSE's 62 listed companies are reporting falling earnings.
But with inflation and interest rates now on their way down and the economy
expected to register marginal growth in 1993 the market is scenting better
days ahead, though analysts expect another six to nine months of poor
corporate profits.
The IFC plans to include Zimbabwe in its investable indices from January
1994.

FT  14 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Profit-taking limits gains in
continental bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RENEWED pressure for a further round of interest rate cuts provided
background noise yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
However, Morgan Stanley commented that while they still expect European
short-term interest rates to fall below 4 per cent in the core countries by
next year, earnings growth is unlikely to be sufficient 'to prop up current
valuation levels in European equities'.
As a consequence Morgan Stanley has reduced its European equity weighting in
its model portfolio, although continuing to highlight Germany 'where the
benefits of corporate restructuring should support corporate earnings
growth'.
FRANKFURT slipped from the day's highs on late profit-taking, but the DAX
index still managed to stay just above the 2,000 level at 2,001.51, a day's
gain of 2.90.
Equity market commentators remarked that sentiment in Germany remained
positive at present, helped by Tuesday's news that the federal
constitutional court had rejected challenges to the Maastricht treaty.
Turnover was DM8.5bn.
A recent announcement that a new mutual fund was to be launched on October
20 which could inject some DM2bn into equities was also keeping sentiment
high, analysts said.
Schering rose DM50 to an all time high DM1,069 on news that production of
its Betaseron drug may be increased.
A record high was also recorded by Kloeckner, up DM7.70 to DM92.20 on
reports that its steel division might be sold. Wella put on DM26.50 to DM848
ahead of reporting after the close a rise in its dividend and plans to list
20 per cent of its ordinary shares.
PARIS was another market which lost ground in late trading, the CAC-40 index
ending up just 0.43 at 2,127.28, after a day's high of 2,144. Turnover was
FFr3.4bn.
Turbulence in the currency markets which pushed the French franc down
sharply had some effect on the market.
Generale des Eaux shed FFr39 to FFr2,618 following its announcement, widely
expected, of a FFr3-4bn rights issue by the end of the year. James Capel
kept the stock at a buy recommendation given expectations of outperformance
on a 12 month view, helped by steady development in core activities and
recovery potential in loss making businesses.
ZURICH extended its record breaking run to four sessions, the SMI index
adding 18.5 to 2,571.0. Strong demand for blue chip index heavyweights was
attributed to short covering ahead of tomorrow's futures and options expiry.
Ciba-Geigy registered shares slipped SFr2 to SFr718 in response to nine
month results and the forecast of higher full year profit, although limited
by economic conditions.
MILAN finished lower ahead of the end of the monthly account today and began
clearing the way for the Fiat rights issue. The Comit index shed 11.91 or
2.1 per cent to 568.03, with the failure of a small Milan brokerage house
also casting a shadow.
One analyst commented that the lower market was a positive sign for the Fiat
capital raising exercise since it suggested that investors were cashing in
profits in preparation for issue which begins tomorrow. Fiat shed L62 to
L5,662.
Ferruzzi was a major casualty of the session. The stock was delayed from
trading on several occasions due to order imbalances and the rapid decline
in the price. It ceased trading L101.40 or 24.8 per cent lower at L308.
AMSTERDAM saw strong support for Unilever, up Fl 3.10 to Fl 203.80 as the
CBS Tendency index added 0.1 to 128.8.
Oce, the office machines manufacturer, rose Fl 1.60 to Fl 52.80 on better
than expected third quarter results.
STOCKHOLM saw further gains in Ericsson as the Affarsvarlden general index
attempted to breach its all time high set in August 1989. However, it
finished slightly below, up 8.10 at 1,371.90.
ATHENS built on Tuesday's gains as investors decided that the election of
the socialist party to government was good news. The general index added
25.21 or nearly 3 per cent to 874.62 after a rise of 2.2 per cent on
Tuesday.
Mr Stuart Harley of Schroders commented that the market had been driven
yesterday mainly by individuals with little institutional buying noted. The
banking sector, he added, was particularly active.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Money Markets: Short rates squeeze up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORRYING statistics on inflation failed to whip the UK money markets into a
frenzy of rate cut enthusiasm yesterday, possibly because the data were
offset by tight money squeezing short term rates higher, writes Peter John.
The latest figures for retail price inflation suggested that the UK might
have tilted from a trend of low growth with no inflation to inflation with
no growth. That would be the worst possible situation for the pound and
could make the need for lower interest rates even more pressing.
However, short sterling futures which signal the market's view of where
interbank rates will be at a fixed date - and consequently, the direction of
base rates - failed to respond to the news.
The contract for December delivery closed only two basis points higher on
the day at 94.46 although turnover was very high at more than 55,000
contracts, suggesting very active two-way business.
Many traders believe that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will cut base
rates on or around the November 30 budget.
Bank of England operations were hampered by an apparent unwillingness from
the main clearing banks to borrow money. An early forecast of a Pounds
1.25bn shortage was later revised down to Pounds 1.2bn and left outstanding
for much of the day.
One dealer said: 'The daily miracle (the ability to always balance the
national books acceptably by the end of the day's dealing's) almost didn't
happen.' The central bank did not provide assistance during the early round
and bought only Pounds 53m of bills at the next available opportunity. In
the early afternoon the Bank provided a further Pounds 494 and the overnight
lending rate was pushed to 7 per cent - it has been below 4 per cent
recently. The Bank provided final assistance of Pounds 350m.
Other European short-currency futures contracts were also firmer as the
market's desire for lower rates increased. The French franc contract traded
on Liffe was higher as French call money was quoted at 7 per cent, down from
7.2 per cent. Call money usually commands a rate between the low level
intervention rate, and the upper level rate of 7.75 per cent. Analysts said
that if the call rate was quoted below 7 per cent today it would be a strong
signal that the intervention rate would fall.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange: Speculation hits Belgian franc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE for lower European interest rates and a wave of speculative
sellling hit the Belgian and French francs yesterday. Sterling also suffered
as a result of disappointing statistics on inflation and industrial
production, writes Peter John.
The Belgian franc spiked lower against the D-Mark in early European trading
as one large investor was said to have sold the currency very heavily. The
trade was apparently sparked by a report from a US financial consultancy
which painted a very grim picture of the Belgian economy.
A number of dealers said the selling might have been carried out by Mr
George Soros's Quantum Fund, which played a large part in the forced exit of
sterling from the exchange rate mechanism last year.
Mr Soros has become something of a market bogeyman and whether he was
involved or not the currency continued to be held back by what one dealer
described as 'genuine commercial selling'.
The Bank of Belgium intervened sporadically and maintained the currency
around BFr21.90 to the D-Mark. The currencyclosed at BFr21.89, down from
BFr21.78 at the close of trading on Tuesday.
Economists said the market would remain concerned at least until there is
some news next week on the Belgian government's social pact - a consensus on
how to improve companies' competitiveness, reduce labour costs and create
jobs.
Also causing investor concern are Belgium's huge national debt and lingering
worries that Luxembourg might decouple its currency from the Belgian franc.
The selling spilled over to the French franc which fell sharply as lower
overnight money rates provided signals that the Bank of France may be more
kindly disposed to lower interest rates. Also, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the
minister for the economy, said a weaker franc over the past year had been a
key fact for stimulating growth. The French franc closed at FFr3.5290
against the D-Mark, down from FFr3.5120.
In the UK the spectre of inflation without growth was raised by the
announcement of rising inflationary pressures at the retail level and lower
than expected manufacturing output. The pound fell sharply against a strong
D-Mark - hitting DM2.4361 at one stage - and also against the dollar.
However, it was revived by a spurt of buying from the Middle East and
recovered from a low of Dollars 1.5195 to Dollars 1.5220. Against the German
currency, it closed at DM2.4420, slightly down on the day.
The dollar staged a brief rally early in the day as some dealers decided
that it had fallen far enough and they were picking up a bargain. It moved
back through DM1.60 to close at DM1.6035 against the D-Mark, up from
DM1.5960, but there was little volume to back up the rise. The market is
waiting for tomorrow's data on September retail sales and producer prices.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper controversy is spectre
at LME feast - Recriminations are continuing over the handling of this
year's supply 'squeeze'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON'S annual 'metals week' is under way, bringing nearly everyone who is
anyone in the metals business to the UK capital. And, not for the first
time, the London Metal Exchange, the institution they have come to pay
homage to, finds itself at the centre of controversy.
Unusual activity has kept its 'flagship' copper contract in turmoil for much
of this year. First prices slumped by one quarter in only five weeks,
culminating in a 5 1/2 -year low in May. Several trading houses suffered
huge losses - estimates range from Dollars 50m up to about USDollars 140m.
There were no corporate casualties but a number of individual traders,
including one reputed to have lost Dollars 14m in the copper price collapse,
are now seeking employment.
More recently there has been a severe supply 'squeeze'. Despite lacklustre
world economic conditions and LME copper stocks reaching a 15-year peak, the
copper price climbed steadily. There were accusations that the price was
being manipulated upwards by a clever use of options. Fingers pointed at
Sumitomo, the Japanese metals group, but Mr Yasuo Hamanaka, the senior
manager responsible for copper trading and often described as the most
powerful individual in the copper market, denied any manipulation was going
on. He said the acute supply tightness was highly technical and could be
traced back to the earlier sharp fall in prices.
The LME board issued two public warnings about the squeeze and some
arm-twisting went on behind the scenes, but all to no avail. So, at its
meeting on September 8, the board decided to take emergency action 'in
anticipated of the development of an undesirable situation in the copper
market', and limited the daily backwardation (premium over the future price
for metal for immediate delivery).
Since then the squeeze has disappeared and the copper price has dropped
sharply. It is far from clear what happened - and those who know are not
telling. Some suggest that a big deal was done against the high copper price
and so there was no longer any reason to continue the squeeze. Other rumours
suggest that the banks financing those behind the squeeze became concerned
after the LME board took action and refused to continue to provide the
necessary credit. There are even suspicions that the squeezers and those
being squeezed got together to work out a compromise arrangement after the
board's action.
Meanwhile, the LME board is in a classic 'no win' situation. It was widely
condemned for allowing the copper price to be manipulated upwards. Now it is
being criticised for interfering in the market and, in particular, for using
a method that apparently favoured those who were short of copper (had sold
metal they did not own in the expectation of being able to buy it later at a
lower price).
All this is of more than academic interest.
Apart from being in London to pay homage to the LME, metals producers and
consumers are starting their 'mating season', the endearing term used to
describe the start of annual contract negotiations. At least half the
contracts covering the six metals traded on the LME will be related directly
to LME prices.
There has been growing concern that in recent years the behaviour of the LME
copper price has tended to become increasingly divorced from the perceived
levels of physical supply and demand.
Mr Martin Thompson, commercial adviser at RTZ, the world's biggest mining
group, suggests the main cause is that the growth of the copper market,
which is restricted to growth in copper consumption, 'has fallen far behind
the growth in finance available to some market operators, whose capacity to
influence the price has grown accordingly.
'Restriction on the supply of metal - attributed to a Japanese company  -
did much to support copper's price in 1991,' he writes in Mining Journal's
annual review. 'Heavy buying by Chinese companies, well beyond their
physical purchases, performed the same service in 1992 and early this year.
Operations by American commodity funds have also been influential from time
to time.
'In addition, the volume of options now sold is such that covering by their
sellers, by both buying and selling, has become a major 'rogue' element in
the market.'
Mr Raj Bagri, the LME's chairman suggested this week, in a spirited defence
of his board's copper market intervention, that mobility in international
money markets and a massive increase in options and other derivatives
activity 'makes it comparatively easy or tempting for one or more
participants, individually or acting in concert, to create in any free
market like ours such dominant positions so as to result in potentially
undesirable situations or practices'.
'We must be vigilant,' he said, 'and ready to deal with such situations as
and when the need arises.'
Speaking at the LME's annual dinner on Tuesday, Mr Bagri insisted that the
board believed in free markets. 'But we also have a duty and obligation to
run an orderly market and we are determined that the confidence reposed by
the overwhelming majority of the metals trade and industry around the world
in our reference prices continues to be justified and that these prices
continue to be transparently and independently established without
unwarranted distortions,' he declared.
Mr David King, the LME's chief executive, points out that at least 80 per
cent of the exchange's business is from metals processors and consumers.
Less than 1 per cent of LME turnover is from commodity fund activity
compared with 25 to 40 per cent on the New York Commodity Exchange.
Admittedly banks are financing Dollars 4bn of LME stocks at present but
'this is mainly on behalf of producers and consumers.'
Despite the criticisms, the LME is obviously doing something right. For the
past four years business in tonnage terms has been increasing at an annual
average rate of 30 per cent. Despite low metals prices, turnover this year
will reach about USDollars 1,000bn, compared with Dollars 700bn in 1992.
This still leaves the LME trailing well behind the big US commodity
exchanges but it is different from them because 4 per cent of its contracts
actually result in physical metal being delivered, much more than any other
exchange.
Mr King says the LME has three 'pillars': attractive hedging facilities; an
extensive warehouse network, mainly in consuming areas, for physical
delivery; and a reference price. 'All these must work well because that is
what the customers want.'
There is still some work to be done on the warehouse network even though
there are now nearly 400 authorised to stock nearly 500 LME-approved brands
sourced from about 60 countries. At present only aluminium is delivered to
those in Japan while copper is excluded from those in the US.
'Eventually copper and other metals will go into Japanese warehouses and
copper will go into US ones - but only when the time is right,' says Mr
King. 'At the moment the industries in those countries are not supportive.'
The LME is also looking at the potential for warehouses in the 'tiger'
states of the Far East, an area of fast economic growth. Thailand, South
Korea and Taiwan are all possible locations.
Mr King says the LME is also keeping a wary eye on the potential merger
between the New York Mercantile Exchange and the New York Commodity
Exchange, which also has a copper contract. 'Nymex has big resources and
trades precious metals, so a merger represents additional competition. And
any Comex merger would force us to step up LME marketing in the US - that
market has so much growth potential,' he says.
While the threat of a competitive metals exchange being set up in Japan has
subsided, Mr King suggests the LME must be wary about Germany. 'Germany
wants to be more involved in financial activities of all types and it might
be on the agenda there,' he says. 'It is the main European consumer of
metals and it has the resources.'
Many other exchanges have 'gone electronic' but the LME will retain its
present system where ring-dealing members shout themselves hoarse at 'open
outcry' sessions several times a day.
Mr King says the LME's way of trading cannot be put on screen without too
many sacrifices - there are too many 'prompt' dates. In any case: 'Without
the open outcry system you miss the body language, the expressions on faces,
the way dealers say things. Screens can't provide this information'.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC 'green' currency proposal
may not satisfy Germans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission yesterday approved plans to adjust its 'green money'
rules, although it was not clear whether by enough to appease Germany, which
is demanding protection for its farmers against income losses that would
result from further rises in the D-Mark.
Brussels wants to widen the margins of currency fluctuation within which the
'green' rates at which EC farm price supports are translated into national
currencies are not changed. This would render revaluations of other green
currencies at the expense of German farmers less likely.
Extra EC pay-outs, moreover, would only be made after the green currency for
which adjustment was sought had been down by a sufficient amount for 12
months, although the member state seeking the farm price increase could pay
out an advance to its farmers, but out of national funds.
All changes in the green money grid have been frozen for the past five weeks
as a sop to Germany. Previously they were triggered when the weakest and
strongest currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism drifted apart
from their central rates by an aggregate of over 4 per cent in total. That
total would now be 5 per cent under the commission proposal.
Through these modest adjustments, which will be laid before the EC council
of farm ministers next Monday in Luxembourg, Brussels is trying to resist
German pressure to restore the costly 'switchover' mechanism. Under this
arrangement farm prices in all member states would be lifted to follow the
rise of the strongest EC currencies.
The commission calculates that the turmoil in the exchange rate mechanism
from September last year to August 2 - when all currencies in the grid were
floated within wide bands - cost the already strained farm budget an extra
Ecu1.5bn (Pounds 1.16m) as a result of switchover.
Brussels estimates that restoration of switchover would cost an additional
Ecu1.6bn in 1994-98 for each 1 per cent revaluation Its own proposals, which
call for the member states to finance half of any green adjustments
nationally, would cost less than half this.
Germany's ability to apply pressure is constrained on two fronts:
First, if EC farm prices are re-linked to the D-Mark, this will erode the
nearly one third cereal price cut made in last year's reform of the Common
Agricultural Policy (CAP). Those price cuts are aimed at getting EC produce
prices down to world market levels after three years, and at minimising the
extent to which the EC will have to comply with the 21 per cent curb on
subsidised food exports over six years demanded as part of the EC/US Blair
House accord for the Uruguay Round farm chapter.
France still refuses to accept the Blair House agreement, but a return to
the 'switchover' mechanism would make their eventual acceptance of a Uruguay
Round deal involving farm trade even more difficult.
Second, east German cereals farmers have planted some 350,000 hectares more
than they are entitled to under the production restraints in the CAP reform,
an overshoot of nearly 10 per cent.
Bonn is seeking flexibility from Brussels given the parlous state of the
east German economy, and the commission will be seeking flexibility from
Germany in the agri-monetary dispute, officials say.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US maize estimate reduced still
further
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Department of Agriculture has reduced its estimate of the size of the
US maize harvest yet again.
The USDA's latest report, released on Tuesday night, forecast that the crop,
which suffered from late planting and the summer's record deluge, would be
about 6.96bn bushels, down 3.7 per cent from its September estimate. That
was the fourth such reduction in as many months.
If production does indeed fall below 7bn, it will the smallest US maize crop
since 1988, a drought year.
The magnitude of the reduction surprised grain traders, who responded by
buying maize futures at the Chicago Board of Trade on Wednesday morning. By
midsession, maize for December delivery was up 3 cents at Dollars 2.47 1/4 a
bushel.
The short harvest, however, poses no risk to grain supplies, or even of food
price inflation, as much of 1992's record crop is still in storage. Mr David
Miller, analyst with the American Farm Bureau, estimated yesterday that
there would be 1.1b bushels of US maize still in storage after all domestic
use and export demand is accounted for.
'Carryout stocks will be more than adequate,' he said.
The USDA harvest estimate was based on an October 1 crop survey, when less
than 10 per cent of the nation's maize crop had been gathered. The smaller
forecast reflected cool September temperatures, which reduced yields in
Iowa, and damage from scattered early frosts in Minnesota and other northern
areas. Farmers with severely damaged crops are ploughing them under to
qualify for government payments, rather than attempting to harvest them.
The report also reduced the USDA's soyabean production estimate to 1.89bn
bushels from 1.91bn in September.
Copa, the European Community farmers' lobby has raised its forecast of the
1993 EC grain crop to 167.13m tonnes, down from 161m last month and the
169.47m it estimated for the 1992 harvest.
The EC grain trade lobby, Coceral, last week put the 1993 the community's
grain crop at 164.87m tonnes. It estimated the 1992 harvest at 168.47m.
Copa's higher 1993 estimate mainly reflected a higher maize figure of 30.44m
tonnes, against Coceral's 28.66m. The farmers' lobby also forecast a higher
1993 durum wheat crop of 6.93m tonnes, compared with Coceral's 6.15m.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold price holds on to gain
after New York surge

GOLD IN London yesterday held on to gains made in late trading in New York
on Tuesday and closed at USDollars 365.75, a troy ounce, up Dollars 5.60.
Traders said speculative buying by New York funds pushed gold through price
levels that generated 'buy' signals to some computerised investment
programmes.
'There was nothing in the way of new news to cause this reaction. It was
purely technical. There has been no change to the fundamental outlook for
gold,' said Mr Andy Smith, analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland.
He said that there was no follow-on buying in the Far East or Europe
yesterday after the surge in New York.
In his latest Gold Strike publication, Mr Graham Roberts, head of the mining
team at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, part of the Bank Indosuez Group, says it is
critical that physical demand for gold should return in response to lower
prices and seasonal strength 'if confidence in the gold market is to return
and the all important investment buying resumed.
'Equally, in a more cautious gold market, the ghosts of central bank sales
and producer forward selling have yet to be allayed.' Mr Roberts suggests
gold can be expected to trade in a range between Dollars 365 and Dollars 380
an ounce in the near term.
China's State Council has assigned the People's Bank of China and the
Economic and Trade Committee to start researching the establishment of a
national gold market, the China Gold News said, reports Reuter from Beijing.
It said that this was an important step toward gold products entering the
market and the gold industry moving from a planned to a market economy. The
paper, published by the Metallurgy Industry ministry, gave no more details.

FT  14 OCT 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Strength in demand for wool and gradually rising prices in recent weeks are
leading to more confidence. Clearances in Australia were again very good at
this week's auctions, and price increases were particularly marked among
superfine merinos at Goulburn. This sector has been leading the market
upwards for some time and stockpile availability is limited. There is a
widening view that the lowest point might have been passed in wool's long
and painful recession, and that stockpile disposal fears may have been
overdone. The AWC market indicator was 455 cents a kg on October 13, from
442 cents a week before.

Persistent but unconfirmed talk of European production cuts helped the push
ZINC prices sharply higher at the London Metal Exchange yesterday. The three
months price was quoted at Dollars 968.50 at the close, up Dollars 38.75 on
the day, and moved further ahead to Dollars 976 in after hours trading.
Dealers said the trend was also aided by investment funds covering what were
believed to be substantial short positions. News of a smelter closure helped
LEAD prices to add to Tuesday's strong gains, but after resistance was
encountered around Dollars 420 a tonne for three months metal the price
retreated to Dollars 414.50 at the close, just Dollars 1 higher on balance.
London cocoa appeared happy to remain positive this afternoon but without
real conviction while coffee steadied after a weaker morning but seemed
unsure of its next move. London COCOA futures held on to most of their early
gains, with the March position ending Pounds 9 higher at Pounds 945 a tonne.
But dealers said the rise lacked real conviction. The COFFEE market steadied
after a weaker morning but seemed unsure of its next move.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tough times ahead for copper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COPPER market has a 'rough patch' immediately ahead, according to Mr
Douglas Yearley, chairman of Phelps Dodge of the US, the world's
second-largest copper producer, writes Kenneth Gooding, Mining
Correspondent. Weakness in demand from Europe and Japan had forced the group
to revise its forecasts, he said in London.
Phelps now expected a copper supply surplus of 200,000 tonnes this year,
compared with a previously-forecast 150,000 tonnes. Mr Yearley said there
might even be a surplus in 1994 whereas his company earlier this year
expected a deficit.
Consequently, the copper price would probably trade in a range between 70
cents a lb (Dollars 1,543 a tonne) and 85 cents (Dollars 1,873 a tonne). The
sharp fall in the price in April was 'a wake-up call' to the industry, which
it should still heed despite a slight recovery since then.
However, once recovery arrived - whenever that might be - demand for copper
might grow by 10 per cent to 15 per cent in only two years as it made up for
recent minimal growth, said Mr Yearley. 'That gives a lot of upside (for the
price) and not a lot of downside.'
On average annual copper demand could be expected to increase by 2 to 2.5
per cent, requiring at least an extra 200,000 tonnes of the metal a year.
Also 50,000 to 100,000 tonnes of capacity was disappearing each year as
mines became depleted.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Accountancy Column: Balancing rules and professional
judgment - Dennis R. Beresford looks at the lessons the UK should derive
from US experience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DENNIS R. BERESFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On August 20, the Accountancy Column's subheading stated: 'Roger Davis
argues that professional experience and instinct should count for more than
rigid adherence to the rule book.' I submit that accounting standards and
professional judgment must be more like equal partners. And that companies
as well as auditors must supply this judgment.
In the US we have tried both general principles and much more detailed
standards. Most business people and senior partners of audit firms support
the former in theory but ask for the latter in practice. This is for some of
the same reasons mentioned by Mr Davis: the threat of litigation and
increasing competition in the audit business. But there are other reasons as
well.
One key factor is that business has become much more complex. Actions taken
by companies to sell their products internationally, protect against a
multitude of financial and other risks, adjust to new technology, and other
developments often raise new accounting issues. Professional judgment and
common sense can guide the accounting for many of these issues.
Nevertheless, most agree that financial reporting is not useful unless there
is a reasonable degree of comparability from company to company. Can readers
of financial statements place much credibility in those statements if
company A decides that an expenditure is an asset and company B decides the
same expenditure is a current period expense? When these transactions relate
to significant items that affect a wide range of companies some
standardisation is essential.
A good illustration is the current debate at the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) on accounting for hedging transactions. Many
companies have entered into contracts designed to reduce their exposure to
commodity, foreign currency exchange, or interest rate risks.
A loss may occur on such a contract that the company expects will be offset
by increased profit on a future sale or other transaction. Under what
circumstances, if any, should that loss be considered an asset? This is the
kind of issue that I believe needs careful consideration by standard
setters. A common approach is likely to result in more useful financial
reporting.
As another example, consider the 'simple' case of accounting for business
combinations. How should common sense and professional instinct, as Mr Davis
puts it, apply to questions such as:
Why should some combinations be accounted for as acquisitions and others as
mergers?
What future costs should qualify as liabilities in recording an acquisition?
Should any excess purchase price (goodwill) be charged to reserves or
capitalised and amortised?
I submit that these types of pervasive questions are best addressed overall
by standard setters rather than case by case. The alternative is chaos in
financial reporting where the best individual judgments cannot possibly
compensate for lack of reasonable uniformity in the basic reporting model.
At the same time, the standards must recognise limitations and leave room
for application of judgment. For example, a standard might provide general
guidance on the future costs that qualify for liability treatment in an
acquisition. But the company and its auditor must exercise considerable
judgment in deciding which future events actually qualify for such
treatment.
There is a temptation for standard setters, encouraged by questions from
auditors and company representatives, to go overboard and pursue uniformity
past the point of diminishing returns. The FASB has sometimes erred in that
direction. The result is rules that only a specialist can interpret, and
accounting that loses sight of the objective of meaningful reporting. As Mr
Davis puts it: 'The avoidance industry will find the loopholes, and the
inevitable consequence being yet more rules.' I agree that we must avoid
that vicious circle.
Striking an appropriate balance between accounting standards and application
judgment is not a new phenomenon. For many decades at least, companies and
their auditors have had to determine the amounts of allowances for losses on
receivables, inventory obsolescence, impairment of operating assets, and
countless other amounts in the financial statements. A general accounting
standard underlies each of these items but appropriate professional judgment
still is critical to the resulting reports being 'fairly presented', as we
put it in the US.
Another point alluded to by Mr Davis is the length of recent standards.
While his reference was to the UK, it also describes the American situation
very well. But it is important to analyse the sheer size. Most of our US
standards, and increasingly those in other countries, use the bulk of the
document to explain why we have done something.
A 'basis for conclusions' describes our reasoning, including our responses
to arguments raised during the public comment process. Our documents also
often include illustrations and other guidance to make them more
user-friendly. A relatively short standard accompanied by reasoning and
illustrations seems to be what companies and auditors find most useful.
As mentioned earlier, both the threat of litigation and increasing audit
competition have contributed to requests for more standards. Unfortunately,
we have seen too many situations in which the auditor is told: 'I plan to
follow this accounting unless you show me a rule that says I can't' One
response to this would be what Mr Davis calls this 'sticking to what your
guts tell you'. But that does not assure that the accounting will be
appropriate, particularly for emerging issues.
For these new developments, the FASB's constituents recommended that an
emerging issues task force could assist. Similar efforts were started later
in Canada and the UK. These efforts rely heavily on practicing auditors and
company financial officers to resolve issues before they become bigger
problems.
Interestingly, a large number of the matters dealt with by this group in the
US have involved broad principles where professional judgment results in too
wide a range of reported outcomes. Regulators, the audit firms themselves,
or others insisted on more objective sidelines to narrow the application of
judgment.
In summary, accounting standards and professional judgment in their
application must co-exist if the art of financial reporting is to remain
relevant. Finding the right balance, not overly emphasising one or the
other, is our challenge.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Survey of International Standards (5): Gulf of
misunderstanding - Frank McGurty sorts out some of the confusion in the US
system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT FIRST glance, the American system for setting industrial and commercial
standards is intimidating.
In contrast with the UK, where a single body - the British Standards
Institution - has a monopoly over standard writing, there are some 450
separate groups, from the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers
to the American Dental Association, involved in making the rules and
specifications to be followed by companies doing business in the US.
Many outsiders view the system as confusing. Some are suspicious of the
inability or reluctance of American industry to streamline what is by any
measure a highly fragmented process. They believe the system's centre of
gravity - the American National Standards Institute - needs to be
strengthened to bring more coherence to the system.
'There is a gulf of understanding between the two sides of the Atlantic over
the role of standards,' admits Mr Stephen Cooney, a senior policy director
at the National Association of Manufacturers, an umbrella organisation
representing the interests of US industry.
Mr Cooney believes Europeans have historically viewed standards as a barrier
to trade. Indeed, standard-setting within the EC has proved a pivotal issue
in negotiations leading to the establishment of the single European market.
This perspective has flavoured attitudes towards the US process.
In contrast, he says, American companies generally have a more trusting
attitude towards the enterprise of standard setting, long considered an
essential ingredient in fostering inter-state commerce. A bicycle
manufacturer in Brunswick, Maine, to take one example, can feel confident
buying frames from a Pasadena, California, manufacturer because the American
Welding Society has established about 100 standards for metal welds.
Most of those involved with the business of standard development agree that
the reason the US system has won such broad support is its voluntary,
self-regulatory approach. Market forces, rather than government oversight,
are usually the catalyst for an industry to establish a new standard.
However, 'the hot breath of government regulators', as Mr Cooney points out,
sometimes spurs the private sector into action.
Mr George Willingmyre, vice-president of ANSI, which represents the US in
international standards organisations, describes the process as
'complementary'. If government agencies, such as the Federal Drug
Administration or the Consumer Products Safety Commission, 'can meet their
mission by encouraging the marketplace to develop standards on their own,
they will do so'. Federal law requires the government to defer to any
voluntary standard if an acceptable one exists.
For the private sector, the development of standards on a voluntary basis
has some decided advantages. It allows industry to play a dominant role in
shaping the standard as well as in revising it to reflect subsequent changes
in technology and market conditions.
This bottom-to-top orientation is typified by the work of the American
Society of Mechanical Engineers, one of the most active of the standard
writing bodies in the US.
At the end of the last century, the ASME set the system's guiding precedent
in response to growing concern over the safety of heating boilers, which
were exploding at the rate of 1,000 a year. A voluntary committee, with
representatives of the industry, was convened to develop a criteria for the
accreditation of manufacturers. The ASME standard is now recognised in about
80 countries.
Since then, ASME committees in a range of engineering fields have been
engaged in developing two other types of standards. The first include
performance test codes - that is, determining how a product such a
compressor should perform, and drawing up criteria on design, manufacture
and testing to ensure that the product meets the specified level of
performance. The second category is dimensional standards for fasteners,
machine threads and the like.
The hallmark of the system, its advocates claim, is its openness. What is
known as 'a balance of communities', including manufacturers and users of
their products, is required. The intention is to prevent a standard from
becoming a tool for an industry's most powerful players to freeze out the
competition. The process must also allow ample opportunity of public review
and comment.
'Standards are set for public use, so the public has a right to be part of
the process,' says Mr Mel Greene, ASME's associate executive director.
ANSI, a privately funded, non-profit organisation, stands at the centre of
the process, though its presence is hardly imposing. It has no direct role
in setting standards, but instead sets the standards to which American
standard-setters are expected to conform. Its criteria relate to process
rather than substance. ANSI stipulates that a standard be developed under
the principles of balanced interests, consensus, public notice and rights of
appeal. The process must be 'open to all interested parties'.
If the method conforms to these rules, ANSI may then certify the result as
an 'American national standard' - which forms the basis for any product's
acceptance in the US market. Last year, 570 new national standards were
approved, bringing the total number in ANSI's register to almost 11,000.
ANSI's power to co-ordinate activities of the various standard setting
bodies, however, is less than absolute.
The institute's remit is to help a standard-setting body to determine if a
competing body is working on a parallel standard, or if one already exists.
However, some members of the standard-setting community believe that ANSI,
as a private-sector organisation with no official authority, can in effect
only minimise the overlap of its members' activities. It does this through a
series of standards boards - medical devices, construction and health and
safety and the like - to facilitate consultation among standard developers.
Dr Wallace Read, IEEE's vice-president for standards, says the relatively
passive role of ANSI sometimes results in unnecessary duplication by rival
standard setters, as well as excessive delays in implementing acceptable
standards.
But Mr Cooney of National Association of Manufacturers defends the US
approach. 'The system works well,' he insists, 'There is no need to make it
tight and neat' just because some are uncomfortable with its complexities.
None the less, he accepts that US industry must take a more international
approach to standard writing. In this regard, he points out, US standard
writers are increasingly looking for a complementary international standard
before formulating their own. Second, government-to-government efforts are
under way to improve the ability of foreign companies to test their products
against US national standards, and vice versa.

Accreditation. Sometimes confused with certification but in fact a procedure
for guaranteeing that the certification bodies themselves are up to scratch.
There may be many competing certification bodies in a particular field but
each country will normally have only one accreditation organisation. In the
UK this is the National Accreditation Council for Certification Bodies (3
Birdcage Walk, London SW1H 9JH. Tel 071 222 5374).
The growing demand for standards around the world and the large numbers of
certification bodies involved have prompted the spread of the idea of
accreditation.
CE Mark. This is probably best known to the public because it appears on the
packaging for toys but it is applicable to a wide range of products covered
by the 'new approach' directives.
In some cases manufacturers may apply the CE mark simply by declaring that
their product meets the required standards but other products require
independent certification that the standard has been reached. Toys may be
labelled on the basis of self-certification but in the UK at least, many
large retailers insist on independent certification.
CEN, the European Committee for Standardisation. CEN groups the national
standards bodies of the 12 European Community member states and the six
members of the European Free Trade Association. A further seven countries,
mainly from eastern Europe, have affiliate status.
CEN was established in 1961 but had little to do for its first 24 years
because standards setting was dominated by the national organisations and
ISO/IEC. But in 1985 the European Community instituted a new approach to
standard setting because it needed standards to back up the directives it
was starting to produce for its single market initiative.
CEN attempts to avoid duplicating the work of other organisations, so where
possible its standards are based on national or international ones. They
carry the EN - Euro-norms - prefix. Address: Rue de Stassart 36, B-1050
Brussels, Belgium. Tel 322 519 6811.
In common with ISO, CEN has no responsibility for the electrical industry.
This is handled by CENELEC, the European Committee for Electrotechnical
Standardisation, (rue de Stassart 35, B-1050 Brussels. Tel 322 519 6871)
while telecommunications standards are dealt with by ETSI, the European
Telecommunications Standards Institute.
Certification. The process of guaranteeing that a product or service
conforms to the requirements of the relevant standard or technical
specification. The product or company may then carry the 'tamp' of the
certification body. For example, in the UK, this may involve the 'kitemark'
of the British Standards Institution (2 Park Street, London W1A 2BS. Tel 071
629 9000).
Third party certification - by an independent organisation - allows a
supplier to demonstrate to his potential customers that he meets certain
standards.
European Organisation for Testing and Certification (EOTC). Set up in
December 1992 following a two-year pilot to establish the mutual recognition
by certification and testing organisations in Europe of each other's work.
The EOTC also includes in its aims the influencing of European policy on
technical trade barriers and on the development and harmonisation of
standards. Its membership comprises the standards organisations from 16
countries and 12 pan-European standards, consumer and industry associations.
It has established three committees to look at mutual recognition in the
fields of information technology, electrical products and water supply.
Address: Egmont House, rue d'Egmontstraat 15, B-1050 Brussels. Tel 322 502
4141.
ISO, the International Organisation for Standardisation. Set up in 1947, the
ISO is a federation of 92 member countries which appoint committees to
establish international standards. More than 8,600 international standards,
bearing the ISO prefix, have been created.
Responsibility for heading each standards committee is allocated to a
country with experience in that area, with the result that seven members
carry out 90 per cent of the work. Germany leads with 24 per cent of
standards, Britain with 23 per cent and France with 22 per cent.
If ISO creates a standard it takes precedence over national and European
standards. The only area where ISO is not active is in the electrical
industry. Electrical standards are the responsibility of the International
Electrotechnical Commission, set up in 1907.
Address: 1, rue de Varembe, PO Box 56, CH- 1211, Geneve 20, Switzerland.
Tel. 41 22 749 0111.
New approach directives. These represent a more flexible method of achieving
free trade within the European Community. They allow for directives which
lay down the mandatory requirements for assessing the safety of products but
which leave the detailed criteria to be set down in voluntary, harmonised
standards.
Before 1985 directives had, with one exception, included detailed annexes
setting out the technical requirements for the product. Keeping the annexes
up to date proved an unacceptable burden. The new approach directives were
based on the model of the 1973 Low Voltage Directive which was more
flexible.
New approach directives have been issued in fields such as toy safety,
electromagnetic compatibility, construction products, heart pacemakers and
gas appliances. Products meeting the criteria laid down in these directives
and their supporting standards may carry the CE mark.
Quality. In a general sense, quality, like beauty, is in the eye of the
beholder but in a trade context supplier and customer need to be talking an
agreed language. ISO9000, the international quality standard, is based on an
organisation's ability consistently to deliver a product or service that
satisfies its customers' requirements
The commitment to 'consistency' has prompted criticism that a company could
deliver a poor product but as long as it was consistently so it would still
comply with the requirements of ISO9000. In practice, defenders of the
standard argue, a company committed to the idea of quality would not wish to
interpret it in this minimalist way.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Survey of International Standards (2): BSI sails into choppy
seas - Charles Batchelor discusses the problems facing the UK organisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE British Standards Institution, the organisation which co-ordinates the
writing of UK standards, should be riding the crest of the wave. BS5750, the
quality assurance standard it devised in the late 1970s, has become a
world-wide best-seller and the basis for the European and international
quality standards.
Yet, just when the benefits of the hard work that went into BS5750 are
starting to pay off, BSI has run into choppy seas. The strains imposed by
its efforts to modernise its somewhat bureaucratic procedures cost it its
chief executive earlier this year.
And around the same time the government ordered a review of BSI, the grant
it receives from the public purse and the whole issue of standards writing
in the UK.
The government has yet to announce the results of its review but BSI is
pressing on with its own internal reorganisation. It is streamlining its
standards-writing division at the cost of 70 jobs and an annual saving of
Pounds 3m. Further cost savings and increased efficiency are expected from a
concentration of the organisation's London-based activities in new offices
in Chiswick, west London.
BSI is unusual for a standards organisation in that it not only co-ordinates
the writing of standards, it also has divisions involved in quality
assurance certification and product testing. Its German and French
counterparts, DIN and AFNOR, are engaged simply in standards-writing. BSI's
combination of activities produced profits of Pounds 7.5m last year on sales
of Pounds 74m. It employs 2,000 people.
Combining these three areas of activity gives BSI an undoubted marketing
advantage in the highly competitive fields of certification and testing,
though it stresses they are managed separately. More than 30 other
organisations are engaged in certifying companies to the BS5750 quality
standard while, according to some estimates, the UK has no fewer than 5,000
product-testing laboratories.
To ensure that the organisations which carry out certification and testing
are themselves up to scratch, the government established a National
Accreditation Council for Certification Bodies in 1984. If a certifier meets
the standards set, it can issue certificates bearing the tick and crown
symbol of the NACCB.
For reasons which have looked increasingly eccentric as competition between
the certification bodies has grown, the NACCB was set up under the BSI's
royal charter and is funded by BSI.
No-one has suggested that this curious arrangement limits the NACCB's
ability to treat BSI's certification activities any differently from those
of BSI's commercial rivals. But it does look odd and BSI itself is keen for
the NACCB to achieve complete independence.
Established in 1901 as the Engineering Standards Committee, BSI managed to
avoid the split between the electrical sector and the rest of industry which
has marked other standards organisations. The split arose because the
International Electrotechnical Committee was founded in 1907, 40 years
before the International Organisation for Standardisation, responsible for
all other industry areas, and the two never merged.
Other standards organisations which were subsequently set up, notably the
European organisations CEN and its electrical counterpart CENELEC, mirrored
this split.
One of BSI's first actions was to bring order to the manufacture of the
steel sections used to make tramway rails. Within a year of BSI introducing
a kitemark for tramway rails in 1903 the number of steel sections used had
fallen from 75 to five and industry was making savings of around Pounds 1m a
year.
BSI has since gone on to create standards in a wide range of industry areas
and now has some 12,000 standards covering anything from the fungal
resistance of wood panels and the strength and durability of fitted kitchens
to the impact resistance of cycling helmets.
Requests for standards come in from a variety of sources including
companies, the government, trade associations and consumer groups. If BSI is
convinced that there is a case for a new standard it puts together a
drafting committee made up of groups such as manufacturers, purchasers,
local authorities, government departments and consumers. These
representatives give their time free although the government has calculated
that the cost to industry of this activity is Pounds 200m a year.
BSI says it takes about two years to produce a British standard. It says
that this is faster than many of its international counterparts but it is
keen to speed up the process.
In spite of Britain's early lead in standards setting,quality slumped after
the second world war. When industry and government realised just how far
standards had slipped, there was a revival of interest and the creation, in
1979, of BS5750, which now accounts for just under half of BSI's turnover
and two thirds of profits.
Five years ago BSI embarked on a programme designed to modernise its
organisation, speed up the creation of standards and improve its
profitability.
As an institution incorporated by Royal Charter, it had not had a strong
commercial drive and had become somewhat bureaucratic in its attitudes.
It created the post of chief executive and appointed Mr Michael Sanderson,
formerly managing director at AWD Bedford Trucks, to the job. But after only
18 months Mr Sanderson resigned in June 1993 following what BSI called 'a
deep disagreement with the board on important matters of policy and
management'.
Day-to-day management has been taken over by a three-man board committee
headed by Mr Vivian Thomas, non-executive chairman. Not long after Mr
Sanderson's departure, though the two events were not connected, Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, announced a government review of
BSI. Mr Heseltine has called into question whether an organisation which now
makes a sizeable profit needs an annual government subsidy of Pounds 4.5m.
The government also wants to know what contribution standards make to the
competitiveness of British industry and what BSI's role should be now that
European and international standards are becoming more important than purely
national ones.
BSI believes that its work justifies continued public sector backing. But
the pressures on the government to reduce public spending are such as to
make reducing or removing the subsidy extremely attractive. BSI's efforts to
become more commercial could prove to be very timely.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Survey of International Standards (3): Where entente
cordiale reigns - European co-operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNLIKE other, higher profile, issues over which the UK and the rest of the
European Community have been at odds, standards is one corner where both
sides are positively effusive about each other.
They insist they are both vital to the users of standards with their joint
future secured by the premium that industry places on flexibility and the
need for consensus in drawing up standards.
At the European level, most standards are set by CEN, the European Committee
for Standardisation, while electrical products and telecommunications have
their own organisations - CENELEC and ETSI.
CEN groups the national standards bodies of the 12 European Community member
countries and the six members of the European Free Trade Association. A
further seven countries, mainly from eastern Europe have affiliate status,
with the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic currently applying for
affiliation. The committee attempts to avoid duplicating the work of other
organisations, so where possible its standards are based on national or
international ones. They carry the EN (European Standard) prefix.
The British Standards Institute is at such pains to stress its enthusiasm
for its European counterparts that its literature starts with an apology for
its name: 'BSI might easily be imagined as a bastion of insular nationalism.
Perish the thought. Standards are as international as the markets they
serve, and BSI's outlook has always been towards world markets to promote
the acceptability of the UK exports and imports on which we depend.'
The BSI Kitemark is perhaps the most widely known UK seal of approval and is
awarded, or licensed, by BSI to companies which produce goods to accepted
national or international standards.
Both BSI and CEN dismiss worries that one side may be redundant in the
three-tiered global standards structure which has bodies at the national,
European and international level.
Relations are so cordial that BSI says its London headquarters can be
regarded as the offices of their European counterparts and the UK is often
at the forefront of demands for new standards from Europe.
'The UK has got the image of being a slightly reluctant European, but in
terms of standards we are not. The UK is the quickest to establish European
standards as part of the national standards framework. The UK consistently
tops the league in this,' says Ms Patricia O'Rourke, BSI's senior press
officer.
The UK's desire for European standards is not born out of idealistic
Euro-enthusiasm: 'The feeling is that if you don't get involved, somebody
else is going to set the standard, set the agenda,' she adds.
The role of the European committees has been vastly expanded by the spate of
directives produced to establish the community's internal market initiative,
many of which use standards to spell out their requirements.
The community has been trying to reduce technical barriers to trade since
1969 but the attempt initially foundered in a bog of technical details which
had to be constantly updated.
In 1973, the Low Voltage directive took a different approach which limited
legislative harmonisation to essential requirements published in the
directive and then entrusted the preparation of supporting technical
specifications to standards organisations.
This new approach was adopted by the Community in 1985 and these days most
directives for goods and services are produced in this way.
With legislative differences outlawed by directives, considerable scope
exists for the voluntary harmonisation. This is essentially a marketing
challenge to suppliers to influence, but ultimately to meet, the preferences
of 'home' customers throughout the community without legal hindrance.
Yet at first glance, the European level looks the most vulnerable to
redundancy.
Ms O'Rourke says the need for European standards, however, is driven by
pragmatism and the community's special need for standards to support its
single market: 'I think it is a question of scale and timing. When you are
creating a national standard, we get all the interested bodies together.
'This can mean as many as 30 or 40 bodies represented on a committee. We
even had one committee of 60. When you have a European level you have all
the European countries involved and you have got to come to a consensus.
'When you are working on an international level you have more people
involved and it takes longer to produce.'
BSI says it takes an average of two years to produce a UK standard, four
years in Europe and more than six years internationally.
She adds: 'Also the EC has its own timetable of standards required by the
internal market.' She points to the electro-magnetic compatibility
directive.
This was implemented last year to ensure that electrical products do not
interfere with each other, heading off potential disasters such as
televisions interfering with life support machines in hospitals.
The directive relies on a number of standards to elaborate its requirements.
CEN says it enjoys a fruitful and productive relationship with all its
members, including BSI: 'Troubled though the UK's position in Europe may be
in certain respects, the European standards scene, which spans the Community
and other European trading agreements, has seen a huge shift towards
co-operation in drawing up standards to support directives and the UK is
playing its due proportionate part as one of the biggest member states,'
says Mr Stewart Sanson, head of information. 'These new approach directives
will typically contain the essential requirements for health and safety. All
the rest of things can be handled by voluntary standardisation and
verification.'
CEN, which was set up in 1961, admits it was a far smaller operation before
1985: 'The work was not very big. But in fact there was significant work
going on, with European standards for safety of lifts and safety of toys.
'Standards were created in the low hundreds. It was just an extremely small
secretariat of about 10 people,' says Mr Sanson.
He also points to the need for a European standard setter to achieve
consensus more quickly than at the international level, but argues that in
the end industry will decide where the appropriate standards should be set:
'International consensus is sometimes particularly difficult to achieve with
more than 130 countries.
'Other parts of the world have more technical differences than exist between
European countries; for example, in the US voltage is very different.'
He says CEN members have a much stricter attitude to the adoption of
standards: 'If the standard is voted for by CEN it has to be adopted and
implemented as a national standard. Countries in the rest of the world do
not have to adopt global standards.'

FT  14 OCT 93 / Survey of International Standards (1): A pervasive influence
 -Industry and the consumer both have an interest in the development of
internationally recognised standards. In this special survey, which
coincides with the 24th annual International Standards Day, Charles
Batchelor reports on progress
</HEADLINE>

STANDARDS, and the international agreements that underpin them, have a
pervasive influence on our daily lives. They help determine the shape and
size of our credit cards, the symbols on the dashboard of our cars, the
speed codes for the films in our cameras and the paper sizes we use at the
office.
No less important for the industrial or commercial user is the international
system for grading screw threads, the agreement on a standardised size for
freight containers and a common format for the numeric representation of
dates and times.
The absence of an international, or even a European, standard for electric
plugs and sockets, is one of the most obvious failures of the standards
industry. A study has finally begun into finding at least a Europe-wide
answer to a cause of constant annoyance for the international traveller, and
of cost to manufacturers.
Yet, in spite of its powerful impact on our lives and the economies of
nations, the standards world remains a curiously low key one. The reason is
not far to seek. Creating standards is the humdrum task of armies of
committees around the world. Much of their time is spent debating almost
imperceptible tolerances of machinery and systems of little interest to the
non-specialist.
The picture is made no clearer by the range of overlapping national,
European and international bodies involved and the pea-soup of acronyms used
to label the organisations and the standards they produce.
In Britain, for example, the British Standards Institution, co-ordinates the
writing of new standards. At the European level most standards are set by
CEN, the European Commission for Standardisation, although electrical
products and telecommunications have their own organisations.
International standards, in turn, are set by the Geneva-based International
Organisation for Standardisation (ISO). Once again, however, electrical
products are the responsibility of another body, the International
Electrotechnical Commission.
These overlapping organisations result in the same standard appearing in
many different guises. BS5750, a British quality assurance standard, has
been adopted internationally as ISO9000 and in continental Europe as
EN29000.
Despite the barriers thrown up by the bureaucratic nature of much standards
work, there are signs that neglect is making way for a period of closer
public interest. This interest is fuelled by a number of important factors:
The growing importance of regional trading blocks which require harmonised
standards if industry is to benefit fully from the removal of internal
barriers. The formal launch of the single European market last January gave
an added impetus to the move towards harmonised European standards which had
been under way since the early 1980s.
The creation of the North American Free Trade Area has similarly given
additional urgency to the search for harmonised standards and is prompting
closer working between Canadian, Mexican and US organisations.
The ultimate aim of industry and the standards writers is to create
international standards. Pressure from third world countries, no less than
from the industrialised world, is for standards which will get their
products into all the world's markets.
But the range of conflicting interests - manufacturers, consumers,
regulators - which have to be reconciled to create truly international
standards mean that national standards may initially be replaced by regional
standards.
A growing awareness of the economic advantage which can be won by ensuring
that your national standard forms the basis for an international standard.
Britain, France and Germany each head about one third of the ISO committees
set up to establish new international standards, a position which allows a
considerable influence on the shape of the ultimate standard.
The Canadian Standards Association felt it had achieved a sizeable benefit
when it was allocated the secretariat of a new ISO committee to write
environmental standards.
A move to the writing of what are sometimes known as horizontal standards,
covering such areas as quality assurance and environmental management.
ISO9000, the first such standard, has provoked much controversy.
Some parts of US industry fear that ISO9000 will be used to buttress
fortress Europe, while countries such as Germany, where more reliance is
placed on product testing, are suspicious of the value of monitoring
procedures. Horizontal or systems standards, applicable across broad swathes
of industry, are more wide-ranging in their impact than standards applicable
to a single product or industry.
The most significant impetus for harmonised standards has come from Europe
in recent years, largely due to the fact that the fragmented European market
place has had most to benefit. The US and Japan, with their larger,
homogenous home markets had less need to join the move to greater
harmonisation.
But if Europe continues to dominate the creation of international standards
through ISO, the US and Japan could start to come under pressure. ISO9000 is
starting to make inroads into the US market, complementing and even possibly
usurping manufacturers' quality assurance standards. With more than 400
industry-based standards bodies resulting in a highly fragmented sector, the
US is at a disadvantage in international standards making.
Not that Europe's move to greater harmonisation is without its problems. The
harmonised product directives which began emerging from the European
Commission in the late 1980s have prompted a veritable frenzy of standards
making. The directive covering personal protective equipment - head, eye and
foot protectors and the like - is expected to require 200 harmonised
standards, the construction products directive no fewer than 2,000 new
standards.
The so-called new approach directives give greater flexibility than their
predecessors, which laid down detailed technical requirements. But they do
require a welter of standards-making to back them up. Some of those involved
fear that the scale of the work involved is leading to a decline in the
quality of the standards which are being written.
'Standards are being rushed through. They are poorly drafted and open to
misinterpretation,' commented one participant in the standards-writing
process.
Nor is industry entirely happy with every aspect of the new directives and
their supporting standards. The certification and testing bodies in the
different countries - the public and private organisations and laboratories
which confirm that a particular standard has been met - frequently differ in
their interpretation of a standard.
To overcome this problem the European Organisation for Testing and
Certification was set up in January 1993. The EOTC has already established
groups in the fields of electrical products, information technology and
water supply to ensure that testing laboratories and certification bodies
recognise each others' work and more than a dozen other groups are being
established.
Even so, companies with an established product range and a good safety
record frequently find the new directives unduly complex, bureaucratic and
costly to conform to, according to Mr Mo Masri of SGS, a large testing and
certification company.
Introducing standards into a new area, or modifying the existing standards
framework, can have a powerful knock-on effect on industry. Manufacturers
may be forced to modify their product ranges, cutting out marginal items
which do not justify the cost of testing or certification, and designing new
products to meet the standards. The European Toy Directive put a lot of toy
manufacturers out of business.
The standards industry also faces a considerable shake-up. There are an
estimated 10,000 independent testing laboratories in Europe as well as a
large number of certification organisations. The new EC directives are
creating more work in the short term but if the EOTC is successful in
promoting mutual recognition of test certificates then closures and mergers
are likely.
The pressure for standards, national, regional and international is
inexorable. The benefits to the consumer, industry and trade are
indisputable. But there is equally no doubt that the standards revolution
will claim its casualties. Standards have become another risk which
companies must learn to manage.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Government Bonds: Gilts show resilience to inflation data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and PATRICK HARVERSON

   LONDON, NEW YORK

UK GILTS surprised many with their resilience in the face of a
higher-than-expected September RPI figure. Longer-dated bonds dipped after
the release but recovered to end only slightly lower. The long gilt contract
slipped by  1/4 to close at 114 5/32 .
'I expected a bigger sell-off after these numbers,' said one senior trader.
Gilts were supported by heavy futures buying when the contract dipped below
114, he said. However, he warned that the market is vulnerable to further
setbacks in coming days.
Offsetting the inflation numbers and boosting the short end were weak
manufacturing output data, which fuelled hopes for a rate cut and spurred
domestic buying of maturities up to five years.
However, many retail investors stayed on the sidelines ahead of today's
economic releases, which include September jobs data, August average
earnings and manufacturing unit labour costs.
GERMAN government bonds wiped out early gains in late trading and the
December bund future closed at 99.98, down 0.04 points from Tuesday and off
its 100.15 intra-day high. The unchanged 6.70 per cent rate on the
Bundesbank's 14-day securities repurchase agreements disappointed some
traders, who had hoped it would edge slightly lower.
Bund futures were further pressured by late profit-taking and by banks
hedging their positions in the new government bunds. The government issued
DM4.11bn of 6 per cent bunds at 100.71 and above.
'People were so bullish they bid for the paper at the top of the market, but
they couldn't place it so they had to hedge,' said one London trader. The
bonds ended at 100.63 bid, yielding 5.91 per cent.
FRENCH bonds outperformed bunds, with the notional bond future hitting a
record high at 124.44 and closing at 124.32, up 0.14 points.
Boosting bonds but undermining the currency was talk that the Bank of France
may cut its repo rate at today's open-market operation.
BELGIAN bonds also ended the day higher, in spite of the Belgian franc's
weakness, which prompted intervention by the central bank.
The yield premium of Belgian bonds over bunds narrowed to 131 basis points,
from 134 on Tuesday.
US Treasuries eased in light turnover traders and investors focused on the
upcoming inflation numbers. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year
government bond was down  3/32 at 104 15/32 , yielding 5.924 per cent. At
the short end the two-year note was down  1/32 at 100 3/32 , to yield 3.808
per cent.
Rising gold prices had contributed to Tuesday's late declines, but yesterday
morning there was no evidence of further gains in precious metals, so
longer-dated securities opened modestly higher.
The market's attention was diverted by Congressional hearings into proposals
that the Federal Reserve's independence be curtailed and its 12 regional
presidents appointed by the President. Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman,
told a hearing that the proposals would undermine the bank's ability to
fight inflation.

BELFOX, the Belgian futures and options exchange, is preparing for
wide-ranging changes which it hopes will broaden the market's appeal.
Formal adoption of the new regulations is expected next month, according to
the exchange, which was launched two years ago.
'The aim is to be as attractive as possible and have more participants on
our market,' said Mr Willi Van Stappen, a Belfox manager, yesterday.
Belfox was hampered in its first year of trading by lack of size and by
persistent technical problems. However, it is now gradually introducing new
products, including an option on the Bel-20 index of leading Belgian shares,
and more options on individual stocks.
Its latest annual report said that Belfox aimed to become 'a fully-fledged
derivatives market' by the end of the year.
The changes should help bring Belfox into line with other European
derivatives markets.
At the moment, for example, only Belgian and Luxembourg brokers and credit
institutions are eligible to be brokers or market-makers on Belfox.
Following adoption of the new rules, foreign banks and brokers will be able
to participate in the market, without having to become clearing members of
Belfox.
The new regulations will also widen the definition of futures and options to
allow new products - for example, commodities futures - to be traded. The
system of fixed commission levels will be dropped, allowing clients, members
and intermediaries to negotiate fees.
Trading has picked up since last year, when a 'gentlemen's agreement'
between 15 institutions had to be put in place to encourage trade in Belgian
government bond futures. That agreement ended earlier this year, but trade
in the bond futures has been helped by the continued turmoil in European
currency markets.

FT  14 OCT 93 / International Bonds: Ecu sector gets a boost from the EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Community threw its weight behind the Ecu bond market yesterday
with the launch of its widely-expected Ecu1bn offering of seven-year
Eurobonds.
Mr Paul Goldschmidt, director at the EC's credit and investment division,
said the issue underlined the German constitutional court's ruling in favour
of the Maastricht treaty on European union. 'The EC is making a political
statement with this offering,' he said.
The other aim was to attract institutional investors who had avoided the Ecu
market after Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty in June 1992.
As a result, the bonds were generously priced to yield 12 basis points less
than the French government's 9 1/2 per cent Ecu-denominated OAT due 2000.
Once freed to trade they rose from a fixed re-offer price of 98.97 to 99.05,
to yield 14 basis points below the OAT.
The EC plans to raise an equivalent amount in D-Marks in the Eurobond market
before the end of the month. The Ecu2bn raised through both issues will make
up the second tranche of the EC's Ecu8bn lending programme to Italy.
Turkey is expected to go ahead with its Pounds 100m offering of 10-year
Eurobonds today, even though Moody's, the US credit rating agency, has
placed its long-term rating under review for possible downgrading. The
bonds, via SG Warburg, are likely to be priced to yield 230 basis points
over UK government bonds. Before the Moody's announcement, the market had
expected the spread to be close to 200 basis points.
Household Mortgage Corporation (HMC), the centralised mortgage lender, is
also expected to raise Pounds 100m through an offering of mortgage-backed
notes via CSFB. There will only be one tranche and the notes are likely to
have an average life of five years.
The yield on HMC's notes is expected to be well below the yield on NatWest's
Class A2 mortgage-backed notes issued at the end of September.
At launch, NatWest's notes yielded 40 basis points over three-month sterling
London interbank offered rate and the spread has since tightened to 37 1/2
basis points. The market expects the spread on HMC's notes to be in the low
30s.
CSFB is also arranging a Dollars 100m seven-year Eurobond issue with a put
option after five years for Trinidad &amp; Tobago. The offering is expected
tomorrow or Monday.

FT  14 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: Portugal plans broad changes
to withholding tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PORTUGAL is planning changes to its withholding tax, which has long
discouraged foreign investment in its bond market.
It hopes to introduce a system under which non-residents are refunded within
one day, effectively scrapping the withholding tax on foreigners. Investors
based in tax havens such as Luxembourg or the Cayman Islands are likely to
be excluded.
The system is expected to take effect in January.
Portugal levies a 20 per cent withholding tax on government bonds. While
there are a number of double-taxation treaties for non-residents, the
cumbersome and time-consuming reclaim procedure has led to an interest rate
premium on Portuguese bonds over other markets.
The reforms will apply to all non-residents, including investors in the US
and Japan, which have no double-taxation treaties with Portugal.
'This is part of the process of opening up of our capital markets to foreign
investors and of bringing conditions in line with international capital
markets generally,' said Mr Jose Braz, secretary of state for the Treasury.
The plans are contained in the 1994 budget, which goes before the cabinet
today. If agreed, it will be presented to parliament tomorrow.
The effective abolition of the withholding tax for non-residents 'will
remove one of the major deterrents to investment in Portuguese bonds', said
Mr Andrew Roberts, of UBS.
Long-dated Portuguese bonds jumped about 1 1/2 points on heavy foreign
buying in anticipation of the announcement. The 10 5/8 per cent 10-year
benchmark yielded 9.22 per cent late yesterday, down from 9.45 per cent on
Tuesday.
Portugal's bond market has undergone sweeping reforms over the past year in
an effort to boost liquidity and attract foreign buyers. It is estimated
that foreigners own some 5 per cent of the market, but the Treasury is said
to want to increase this share to between 25 per cent and 30 per cent.
Compared with other European bond markets, Portugal's is relatively small.
The five-year sector has some Es217bn of bonds outstanding, the seven-year
sector some Es129bn and the 10-year some Es78bn. The Treasury recently
shifted most of its issuance to long-dated paper, which is sold at regular
auctions.
Nevertheless, fundamental factors favour Portugal, with its stable political
situation, easing inflation and declining debt-to-GDP ratio. According to
OECD forecasts, that ratio is expected to drop to 4.3 per cent this year
from 5.1 per cent in 1992.
With the exception of South Africa, Portuguese long bonds offer the highest
nominal yields, which makes them attractive to investors, Mr Roberts pointed
out.

HKDollars 662m flotation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
YAOHAN International, holding company of the Hong Kong-based Japanese retail
group, yesterday announced it is to raise HKDollars 662.5m (USDollars 85.7m)
through a flotation on the Hong Kong stock market.
The company has a disappointing track record on earnings from its core
retail business, but profits have been boosted by property disposals.
Investors are expected to subscribe because of the group's long-term China
ambitions, and the impressive connections of its chairman, Mr Kazuo Wada.
Yaohan's board of directors includes the former chief executive of the Hong
Kong Stock Exchange and chairman of the Securities and Futures Commission,
in addition to the chairmen of Citic Australia and China Resources. This
demonstrates the level of business clout Mr Wada has achieved since he moved
headquarters to Hong Kong in 1990.
Yaohan International controls three listed companies in Hong Kong, which own
local department stores, restaurants and food processing operations, but it
will also be the primary vehicle for Mr Wada's push into China.
The company has a 36 per cent stake in a joint-venture department store
being constructed in Shanghai. The store will cost USDollars 100m to build,
and when complete in late 1995 will be the largest store in Asia.
The Chinese projects are all long-term, and the short-term outlook for
Yaohan International is less dynamic. In the year to March 1993, property
sales accounted for HKDollars 136m out of operating profit of HKDollars
264m.
In the current fiscal year, property profits of HKDollars 170m are already
locked in, and represent the bulk of earnings growth in a prospectus
forecast of HKDollars 265m.
Yaohan International is offering 247.2m new shares at HKDollars 2.68 a
share, representing 25 per cent of the enlarged share capital of the
company.

<TEXT>
TOWER Corporation, which claims to be the largest mutual insurance group in
New Zealand, is acquiring the Australian operations of the UK's Friends
Provident in an attempt to step up its presence in the Australian market.
No price was disclosed for the deal. However, Friends Provident Australia,
based in Sydney, has around ADollars 1bn (USDollars 661m) in assets and some
100,000 policyholders. Annual premium income is put at approximately
ADollars 120m to ADollars 130m.
The deal significantly expands Tower's Australian operations, based in
Melbourne. Mr James Boonzair, Tower's managing director, said the combined
Australian businesses would have about 140,000 policyholders, and assets of
ADollars 1.3bn. Tower Corporation, he added, had been seeking 'critical
mass' in Australia, and the merger should make a 'viable Australian
company'.
Friends Provident is owned by Eureko, the European financial services group
formed by four insurance businesses based in Scandinavia, the Netherlands
and the UK. Eureko said yesterday that Friends' Australian arm needed to be
larger, and required more local support than Eureko wished to provide.
The Amsterdam-based partnership added that, although the bulk of its
operations are based in Europe, there were no plans to dispose of the two
North American businesses - a life company based in Vancouver, and a medical
insurance operation in Indiana.

FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: Outokumpu unit sale raises
Dollars 129m

<TEXT>
OUTOKUMPU, the Finnish mining and metals group, has raised Dollars 129m from
the sale of OM Group, its US speciality chemicals unit.
It had been hoping to raise as much as Dollars 170m from the disposal, but
this was before poor market conditions forced it to postpone the sale,
planned for last April.
OM Group is being bought by US, European and Asian investors through a
public offering. The transaction has been underwritten by a group of US and
international investment banks led by Lehman Brothers, Donaldson Lufkin and
Jenrette and Goldman Sachs at Dollars 14 a share.
Outokumpu said earlier this year that OM Group was not a core business. The
disposal will strengthen its equity-to-assets ratio by 2.5 percentage points
to 23.5 per cent, taking it nearer its 30 per cent target.
OM Group's finances have been strengthened by a simultaneous primary issue
of shares, which raised Dollars 17m.
The unit, based in Cleveland, is one of the world's leading producers of
metal-based speciality chemicals, with manufacturing facilities in the US,
Finland and France. Sales in 1992 amounted to Dollars 201m and it has about
300 employees.

FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: Second-half improvement at Engen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN IMPROVED second-half performance helped Engen, the energy unit of South
Africa's Gencor mining group, lift net income by 13 per cent to R480m
(Dollars 139m) in the year to August, from R424m a year ago.
Earnings, which were in line with market expectations, were helped by the
higher volumes of crude oil processed at the Engen refinery in Durban
following the successful commissioning of a R600m expansion project. The
dividend was increased by 12 per cent to 154 cents per share, against 137.5
cents last time, on earnings of 309 cents per share compared with 275 cents.
The company was reluctant to offer a specific earnings forecast, saying it
depended on the economy recovering from recession and political stability.
With the benefits of the refinery upgrade now available for a full year,
however, they were optimistic that earnings should improve.
Turnover rose by 17.7 per cent to R7.7bn, from R6.6bn, due mainly to two
government-imposed rises in petrol prices during the year. There was no
volume growth in the domestic market.
Continuing benefits from overseas markets re-opening to South Africa in the
wake of political reform helped boost export volumes by 70 per cent. Engen
now exports to 26 countries, mostly in Africa. Margins on these sales are
considerably lower than in the domestic market.
Operating income rose by 47.1 per cent to R578m, but financing income fell
to R16m from R140m in 1992 as rights issue cash was spent. As a result,
pre-tax income was only 11.4 per cent higher at R594m (R533m).
A R115m programme to convert the livery of petrol stations to Engen from
Mobil (Engen was formed on the rump of the disinvesting Mobil in 1990) is
nearly complete and has boosted market share, which reached 25.8 per cent in
the gasoline market in the second half-year.

SHELL Forestry, a subsidiary of the international oil company, has sold its

of a rationalisation of its once substantial New Zealand forestry assets,
writes Terry Hall in Wellington.
Carter Holt Harvey, which is controlled by a consortium of US-based
International Paper and Brierley Investments, announced yesterday that it
was buying the half share of Baigent Industries that it did not already
control.
Carter Holt Harvey said that it was paying NZDollars 105m (USDollars 58m)

New Zealand-owned company.
Baigent owns 28,269 hectares of forests in South Island and a modern sawmill
which produces 140,000 cubic metres of timber a year. The company is
upgrading the mill at a cost of NZDollars 4m.

conditions

<TEXT>
BORAL, the Australian building products and energy group, yesterday waived
some the technical conditions attached to its ADollars 760m (USDollars 502m)
takeover bid for Sagasco Holdings, the Adelaide-based gas producer, but made
no change to the ADollars 3.50-a-share offer price, writes Nikki Tait.
The dropping of the conditions gives Boral additional flexibility in the
latter stages of the bid contest, although the predator has maintained the
key 50.1 per cent acceptance condition.
Sagasco has already rejected Boral's bid as inadequate. Much now depends on
what the South Australian government decides to do with its remaining 31.8
per cent interest in Sagasco. Boral already owns 19.9 per cent of Sagasco,
bought from the state government, and purchase of the remaining interest
would be sufficient to give Boral control of its target.

Seiyu, a supermarket chain which owns the Intercontinental Hotel group, saw
a 3.3 per cent decline in sales to Y529.3bn (Dollars 4.9bn) for the first
six months to August and a 15.6 per cent drop in operating profits to
Y12.4bn.
Cost cutting efforts and a decline in interest payments on borrowings helped
the company to post a 0.7 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y7.5bn.
After-tax profits fell Y19.5 per cent to Y4.3bn.
Mr Katsuhiro Fujiseki, president of Seiyu, said a full recovery in consumer
spending was unlikely before the second half of the next business year to
February 1995.
For the year to next February, the company expects pre-tax profits to rise
1.3 per cent to Y13bn on a 2.8 per cent fall in sales to Y1bn.
Family Mart, the country's third-largest convenience store operator and a
subsidiary of Seiyu, saw a 4.8 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y8bn.
After-tax profits fell Y3.6 per cent to Y3.9bn.
Operating profits dropped 5.6 per cent to Y7.3bn, the first year-on-year
decline, while sales at existing stores fell for the first time by 0.7 per
cent.
For the full year to February the company expects pre-tax profits to rise
0.6 per cent to Y17bn on a 4 per cent rise in sales to Y77.5bn.

KONE, the Finnish lifts and cranes group, yesterday blamed falling European
demand for its elevators as well as currency factors for a 16.6 per cent
drop in profits after financial items to FM201m (Dollars 35m) for the first
eight months.
Overall, sales were up 20 per cent at FM7.4bn, due to the weaker markka. The
rate of growth was slightly lower at Kone Elevators, which accounts for 71
per cent of sales, where turnover grew from FM4.5bn to FM5.3bn.
Lower European demand for new lifts and modernisation, particularly in
Finland, France and Italy, has pushed down the real value of the elevator
unit's orders by 5 per cent, in spite of growth in eastern Asia.

CIBA, the Swiss pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, reported an 8.3 per
cent upturn in sales in the third quarter to SFr5.2bn (Dollars 3.7bn), and
reiterated its forecast of an increase in net income for the full year.
Sales in all three divisions grew in the third quarter, in contrast to the
generally flat and lower trends in the first half. Part of the gains came
from the appreciation of foreign currencies, especially the US dollar,
against the Swiss franc.
The healthcare division, which accounts for nearly 40 per cent of group
turnover, reported a 13.9 per cent rise in sales in the quarter, to
SFr6.7bn.
Sales in the relatively small diagnostics and vision businesses were ahead
by 44 per cent and and 26 per cent respectively.
The core pharmaceutical business lifted sales 8.6 per cent to SFr1.6bn as
the effects of the US introduction last year of the Habitrol patch to help
people stop smoking waned.
Sales in the agricultural chemical division advanced 10.1 per cent to
SFr839m, fulfilling the group's expectations of a stronger second half in
the US and in the southern hemisphere.
The industrial businesses - mainly dyes, additives, pigments and polymers -
also recovered, with sales up 2 per cent in the quarter to SFr2.1bn.
For the nine months, group sales were flat at SFr17.1bn.

loans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MARUBENI, a leading Japanese trading house, will liquidate part of its
securities investment made during the late 1980s, writing off some Y23bn
(Dollars 217m) in extraordinary loans.
Many Japanese companies poured money into the stock market during the
economic 'bubble' of the late 1980s through tokkin, or specified money
trusts. However, most companies suffered heavy losses due to the plunge in
Japanese share prices in 1990.
The move comes amid increasing fears that Tokyo share prices will slip again
in the next few months. Sumitomo Corporation and Mitsubishi Corporation,
leading trading houses, recently wrote off investment losses incurred by
financial subsidiaries.
Such affiliates were set up as 'profit centres', and to act as a banker for
other subsidiaries, borrowing from banks and raising money on capital
markets, and passing on savings to smaller members of the group.

<TEXT>
FIRST Chicago reported a record profit of Dollars 284m for the third quarter
yesterday as the company rebounded strongly from the Dollars 372m loss
incurred in the same period last year.
The mid-western banking group, the 13th-largest in the US, fell deep into
the red in 1992 after it took a Dollars 625m special provision to cover
credit losses related to the disposal of problem property assets.
With the bulk of the asset disposal programme over, First Chicago attributed
its latest improvement to strong contributions from all its main business
lines, particularly proprietary trading and venture capital.
The bank reported earnings of Dollars 117m from its venture capital
business, from virtually nothing in the same quarter a year ago.
Earnings from the trading of primarily interest rate options, swaps and
foreign exchange totalled Dollars 77m, the second best quarterly trading
performance in the bank's history.
Non-interest income was also boosted by continued growth in First Chicago's
credit card business, where fee revenues rose to Dollars 186.7m, up from
Dollars 138.6m a year ago, as total managed receivables grew by 23 per cent
to Dollars 9.6bn.
Net interest income was Dollars 341m in the quarter, up from Dollars 294m in
the same period of 1992 as the bank's loan assets shrank 10 per cent to
Dollars 21.6bn.
The bank's shares rose Dollars  5/8 to close at Dollars 50 on the New York
Stock Exchange yesterday.

FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: Travelers hit by asbestos claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RISE in the number of environmental damage and asbestos-related claims has
forced Travelers, the US insurer, to add Dollars 325m to its
property-casualty reserves and take an after-tax charge of Dollars 211m in
its third quarter.
The addition to reserves and charge mean Travelers will record a net loss
for the July-September reporting period when it releases its results next
week.
The company, however, said its operating earnings will show an improvement
over the year.
Primerica Corporation, the financial services group which owns a 27 per cent
stake in Travelers and which agreed last month to a full merger with the
insurer, said yesterday the charge would have no impact on its third quarter
or full-year results.
Travelers said it has bolstered its asbestos and environmental litigation
reserves, which now stand at Dollars 670m, for three reasons: an increase in
the number of industry workers alleging they have been exposed to asbestos;
a rise in environmental claims made by smaller companies; and the naming of
Travelers as a defendant in insurance coverage cases brought by other
insurers against their policyholders and the policyholders' other carriers.
Investors took yesterday's announcement in their stride, and by the close
Travelers' share price was down Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 37 7/8 on the New
York Stock Exchange.

<TEXT>
WEYERHAEUSER, the US forest products group, yesterday said its third-quarter
earnings had fallen by 38 per cent, as a sharp decline in paper and pulp
prices offset a strong performance by its timber business.
largest private owner of softwood timber, linked its overall performance to
depressed conditions in the North American pulp and paper industry. In this
segment, profits were Dollars 2.5m, a sharp drop from last year's Dollars
61.2m.
Prices for most paper and pulp products had fallen about 20 per cent from
1992 levels, the company said. In addition, it had curtailed production
levels at some mills because of soft market conditions.
Net income for the 13 weeks to September 26 was Dollars 66.6m, or 32 cents a
share, compared with Dollars 107.2m, or 53 cents, in the third quarter of
1992, which was a period of robust growth for the company. Revenues slipped
5 per cent to Dollars 2.22bn, from Dollars 2.35bn a year earlier.
Excluding special factors, however, the decline in earnings was marginal.
The 1993 results included a charge of 10 cents a share to provide for
changes in the federal corporate tax rate enacted this summer.
Last year's figure, meanwhile, reflected a one-time gain of 8 cents a share
following the partial settlement of tax refund dispute.
Although the results were in line with most analysts' expectations, the
announcement was followed by a dip in Weyerhaeuser's shares. By the close in
New York, they were down Dollars 1/4 at Dollars 38 5/8.

FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: Bankers Trust sets up Dollars
12m Angola oil facility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKERS Trust has structured and arranged a Dollars 12m facility which
provides protection against fluctuations in the price of crude oil for
Sonangol UEE, Angola's national oil company.
Sonangol has already drawn about 10 per cent of the one-year facility, which
will finance the installation of a floating production, storage and
offloading vessel so that two previously-drilled oil wells can be brought on
stream.
Bankers Trust has provided a hedge for about 2m barrels of crude oil. Mr Ted
Giletti, managing director of Energy Merchant Bank, part of Bankers Trust,
said the hedging mechanism was necessary because of the size of the facility
relative to the projected oil flow rate. The two wells are situated in Block
4/26, an offshore oilfield off the coast of Angola.
Block 4/26 is expected to produce between 7,000 b/d and 9,000 b/d and
recoverable reserves are estimated at between 9m and 14m barrels.
Since the mid-1980s, Angola has become the second-largest oil producer in
sub-Sahara Africa, after Nigeria. Bankers Trust said that further
development programmes are expected to boost Angola's crude oil production
from current levels of 500,000 b/d to about 700,000 b/d by 1997.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors said it would begin testing the everyday use of its Impact
electric vehicles in a Dollars 32m nationwide programme in the US scheduled
for early 1994, Reuter reports from Los Angeles.
A total of 30 Impacts will be rotated on a two- to four-week basis among
1,000 participants in 12 regions. Drivers will use the cars in real-life
situations so that the company can gather data for the vehicle's eventual
sale, set for some time in the late 1990s.
Of the 1,000 participants, 300 will be in four California regions: Los
Angeles, San Diego, Sacramento and the San Francisco Bay area, GM said.
California has the toughest car emission control standards in the US.
Beginning in 1998, 2 per cent of cars sold in the state must be
zero-emission vehicles. That figure will rise to 5 per cent by 2001 and 10
per cent by 2003.
The Impact has a range of 70 miles in the city and 90 miles on the open road
at 55mph. According to GM studies, 68 per cent of people drive less than 50
miles a day.
The car uses lead-powered batteries, which take between two and three hours
to recharge if they are below 80 per cent of capacity.
The batteries have to be replaced every two to three years at an estimated
cost of between Dollars 2,000 and Dollars 5,000, which is comparable to the
maintenance costs of a petrol-powered car over the same period, GM said.

quarter

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CBS yesterday posted record earnings for the third quarter and forecast a
record full year.
Wall Street enthusiastically greeted the results from the company, which
entered the 1993-94 television season with the top-rated US broadcast
network. By the close of trading, the stock reached an all-time high of
Dollars 285 1/8 , a gain of Dollars 8 3/4 on the day.
For the three months to end-September, the group reported net income of
Dollars 118.3m, or Dollars 7.39 a share, which compared with Dollars 42.7m,
or Dollars 2.76, in the corresponding period of 1992.
The results included a one-time gain of about Dollars 3.20 a share,
reflecting the settlement of a legal dispute with Viacom International, the
US cable television group, as well as the conclusion of certain tax
proceedings.
The buoyant performance reflected the strength of the network's programming.
Last month's debut of Late Night starring Mr David Letterman, the popular
chat-show host, served to bolster CBS's already commanding lead over its
rivals in the battle for viewers.
As a result, the CBS television network realised a 15 per cent gain in
revenues and a substantial increase in operating profit, in spite of the
continued sluggishness of the US economy.
In addition to higher advertising pricing, the improvement was attributed to
the absence of last year's coverage of the US political party conventions,
which typically fail to attract big viewing audiences. Lower operating costs
at both the television and radio divisions were another contributing factor.
On a consolidated basis, CBS's net sales were Dollars 752.6m, up 12 per cent
on the 1992 quarter.
In view of its good results and the optimistic outlook for the full year,
the board of directors raised the quarterly cash dividend to 50 cents a
common share, from 25 cents, the level which had been in effect since the
first quarter of 1991.
For the first nine months of 1993, net income was Dollars 279.9m, or Dollars
17.62 a share, on net sales of Dollars 2.47bn. In the comparable period last
year, net income was Dollars 47.7m, or Dollars 3.08, on slightly higher
sales of Dollars 2.54bn.

FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: BellSouth buys 22.5% of cable
television operator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BELLSOUTH, one of the US regional telephone companies, yesterday secured a
foothold in the cable television business by agreeing a Dollars 250m deal
that will give it a 22.5 per cent stake in Prime Management, Texas-based
operator of the Prime Cable service.
The deal echoes yesterday's much bigger merger between Bell Atlantic and
Tele-Communications Inc by allowing BellSouth to expand beyond its telephone
and wireless communication operations into cable services and interactive
entertainment.
BellSouth, based in Atlanta, Georgia, has 19m telephone subscribers across
nine south-eastern states of the US, while Prime's cable systems serve more
than 500,000 customers in US markets including Houston, Chicago and Las
Vegas.
In exchange for its stake in Prime, BellSouth will lend the company Dollars
250m, which Prime will put towards a Dollars 450m recapitalisation of
Community Cable Television, a Las Vegas-based cable operator in which Prime
has a stake.
Community Cable, with more than 203,000 cable connections, owns Hospitality
Network, which provides interactive television services in 70,000 hotel
rooms nationwide.
BellSouth's financial backing should enable Prime to accelerate the growth
of its cable services, while BellSouth will gain from the opportunities to
feed its telephone services through Prime's cable networks in new
geographical markets.
Mr William Reddersen, BellSouth's recently-appointed senior vice-president
in charge of broadband strategies, said: 'This is another significant step
in preparing BellSouth to capitalise on the emerging opportunities in
interactive television, consumer entertainment and the convergence of the
communications and cable industries.'
The deal is not expected to affect BellSouth's reported interest in joining
QVC Network in its bid for Paramount Communications.
However, it was unclear yesterday whether there would still be a role for
BellSouth following Bell Atlantic's involvement in the bid through its
takeover of Tele-Communications Inc, a QVC ally.

Net income for the 13 weeks to September 26 was Dollars 66.6m, or 32 cents a
share, compared with Dollars 107.2m, or 53 cents, in the third quarter of
1992, which was a period of robust growth for the company.
Revenues slipped 5 per cent to Dollars 2.22bn, from Dollars 2.35bn a year
earlier.
Excluding special factors, however, the decline in earnings was marginal.
The 1993 results included a charge of 10 cents a share to provide for
changes in the federal corporate tax rate enacted this summer. Last year's
figure, meanwhile, reflected a one-time gain of 8 cents a share following
the partial settlement of tax refund dispute.
By contrast, Weyerhaeuser's timberlands and wood products division continued
to improve. Operating earnings climbed to Dollars 165.8m, against Dollars
103m last time, as supply shortages lifted prices for logs and lumber. Sales
volume for most products also surpassed year-earlier levels.
Weyerhaeuser's property and financial services operations earned Dollars
11.2m in the quarter, compared with Dollars 27.3m last time. The decline in
part reflects the sale earlier this year of GNA Corp, a mutual fund
business.
Although the results were in line with most analysts' expectations, the
announcement was followed by a dip in Weyerhaeuser's shares. By midday, the
stock was down Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 39.

THE US television home shopping industry received a boost when two separate
cable television groups announced ventures involving CUC International,
which offers home shopping to some 30m Americans via the telephone and
computer.
Viacom, the cable company bidding for Paramount Communications, said it
would be testing a home shopping service, in conjunction with CUC and
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, in the Castro Valley, California, where
Viacom and AT&amp;T are due to launch a full-scale test of interactive
television services next year.
Time Warner, the second largest US cable operator, said it had agreed with
CUC to create an interactive home shopping service in Orlando, Florida,
where Time Warner is establishing its first commercial
interactive-television service, the Full Service Network.
Viacom, whose bid for Paramount is competing against a higher but hostile
offer from QVC - one of the largest television home shopping networks - said
the Castro Valley test would give customers the same broad range of products
and services CUC offered to members through telephones and computers.
Time Warner said its service would offer merchandise from CUC's database of
250,000 brand-named products and would allow customers to view and buy items
on demand. CUC would use its existing systems to process orders.
Time Warner announced last month that it and Spiegel, a leading specialty
fashion retailer and catalogue company, were joining forces to create two
new cable channels.

<TEXT>
VOEST Alpine Eisenbahn-systeme (VAE), the partially privatised Austrian
maker of points (switches) and other specialised railway equipment, is
raising about Sch300m (Dollars 27m) in a one-for-six rights issue.
The funds would be used to help finance the group's expansion plans at
factories in the US, Canada and probably China. Its capital budget for this
year is Sch190m and for the 1994-96 period Sch540m.
The group's controlling shareholder, the state industrial holding company
Austrian Industries (AI), is not taking up its rights and is selling 248,000
of its existing shares to reduce its stake from 51 per cent to a blocking 26
per cent.
VAE, which has been expanding rapidly in world markets for high-speed and
heavy-duty railway installations, was floated last November on the Vienna
Borse when AI sold 49 per cent of its holding at Sch915 a share.
The price of the rights shares will be fixed on November 18 and the group
said it would be 'close to the market price', which was Sch1,495 yesterday.
The new Sch100 nominal shares will qualify for the dividend for 1993, which
the company has agreed to raise to 32 per cent from 18 per cent.
The rights issue is being underwritten and the placement managed by Bank
Austria Investment Bank and SG Warburg.
VAE said it expected its net income to rise 6.3 per cent to Sch94m this
year.
Austria Mikro-Systeme (AMS), a specialised semiconductor maker which was
floated off from Austrian Industries earlier this year, reported pre-tax
profit of Sch20m in the first half, 43 per cent higher than in the same
period of 1992.

<TEXT>
DAIWA Securities, one of Japan's big four brokerage houses, yesterday moved
against the trend in the domestic market and upgraded its interim earnings
forecast.
The firm said that the improved result would be due to higher-than-expected
bond trading profits in the wake of lower interest rates.
Daiwa raised its expected pre-tax profit for the first six months to
September to Y35.3bn (Dollars 333m) from Y30bn, nearly 20 times the amount
earned in the corresponding period last year.
The announcement reflects a difference in investment strategies between
Daiwa and other leading brokers. Last month, Nomura Securities, the largest
broker, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi Securities, revised downwards their
expectations due to weaker-than-expected stock trading commissions on the
Tokyo market.
During the six months to September, daily value of turnover on the Tokyo
stock exchange was 10 per cent lower than original expectations, and the
Nikkei index hovered around 20,000.
Daiwa placed the bulk of its funds into the government bond market, which
rallied because of lower interest rates. An increasing number of investors,
discouraged by the sluggish stock market, also piled into the market.
Daiwa said commission income was also better than expected.

INTERNATIONAL Paper, the US forest products group, posted third-quarter net
income of Dollars 48m, or 39 cents a share, including charges of Dollars
28m, or 23 cents, reflecting a higher federal income tax rate.
Sales slid to Dollars 3.4bn from Dollars 3.5bn.
Stripping out the tax adjustment, net income was Dollars 76m, or 62 cents,
in the quarter. In the same period of 1992, International Paper earned
Dollars 98m, or 81 cents.
Mr John Georges, chairman and chief executive, said depressed pricing levels
for paper and packaging products in the US and abroad had dampened the
cyclical rebound that the company had been expecting.
For the first nine months, net earnings were Dollars 189m, or Dollars 1.53,
on sales of Dollars 10.3bn, against income of Dollars 282m, or Dollars 2.17,
on sales of Dollars 10.2bn last year.

FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: German markets merger scaled
back
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS for a full-scale merger of the German derivatives market with the
market for German equities and fixed interest securities have been scaled
back, it emerged yesterday.
Only last week the Deutsche Borse - the German stock exchange - announced
far-reaching plans for a fusion with the Deutsche Terminborse (DTB),
Germany's screen-based futures and options market. This was heralded as a
step towards the full integration of the German securities markets.
Following a meeting of the supervisory board of the Deutsche Borse
yesterday, the scope of the planned merger has been curtailed, casting doubt
on the pace of reform of the German securities markets following the
creation of the Deutsche Borse at the beginning of the current year.
The meeting decided yesterday that fusion between the legal bodies which own
the Frankfurt Stock Exchange - by far the largest of the eight stock
exchanges in Germany - and the DTB was to be examined. Further co-operation
between the two entities will be limited to administrative matters and will
not extend to a full-scale fusion of dealing and settlement technologies.
This represents an about-turn from last week's statement, which presented
the merger of the two bodies as a fait accompli.
The supervisory board said then that the integration of the equities and
fixed interest markets with the derivatives market was essential to improve
the speed and reliability of transactions on the German markets, to cut
costs and enhance the competitiveness of Germany compared with other
financial markets.
Yesterday's toned-down statement from the Deutsche Borse points to tensions
with the DTB over the pace of future integration.
When the Deutsche Borse was created at the beginning of the year, it said
that merger of the DTB's settlement and trading technologies with those for
equities and fixed interest would be a priority. It now seems that concrete
measures in this area will not be discussed until next year.
The Deutsche Borse has considered enhancing the Ibis service, an electronic
dealing system for a limited number of German shares and fixed interest
securities that was introduced in April 1991. This has won a significant
share of turnover in leading German securities, but is seen as being in need
of updating - perhaps with the help of technology developed for the DTB for
the derivatives market.
But co-operation between the Deutsche Borse and the DTB looks likely to be
limited to certain administrative functions. There will be, for example, a
joint press office and a joint office to oversee market supervision.

position in insurance

<TEXT>
UNION des Assurances de Paris (UAP) has achieved its aim of becoming a force
in the European insurance industry following this week's acquisition of a
controlling stake in Colonia, the German insurer, according to Mr Jean
Peyrelevade, chairman.
He said UAP, the largest force in French insurance, was Europe's
second-largest insurer and planned to challenge Germany's Allianz for pole
position. 'UAP is now clearly a force in Europe. We're pleased to have moved
into a position where we can prepare for the race to the top.'
UAP, a candidate for privatisation by France's centre-right government, has
for four years been trying to take over Colonia, the second-biggest German
insurer. It sought to negotiate a deal with Suez, the French holding company
that owns Victoire, the French insurer with a majority interest in Colonia.
Mr Peyrelevade, who was anxious to conclude the deal before UAP's
privatisation amid speculation that he was about to become chairman of
Credit Lyonnais, the French bank, concluded the deal on Tuesday.
The agreement, a complex combination of cash payments and share swaps, is
valued at FFr8bn-FFr10bn (Dollars 1.4bn-Dollars 1.8bn). However, UAP had
paid FFr14bn for a 34 per cent minority stake in Victoire which it has ceded
to Suez. Mr Peyrelevade said the transaction would dilute UAP's earnings per
share by 10 per cent in 1994 and 6.7 per cent in 1995.
UAP intends to consolidate its interests. 'The focus of the group will
change dramatically to internal growth and profitability,' said Mr
Peyrelevade. 'After all, we've run out of money and we wouldn't want to be
imprudent.'
UAP still plans to expand its UK interests beyond its existing life
insurance business. Mr Peyrelevade said that he hoped next year to conclude
talks with a UK partner.

COMPAGNIE Generale des Eaux, the French industrial holding company,
indicated yesterday that some of the proceeds of its planned FFr3bn-FFr4bn
(Dollars 535-Dollars 714m) rights issue would be devoted to developing
cellular phones in Europe and electricity production in the US. These are
among the group's fastest-growing activities, and it plans FFr3bn investment
this year.
Announcing the rights issue on Tuesday night, the company said its aim was
to 'reinforce its own funds', but a spokeswoman yesterday pointed out that
group equity, together with convertible bonds, totalled FFr29bn, outweighing
long-term debt at the end of last year.
The rights issue brings to FFr35bn the amount of new equity that companies
have raised, or plan to raise, this year, in addition to the government's
programme to sell around FFr40bn of state assets this autumn, according to
Mr Michel Vigier of Cholet Dupont.
This compares with a total of FFr50bn equity raised last year. The volume of
convertible bond issues has also risen from FFr3bn in the whole of 1992, to
FFr12bn so far this year.

FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: Woolworth takes Dollars 480m
charge to cover shake-up
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WOOLWORTH, the US retailer, yesterday announced a Dollars 480m after-tax
charge against third-quarter earnings to cover restructuring, which includes
closing about 10 per cent of its stores and slashing its workforce by about
9 per cent, or 13,000 jobs.
Woolworth's sales performance has been lagging its competitors. The company
disappointed Wall Street as earnings were eroded in the first and second
quarters of this year when total profits were only Dollars 3m, or 2 cents a
share, compared with net income of Dollars 50m, or 38 cents, for the first
six months of 1992.
In last year's third quarter, the group posted after-tax profits of Dollars
65m on sales of Dollars 2.5bn.
Woolworth will close about 970 general merchandise and specialty stores in
the US and Canada over the next few months. These stores suffered operating
losses of Dollars 36m in the first half of this year.
About 250 of those stores to be closed will be changed into more profitable
formats - primarily into the group's athletic footwear and apparel chains.
Woolworth will remodel and revamp the merchandise in some of its Kinney shoe
stores and convert 100 Woolworth stores in Canada into its Bargain Shop
chain.
In the US, Woolworth will close 400, or about half of its Woolworth general
merchandise stores. It will close 330, or about one-third of its Kinney and
Footquarters shoe stores. In Canada, only about 5 per cent of the group's
stores will be closed permanently.
The news prompted Standard &amp; Poor's, the US ratings agency, to downgrade its
ratings on Woolworth's debt, preferred stock and commercial paper.
The agency believes the write-off highlights problems Woolworth is having in
its general merchandise and Kinney family footwear businesses in addition to
the general malaise in the retailing environment.
Moody's Investors Service, which coincidentally placed Woolworth's
commercial paper on review for possible downgrade, was concerned that
Woolworth might be facing a decline in long-term demand in many of its
markets.
Mr William Lavin, who replaced Mr Harold Sells as chairman and chief
executive in July, said the programme was 'consistent with a key strategic
priority of the company: the restructuring, reformating and revitalising of
businesses which can meet the company's financial objectives within a
reasonable time span and the redeploying of assets away from those
businesses which cannot.'
He blamed unfavourable economic conditions in North America, increased
competitive pressures and the generally depressed consumer-spending
environment for increased store closures.
Woolworth said it did not expect the programme to have a large impact on it
cash flows on an after-tax basis.

MANNESMANN closed the third quarter with a loss, the German industrial,
engineering and telecommunication group said yesterday in the prospectus for
its recently-announced one-for-eight rights issue.
It did not give any details of the size of the loss, but blamed it on
structural measures, the costs of building up its mobile phone network and
poor business conditions in July and August.
In August, the Dusseldorf-based company reported a plunge into losses of
DM467m (Dollars 292.6m) in the first half of the year, down from a profit of
DM15m in the first half of 1992.
The group expects to make a substantial loss this year, but turnover for
1993 is likely to be at around the same level as last year, when group
turnover was DM28bn.
The group said the loss reflected the costs of a one-off restructuring
within the group.
In spite of the short-term impact on profits, the measures would lead to a
large reduction in the group's break-even level and there will be a
substantial improvement in the group's results next year even if the economy
continues to weaken.
Another positive factor next year is that Mannesmann Mobilfunk, the group's
cellular telephone subsidiary, is poised to make a profit in 1994 after
years of losses.
Bremer Vulkan Verbund, the shipbuilding and engineering group, said its
machine tool unit had taken over rival Droop und Rein for an undisclosed
sum, Reuter reports from Bremen.

<TEXT>
NORWAY'S finance ministry yesterday cleared the way for state-owned
Christiania Bank, Norway's second-biggest bank, to be partially privatised.
The ministry also said it expected Den norske Bank, the biggest bank, to
make a public offering of shares.
Earlier this year, the ministry indicated that it would dispose of at least
part of its shareholding. However, yesterday it said an issue of new shares,
which would dilute the state's stake, was more likely.
'Christiania has now been given the clear signal to prepare a major issue of
new shares which can take place either late this year or early next year,'
the ministry said.
Mr Ole Kristian Udnes, Christiania's chief financial officer, said he
welcomed the state's decision to approve a public offering rather than a
state sell-off.
'Our feeling is that the market is positive towards a share issue and
various market players have expressed interest in Scandinavian bank shares
in general,' Mr Udnes said.
He added that Christiania hoped to disclose details of the offering on
November 4, when the bank's third-quarter result is due to be published, or
shortly afterwards.
Domestic banking industry sources expected Christiania's issue to be
launched in two steps to test market conditions.
DnB, which is 69 per cent owned by the state, said that it hoped to disclose
details of a possible share issue on October 26, when the bank will publish
its third-quarter figures. However, DnB is not expected to launch a share
offering until 1994 and it is likely to be smaller than Christiania's.
Christiania Bank and DnB returned to profit in the first half after several
successive years of losses. DnB then said it did not need to call on a

FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: Bremen in talks to find buyer
for Klockner-Werke steel mill
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BREMEN, the German city-state, yesterday confirmed it was holding talks with
domestic and international steel companies in an attempt to find a buyer for
the integrated steel mill of Klockner-Werke, the ailing German steel group.
Mr Claus Jager, the state economics minister, said that Sidma, a subsidiary
of the Arbed steelmaker in Luxembourg, was among those in the discussions.
The talks form part of the state's strategy to fend off a rival offer made
by Thyssen and Krupp-Hoesch, Germany's two largest steelmakers.
The state, which has one of the highest unemployment rates in Germany, is
concerned about he future of the 4,600 jobs at the Klockner-Werke plant. It
says the Thyssen's proposal would only keep 1,000 employees.
Thyssen yesterday said it had no intention of closing down any part of the
mill. It said it was only interested in buying the cold-rolling mill and not
the whole integrated mill.
Mr Jager said Thyssen and Krupp-Hoesch wanted to acquire the Klockner-Werke
plant to partially close it and eliminate a competitor in the German steel
market. 'We are instead trying to find a solution with other companies who
know the steel market.'
Sidma, which is 67 per cent owned by Arbed, said that it had an interest in
the future of Klockner-Werke's plant because of its co-operation with the
German group in Belgium. Klockner-Werke owns 25 per cent of Allegheny Ludlum
Corporation (ALZ), a subsidiary of Sidma in Gent which produces stainless
steel. It also has a 30 per cent stake in Sikel, a subsidiary producing
metal sheets for household goods.
Sidma said: 'We are investigating the possibility of some co-operation
between Sidma and Klockner-Werke. But it is too early to say what form this
co-operation will take.'
In Luxembourg, Arbed yesterday denied any intention to acquire a stake in
the Klockner-Werke steel plant. It confirmed that talks were taking place,
but stressed that they had focused mostly on the future of the German
group's joint ventures in Belgium.
Klockner-Werke's shares on the Frankfurt stock market rose to a 1993 high,
up DM7 at DM91.50. Traders said the rise was fuelled by speculation that
Bremen may put in a bid for the plant on behalf of an industry consortium.
Mr Jager said that the Bremen state would rather avoid taking a stake in the
steel plant and was seeking private investors.

FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: Differing visions that divide a
family - Tim Coone on why an injunction has been granted to the ousted
chairman of Dunnes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SIX-MONTH boardroom struggle over the control of Dunnes Stores, the
largest supermarket and retailing chain in the Irish Republic, intensified
this week following a temporary High Court injunction being granted to Mr
Ben Dunne, the ousted chief executive and chairman, against his other
partners in the family-run company.
Control of the family empire, one of the largest in Ireland and estimated to
be worth some IPounds 700m (Pounds 670m), has for many Irish people taken on
the semblance of a real-life soap opera, complete with family scandal and
public disgrace.
Mr Dunne's legal action followed the dismissal last Friday of two senior
managers, including Mr Michael Irwin, the chief accountant, and the
resignation of four other senior managers. The injunction restrains Dunnes
from making any further dismissals of senior management or from making any
investments involving sums exceeding IPounds 500,000 without approval of the
full board.
Mr Dunne was ousted as chairman and chief executive of the group in February
after a boardroom coup by three siblings, who with him comprise the board of
directors.
No reasons were given for his removal, but it occurred several months after
Mr Dunne resumed his duties following a conviction in a Florida court last
year on a charge of cocaine possession. He paid a Dollars 5,000 (Pounds
3,000) fine, was ordered to attend a drug addiction clinic in London, and
has been barred from entering the US.
The incident caused deep embarrassment to his family, but was the
opportunity his three sibling-directors had been looking for to resolve a
simmering dispute over the future direction of the chain.
Mr Dunne's retailing philosophy followed that of his father, also called
Ben, who founded the company 50 years ago to provide quality products but at
prices which made them available to a mass market and working class pockets.
The group has engaged regularly in price wars with its competitors and is
renowned for negotiating tough terms with suppliers. Its retail margins are
very tight, but an important source of its profits is thought to be derived
through supplier credit. This allows the supermarket to accumulate large
sums of cash which are then invested in the short-term money market.
As a private unlimited company, Dunnes is not required to disclose financial
details. It is believed, however, to generate profits of about IPounds 50m
on turnover of about IPounds 900m. It has 75 supermarket and drapery outlets
in Ireland, with 6,000 employees. The company also has 23 stores in Northern
Ireland and a further 5 in northern Britain.
Mr Dunne fell out with his elder sister, Mrs Margaret Heffernan, who
reportedly wanted the group to go more up-market and who won the backing of
two of the other directors, Mr Frank Dunne and Ms Therese Dunne. Executive
control is exercised jointly by Margaret and Frank.
Mr Ben Dunne's autocratic style of management apparently helped alienate him
from his siblings, as did his wish to keep the group a private concern
rather than seek an eventual flotation.
The one sister who supported him, Mrs Elizabeth McMahon, died of a heart
attack in July. A fourth sister is not involved with the family business.
Although ousted from any executive position, Mr Dunne as a director has
maintained contact with senior managers to obtain financial information on
the group.
In an affidavit to the High Court this week, he claimed that group profits
had slipped by IPounds 11m, market share had suffered 'a significant
decline', and that the group was committed to a IPounds 30m capital
expenditure programme which he described as 'questionable and foolhardy' and
which had not received approval by the full board.
Mr Irwin, the ousted chief accountant, told the High Court this week, that
he believed his dismissal was due to his unwillingness to become involved in
the family feud which, he said, was aimed at excluding Mr Ben Dunne.
In March Mr Dunne took over Dunloe, a quoted property company, which he
subsequently said he wishes to see develop into a fruit and vegetable
distribution business.
It is thought that he now wishes to cash in his shares, believed to
represent a Dunnes stake of 20 per cent and worth about IPounds 140m, to
develop the Dunloe business, but which his fellow directors in Dunnes fear
he may use to set up a rival supermarket chain.
The complex shareholding arrangement in Dunnes, established as a trust by
its founder, makes it extremely difficult for any director to dispose of
shares without the approval of the other directors.
Mr Dunne has said publicly that he is unable to proceed with his plans for
Dunloe because of the ongoing board disputes at Dunnes.

FT  14 OCT 93 / UK Company News: N Brown ahead 21% following growth in sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOWER INTEREST costs and a healthy sales gain helped N Brown, the
Manchester-based direct mail order group which specialises in clothing for
older women, report a 21 per cent increase in first half profits.
The pre-tax line increased to Pounds 9.02m (Pounds 7.44m) in the 26 weeks to
August 28 on turnover ahead 8.3 per cent to Pounds 86.2m (Pounds 79.6m).
Operating profits increased to Pounds 10.3m (Pounds 9.4m).
Interest costs fell by Pounds 647,000 to Pounds 1.16m with Pounds 400,000 of
the decline attributable to lower rates and the balance reflecting an
improved stock turn.
This also helped reduce gearing, which fell to 33 per cent from 49 per cent
a year earlier.
Earnings per share increased from 6.84p to 8.29p and the interim dividend is
raised from 1.95p to 2.25p.
Turnover in the core home shopping division increased by 8.6 per cent and
operating profits expanded 8.1 per cent to Pounds 10.4m.
Mr Jim Martin, chief executive, said the increase in turnover mainly
reflected customers ordering more items, and ordering more often.
The group's established catalogues - J D Williams, Ambrose Wilson, Oxendales
and the slightly more up-market Heather Valley - continued to grow and still
account for the bulk of turnover and operating profits.
These catalogues all cater for more mature customers and offer a much wider
range of sizes and fittings than would be found in the High Street.
Fashion World and Candid, the newer titles which were launched in 1991 and
are designed for slightly younger customers, continued to increase their
share of turnover and profit. They now account for 9 per cent of turnover.
The group's small property and financial division made an operating profit
of Pounds 48,000, against a comparable loss of Pounds 33,000, and a Pounds
240,000 deficit in last year's second half.
Sir David Alliance, chairman, said all the autumn/winter catalogues had
started well, with encouraging gains in average order values and some early
indications that new customer recruitment is stronger than in the past few
seasons.

FT  14 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Anglo-Eastern more than doubled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCREASED palm oil production helped Anglo-Eastern Plantations to more than
double pre-tax profits from Pounds 530,000 to Pounds 1.2m for the first half
of 1993.
Palm oil production from the group's 6,500 hectare Tasik estate in northern
Sumatra rose from 32,994 tonnes to 45,718 tonnes. Target production for 1997
is 130,000 tonnes of palm oil.
Outside processing carried out by the dedicated crushing mill, opened in
1991, increased from 8,900 tonnes to more than 28,000 tonnes.
Mr Rollo Barnes, chief executive, said the Tasik estate was coming to
maturity. At the same time a shortage of crushing capacity in the area had
raised the throughput at the group's mill.
The average palm oil price obtained at Rotterdam in the half was Dollars 375
a tonne, although the price had since fallen to about Dollars 340 a tonne.
Production in the first three months of the second half was well up on last
year and if this trend continued, the group said results for the year should
be very satisfactory.
Turnover was ahead 54 per cent from Pounds 2.26m to Pounds 3.5m. Earnings
per share rose from 1.4p to 3p, and the interim dividend is up from 0.375p
to 0.5p.
The group said no provision had been made for expenses relating to
Chillington Corporation's planned sale of most of its 49 per cent stake in
Anglo-Eastern to Genton International of Hong Kong. It estimates its
expenses at between Pounds 120,000 and Pounds 160,000.
Shareholders in Chillington, which also has interests in property and
engineering, vote on the sale early next month. If it is approved, Genton
will make a full offer for the rest of Anglo-Eastern at 68p a share.
Yesterday the shares were unchanged at 74p.

FT  14 OCT 93 / UK Company News: US and Japanese shortfalls leave Densitron
at Pounds 0.25m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Densitron International fell 5p to 32p yesterday after the
electronic components manufacturer reported pre-tax profits down from Pounds
370,000 to Pounds 251,000 in the first half of 1993.
Mr Cliff Hardcastle, chairman, said all parts of the company were trading
profitably, although there were reduced profits in the US and Japan.
The Japanese situation, in particular, was expected to improve rapidly in
the second half. Orders and sales were already showing an improvement which,
if continued, would help towards a satisfactory outcome for the full year,
he added.
An improved second half - similar to last year - was expected, but the final
outcome was dependent upon relatively large contracts deliverable in the
last quarter.
Mr Hardcastle pointed out that currency changes had made a significant
impact on the reported figures, with the result that the indicated increases
in overhead costs and sales were overstated.
First-half turnover rose from Pounds 23.4m to Pounds 28m, but after
eliminating the effect of currency changes, sales volume remained level,
with a small reduction in gross margin.
A tax credit of Pounds 17,000 (Pounds 166,000 charge) - the result of higher
UK profits being sheltered from tax by prior years' losses and lower
earnings abroad - meant earnings per share were higher at 1.12p (0.8p).
An increased interim dividend of 0.5p (0.4p) is declared.
Mr Hardcastle reported that Densitron had taken a legal action in the US
against a Japanese competitor concerning the misuse of confidential
information.
Costs of the action were 'quite significant', he said, but at this time, the
company expected to recover all of its costs, plus damages.
The case is due to come to court in mid-December.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARCADIAN International, the leisure-based developer and operator, is in
negotiations with separate vendors that may lead to the purchase of eight
hotels in the south of England and Jersey, writes John Murrell.
The company intends to fund the acquisitions in part via a rights issue to
raise some Pounds 11.5m net. With negotiations still under way terms of the
cash call were not available.
Consideration would be met by a combination of cash, new ordinary shares and
warrants.
The acquisitions would comprise a hotel company, together with the hotel
business and assets of two subsidiaries of Hidden Hotels.
In addition, Arcadian will assume debt in the hotel company which is not
expected to exceed Pounds 12.8m. Both acquisitions would be subject to
shareholders' approval.
Of the money being raised, some Pounds 5.5m would fund the cash
consideration of the Hidden Hotels. The balance would be used to reduce the
enlarged group's debt, meet remaining investment requirements and provide
extra working capital.
Mr Robert Breare, chief executive, said Arcadian had been looking for
quality hotels in the UK to balance its portfolio of hotel, golf and country
club developments located mainly in continental Europe.
He added that the hotels under discussion met 'all our criteria'.

London &amp; Overseas Freighters, the Bermuda-based shipping company ultimately
controlled by Iroquois Shipping Corporation of Liberia, reported income
before tax of Dollars 1.56m (Pounds 1.02m) for the six months to September
30.
The results, compiled under US generally accepted accounting principles,
compared with a restated deficit of Dollars 165,000 last time.
Net freights and hire amounted to Dollars 10.9m (Dollars 7.54m) reflecting
the commencement in July of the five year Chevron charter on the London
Pride, increases built into daily rates of similar charters on the London
Spirit and London Victory and improved trading conditions for the London
Enterprise.
Earnings per share emerged at 6.4 cents (losses 1 cent).
The company plans an international offering of up to 5m American Depositary
Shares at between Dollars 15 and Dollars 17 apiece. Proceeds will be used to
finance expansion of its oil tanker fleet.
Furman Selz and NatWest Securities are managers and the latter is also

FT  14 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Delyn falls Pounds 142,000 into the red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EXCEPTIONAL charges of Pounds 591,000 pushed Delyn Group, the manufacturer
of consumer packaging and materials, Pounds 142,000 into the red at the
pre-tax level for the 26 weeks ended August 1.
That compared with previous profits of Pounds 500,000 and was struck from
turnover of Pounds 6.71m (Pounds 6m).
Losses per share worked through at 3.55p (earnings 3.94p).
The interim dividend is held at 0.5p.
The exceptional provision related to Delyn's holding in Plastella which was
disposed of in May.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATWEST Markets Corporate Finance yesterday announced the formation of a new
Lloyd's investment trust.
The trust will be designed to raise as much as Pounds 75m in equity capital
to support the Lloyd's of London insurance market.
The Angerstein Underwriting Trust will be listed on the stock exchange and
is expected to invest in a range of Lloyd's syndicates.
NatWest has been working closely with Coutts, the private bank, and aims to
market the new trust to institutional and private investors.
Stace Barr Underwriting Agencies, an independent members' agent, will advise
Angerstein.
NatWest Wood Mackenzie will be broker and NatWest Investment Management will
be investment manager.
Mr Andrew Smithers, chairman of Angerstein, said: 'The proposed introduction
of corporate capital not only provides an opening to invest in Lloyd's,
without the risks of unlimited liability, but it comes at a time that
appears favourable for investors.'

ARJO Wiggins Appleton, the Franco-British paper group, has received
permission from the Commission des Operations de Bourse to have its shares
listed on the Paris Bourse, writes Paul Abrahams.
The shares will start trading on October 19. No new equity is being issued
as a result of the listing, which is being sponsored by Demachy Worms, the
banking subsidiary of Worms, the French holding company.
Worms owns 36 per cent of St Louis which in turn holds nearly 40 per cent of
Arjo. UBS France and BNP were co-sponsors for the listing.
Mr Cob Stenham, chairman, said the listing would reflect the company's
extensive continental operations which account for about half of group
turnover. His initial target for the French shareholding is about 3 per
cent.

FT  14 OCT 93 / UK Company News: An evolutionary route into equity sectors -
Christopher Price on the latest batch of warrants aimed at attracting a new
breed of investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAUNCH of two warrants in the past week aimed at the UK equity market
mark an inventive step by stockbrokers to encourage investors into areas
which they might otherwise be reluctant to enter.
SG Warburg yesterday issued a multi-media warrant, which gives holders the
option to buy the underlying media shares at a future date, aimed at
investors wanting exposure to the new frontiers of technology.
Last week, BZW launched a warrant on a basket of food retail shares. It is
also looking at several other underperforming areas of the UK equity market
for similar launches, which could include sectors such as pharmaceuticals
and food manufacturing.
However, the rarity of sector warrants and other similar derivative products
in UK equities is testimony to the cool reception afforded them by investors
in the past.
Derivatives specialists and fund managers will be watching the progress of
this latest product closely.
The BZW warrant acts as a 'call' option, which attempts to anticipate a rise
in the share prices on a basket of food retail stocks. Investors buy the
warrant at a price struck by the issuer.
They can exercise their option to buy the underlying shares from the issuer
at the price on the day of the warrant's purchase. This can be done at any
time over the period of the warrant.
Each of the warrants cost Pounds 2.30 on the October 4 launch day for shares
worth Pounds 18.80 in the seven leading supermarket groups, which are
weighted by market capitalisation.
The warrants, which had an underlying stock value at issue of about Pounds
100m, are exerciseable over the next 18 months.
Should the basket price rise 20 per cent, for example, over the full life of
the warrant, it would reach Pounds 22.56. The Pounds 3.76 rise in the value
of the shares would equal the approximate cost of the warrant at expiry.
This sum less the Pounds 2.30 original cost would give a profit on the
warrant of some 63 per cent. Investors are likely to hold the warrant for a
highly geared return, with the option to buy into the underlying stocks if
the outlook for the sector holds up.
Investors can also trade the warrant, the market being made by the issuer
with the price moving relative to the underlying stock prices. Yesterday,
for example, the food retail warrant had a mid-price of Pounds 2.37 with a
basket price of Pounds 18.82.
For the issuer, profiting from the exercise will require effective 'dynamic'
hedging. Although neither BZW nor SG Warburg discuss their risk management
techniques, typically a warrant issuer will carry about 60 per cent of the
underlying stock - the hedge ratio - of the number of warrants issued.
The broker will also make continuous use of the options market as part of
its hedging operations on the underlying stock.
Getting the hedge ratios right will ensure the success of the warrant. The
higher the sector rises, the bigger the increase in the ratio to compensate.
Problems can arise with a sudden and significant movement in the sector
which would leave the issuer exposed to taking a hit on the underlying
stock. A warrant issued on the water stocks before the last year's general
election was upset by a one-day surge of 20 per cent in the sector, leaving
the US issuer exposed and some investors out of profit.
Mr Lenny Barshak, director of derivatives at Smith New Court, says that
market volatility is the biggest threat to a warrant's success. But as
important is institutional investor wariness in using derivatives. 'If the
demand from customers is there, we are always ready to create the product to
suit their needs,' he says. 'But in general, the response to new product
launches in the UK market has been patchy.'
Mr Gary Wolens, managing director European equity sales at Salamon Brothers,
agrees. 'Although there is a steady acceptance in the willingness to use
derivatives in the UK, it will be an evolutionary not revolutionary
development.'
Derivatives brokers complain that part of the reason for this is the
conservative investment culture among UK institutions.
Fund managers argue that restrictive regulations together with the pricing
of some products has proved discouraging. Mr Jim McAfferty, a former fund
manager at NatWest Investment Bank, and now at Hoare Govett, says: 'The
standard view among institutions is that it is difficult to get approval
from trustees for the extra risk of taking out warrants or options.'
BZW hopes to get round investor reluctance through more aggressive marketing
and keener pricing. 'There's no point is issuing a warrant that will not
sell,' says Mr David Roden, the broker's head of derivatives. 'We place a
high premium on our corporate relationships, so selling them a good product
at a reasonable price is very important.'
Mr Roden says that the new warrant 'offers a different risk profile' for
investors who are interested in exposure to the recovery potential of a
sector without the full financial commitment. The launch was designed to
coincide with BZW's research team turning more positive on the food retail
sector, which has underperformed the rest of the stock market by 30 per cent
in the past six months.
Mr Mark Beilby, European media analyst at SG Warburg, says: 'We are trying
to introduce an investment vehicle which transcends sector and country
boundaries to enable investors to access new industry trends.'

FT  14 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Forte to float airport services side next
year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORTE, the hotel and restaurant group, said yesterday that it intended to
float its airport services division on the Stock Exchange early next year.
Forte had signalled the move last year when it failed to sell the business,
along with its Gardner Merchant contract catering division, to the Compass
group. Gardner Merchant was sold to its management and a venture capital
consortium at the end of last year.
Some analysts had expected the division's flotation to take place in a few
years' time. The market, however, quickly digested the news of a quicker
flotation and Forte's shares closed down 5p at 222 1/2 p.
The group said the exact timing of the flotation would depend on stock
market conditions next year. The division is expected to be valued at
between Pounds 200m and Pounds 250m. Mr Rocco Forte, chairman, said he would
be happy with a price above Pounds 210m and would not want the division to
be valued at anything below that.
Forte will retain a 25 per stake which Mr Forte described as a medium-term
investment.
The division, which employs 6,000 people worldwide, has two sectors: flight
catering and airport retailing.
The catering arm provides 45m in-flight meals a year to 150 airlines. The
airport retailing arm is the largest in the UK.
The division made trading profits of Pounds 17m on turnover of Pounds 404m
in the year to January 31 1993. In the first half of the current year,
trading profits were Pounds 12m on turnover of Pounds 208m.
Mr Bruce Jones, an analyst with Smith New Court, said that although the
planned flotation had been announced some time ago, he still questioned its
wisdom. The airline meals business fitted in well with Forte's other
catering activities, which include the Welcome Break, Happy Eater and Little
Chef roadside restaurant chains.
Mr Forte said, however, that the provision of in-flight meals was more of a
manufacturing than a catering business.
Analysts said the sale would reduce pressure on Forte to accept a low bid
for its Harvester restaurant chain, which is up for sale. They said the
flotation would also reduce the likelihood of a rights issue. Mr Forte said
he did not believe the group needed a rights issue and none was planned.
He said some of the flotation proceeds would be used to reduce debt, which
stood at Pounds 1.3bn at the end of July.
The remainder would be used to expand the remaining hotel and restaurant
businesses. Mr Forte said no large acquisition was in prospect.

FT  14 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Starmin facing legal battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STARMIN, the troubled quarry products group now chaired by Lord Parkinson,
the former Cabinet minister, was yesterday facing a legal battle with a
former director who resigned a month before the company said pre-tax losses
were millions of pounds deeper than previously published.
Mr Osman Abdullah, who controlled the company from 1989 with his brother
Raschid, is believed to be suing the company over the termination of his
service contract following his resignation in July.
Mr Raschid Abdullah, who also resigned as an executive in July, was last
month reappointed as a non-executive director and speaks for about 30 per
cent of the equity. He declined to say whether he now planned to take action
against the company and said that his brother was on holiday.
The resignations by the brothers, who first gained a public profile for
their work at the Evered aggregates company, coincided with Starmin's
announcement of a review of accounting procedures which led to the company
rescinding its dividend and announcing 1992 pre-tax losses had been
understated by Pounds 3.8m, deepening them to Pounds 11.9m.
The review of accounting policies focused on profits booked on asset swaps.
Starmin said at the time that there was no suggestion of fraud.
No one at Starmin was prepared to comment. However, note 29 of the company's
1992 Report and Accounts flags the possibility of claims and the board's
intention to resist them: 'The company will strenuously resist any such
claims and the board considers that adequate provision has been made in the
accounts at 31 December 1992 for any such liability,' the note says.

FT  14 OCT 93 / UK Company News: WSP to merge with AB Consulting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WSP HOLDINGS and AB Consulting, two consulting engineering companies, are to
merge to form an enlarged group worth about Pounds 9.8m.
The renamed WSP Group will have a combined turnover of more than Pounds 20m.
Mr Malcolm Paul, finance director on the new board, said that some 80 per
cent of its business would come from buildings-oriented consulting and the
balance from science and environmental services, the non-buildings side
which the combined group would be keen to expand.
The merger is to be effected through the recommended offer by WSP for all
the issued share capital of ABC, on the basis of six new WSP shares for
every five ABC shares. This values ABC at about Pounds 5.3m.
The WSP board, advised by Rea Brothers, is unanimously recommending its
shareholders to approve the merger and the ABC board, advised by Albert E
Sharp, unanimously recommends acceptance. Both have irrevocably undertaken
to do so in respect of their own shareholdings. In ABC's case this
represents about 11.2 per cent of the equity.
Mr Paul said that the combined group would be in 'the top one or two
consulting engineers in building structures', but that it would not be big
on the civil engineering side. However, the new board 'envisaged moves' in
that direction.
He said WSP felt the industry was 'right at the bottom of the recession' and
the merger 'was sensible in view of the current market place'.
The merger would result in a substantial and immediate reduction in
overheads. No technical or engineering jobs would be lost, but between 10
and 15 administrative posts would go. Duplicated offices would be closed and
the group's buying powers would increase.
In 1992 WSP made pre-tax profits of Pounds 560,000 on turnover of Pounds
10m. For the year to April 30, ABC reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.15m
on turnover of Pounds 11m.

FT  14 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Allders pathfinder indicates strong advance
to Pounds 23m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OPERATING PROFITS at Allders, the department store and duty-free retailer,
are estimated to have reached Pounds 23m in the year to September 30.
That compares with the Pounds 15.3m before exceptional items achieved last
time.
However, the latest financial year covered 53 weeks and excluding the extra
period the profit would have been Pounds 21.4m. The figure was revealed in
the pathfinder prospectus for the group's flotation next month.
The prospectus says there are signs of recovery in the UK market, while the
duty free side was exceeding expectations apart from the San Francisco
store. Allders is suing the city and county of San Francisco over the poor
performance of the outlet there.
The document says the group's trading prospects are 'significantly better
than at any time since the buy-out'. The group was formed by a management
buy-out from Hanson in 1989.
The float is expected to value the company at close to Pounds 200m, and it
aims to raise about Pounds 85m for the company through a placing and public
offer.
Existing shareholders have yet to decide if they will sell shares in the
issue. Hanson holds 5 per cent of the equity, with 94 per cent held by
institutions who backed the mbo, and supported a Pounds 10m rights issue in
1991.
Management holds 1 per cent at present. Share options will be granted which
could give 130 managers about 5 per cent of the enlarged share capital,
depending on the price at which the shares are floated. Within that Mr
Harvey Lipsith, chief executive, will hold less than 1 per cent of the
total, and the options cannot be exercised for a year.
Mr Lipsith said Allders was a 'well established and resilient business'
which, despite heavy debts from its mbo, had invested Pounds 55m in the
business in the last four years and repaid Pounds 30m of debt.
He said the group's two activities were each large operators in fragmented
sectors. Sales from the department stores in the year just ended were 10 per
cent higher at an estimated Pounds 286m, and operating profits were up 20
per cent to Pounds 12m.
Mr Lipsith said growth would come from geographic expansion, especially the
development of the six-strong chain of 'at Home with Allders' household
stores, which could reach 50 in 10 years, and from economic recovery.
The duty-free retail business had 4 per cent of the Pounds 10bn worldwide
market, and operated on four continents. Sales were estimated at Pounds
399m, up 21 per cent, in the latest year, with profits nearly doubled at
Pounds 13m (Pounds 6.7m) - partly a bounce back from the Gulf war.
The 1993 figures will bear exceptional costs of Pounds 14m, including a
Pounds 10.5m write-down of property values and the Pounds 3m cost of gaining
a listing. However, exceptional credits will have totalled Pounds 5.1m.

FT  14 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Commercial vehicles boost Chas Sidney
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG GROWTH in commercial vehicle sales helped Charles Sidney, the
Yorkshire-based Mercedes-Benz commercial vehicle and passenger car dealer
show a near 40 per cent increase in operating profits for the year to August
31.
Charles Sidney, part of Albert Fisher, the food processing and distribution
group, is coming to the market via a placing with institutional investors
and public offer early next month.
The pathfinder prospectus for the proposed flotation was issued yesterday
and revealed full year operating profits of Pounds 2.44m, up from Pounds
1.76m the previous year, on turnover 35 per cent higher at Pounds 55.8m
(Pounds 41.3m).
The group, which ranks as the largest Mercedes-Benz commercial dealer in the
UK and the sixth largest car dealer, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds
2.46m (Pounds 1.7m).
Commercial vehicles, which have underpinned the group's performance in
recent years, contributed Pounds 1.75m (Pounds 1.25m) of last year's
operating profits and Pounds 35.1m (Pounds 21.7m) of total turnover with
sales of new vehicles jumping from 648 to 993.
The strong performance of the commercial vehicles segment offset the
weakness of new car sales which reflected the delayed recovery of the luxury
car sector and customers waiting for Mercedes' new models which were
launched at the start of October.
Mr Raymond Edwards, Albert Fisher's director responsible for the European
food processing division including Charles Sidney, who will leave the group
to become Charles Sidney's executive chairman, said sales of luxury cars
have begun to pick up since the end of August.
The final prospectus, together with details of the offer, is due to be
published on October 27 and dealings in the new shares are expected to begin
on November 10.

FT  14 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Attwoods moves back to basics - Analysts
welcome disposal of US recycling business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTWOODS' sale of its lossmaking Mindis recycling business in the US was
widely welcomed yesterday as the necessary, if painful, removal of a nasty
thorn.
Mindis has proved, with hindsight, an extremely costly foray into recycling
 -a business driven more by politicians than economics and, consequently,
one that has struggled to take off. It was also a business exposed to wild
swings - recently downwards - in base metal prices.
However, the announcement of the Dollars 40m (Pounds 26m) sale and the
Pounds 91m provision to cover the resulting loss was accompanied by a set of
results for the year to end-July from which it was difficult to isolate the
performance of the ongoing business.
The headline figures were a preliminary pre-tax loss of Pounds 62.2m
compared with a profit of Pounds 25.1m, on sales up 20 per cent at Pounds
410m, and losses per share of 25.25p (earnings 6.84p).
Looking forward, Attwoods focused on pro-forma profits on continuing
business, excluding Mindis, where the pre-tax figure rose from Pounds 27.2m
to Pounds 33.1m. On this basis earnings per share rose from 7.98p to 8.96p.
However, the picture is more complicated. Attwoods profits included a Pounds
5.4m exceptional profit from a well timed D-Mark currency hedge which will
continue to generate cash on a monthly basis while the D-Mark remains at
current levels. There was also a receipt of Pounds 2.9m from an insurance
claim.
The interest line was also affected by changes in the accounting rules that
reclassify preference shares as debt for presentation purposes, even though
Attwoods' banks consider them to be equity instruments.
Interest on these shares now appears above the line. But the main change to
interest is a Pounds 2.4m increase as a result of translation of interest on
foreign denominated debt.
There is also a Pounds 2.01m provision covering a US litigation, which under
the FRS 3 standard now appears above the line as an exceptional item.
Regarding the Pounds 91m provision, only Pounds 61.2m hits the balance
sheet. The balance of Pounds 30m is goodwill on acquisition of Mindis which
must be written back to the profit and loss account on disposal.
Mr Ken Foreman, chairman, welcomed the opportunity for Attwoods to get back
to its mainstream business of managing waste contracts. 'Mindis has taken a
lot of our time,' he said. 'The sale will allow us to focus on the growth
areas and getting better returns from the existing business.'
However, the market may need some time to digest Attwoods' figures and the
implications of the replacement of Mr Donald Jackson at the head of Laidlaw,
the Canadian company that controls 38 per cent of Attwoods.
Analysts yesterday welcomed the removal of the unpredictable Mindis business
and a return to the comparative certainty of long term waste collection
contracts.
A strong start to the year in the UK and the US is only partly offset by the
poor performance in Germany, where nevertheless, Mr Foreman says the group
is still making higher margins than in the UK.
Analysts said that Attwoods could therefore make pre-tax profits of about
Pounds 36.3m this year, including profits from the foreign exchange hedge,
giving earnings of 9.2p.
Finding new contracts outside the US, the UK and Europe is not, however,
going to happen overnight so growth from new markets may be some time off.

FT  14 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Gloucester Steam plans to raise Pounds 0.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF Britain's leading steam railways has launched a rights issue to
finance the re-opening of a former British Rail service.
Gloucester and Warwickshire Steam Rail, the privately-owned railway company,
aims to raise Pounds 400,000 from the issue, which is targeted mainly at
enthusiasts.
The shares, priced at Pounds 1 each, will not be available in blocks of less
than Pounds 20. The proceeds will be used to fund the first stage of a
Pounds 1m scheme to reopen the 23-mile Honeybourne Line between
Stratford-upon-Avon and Cheltenham.
The line, originally built by the Great Western Railway, was closed 14 years
ago because of falling passenger numbers.
If the project is successful, the company expects the line - part of which
it already operates between Toddington and Gretton in Gloucestershire - to
attract tourists and possibly commuters on the cross-country route.
Mr David Mee, commercial manager, said: 'Once we have extended it south into
Cheltenham we hope the extra revenue from the line will finance the route
north through Broadway into Stratford.
'We will eventually have 23 miles of track and one of the longest private
railway lines in Britain.'

FT  14 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitions behind 49% rise at Seton
Healthcare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACQUISITIONS helped Seton Healthcare, the medical products and sports
equipment group, increase pre-tax profits by 49 per cent to Pounds 3.18m in
the six months to August 31.
The Oldham-based group, which came to the market in 1990, increased sales by
25 per cent to Pounds 22.2m. Underlying sales growth of UK healthcare
products was 9 per cent, but the group said this was partly depressed by a
policy of ending discounts and the second half was likely to show
double-digit growth.
Mr Ian Cater, chief executive, said: 'September was the best month we've
ever had.'
The healthcare division lifted sales by 30 per cent to Pounds 19.7m, mainly
because of acquisitions. Including these, sales to the UK pharmacy and
community sector advanced by 64 per cent, compared with increases of 5 per
cent to UK hospitals and 7 per cent in exports. Operating profits rose from
Pounds 2.14m to Pounds 2.87m.
The group made considerable progress in the integration of Cupal, the
Blackburn-based manufacturer of over-the-counter medicines, acquired last
December for Pounds 8.2m. The workforce had been reduced from 150 to 85 and
the sales forces had been merged to provide a team of 23, calling regularly
on more than 7,000 independent retail pharmacies and multiple chains.
Mr Cater said Cupanol, the paracetamol-based children's medicine for pain
and fever relief, was selling well and would be heavily promoted in the
autumn. The group was also developing new wound and bandaging products.
The sports and leisure division saw flat sales of Pounds 2.55m, and
operating profits slightly up at Pounds 348,000. Although conditions on the
high street were difficult, the group said it had recently launched a sports
care range and would benefit from any improvement in trading.
Gearing at the half-year was down from 80 to 21 per cent, following a Pounds
13.1m rights issue in November. Mr Cater said the group wanted to continue
growing by acquisition in its core areas.
Earnings per share rose by 22 per cent to 7.2p (5.9p). The interim dividend
is 1.9p (1.7p).
COMMENT
Seton quoted Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, to the effect
that 'self-medication is an idea whose time has come'. With the wind blowing
so strongly from that quarter, Seton's focus on OTC medicines seems timely,
and the group has built an impressive position in a market which is forecast
to increase by 50 per cent by 2000. The group has grown its previous
acquisitions well and the integration of Cupal suggests it also enjoying
benefits of scale on manufacturing and distribution. Forecast full-year
profits of just over Pounds 8m put the shares, up 9p yesterday to 310p, on a
prospective multiple of 17. That premium rating is justified by the group's
impressive track record since flotation at 130p per share, although any
further advance will be limited by its need to fund significant acquisitions
with more paper.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Attwoods loses Pounds 91m on Mindis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTWOODS, the waste manage-ment company where Laidlaw of Canada owns a 38
per cent stake, has sold Mindis, its US recycling business and made a Pounds
91m provision to cover the loss on disposal.
The sale of the loss-making subsidiary is confirmation of the difficulties
recycling companies have faced in the US and Europe in finding markets for
recycled materials.
The subsidiary is being sold for Dollars 40m (Pounds 26.4m) to a company in
which Mindis's chief executive and chief operating officer - who sold the
company to Attwoods in 1989 for Dollars 45m - have a significant interest.
Attwoods had invested more than Dollars 100m dollars in Mindis since the
purchase.
Mindis has suffered for two years from weak markets for recycled materials
and a collapse in prices for the base metals it recycles.
The announcement comes only days after the announcement of the resignation
of Laidlaw's chief executive, Mr Donald Jackson, whose tenure has been
dogged by the group's investments in Attwoods and its 24 per cent stake in
ADT, the security and car auction company.
Laidlaw last night announced the appointment of a chief executive, Mr James
Bullock, formerly chief executive of Cadillac Fairview, a Toronto-based
property developer.
The changes at the top of Laidlaw have prompted speculation that the group,
which is 47 per cent owned by Canadian Pacific, might now consider selling
its stake in ADT and restructure its waste management interests in North
America.
As a result of the provision for Mindis, Attwoods reported a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 62.21m in the year to July 31, down from a profit of Pounds 25.10m,
on sales up 20 per cent at Pounds 409.97m.
The loss per share was 25.25p, compared with earnings of 6.84p, and the
group is paying a 3.25p final dividend, giving a maintained 5p for the year.
Attwoods said its ongoing businesses were doing well and would have led to
an increase in earnings per share before Mindis, if an exceptional Pounds
5.4m foreign exchange gain was included.
Pro-forma gearing after the sale of Mindis will be 49 per cent excluding the
preference shares which the company says its bankers consider as equity - up
from 36 per cent a year ago.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Search is on for new Groupe Bull head to replace Pache
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE and ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH government is searching for a replacement for Mr Bernard Pache,
chairman and chief executive of Groupe Bull, the loss-making computer
manufacturer, according to sources close to the government.
Groupe Bull yesterday refused to comment on a report in Les Echos, the
business newspaper, that Mr Pache was shortly to be replaced.
The newspaper report follows months of speculation in Paris that Mr Pache's
job was at risk.
Mr Pache, 58, ex-head of the French coal board, was appointed by the former
left-wing government in June last year with a remit to return Bull to
profitability and prepare it for privatisation.
One senior French businessman with experience of the computer industry said
yesterday that it would be 'crazy' to dismiss Mr Pache after such a short
period in office or to replace him with somebody from outside the industry.
The newspaper report said Mr Pache's departure might be announced in
conjunction with the publication of the group's recovery plan. The plan is
expected to include a request for FFr9.2bn (Dollars 1.6bn) of state aid.
Speculation about a successor has mentioned Mr Jean-Marie Descarpentries,
former head of the French packaging company Carnaud, who engineered the
merger with Metal Box of the UK. He was offered the job at the time of Mr
Pache's appointment, but turned it down.
Some argue that Mr Pache has incurred government displeasure by moving too
slowly to transform and revitalise Bull, which has lost FFr15bn in the past
three years.
It is a time of intense uncertainty for the senior management of France's
state-controlled companies. The Balladur government has already made two new
appointments. Mr Michel Pebereau has replaced Mr Rene Thomas as chairman of
Banque Nationale de Paris and Mr Philippe Jaffre has succeeded Mr Loik Le
Floch-Prigent at the Elf Aquitaine oil group.
Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, chairman of Credit Lyonnais, the troubled banking
group, is mooted as the next target. He is expected to move to Credit
National, another bank, to make way for Mr Jean Peyrelevade, currently
chairman of the Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP) insurance group.
The appointment of a French government usually triggers a round of corporate
changes as the new administration exercises its right to hire and fire the
heads of France's public sector companies. However the current round has a
particular importance because of the privatisation programme. The Balladur
government is anxious to ensure that the privatisation candidates move into
the private sector with its own sympathisers in charge.

FT  14 OCT 93 / ICI adds to its explosives division
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries, the UK's biggest chemicals concern, has
reinforced its presence in the civil explosives industry by acquiring a 51
per cent stake in AECI Explosives of South Africa.
The deal is an asset swap in which ICI exchanges a 25 per cent stake in
AECI, a South African petrochemicals, paints and agricultural products
company, for majority control of AECI's explosives business. ICI retains a
13.3 per cent stake in AECI.
Mr Bob Clarke, chief executive of ICI Explosives, described the deal as 'the
most important step in ICI Explosives for many years'. The deal adds a
business with sales of Pounds 150m-Pounds 200m to the division which last
year had a turnover of Pounds 573m.
AECI's explosives operations, which supply the construction and mining
industry, have trading margins just below the 10 per cent achieved by ICI's
existing explosives operations. The swap adds 5,000 people to ICI's
workforce.
Mr Rob Margetts, ICI board director, said: 'Now sanctions have been dropped
we expect to export significant quantities from South Africa.'
The deal was part of ICI's strategy to focus resources on global businesses
in which the company could be a leader, said Mr Margetts. It reinforced
ICI's position as the leading manufacturer of civil explosives, he added.
The petrochemicals operations which the British company has divested in the
swap are not core activities.
The new holding company of AECI will be Anglo American Industrial
Corporation which previously held a 38 per cent stake.
Mr Mike Sander, AECI managing director, said the joint venture would be
strengthened by an enhanced capability to meet international competition and
by improved access to foreign markets and investment opportunities.
Mr Sander added that the deal would also help AECI in its effort to create
strong, self-standing businesses. AECI is South Africa's leading supplier of
chemicals and related products. After difficult years in 1991 and 1992, AECI
lifted net profits in the first half of 1993 by 50 per cent to R75m (Pounds
14.5m).
