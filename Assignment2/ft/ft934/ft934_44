FT  14 OCT 93 / Bells ring for prophets of information age: Martin Dickson
reports on the merger of Bell Atlantic with TCI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two prophets of the coming age of interactive multi-media communications
joined forces yesterday to exploit an information revolution which promises
to transform America - and eventually the world.
Bell Atlantic, the 'Baby Bell' regional telephone company which serves the
middle Atlantic seaboard of the US, announced plans for an agreed takeover
of Tele-Communications Inc, the largest cable TV company in the US, serving
more than 20 per cent of America's cable homes.
Bell Atlantic, led by Mr Raymond Smith, 55, has been the most active of the
seven 'Baby Bell' local phone companies in preparing for an interactive
multi-media world.
TCI's 52-year-old head Mr John Malone - who will become vice-chairman of the
enlarged Bell Atlantic - is also a tireless proponent of this brave new
world. The pair's shared vision of the future played a key role in prompting
the deal. Both described it as the 'perfect information age marriage'.
If it survives regulatory scrutiny, the deal will be the most far-reaching
in a series of link-ups between US cable television and telephone companies
since the start of the year.
Over the next few years, households will be able to call up on a television
set a vast array of information and entertainment, together with video
telephone calls - although it remains uncertain how much consumers are ready
to pay for this.
Both the telephone and cable television industries have wires running into
most US homes. The convergence of the two sectors at one time looked like
provoking a furious battle, but instead the two are getting together. They
have realised that each brings complementary skills to the extremely costly
task of supplying the new technology to the consumer.
The local telephone companies have much deeper pockets than the cable
companies, as well as skills in switching complex two-way traffic. The TV
companies' co-axial cable offers a much broader conduit to the home than
telephone copper wires; and the cable companies have skills in distributing
programmes which the telephone companies lack.
Until now, the biggest link-up between the two industries was an agreement
whereby US West, the Baby Bell telephone company serving the Rocky Mountains
and Northwest, paid Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.65bn) for a 25 per cent stake in
the entertainment production and cable arm of Time Warner, the country's
second largest cable service provider.
Yesterday's deal carries the trend to its logical conclusion with a proposal
for a full-scale merger. It seems certain to provoke a rash of imitations as
other telephone and cable companies scramble to position themselves for the
new age.
However, the merger between Bell Atlantic, whose turnover of around Dollars
13bn makes it the third largest Baby Bell, and TCI should give these two
companies a powerful position in setting technical standards and gaining
market share. This is partly because it is the first full merger, involving
such large players, and partly because of the energy of the two companies
and the men who run them.
The Baby Bell companies - spun off from long-distance carrier American
Telephone and Telegraph in 1984 under a court-ordered anti-trust settlement
 -have tended to inherit the culture of monopolistic utilities.
Under Mr Smith, Bell Atlantic has tried particularly hard to become more
entrepreneurial, and has emerged as the most aggressive Baby Bell in trying
to enter the multi-media industry. In August, it became the first US
telephone company allowed to offer video services in its own telephone
service area, when it successfully challenged a section of the 1984 cable
television act which prevented this.
It is also one of the largest players in the US cellular telephone industry,
cementing its position two years ago with the Dollars 1.6bn acquisition of
the Metro Mobile service. Earlier this week it moved into the Mexican
market, paying Dollars 1bn for 42 per cent of carrier Grupo Iusacell.
As for TCI, in 20 years Mr John Malone has transformed it from a rag-tag mix
of small, poorly capitalised cable operations into an industry leader. It
announced plans last week to re-merge with Liberty Media, a large cable
programming company which it spun off in 1991 because of regulatory
concerns.
Liberty in turn owns a large stake in QVC Network, a home shopping channel
which is making a hostile Dollars 9.5bn bid for entertainment group
Paramount Communications - in competition with an agreed Dollars 7.5bn deal
from rival cable group Viacom.
All these factors mean that yesterday's deal will come under intense
regulatory scrutiny.
Bell Atlantic, which is not allowed to own cable systems in its own area,
will spin off TCI's overlapping cable operations into a separate company.
But its acquisition of TCI's and Liberty's programming interests is subject
to review by the courts, and Congress will also be keenly interested in a
deal which could set the model for US local phone companies of the future.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Capel team defects to Morgan Grenfell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORGAN Grenfell, the UK merchant bank, has recruited about 20 equity
traders, analysts and sales staff from rival James Capel to beef up its
developing country debt and bond operations. The mass hirings boost Morgan
Grenfell's emerging markets headcount by roughly 20 per cent to about 120
and are a testimony to the growing importance of emerging market
investments. The new team gives Morgan Grenfell an entree into the vibrant
emerging market equity business.
The departures, which started a couple of weeks ago, have cut a swathe
through Capel's emerging markets operations in London and New York, more
than halving the staff on the trading, sales and research side. Capel said
18 staff from offices in London, New York, Mexico, and Hong Kong - mostly
covering Latin American equities - had formally quit.
The company, which is a subsidiary of HSBC Holdings, has shifted staff from
its international equities operations to plug the gaps and plans to
're-orient the focus of the team towards Asia' where it claims a competitive
advantage through its parent.
Morgan Grenfell expects the new recruits, who include Mr Jonathan Binder,
head of emerging markets sales in New York and a former Morgan Grenfell
employee, and Mr Mark Donegan, head of the sales force in London, to join by
the beginning of December. The two are bringing most of their sales teams
with them. Morgan Grenfell indicated that recruitment was still going on.
Mr Rick Haller, head of Morgan Grenfell's emerging markets operations, said:
'We are one of the top three traders worldwide of emerging market debt.'
According to one estimate, Morgan Grenfell turns over Dollars 10bn (Pounds
6.6bn) of debt and bonds a month. But its operations have until now lacked
muscle on the equity side.
Increasingly, those international investors interested in emerging markets
want to buy both debt and equities for their portfolios. 'What you are
finding in the emerging markets is that if an institution likes the country
story they buy everything,' said one specialist at Morgan Grenfell.
The UK merchant bank, which trades on its own account as well as for clients
in emerging market debt, said two Latin American funds had shot up in value
since their launch last year.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Telecoms privatisation halted by Papandreou
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE NEW Greek Socialist government yesterday announced it would cancel the
partial privatisation of the telecommunications company OTE, raising fears
about the future of other sell-offs planned by the former conservative
government.
Mr Andreas Papandreou, whose Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) won back
power in Sunday's general election, made the announcement on television at
the start of his new cabinet's first meeting. Mr Papandreou had claimed
during the election campaign that Pasok was now committed to co-operating
with the private sector and to liberalising further Greece's financial
markets.
The previous conservative government had also earmarked two state-owned oil
refineries for sale this year although plans were only at an early stage. A
series of commercial plans, including the award of new casino licences and
several development projects are also now in doubt.
The telecommunications law, passed two months ago, provided for the sale of
49 per cent of OTE. Negotiations started earlier this year with six
international operators shortlisted to buy a strategic 35 per cent stake in
the company.
Preparations were also under way to float OTE on the Athens stock exchange
with the sale of 10 per cent of the company to the public and 4 per cent to
employees. A group of international merchant banks, including Credit Suisse,
First Boston, J. Henry Schroder Wagg and NM Rothschild, Morgan Stanley and
Paribas Capital Markets, were handling the flotation. CSFB was also advising
on the strategic sale.
Pasok sources said agreements with several foreign merchant banks chosen by
the conservative government were being terminated.
Mr Gerry Grimstone, a corporate finance director at J. Henry Schroder Wagg,
the merchant bank which had been appointed to handle the offer to the public
of shares in OTE, said the bank had not yet received instructions from the
Greek government.
However, Mr Evricos Sarsentis, a Greek analyst at J. Henry Schroder Wagg,
said Schroder hoped the flotation would still go ahead.
Neither Schroders nor NM Rothschild, which has been advising the Greek
government on the privatisation programme as a whole, are expected to sue
the government for breaking their contracts. One banker said: 'It is all
part of the rich tapestry of investment banking.'

FT  14 OCT 93 / Prospects fade for BAe jet deal with Taiwan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DENNIS ENGBARTH and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECTS for a successful conclusion to talks between British Aerospace
and Taiwan Aerospace on a joint venture to build regional jets receded
further yesterday when Taiwan admitted that difficulties over the deal had
shown that it needed a new aerospace industry strategy.
Mr Chiang Ping-kun, industry minister, said that when the original deal was
struck in January 1993, 'there wasn't any strategy. It wasn't conducted by
experts. The banking specialists weren't involved, for example'.
Taiwan wants to enter the civil aviation sector as part of its industrial
policy. But in recent months, opposition politicians and some Taiwanese
banks lending money to Avro, the joint venture company, have argued against
the deal on commercial grounds and the government had stepped in to try to
save it.
Mr Chiang repeated that the government would take no more direct part in the
deal, but added that the proposed venture might go ahead. The decision would
be taken by BAe and TAC, he said.
The collapse of the joint venture would undermine the UK company's strategy
for improving profits and threaten the jobs of 4,000 BAe staff, mostly in
Woodford, Cheshire.
BAe said it believed that a deal was still possible. However, its attempts
for the past week to restart talks have been fruitless.
Talks are unlikely to be reconvened before a TAC board meeting next Tuesday
when one of three outcomes was likely, Mr Chiang said. The board could
declare the deal dead, it could 'strive for better conditions under the
existing structure' of the agreement or it could call for the basic contract
to be renegotiated.
BAe has in the past warned that the January contract meant that TAC had
legal obligations and could not pull out without consultation.
The differences between the two sides concern BAe's commitment to a new
generation of aircraft that would be more suited to Asian markets than the
RJ series, which was designed in the 1970s. TAC wants such a commitment
while BAe insists that the joint venture be finalised before a study is
conducted.
Mr Chiang said that whatever happened his ministry would now formulate a new
plan for the aerospace sector.
BAe is expected to announce today the loss of 460 jobs at its Jetstream
turboprop plant in Prestwick, Scotland. The plant employs a total of 2,500.
Another 170 on-site subcontractors will also lose their jobs as part of the
company's cost-cutting review.

FT  14 OCT 93 / EC will propose tariff cuts to break trade talks deadlock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community is to propose cuts in tariff protection for
manufactured goods in an attempt to break the deadlock in Uruguay round
negotiations on global trade liberalisation.
The initiative, announced by Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, came
during a day of talks with Mr Mickey Kantor, his US counterpart.
Mr Kantor said the proposed cuts were 'not yet satisfactory. We need more,
not simply be-cause the US needs it, but be-cause we don't think other
countries will improve their offers on tariff cuts until they see more
movement'.
But Mr Kantor praised Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who made a strong
appeal in Paris yesterday for open markets during a meeting with Mr Edouard
Balladur, France's prime minister. The US trade representative said that
'increasing competition rather than building a wall around Europe' was an
absolute necessity.
Rejecting French demands for changes in the Blair House agreement between
the US and the EC on limiting Europe's subsidised farm exports, Mr Kantor
said: 'We are not going to reopen or renegotiate the Blair House agreement.'
The EC initiative offering further tariff cuts comes in response to growing
frustration that there is no detailed progress on market opening deals
reached in Tokyo in July by leaders of the Group of Seven industrial powers.
Sir Leon called for a special ministerial meeting of the Quad - which groups
Japan, Canada, the US and the EC - to resolve disagreements on the July
commitments.
Mr Kantor yesterday gave conditional support for the special Quad meeting,
insisting that 'further progress' was needed in negotiations before such a
meeting would be helpful.
Talks with the EC continue today. The EC has held back its tariff offer in
the hope of winning further market opening concessions from Japan and the
US. As a result, it has faced a barrage of criticism from trading partners
over the present paucity of its offer, which averages an estimated 26 per
cent tariff cut. By comparison, Japan's current offer amounts to 60 per
cent, Canada's to 50 per cent and the US to 37 per cent.
An EC official said yesterday the new schedule of tariff cuts, to be
proposed in Geneva tomorrow during an important stocktaking meeting of all
Uruguay round participants, would raise the average EC cut above 33 per
cent.

FT  14 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Unilever
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 1.6 per cent bounce in Unilever's shares yesterday in response to perky
sales predictions from Procter &amp; Gamble provides another illustration of how
closely UK consumer product stocks have shadowed their US peers this year.
The rekindling of positive sentiment towards the US soap suds industry was
strong enough to over-ride worries that P&amp;G's gains were being made at
Unilever's expense.
The striking correlation in share price performance between the two sectors
is puzzling, however, given that none appeared to exist in the 1980s.
Marlboro Friday has set the tone for both markets. Talk of the food
industry's long-term secular decline has spread in New York and London. Both
national sectors have suffered in common as defensive stocks have fallen out
of fashion. Both, too, have faced similar problems with sluggish recovery,
rampant retailers, and the turn of the margin cycle.
Attention on both sides of the Atlantic is focusing on those companies which
can evade such pressures by generating sustainable earnings in emerging
markets. Both Nestle and Unilever are well placed to benefit from this
perception. The challenge for both will be to stabilise margins in Europe
and the US while driving growth elsewhere. As the industrial heir to two
colonial empires, the Anglo-Dutch company may have a particular historical
advantage. Nestle, though, has been driving especially hard in the Far East.

FT  14 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Generale des Eaux
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Not long ago Generale des Eaux seemed to cast its substantial shadow across
the UK water industry. A number of smaller water-only companies still fall
within its empire. But fears of a French invasion proved unfounded. As its
planned Ffr3bn-4bn rights issue shows, Generale has its hands full
elsewhere. Proceeds will cover perhaps three years capital investment in
SFR, which holds one of two digital cellular phone licences in France.
Construction and property interests have been mauled by recession at a time
of rising capital spending, so gearing will be well over 100 per cent even
after the capital increase.
Generale will have little incentive to look again at the UK's privatised
water companies after takeover restrictions are lifted at the end of next
year. The attraction to any potential bidder will depend on price limits set
by the regulator for the second half of the decade. Even on the most
optimistic assumptions, though, water bills will not rise fast enough to
cover investment. That could be an effective poison pill against a predator
facing substantial calls on capital elsewhere.
Nor does Generale need a UK water acquisition for earnings growth. Its
investment in telecoms should start to pay off in the middle of the decade
and lower French interest rates will cut the cost of servicing its debt
mountain. Its existing French and international water interests look capable
of delivering decent profits growth, without the bother of UK-style
regulation.

FT  14 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest UK price and production figures appear to illustrate the dilemma
facing the chancellor. If the economy is weak, the argument goes, he cannot
easily put up taxes in November. But with the underlying rate of inflation
at 3.3 per cent, it also seems risky to cut interest rates. It would be
acutely embarrassing if the underlying rate subsequently moved to the top of
the 4 per cent target ceiling, or even above it. The government's desire to
avoid this may even dampen enthusiasm for higher VAT charges, which only
increase the headline rate of inflation.
One reading of yesterday's data is that a budget of minimal change is
becoming more likely. In the short term that might please the equity market,
which, having enjoyed a sharp rebound in earnings so far this year, is
starting to worry about whether the momentum can be sustained into 1994. But
it would only leave the job of correcting the PSBR to later.
In fact there may still be sense in a more radical shift in policy mix at
the time of the budget. Manufacturing output is not weak because of poor
consumer demand. Rather it is investment goods which have been hit, while
weak European markets are holding back exports too. The most helpful
palliative would be for lower continental interest rates. Failing that a
slightly lower pound might secure some market share for British exporters.
Higher tax on individuals offset by lower interest rates would assist
industry while having some disinflationary benefit into the bargain.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hollywood was not mentioned once in Bell Atlantic's statement about its
merger with TCI, perhaps for fear of frightening the children. The deal has
many dimensions, and the expansion of cable television and its integration
with telephony was a powerful force bringing the companies together. But the
timing is important and Paramount is discernibly the ghost in the machine.
TCI owns over 20 per cent of QVC, which is bidding for Paramount. Having
looked a weaker competitor than Viacom, QVC suddenly has a merged Baby Bell
and large cable operator as its backer. If an improved bid is forthcoming
from QVC, Paramount's board can hardly swat it away.
The prize of the last footloose Hollywood studio feeding programmes into the
largest US cable network backed by a telephone company with the capital to
develop a large scale digital system has clearly turned executive heads.
Whether Bell Atlantic will ever make money from TCI is more questionable.
The price of 11.75 times cash flow is higher than the valuation of many
telecoms companies, but not wildly so. The 35 per cent first year dilution
of earnings is, however, a better indication of how much Bell Atlantic is
betting on the deal.
Yet valuation seems almost irrelevant to companies at this stage. A stake in
the few properties available in the fusing world of media and communications
is viewed as merely the ante which buys admission to the multi-media poker
game. No one can yet discern the final shape of the industry which will
emerge, and the risk of buying the wrong companies at the wrong price is
high. When this kind of money is changing hands, not even apparently
impregnable stars like Disney are safe.

John Tusa does have the knack of bouncing back. Never given sufficient
credit for how he ran the BBC World Service, he was then denied the chance
to apply for the director-generalship of the BBC. Now he has quit as Master
of Wolfson College after less than a year.
But the academic spat at Cambridge University was last week. This week Tusa
becomes chairman of the advisory committee for the government art
collection.
His new influence extends, therefore, to all 15,000 works of mainly British
art which adorn the walls of government offices and British embassies.
At nearly-new Wolfson College, one of Tusa's many frustrations was the fact
that there was no room for modern art in the master's dining room and
elsewhere, because of all that space devoted to portraits of ancient
academics.
Described by one friend as 'pathologically decisive', Tusa would have had
exceptionally little patience with academic dithering. Watch out for some
fast thinking, though, on how to enliven the walls of Whitehall.

A refreshing antidote to publishers' hype reaches Observer from the
Behavioral Sciences Research Press in Dallas.
A recent survey has been concentrating on 'what makes British sales people
hit the road, pick up the phone and go for the close day after day?'
According to the two behavioural scientists who have been out on the road
themselves, 37 per cent of British sales people are mainly motivated by
money - the same proportion, it emerges, as in the US.
Even more 'interesting', the taster for the research goes on, only 20 per
cent of Canadians are driven by such considerations - 'despite also being
former royal subjects and America's closest neighbors'.
So what accounts for these cultural differences? 'We don't know,' the
authors respond with disarming honesty.

<TEXT>
While small investors don't normally cause much of a stir in Zurich, a
plague of them has lately rocked the city's public transit system by
cleaning up profits of about 7,000 per cent on each minuscule outlay.
Their bonanza began with the discovery that a Russian one rouble coin, worth
about 2p, is the same size as a Swiss five franc piece, representing over
Pounds 2.30.
Hence by using a rouble to buy a cheap ticket from the system's vending
machines, they netted change in francs worth about Pounds 1.40.
Transit authority director Rolf Kunzle says the rouble trouble, which began
in February, has cost the system nearly Pounds 56,000. But the machines have
now been fixed to take neither five franc coins nor roubles pending
development of an automatic way of discriminating between them.
An added worry initially was whether the change agents were coming in from
Russia or local gnomes corrupted by the massive margins.
The question was resolved, however, when police arrested three Russians
equipped with sacks of rouble coins and a map of the transit network.

Kenneth Baker may not have enjoyed glowing reviews of his memoirs, but at
least his remarks about Sir George Jefferson are suitably diplomatic.
As minister for information technology in the early 1980s, one of Baker's
first tasks was to oversee the privatisation of British Tele-com.
In the first appearance he makes in the memoirs, Kenneth Baker The Turbulent
Years, My Life in Politics, Jefferson, then chairman of BT, is described as
'very co-operative', even if 'he was irked by having to come and see me
about quite trivial matters'.
Jefferson may remember the ultimately fairly successful battles over the
shape of post-privatisation BT somewhat differently.
Anyway, it will be Baker who is coming to see him, now that the former
cabinet minister has joined the UK board of Videotron, the
Canadian-controlled cable company, of which Jefferson is chairman.
One of the largest operators in the UK, Videotron wants Baker aboard because
he 'kicked off the whole cable business' - and forgives him entirely for the
inaccuracy of his 1982 prediction that multi-channel cable TV would be in
every British household before the end of the decade.
At any rate, Baker is now in a position to roll up his sleeves and hasten
the advent of the wired city.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Uncle Sam in retreat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ONCE THE Soviet Union disappeared, the US was left in sole possession of the
cold war battlefield. The machinery of the United Nations was at its
disposal. The world looked, with varying degrees of hope and anxiety, to see
what use it would make of its victory.
Inevitably a debate broke out among the American 'foreign policy community'.
Some favoured a unilateral assumption of world leadership, using American
power to promote good and punish evil, recruiting allies where available but
never sacrificing the country's freedom to decide for itself when and where
its power should be used. Others stressed the need for a multilateral
approach, placing American power at the service of the world community and
using it only for purposes approved by a broad international consensus, in
conformity with international law. A third school sought to downgrade
foreign policy altogether, arguing that the disappearance of the Soviet
threat permitted America at last to lavish attention on its many domestic
problems.
Mr George Bush was somewhere between the first and the second schools, and
his successor is somewhere between the second and the third. Not himself,
strictly speaking, an isolationist, Mr Bill Clinton had no compunction about
exploiting popular resentment against Mr Bush's apparently exclusive concern
with foreign policy; and he would not have been elected had not Mr Ross
Perot, with a much more crudely isolationist message, taken a large share of
Mr Bush's vote.
Once elected, Mr Clinton recruited many foreign policy specialists to advise
him, most of whom inclined towards the multilateralist school of thought.
Underlying ambivalence
Yet, partly because they are not confident about carrying either the public
or the president with them, there remained an underlying ambivalence. The US
wanted to work through the UN and other multilateral institutions, but
always on the assumption that it would be in the lead - not only
politically, but also in the sense of having command of any combat
operations in which its troops were involved.
This version of multilateralism is hard to sustain, because it means asking
something of the US's partners which the US itself is not prepared to grant.
It also leads to confusion about where the responsibility for policy
decisions actually lies. In Somalia, many UN officials feel they have been
effectively commandeered as extras in a film produced and directed by
Americans. Yet US policy-makers have blithely put the blame on the UN for
things that have gone wrong.
Serious resistance
That things have gone wrong neither side now seriously disputes. But the
damage extends far beyond Somalia itself. The whole notion that the UN can
bring order into parts of the world afflicted by chaos has been discredited.
The remarkable success of the simultaneous, but much more carefully planned,
and much more genuinely multilateral, operation in Cambodia has been
eclipsed. To much of the world the UN has been portrayed as a mere tool in
the hands of a blundering and arrogant superpower, instinctively inclined to
tackle all problems with a show of military force, yet ready to back off as
soon as it encounters serious resistance. To the US public, the UN has been
proved a dangerous will o'the wisp, luring idealistic American soldiers to a
humiliating and pointless death.
The result has been a loss of nerve among the multilateralists in the State
Department, the Pentagon, and the National Security Council, and a
reassertion of Mr Clinton's own instinctive reluctance to get bogged down in
complex foreign policy issues. Already, when he addressed the UN general
assembly last month, he was clearly multiplying the conditions that had to
be met before the US would involve itself in further peacekeeping or
'peacemaking' operations. The chances of US troops being sent to Bosnia,
never very great, are now virtually zero. From now on, the US is unlikely to
risk its forces in any conflict where there is not a direct and more or less
self-evident threat to its national interests. Those who believed the cold
war would be followed by a period of Pax Americana, worldwide or even in
Europe, need to think again, and urgently.

FT  14 OCT 93 / A painstaking restoration: Improved industrial
competitiveness is crucial for east Germany's economic recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government of the east German state of Saxony is carefully restoring the
Frauenkirche in Dresden, one of Germany's most beautiful baroque churches,
bombed by the British in February 1945 and left in ruins for four decades.
Work is expected to last until 2006.
Three years after German unification, a similar process of slow
restructuring is taking place in the east German economy.
The Bundesbank, in its latest monthly report, has recorded the first sign of
sustained growth, with manufacturing - hardest hit by the radical upheavals
of the last three years - finally showing rising orders and production.
But compared with the Frauenkirche, the reconstruction of east Germany is
less balanced and less secure. While east Germany started from a much lower
base, it has, like west Germany, suffered from the unfavourable global
economic environment. Also hitting production has been the rapid
introduction of the D-Mark and the collapse of markets elsewhere in eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union.
Large-scale transfers from west Germany, totalling around DM180bn (Pounds
73bn) this year, have been needed to make up the gap between what east
Germans spend and what they earn. Total east German demand is almost double
domestic output as measured by gross domestic product. If east German living
standards are to be maintained, funding of this magnitude - amounting to
about 5 per cent of west German GDP - will be needed for the next decade or
so.
At least, though, the east German economy is now growing. In 1992 growth was
7 per cent and is expected to be about the same this year.
Particularly important in sustaining that growth has been the buoyancy of
the construction industry, even though the rate of increase has slowed
recently. A third of 1993's transfers from west Germany will be channelled
into infrastructure projects. The impact is obvious in the improved quality
of roads, the water network and telecommunications.
Also showing fast growth in the last three years have been family-based
workshops, representatives of the Handwerk craft enterprises which are
common in west Germany. Economic liberalisation created both a demand and
supply of small-scale businesses and 870,000 such enterprises have been set
up since unification. The Association for German Craftsmen, which represents
these businesses, believes they contribute about 7 per cent of east
Germany's total output - but, because of difficulties in measuring their
contribution to GDP, official growth figures probably underestimate their
impact.
Yet the buoyancy of construction, services and small businesses is not
enough to propel eastern Germany towards a self-sustained recovery. If east
Germany is to become economically competitive - within Germany or abroad -
the future of the manufacturing and industrial sectors will be critical.
Large swathes of eastern Germany's under-capitalised manufacturing sector,
which, before unification, contributed about 70 per cent of the region's
GDP, have been forced to close because they were uncompetitive. There were
two main reasons. First, monetary union led to a rapid escalation of both
costs for manufacturers and output prices. Second, the demise of Comecon,
the socialist trade bloc, deprived eastern Germany of markets which before
1990 had accounted for more than 75 per cent of eastern Germany's exports.
Since unification, the Treuhand agency, charged with privatising and
restructuring east German industry, has embarked on a radical programme. Of
the 13,000 enterprises under its control, more than 10,000 have been sold,
2,500 closed, and 500 are being prepared for privatisation.
But the performance of the newly privatised sector has been disappointing.
Mr Heiner Flassbeck, chief economist at the Berlin-based German DIW
Institute for Economic Research, says a typical enterprise is making losses
equivalent to about 30 per cent of annual turnover.
The main brake has been high wage levels. In March 1991 IG Metall, the
engineering trade union, together with former east German managers and west
German employers, agreed that wages in eastern Germany should reach west
German levels by 1994. But rising wages have stifled competitiveness.
Subsequently, the deadline has been extended to 1996.
Mr Thomas Mayer, chief economist at the Frankfurt office of Goldman Sachs,
the securities house, says the agreement has held back much-needed
efficiency gains. He estimates productivity in eastern German industry is
about 65 per cent below western German levels, while wages in the east are
about 70 to 80 per cent of those in the west. That makes unit labour costs
about 70 per cent higher. 'This has had a debilitating effect on managers.
They have little room to manoeuvre,' he says.
But Mrs Birgit Breuel, head of the Treuhand, says high wage levels are not
the sole reason that east Germany's economy has not yet become
self-sustaining. She believes that its manufacturing companies need pump
priming in the form of investment and orders from west Germany and
elsewhere. 'The companies for which we are responsible have really improved
their quality. What they need is orders. At the moment they get the orders,
they increase their productivity immensely. But the (level of) orders they
receive is linked to the recession in western Germany.'
Despite the recession, the level of investment by western German companies
has been holding up, partly because such strategic decisions are taken years
in advance. But forecasts for next year are less optimistic. The
Munich-based Ifo Economic Forecasting Institute expects investment in
manufacturing in eastern Germany to rise by 15 per cent this year, but
forecasts a one-fifth decline in west German industry's investment in the
east's machinery and equipment next year.
Many economists believe that if east Germany is to attract sufficient future
investment, the region's current high level of federal grants for investment
and tax benefits will have to be maintained - and possibly wage restraint
introduced. According to the DIW, this year's federal subsidies to eastern
Germany, including grants, tax concessions, soft loans and subsidies by the
Treuhand, total DM50bn, or about 20 per cent of the region's GDP. These are
in addition to the federal transfers, which go direct to governments of the
eastern states.
Discontinuing such a high level of subsidy could hit companies in the west
as well as the east. Mrs Breuel says: 'If they (west Germans) do not give
orders to eastern German companies, the transfers will have to go on for a
long time. And they will have to be paid for by taxes.'
Adding to the burden on west Germany would be continuing high unemployment.
Before 1990, 92 per cent of the eastern German workforce was employed. Today
15 per cent of the 7.5m strong labour force is jobless. Taking account of
job creation schemes and short-time working, the real unemployment level is
at least 35 per cent.
Though high unemployment reinforces arguments for wage flexibility, the
adverse effect that breaking the link with west German wages would have on
living standards means the German government is looking more towards
continuing the subsidies and transfers in the hope of stimulating orders.
The fear of some economists is that eastern Germany might become a
'Mezzogiorno', a part of southern Italy that is heavily dependent on
transfers from the prosperous north.
Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, the prime minister of Saxony, disagrees. 'The whole
comparison with a Mezzogiorno is absolute nonsense. We are reconstructing an
economy (in Saxony) that had the highest GDP per capita in all of Europe
immediately after 1918. It has a 200-year history of industrialisation. A
Mezzogiorno never had a combination of culture and industry.'
Despite Mr Biedenkopf's bold statements, there seems little likelihood of a
significant cut in transfers and subsidies from west to east in the next
decade. The growth that has taken root in some sectors will have to be
maintained and perhaps accelerated if reconstruction leading to a
self-sustaining economy is to keep pace with the rebuilding of Dresden's
Frauenkirche.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Innovation in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of the European Community's collaborative research policy, long
promoted by Brussels as the key to technological innovation and industrial
competitiveness, is in doubt. Germany, Britain and France are baulking at
the Ecu13bn in funding proposed for the next five years. If they stand firm,
the Council of Ministers may be drawn into political confrontation with the
European Parliament.
As the EC's biggest paymasters, the three governments are motivated chiefly
by financial considerations, while the Parliament's overriding interest is
in testing the expanded institutional powers conferred on it by the
Maastricht treaty. These circumstances are hardly conducive to constructive
debate on what the policy has actually achieved, and whether it merits
further support.
The evidence is far from conclusive. It is hard to be sure how far joint
programmes such as Esprit have yielded commercial results, since they mainly
support generic research, not the development of products for market. Most
independent observers agree, though, that they have helped increase the flow
of knowhow by stimulating contacts between academics and industry across
borders.
However, the programmes have conspicuously failed to prevent the Community's
deficit on high-technology trade from widening further in the past decade;
neither have they saved its indigenous computer and semiconductor
manufacturers from near-terminal decline. That these products are still made
in Europe is due largely to local investment by US and Japanese companies,
much of it prompted by EC trade barriers.
Wrong targets
This dismal record neither invalidates the case for EC research funding nor
implies that more cash would have produced a better outcome. The problem is
that policy has been directed at the wrong targets. Too much money has been
squandered on failed prestige projects such as high-definition television
and the Jessi microchip scheme, intended to nurture 'infant industries' and
equip European industrial champions to compete on world markets.
That has repeated the error of national policies which relied on
state-backed investment projects to foster big technological breakthroughs.
Insofar as these have produced any usable products, the only buyers have
usually been government monopolies, which were often the projects' sponsors
in the first place. Rarely have such policies helped companies compete on
open markets.
More important still, EC policy has failed to remove the biggest constraints
to innovation. Research and development has commanded so much attention
partly because it is the only element in the innovation process which can be
easily identified and acted on by policy. However, it is only a measure of
input. Its commercial value depends on how effectively it is converted into
industrial output.
Japanese techniques
That is a task for which companies are uniquely responsible. The rise of
Japan's export industries in the past 30 years owes much to their
effectiveness in assimilating technology originated abroad. Their ability to
do so has relied on highly integrated product development and manufacturing
systems which have encouraged company-wide involvement in the innovation
process.
Though European manufacturers have applied Japanese techniques in their
factories, few have yet extended them throughout their business. That is
true not just in electronics and information technology. Pharmaceuticals
excepted, companies in many other sectors have handicapped innovation
efforts by allowing big gulfs to develop between their central research
laboratories and production and marketing divisions.
The current emphasis in Europe on new management concepts designed to
enhance performance by tightening links between corporate disciplines is an
encouraging sign that renewed efforts are being made to catch up. EC and
national technology policies can help by investing in the science base,
encouraging the dissemination of knowhow and raising skill levels. But only
by its own efforts can industry ensure these assets are put to productive
use.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Personal View: Why arts need public money to flourish
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAMERON MACKINTOSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is depressing enough to read as ill informed and ill thought-out an
article as David Sawers's 'No case for subsidies to the arts' (Personal
View, September 30), but the realisation that he is an economic consultant
writing for the Institute of Economic Affairs fills one with alarm.
The fact is that the commercial and subsidised theatre have been totally
interdependent for many years. The reason the British theatre is the envy of
the world, both artistically and financially, is that, since public money
went into revitalising regional theatre from the 1950s onwards, a tremendous
talent base has developed through the network of subsidised theatre
companies across the UK, where actors, directors, designers, technicians and
managements learn their craft.
It is misleading to say unsubsidised theatres still account for the majority
of the audience. Most UK theatres outside London's West End were built,
saved or funded by public money through the Arts Council and local authority
grants. Even those now in private hands were brought back from disrepair and
neglect during the 1960s and 1970s with public money and effort.
At any time, most of the plays and several of the musicals in the commercial
West End have come out of subsidised theatres. The international blockbuster
musicals which attract millions of people (and therefore earn many millions
in revenue) have nearly all been created by directors and designers whose
main professional experience has been in the subsidised theatre. The wide
choice of shows available in London and in theatres and concert halls around
the country generates a vast amount of money for the British economy. The
state tourist authorities in countries such as Australia and America have
calculated that, for each dollar spent at the theatre box office, on average
a further Dollars 2.70 is spent in the local economy through, for example,
travel, hotels and restaurants.
The arts are undoubtedly one of Britain's important industries and, unlike
most of its other industries, does not suffer from foreign competition. Its
only problem is one of under-funding, not over-funding as Mr Sawers thinks.
At this time the whole fabric of the British theatre is under threat from
government cuts. What is going to go to the wall is not the high-profile
theatre that Mr Sawers's 'richer classes' visit, but the grass roots of the
theatre that ordinary people need and support: Theatre in Education,
schools' programmes, flourishing regional theatres where Shakespearean
productions are properly cast, grants for drama students, etc - in fact, all
the areas where the next generation of productive talent and audiences will
come from.
When I started producing in the mid-1960s, the only way I could get a show
together financially was by working with a subsidised repertory theatre to
launch a tour. The majority of shows that my fellow producers and I put on
during our formative years came from state- and local authority-subsidised
theatres.
If there was no subsidised theatre, the choice of theatre available would
shrink dramatically. I am convinced that, contrary to Mr Sawers's opinion,
audiences would also shrink, because it is variety that stimulates both
artists and public alike. Popular musical shows such as Cats, Les Miserables
or Miss Saigon are only spectacular successes because they engage the
talents of such world-class directors as Trevor Nunn and Nicholas Hytner.
These directors' main body of work can only thrive in the subsidised sector,
where they can work on new and classic plays and great operas, properly cast
and realised on a scale to do justice to the author's work.
Whenever I visit America, people constantly bemoan the fact that there are
so few directors and designers coming through in the US to revitalise the
theatre, whereas Britain has a constant stream of new talent. The reason is
simple: the US does not have the fabric of subsidised theatre that the UK
does.
Subsidies give a cushion for learning and experiment, just as a commercial
company invests in the testing of a new product that may or may not go into
successful production. If all funding were put into the hands of local
authorities, we would indeed be in the situation Mr Sawers considers
undesirable, 'because it gives politicians and public servants the
opportunity to influence the development of the arts'.
At least the Arts Council, whatever its shortcomings, is a body whose only
purpose is to develop and nurture all the arts, and not a collection of
local politicians whose agendas may only peripherally include the arts.
Art has a much longer shelf life than commerce, and the UK cannot afford to
squander any more of its artistic fabric or it will disinherit future
generations.

TURMOIL AND TRIUMPH: My Years as Secretary of State
By George P Shultz Scribners, Pounds 25.95, 1,184 pages
In July 1982, George Shultz assumed office as US secretary of state. Leonid
Brezhnev was then general secretary of the Soviet Communist party. Following
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and the crackdown on Solidarity
in Poland in 1981, US-Soviet relations were virtually non-existent.
Moreover, the Soviet Union was on the diplomatic offensive, trying to split
Nato over deployment of intermediate range nuclear missiles on European
soil. And many were questioning the market model for economic development.
But when Shultz left office in January 1989 the opening of the Berlin Wall
was only months in the future.
In Turmoil and Triumph: My Years as Secretary of State, Shultz provides an
indispensable account covering, occasionally to the point of tedium, those
aspects of American foreign policy with which he concerned himself. It is
illustrative of how the approach of the US has changed that Shultz, a former
Treasury secretary and professional economist, appears virtually to have
ignored the economic aspects of international relations.
There is an ongoing debate among commentators and scholars about whether the
Reagan administration stepped up military spending in order to drive the
Soviet Union to bankruptcy. But there is no indication of such a plan in
Shultz's memoirs. Indeed, Shultz and the CIA believed an unrestrained
arms-race would favour the Soviets.
Because Shultz is writing of the end of the cold war, his treatment has been
compared with the magisterial account of the beginning of that struggle by
Dean Acheson, the most influential secretary of state since the second world
war. But the comparison with Acheson's Present At The Creation is unfair to
Shultz. For, although his writing is serviceable, Shultz is unable to match
the style and sense of drama of his predecessor.
During Acheson's period, the US had to develop a wholly new strategy to deal
with an expanding superpower. The response included the doctrine of
containment, the Marshall Plan and Nato. Shultz dealt with a simpler
situation - negotiating the end of a conflict with a declining superpower.
Shultz was required not to be creative but to show mastery over competing US
agency heads. Once Acheson received Truman's backing, the inter-agency
struggle was over. But Reagan's support did not settle a dispute; rival
barons would continue their obstruction.
In Shultz's portrayal, the chiefs of the various agencies concerned with
foreign affairs were, usually, dishonest, cut off from reality, or both.
William Casey's CIA was, justifiably, distrusted by Shultz because of its
ideological blindness, outright lying and lack of competence. The agency
insisted Gorbachev did not want to change the Soviet Union or that, if he
did, he could not. The national security adviser, William Clark, is
dismissed as having a limited grasp of substance. His successors - first
Robert McFarlane, then John Poindexter - are described as having
intentionally misled the secretary of state. Caspar Weinberger, secretary of
defence, generally opposed all negotiations with the Soviet Union.
Contrary to CIA analyses, Shultz believed the Soviet Union was declining and
that negotiations with it could be fruitful. The National Security Council
staff's answer to the question of contacts with the Soviet Union was 'ever a
resounding no'. Shultz considered the president 'a prisoner of his own
staff'. Yet Shultz obtained the president's approval for moving forward -
over the opposition of that staff, the secretary of de-fence and the
director of the CIA.
Shultz tempers loyalty to his president with fidelity to the facts. He
praises Reagan's 'visionary ideas', such as the strategic defence
initiative, but he reveals a detached president, devoid of analytical
ability, who believed what he wanted to believe. 'He would go over the
'script' of an event in his mind' and, once that script was mastered, that
was the truth; no fact, no argument, no plea for reconsideration could
change his mind.
A large portion of Shultz's account focuses on the Iran-Contra affair. Here,
Shultz is entitled to, and claims, a great deal of credit. There is no doubt
he opposed arms for hostages. Almost alone among the president's men, he
recognised there had been a 'rogue operation' which posed 'an immense
constitutional threat'. Nonetheless, a detailed review in the New York
Review of Books concluded that Shultz's account of Iran-Contra was
hopelessly 'distorted' and 'untrustworthy'.
Charles Hill, Shultz's former executive assistant, in what was surely an
authorised response, asserted the reviewer failed to understand 'that Shultz
confined his narrative to what he knew or was told at the time and excludes
information or any evidence which came to light after a decision or event
occurred'. According to Hill, this makes Turmoil and Triumph 'a unique,
irreplaceable and unchallengeable historical document, as it reveals a
reality that 'memoirs' invariably obscure: decisions of statecraft must be
taken on the basis of partial and sometimes erroneous reports'.
But the book gives no indication that it is confined to what Shultz was
aware of at any given time. If Mr Hill is correct on Shultz's approach, the
reader has not been given fair warning that Shultz's account of external
events may or may not be accurate.
On many occasions Shultz threatened to resign in response to the
manoeuvrings and inadequacies of colleagues. But he resisted this grand
gesture. We can be grateful that he soldiered on. His judgment was much
needed.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: How NHS bulb-changing activities came
to light
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW GREENE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Discussion of the current NHS light bulb saga, in the media and
elsewhere, is revealing a misunderstanding.
NHS staff and managers are finding that exhorting people to work harder and
faster when they are already fully stretched merely erodes morale, and any
gains in one department are obtained at the expense of other departments.
The light bulb-changing story, which applies to most other simple
maintenance activities, is typical. Such examples exist in hospitals all
over the world.
They are only turning up now because some hospitals, mainly trusts with
progressive managements, are starting to take a long, hard look at the way
they carry out their work, not just at how well they do what they have
always done.
So we should give those hospitals credit for re-engineering their work
habits, and urge the rest to do likewise.
Change should actually eliminate unnecessary work, not just allow the same
old tasks to be performed better or faster.
It can be a gold mine for the NHS, as it is proving in hospitals around the
world. And it can be shown to cut patient stays, reduce waiting lists,
improve standards of care, ease the work of staff, and give much better
customer service to patients.
While they by themselves are not going to solve the problem, the NHS and the
trusts at least deserve credit for what they are trying to achieve.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: The Channel tunnel and competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof RICHARD HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The impact of the Channel tunnel on the logistics industry ('Opinion
divided over tunnel', 5 October) may well be disputed. What is clear is its
minor, anticipated impact on company and industry competitiveness in those
regional markets whose relative accessibility is most likely to be affected.
A multi-sectoral study of the competitiveness implications of the tunnel has
recently been completed by the Centre for Management Research at the
University of Ulster.
Interviews with some 150 manufacturers in Northern Ireland, south-east
England, France and Belgium make it clear the tunnel, and the logistics
options it provides, will have little impact on companies' inter-regional
competitiveness. This is as true for peripheral companies serving southern
England and European markets as for companies located in those markets.
Non-price factors, notably product quality and design, and service
reliability, will continue to dominate.
What is particularly striking, and ultimately worrying in an assessment of
the long-term competitiveness of UK industry, is the reliance of continental
European companies competing in north European and UK regional markets, on
design, technical ability and quality for competitive edge.
UK companies remain reliant on straightforward price competitiveness. In
this context, the opening of the Channel tunnel is an irrelevance, which may
deflect attention from more fundamental concerns.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Economic Viewpoint: The folly of fussing about UK deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Those whom the gods wish to destroy they first make mad. Any god observing
the so-called UK economic debate will conclude that the self-destructive
wish is intense. Fortunately for the British economy its performance depends
much less on politicians and commentators than often supposed.
The merchants of gloom have enjoyed some genuine bad news in the Industrial
Production Index. It is best to take the manufacturing sector alone - simply
to remove the vagaries of North Sea oil output. Clearly, manufacturing
production in the three months to August was well down on the previous few
months. Its behaviour lends credence to much slighter signs from out-of-date
and unreliable trade figures that UK exports are being seriously hit by the
European recession. Even if the UK recovery is still continuing, it has lost
some of its wind.
What, however, would someone from Olympus think if, in the face of these
contractionary pressures, the British government depressed home demand
further by tax increases in the sacred name of cutting the budget deficit?
Other governments are being given the same advice. We thus could be on the
verge of a vicious circle of insanity, in which country A raises taxes or
cuts government spending because of its budget or balance of payments
deficit, thereby aggravating the deficits of countries B, C and D which make
cuts in their turn. Am I the only Keynesian left to perceive the folly of
this process? (My own break with Keynesian orthodoxy came on very different
issues.)
Nor is the folly confined to the tax side. The one common theme of all UK
assessments is how precarious any recovery still is in building and
construction. Yet the Treasury apparently regards the sector as a soft
target and is choosing this moment to try to withdraw concessions on local
authority and housing corporation expenditure.
Is there no one prepared to say that the analogy between the national budget
and a family one is more wrong than right, and that the function of a
national budget is precisely to offset the bias of private households and
companies: namely to move into surplus when the private sector is in a
spending mood and to go into deficit when the private sector is in a saving
one? The time horizon over which the public sector needs to come to an
appropriate balance - which is not zero - stretches over many more years
than would apply to a family or company.
The Treasury response would be that if tax increases proved too
contractionary, they could always be offset by interest rate cuts. The real
paperback memoirs just published (Nigel Lawson's) show that the official
Treasury's instinct has been to go for too low interest rates and too high
taxes. The leopard has not changed its spots.
The danger of cutting interest rates is that it might depress the exchange
rate - depending on what else was happening in the world. The Treasury does
not have freedom to do just what it likes on the interest rate front. Anyone
who thinks that the long-term ties linking world inflation, the exchange
rate and British inflation have been severed by leaving the European
exchange rate mechanism, has a shock coming.
A necessary reminder has been provided by the less favourable inflation
indicators, which should not be in the least bit surprising except to those
who were misled by the headline figures of the Retail Prices Index. Producer
output inflation (excluding foodstuffs) has risen for five consecutive
months, and now stands at 3 per cent compared with a year ago. The RPI,
excluding mortgage interest payments, now stands at 3.3 per cent compared
with a year ago.
These are still astonishingly low figures after a 12 per cent devaluation of
sterling and are only possible because of the world recessionary climate and
the pressure on UK pay and productivity resulting from two years of ERM
membership. The most encouraging factor is that, as the Treasury points out,
wage costs have fallen by the largest amount since records began in 1960.
Why put all this at risk with extra indirect tax increases, which will come
on top of the nearly 1 per cent addition to the Retail Prices Index already
in the pipeline next year from Norman Lamont's deferred tax rises?
It may at this stage be too late to advise Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor,
to rethink his tax increasing plans. So much political capital has been
invested in them that the markets might well take it as a weakness if they
were shelved.
The longer term
It is refreshing to move from these follies to a memorandum obtainable from
the Department of Trade and Industry. This has the unfortunate title of
Competitiveness but is in reality a survey of UK long-term performance. A
few of its charts are reproduced here.
They refute much of the widespread gloom and doom. Productivity for each
hour worked is only slightly higher in Germany than in the UK. In Japan, it
is a good deal lower. Only in the US - where there is also much
gloom-mongering - is productivity decisively higher. It is true that the UK
lags more in manufacturing, which accounts for a fifth of the total economy.
Business investment, for which the economic establishment has been crying
out for so long, is in fact as high as in the US and Germany. The gap here
is only with Japan, which is not necessarily a model.
The fall in the share of UK manufacturing exports in world trade dwindled to
a trickle in the mid-1970s (just when the Labour government was castigated
for going 'cap in hand to the International Monetary Fund'). It came to an
end in the early 1980s - which is one reason for taking the balance of
payments problem with a pinch of salt. The UK has also obtained the lion's
share of inward investment, not only from Japan but the US as well. There
has been no space for another chart showing the collapse of the strike
weapon in the British workplace.
Perhaps most important of all, and some evidence of the Thatcher
government's supply-side reforms, is that the return on capital has improved
so much; even in the current recession it is almost as high as it was in the
boom of the late 1970s.
Interestingly enough, the main weakness which emerges from the DTI paper is
one where the Treasury may be presumed to have had an influence. Inflation
was not only higher in the UK in the 30 years to 1990 than in all main
partner countries except Italy; but the year-to-year variation in inflation
was higher as well. This is demonstrated in more detail by a Bank of England
Working Paper.* Fluctuations in output, due to demand shocks, were also
greater in Britain than in most other countries, if one accepts the Bank
authors' analysis.
Whether the switch-back developments represent official stop-go or
hyperactive efforts to avoid stop-go is impossible to say. In any case, such
fluctuations were, together with inflation, the main preoccupation of the
British economic talking classes (mea culpa) for most of this time. Perhaps
one should end with Adam Smith's observation: 'There is an awful lot of ruin
in a nation,' which means that a country can put up with a great deal of
folly in its short-term management.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Tories must take blame for
unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HUGH MCCARTNEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Martin Wolf is mistaken ('Something's gotta give', October 2) with his
claim that 'it is untrue unemployment in the 1990s represents a specific
failure of Tory Britain. The UK has not done worse than continental
economies Labour so much admires'.
I hold no brief for any political party, but I must point out that Britain
has been the only country in the Community that is completely
self-sufficient in the various forms of energy. Today's Tory government must
take responsibility for the mass unemployment and massive imbalances in both
finance and trade after 14 years in office.
In addition, it is wrong to make such a dubious comparison, bearing in mind
the immeasurable effects of Germany's decision to unite, which has damaged
its economy and that of its neighbours so badly.
It cannot be gainsaid that, with all its advantages of energy and having
curbed the misused power of the unions, Britain should be leading the
European Community in prosperity instead of floundering in debt and
disunity.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER M BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Charity Commission has made it clear that charities can only
campaign as pressure groups on issues where they have direct experience as
care providers.
It thus seems unlikely that the recent report, recommending a division
between voluntary operations providing local or centrally funded care and
charities with no agency income, will provide the expected impetus for
pressure group and campaigning activities.
As care-providing charities offer an alternative delivery system to local or
central government units - which are effectively operating tax-free - it
will seriously restrict voluntary agencies if they have to price their
services after losing charity tax status.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Public dressed up as private
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RHODRI MORGAN MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your correspondent John Willman (October 7) effectively summarised the
problems now looming for the government in its attempt to implement its
Private Sector Initiative. This so-called 'big idea' for the 1990s is
intended to allow private finance and private sector expertise to be brought
in to build roads, railways, hospital car parks, etc - all previously public
sector preserves.
However, the government's experience of trying to keep the private sector to
a promise to provide 20 per cent of the funding for the Jubilee Line to
Canary Wharf and London's Docklands is no advertisement for the Private
Sector Initiative.
The government claims now to be in a position to give the go-ahead for the
Jubilee Line because the Pounds 400m private sector component of the total
cost of the Jubilee Line has now been agreed with the administrative
receivers of Canary Wharf and the creditor banks.
When you look closely at what had been agreed, however, it was clear that no
such private finance had been found. The 'front-end' component of the Pounds
400m had been reduced to Pounds 160m, which is fair enough. Nobody is really
interested in money that you have to spend after the year 2000.
The Pounds 160m, however, has not in the main come from the private sector
at all. Some Pounds 96m of it is coming from the European Investment Bank.
All of the European Investment Bank's money is government-guaranteed. That
is why it is available at a cheaper rate than private risk-bearing finance
would be in the international capital markets.
The government's Private Sector Initiative, if it follows the Canary
Wharf-Jubilee Line precedent, is really a classic piece of window dressing.
The public sector is simply renamed as the private sector, when it suits.
More power to the Jubilee Line elbow as far as I am concerned, but please
let's not pretend that it is being financed by the private sector.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Arts: 'MSM' by DV8 - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MSM at the Nottingham Playhouse is dance theatre about men having sex in
public lavatories. It takes its title from the psychologists' term for men
who have sex with men, and its material from 50 interviews collated by the
Physical Theatre Company, DV8. It represents a joint production between the
Nottingham Playhouse and the Royal Court Theatre. At 95 minutes, the piece
outstays its welcome, all gurgling cisterns and chance sexual encounters.
The action pieces together observations, confessions, stories and anecdotes
from the world of 'cottaging' where men meet sexual partners in public
lavatories. The dank brickwork and acrid disinfectant bring promise of
momentary satisfaction. The show starts with a man loitering outside, while
above and behind him, naked men appear in slow erotic entwinements. The
stage opens into the lavatory set. The design (Michael Howells) manages to
make the cubicles and dripping taps more than stage machinery. It allows the
seven actors to emerge over or through tiled walls, to hang upside down or
stretch languorously against the cool black partitions. The staging stays
unpredictable; panels open for a leg, hand or head to pop through into the
action. The porcelain hardware moves around, enabling the players to station
themselves ready for the baffling and subtle courtship manoeuvres.
The stories engage to a degree; but because they relate the interviewees
directly, they are short on the psychology of motivation: 'I'm so
desperate,' says one 35 year old, 'I run to get there quicker; I'm disgusted
with myself; I have sex with complete strangers.' The play never asks why.
Another nameless character says: 'Cottaging is ninety per cent waiting; if
you have patience, you can have a lot of fun; it was an escape from a
two-dimensional existence . . . it was exciting.' In which case, some
existence, some excitement. Another says: 'my best experience was in a
cubicle in Torremolinos', seeming sad rather than funny.
MSM is appropriately choreographed, with sensual slow figures and hanging
movements which stretch the male torso the way Renaissance painters did to
women. The physical action remains tense, controlled and pent up. The
director Lloyd Newson concludes with a requiem sequence suspended high over
the stage.
But the play never makes clear whether these men are to be praised for their
courageous honesty, or pitied for their addictive weakness. It lacks
political edge, never outlining the laws against sex in public places, and
only briefly touching on the health issues involved in massive promiscuity.
MSM also needs the psychological edge it claims in the programme notes,
preferring to shock with How? rather than ask with Why?
MSM tours through December 4 to: Edinburgh (Traverse Theatre, 031 228 7404),
Glasgow (Tron Theatre, 041 552 4267), Bristol (Wickham Theatre, 0272
303216), London (Royal Court Theatre, 071 730 1745), Zurich (Theaterhaus
Gessnerallee, 212 1220) and Munich (Marstall Theater, 49 892 1851)

THREE COLOURS BLUE (18) Krzysztof Kieslowski
TRUE ROMANCE (18) Tony Scott
RISING SUN (18) Philip Kaufman
THE SECRET GARDEN (U) Agnieszka Holland
THIS BOY'S LIFE (15) Michael Caton-Jones
What does it mean when a director gets an attack of Serial Cinema? Is it bad
for him? Should we try to help? It happened with Eric Rohmer, whose 'Moral
Tales' were followed by 'Tales And Proverbs' and 'Tales Of The Seasons' and
whose movies seem more and more like rent-a-theme fables with dwindling
variations. Now Poland's Krzysztof Kieslowski, having made ten films under
the sign of the Decalogue, promises three movies with colours as titles
begining with - that hue again - Blue.
Since each film in the French-made trilogy will also deal with a different
tricouleur-inspired theme - in Blue it is 'Liberty' - we feel attacked by
tags and flags, labels and gift-wrapping even before the credits start.
But after the annoyance, the masterpiece. After the signposting, a film
about living without signposts. A car crash; a husband and daughter killed;
and a survivor wife (Juliette Binoche) who wakes in hospital to a world
bearing down on her with bright lights and antiseptic concern.
Soon she is taking the approved path to rehabilitation. She exorcises her
grief - or tries to - by watching a video of her loved ones' funeral. She
swaps her manorial country pile for a town flat. (Her husband was a famous
composer.) And she takes with her an iconic memento of her past life - a
blue-crystal chandelier - like an inoculation to cure her of the disease of
memory.
But care-counselling is not the film's business. The man who made A Short
Film About Killing and The Double Life Of Veronique is not European cinema's
answer to Claire Rayner. Kieslowski soon hits Mlle Binoche with
bereavement's aftershocks. A litter of baby rats appears in her box-room -
in mocking parody of a vanished family life. And her dead husband rattles
his chains from the grave: first when she discovers a lost music manuscript
whose notes pursue her on the soundtrack even after she has thrown it in a
dust-van, later when she discovers her husband's bygone mistress.
Kieslowski's genius - and he may be the only European director now earning
that word - is for shuffling his deck of images so that animate and
inanimate become indistinguishable. Vivified by subtle colour filters or
skewed camera angles, trivial objects assume an eerie life: like the blue
lollipop, once her daughter's, that Binoche sucks on like a memory-teat.
Meanwhile human faces turn into mystery objects. Not least Binoche's own
luminous, frozen features, crossed by tiny shadows of emotion like a
snowbound mountain-face patrolled by changing clouds.
If Blue is about liberty, it is about the struggles we go through to achieve
that liberty. Liberty from memory, from grief. Liberty from the panaceas of
the well-meaning. Above all, liberty from the false comfort of lives we try
too neatly to compartmentalise, only to find that warmth, want and chaos
keep flooding in at the edges.
And in a good movie week, chaos will come again. True Romance is not so much
a film, more an advanced case of delirium tremens. But see if you can resist
its pop-art vitality. The paths of blonde call-girl Patricia Arquette and
lonely comics-store assistant Christian Slater cross in Detroit one night
when she spills her popcorn over him in a cinema. He says to her 'Accidents
will happen.' She says to him 'What a wonderful philosophy'. Consequence:
they are soon fleeing to Los Angeles with a suitcaseful of stolen cocaine.
I have left out four murders and sundry plot twists. But you get the point.
The movie, directed by Tony (Last Boy Scout) Scott and written by Quentin
(Reservoir Dogs) Tarantino, is the dramatic equivalent of having
half-a-dozen buckets of popcorn spilled over you. Everything you can think
of happens: love, death, violence, substance-abuse, dreams of escape, ghosts
of Elvis Presley. More to the point, they all keep happening simultaneously.
Fantasy crashes into reality. Sex gets enmeshed in plot development. (Marvel
at the gymnastic love bout that takes place in a roadside phone booth while
we are still trying to untangle the significance of the recent phone call).
And comedy is mixed with brutality. This last cocktail comes in the film's
most brilliantly unnerving scene. Mafia smoothie Christopher Walken is
elegantly, surgically insulted by interrogation victim Dennis Hopper
(Slater's father) before Walken finally walks into the camera lens (Hopper's
P-o-V) to blow his head off.
As a writer/director duo Scott and Tarantino are pulp cinema's answer to
Losey and Pinter. Tarantino provides the gnomic dialogue, Scott the ornate
visuals. Gasp at the gilded, smoke-textured interiors and the light-sculpted
close-ups; or at the gorgeously overblown 'balcony scene' on a
poster-dominated fire-escape outside Slater's flat, where the couple sit
swirled about by street steam and by their own reveries of escape.
Do not be deterred by the violence. There was worse in Webster and Ford, and
Tarantino is nothing if not a New Jacobean. Do not be deterred either by the
fact that True Romance was a box-office flop in the US. Originality is not
always a crowdpleaser; nor is a movie style that gobbles up different moods
like a child let loose on a chocolate box.
Much of Rising Sun is shot at night in the pouring rain. This must be an
irony: a comment on modern America's view of modern Japan as not so much a
sunrise neighbour, more a nation determined to rain on the US's parade. As
we know, Tokyo has already annexed much of Tinseltown. In this screen
version of the yellow-peril bestseller by Michael (Jurassic Park) Crichton,
Japan is about to close its jaws around a giant US computer company - with
what consequences for national security] - when Sean Connery and Wesley
Snipes arrive on the scene. Sean is an Armani-dressed East-West liaison
veteran. Wesley is a short-fused black cop learning Japanese on his car
cassette-player.
They arrive to solve a murder: the late-night strangling of a call-girl on
the Nakamoto boardroom table. They stay to unravel one of Those Plots, in
which conspiracy spreads all the way from LA to Washington.
Director Philip Kaufman has spent his career trying on different genre hats
from sci-fi (The Invasion Of The Body Snatchers) to high-tone erotica (Henry
And June). But the thriller hat fails to suit him. It slides off the back of
his head, revealing a cranium empty of ideas on how to make stage-Japanese
supporting characters live; how to stop his three screenwriters attaching
messages to their dialogue ('We're giving the country away'); or how to fool
us into believing that Connery and Snipes are more than another tired
variant on the rookie/oldtimer partnership of a million cop films.
But we still prefer it to The Secret Garden. Here the body of a famous
children's classic is found dead on a boardroom table: that of Warner
Brothers. Means: genteel strangulation. The culprit is director and former
Wajda scenarist Agnieszka Holland (of Man Of Iron). Determined to avoid
Frances Hodgson Burnett's Victorian sentimentality, she manages to avoid
every other tolerable emotion too. There is glum photography, a glum heroine
(Kate Maberly) and a glum garden, in which rabbits ruminate and ruins
glower. Stars, though, will happily be stars. As the snooty Yorkshire
housekeeper Maggie Smith is Maggie Smith, for which relief some thanks.
Robert De Niro in This Boy's Life is Robert De Niro. We enjoy - for a while
 -the Seattle accent and the overdressed-masher routine, as he courts single
mother Ellen Barkin prior to making life hell for her and her son Tobias.
Scene: a remote company town in Washington State. Time: 1950s.
The real Tobias (Wolff) wrote the memoir about life with bullying Stepdad
from which British director Michael Caton-Jones of Memphis Belle draws this
film. Well, not draws: rather pulls it protestingly forth like a thread from
an overlarge sweater. The plot seems too slight, the characters at once
overwrought and under-occupied: familiar signs that the original book was
richer in emotional texture than movie-friendly drama and has caused
collapsed inspiration at the studio story conference.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Arts: Berlioz resuscitated - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Studying in Paris, Berlioz abandoned medicine for music when he was 19. A
year later he composed a Messe solennelle, a full-dress Mass with orchestra,
which got just two performances. He became dissatisfied with it, and said
that he had burned the score - though he cannibalised some of the music for
use in later pieces. Until last year, that was all anyone knew about it; but
now we know otherwise. In Westminster Cathedral on Tuesday (and on BBC-2),
the Messe was heard again in a revelatory performance.
Last year Frans Moors, a Belgian part-time organist, discovered a full score
 -in Berlioz's own hand - tucked away in a chest, in the organ-gallery of
his Antwerp church: utterly unexpected. It seems that the young composer had
made a present of this manuscript to a fellow music-student, a violinist
from Antwerp. The musical world was alerted at once, and the honour of
performing the Messe anew went to John Eliot Gardiner with his period-band
l'Orchestre Revolutionnaire et Romantique and his Monteverdi Choir, who
brought it to London after touring Bremen, Vienna, Rome and Madrid.
Sometimes 'long-lost' scores do turn up: early Handel and Verdi, for
example, and bits of youthful Wagner, Debussy and Ravel. This Berlioz
rediscovery far outweighed any of those finds, for it is not just a juvenile
fragment, or an uncut version of something we knew only in a truncated form.
On the contrary: it is music strong enough in its own right that we would be
excited by it now even if Berlioz had died without writing another note -
and it is a treasure-trove of musical ideas that he recycled and extended in
the now-familiar works of his maturity.
In our century, the only comparable discovery that comes to mind is fairly
remote: the resuscitation of Beethoven's original Leonore opera (never
actually 'lost') for modern audiences who knew only the Fidelio that it
eventually became. But the raising of Leonore to a higher power was just a
specially rich example of Beethoven's thirst for expressive pithiness and
concision, like the development of the late quartet-music that can be read
in his sketchbooks; the Berlioz case is different.
The young Frenchman had always yearned to create grand, astounding works.
His precocious Messe was planned on a towering scale, astonishingly original
 -and remarkably successful, if uneven. Nothing much like Beethovenian
'symphonic argument' figures in it (nor is there much in later Berlioz);
rather, each of the 14 sections of his Messe would be vitalised by some
terrific, unheard-of musical idea, or several of them. And so they were;
with a little hindsight, it is easy to hear why the first Paris audiences
should have been astounded.
The best ideas would be retrieved in his Benvenuto Cellini opera (passim),
in the Symphonie fantastique (the plaintive strings of the 'Scene aux
champs' come straight from the Gratias here), in the great Te Deum and the
apocalyptic Requiem. Even the huge 'Dies irae' fanfares of the latter
stemmed from the Messe solennelle - without the supernumerary brass, but so
vivid here with the brazen quacks and snarls of Gardiner's 'period'
ophicleide, buccin and serpent as to make an equally hair-raising effect.
Everything in this performance was fresh-eared in the best Berliozian
spirit, superbly prepared, searchingly musical. Perhaps the vague cathedral
acoustic was unfair to the cultivated solo bass Gilles Cachemaille, who
sounded soft-grained in his fiercer declamations; but the high-register
soloists Donna Brown and Jean-Luc Viala made their confident marks, and the
Monteverdi Choir were marvellous in every detail.
Those of us who heard it all on the spot prided ourselves about what mere
BBC-2 couch-potatoes were missing: the bomb-scare in Victoria Street, the
consequent detours, confusions and delays, the drenching rain. On any other
occasion, Gardiner's account of Verdi's four Pezzi Sacri in the first half -
piercing, uncannily well-tuned, and dramatised phrase-by-phrase to a rare
Expressionist standard - would have earned several paragraphs of
awe-stricken praise.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Arts: Batsheva's 'Mabul' - Dance Umbrella
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To open this year's celebration of the newest choreographic ideas, Dance
Umbrella offered us the Batsheva Company from Israel. The Umbrella has
sheltered some pretty odd enterprises in the past, but Batsheva is, even in
these circumstances, like the ace of trumps.
The troupe is directed by Ohad Naharin, who is choreographer of the 75
minutes of Mabul (no indication as to meaning) which was on view on Tuesday
night at the Queen Elizabeth Hall. The ingredients are the seven men, seven
women of the company in less than flattering outfits of slate grey vests and
shorts; some singing (Naharin as a none too convincing counter-tenor; the
rest of the cast mellifluous); chatter, and fish-wife yapping from the
girls; a scream of horror - at least one of the dancers is also a critic; a
collection of Euro-dance incidents of little interest; musical snippets
ranging from Vivaldi, whom Naharin treats in cavalier fashion, to
pop-racket; a bleak stage; a hamster. (This last creeps over the head and
torso of a man while he gently writhes - as if dancing were not difficult
enough on its own).
The effect, as you may gather, is prodigiously tiresome. The Batsheva troupe
has gone through various mutations since it came into being 30 years ago as
a Martha Graham offspring. In its latest incarnation, Naharin's Mabul gives
it a neurotic, aggressive manner. Activity is, at best, inexplicable; at
worst, and there is a good deal of this, it aims for brutish effect. The
grumpier cliches of today's European dance are put through their paces yet
again. Bodies slam to the floor; routines of post-modern aridity show the
cast as a dull ensemble; movement is dead-pan, dead-end. Amid the gloomy,
shadowed lighting - a William Forsythe speciality for the Frankfurt Ballet -
the action has the ill-suppressed ferocity and all-too-evident frustrations
that I associate with long waits at Moscow Airport during the bad old days.
Were one, at the end of 75 minutes, to feel that some image, some
personality, had made a positive (let alone pleasing) effect, then the piece
might be justified. I found it leaden with its own self-importance,
inexpressive. Nor does it flatter its performers, whose style appears
without finesse or brilliance, though there is a virtuoso outburst of
body-slapping. In a programme note, Naharin says he feels blessed because he
was not born 'as a Bedouin woman who has had her clitoris removed'. I do not
think this is any excuse for making Mabul.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): On the road
costsdriven higher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Keeping a UK sales representative on the road costs an average of Pounds 731
a week, excluding management and office overheads, according to survey*
figures published today by the Reward pay research group and the Chartered
Institute of Marketing.
The figure is an increase of 4.3 per cent on a year ago - in line with the
average pay rise of 4 per cent for all sales and marketing staff over the
past 12 months, says the report.
Increases of 2-5 per cent for all staff are being forecast for the coming
year by participants in the survey.
A typical sales rep receives a salary of Pounds 14,878 a year, plus a bonus
payment of Pounds 2,000 or commission payment of Pounds 4,500.
It costs Pounds 9,612 to keep the rep's car on the road, a further Pounds
2,212 for meals and accommodation and Pounds 941 for a home telephone and
other miscellaneous costs.
Car telephones are expensive to run, according to the survey: 28 per cent of
reps now have them, but they add nearly Pounds 2,000 a year to running
costs.
The median total remuneration for a marketing manager, meanwhile, is Pounds
35,350; the figure for a senior product manager is Pounds 29,000, according
to data drawn from CIM's 24,000 members.
Over the last four years Vauxhall is reported as having overtaken Ford in
selling company cars to sales and marketing managers.
The most popular engine size in company cars remains 1800cc-2000cc.
*Sales and marketing rewards 1993-94. Price to CIM members Pounds 180,
others Pounds 220.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Fighting fire with
fire - US tobacco groups are under attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Faced with vocal anti-smoking lobbies and a revenue-hungry administration,
the US tobacco industry has long had reason to hone its marketing skills.
Arguably they are needed now as never before.
The latest threat to the sector is the proposal for a federal tax of up to
Dollars 1 (65p) a pack, a central part of the Clinton health plan.
On top of this, one of the sector's most compelling advertising figures - R.
J. Reynolds' Joe Camel - stands accused by the Coalition on Smoking or
Health of enticing young people to smoke. The Federal Trade Commission is
reviewing a request to ban him.
All this comes on top of 'Marlboro Friday', the day in April when Philip
Morris took the battle to its competitors by cutting the price of its
Marlboro brand by 40 cents.
The biggest change for manufacturers has been the switch to 'generic'
cigarettes, which hold no brand value and sell cheaply. To the dismay of the
cigarette companies, generic cigarettes now hold about 38 per cent of the
market.
With margins and brand share under attack cigarette manufacturers are
relying increasingly on techniques such as direct mail to reach their
potential clients. The leading US cigarette companies have compiled large
databases on smokers, and target potential customers by sending free packs
through the post. Another development has been the increased use of
cigarette catalogue 'clubs'.
Every pack of Marlboro purchased, for instance, contains a redeemable 'green
stamp'. By accumulating sufficient stamps, customers can purchase anything
from binoculars to lighters.
'First, smokers are induced to smoke more of that particular brand. Second,
once they have the products, such as a tee shirt with Marlboro written on
it, they become walking advertisements for the company,' says Edward Mally,
a tobacco analyst at Salomon Brothers in New York.
Another effective promotional technique has been R. J. Reynolds'
introduction of a 'flavour seal' in its Winston packs. Made of polyester
film, the seals have boosted market share of the brand by capitalising on
the cigarettes' freshness.
Advertising - which has seen its share of total advertising/promotion
expenditure fall from about a third five years ago to 20 per cent today  -
has not completely lost its effectiveness. The Marlboro man is one of the
most widely recognised advertising symbols. Two years ago researchers at the
Medical College of Georgia found that children between the ages of three and
five were as familiar with Joe Camel, the cartoon figure representing Camel
cigarettes, as they were with Mickey Mouse.
Cigarette companies still evade bans on television and radio advertising, by
sponsoring sports events and purchasing billboard space at televised events.
The anti-smoking forces, though, are now are producing sophisticated
television commercials themselves.
Growing numbers of advertising vehicles are refusing to promote cigarettes.
Houston and New York, for instance, have banned them from public transport.
The anti-smoking lobby is also gaining success in curbing cigarette
marketing aimed at women and minorities.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Pirates who walk the
plank - Philip Rawstorne reports on the relentless pursuit by companies of
brand counterfeiters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nothing demonstrates the value of brands more clearly than the frequency
with which they are copied and counterfeited around the world by
fly-by-night operators in search of a quick profit.
International Distillers and Vintners (IDV), the drinks subsidiary of Grand
Metropolitan, has taken action against about 50 brand pirates in its
international markets during the past year. There are eight lawsuits under
way involving infringements of its Smirnoff vodka brand alone.
Guinness's United Distillers, in relentless pursuit of counterfeiters of its
Johnnie Walker Scotch whisky, has also stamped on the creators of such
copy-cat brands as Johnnie Hawker, Joe Worker and Johnny Black.
Hiram Walker, the Allied-Lyons drinks company, has quashed attempts to cash
in on the reputation of its Ballantine's Scotch whisky in export markets by
brands called Ballentye's and Ballantia. Two court cases are pending
involving its brands in the UK. 'A brand is costly to create and establish,
but can be very easy and profitable to copy,' says Michael Leathes, legal
director of IDV.
'Brands are our most important assets. Through them we communicate the
quality of our products to consumers. They represent a huge investment of
time, effort and money, that can be diluted, weakened, even destroyed by
those who copy them.
'Counterfeits or imitations can be sold cheaper. Their producers do not have
to spend on advertising and marketing. Nor do they have to bother about the
quality of the drink or the packaging. We have to be rigorous in the
protection of our brands against the damage that copies can do to them.'
Brand counterfeiting - the creation of facsimiles - is a criminal offence in
most countries in which the drinks groups operate, and once the
counterfeiters are identified is relatively easy to stop.
At the other extreme, agreed settlements can usually be quickly reached on
unintentional infringements. Inver House, an independent Scotch whisky
distiller, recently changed the name of its Knockdhu malt whisky brand to
Cnoc to avoid an identity clash with IDV's Knockando.
The main problems arise from imitations which deliberately seek to deceive
consumers by suggesting an affinity with a leading brand: using a similar
name, or similar designs and colours in their bottles and labels.
Smirnoff's imitators, with names such as Smirnovskaya, Romanoff and
Selikoff, have appeared in look-alike bottles, with labels featuring the
crown, shields and other designs associated with the original.
The success of another IDV brand, Bailey's Irish Cream liqueur, has
encouraged the illegal production of a host of copies, including Bailes,
Teleys and Raylas, all in squat brown bottles with pastoral scenes
incorporated into the labels.
Rip-off artists have translated Ouzo 12 into Ouzo 21, J &amp; B Scotch into M &amp;
B, and Malibu coconut liqueur into Marabou. United Distillers discovered
that its Gordon's gin suddenly had a new competitor labelled Garden's gin,
and that in some markets its White Horse whisky brand was facing creations
called Black Horse and White Housie.
Tia Maria, Hiram Walker's coffee liqueur, has been a popular target for
imitations. The fakes, disguised by almost identical packaging, have
included Zia Marina, Tia Lia and Bella Maria.
As a Canadian court recently affirmed, the 'trade dress' of a product is
entitled to legal protection. Competitors cannot trade on the distinctive
identity of a rival brand.
All the leading drinks companies have specialist departments to counter such
exploitation. Leathes sums up the general policy for dealing with offenders.
'We stamp on them as hard as we can. Our aim is to hurt those responsible as
much as possible. Tough action deters others.'
Trademark infringements are civil offences. 'We sue first and talk later,'
he says. 'We demand damages to cover loss of profit and reputation.'
In Spain last year, a court awarded multi-million dollar damages against the
producer of a Bailey's look-alike product. Earlier this year, a Netherlands
company was ordered by a St Petersburg court to destroy 100,000 bottles of
its Smirnovskaya vodka and pay substantial costs and damages.
An Italian producer of 'Gilbert's gin' was forced to change the name and the
design of its labels which bore a resemblance to those of Gilbey's gin.
Apart from paying costs, it has to obtain IDV's approval for its future
labels.
It sometimes proves difficult to gather enough evidence to take offenders to
court. Rogue drinks producers rarely keep records and often move their
activities from one shell company to another.
Solving such problems requires a more unconventional approach. Corporate
investigation agencies, such as London-based Carratu International, are
called in to uncover the people behind the scam.
'Their inquiries often enable us to bring pressure to bear on the offenders
in other ways,' says Leathes. 'They may uncover other offences that interest
the police or tax authorities, find evidence that enables us to sue
personally the directors of a rogue company, perhaps to sequestrate their
homes or other property.'
Steve Smith, Carratu's managing director, says that protection of brands now
accounts for a large part of the agency's work. 'Drinks brands are a popular
target now in the Commonwealth of Independent States and other eastern
European countries,' he says. 'Imitation products, usually two or three
container loads at a time, are being shipped there from the Netherlands and
Germany in particular.'
But fake products continue to appear in many markets from southern Europe to
the Pacific Rim and Latin America. Inadequate legal frameworks in several
countries add to the difficulties of enforcing the protection of trademarks.
Leathes would like to see the European Community reinforce brand owners'
security as the US has done - by making trademark protection an essential
part of its trade agreements with other countries.

FT  14 OCT 93 / People: Human planning seeks boardroom recognition
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The world of human resource management - still known as personnel in some
quarters - is often a vital element in corporate life. Slotting round pegs
into round holes is never as easy as it sounds; yet the personnel department
and its leadership is not the centre of gravity for many companies.
But that is changing, according to Chris Brewster, director of the Cranfield
school of management's centre for European human resource management, who
has just been created professor in the same faculty.
'What is happening is that human resource management has always been
important for companies, but now it is becoming much more visible. As
companies have to become more cost effective, they have to learn how to
manage their human resources much more cleverly than in the past,' says
Brewster.
Brewster's research shows half of all companies in Europe now have a human
resource director on the board; he believes that percentage will increase in
the next few years.
It is certainly an area of corporate life where there currently seems to be
a flurry of activity in the UK.
Don Young, formerly director of organisation and personnel at Thorn EMI, has
joined REDLAND as its director of human resources; David Garth, previously
with Sears, has moved to the newly-created post of head of human resources
at TARMAC, reporting to group chief operating officer John Lovering; Raymond
Bainbridge is taking over as head of personnel of HONEYWELL'S European
control components division; Andrew Mayo has moved at ICL from being its
European personnel director to the company's director of human resource
development; and Marc Dufour is moving from the US to become group personnel
director for NORTH WEST WATER.
British Telecom's group personnel director, Richard Worsley, is taking a
three year secondment from BT to become director of the Carnegie Third Age
programme, which, among other things, seeks to promote employment and
educational opportunities for people aged 50 and over.

Television viewers in Orlando, Florida, will be invited to turn on, tune in
and print out next year, when Time Warner launches its US interactive cable
television services network.
As an adjunct to television shopping, 'movies on demand', video games,
information services and a host of other programming planned for interactive
television, Time Warner will provide 4,000 subscribers involved in its
Orlando I-TV trial with specially modified Hewlett-Packard colour printers.
Linked to the TV cable, the printers will enable users to make paper copies
of TV screen images - Madonna in a striking pose or a family snapshot from a
home video. The core technology for this new service was derived from HP's
new line of 'Vidjet Pro' printers for video production professionals.
Connected to any video source, such as a television or laser-disc player,
these printers store and reproduce individual frames, or sequences of
frames, on plain paper at a fraction of the cost of current methods. The
'home media printing service' will also let cable subscribers print out news
and information selected from menus on the TV screen.
The printer will enhance I-TV services such as 'TV shopping'. Using a remote
control device, the subscriber could select the 'Shopping Mall' section of
Time Warner's I-TV network. A menu would enable the viewer to select a car
based on a choice of priorities such as model, price, features or
manufacturer. Next choice: 'info-mercials' about cars that might suit. Still
interested? Press a button on the remote control and a colour brochure
giving details of the car is printed out. A few more clicks and the
subscriber can request a test drive. A local dealer will receive the message
 -via his printer.
Printers might also help to solve a thorny problem facing developers of I-TV
services. Consumer research suggests that when given the ability to choose
from a broad range of programming, the majority of viewers will not watch TV
advertising.
Of more than 3,000 people interviewed by H&amp;M Consulting, a California market
research firm, 73 per cent said they do not want advertising to impinge upon
their interactive viewing. However, without advertising revenues, the cost
of I-TV would be well above the average Dollars 12 a month consumers expect
to pay for interactive services, says Mark Macgillivray of H&amp;M.
By printing out discount coupons or offering further information in the form
of brochures, order forms or price quotations, the 'home media printing
service' can provide an incentive for viewers to watch advertising. And
because viewers will select which commercials to watch, advertising can be
tightly targeted to prospective customers.
The Orlando trial will provide valuable consumer feedback on all aspects of
interactive television. HP acknowledges that its agreement to link printers
to the cable TV service is experimental. One question is whether people will
accept a printer in their living rooms. 'The printer will have to be very
small, and cost no more than Dollars 300-Dollars 400 (Pounds 197-Pounds
263),' says Jim Olson, general manager of HP's new video communications
division.
For HP, the leading manufacturer of non-impact printers, the I-TV trial also
represents an opportunity to explore the potential of 'home peripherals' -
products that blend home entertainment and computer technologies.
Another question will be whether home computer owners need an extra printer
tied to their TV sets. It might be more efficient to link the TV cable to an
existing PC printer. The next step in the confluence of computer and
consumer electronics technology may be the 'home network' - linking the PC
in the study to the TV in the living room.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Technology: Planning for a speedy recovery - Joia
Shillingford on how NatWest got its computers back on their feet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOIA SHILLINGFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The night before the Bishopsgate bomb in the City of London, Mary Jackson,
head of technology at the NatWest Tower, came back from holiday. Next day,
Saturday April 24, her mobile telephone rang.
The building was in darkness, she was told, and 10 of her staff were inside.
'We thought it was just a routine bomb scare and were irritated by the
thought of our weekend maintenance work being delayed by two hours,' says
systems manager Geoff Taylor.
He looked into the computer room. The computers were exposed to the elements
and some equipment, including a Wang minicomputer and a mid-range IBM
AS/400, had been damaged. But most were still running. Since then, Jackson
and her colleagues have been involved in both technology change and disaster
recovery.
She first contacted 20 of her staff and asked them to meet her on Sunday.
From the building, they removed important files such as a printout with
details of all computer equipment allocated to each person in the tower.
Most equipment had survived. But dust and glass had rained on to the
computers, getting between cracks and under keyboards. Loss adjustors said
they would have to be removed, taken apart, cleaned and re-assembled.
Personal computers and substitute Wang systems had to be borrowed from other
parts of NatWest and suppliers. Voice and data lines were installed and
re-routed through the bank's alternative City communications centre.
By Monday, all critical staff were provided with a telephone and PC. At
first, most only had access to standalone PCs. But Friday night's Wang
back-up tapes (moved off-site early on Saturday morning as usual) were
installed.
Since then, Jackson's department has worked overtime to organise removal of
computers, tapes, telephones and photocopiers from the tower to spare
NatWest offices nearby in Drapers Gardens.
Each batch of machines has been transferred to another floor and labelled
for despatch to the site where its former users now work. A final assessment
of computer damage has yet to be made. Some of the Wang equipment was
damaged, but the bank was already moving to PC-based local area networks
(Lans) running the Windows graphical user interface and a mixture of
Microsoft and Lotus applications. The bomb accelerated this process.
The tower's computer environment has now been duplicated at Drapers Gardens.
But Jackson's team cannot relax. Taylor and other IT staff will work until
Christmas to supervise the introduction of new Lans at Drapers Gardens as
more users move in.
The introduction of PC-based technology has involved a steep learning curve
for Jackson's staff and users. 'Because of the bomb we've been forced to
make a momentous leap from old systems to new.' Users who worked on Wang
systems in the tower, and with PCs or standalone Wang terminals at their
temporary accommodation, have transferred to Microsoft Windows applications
at Drapers Gardens.
No one receives any other training until they have been trained on the
Windows interface. 'We make it very hard for them to say no to training
because we offer it when it's convenient for them: day, night or even
Sunday,' says Jackson.
Despite the rushed timetable, users' acceptance of change has been
remarkable, says Jackson. 'They know they have no choice but to adapt
because the old system has gone. If we'd wanted to duplicate what they had
before, we would have had to cable Drapers Gardens for Wang, then re-cable
for LANs.'
Meanwhile, a new computer disaster recovery plan is being developed, perhaps
using different NatWest data centres as back-up. 'We had a disaster recovery
plan before but recent experiences have focused our minds on becoming the
best in the business,' says Jackson. 'We now have a hand-picked disaster
recovery team made up of people with specialised knowledge who also do other
jobs. And we have a detailed but highly confidential, plan which we are
about to test.'

FT  14 OCT 93 / People: Paul takes over as Norwich Union chairman
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
George Paul, 53, chief executive of Harrison &amp; Crosfield, the agriculture
and foods conglomerate, is to take over as chairman of Norwich Union, the
insurance and investment group. He replaces Michael Falcon, now 65, who is
retiring at the group's annual general meeting next April, after 30 years as
a director of the group.
Mr Paul, who has been a director of Norwich Union since April 1990 and
vice-chairman since May 1992, has taken a keen interest in risk and
insurance management, arguing that both insurance buyers and insurers
themselves can much to reduce losses - and insurance claims - by
implementing effective risk management schemes.
At Harrison &amp; Crosfield claims from fires, thefts and accidents have fallen
sharply and insurance costs reduced by between 30 and 50 per cent, since the
group appointed a full-time risk manager and introduced safety features such
as sprinkler systems to its factories, warehouses and offices. Mr Paul also
plays an active role in crime prevention work in his native Suffolk and is
an advocate of greater insurance industry involvement in the area.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Badgerline group, comprising bus and coach operations in the south of
England, Wales and west Midlands, has appointed Andy Higginson, right, as a
non-executive board member. Higginson has been finance director of Laura
Ashley Holdings since 1990 and was previously finance director of Guinness
Brewing International.
Badgerline is busying itself preparing for its float on the London Stock
Exchange, planned for November.
Its executive chairman, Trevor Smallwood, says that Higginson's experience
of public companies was a key factor in making his appointment. Smallwood,
who says that he has 'been in buses for 27 years', felt that the five
executives already had sufficient knowledge of the transport business.
Higginson joins two other non-executives on the board: Bill Forman, who
joined on his retirement from Vickers in 1991, and Philip Williams, who is
with Hill Samuel in Birmingham.
Badgerline started life in September 1986, being one of numerous splinters
from the old state-run National Bus company, privatised as a result of the
1985 Transport Act.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Technology: Pick of the Russian software crop - Andrew
Fisher on the wealth of engineering talent in Moscow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Doing business in Russia might not seem the most attractive of propositions
just now, let alone employing experts there to develop a core part of your
business.
But one US computer company, Pick Systems, has found that the skills of
software writers in the former Soviet Union have enabled it to expand its
product range more quickly and cheaply than if it had relied solely on the
facilities at its Irvine, California, headquarters.
'We couldn't afford to put the same amount of resources in the US for cost
reasons,' says Denis Hill, a Pick director. The company, which developed
computer systems in the 1960s for the US Army in Vietnam, employs nearly 60
software engineers (two-thirds of its total) in Moscow, and plans to double
this by spring.
Unlike some other international computer concerns, Pick is not simply using
Russian software experts to develop applications for local use. Pick
software is widely used in Russia, operating at some 200 sites in Moscow and
St Petersburg, one of its chief functions being to keep an eye on tax
payments.
The company wanted to do more than this, however. Having begun to employ
Russian experts four years ago when they first became available after the
Soviet empire collapsed, it then decided to put them to work on developing
its basic operating software - designed before the emergence of open systems
such as Unix - and adding new functions. These are now about to come onto
the market.
'We are seeing the first fruits of our labour,' says Glyn Yarnall, UK sales
director, about Pick's Moscow development centre. It will soon move from its
cramped offices in the Olympic stadium.
Pick's Russian employees, whose average age is about 30 - 'these are fast
track, really bright young guys,' says Hill - have developed both a
graphical user interface (to simplify on-screen instruction) and a
structured query language (enabling easier access to databases) to
strengthen the company's software range. 'Without Moscow, this would have
cost more and taken longer,' adds Yarnall.
Because of their academic background and the fact that, in the communist
days, they had to do without western computer equipment and thus work out
their own systems and solutions, Pick's Russian employees tend to have a
stronger scientific leaning than those in Irvine, reckons Hill. 'These
people have a really solid education in software engineering.'
Although costs are rising rapidly in Russia, they are still significantly
lower than in the US, apart from office rents. Hill says the cost of the
Moscow operation is around Dollars 25,000 (Pounds 16,500) a month; in the
US, the figure would be around Dollars 500,000. With the benefit of modern
communications techniques, it is easy for Irvine and Moscow to keep in touch
electronically.
Obviously, the company will not always be able to choose from among the best
of Russian engineers, whose skills have also been used by companies such as
Apple Computer.
Pick's first crop of recruits included software engineers who had worked on
Soviet aeronautical, military and satellite programmes, as well as in
computer research. 'It is a blunt fact that if we didn't take them on,
someone else would have,' says Yarnall. 'But you can't always get that
calibre, so you also have to go for the second division people.'
Despite the temptations of life abroad, Pick's Russian employees are
generally content to stay where they are.
'They're not always keen to move,' notes Hill. 'They weren't used to
mobility under communism. But they have enormous opportunities in Moscow,
while in the US it is tougher to compete.'
Having just returned to Irvine from Moscow, Hill says the Pick employees
there - for the past six months, including no one from the US - worked right
through the latest crisis. 'They're living the adventure of what's going on
in their country.'

FT  14 OCT 93 / National Grid plans discounts scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSEHOLDS could reduce their electricity bills by opting to install special
meters that cut off some domestic appliances during periods of peak demand,
according to proposals put forward by the National Grid yesterday.
The National Grid, which runs the electricity transmission system in England
and Wales, also asked large industrial users to consider signing up to be
cut off at short notice in return for savings on their annual bills of about
10 per cent.
The proposals mark the latest move to increase the flexibility of the
electricity supply system where power generation is in the hands of the
National Power and PowerGen duopoly.
National Grid pays Pounds 310m a year to the two generators for a series of
back-up services required to run a safe, and economic electricity supply.
These costs are, in turn, passed on to consumers.
If large users, and eventually, domestic customers, agree to be cut off
during peak periods, the National Grid will not require certain back-up
services such as plant held in reserve (by the generators) to meet surges in
demand.
'By securing an alternative supply for these vital services, we are
expanding competition into this area,' Mr Charles Davis, National Grid's
commercial manager, said
at a seminar for 100 representatives of the UK's largest electricity-using
businesses.
National Power welcomed the proposals, but said the room for cost savings
was limited.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Oil drilling to start in Poole Bay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN OIL drilling rig is expected to be towed into Poole Bay, Dorset, this
week to start six to eight weeks of exploration in the environmentally
sensitive area.
The rig, which will be about 8km off the coast, will drill into a rock
structure about 2,000 metres beneath the sea bed. Elf Enterprise, a joint
venture between Elf Aquitaine, the state-controlled French group, and
Enterprise Oil, the UK independent exploration and production company,
stressed that 'safety of people and the environment will be our first
priority'.
Previous explorations in Poole Bay triggered protests by environmentalists
and the local fishing industry, which last year organised demonstrations
against a large-scale seismic survey of the area.
Elf Enterprise said it had made elaborate arrangements to protect marine
life. A pollution control vessel will be stationed near the rig throughout
the drilling programme and Southampton University will study the state of
marine life before and after the drilling.
New techniques, such as horizontal drilling under the bay from an onshore
site, have been used to meet environmental objections. The site being
drilled by Elf Enterprise, however, is just beyond the reach of such
techniques, the company said. But it might be used for production if
recoverable quantities of oil were found.
Support for a Pounds 300m link between the UK gas distribution system and
that of the Continent is strong enough to justify additional studies,
according to a survey released yesterday.
An industry study group of British-based and Norwegian producers said it
hoped to have worked out details by the middle of next year.
The proposed interconnector would run from Bacton in Suffolk to Zeebrugge in
Belgium.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Molyneaux snubs Dublin meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JAMES Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, has ruled out an
imminent meeting with Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, to discuss the
Hume-Adams peace initiative, in spite of strong interest in Dublin for such
a meeting.
Mr Molyneaux yesterday said: 'I already know what's in (the initiative). It
is a grandiose scheme calling for the self-determination of the whole of
Ireland and designed to go over the heads . . . of the people of Northern
Ireland.'
The UUP is not demanding to be briefed on the initiative and Mr Molyneaux
has no plans for an imminent meeting with Mr Spring. This contradicted
reports in the Irish media that Mr Molyneaux was already in Dublin. 'I am
flattered to discover that I am the first mortal to appear in two places at
once,' he said. 'I have been working a long time to achieve that.'
The reports appear to be fuelled by the Irish government's keen interest to
talk to the unionist parties.
The Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin said: 'We would very much look
forward to a meeting with the unionist leadership if it could be arranged.'
Mr Molyneaux did not specifically rule out the possibility of a meeting at a
later stage.
The Irish government was briefed last week on the Hume-Adams peace
initiative by Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour
party. Details are being kept secret for fear that what is now considered a
nascent peace process could be halted by publicity before all parties have
been given a chance to consider the proposals.
Unionist interest in the initiative was indicated earlier this week by the
Rev Martin Smyth, Ulster Unionist MP for South Belfast, who said that Sinn
Fein would be accepted by the UUP at the negotiating table if there was to
be a total cessation of violence. What remains to be clarified are the terms
on which the IRA would abandon its 25-year military campaign.
Mr Ken Maginnis, UUP deputy leader, said yesterday that an end to violence
would require the handing-over of all arms caches by the IRA and other
paramilitary groups.

FT  14 OCT 93 / One in four reject M-way tolls plan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A QUARTER of motorists would stop using motorways if they were charged
Pounds 50 a year to use them, the Consumers' Association said yesterday.
Even Pounds 25 a year would lead to one in six deserting motorways, its
survey of 1,168 drivers interviewed early last month found. The government
is considering introducing motorway charging and has suggested cash raised
could be used to speed up road building. But 85 per cent of those surveyed
said motorists should not have to pay extra to fund any improvements, and
nine out of 10 motorists who said they were against funding any sort of
improvement thought they already paid enough.
'Traffic congestion is the scourge of the 1990s but forcing drivers off
motorways isn't going to help,' said Mr Derek Prentice, association
assistant director. 'If road pricing is introduced only those motorists in
the higher income brackets may be prepared to use motorways.'

FT  14 OCT 93 / Sizewell C go-ahead sought amid safety fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NUCLEAR ELECTRIC, the state-owned utility, is expected to provoke
controversy today by submitting a planning application to build the
country's biggest nuclear station at Sizewell in Suffolk.
It is to brush aside Whitehall concerns that submitting an application for
the Pounds 3.5bn twin reactor will complicate the controversy surrounding
the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant in Sellafield whose future is under
government review.
Separately, a report by the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate leaked to the
BBC yesterday raises questions about the safety software at Sizewell B,
Britain's first pressurised water reactor on which Sizewell C is modelled.
The report says that while the software is of high quality it cannot be
confident that Nuclear Electric's target failure rate, of one in every
10,000 times it is used, can be achieved.
Nuclear Electric said its non-computerised back-up to the software provided
standards as good as the primary systems at other nuclear power stations. It
believed it could meet its targets.
Sizewell C would be the biggest civil engineering project in the country,
providing more than 15,000 jobs during the 10 years of its construction and
commissioning, according to the company.
The submission for the reactor will anger environmentalists, who believe
that Nuclear Electric should hold back until the end of the government's
nuclear review. This is due to start later this year and will examine
whether further nuclear stations are necessary.
The proposed plant would have a capacity of 2,600MW more than twice the
capacity of Sizewell B, which is nearing completion on an adjacent site.
Confirming Nuclear Electric's submission plans, Mr Bob Hawley, chief
executive, said last night that the planning, building and commissioning
process would take some years. 'The earliest we can commission the station
is 2001,' he said.
'We do not want to pre-empt the nuclear review nor will we be able to do so.
But we believe strongly that a replacement is needed for the Magnox nuclear
stations.'
An application by Nuclear Electric's predecessor, the CEGB, to build
Sizewell B resulted in a three-year public inquiry in the 1980s. Nuclear
Electric hopes to avoid a similar delay on Sizewell C by arguing that the
safety implications have already examined in the B inquiry and another at
Hinkley Point, Somerset.
The economics of the project are likely to be examined in the nuclear
review. The company says any inquiry into Sizewell C should therefore be
restricted to general planning issues such as site access.
Environmentalists are certain to press for a more wide-ranging review.
Nuclear Electric generates about 23 per cent of England and Wales's annual
electricity requirements and Mr Hawley said it would not expect to go much
beyond 30 per cent. In the long run it hopes to operate six pressurised
water reactor plants.
The company is applying for planning consent to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade
and industry secretary, under section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Bids for Markham colliery invited
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL yesterday invited private mining companies to bid for the
licence to operate Markham colliery in Derbyshire.
Markham is the first and, so far, the only one of the 12 pits reprieved in
March to close.
The colliery produced 1.5m tonnes of coal in its last full year of
production before its closure in the summer.
The 400 miners at Markham, which once employed 2,400, voted to accept
voluntary redundancy.
Private-sector interest is likely to be limited. Of the first 19 mines to be
put out to tender following their closure this year, only 13 tenders remain
under active consideration by British Coal and three of them involve surface
assets only. Only three mining companies have made bids.
Separately, union leaders led by Mr John Monks, general secretary of the
Trades Union Congress, last night pressed Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, to
halt pit closures.
Mr Monks said: 'We need to achieve a coal-led energy policy through a
constructive dialogue, not a political stand-off.'
But Mr Eggar was unable to give any assurances over the future of Britain's
deep-mined coal industry and he refused to call a halt to pit closures as
the TUC wanted.
Mr Eggar said the outlook for coal was 'difficult' and he was unable to
prevent the development of more gas-fired power stations. Nor was he ready
to use any of the Pounds 500m subsidy allocated to help the coal industry.
'Mr Eggar is not even prepared to implement his own white paper,' said Mr
Roger Lyons, the TUC energy committee chairman. He added: 'The minister gave
the impression that he wants to wash his hands of the coal industry as soon
as possible.'
Mr Monks said: 'There is a major chasm between the government and the unions
over markets, pit safety and the privatisation of the coal industry.'
However, the minister did say that he would consider whether to extend the
existing favourable redundancy terms for miners which are due to end on
December 30.
More than 22,000 mineworkers have left the industry since last October,
leaving just 30,000 at 30 pits.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Kent chambers form alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMALL CHAMBERS of commerce in Kent are joining together to promote the
county's attractions as a business centre in competition with Continental
markets.
The formal establishment of the single European market and the opening of
the Channel tunnel next year highlight the need for more effective business
support in the county.
Mr Martin Graham, chief executive of the new Kent chamber, said: 'We are the
exposed flank of Britain.'
The creation of the Kent Chamber of Commerce and Industry is intended to
boost local industry's exports, improve the quality of business information
and strengthen training.
Kent's fragmented chamber network, just across the Channel from powerful,
publicly funded chambers in France and Belgium, has long been seen as an
example of the weakness of the British system.
Mr Graham commented: 'A Spanish businessman visited one of our chambers up a
dingy flight of stairs and said: 'Are you serious?''
Six of Kent's smaller chambers, including Maidstone and Dover, with a
combined membership of 1,500 businesses, have combined to form the new
chamber and talks are continuing to bring in a further five, including
Dartford, Ashford and Canterbury.
If agreement can be reached between all 11 chambers, the Kent chamber would
have a membership of 3,000 businesses and rank third among UK chambers after
Birmingham and Thames Valley, Mr Graham said. It would qualify as one of a
nationwide network of 50 'core chambers' which is being established by the
Association of British Chambers of Commerce.
Negotiations over the creation of the Kent chamber have taken three years.
It has obtained Pounds 300,000 of funding for its first year of operation
from Kent Training and Enterprise Council, Kent County Council and the
Department of Trade and Industry with declining amounts of finance for a
further four years.
Mr Graham said Kent had failed to create a single chamber in the past
because of the lack of a large natural commercial centre in the county.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Business travel spending 'set to rise'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS travel expenditure is expected to show a bigger rise in the UK this
year than in any other European country except Hungary, American Express
said yesterday.
Its survey of 3,500 companies in 10 European countries found that UK
business travel spending is expected to rise 9 per cent this year to Pounds
19.2bn. This follows declines of 2 per cent last year and 9 per cent in
1991.
Expenditure in Hungary is predicted to grow by 14.3 per cent from a low
base. Spanish spending will rise by 4.4 per cent. Travel spending is
expected to fall 6 per cent in Germany, 4 per cent in France, 11 per cent in
Sweden and 5 per cent in Switzerland, the survey says.
The largest increases in UK expenditure are expected to occur in the energy
and chemicals sector, manufacturing and retailing. Financial services and
construction are expected to show the smallest rises, while travel
expenditure will decline in the transport and communications sector.
The UK has the highest proportion of women business travellers in Europe,
accounting for 23 per cent of the total. The proportion has doubled since
1989. In financial services companies, 44 per cent of business travellers
are women. Spain had the second highest proportion of women travellers at 17
per cent, followed by Switzerland at 14 per cent and Sweden at 12 per cent.
Just 11 per cent of senior UK managers fly first class on long-haul flights,
with 48 per cent travelling business class, 26 per cent economy and 15 per
cent having no fixed policy. The proportion of first-class UK flyers is in
line with the European average, but is below Spain, where 21 per cent fly
first class, and Belgium on 19 per cent.

FT  14 OCT 93 / BR move clears way for leasing market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday moved to allay fears over the future of British
Rail's West Coast main line services after Network SouthEast won a year-long
battle for new trains to be financed under an innovative Pounds 150m leasing
deal.
The deal announced yesterday ends months of speculation over how BR would
use a special leasing concession announced in last year's Autumn Statement,
and will benefit up to 125,000 London commuters.
It opens the way to the creation of a leasing market for rolling stock and
also safeguards for a year the jobs of more than 1,000 workers at ABB
Transportation's York works, where the new trains will be built.
InterCity's West Coast main line had been vying with Network SouthEast for
new trains, but BR has decided to use the concession to lease 41 new
four-coach Networker Express trains for Great Northern and Kent Coast
services. Existing Great Northern trains will be switched to the London,
Tilbury &amp; Southend line.
The announcement was criticised by opposition parties. While welcoming the
investment in Network SouthEast, Mr Nick Harvey, Liberal Democrat transport
spokesman, said the future of the West Coast main line was now in question.
But Mr Roger Freeman, minister for public transport, said BR's decision did
not reflect any doubts over the importance of the line.
He said he was prepared to consider subsidising services on the line - even
after it is franchised, in 1995 or 1996, as part of rail privatisation. A
'shadow team' would be running the services in a year's time, which would
show how much money they are losing.
Mr Freeman also stressed that 'we must have a replacement' for the West
Coast line's rolling stock. He said the Department of Transport and the
Treasury wanted to discuss with GEC Alsthom, the engineering group, its
'interesting new ideas' on leasing. The Anglo-French group's bid to build 11
InterCity 225 trains was judged too expensive.
Yesterday's announcement is an important step in the rail privatisation
process because it paves the way towards the much-derided concept of an
'operating lease' market for rolling stock.
Under this the private sector - in this case ABB - is responsible for
financing, building and maintaining the trains, and also accepts the risks
involved in the 'residual value' of the equipment after the lease ends.
Mr Freeman said the deal had 'proved the sceptics wrong.' The creation of a
fully fledged operating lease market financed by the private sector would
allow the government to concentrate scarce public funds on rail
infrastructure.
Transport is among the areas expected to be discussed at today's meeting of
EDX, the cabinet's public expenditure committee, amid reports that the
Treasury plans to cut departmental capital spending budgets.
Ministers are considering scrapping plans to make contributions to large
transport projects such as the Pounds 2bn Crossrail scheme for London in
favour of proposals to provide subsidies once such schemes are up and
running.
The roads budget, which has grown strongly in the past two years, is also
under scrutiny.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Nine arrested in customs raid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NINE people were yesterday arrested in dawn raids by customs officers
following an investigation into insolvencies, including some linked to
London and Provincial Factors, the debt trading company which collapsed
owing almost Pounds 7m in March.
About 70 officers took part in Operation Garden which followed an
eight-month investigation. They seized several vanloads of papers and
computers from six business premises in west London.
Mr Michael Rowan, 44, of Hampton, Middlesex, was charged with evading
payments of value added tax - thought to be in the region of Pounds 2m  -
under section 39 (3) of the 1983 VAT Act. He was being held overnight and
will appear at City Magistrates Court today.
Customs and Excise investigations division released the other eight men on
police bail pending further investigation.
The collapse of London and Provincial Factors surprised other companies in
the industry. Debt trading companies - known as factors - provide services
ranging from taking over management of clients' sales ledgers to lending
them a percentage of the value of their invoices. Clients are usually liable
for bad debts and it is rare for a factor to go bust.
At least five companies, which were all clients of LPF, are known to have
gone into liquidation since July 1990, owing more than Pounds 3m to the
factoring company, according to liquidators' estimates.
LPF's collapse has prompted the Association of British Factors and
Discounters to urge the Bank of England to regulate independent factors more
tightly.
The association's members account for more than 90 per cent of the
industry's turnover. LPF, now in the hands of receivers, is not a member.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Inflation rises for third month to reach annual 1.8%:
Significant jump in prices since summer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INFLATION ROSE for the third consecutive month in September, undermining the
notion that inflationary pressures are dead.
Boosted by higher prices for second-hand cars and petrol, retail price
inflation rose 0.4 per cent on the month, taking the annual rate of increase
from 1.7 to 1.8 per cent.
Prices are now rising significantly faster than during the summer when
inflation hit bottom. The latest figures suggest retailers have made the
most of a pick-up in consumer demand by raising prices.
The latest rise poses a dilemma for Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor.
Measures announced in the last Budget - including value added tax on
domestic fuel and the restriction of tax relief on mortgage interest - will
add an extra percentage point to underlying inflation next year. An
extension of VAT in the November Budget would make it difficult to contain
inflation within its target range of 1 per cent to 4 per cent.
Stripping out mortgage interest payments, the index rose a seasonally
adjusted 3.3 per cent in the year to September, compared with 3.1 per cent
in August. This underlying measure of inflation has nudged closer to the 4
per cent upper limit of its Treasury target range in every month since May,
when it hit a trough of 2.8 per cent.
The Central Statistical Office figures show that price rises last month were
fairly evenly spread. Food prices fell between August and September but
there were further price rises for clothing and household goods.
Cigarette prices rose 0.6 per cent on the month, and were 9.3 per cent more
than a year ago. Tobacco prices are rising faster than any other component
of the RPI.
Housing costs continued to fall, reflecting reductions in mortgage interest
payments compared with a year ago. In the year to September housing prices
fell by 6.7 per cent.
Clothing and footwear prices rose 3.8 per cent on the month to stand 1.8 per
cent up on a year ago. The increase reflected the end of summer sales.
Motoring expenditure rose 0.3 per cent on the month and was 6.1 per cent up
on the year. A month-on-month rise of 1 per cent in leisure services prices
reflected higher charges for evening classes and other recreational
activities. The retail prices index in September was 141.9.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Optimism among Scots companies still growing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONFIDENCE among Scottish businesses about their prospects is still rising,
although at a slightly slower rate than before, according to the latest
chambers of commerce survey.
Optimism is increasing among manufacturing companies with a marked
improvement among construction companies. Confidence in the retail and
wholesale distribution trades and in tourism and leisure is also rising.
The survey, analysed by economic forecasters at the Fraser of Allander
Institute of Strathclyde University, shows demand rising in all sectors.
However, the domestic Scottish market appears less buoyant than the rest of
the UK and export markets.
The survey shows that investment by manufacturers in plant and machinery is
increasing while investment in buildings continues to fall.
Employment trends are the best since 1990. A number of sectors reported
recruitment difficulties.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Business braced for rate increases of 22%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY businesses in England and Wales could face rises in the uniform
business rate of more than 22 per cent next April as a result of yesterday's
retail price index figures.
The RPI increased by just 1.8 per cent, but those still adjusting to the
business rate from the old system may face additional transitional payments
of up to 20 per cent.
Mr Robin Goodchild, head of research at Gerald Eve, a London-based firm of
rating surveyors, warned yesterday that retailers and other businesses would
face rises of up to 22.15 per cent unless the November Budget deferred the
transitional increases.
Mr Goodchild said: 'This isn't going to help the recovery. Retailers are
certainly struggling.'
The arrangements, which were announced when the rate was introduced, limited
transitional rises to 20 per cent a year.
Coupled with the increase in the rate of inflation to 1.8 per cent, the
maximum business rate rise next year could be up to 22.15 per cent.
Any rises in the rate itself are limited by law to the increase shown by the
RPI figures in the previous year. The rate will be 42.3p in England and
44.8p in Wales from next April 1 unless ministers make any adjustments. That
compares with the rate in England of 41.6p this year and 40.2p last year,
and in Wales of 44p and 42.5p respectively.
About 500,000 of the 1.8m business premises in England and Wales are still
subject to transitional arrangements.
The last two Budgets deferred increases caused by transitional payments,
keeping the increase in rates to businesses to the rate of inflation for
last year and this year.
Retailers were particularly affected because the value of shops rose by a
greater level than other commercial premises between the rate valuations in
1973 and 1980. The next valuation is due in 1995.
Mr Goodchild said businesses were likely to lobby the government to limit
rate increases to inflation again.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Borrowers' new issues at Pounds 3.1bn last month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW ISSUES by borrowers in the UK for September totalled Pounds 3.1bn, the
Bank of England said yesterday.
UK borrowers' new issues denominated in sterling were Pounds 2.8bn. Sterling
issues by overseas borrowers were Pounds 527m.
The figures reflect the reliance being placed on capital markets and are
important in determining the Bank's estimates about the demands on the money
supply.
The largest issue during the month was the Pounds 405m rights issue by
Scottish &amp; Newcastle.
Actual gross issues by UK borrowers during September were Pounds 2.4bn, with
redemptions of Pounds 1.2bn and net issues of Pounds 1.3bn.
Gross issues in sterling by overseas borrowers were Pounds 357m, with net
issues of Pounds 337m.
The largest fixed-rate sterling bond issues during the month were Pounds
500m from British Telecommunications and Pounds 255m by the Province of
Ontario.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Property revival 'losing steam': Housing market offers
little cheer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REVIVAL in the housing market, an important component in restoring
consumer confidence, appeared to lose steam over the past three months, a
survey by Halifax building society showed yesterday.
Price rises petered out and the society's estate agents said poor business
in August continued into September.
Only two regions recorded a rise in prices over the third quarter of 1992,
while nationally prices were 2 per cent down.
The quarterly data contrasts with last week's monthly figures from Halifax,
the UK's largest mortgage lender, which showed the first increase in
September since January 1991.
'The general improvement in regional house prices reported in the second
quarter has not been sustained in the latest quarter with average prices
either falling or growing more slowly,' the society said.
'The underlying regional picture of annual price inflation remains weak.'
Reports from estate agents in Halifax's network indicate generally modest
levels of activity over the summer months. As expected, the holiday month of
August was quiet.
'Furthermore, this appears to have continued into the last month of the
quarter, with most agents describing September as 'poorer than
anticipated'.'
Housebuilders have also been concerned that the normal seasonal pick-up
after the end of the school summer holidays has not been as strong as they
had been expecting. Most are continuing to offer sales incentives to draw
buyers into the market.
The main problem, according to Halifax, is a shortage of new sellers with
people reluctant to move because of the uncertain economic outlook.
Only Northern Ireland recorded a significant rise in prices in the latest
quarter, with an increase of 7.5 per cent. However, the small number of
house sales in the province makes the margin for error in compiling figures
greater than for other regions.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Output hit by recession on the Continent: Manufacturing
production falls 0.4%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INDUSTRIAL recovery faltered during the summer as recession in
continental Europe caused manufacturing industry's production to drop in the
three months to the end of August.
The Central Statistical Office reported yesterday that manufacturing output
fell by a seasonally-adjusted 0.4 per cent in August and was only 1.1 per
cent higher than in August last year.
Because of strong output by gas, electricity and water companies and robust
production in the crude oil and natural gas sectors, overall industrial
production increased marginally by 0.1 per cent in August and was 2.3 per
cent higher than in August last year.
Taking figures for the latest three months, which the CSO regards as a
better guide to overall developments, manufacturing output in the June to
August period was 0.7 per cent lower than in the previous three months but
1.2 per cent up on the same period of last year.
Overall production was up 0.8 per cent compared with March to May,
reflecting a 17.7 per cent jump in oil and natural gas production as most of
the UK's oil fields returned to full production after summer maintainance
shutdowns.
It also reflected a 4.3 per cent rise in electricity, gas and water supply,
as a result of increased demand because of the cooler-than-average summer.
Total industrial production rose 2.6 per cent in June to August compared
with the same months last year. In the latest period, production by the
mining and quarrying industries increased 14.2 per cent, reflecting 24.3 per
cent growth in oil and natural gas extraction which more than offset a 26
per cent decline in coal output. Electricity, gas and water output in the
three months was 6 per cent higher than the year before.
CSO statisticians said industrial production in the latest three months may
have been slightly depressed by the late May bank holiday which resulted in
continuing plant holidays in June. But they scaled back their estimate of
the annual trend growth in output to about 1 per cent in August from 1.5 per
cent in July and around 5 per cent between March and May this year.
The Treasury was relatively unruffled by the decline in output, explaining
it reflected 'in large part the weakness in export markets'. Mr Stephen
Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said he believed that the UK
was 'still on course' to deliver growth of about 3 per cent by the middle of
next year.
However, the CSO figures showed that only one of the broad manufacturing
subsectors increased its output in the latest three months. This was the
coke, nuclear fuels and petrol refining sector which increased production by
2.3 per cent compared with March to May.
The textiles, leather and clothing industries reported unchanged output with
other broad subsectors reporting declines of up to 2 per cent in the case of
basic metals and metal products.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Mortgage scheme for council tenants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SCHEME to give council tenants a new way to buy their homes was launched
yesterday by Sir George Young, the housing minister.
The rents-to-mortgages initiative is aimed at about 1.4m council tenants who
pay full rent, as well as secure tenants of non-charitable housing
associations.
The scheme, previously tested in three pilot projects in 1991, allows
tenants to buy their homes by making an initial payment which is less than
the right-to-buy price. The rest of the cost does not have to be paid until
later, with mortgage repayments based on present rent levels.
Tenants paying Pounds 30 a week on a house valued at Pounds 50,000 for
example, would pay two-thirds of the right-to-buy price of Pounds 30,000,
based on their weekly rent. The tenant would then pay off the final third,
less a further discount, when the property is sold.
The campaign comes amid concerns about the position of council tenants who
have bought their homes but now find it difficult to sell, or who have had
problems in getting a mortgage.
A report from the Labour-dominated Association of London Authorities said
that local branches of banks and building societies were reluctant to lend
against ex-council flats, which were not seen as generally desirable
properties.
Mr John Battle, Labour's housing spokesman, said the scheme would not help
'the thousands of council leaseholders who are effectively trapped in homes
they cannot sell and cannot afford to renovate'.
There is also anxiety about the impact of any rise in interest rates on
those people targeted by the new initiative.
Mr John Wriglesworth, housing analyst at UBS, said that unless people were
properly warned about possible increases in interest rates, then the
'rents-to-mortgages scheme could turn into a rents-to-repossessions scheme'.
Shelter, the housing charity, said that with one-in-12 mortgages in arrears
and 300,000 with arrears of six months or more, it was worried that
low-income families could be persuaded to buy homes for which they could not
maintain payments.
Ms Sheila McKechnie, director, said: 'Too many people have already been
encouraged to buy their council houses without realising the full costs of
home ownership.
'Shelter does not want to see families exchanging a secure council tenancy
for a home which later they could lose if they cannot afford a mortgage.'
Sir George insisted that leaflets about the scheme gave enough warnings
about the costs of home ownership, including service charges and interest
rate changes.
He also said that the Department of the Environment had written to banks and
building societies and was confident that they would be prepared and willing
to give advances.
Sir George refused to set any target for judging the success of the
initiative.

FT  14 OCT 93 / BR clears way for leasing market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday moved to allay fears over the future of British
Rail's West Coast main line services after Network SouthEast won a year-long
battle for new trains which are to be financed under an innovative Pounds
150m leasing deal.
The deal ends speculation over how BR would use a special leasing concession
announced in last year's Autumn Statement, and will benefit up to 125,000
London commuters. It opens the way for the creation of a leasing market for
rolling stock and also safeguards for a year the jobs of more than 1,000
workers at ABB Transportation's York works, where the new trains will be
built.
InterCity's West Coast main line had been vying with Network SouthEast for
new trains, but BR has decided to use the concession to lease 41 new
four-coach Networker Express trains for Great Northern and Kent Coast
services. Existing Great Northern trains will be switched to the London,
Tilbury &amp; Southend line.
The announcement was criticised by opposition parties. Mr Nick Harvey,
Liberal Democrat transport spokesman, welcomed the investment in Network
SouthEast but said the future of the West Coast main line was now in
question.
Mr Roger Freeman, minister for public transport, said BR's decision did not
reflect any doubts over the importance of the West Coat line. He said he was
prepared to consider subsidising services on the line - even after it is
franchised in 1995 or 1996 - as part of rail privatisation.
He also stressed that the West Coast line's rolling stock would be replaced.
He said the Department of Transport and the Treasury wanted to discuss with
GEC Alsthom, the engineering group, its 'interesting new ideas' on leasing.
The Anglo-French group's bid to build 11 InterCity 225 trains had been
judged too expensive.

FT  14 OCT 93 / First estate agent fined over house description
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST estate agent to be prosecuted under the Property Misdescriptions
Act (1991) was fined Pounds 500 and ordered to pay costs of Pounds 570 by
magistrates in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, yesterday. The act is aimed at
eliminating misleading descriptions of properties.
Mr Ian Sinclair, a chartered surveyor who runs his own estate agency in the
Great Yarmouth area, had failed for five days to amend a newspaper
advertisement and a captioned photograph in his office window to say that
the asking price of a house in Gorleston had risen from Pounds 22,500 to
Pounds 25,000.
A member of the public interested in the property found that the price did
not tally with the advertisement and alerted the local trading standards
department which brought the prosecution.
Mr Sinclair pleaded guilty and elected not to be tried at a crown court. He
said the offence had happened through an administrative error because a new
member of staff had failed to alter the details of the sale.
The magistrates court has the power to impose a maximum fine of Pounds
5,000. After the hearing Mr Sinclair said: 'I am obviously very
disappointed. The fine is not punitive but it is not token either. I had
made a mistake and felt that I should have merely been cautioned.'
Mr Malcolm Patridge, Mr Sinclair's solicitor, said: 'The fine was much
higher than I expected but we will not be appealing.'
Mr Steve Holland, prosecuting solicitor, said he felt vindicated in bringing
the prosecution. 'There has been a substantial fine and I have been awarded
all my costs.'

FT  14 OCT 93 / Scots enterprise directors will publish interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIRECTORS of all local enterprise companies in southern Scotland are to have
their interests in decisions taken by their boards published in the
companies' annual reports.
The announcement was made yesterday by Scottish Enterprise, which
co-ordinates the local enterprise companies in Scotland outside the
Highlands. The companies are the equivalent of England and Wales' training
and enterprise councils.
The move follows disclosures by Scottish newspapers that businesses run by
enterprise company directors benefited financially from decisions made by
the enterprise companies' boards.
Recently it emerged that Forth Valley Enterprise based at Stirling had paid
Pounds 825,000 to organisations whose representatives sat on its board. The
news came out when the Falkirk Herald consulted a public register of the
interests of the enterprise company's directors.
Professor Donald MacKay, chairman of Scottish Enterprise, said that
directors of the 13 enterprise compnies declared an interest when the boards
were discussing issues in which they were directly affected, such as the
placing of contracts and the awarding of financial assistance.
The rules require that the directors withdraw when matters in which they may
benefit are being discussed. Some enterprise companies already publish their
directors' interests in their annual reports, while others have registers of
the interests available on request.
Prof MacKay said that Scottish Enterprise had investigated all cases where
it was alleged that directors had abused their positions, but had found no
evidence to support the claims. He added that enterprise companies would
publish declarations of interest in a standard form in their next annual
reports and would also use a standard format for the reports.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Ex-Timex staff may end dispute
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FORMER employees of Timex in Dundee will vote today on whether to accept ex
gratia payments from the US-based company to end the 10-month dispute that
led to the closure of the plant.
In spite of the shutdown of its Dundee operations, Timex has continued to
face industrial action including a global boycott from the strikers.
British Telecommunication's 9,000 telephone operators are to vote on taking
industrial action - including a possible strike - in a dispute over
allowance payments.
The union said BT had proposed the withdrawal of extra payments for duties
including night duty, weekend working and bank holidays.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Company probed on Iraq exports
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CUSTOMS and Excise officers have visited the premises of a company in Wales
in connection with allegations of suspected unlicensed exports to Iraq,
Jimmy Burns and Roland Adburgham write.
The move represents the first action by a British law enforcement agency
since the government two weeks ago confirmed it was revoking all export
licences to Iraq.
It emerged yesterday that customs officers on Monday entered premises linked
to the company, which cannot be named for legal reasons. They seized
documents as part of an international investigation into the alleged use of
fraudulent United Nations and Department of Trade and Industry documents.
The investigation concerns false statements of export volumes on goods
classified as humanitarian aid, which may have resulted in some companies
breaching UN trade restrictions and British export regulations.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Kuwait ministers set for tax talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KUWAITI finance and oil ministers plan to meet the government to discuss the
Pounds 600m in tax which Kuwait may owe on its investment in British
Petroleum shares.
'I understand they are due over here soon,' said a senior Kuwaiti adviser.
The Financial Times recently reported that Kuwait may have abused its
sovereign immunity from taxation in relation to its purchase in the late
1980s of a stake close to 22 per cent in BP.
It has received more than Pounds 600m in tax refunds on income from the
shares to which it may not have been entitled because the shares were
purchased by the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation and were not a direct
investment of Kuwait, as originally claimed.
The adviser said that it would be unwise for the UK to press for repayment
of the Pounds 600m, because UK exports to Kuwait, especially defence
contracts, could be jeopardised. He said it would be better for the two
countries to come to a 'mutual understanding'.
However, the UK government said there was no possibility of the Inland
Revenue ceasing its investigation of the tax. It added: 'There is no way the
Treasury or Foreign Office can intervene in an investigation of this kind.'

FT  14 OCT 93 / Sixties buccaneer deals in high-tech piracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN HIS DAYS as a Radio Caroline pirate broadcaster Mr Chris Cary was known
as Spangles Muldoon. Now he drives a blue Rolls-Royce, number plate THE 60S,
and runs a multi-million-pound business from an industrial unit in
Camberley, Surrey - although he describes himself as a consultant.
Mr Cary, who is also chairman of Buzz FM, the Birmingham commercial radio
station, has come a long way from his pirate radio days but he still has the
air of the buccaneer.
The Camberley company's main line of business is the manufacture and sale of
unauthorised decoders and decoder cards for a large number of continental
European subscription television channels.
If you want to watch the scrambled pictures of Scandinavian channels such as
TV 1000 or the three channels of TV3 complete with pornography or films
channels such as FilmNet (broadcast in English) or Filmmax, Mr Cary is your
man.
In the past seven years Mr Cary says he has turned over Pounds 30m and made
more than 230,000 unauthorised decoder boxes. 'It was like selling sweets,'
Mr Cary says.
However, he would like to change direction and is offering to sell his
piracy system to those behind EuroCrypt - the system that he is breaking.
He said: 'I want EuroCrypt to buy me out. It would be worthwhile provided no
one else has pirated it from me. If they were to buy it for Pounds 5m they
would be buying something worth Pounds 25m.
'Our system is fantastic and needs to be nipped in the bud.'
Yesterday the Financial Times called Hi-Tech Innovative Electronics, a
company run from Mr Cary's Camberley premises, and asked for a card to
unscramble the main European channels.
A woman said the combined card, which would unscramble TV3, TV 1000, FilmNet
and Filmmax, would cost Pounds 200.
'It's good. And we guarantee the card for a year,' she said, adding that the
company took all leading credit cards.
The 'guarantees' are needed because the satellite broadcasters are always
trying to disable pirate cards.
A consultant for a large accountancy firm, who asked not to be named, said
that when he came back from holiday he found that counter-measures had been
taken and his Hi-Tech card no longer worked.
'I put the old card in the post last Wednesday and the new combined one
arrived last Friday,' he said.
Mr Cary said that originally it had taken him a week to crack FilmNet and
another week to crack the Sky Television scrambling system VideoCrypt. Sky
had changed its system twice but pirate operators had produced a substitute
card within days.
The integrity of scrambling systems for satellite channels is vital not just
for the channel's finances but also for access to film rights. The US
studios sell film rights on a country-by-country basis and would be
reluctant to provide films, say for UK film channels, if they were going to
be pirated all over Europe.
Mr Cary said that widespread piracy of the VideoCrypt card used by Sky (in
which Pearson, owners of the Financial Times, has a significant stake)
represented a Pounds 100m problem for the company.
'I'm horrified for them. It's the biggest problem they are ever going to
have. It's their moneybox,' said Mr Cary, who believes that Sky may have to
change the processor in its system and start all over again.
Last week the FT bought an unauthorised card for all the Sky subscription
channels from Satellite Decoding Systems, a company in Warrington, Cheshire,
run by Mr David Lyons. Sky Television has already issued a writ against the
company.
Mr Cary, who claims to have acted as a consultant on piracy to 'a lot of big
companies', said he would like to turn gamekeeper and sell his expertise to
companies such as FilmNet, which he sees as a limited business in the UK,
and advise on anti-piracy measures.
'We don't want to be pirates,' he said.
He plans to change the name of the company to Key TV to get away from the
past.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Major's press secretary to leave
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, yesterday signalled a fresh attempt to
rebuild the government's battered public image by appointing a senior
diplomat to replace his outgoing press secretary.
Mr Major said that Mr Gus O'Donnell, his press secretary for four years,
would be replaced in January by Mr Christopher Meyer, Britain's deputy
ambassador in Washington.
Mr O'Donnell, a career economist, is leaving to take up a senior Treasury
post. He is thought to have been seeking an opportunity to return to the
Treasury where he used to work, partly to avoid becoming too closely
identified with the prime minister and the Conservative party.
Mr Meyer, a highly respected diplomat who was head of the Foreign Office
press office from 1984 to 1989, has been deputy head of mission in
Washington since last year.
The prime minister said he was 'very sad' about the departure of Mr
O'Donnell who had done 'a difficult job with great skill and good humour'.
But the appointment was welcomed by rightwingers, many of whom believe Mr
O'Donnell bears some of the blame for the government's presentational
difficulties over the last year.
One senior backbencher said: 'There has been considerable criticism about
the prime minister's private office, and many of us have been looking for
changes.'
Another blamed Mr O'Donnell for remarks attributed to the prime minister in
which rightwing backbenchers were dismissed as 'barmy'. He said the change
could 'only be an improvement'.
Downing Street denied suggestions that Mr O'Donnell had been forced out to
appease the right. He is to become head of the Treasury monetary group,
which advises on interest rates and exchange rate policy.
Mr O'Donnell was working on monetary aggregates at the Treasury when he was
promoted to press secretary by Lord Lawson, the then chancellor. He remained
in the job when Mr Major became chancellor in 1989, and moved with him to 10
Downing Street.
Mr O'Donnell has told friends that he has 'bitter-sweet' feelings about
leaving Number 10, but is pleased to be returning to a 'fun' job at the
Treasury.
Mr Meyer, a fluent Russian speaker and expert on Russian politics, is
described by colleagues as an intelligent high flier destined for the top of
diplomatic service.
Mr Major said that Mr Meyer's 'fine record' in Washington and his experience
in the Foreign Office press office would 'stand him in good stead for this
challenge'.
Like Mr O'Donnell, Mr Meyer will be able to indulge the prime minister's
love of sport. He plays tennis and squash, and is a supporter of Brighton
and Hove Albion Football Club.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Business chambers in Kent join forces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMALL CHAMBERS of commerce in Kent are joining together to promote the
county's attractions as a business centre in competition with continental
markets.
The formal establishment of the single European market and the opening of
the Channel tunnel next year highlight the need for more effective business
support in the county.
The creation of the Kent Chamber of Commerce and Industry is intended to
boost local industry's exports, improve the quality of business information
and strengthen training.
Kent's fragmented chamber network, just across the Channel from powerful,
publicly funded chambers in France and Belgium, has long been regarded as an
example of the weakness of the British system.
Six of Kent's smaller chambers, including Maidstone and Dover, with a
combined membership of 1,500 businesses, have combined to form the new
chamber and talks are continuing to bring in a further five, including
Dartford, Ashford and Canter-bury.
Mr Graham said that if agreement could be reached between all 11 chambers,
the Kent chamber would have a membership of 3,000 businesses and rank third
among UK chambers after Birmingham and Thames Valley.

FT  14 OCT 93 / National Grid proposes discounts for cut-offs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK HOUSEHOLDS could reduce their electricity bills by opting to install
special meters that cut off some domestic appliances during periods of peak
demand, according to proposals put forward by the National Grid yesterday.
The Grid, which runs the electricity transmission system in England and
Wales, also asked large industrial users to consider signing up to be cut
off at short notice in return for savings on their annual bills of around 10
per cent.
The proposals mark the latest move to increase the flexibility of the
electricity supply system where power generation is currently in the hands
of the duopoly made up by National Power and PowerGen.
National Grid currently pays Pounds 310m a year to the two generators for a
series of back-up services required to run a safe, and economic electricity
supply. These costs are, in turn, passed on to consumers.
If large users, and eventually, domestic customers, agree to be cut off
during peak periods, the Grid will not require certain back-up services such
as plant held in reserve (by the generators) to meet surges in demand.
'By securing an alternative supply for these vital services, we are
expanding competition into this area.
'There is a potential for significant cost reductions,' Mr Charles Davis,
the Grid's commercial manager, said at a seminar for 100 representatives of
the UK's largest electricity-using businesses.
At the same meeting, speakers from Florida outlined the state's success in
getting domestic consumers to agree to be cut off at certain times. They
estimated that by the year 2000 all of the state's reserve requirements will
be provided in this way.
However, UK industry experts said that the metering technology for
households to be involved in such a scheme is expensive.
National Power welcomed the Grid's proposals, but said the room for cost
savings was limited as a certain number of back-up services could be
provided only by power stations.

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE desire of the Clinton administration to raise the federal minimum wage,
restated this week by Mr Robert Reich, labour secretary, is meeting stiff
business resistance, writes Jurek Martin in Washington.
Mr Reich said he was thinking of recommending a rise of 50 cents to Dollars
4.75 an hour, but he said some of the increment might be accounted for by
new healthcare benefits for the low-paid. The last rise, from Dollars 3.80
an hour, was in 1991.
Nearly 5m Americans are being paid the federal minimum, or less. Mr Reich,
arguing this base figure was worth 30 per cent less in real terms than 25
years ago, doubted an increase would have any negative impact on
unemployment.
However, spokesmen for small businesses, especially the hotel, fast-food
restaurant and retail trades, countered that job losses were inevitable.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UN Security Council last night ordered a renewal of sanctions against
Haiti unless the military junta complies with its agreement to permit the
deployment of a UN peace mission leading to the return to office of exiled
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
An oil embargo and freeze of Haiti's assets abroad will go into effect on
Monday if General Raul Cedras, the military chief, fails to step down
tomorrow in accordance with the agreement, which also provides for UN troops
to land.
A shipload of US and Canadian soldiers assigned to retrain the military and
police was prevented from disembarking on Monday by unruly Haitian
demonstrators believed to be acting with the military's encouragement.
The Security Council's mandatory resolution, adopted unanimously, responded
to a request by the US and a written recommendation by Mr Boutros Boutros
Ghali, UN secretary general. He reported 'serious and consistent
non-compliance' with the agreement brokered by his special envoy, Mr Dante
Caputo, a former Argentine foreign minister, and a repeated 'lack of will'
by the military to facilitate UN operations.

<DATELINE>
   PORT OF SPAIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Manuel Esquivel, prime minister of Belize, is to ask Britain for further
assurances of military support if the Central American country is threatened
by neighbouring Guatemala.
Mr Esquivel, who will visit Britain between Sunday and Wednesday of next
week for discussions with government officials, said he was increasingly
concerned at continued instability in Guatemala, where the congress and the
supreme court have rejected a demand from President Ramon de Leon Carpio
that they resign.
'All this could provide an opportunity for those elements in Guatemala which
always want to raise the issue of Guatemalan claims to Belize,' Mr Esquivel
said. 'All this concerns us as it could result in the overturning of former
President Jorge Serrano's recognition of Belize.'
Guatemala's 130-year-old territorial claim to Belize was ended last year by
a pact between the then-president Serrano and Mr George Price, the former
premier of Belize, in which Guatemala recognised Belize as an independent
nation.
Worries that the Guatemalan military might invade Belize in pursuit of the
territorial claim led to the stationing of a 1,500-strong UK garrison in
Belize. Earlier this year the British government said it intended to
withdraw the garrison, but would use the facilities for military training.
The garrison has contributed significantly to the economy of Belize. Mr
Esquivel said a new budget next month would take account of the impending
loss of income, as well as under-estimated expenditure and overstated
revenue in the previous budget.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Family creditor could upset Brazilian debt negotiations:
Stephen Fidler looks at the role of a private non-bank investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN IMPASSE between the Brazilian government and its fourth largest private
foreign creditor - the Dart family of the US - emerged this week after
Brazil rejected the family's offer to participate in the country's
commercial bank debt restructuring.
The family holds around Dollars 1.4bn in face value of bank loans to Brazil,
or about 4 per cent of the commercial bank debt covered by the
restructuring. It describes the debt - bought at a discount in the secondary
market over the last two years - as a long-term investment. The family owns
Dart Container and made its fortune from the development of the polystyrene
cup.
The deadlock could, if not resolved, delay completion of the accord. It also
raises questions about the growing proportion of developing country bank
loans now in the hands of private non-bank investors.
Restructuring agreements have for more than a decade been negotiated by
leading creditor banks appointed by debtor governments sitting on a
so-called advisory committee. Non-bank investors have never been asked to
sit on a committee, although they now often hold more than half of the
outstanding bank debt.
In a statement this week, the Dart family complained that it 'was never
consulted during the negotiations that resulted in the Brazil financing
plan' despite its position as the fourth-largest holder of Brazilian debt.
However, from the banks and the debtor governments' point of view, the
emergence of private investors may further complicate the already agonising
process of debt restructuring. For one thing, such private investors are not
susceptible to the persuasion from bank supervisors which has been evident
in past restructuring agreements.
Brazil is the last of the big four Latin American debtors - after Mexico,
Venezuela and Argentina - to be negotiating a debt reduction accord, but the
deal could have an impact on future debt accords. Debt settlements for Peru
and Ecuador, for example, have yet to be reached.
The dispute has arisen over the restructuring of Dollars 35bn in debt. Terms
were negotiated between the government and an advisory committee of 19
banks, but the completion of the accord is still awaiting, among other
things, the final agreement of the hundreds of creditors that hold the debt.
Creditors were offered the choice between six types of financial instrument
aimed at reducing the country's debt burden. Brazil negotiated the right to
request changes in the eventual allocations because some instruments implied
a higher cost to the country than others.
The Dart family said this week that when the restructuring plan was first
announced in September 1992, they were encouraged by the Brazilian
government to exchange their loans for bonds which did not carry collateral.
US Treasury zero coupon bonds are to be pledged against some of the options
to guarantee principal or some interest payments, and the government was
worried about the cost of this collateral.
The family opted for so-called 'C' Bonds, 20-year instruments which carry
interest rates of 4 to 5 per cent for the first six years and 8 per cent for
the rest of their lives. The difference between 8 per cent and the lower
interest rates in the bonds' early years is rolled up into capital.
The Darts calculate that by choosing this option, they would save Brazil
more than Dollars 200m in up-front capital costs that would have been needed
to buy the collateral. Nonetheless, they were asked to shift their choice by
the government. According to their statement, the Darts refused, professing
satisfaction with their original commitment. This week Brazil 'had seen fit
to reject that commitment'.
A spokeswoman emphasised that the shifting of options was voluntary. She
said the family now regarded the 'chapter as closed' and would expect Brazil
to service its existing credits. The response from the Brazilian side is as
yet unclear.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Argentina hopeful over Falklands poll

THE Falkland Islands go to the polls today, with a record 25 candidates
competing for the eight seats on the local council.
The elections are arousing particular interest in Argentina, which fought a
74-day war over the Falklands with Britain in 1982, and still claims
sovereignty over the islands.
Mr Guido di Tella, Argentina's foreign minister, claims the elections will
bring a more 'enlightened' group of councillors to power who will be more
willing to talk to Argentina.
However, the chances are that such hopes will be disappointed. None of the
candidates, who run as individuals rather than under the party banner, is
willing to have more contact with Argentina than is strictly necessary until
it drops its sovereignty claim.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Guzman 'peace offer' may bring end to Peru terror: Sally
Bowen on imprisoned guerrilla leader's videotape call for his followers to
end their struggle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE long war waged by hard-line Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) guerrillas
against the Peruvian state could be drawing to a close that would have been
inconceivable little more than a year ago.
President Alberto Fujimori made public at the weekend a video recording in
which Abimael Guzman, Sendero's founder-leader, repeated his call for peace
talks. In a script which could almost have been written by Mr Fujimori
himself, Mr Guzman admitted the success of the Peruvian government's
counter-subversion strategy, 'especially in the area of intelligence.'
Mr Guzman said his capture and that of other high-ranking Sendero leaders
had raised 'fundamental questions of leadership' within the organisation.
The party confronted 'a great and historical decision,' he said. With the
same 'firmness and resolution' that they had embarked upon the 'people's
war' 13 years ago, they should now 'fight for a peace accord,' he said.
The self-styled 'fourth sword of Marxism' (after Marx, Lenin and Mao),
however, has not recanted. On the contrary, he claimed to have used classic
communist concepts to 'make a concrete analysis of a concrete situation.'
Mr Fujimori, for his part, has repeated what he said in his address to the
UN general assembly on September 30 - that there can be no negotiations,
only 'conversations.' Mr Guzman, after all, has been convicted of terrorism
and, under Peruvian law, sentenced to life imprisonment; Sendero Luminoso
has never been accorded belligerent status. Concessions would be limited to
a relaxation of Mr Guzman's rigorous prison conditions, which appear to have
affected him profoundly.
In the video recording, the long-feared Sendero leader looked a shadow of
his former combative self. Clean-shaven, smartly dressed, much slimmer and
with his greying hair apparently tinted, he was filmed alongside companion
and chief lieutenant Ms Elena Iparraguirre, obediently copying out his peace
letter and signing it.
Although Mr Fujimori coyly refuses to confirm it, the psychological victory
over Mr Guzman seems to belong to Mr Vladimiro Montesinos, the shadowy
former army captain who has become the president's chief adviser. Mr
Montesinos first made contact with Mr Guzman last October in the early days
of his captivity when their conversations ranged over philosophy, history
and politics. In recent months, Mr Montesinos has frequently been the
president's emissary to the Callao naval prison.
It seems clear from the recent series of Guzman-Iparraguirre videos that Mr
Montesinos succeeded in winning their confidence. Part of what Mr Fujimori
called the 'psychological war' against Mr Guzman included allowing the pair
to celebrate Ms Iparraguirre's birthday together. Mr Fujimori himself sent a
cake and a small personal gift.
Military experts interpret the two Guzman letters as a message to Sendero
militants that the 'sixth plan' - which commenced in January 1992 and which
the captured Mr Guzman had previously urged followers to continue with -
should be abandoned.
Some analysts believe the 'peace offer' may be a strategy to allow the
hard-hit organisation to gain time and regroup.
But, even if it is sincere, it may not be obeyed. An anonymous member of
Sendero's 'metropolitan committee,' quoted in a Lima magazine, denounced the
videos as 'a government trick to deceive the people.' He said the armed
struggle would continue and forecast attacks in the near future against
banks and selected government officials.
Within hours of the most recent video broadcast, a Sendero column attacked a
village in Ayacucho province and hacked 15 villagers to death in reprisal
for forming an army-backed civilian militia.
'In far-flung areas of Peru, it may take longer for pacification to come
about,' Mr Fujimori said.
The government is planning to modify the current 'repentance laws' to
encourage more disaffected Sendero supporters to surrender. Sendero expert
Mr Carlos Tapia estimates some 600 militants have been killed and another
2,400 captured, accounting for about two-thirds of the group's active
combatants. Few have voluntarily surrendered.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Greenspan warns against cutting Fed autonomy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ATTEMPTS by Congress to reduce the independence of the US Federal Reserve
would be a 'major mistake,' Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, warned
yesterday. He was reacting to proposals by a congressional committee to make
regional Fed presidents political appointees.
Mr Greenspan said the Fed's structure reflected a fine balance between
federal and regional, public and private interests. More political control
over interest rates would 'impart an inflationary bias to the economy and
could lead to instability, recession, and economic stagnation'.
He argued that most countries were taking steps, or considering action, to
increase the independence of their central banks.
Mr Greenspan did, however, concede that greater efforts were needed to lift
the pace at which women and minorities were promoted to senior posts within
the Fed system.
The Fed chairman was giving testimony at a congressional hearing called by
Mr Henry Gonzalez, the Democratic chairman of the house banking committee.
Mr Gonzalez has proposed legislation that would give President Bill Clinton
power to appoint the presidents of the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks,
subject to confirmation by the Senate.
The regional presidents play an important role in US monetary policy
because, in rotation, they hold five of the 12 seats on the Federal Open
Market Committee, the body that sets US short-term interest rates. The rest
are held by the seven Washington-based Fed governors.
Under current rules, regional presidents are elected by the boards of the
regional Fed banks. A majority of directors of these boards are elected by
local private-sector banks.
Mr Gonzalez and many other legislators say this makes the Fed an
undemocratic and unaccountable institution. It is the only branch of
government where private citizens are allowed to play an important role in
determining public policy.
Mr Greenspan has been careful to maintain cordial relations with the Clinton
administration, which shows no sign of supporting congressional initiatives
to reduce the Fed's independence.
However, Republicans are also uneasy about the Fed's anomalous structure. At
yesterday's hearing, Mr Jim Leach, the ranking Republican member of the
banking committee, said the present system was 'indefensible'. He drew
attention to the Fed's regulatory responsibilities, and said it was unseemly
that private-sector bankers were effectively regulating themselves.
He opposed Mr Gonzalez's proposed reform, arguing that public accountability
could be assured by the less drastic step of making the Fed governors (who
are appointed by the White House) responsible for appointing the regional
presidents.
Mr Greenspan rejected Mr Leach's proposal, arguing that it was unwise to
tamper with a system working well.
Under present rules, Fed governors confirmed the appointment of regional Fed
presidents and, if necessary, could demand their resignation.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Anti-trust extension 'could increase conflict with UK'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW ORLEANS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A US Supreme Court ruling that extends US anti-trust laws to the activities
of London-based reinsurers could lead to increased conflict between the UK
and the US, a British trade official has warned.
At the end of June the Supreme Court ruled that US courts had jurisdiction
over alleged collusive action between reinsurers at Lloyd's and US primary
insurers, even though the alleged behaviour of the Lloyd's underwriters
conformed to the UK's insurance regulatory regime.
Mr Edmund Hosker, who is based at the British embassy in Washington, told
the International Bar Association meeting in New Orleans that the most
troubling aspect of the decision was that it was a retreat from a previous
position, which required US courts to balance the competing interests of
jurisdictions involved before assuming jurisdiction itself.
There had been conflict between the US and UK over anti-trust issues before,
most noticeably the Westinghouse uranium case in the 1970s which resulted in
the UK's passing a blocking statute to reduce the impact of US anti-trust
laws on UK companies.
Mr Hosker said he feared the Supreme Court decision would encourage state
authorities and private plaintiffs in the US to launch anti-trust cases
against foreign companies over activities which were entirely acceptable
under their own regulatory regimes.
'I fear it may also reduce the incentive to co-operate with US regulatory
authorities in the anti-trust sphere and could result in foreign governments
making wider use of blocking statutes,' he said.
The Supreme Court had indicated there was not a conflict between the UK and
US in the reinsurance case, but the British government had made it clear in
three amicus briefs filed with the courts that restrictions on UK reinsurers
operating in US markets did create a conflict.
'If the position is reversed it is difficult to see the US not complaining,'
he said.
Mr Hosker said the only way to limit potential for conflict was to continue
efforts to increase co-operation between US and UK competition authorities.
Ms Diane Wood, the US deputy assistant attorney general for trade policy,
said Mr Hosker was exaggerating the potential for conflict over the issue.
There were always going to be overlaps of jurisdiction, she said, but that
did not necessarily mean an increase in conflict.

FT  14 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Alternative port in storm over Hong Kong -
Simon Davies on the implications of development plans for a mainland
entrepot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN SPITE of Hong Kong governor Chris Patten's warnings last week of the
enormous costs to both China and Hong Kong of delays to the expansion of the
colony's port, Beijing must be feeling more sanguine about the issue.
The day before Mr Patten's comments last Wednesday, one of Hong Kong's most
influential businessmen signed up for an almost identical project in
Yantian, which is just eight miles east of the territory's border with
China.
The acquisition of control of Yantian's port by Mr Li Ka-shing's Hutchison
Whampoa group - a deal witnessed by China's premier Li Peng - inevitably
raises concerns over whether Hong Kong's role as China's entrepot can be
replicated.
As Mr Patten told Hong Kong's Legislative Council last week, the colony's
port remains crucial to its economic development. It employs 350,000 people
and generates 15 per cent of the colony's gross domestic product.
The boom in export processing in the Pearl River delta has been the main
driving force behind Hong Kong's economy in recent years. In 1992, Hong
Kong's throughput in TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units) grew 29 per cent,
making it the busiest container port in the world. Trade expands apace and
the existing terminals will reach full capacity by mid-1995.
This coincides with the planned completion of Container Terminal 9 (CT9),
but as China continues to argue that its approval is necessary - ruling out
funding for the consortia who were awarded the HKDollars 10bn (Pounds 850m)
project - it is clear that it will not be operational until 1996. As Mr
Patten warned: 'Ships will be turned away, and they may not return to use
our port.'
At the same time, rising costs and increasing congestion in the colony have
already added to the attraction of constructing facilities in mainland
China, which would be both cheaper and closer to the source of production.
The newly-capitalised Yantian International Terminals will have constructed
five 50,000-ton container berths by the end of 1995, creating handling
capacity of 1.7m TEUs.
The proposed CT9 will have four berths with capacity of 1.8m TEUs; but its
estimated cost is about double the Yn5bn (at the official swap centre rate)
being invested in Yantian.
The Hutchison group, which controls around 60 per cent of Hong Kong's
container throughput, has in effect hedged its bets. It will be a
participant in Terminal 9, but it has also purchased 50 per cent of the port
operations in the cities of Shanghai and Zhuhai - to the north of Macao -
and it controls a consortium which will own 70 per cent of Yantian.
According to Mr John Meredith, managing director of Hutchison subsidiary
Hongkong International Terminals (HIT), the group is not anticipating future
changes, but reacting to demand which already exists.
In the case of Zhuhai, which will remain a feeder port, HIT will bring in
more container business for Hong Kong, while the port in Shanghai is too
distant to be deemed a serious competitor.
Yantian, however, is one of only four international deep water ports
designated by China, and it has the draught and infrastructure to absorb
substantial shipping business which might otherwise go through the colony.
Mr Meredith said: 'When we looked at Yantian five years ago, people only
wanted to use Hong Kong. Now the demand is there.'
Hong Kong does maintain substantial advantages to justify the higher costs
of both construction and utilisation. Mr Tony Clark, secretary of Hong
Kong's Port Development Board, maintains that it would take up to 10 years
before China's ports could pose a competitive threat because of their
tangled bureaucracy, inadequate infrastructure and lack of shipping support
services.
Yantian, however, has rail and road links already in place, and it will have
a bonded zone, enabling it to by-pass customs procedures and operate as a
trans-shipment centre. And it will be cheap.
Hong Kong operators remain confident that the cake is growing so rapidly
that there is enough for everyone. The Hong Kong government has forecast
that its overall port traffic will increase by an annual average of 8 per
cent between 1990 and 1996.
Mr Clark said: 'Looking at the amount of cargo originating from southern
China, it is very clear that Hong Kong alone will not be able to cope. China
will need more than Hong Kong to sustain its trade.' This assumes Hong Kong
is able to maintain the capacity and efficiency of its port in the face of
the new competition, but the political impasse over Terminal 9 demonstrates
no such assurance.
Mr Patten claimed that if the project was delayed by just two years, Hong
Kong's economy would lose HKDollars 20bn in the decade after 1997. With the
signing of the Yantian deal, the resolution of the Terminal 9 dispute may
have become less pressing for either Hutchison or Beijing. For Hong Kong,
the outcome remains critical.

<TEXT>
THE European Community and spirits-exporting countries have given Japan a
deadline of next April to meet its obligation under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade to harmonise its liquor taxes.
The deadline was presented to Japanese officials by a delegation of
international spirits exporters and comes six years after a Gatt ruling that
Japanese liquor taxes discriminate against imports. 'When the trade
imbalance of the EC and Japan is in excess of Dollars 30bn (Pounds 19.8bn),
the implementation of the 1987 Gatt ruling is one of tremendous importance
to us,' said Mr Ron Brown, chairman of the European Business Community
Liquor Committee.
Whisky and brandy pay six to nine times more tax than shochu, a traditional
liquor. Imported spirits account for 8 per cent of the Japanese market,
compared with 30 to 40 per cent of other developed countries with a uniform
tax system for all spirits, according to the European Confederation of
Spirits Producers.

FT  14 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Kohl rails against protectionism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN Chancellor Helmut Kohl told the French Senate yesterday that
Europeans should 'resist the temptation of protectionism', in a speech
designed to influence France's position in the Uruguay Round of world trade
talks.
Chancellor Kohl's call won swift praise from Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade
representative, who was holding negotiations with the EC in Brussels on the
Uruguay Round.
Mr Kohl, stressing the need for freer trade particularly with east Europe,
said: 'West Europeans would be committing a fatal error if they thought that
in removing competition by closing their markets they could benefit in any
way whatsoever'.
Mr Kantor said he was pleased Mr Kohl was 'seized with the importance of
restoring growth in Europe' and emphasised that 'increased competition
rather than building a wall around the EC is an absolute necessity'.
Mr Kantor took a firm line on French demands that the US-EC Blair House
agreement on cutting Europe's subsidised farm exports be amended: 'We are
not going to reopen or renegotiate the Blair House agreement,' he said.
Meanwhile in Paris, in a speech to the National Assembly, Prime Minister
Edouard Balladur yesterday gave little sign of conceding on the substance of
France's demands.
Calling for government and opposition parties to unite to defend 'our
country's national interests', Mr Balladur cited unfulfilled demands on
steel, aerospace, transport and market access, and warned that France would
not allow itself to be 'forced to take one extra hectare of land out of
production' when countries such as the US were putting set-aside land back
into production.
Mr Balladur said France would settle for a Gatt accord in the form of 'a
progress report' by the December 15 negotiating deadline 'if certain
partners were to propose this'.
He thus appeared to back away from the campaign that his ministers have been
waging in recent days for an 'interim Gatt' deal this year, leaving the
contentious issues of agriculture and broadcasting for later.
Mr Balladur and Mr Kohl, in Paris talks, discussed the possibility of
Germany using its influence with the US to mediate in the farm trade
dispute.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Congress is launching a direct attack against Canadian and EC
restrictions on US 'creative materials', raising yet another potential
obstacle to the timely conclusion of the Uruguay Round.
In a move to bolster growing US exports of copyrighted materials such as
films, television shows and computer software, 199 members of the House of
Representatives are co-sponsoring a resolution insisting that Mr Mickey
Kantor, US trade representative, gain 'fair and equal access' to
international markets.
The resolution implicitly targets both Canada's cultural restrictions and
the EC Broadcast Directive, which urges member states to ensure that at
least 50 per cent of programming is produced in Europe. The latter was on
the agenda in talks between Mr Kantor and Sir Leon Brittan, the EC trade
negotiator.
European officials have been hoping the US would, in the end, not make a
'round-breaker' of France's requirement that at least 60 per cent of its
programming be European.
An aide to Congressman Richard Gephardt, who introduced the measure,
predicted the resolution soon would attract more than a majority of the 435
members of the House.
The resolutions are non-binding, but they exert strong pressure on Mr
Kantor, who knows he must negotiate a Uruguay Round package that Congress
will pass. One trade strategist noted that they 'make our position much less
flexible, and that can be good or bad'.
The French, he added, have been 'incredibly provocative' with threats to
boycott US films to protect their movie industry.
Both resolutions cite trade in copyrighted goods as among the fastest
growing sectors of the US economy, accounting for about Dollars 34bn (Pounds
22.5bn) in export revenues in 1990. The proportion of US workers employed in
the copyright-based sector grew from 3.3 per cent in 1970 to 4.8 per cent in
1990, the resolution says.

<TEXT>
AN APOCALYPTIC future for European culture was painted by EC film producers
yesterday, if the cinema and audiovisual sectors are included in the Uruguay
Round of Gatt.
Figures from Europe's cinema industry lobbied the European Commission
yesterday to get the sector taken out of the Round, warning that unless it
is 'Europe will become a Third World continent,' in the words of Mr Wim
Wenders, the German film director.
The Commission says it is fighting for 'cultural specificity' for the films
and broacasting sector, allowing some protection and continuing subsidy.
France, with backing from other member states such as Spain wants a
'cultural exception' exempting cinema altogether.
Prospects last night brightened for France as the US and EC appeared to make
headway in Gatt talks in Brussels towards a compromise on trade in
audio-visual services.
Neither Sir Leon Brittan, EC chief trade negotiator, nor Mr Mickey Kantor,
US trade representative, would give details, but acknowledged progress had
been made on how to address problems in the sector.
EC negotiators had until recently sought in vain to exclude audio-visual
services from the Uruguay Round, but it now appears the EC is proposing the
sector should remain in the Round, but with the focus on abolition of EC
quota restrictions on imported films and television programmes.
This would allow European governments to continue subsidising entertainment
industries.
A range of mostly French industry groups argued yesterday that Europe would
be swamped by Hollywood in a Gatt-regulated open 'culture market'. They
pointed out that US film export revenues rose from Dollars 750m (Pounds
490m) in 1980 to Dollars 5.5bn last year, and that Dollars 3.7bn of 1992
sales were in Europe.
EC attempts to reserve most screening time on television to European work
has not blunted US penetration of the EC market, they said, contrary to US
claims that this was an illegal quota system.
Mr Wenders said that the audiovisual industry would be the biggest on the
planet in the next century. Europe had to decide whether its still modest
share would continue to exist or not, before the Uruguay Round mid-December
deadline. He said: 'To have a market dominated by American imagery means not
only domination by American values and American ideas, but that other
(EC-made) products would disappear,' because of concomitant US domination of
advertising.

culture industry seeks opt-out from Uruguay Round

AN APOCALYPTIC future for European culture was painted by EC film producers
yesterday, if the cinema and audiovisual sectors are included in the Uruguay
Round of Gatt.
Figures from Europe's cinema industry lobbied the European Commission
yesterday to get the sector taken out of the Round, warning that unless it
is 'Europe will become a Third World continent,' in the words of Mr Wim
Wenders, the German film director.
The Commission wants film and broadcasting to have the shield of Gatt rules,
and says it is fighting for 'cultural specificity' for the sector, allowing
some protection and continuing subsidy. France, with backing from other
member states such as Spain wants a 'cultural exception' exempting cinema
altogether.
A range of mostly French industry groups argued yesterday that Europe would
be swamped by Hollywood in a Gatt-regulated open 'culture market.' They
pointed out that US film export revenues rose from Dollars 750m (Pounds
490m) in 1980 to Dollars 5.5bn last year, and that Dollars 3.7bn of 1992
sales were in Europe.
EC attempts to reserve a majority of screening time on television to
European work has not blunted US penetration of the EC market, they said.
Mr Wenders said the audiovisual industry would be the biggest on the planet
in the next century. Europe had to decide whether its modest share would
continue to exist or not, before the Uruguay Round mid-December deadline.
'There is a war going on, and the most powerful weapons are images and
sound,' he said. 'To have a market dominated by American imagery means not
only domination by American values and American ideas, but that other
(EC-made) products would disappear,' because of concomitant US domination of
advertising.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC chief trade negotiator, was expected to discuss the
issue with US trade representative Mickey Kantor at a new round of Gatt
talks in Brussels yesterday.
US officials say they are relatively relaxed about subsidies for EC
film-makers, but would not agree to quotas or other impediments to US
audiovisual products entering the EC.
When the controversy was aired by EC foreign ministers last week, Sir Leon
insisted that leaving the sector outside Gatt would leave it vulnerable to
US trade reprisals - although Europe's film and TV industry earned US
revenues of only some Dollars 250m last year.
He picked up a reference from Mr Alain Juppe, France's foreign minister, to
Francophone Quebec securing a 'cultural exception' inside the US-Canada free
trade agreement, due to be carried over into the North American Free Trade
Agreement embracing Mexico. Sir Leon said this still left the Canadians
vulnerable to US '301' trade legislation.

THE decision by the US Congress to grant Most Favoured Nation status to
Romania has normalised relations between the two countries and will help
Bucharest continue with market-led reform, the Romanian government said
yesterday.
Tuesday's vote in the House of Representatives overturns a decision by
Congress last year. Other countries denied MFN status include Cuba, Vietnam
and North Korea. A few ex-Soviet republics are applying.
Since 1988, when dictator Nicolae Ceausescu unilaterally cancelled MFN,
Romanian exports such as furniture, glass and textiles have faced 35-90 per
cent US tariffs.

TYNESIDE consulting engineers Merz and McLellan are to resume work on the
2,400 MW Sabiya oil and gas fired power station in Kuwait, more than three
years after the Gulf War halted work on the project, Chris Tighe reports.
The company was awarded the station design and project management contract
in 1988, but Merz engineers were taken hostage in Kuwait at the outbreak of
the war.
The new Pounds 17.5m contract from Kuwait's Ministry of Electricity and
Water involves three years' work at Merz's Newcastle head office, and seven
years on site. Merz and McLellan also announced yesterday it had won power
station contracts worth Pounds 2.6m from Syria and Hong Kong.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Japan and Russia take step towards better relations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese government yesterday breathed a sigh of relief that relations
with Russia, traditionally regarded as a dangerous and untrustworthy
neighbour, had taken a step towards normality.
In spite of the bad omens for the three-day visit of Mr Boris Yeltsin, the
Russian president, which ended yesterday, the two nations claimed they had
made real progress towards ending nearly five decades of mutual hostility.
Their agreement to open negotiations on the future of four Pacific islands,
seized by Soviet troops at the end of the second world war, might seem
modest but it will attract wide attention among the Japanese public, which
values the Northern Territories, as the four Kurile islands are called in
Japan, as a symbolic national asset.
'President Yeltsin's visit has opened the first page towards normalising
relations ..We have established the foundation for new negotiations,' said
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister.
This could reduce the split between Japan and its partners in the Group of
Seven industrialised nations on how to handle Russia. Until yesterday, Japan
was in danger of being the only industrialised country not to have responded
to the end of the cold war by moving towards normal relations with Moscow.
The progress achieved on this visit, while short on concrete detail, will
strengthen Mr Yeltsin's legitimacy at home, as no doubt he intended.
It will also bolster the position of Mr Hosokawa, who had come under
opposition attack for allowing the visit to go ahead.
Officially, Japan continues to deny large-scale economic aid to Russia until
there is more substantial progress on the row over ownership of the islands.
Yet Japan has been unable to hold this line rigidly, under pressure from its
G7 partners which have been boosting aid to Russia to help its transition to
a market economy.
Pressure on Japan came to a head last April when Tokyo was chairman of a G7
emergency meeting on aid to Russia, at which it pledged Dollars 1.8bn
(Pounds 1.19bn). As a result, Japan is now Russia's third largest donor,
despite the islands dispute.
Thanks to the improvement in relations over the past few days, Japan will
now further increase the flow of aid to Russia, officials say.
But this will merely mean faster disbursement of the nearly Dollars 5bn so
far pledged, of which only 10 per cent has been paid out, they add.
Examples include a Japanese-financed Dollars 200m fibre-optic
telecommunications link between Moscow and the Russian far east, part of an
aid package agreed two years ago but yet to be implemented.
Separately, they signed an economic accord, in which Japan offered its
expertise to help Russia shift to a free market economy.
The accord listed 11 sectors for increased co-operation, including nuclear
power, space technology, environmental conservation, agriculture, transport
and communications.
They also agreed, for the first time, to seek foreign policy co-ordination,
'based on shared values,' the Japanese foreign ministry said.
The omens had indicated that any progress was unlikely. Mr Yeltsin had
snubbed his hosts by cancelling plans to visit Tokyo twice in the past 13
months, blaming the former LDP government's hard line over the islands.
Japan, meanwhile, was more interested in pouring money into China's
fast-developing economy.
Many people, especially in the LDP were suspicious that Mr Yeltsin had
chosen now to make good his promises to call on the Japanese government.
Coming only a week after using tanks to put down the rebels in Moscow, it
looked to some that Mr Yeltsin was pulling a propaganda stunt, at Japan's
expense, to demonstrate his confidence.
As Mr Yeltsin left Moscow, he confirmed Japan's worst misgivings by warning
that he hoped the Tokyo government would not spoil the visit by bringing up
the question of the islands.
Japanese officials felt as if a diplomatic earthquake was on the way. In the
event, Mr Yeltsin's arrival did coincide with a real earthquake, the worst
to hit Tokyo for several months.
But his surprisingly conciliatory stance, including an unscripted apology,
repeated several times, for Soviet treatment of Japanese prisoners of war,
left the diplomatic landscape rather improved.

AN intense effort by African and Islamic organisations to promote a Somalia
peace settlement will begin in Cairo today with the participation of Egypt's
President Hosni Mubarak and Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN
secretary-general, writes Michael Littlejohns at the UN in New York.
The meeting, to be attended by the secretaries-general of the Arab League,
the Organisation of African Unity and the Islamic Conference Organisation,
was to have been held in Addis Ababa next Wednesday but was advanced because
of the urgency of the crisis.
Meanwhile, new problems on the military side arose yesterday. Italy, which
has been at odds with the UN before over policy in Somalia, announced that
it hoped to pull out its contingents there and in Mozambique.
The UN spokesman urged Rome to reconsider.

FT  14 OCT 93 / UN settles for damage limitation in Somalia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOGADISHU
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED NATIONS' diplomats struggling to conjure a new policy for Somalia are
only certain of two things: they cannot afford any more deaths among
peacekeeping troops and they must find ways of blocking the departure of the
all-important US contingent.
Mr Kofi Annan, the UN chief of peacekeeping operations, was unable yesterday
to clarify the UN's aims in Somalia, in particular how it intended to deal
with the defiant warlord, Gen Mohamed Farah Aideed.
At a press conference in Mogadishu, he left the impression that the
30,000-strong military intervention in Somalia had become an exercise in
damage limitation.
'The level of fatalities is unsustainable and unacceptable,' Mr Annan said
of the 70 Blue Helmets who have been killed in Mogadishu since June.
'When governments begin to take casualties, the public outcry is difficult
for politicians and leaders to handle. We were not prepared, we did not
expect to encounter this level of violence.'
It was apparent that the UN was searching for formulas to scale down the
confrontation with the rebel warlord. Plans to put Gen Aideed on trial for
war crimes have been abandoned.
Instead, Mr Annan talked of having 'some sort of judicial process' that
would investigate Gen Aideed's responsibility for the killings of UN
soldiers in his south Mogadishu fiefdom.
Gen Aideed is unlikely to be pursued while he continues to hold a US
helicopter pilot and a Nigerian soldier captive. Washington, with its
history of hostage traumas, is suggesting an 'independent inquiry' into the
Mogadishu killings.
Many Somalis now believe that if Gen Aideed plays his hostage card
correctly, he will probably escape the rigours of a UN trial altogether.
Gen Aideed's unilateral ceasefire, which has given Mogadishu a few precious
days of peace, was briefly broken yesterday by an attack on a UN food convoy
guarded by Saudi troops.
Some food was looted, but there were no reports of casualties.
Mr Annan said President Bill Clinton's decision to pull out US troops from
Somalia in six months' time would 'weaken the UN operation considerably, if
not unravel it altogether.'
The timetable for withdrawal gives the UN little time to replace the largest
single contingent in Mogadishu with troops from other countries. Mr Annan
implied that it would be difficult to match US expertise in logistics and
air surveillance.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL and the Palestine Liberation Organisation yesterday began two months
of detailed negotiations in Cairo and Egypt's Red Sea resort of Taba to
implement their outline peace agreement.
In Taba, where Israeli and Palestinian security and military officials, once
bitter enemies, are meeting to prepare a protocol for Israeli military
withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho from December
13, the opening day of talks was marred when the Israeli delegation vetoed
three Palestinian delegates.
Israeli officials refused to sit across the table from Mr Amin al-Hindi, PLO
security chief, whom Israeli newspapers and security officials have accused
of helping to plan the massacre of Israelis at the 1972 Munich Olympic
games.
An Israeli foreign ministry official said: 'Munich was one of the greatest
traumas for Jews. We are prepared to make some compromises with Palestinians
but there is a limit.'
Two other delegates were vetoed because they live in Jerusalem, the most
sensitive issue between Israel and the PLO in future talks over territorial
jurisdiction. The three delegates were swiftly replaced by others in the
Palestinian party.
Both sides sought to play down the incident. Mr Nabil Shaath, head of the
PLO delegation, said: 'Nobody was blacklisted, nobody was white-listed ..we
have no problem about composition of the delegation.'
In a joint Israeli-PLO statement, Mr Shaath and Major-General Amnon Shahak,
head of the Israeli delegation, stressed the talks had been 'cordial and
constructive'.
The two sides agreed to set up two working groups to divide security from
civilian issues and to make the release of Palestinian prisoners held in
Israeli jails a 'priority matter'.
The two sub-committees will also focus on the territorial delimitation of
the Jericho area and the transfer of powers from the Israeli military-run
administration to a Palestinian interim authority.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, speaking to Israel Radio during a
visit to China, said the outcome of the Taba talks would be a test for
extending self-rule to other Palestinian areas captured by the Jewish state
in the 1967 war. 'Without meaningful progress in the committee to advance
Gaza-Jericho, all the rest will be simply marginal and secondary,' he said.
In separate talks in Cairo, the two sides set a tight timetable for further
detailed negotiations and established two additional committees on economic
and regional co-operation.
Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, wrapping up the first one-day
meeting of a joint PLO-Israeli liaison committee, said in Cairo: 'We shall
make a supreme effort to meet the time (for withdrawal) and if possible,
attempt to do so earlier'.
Both Mr Peres and Mr Mahmoud Abbas, (Abu Mazen), who headed the PLO
delegation, emphasised the 'positive' spirit of the talks, meeting privately
before the inaugural two-hour session of the liaison committee.
At both the Taba and Cairo meetings, sharp-suited Israeli and Palestinian
security agents milled side by side, stony faced, in the corridors of the
international hotels hosting the talks in what experts said was one of the
first public demonstrations of Israeli-Palestinian security co-operation.

Soldiers left the earthquake-devastated villages of India yesterday after
spending 12 days digging up bodies, building shelters and running community
kitchens, AP reports from New Delhi.
More than 10,000 troops from southern and western India went to the
districts of Osmanabad and Latur in Maharashtra on October 1, the day after
the earthquake flattened 83 villages.
Mr Sharad Pawar, the state's chief minister, said 9,748 people had died in
the earthquake.
Estimates of up to 30,000 casualties had been 'highly exaggerated,' he said.
The troops fought off looters, prevented epidemics in the relief camps and
erected corrugated tin sheet shelters for the thousands of homeless people.
The state government, meanwhile, has begun levelling 28 sites chosen to
relocate the devastated villages, and begun operating relief centres,
kitchens and clinics.

A STOCKBROKERS' strike yesterday halted trading on the Bombay Stock
Exchange, India's largest equity market, following repeated failures to
settle a dispute arising from last year's Rs42bn (Pounds 875m) securities
market scandal.
Brokers meet today to decide whether to continue their action which has
disrupted stock market dealings throughout India and undermines efforts to
build confidence in the capital markets.
The dispute started last month when income tax inspectors investigating the
affairs of Mr Harshad Mehta, the broker at the centre of the scandal, froze
dealings in specified blocks of stock in nine leading companies.
The inspectors' action has upset trading because brokers and investors alike
have become reluctant to deal in shares of the nine companies for fear of
handling tainted stock and unwittingly being drawn into the tax probe. Under
the BSE's trading rules, a broker buying stock only receives the share
certificates in the final stages of a transaction, after money has changed
hands.
So he cannot check whether he is receiving tainted stock until it is too
late. The affected shares include scrip issued by Reliance Industries, the
large chemicals and textiles combine, and ACC, a major cement producer.
Stock exchange officials lobbied the tax inspectorate to relax the freezing
order but the inspectors have declined, saying it might hamper their
investigations.
An attempt to have the matter resolved in the courts failed when the special
court established to try scandal-related cases this week refused to
arbitrate and referred the matter to the government. Finance ministry
officials were yesterday seeking ways of resolving the issue.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India said a solution would be found in
seven days. Officials of the board, the income tax department, the finance
ministry and the stock exchange are to meet tomorrow.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Kenya gets a lookover before foreign creditors meet: Leslie
Crawford on the visit of a World Bank team to assess whether Moi's
government has mended its financial ways
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WORLD Bank team was due in Kenya yesterday to begin assessing whether the
country has mended its financial ways sufficiently to merit the resumption
of international aid.
Kenya's chances of repairing relations with the donor community look better
now than at any time since the suspension of aid in November 1991.
President Daniel arap Moi's government has moved to curb the worst cases of
fraud and corruption in the banking and export sectors; fresh teams at the
treasury and central bank appear determined to fight inflation and restore a
measure of probity to government accounts; and economic reforms are moving
ahead.
'I believe enough has been done in terms of the basic framework to justify
the re-opening of a dialogue,' a World Bank official says. His cautious
remarks, however, speak volumes about the chasm of distrust that still
separates them.
Only six months ago, President Moi accused the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund of forcing 'dictatorial and suicidal reforms' on Kenya. But as
the aid squeeze took its toll, the president recanted.
The World Bank has agreed to chair a consultative group meeting of donors in
Paris next month. An IMF team is due in Nairobi soon to discuss the details
of a three-year economic reform programme which would form the basis of an
appeal for renewed assistance at the Paris meeting.
The World Bank is warning Kenya not to expect the aid floodgates to open
wide. 'A return to normal aid flows will depend on the delivery of results,'
says one World Bank economist.
'Kenya's relations with donor governments are so badly damaged that it will
need to establish a track record of sound economic management.'
What cannot be delayed for much longer, however, is a rescheduling of the
country's Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.57bn) foreign debt. Kenya has dealt with the
lack of external assistance by accumulating more than Dollars 500m in
debt-servicing arrears - the equivalent of about five months of export
revenues.
'Debt arrears are a millstone around our neck,' says Mr Micah Cheserem, the
central bank governor, who was appointed in July. 'We need creditors to
write off at least part of the arrears.' The 44-year-old governor, a former
accountant with Unilever, believes Kenya deserves a measure of debt
forgiveness, as debt service now consumes 30 per cent of export earnings.
The aid freeze has also left its mark on the once-vibrant economy, which has
in effect stagnated over the past two years and creates formal sector
employment for only a small fraction of the 400,000 job seekers entering the
labour market each year. The result has been rising crime, child beggars on
the streets of Nairobi, and hunger in the Rift Valley, where drought has
blighted the maize crop.
Kenyans are also suffering the aftermath of financial scandals that rocked
the banking system this year. Unsecured loans by the central bank to local
banks with ties to influential politicians led to a massive expansion of the
money supply and fuelled inflation.
In July, the government closed four of the scandal-tainted banks and started
placing high-interest treasury bills on the market to mop up excess
liquidity and curb inflation.
Inflation, however, is still running, on some estimates, at an annual rate
of 54 per cent, compared with 27 per cent at the end of 1992. The rate is
expected to fall only towards the end of the year.
'Nineteen ninety-three will not be a great year,' says Professor Terry Ryan,
an economic secretary at the treasury. The only bright spot, he says, is the
export sector which has benefited from devaluation of the shilling.
Estimates of Kenya's economic performance in 1993 vary from a contraction of
2 per cent to expansion of 2 per cent. Kenya's population grows by 3.4 per
cent a year.
But if Kenya is to reach agreement with the IMF, more unpalatable reforms
lie ahead: job losses in the civil service, parastatal reform, and the
abolition of the government's maize-marketing monopoly, with the attendant
loss of the government's ability to dispense political favours.
Mr Cheserem and Mr Musalia Mudavadi, the finance minister appointed in
January, say they are committed to an IMF-style structural adjustment
programme.
'I want to divorce politics from economic management,' Mr Cheserem says,
'and reduce opportunities for graft.'
Opposition economists, however, believe the new economic team lacks the
political clout to sustain painful reforms.
'Will (President) Moi find the political costs too high?' asks Mr Mwai
Kibaki, leader of the opposition Democratic party and a former finance
minister. 'Under pressure, Moi will promise many things, but he will not
change.'
Even Mr Cheserem admits that his independence depends on the president's
goodwill. He calls Mr Moi the country's 'chief economist' and says the
president wants policies that will generate employment. Given that IMF
programmes rarely create jobs in the short run, difficult negotiations lie
ahead.
Mr Moi told Kenyans on Sunday to be wary of foreign handouts. 'We cannot
risk relying on foreigners to develop our country because at most times,
their priorities are different from ours,' he said in an address to
celebrate 'Moi Day' and his 15 years in power.
In Paris next month, donors will be trying to establish exactly what those
priorities are.

'All these stories about billions of dollars in arms business are total
nonsense,' Mr Rabin told reporters after meeting Chinese leaders, including
President Jiang Zemin and Prime Minister Li Peng.
The Israeli leader's denials of improper transfers follow written testimony
to US Congress by Mr James Woolsey, director of the Central Intelligence
Agency, in which he said that China and Israel 'appear to be moving toward
formalising and broadening their military, technical co-operation.'
Mr Woolsey was speaking in advance of the publication of a CIA report that
alleges China has been acquiring advanced military technology from Israel
since the late 1970s. Israel's arms sales to China could amount to 'several
billion dollars,' the CIA report stated.
Apart from vigorously denying that Israel's arms trade to China amounted to
billions, Mr Rabin was also adamant that his country had not violated US
laws in the transfer of technology.
'We are not so stupid to endanger Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.96bn) in grant aid
we get for military and civilian purposes (from the US),' he told a press
conference in the Great Hall of the People.
But the CIA assessment casts doubt on how scrupulous Israel has been over
the transfer of sophisticated technology to China.
'Building on a long history of close defence industrial relations -
including work on China's next generation of fighter, air-to-air missiles,
and tank programmes - and the establishment of diplomatic relations in
January, 1992, China and Israel appear to be moving toward formalising and
broadening their military technical co-operation,' Mr Woolsey said.
The CIA chief added: 'We believe the Chinese seek from Israel advanced
military technology that US and western firms are unwilling to provide.'
Allegations about an extensive Israeli-Chinese arms connection have been
around for years. According to a Rand Corporation study commissioned by the
Pentagon in 1991, Israel has helped China to develop a surface-to-air
missile, an intermediate-range missile, an air-to-air missile, advanced
armour technology for its tanks, and an airborne early warning system, among
other items.
Mr Rabin, the first Israeli prime minister to visit China, said he hoped
Beijing would use its close ties in the Arab world to advance the peace
process. He leaves for Israel today at the end of a five-day visit in which
he has been accorded special treatment by the Chinese.

ISRAEL AND the Palestine Liberation Organisation briskly and cordially began
implementing their outline peace deal yesterday.
The two sides set a tight timetable for further detailed negotiations and
established two additional committees on economic and regional co-operation.
At separate talks in Cairo and Taba, on Egypt's Red Sea coast, the two sides
agreed on the institutional structures necessary for detailed negotiations.
They also opened continuous talks on the terms for an Israeli military
withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho, which is due to begin on
December 13.
Mr Shimon Peres, the Israeli foreign minister, wrapping up the first one-day
meeting of a joint PLO-Israeli liaison committee, said in Cairo:
'We shall make a supreme effort to meet the time (for withdrawal) and if
possible, attempt to do so earlier'.
Both Mr Peres and Mr Mahmoud Abbas, who headed the PLO delegation,
emphasised the 'positive' spirit of the talks, meeting privately before the
inaugural two-hour session of the liaison committee.
Outside, sharp-suited Israeli and Palestinian security agents milled side by
side, stonyfaced, in the corridors of the Semiramis Intercontinental Hotel.
The leaders of the two delegations were relaxed and occasionally smiling, Mr
Peres at some points translating for his counterpart.
Speaking for both, Mr Peres told reporters: 'We want to build a real
commodity, and that is goodwill.'
He added: 'Both of us have agreed that the purpose of our delegations is not
to argue and create problems, but to build bridges, the right atmosphere and
the right approach.'
Mr Abbas declared: 'We will work day and night, without being restricted by
time, to solve all the pending issues which need to be settled by the
deadline, in accordance with the agreement.'
In a communique, the two sides announced that:
The Cairo liaison committee will meet every two to three weeks at
ministerial level and may create sub-committees to address the following
problems;
The Taba negotiations on limited Israeli withdrawal will be continuous; the
two sides hope to reach agreement on withdrawal within two months;
A ministerial-level committee will be formed on economic co-operation, the
dates and venues for which are to be decided;
Further committees embracing the Palestinians, Israel and Jordan will be
formed in order to hold discussions on 'issues of common concern';
Separate talks should resume as swiftly as possible in Washington over next
year's Palestinian elections in the West Bank and Gaza.
No date has yet been set for the twelfth round of Washington peace talks,
which would also include bilateral talks between Israel, Jordan, Syria and
Lebanon.
The communique also said that the question of tens of thousands of
Palestinian prisoners held in Israel and the remaining Palestinian deportees
whom Israel despatched to south Lebanon in December last year, would be
referred to the separate talks on limited self-rule in both Gaza and
Jericho.
'The issue will be dealt with in good faith ..taking into consideration the
importance that the Palestinian side attaches to it,' the statement added.

EGYPT's President Hosni Mubarak began his third term of office yesterday by
retaining Mr Atef Sidki, his 63-year-old prime minister, who in turn
announced the first moves in a long-awaited cabinet reshuffle.
Mr Mubarak promised during his inauguration speech on Tuesday that 'new
blood' would follow his endorsement in last week's referendum for a further
six years as Egypt's head of state. He has been hinting at cabinet changes
since April and last month spoke of possible 'unlimited changes' in the
government.
However, his first move was to reappoint Mr Sidki, a man who embodies Mr
Mubarak's preference for stability and cautious reform. Mr Sidki, who
formally appoints Egypt's cabinet, then announced that Mr Mohammed Salheddin
Hamid was to be replaced as governor of the central bank by Mr Ismail
Hassan, chairman of the Bank of Alexandria.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Lu Ping, China's top official on Hong Kong, has warned that failure to
resolve differences with Britain over the colony's future would threaten its
economy.
Speaking in Beijing yesterday before receiving a delegation from Hong Kong's
Liberal party, Mr Lu said: 'If the British side sticks to (Governor) Chris
Patten's plan, it shows that Britain is not willing to co-operate with the
Chinese side to realise the smooth transfer of power.
'Under these circumstances, it is difficult to assure that Hong Kong's
economy will not be affected.'
China, which takes over Hong Kong in 1997, has been enraged by proposals
advanced by Mr Patten to broaden the franchise for elections due in 1994 and
1995.
It claims these proposals fly in the face of understandings reached with
Britain during negotiations over Hong Kong's future. Beijing has appeared in
recent days to be seeking to raise the stakes in its dispute with London.
China's chief negotiator in talks with Britain over Hong Kong warned this
week that in the absence of an agreement Beijing would simply ignore the
results of elections for local government and for Hong Kong's quasi
parliament, the Legislative Council.
Mr Jiang Enzhu, a vice foreign minister, was speaking before the 13th round
of Sino-British talks, all of which have ended inconclusively. The two sides
resume talking in Beijing next week.
Reuter adds from Hong Kong: The leader of Britain's opposition Liberal
Democratic party, Mr Paddy Ashdown, said yesterday he feared negotiations
with China on Hong Kong democratic future would collapse. But he added: 'I
am fairly confident that Hong Kong's prosperity and economy will remain
vibrant and strong right through the instability that may now be coming.'

TWO of Poland's parties with their roots in the communist past said
yesterday they intended to form a coalition government following elections
on September 19 which failed to produce an outright winner.
The Left Democratic Alliance (SLD) and the Polish Peasant Party (PSL) signed
a joint statement of their intention yesterday. Together they won 35 per
cent of the vote and control 303 seats in the 460-member parliament.
They have also proposed Mr Waldemar Pawlak, a 34-year-old farmer and PSL
leader, for prime minister.
The SLD leader, Mr Aleksander Kwasniewski, said: 'We want a government which
will support a strong market economy but which will respect social rights.'
He will not join the government but will lead the group's parliamentary
caucus.
Mr Pawlak and President Lech Walesa met for an hour yesterday evening but
issued no statement, a reflection of Mr Walesa's unhappiness with the
prospect of a left-leaning government. He is insisting that the SLD, which
won the biggest share of seats in the election, should give him three names
from which to choose a premier.
If he fails to appoint a head of government within two weeks after the first
meeting of the lower house, parliament can nominate a prime minister without
consulting him.
Yesterday, the coalition, in a conciliatory gesture to Mr Walesa, withdrew a
proposal to transfer presidential powers over the security services to the
government and parliament. This, and the coalition's refusal to accept a
reduction in Poland's mass privatisation scheme, caused the
Solidarity-rooted Labour Union to withdraw from coalition talks.
Mass privatisation, a plan backed by the World Bank, will place the
ownership of around 600 state-sector companies with foreign-managed national
investment funds and sell the shares in those funds to Poles at a nominal
charge.

MORE than 90 organisations have registered to take part in Russian elections
due on December 12, although politicians and observers expect parliament to
be dominated by a handful of blocs.
President Boris Yeltsin yesterday flatly ruled out simultaneous
parliamentary and presidential elections, as suggested by an aide on
Tuesday.
However, Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, first deputy prime minister, yesterday
repeated the opinion of many in Mr Yeltsin's entourage that elections should
be held on the same day. The president, in comments at the end of his visit
to Tokyo, did leave open the possibility of a change in presidential
elections from the announced date of June 12 next year, saying the new
parliament would decide the date.
Intense politicking is now going on between the leaders of various parties
and groups in an effort to construct election coalitions - though the
tendency at present seems towards fragmentation. The main liberal grouping,
Russia's Choice, is due to hold a convention this weekend.
Russia's Choice is headed by Mr Yegor Gaidar, first deputy prime minister,
and is likely to receive Mr Yeltsin's endorsement. However, two other
pro-market groupings - the Russian Movement for Democratic Reforms, whose
list is headed by Mr Anatoly Sobchak, mayor of St Petersburg, and the August
grouping, based on the Party of Economic Freedom headed by Mr Konstantin
Borovoi - have so far declared they will run independently.
The centre groupings are likely to include New Russia, which brings together
Christian democratic and social democratic parties.
Leaders of the communist and nationalist movements, many of whose parties
are banned under the state of emergency due to end this weekend, have said
they will participate, if necessary under the aegis of parties entitled to
run.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Pay gaps threaten to split Russia: Report warns on
consequences of widening income differences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WIDENING differences in Russian incomes could threaten both the government's
reforms and its political legitimacy, according to a report by the Centre
for Economic Policy Research.
In a paper entitled 'The Distributional Consequences of Russia's
Transition', Dr Chris Foyle points to a widening gap both between
individuals and between regions of Russia.
In being prepared, 'at least in the short term, to sacrifice equity for
efficiency', he says, the government risks sacrificing political legitimacy.
Further, the weakness of the centre and its apparent inability to impose a
fair tax structure, coupled with the growing wealth of some regions and the
deepening poverty of others, poses large political risks. 'The local versus
federal fiscal tension could result in the fragmentation of the Russian
Federation,' he believes.
A social safety net with targeted benefits is urgently required for those
who have suffered the worst effects of the rapid collapse of the command
economy, he says. Since 'the federal government is not in a strong financial
position to undertake large scale social programmes', foreign aid should
concentrate on that area.
Using the scanty data available, Dr Doyle shows that high, medium and low
earners, all of whom enjoyed significant income growth during the Gorbachev
years from 1985-1991, saw their real monthly incomes plunge by up to half in
1991-1992.
Total real household wealth had plunged from Rbs210bn at the end of 1991
(expressed in December 1990 roubles) to Rbs 29.5bn by the end of 1992, a
decline of 86 per cent. 'Thus, the impact of price liberalisation was to
severely erode household wealth.'
Pensioners have suffered particularly badly from the effects of reform. The
real purchasing power of pensions more than halved between early 1991 and
mid-1992. Those on average pensions have seen some small recovery since.
However, those on the lowest pensions remained at a very low subsistence
level to the end of last year, with their income at half or less of the
official 'physiological minimum', that is, the estimate of the monthly cost
of providing a 'healthy diet' plus an extra 20 per cent for other expenses.
Dr Doyle argues that the new tax system, heavily based on value added and
profits taxes, is as yet unstable and vulnerable to rapid erosion because of
inflation.
He says the experience of privatisation, where many assets have been sold to
citizens exchanging vouchers for shares in companies, will only initially
mean wide share ownership. In time, 'as household real incomes and wealth
have fallen sharply during the initial stages of the reform programme, it is
likely that shares and vouchers will be sold by many. . . . concentration of
ownership into a few powerful institutions (new pension funds,
conglomerates) is likely to happen'.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Danes again bail out Faroes sinking ship: Loan accord will
help stave off economic collapse for the islands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DENMARK has guaranteed a DKr1.3bn (Pounds 131m) loan to the Faroe Islands to
help the self-governing province bail out its two largest commercial banks.
The agreement came after 12 hours of negotiations in Copenhagen between Mr
Mogens Lykketoft, Danish finance minister, and Mrs Marita Petersen, Faroese
prime minister. Most of the loan will go to Foeroya Banki and
Sjovinnubankin, which faced bankruptcy.
The accord will help stave off economic collapse for the islands as a whole,
according to Mr Lykketoft. 'This step, and others to come, create a basis
for putting the Faroes on its feet again. It will take a long time and it
will be painful but it can be done,' Mr Lykketoft said yesterday.
The windswept North Atlantic islands, part of the Kingdom of Denmark, built
up large domestic and foreign debt during a period of rapid expansion in the
1980s.
Denmark stepped in earlier this year with DKr1.4bn to rescue the Faroese
banks, which had to write off 24 per cent of their loans. The Danes also
provided DKr450m to keep the government itself from having to suspend
payments.
In the mid-1980s, the 47,000 islanders enjoyed one of the highest per capita
growth rates in Europe. But little has gone right for the islands since
then.
The fisheries, which account for 90 per cent of exports, have collapsed.
Over-fishing of Faroese waters by a fishing fleet subsidised to the hilt by
the Faroese government is partly blamed. The steep fall in the international
price of fish over the past year has added to the troubles.
The decline of the fisheries industry has taken the rest of the economy with
it. In the five years to 1993, gross domestic product has fallen by about 25
per cent (in current prices) and domestic demand was halved.
Unemployment is about 20 per cent and would be higher but for the fact that
since 1988 about 4,500 islanders, some 9 per cent of the population, have
emigrated, many of them to live on social security in Denmark.
Much of the islands' debt was built up in the 1980s, when bridges, a tunnel,
schools and nurseries were built. Central and local governments alike went
heavily into debt as investment boomed and the current account of the
balance of payments went deeply into deficit.
The islands' net foreign debt soared to its present level of about DKr7.9bn.
or Dkr170,000 (some Pounds 17,000) per islander and around 140 per cent of
gross domestic product. The government's budget deficit (including capital
items), according to a report from the Danish prime minister's office, will
this year run to about DKr1.5bn, some 31 per cent of GDP.
Next year, the island government will need to borrow about DKr2.3bn, says
the report. Some DKr1bn is in foreign loans, mainly Yen and D-Marks, which
Denmark will have to refinance. How much of the rest the Danish taxpayers
will have to meet is a matter for negotiation, according to an official at
the prime minister's office.
Until fish stocks are re-established - and fish prices recover - the
islands' future looks bleak.
The government has raised taxes and slashed spending, including an 8.5 per
cent cut in the pay of everyone employed in the government sector this year.
More is needed, according to Copenhagen, which has made the loan conditional
on the Faroese government cutting spending next year by at least DKr250m.
In its report, Copenhagen proposed a a wealth tax to be levied on older
islanders, many of whom built up wealth in the good years, and a virtual
halt to infrastructure investment. In the longer run, oil and gas from
beneath the sea could be the islands' saving.
BP made a substantial find in the UK sector close to the dividing line with
the Faroese sector earlier this year. But a hunt for hydrocarbons by the
Faroese themselves is being held up by a dispute with Britain over economic
zone divisions. Even if this dispute is settled quickly, which does not seem
likely, it will be a long time before any hydrocarbons in the Faroese sector
can be exploited.
In the meantime, the islanders will have to tighten their belts and pray for
the fish return.

<TEXT>
NORWAY'S minority Labour government yesterday unveiled a draft budget
proposal for 1994 which aims to create jobs and protect the welfare state
while still cutting last year's record deficit by NKr5.1bn (Pounds 475m).
The government forecasts a budget deficit of NKr46.4bn for 1994, or 6.1 per
cent of gross domestic product, down from last year's NKr51.5bn.
However, the government said this year's budget deficit would be 3.4 per
cent of GDP, somewhat higher than the 3 per cent ceiling stipulated by the
Maastricht treaty convergence criteria. Norway is currently seeking European
Community membership.
The current account surplus is forecast to rise to NKr35.5bn from NKr25.3bn,
mainly because of higher oil production.
Total revenue is expected to increase to NKr330.2bn from NKr318.4bn last
year, while spending is set to rise to NKr376.5bn from NKr369.9bn. The
finance ministry said it aimed to raise NKr880m annually by increasing the
marginal wealth tax rate to 1.8 per cent from 1.3 per cent.
The government promised to try to cut the tax bill to industry by NKr584m in
an attempt to improve conditions for job creation. Measures to achieve this
include the abolition of an electricity duty, which the government said
would save industry NKr270m annually.
The unemployment rate is about 8 per cent, a post war record.
Economic growth is forecast to accelerate to 3 per cent from 1.3 per cent
this year.

IG CHEMIE, the German chemicals industry union, will make a pay claim of
'around' 4.2 per cent at negotiations for 1994 starting next month,
according to Mr Hermann Rappe, union president.
Mr Rappe, who represents 819,000 workers across German industry, said in a
radio interview the union would resist calls for a pay freeze.
His informal 'estimate' of a claim yet to be agreed by the union's board
highlights the low morale among workers' representatives as they prepare for
the new year's pay round.
The chemicals industry employers have made no proposals, although they have
been at pains to illustrate their lack of ability to pay.
Their association recently said 30,000 jobs would go this year and more
would follow in 1994. Pay had risen 15.5 per cent in the past three years
while productivity had gone up only 6 per cent.
Mr Rappe claimed 4.2 per cent would match the expected rate of inflation in
western Germany next year, although all official and unofficial forecasters
predict a rate of 3.5 per cent.
His proposal followed Tuesday's recommendation from IG Metall, representing
engineers and metal workers, for a rise of 'up to 6 per cent', which was
immediately rejected by employers as 'poison'.
In Bonn, Mr Dieter Kirchner, chief executive of Gesamtmetall, the
engineering employers' federation, described the union's claim as
'incomprehensible, unrealistic and illusory'.
He warned that Gesamtmetall and IG Metall, the two giants of the German wage
bargaining process, were in danger of becoming extinct if they failed to
find realistic solutions to the high-cost problems of the industry.
'If we follow the old pattern of negotiations, there will be a loss of
confidence in the wage bargainers,' he said. 'We don't want to be one of the
dinosaurs. I do not think IG Metall wants to be one either.
'What we need this year is a significant cost reduction. This combination of
a six per cent wage demand, and a call for a moratorium on job cuts is
simply impossible to understand.'

FT  14 OCT 93 / Aer Lingus faces state aid probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday started a state aid inquiry into the Irish
government's planned IPounds 175m (Pounds 166m) cash injection into Aer
Lingus, Ireland's flag airline.
The decision to query the package marks a hardening line in Brussels against
attempts by member states to bail out their financially troubled carriers,
and to chip away at the air transport deregulation legislation agreed last
year. Mr Abel Matutes, EC transport commissioner, signalled last month that
he was not satisfied with the cost-cutting measures Aer Lingus was taking as
part of the three-year restructuring plan the state aid is linked to.
The Commission is seeking 'more information in four main areas:
The airline's plans for its ground-handling monopoly; Brussels is separately
investigating refuelling and baggage-handling monopolies at airports across
Europe.
The extent to which Aer Lingus' obligation to stop over at Shannon airport
on transatlantic flights is a cost impeding a return to viability.
The competition implications of the state aid on the Dublin-London route.
A commitment from Ireland that this will be the last state aid to the
airline.
Aer Lingus and Dublin have a month to reply to these queries before Brussels
decides either to approve the aid or take the enquiry a stage further.
During that period it may also start examining other aviation state aid
cases involving plans to put more cash into Air France, Olympic Airways of
Greece, and TAP, Portugal's flag carrier.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPANISH inflation fell last month to its lowest year-on-year September level
since 1987, fuelling market expectations of interest rate cuts soon.
The pressure on the monetary authorities to help kick-start the economy with
lower rates has built up since figures released at the beginning of the week
showed that the number of new unemployed between January and September had
risen by 336,770.
A total of 2.5m Spaniards, or 16.6 per cent of the active working
population, are now registered as seeking jobs.
Prices rose by 0.6 per cent last month to bring accumulated inflation for
the first nine months of the year to 3.9 per cent. Year-on-year headline
inflation is now down from 4.6 per cent at the end of August to 4.3 per cent
at the end of last month. Underlying inflation, which excludes the more
volatile prices of non-processed foods and energy, fell from an annual rate
of 5.7 per cent to 5.4 per cent. There has been a significant slowdown in
price rises in the services sector, which is now feeling the impact of
recession.
Analysts said that although annualised inflation is expected to rise
slightly in the next three months to stand above 4.5 per cent at the end of
the year, there was now room for the Bank of Spain to follow up on a
half-point interest cut it introduced at the begining of September when it
brought its key intervention rate down to 10 per cent. Since the last rate
cut, the government has unveiled a restrictive 1994 budget that reduces
expenditure and has an inflation rate target for the end of next year of 3.5
per cent.

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE is entering a 'test phase' for monetary union, when individual
central banks have it within their power to create a solid basis for it, the
president of the Bundesbank said yesterday.
Countries now had to prove the credibility of their national monetary
policy, rather than engage in disputes over the framework of European
monetary union (Emu) as set down in the Maastricht treaty, Mr Hans Tietmeyer
told the VWD news agency.
This would be the only way that monetary union had a chance of being
successfully implemented in practice, Mr Tietmeyer cautioned. Countries
would have to show a firm commitment to monetary stability in the years
ahead and implement the institutional changes necessary to give national
central banks the necessary independence.
It was also important for public opinion to develop a 'stability culture',
he said. Mr Tietmeyer was giving his reaction to the German Constitutional
Court's ruling on Tuesday that Germany's ratification of the Maastricht
treaty was valid.
The second stage of monetary union is due to to start on January 1 next year
when the European Monetary Institute (EMI) will start operations. Mr
Tietmeyer said its role would be to strengthen co-operation between EC
central banks and to co-ordinate the monetary policy of member nations with
a view to price stability.
But responsibility for monetary policy will remain with national central
banks during the second stage of monetary union, and all important decisions
on the EMS will continue to be taken unanimously, he said. Mr Tietmeyer
reiterated his call for the EMI to be located in Frankfurt.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Belgian franc yesterday dropped to its lowest level against the D-Mark
for at least three years amid renewed speculation about a possible cut in
interest rates.
In spite of support from the Belgian central bank, which denied rumours of a
change in interest rate policy, the Belgian currency slipped at one point to
the bottom of the European exchange rate mechanism. The French franc was
also pushed down sharply.
Belgian analysts said there seemed to be no single reason why the Belgian
franc should have come under such pressure yesterday. However, tension has
been mounting in recent weeks, as the government prepares to publish
guidelines for its negotiations with employers and unions over a 'social
pact' to lay the foundations for deficit reduction, cuts in labour costs and
improved competitiveness.
Certain Belgian economists have suggested that easing interest rates might
be one way of making Belgian companies more competitive.
Dealers said that pressure on the franc had come from within but there were
also rumours that it might have been generated by Mr George Soros's Quantum
Fund, the US investment group which made some Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) at
the time of sterling's exit from the ERM last year.
The Belgian franc ended the day at BFr21.89 against the D-Mark, up slightly
from a low of BFr21.95 but weaker than its previous close of BFr21.78.

Europe could face the prospect of 30m people out of work by the end of the
century unless it adjusts its post-war model of the social market economy,
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, warned yesterday,
writes Lionel Barber in Brussels. His statement came in a speech to the
European parliament.
But he expressed confidence that Europe could remain competitive with the US
and Asia and resume steady growth by exploiting its greatest resource: human
capital.
Speaking one day after the German constitutional court ruled favourably on
Maastricht, he said the new treaty would allow the EC to 'shift gear'. But
he warned that EC governments must tackle mass unemployment and faltering
competitiveness.

Germany's leading political parties have all lost substantial support in the
opinion polls over the past two months, with a significant rise in the
popularity of all the fringe protest groups, writes Quentin Peel. The
Christian Democratic Union, and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian
Social Union, would get only 30.9 per cent support if there were an election
this week, according to the latest poll by the Allensbach Institute. At the
last general election in December, 1990, the parties won 43.8 per cent. The
Social Democrats are down to 35.4 per cent, compared with 38.2 per cent in
the west and 34.8 per cent in the east. The principal beneficiaries have
been the Greens, up to 12.1 per cent, and the far right Republicans, up to
5.6 per cent, enough to gain them seats in the Bundestag.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Horst Kohler, the newly-appointed president of the German Savings Bank
Association, yesterday stepped into the growing debate on bank privatisation
by calling for his member banks to remain in public ownership.
Mr Kohler said that privatisation of Germany's 710 local authority-owned
savings banks and 13 commercial banks owned by state governments could lead
to restrictions on lending to small and medium-sized companies.
His remarks at a press conference follow pressure from German politicians
including Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the federal economics minister, for the
speeding-up of bank privatisation. Mr Kohler, formerly finance ministry
state secretary, said that the 13 Landesbanken and 710 Sparkassen which
account for 60 per cent of all small business lending, could lose their
regional strength if privatised.
He said that public ownership enabled the savings banks to take a
longer-term view of finance for small and medium-sized businesses, and their
network of 20,000 branches led to more accurate credit assessments. Mr
Kohler said that it was important to ensure that financial services were
available in all regions. He said privatisation of savings banks could lead
to 'more concentration, and more fragility in our economy'.
He said that savings banks were supporting local businesses more strongly
than privately-owned commercial banks, since Sparkassen lending was 6 per
cent up in the first half of the year, compared with the second half of
1992. Mr Rexrodt last month promised new laws to accelerate privatisation of
the Sparkassen and Landesbanken. He singled out WestLB, the Landesbank in
North Rhine-Westphalia for criticism over its equity stakes in companies.
Mr Otto Lambsdorff, economics spokesman and former leader of the Free
Democrats, Mr Rexrodt's own party, has also called for bank privatisation,
which economists have calculated could raise DM100bn-DM150bn (Pounds
40bn-Pounds 60bn) for the government.
Mr Kohler said the Sparkassen had to reduce costs and improve their use of
technology, but their relatively low proportion of write-offs of assets,
including loans, showed that their local presence improved earnings.

THE Belgian franc yesterday dropped to its lowest level against the D-Mark
for at least three years amid renewed speculation about a possible cut in
interest rates.
In spite of support from the Belgian central bank, which denied rumours of a
change in interest rate policy, the Belgian currency slipped at one point to

Belgian analysts said there seemed to be no single reason why the Belgian

been mounting in recent weeks, as the government prepares to publish
guidelines for its negotiations with employers and unions over a 'social

The guidelines have been prepared by a committee headed by Mr Alfons
Verplaese, the central bank governor, and are expected to lay the foundation
for cuts in labour costs, improvements in competitiveness, and the reduction
of Belgium's large budget deficit.
Certain Belgian economists have suggested that easing interest rates might
be one way of making Belgian companies more competitive.
Dealers said yesterday that pressure on the franc had come from within
Belgium but there were also rumours that it might have been generated by Mr
George Soros's Quantum Fund, the US investment group which made also Dollars
1bn (Pounds 600m) at the time of sterling's exit from the ERM last year. The
Belgian franc ended the day at BFr21.89 against the D-Mark, up slightly from
a low of BFr21.95 but weaker than its previous close of BFr21.78.
The fall reflected the view that the 'core' members of the ERM, saddled with
high unemployment and hit by recession, may have to ease interest rates
shortly, in spite of pledges to shadow the D-Mark.
The French franc closed at FFr3.5290 against the D-Mark, down from
FFr3.5120. A spate of strikes, lower overnight interest rates and comments
from Mr Edmond Alhpandery, the minister for the economy, that a weaker franc
had been a key factor for stimulating growth, gave hope that the key
intervention rate might fall from its present 6.8 per cent.

FT  14 OCT 93 / US investors set to take big stake in Lloyd's agency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of US financial institutions is poised to acquire a substantial
stake in the Merrett underwriting agency in a significant innovation for the
Lloyd's insurance market.
The Merrett group said yesterday it had approached Lloyd's with an outline
plan to transfer its underwriting business to a new agency, in which JP
Morgan, the investment bank, Marsh &amp; McLennan Risk Capital, a subsidiary of
Marsh &amp; McLennan, the world's biggest insurance broker, Merrett employees
and an unnamed US insurance company would own stakes.
It is envisaged that the agency would underwrite business for a subsidiary
of the same US insurance company, which would operate alongside Merrett's
insurance syndicates on a so-called 'consortium' basis.
Together, the insurance company and the syndicates would aim to maintain
Merrett's insurance business at its existing levels.
The move follows a sharp contraction in the capital base of the Merrett
syndicates after the desertion this year of many Names, the individuals
whose assets traditionally support Lloyd's.
Mr Stephen Merrett, chairman of the Merrett group, has reduced his role in
the agency after pressure from Names, and resigned as deputy chairman of
Lloyd's last month.
Mr Stephen Cane, managing director of the Merrett Group, said the new
investors would 'probably' have a majority of the new agency. He insisted
that the Merrett Group did not want to leave Lloyd's, but conceded that
'this is a significant departure for a typical Lloyd's underwriting
operation'.
The insurance company is a 'substantial and significant' US group. It could
provide about a quarter of the Merrett agencies' capacity next year, Mr Cane
said. More than three quarters of the business underwritten by Merrett
syndicates comes from the US.
Lloyd's said yesterday that it was 'considering proposals carefully. In so
far as they require consent and approval from Lloyd's we shall be
approaching consideration of these (matters) from the standpoint of the
interests of Names on Merrett syndicates, whose interests are also
recognised by the Merrett Group'.
Although overseas interests have never before held control of a Lloyd's
managing agency, it is understood that there is nothing in the regulatory
framework to prohibit such a move.
Marsh and Morgan agreed this year to form a new Bermuda-based company to
reinsure business accepted by the Merrett syndicates. But the sudden decline
in the fortunes of the Merrett Group this year had jeopardised the success
of that plan.
The group hopes to conclude talks on the new arrangements by the end of the
month.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Recovery hopes dealt double blow: Inflation rate rises by
more than forecast and manufacturing output declines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES of sustained, non-inflationary recovery in Britain were dealt a double
blow yesterday with news of a fall in manufacturing output over the summer
and a higher-than-expected rise in retail prices last month.
Manufacturing output fell by a seasonally adjusted 0.4 per cent in August,
confounding City expectations of a 0.4 per cent rise in the month, while the
annual rate of retail price inflation quickened for the third successive
month to 1.8 per cent in September, up sharply from June's 1.2 per cent low.
More worrying for Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, who meets his ministers
and senior Treasury officials tomorrow to discuss his first Budget on
November 30, was September's rise to 3.3 per cent in underlying inflation,
excluding mortgage interest payments, from 3.1 per cent in the year to
August.
Central Statistical Office figures also showed that growth in industrial
production faltered during the summer with manufacturing output down 0.7 per
cent in the three months to August 31 compared with the previous three-month
period.
A confidential Treasury briefing paper leaked by the Labour party last night
said manufacturing output would have to grow by about 2 per cent in
September to meet expectations of manufacturing output growth of about  1/2
per cent a month in August and September.
Yesterday's figures, following closely on Monday's news of a widening UK
trade deficit and rising producer price inflation, underlined the fragility
of the UK recovery and pointed to a narrowing of Mr Clarke's room for
manoeuvre in the Budget.
Weak output might undermine any plans for a tax rise to cut Britain's Pounds
50bn annual budget deficit.
The increase in underlying inflation to within the top quarter of the
government's 1 to 4 per cent target range may limit his scope for a rise in
indirect taxes such as value added tax and affect his ability to cut
interest rates to offset fiscal tightening.
Those conflicting currents were reflected in financial markets yesterday.
Gilts and sterling fell sharply on the two reports, reflecting fears of
higher inflation and concern about the recovery. They later made up some
ground: 10-year gilt-edged stock closed  3/16 points down, while sterling at
the London close was  1/4 pfennig lower at DM2.4425. In late New York
trading, the pound slipped to DM2.4390.
Equities weakened with the FT-SE 100 index down 23.5 points by early
afternoon. But share prices later recovered as investors reasoned that the
chancellor would now be less likely to raise taxes. The FT-SE 100 index
closed at 3,080.9, down 13.8 points.
City analysts said the figures were disappointing, but the Treasury and the
Bank of England said the recovery was still on track. The Bank said it
expected inflation to remain in its target range and recalled that the rise
in underlying inflation had been forecast in its August report.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said Britain was
still heading for 3 per cent growth in mid 1994 and denied the recovery was
dying. 'We never said this would proceed in a straight line,' Mr Dorrell
said.
Because state pensions and benefits are upgraded according to September
retail price inflation, next April's rise in pensions and benefits will be
the smallest since the early 1960s.
Mr Donald Dewar, the shadow social security secretary, said pensioners on
the basic retirement pension would get just Pounds 1 a week from the
upgrading, while their fuel bills would 'also go up by around Pounds 1 a
week as a result of 8 per cent VAT on domestic fuel'.
The increase in headline and underlying inflation reflected widespread price
rises for retail goods, including dearer petrol and secondhand cars.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Planned Inmarsat flotation would create company worth over
Dollars 2bn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
INMARSAT, the international satellite operator owned by 71 of the world's
telecommunications authorities and companies, will in effect be floated next
year under a plan put forward by the company. The move would create a
company likely to be worth more than Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn).
The biggest shareholder is Comsat, the publicly quoted US company, with 24.6
per cent. British Telecom comes next with 11.7 per cent, followed by
Norwegian Telecom with 10.7 per cent and Japan's KDD with 9.1 per cent.
Inmarsat was established in 1979 to provide satellite communications for
shipping. It has since expanded into land and air mobile communications and
is now used for telephones and faxes in passenger aircraft and by
newsgathering and emergency services.
The organisation's annual turnover exceeds Dollars 300m and it has a
'surplus', equivalent to a profit, of about Dollars 100m a year.
Its annual growth has exceeded 20 per cent for the last four years.
The mechanism likely to be put to Inmarsat's owners early next year is that
their stakes become tradeable with each other. From there it is a relatively
small step to allowing third parties to buy stakes in Inmarsat.
If Inmarsat were to be valued on a similar basis to companies such as BT or
Cable and Wireless, it would be worth more than Dollars 2bn.
On a valuation of Dollars 2bn, BT's stake in Inmarsat would be worth Dollars
236m, compared with its net investment so far of Dollars 35m.
Inmarsat has in recent months laid plans to move into mass markets for
mobile communications.
It wants to build a global mobile telecommunications network based on its
satellites.
But the scheme is bringing it into conflict with private sector companies
such as Motorola.
'We're operating in an increasingly competitive environment. It is useful to
have an accurate value of shareholders' investment,' said Mr Ramin Khadem,
Inmarsat's chief financial officer.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Bell Atlantic buys cable TV company for Dollars 22bn
</HEADLINE>

BELL ATLANTIC, the US regional telephone group, announced an agreement
yesterday to buy Tele-Communications Inc, the largest American cable
television company, for up to about Dollars 22bn (Pounds 14bn) in a deal
that will radically change the US communication industry. It will also be
one of the country's biggest takeovers.
The deal would be the first full merger between a US telephone company and a
cable business while the two industries are converging to create a single,
multi-media inter-active entertainment and information business.
Bell Atlantic, the Baby Bell telecommunications group serving part of the US
eastern seaboard, has been one of the most aggressive telephone companies
trying to enter the video industry.
TCI, based in Denver, has been built up by Mr John Malone, its chief
executive, over the past 20 years into a company serving one in five cable
homes.
The share swap deal would also include Liberty Media, a cable programming
company that TCI spun off in 1991. It announced plans to re-acquire the
business last Friday.
Yesterday's pact may have implications for the takeover battle for
entertainment group Paramount Communications. Liberty Media is an important
shareholder in QVC Network, the home shopping channel headed by Mr Barry
Diller, which is making a hostile Dollars 9.5bn bid for Paramount, in
competition with a Dollars 7.5bn agreed bid from cable company Viacom.
Analysts said the Bell Atlantic deal may help strengthen QVC's position. Mr
Malone said yesterday that the QVC bid was peripheral to the Bell Atlantic
deal.
Viacom, which has launched a legal suit trying to block the QVC bid because
of Mr Malone's alleged 'monopolistic intentions' called on Congress to 'take
a hard look' at Mr Malone's record.
The Bell Atlantic deal will face close regulatory scrutiny. Ms Janet Reno,
the US attorney general, said last night that the Justice Department and the
House of Representatives telecommunications subcommittee would look into the
acquisition.
Under the 1984 cable act, regional telecommunications companies are
forbidden to buy cable companies where they operate telephone services. To
get round that, TCI's cable service operations in the Bell Atlantic region
would be spun off.
In addition, Bell Atlantic's acquisition of TCI and Liberty's cable
programming assets have to be cleared by the court that oversaw the creation
of the Baby Bell companies in 1984, when American Telephone and Telegraph
was split up.
Wall Street welcomed the deal, with Bell Atlantic's stock closing at Dollars
65 7/8 , up Dollars 5 7/8 , while TCI's A shares rose Dollars 3 to Dollars
31 3/8 and other cable stocks rallied on expectations of a spate of bids.

England's chances of reaching next year's soccer World Cup finals suffered a
severe setback when they were beaten 2-0 by Holland in Rotterdam. The match
took place in the wake of further violence in which about 400 people, mostly
England fans, were arrested. Later around 200 escaped from an army detention
barracks.
England may yet qualify if they beat San Marino in their last match and
Holland lose to Poland. Wales, 2-0 winners over Cyprus, and the Republic of
Ireland, beaten 3-1 by Spain, can still qualify. Northern Ireland, who lost
1-0 to Denmark, and Scotland, 3-1 losers in Italy, now cannot.

FT  14 OCT 93 / Radio station chairman produces pirate decoders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHAIRMAN of a Birmingham commercial radio station has built up a
multi-million pound business making and supplying pirate decoder cards for a
wide range of subscription satellite channels in Europe.
Mr Chris Cary, a former pirate radio broadcaster on Radio Caroline, runs an
electronics company in Camberley, Surrey, which is offering unauthorised
decoders for channels using the EuroCrypt security system.
The channels include Scandinavian channels TV 1000 and the three channels of
TV3 plus Filmnet, the English-language film subscription broadcast to the
Low Countries, and Filmmax, another film subscription channel. Hard core
pornography is available late at night on some of the Scandinavian channels.
Supplying decoder cards for TV 1000 and the TV3 channels, based in the UK,
is almost certainly a criminal offence in the UK.
Mr Cary said yesterday he was selling Buzz FM, his Birmingham-based radio
station, in a Pounds 500,000 deal.

FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (11): Gains made despite recession - The
long-term role of the sector is assured, with Asian and eastern European
markets offering huge potential / The drinks industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DRINKS industry achieved a further increase in exports last year in
spite of recession in many of its most important markets.
Although Guinness dropped two places to 12th in the Top 100, the group
recorded close to a 15 per cent rise in export sales to Pounds 975m.
Allied-Lyons moved down three places from 27th to 30th but recorded a 12 per
cent increase to Pounds 402m; Grand Metropolitan also fell from 36th spot to
40th but raised overseas sales by 6.6 per cent to Pounds 308m. Seagram
slipped one place to 44th.
Bass, the brewing and hotels group, remains outside the Top 100 but managed
to increase its sales by 12 per cent to Pounds 73m. Its success is based on
an increasing thirst for Bass ale in the US and Spain, and Tennent's lager
in Italy.
Scotch whisky was the mainstay of the international spirits groups'
performance. While sales of Scotch fell by almost 10 per cent in the UK, the
value of exports rose for the ninth successive year to Pounds 1.96bn.
Overseas markets now account for nearly 86 per cent of the industry's sales.
Overall world demand for spirits, however, fell slightly during the year. In
general, the marketing and distribution strengths of the leading UK-based
groups have enabled them in recent years to offset a slow decline in
domestic demand and in mature markets such as the US and Canada, with growth
in continental Europe, Asia/Pacific, and Latin America.
This proved more difficult to achieve as 1992 wore on. While conditions in
the US - and particularly California - remained depressed, recession began
to bite in other important markets. The most serious blow to the spirits
exporters came from the deteriorating economic conditions in Japan, one of
the biggest high-value growth markets of the late 1980s.
Growing unemployment and waning consumer confidence were quickly reflected
in the demand for imported spirits. The squeeze was felt most severely in
the high-priced bar trade and gift-giving sectors, which accounted for 30
per cent of volumes and a higher proportion of value sales. Elsewhere in
East Asia, Taiwan remained healthy but Thailand, another de-luxe market, and
Korea weakened.
In Europe, the German market began to decline as the euphoria of unification
gave way to recessionary forces. Demand also slackened in Italy and France,
but improved in Scandinavia with a reduction in excise duties and more
liberal regulation. More affluent young consumers sustained relatively
buoyant markets in Spain, Greece and Portugal.
Latin America, which accounts for 11 per cent of Scotch whisky export
volumes, showed greater volatility. There were huge increases in consumption
in some countries. Sales to Argentina were 70 per cent higher; consumption
of mainly de-luxe whisky brands in Venezuela, the region's largest market,
were 43 per cent ahead. But economic difficulties in Brazil caused a 32 per
cent fall in shipments.
Under the impact of worsening economic conditions, consumers in several
markets began to trade down to lower-priced spirits brands. Exporters of
Scotch, in particular, found this pressure on prices compounded by
over-production and surplus stocks. The worldwide trend towards lower
inflation rates also restrained the 'confident pricing' policies that had
ruled throughout the late 1980s.
Patchy trading conditions have persisted this year and will hold back export
growth. Anthony Greener, Guinness chairman and chief executive, reported:
'We are still seeing signs of further deterioration in some major markets
and any overall recovery remains elusive.'
While economic conditions in some countries, such as the US and Australia,
appear to be improving, other markets, such as Spain and Germany, are being
increasingly affected by declining consumer confidence. In the first six
months of the year, Guinness increased volume sales but found the gains
concentrated in the lower-priced segments of the market. The group has been
able to achieve only modest price increases for its brands, reflecting lower
inflation and a highly competitive environment.
However, the longer term role of the drinks groups among the UK's leading
exporters seems assured. International quality spirits' share of the overall
world market is just 7 per cent - and everywhere they continue to gain at
the expense of local products.
Trade barriers which have protected some of the biggest markets are
crumbling. China, India, and eastern Europe offer huge potential. Whatever
the doubts in the US and UK about the value of brands, vast numbers of
consumers in the emergent markets aspire to drink Johnnie Walker, J &amp; B, and
Ballantine's Scotch.
Guinness says:'The world market for whisky of all kinds is around 200m
cases. Scotch, the most authentic whisky, only accounts for 72m cases, or 36
per cent. In Asia alone, from India to Japan, 80m cases of whisky are
consumed every year of which only 5 per cent is Scotch. Even if we only
convert 1 per cent of whisky drinkers every year, think what that can do for
the sales of the major premium brands.'

FT  13 OCT 93 / International Company News: Polish investors buy cement
plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND is to sell one of the country's most modern cement works, in Ozarow,
to a group of domestic investors led by the Polish Development Bank (PBR),
Mr Janusz Lewandowski, the outgoing privatisation minister, announced
yesterday.
The decision comes in a letter of intent signed yesterday with the
state-owned PBR as well as management and unions at the plant.
It follows the sale in July of stakes in two Polish plants, which account
for a quarter of Poland's cement output, to Cimenteries CBR of Belgium for
DM90.4m (Dollars 56.5m).
CBR has since sold a 43 per cent share of its equity to Heidelberger Zement,
Germany's largest producer of building materials.
The Ozarow plant has a 15 per cent share of the market and expects to report
a 100bn zlotys (Dollars 5m) net profit on sales of 850bn zlotys, which
represents a 30 per cent increase on 1992 sales. It was completed in 1977,
along with Gorazdze, one of the two plants sold to CBR.
'I think this decision should be in line with the next coalition's
thinking,' said Mr Lewandowski of the way the new left-of-centre government,
which is expected to be formed following last month's elections, would view
the letter of intent on Ozarow.
He criticised the Belgian group for not informing him that it was on the
verge of the sale to the German group as negotiations of their purchases in
Poland were proceeding.
He also said that the International Finance Corporation, a World Bank
affiliate which is advising the ministry on the privatisation of the cement
sector, had failed to warn him of the impending change in ownership at CBR.
'If I had known I would have re-evaluated my decision,' Mr Lewandowski said.
He added that at least 25 per cent of the remaining shares in Gorazdze would
be be sold to the Polish group, which is made up of banks, private companies
and management.
This would see the creation of a base for a Polish capital group in the
cement industry.

FT  13 OCT 93 / International Company News: Le Comptoir falls into the red

LE COMPTOIR des Entrepreneurs, the troubled French financial group,
yesterday confirmed that it fell into the red in the first half of this year
with a net consolidated loss of FFr940.5m (Dollars 167m) against net profits
of FFr23.7m in the same period of last year.
The company, which has been badly affected by the problems of the French
commercial property market, is in the final stages of being rescued by its
shareholders in a restructuring package orchestrated by the Bank of France
and the economy ministry.
Le Comptoir, which went into deficit last year with a net loss of FFr1.05bn,
was forced in February to turn to the French authorities for help after it
hit serious liquidity problems.
The company said the rescue package was 'progressing' but it could not give
any indication of its likely performance for the full financial year. Mr
Francis Lemasson, chairman, recently stated that he did not expect Le
Comptoir to break even until 1995.
Group turnover fell sharply in the first half to FFr3bn, against FFr4.8bn in
the interim period of 1992. Le Comptoir attributed the decline in activity
to the continuing pressures on the property market and its own financial
difficulties. It was forced to make provisions of FFr1.31bn in the first
half.
Assurances Generales de France (AGF), the state-controlled insurance company
which is the largest shareholder in Le Comptoir, last week cited the losses
on its 30 per cent stake as one of the main reasons for its static
first-half profits.

<TEXT>
GIROBANK, the state-owned bank, has confirmed that 51 per cent of its shares
are to be sold through an issue to the public before the end of the year.
Terms were not disclosed.
The flotation will be the first important privatisation sale in Denmark for
several years. A minority stake in TeleDanmark, the monopoly
telecommunications group, will be sold within the next year.
Girobank was formed in 1991 from the post office giro operation. It ranks as
the country's fifth-largest bank with assets at the end of last year of
DKr44.7bn (Dollars 6.9bn).
The shares to be issued will have a face value of DKr255m.
At the average ratio of share prices to net asset value for banks listed in
Copenhagen, an issue of DKr255m would yield about DKr800m.
As a consequence of its past as the post office giro payments operation, the
bank is heavily biased towards transactions business.
It has one main advantage over the commercial banks, in that it does not
have the large portfolio of bad loans which have troubled the commercial
banks over the past two years.
Girobank made a pre-tax profit of DKr75m in 1992, making it one of the few
banks to be in the black.
Its provisions were a modest DKr47m.
The four big banks, by contrast, all reported hefty losses, varying from
DKr919m at Jyske Bank to DKr4.6bn at Unidanmark, with loss provisions
varying from DKr1.2bn to DKr6.2bn.

<TEXT>
MS Benazir Bhutto's chances of forming a government in Pakistan have
strengthened after an apparent decision by Mr Nawaz Sharif, her arch rival,
to abandon his attempt to seek office.
Instead, Mr Sharif has intensified his efforts to form the government in the
Punjab, Pakistan's largest and wealthiest province, which is widely regarded
to be crucial for the smooth functioning of the central government.
Concentrating on the Punjab, which is Mr Sharif's home province, would
strengthen the position of his Pakistan Moslem League (PML) party. Punjab is
also crucial for the success of the future government. Mr Sharif took office
as the chief minister of the province in 1988 when Ms Bhutto became the
prime minister. However, he was able to force the dismissal of her
government 20 months later, partly because of intense conflict between the
centre and the Punjab.
The PML won 106 seats in Saturday's provincial elections, against the 112 by
the PPP and its allies. Both sides are now trying to win the support of
independent members and representatives of non-Moslem minorities to gain a
majority in the 248-seat house.
Despite Mr Sharif's latest efforts, Ms Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party
claimed last night that it continued to have the largest number of seats in
both the centre and the Punjab, and could form both governments.

FT  13 OCT 93 / TV politicians vie with sumo and starlets: The sprouting of
new parties has meant a bonanza for Japan's producers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN between reports of a cocaine smuggling scandal and the latest gossip on a
starlet's divorce, Japanese television's Morning Eye now covers policy
speeches by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the country's new prime minister.
'You can't leave out politics these days,' says Mr Katsuyuki Ishimori of
Tokyo Broadcasting System, the network that airs the programme.
Political coverage in Japan has traditionally been dominated by the daily
newspapers, which kept important disclosures and information to themselves,
to maintain cozy relationships with politicians. Instead, TV stories focused
on squabbles between factions within the LDP.
But the downfall of the LDP and the sprouting of new parties have created an
extravaganza for TV producers and their viewers. 'Politics is easier to
understand these days. In a way, it has become a show,' says Asahi
Television, one of the nationwide networks.
It is not just that television has discovered politicians, the politicians
have discovered television. Members of the coalition government are putting
it to full use in their efforts to present a different image from their
predecessors in the Liberal Democratic Party, which held power for 38 years.
In an unprecedented move, Mr Hosokawa gave his press conference with Mr John
Major, UK prime minister, in the lush green garden of his residence in
central Tokyo last month.
Instead of sitting in front of a desk, the two premiers stood in front of
podiums, while Mr Hosokawa pointed to reporters with his pen in the 'Bill
Clinton' way.
Television also played a leading part in politicking, following dissolution
of the parliament in July. Camera crews eagerly followed the members of the
new groups splintering from the LDP.
Mr Susmu Yanase, of the New Harbinger Party, was nicknamed 'Crybaby Yanase'
after he was filmed leaving the LDP headquarters in tears.
Politicians of all camps aired their views and sometimes argued with each
other, in public, a stark change from traditional political negotiations
held behind the scenes in expensive Japanese tatami-mat restaurants or
smoke-filled hotel rooms.
But the excessive campaign coverage ahead of the lower-house elections in
July has been blamed for low voter turnout on election day.
'People closely watching politics on television already felt they had
participated,' one media analyst says. At the same time, the programmes
decided the fate of some of the candidates.
Ms Makiko Tanaka, the daughter of Mr Kakuei Tanaka, a former prime minister
who fell from grace due to his involvement in a scandal in the 1970s, has
been a fierce critic of the media.
However, her recent election as an MP followed a campaign which was covered
extensively on television, and she has since become an advocate of TV
coverage of politics.
Leading politicians have also begun to use television to float policies.
Reporters now sit in front of their TV screens awaiting important comments,
and it is quite common for provocative statements on political talk-shows to
make the headlines in the daily newspapers.
One of the more controversial television appearances was by Mr Masayoshi
Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, who recently expressed support for
electoral reform plans during a talk show, which were opposed by the two
leading coalition parties. His comments prompted strong criticism from
within the coalition, forcing Mr Takemura to apologise to party leaders.
The television networks are owned by leading national newspapers with a wide
range of political views, from the vaguely leftist Asahi to the more
conservative Yomiuri.
But to appeal to a wide range of viewers, political bias, where it has
appeared, has been limited to labelling the new reformist parties 'good' and
the old LDP 'bad'.
This, say some critics, is one of the dangers of political coverage by
television. Mr Akira Aoki, professor of communications at the Tokyo
University of Information Sciences, says that while television has made
politics more digestible for the ordinary viewer, it has also tended to
over-simplify issues.
'Things aren't that simple, but television isn't able to give in-depth
explanation to its viewers.' he contends.
Once the political scene becomes stable (and dull), it could lose its place
in morning variety shows.
However, with frictions within the coalition government starting to appear,
and some younger members of the LDP threatening to quit the main party,
politicians may go on holding their place in television along with the sumo
wrestlers and the film stars.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Tehran's vendetta hits the Kurds hard: The war with the
guerrillas is worsening, writes Gareth Smyth, recently in Baneh region,
western Iran
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARETH SMYTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASHAD Rashidi is 23, newly married and frightened. A shell recently exploded
across the isolated, rocky valley in western Iran where he and his five
brothers farm. The boom of artillery fire echoes almost daily around the
area. 'I know of more than 20 people who have been killed,' he says.
Within the mud-baked walls of his house hang pictures of President Hashemi
Rafsanjani as well as Ayatollah Khameini, Iran's spiritual leader, and the
late Ayatollah Khomeini. 'When the pasdaran (revolutionary guards) see these
pictures, they will not harm us,' Mr Rashidi explains.
The shelling is one sign of the intensifying conflict between Tehran's
Islamic regime and the peshmerga guerrillas of the Kurdistan Democratic
party of Iran (KDPI). Yet a news blackout operated by Iran ensures the
trouble goes largely unreported in the outside world.
It is a bitter, large-scale conflict. Iran is said to have stationed around
200,000 troops, mainly pasdaran, in its Kurdish region since Ayatollah
Khomenei declared a jihad (holy war) against the mainly Sunni Kurds in 1980.
The peshmerga claim the pasdaran have lost the will to fight. 'They used to
hang pictures of the Ayatollah on their chests and wear headbands as a
symbol of (the seventh century Shia martyr) Hussein, but only a few do that
now,' said Mr Sa'ed Brayhim, KDPI commander for the Baneh region.
Rather than engage in hand-to-hand fighting, the pasdaran, who have bases in
all the local towns and many villages, resort to the imprecise use of
artillery and mortars against peshmerga who move largely at night and
receive food and moral support from Kurdish villagers.
The hamlet of Bagy Kazy, some 20 miles south-west of Baneh, was abandoned by
residents terrified of shelling, KDPI peshmerga claim. Recent signs of
habitation (hay in cattle pens, abandoned pots) were testimony to the
villagers' rapid departure.
In escalating its campaign, the KDPI draws strength from bases across the
border in northern Iraq made possible since the emergence in late 1991 on
Iraqi soil of a 'free Kurdistan' with de facto independence from Baghdad.
The government of 3m Iraqi Kurds, who elected their own unofficial
'parliament' last year, has fanned the nationalist aspirations of the
estimated 5m-8m Iranian Kurds denied any autonomy and compelled to use the
Farsi language on formal occasions, including in education.
Relations between Tehran and the Iraqi Kurdish authorities have worsened
throughout the year, and threaten a new twist to the complex politics of the
region.
Iran issues frequent warnings about the 'godless and morally corrupt
situation' in Iraqi Kurdistan, and its troops held a security zone inside
Kurdish Iraq between April and August, prompting protests from Baghdad.
Among the Iranian bugbears is the Kurdish radio and TV now beamed into Iran
from Iraqi Kurdistan and offering a mixture of news, views and music. One
aged villager near Baneh, whose son was recently arrested for grazing his
sheep too close to an Iranian military position, tunes in to the station: 'I
don't like Tehran radio, I want a programme in my own language,' he says.
Ordinary Kurds in the Baneh region say life is worse than under the Shah,
overthrown by the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
The poor state of the Iranian economy, with high inflation and unemployment
after the devaluation of the rial in March, has hit the Kurdish regions
hard, compounding the sense of discrimination in one of the poorest parts of
Iran.
The KDPI has a long-established policy of eschewing terrorism which has
survived the assassination of its past two leaders, Mr Abdolrahman Qassemlou
in Vienna in 1989 and Mr Sadiq Sherefkindi in Berlin last year. 'I want to
talk to people with my tongue, not with my Kalashnikov,' says Mr Ali Azizi,
a peshmarga commander. The KDPI moved its headquarters in August from Bollay
to Koisanjaq, some 45 miles from the border and beyond the range of Iranian
artillery.
Casualty figures are hard to come by. Tehran says nothing. The KDPI is
anxious to play down the importance of its bases inside Iraqi Kurdistan and
insists its primary work in Iran is organisational rather than military.
Mr Mustapha Hijri, KDPI general secretary, says 'more than 50' pasdaran have
been killed since April, but a cursory listen to KDPI radio and
conversations with peshmerga suggest the real figure is higher.
Mr Hijri is convinced the struggle is tilting in the Kurds' favour. 'We will
carry out more attacks. I believe we will win'. His fear is that the Iraqi
Kurds, beleaguered by President Saddam Hussein and desperate for friends in
the region, will yield to Tehran's pressure and insist the KDPI leave. 'I
have not thought where we would go then,' he says.

FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (34): Global village gathers speed - Mickey
Kantor argues that, while other economies move towards greater openness,
European protectionist impulses are growing / Guest column
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICKEY KANTOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN NOVEMBER, the United States will host a very important meeting in
Seattle, the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) gathering of foreign,
economic and trade ministers, as well as a meeting of Apec leaders.
While most people have never heard of Apec, I would wager that this will
change in the next few years. As a new organisation, it is growing in
importance and taking on a greater role in facilitating commerce in Asia.
Meanwhile, we have completed negotiations on supplemental agreements on the
environment and labour to the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta)
and are working towards its passage in the US congress.
President Clinton has made clear he supports additional countries in South
America joining Nafta, assuming they have made the proper steps towards
trade opening and expansion in order to create jobs and spur economic
growth.
With Apec and Nafta, the United States is taking advantage of the two
fastest growing areas in the world: Asia and Latin America. Many of those
countries have chosen, in recent years, to cast off the controls on their
economies and the shackles on their political systems.
The Asia Pacific region has had the fastest growth in the world for 30
years. East Asia is the number one export market for US products. US
trans-Pacific trade was 50 per cent more than its trans-Atlantic trade in
1992.
Since 1989, US exports to Latin America and the Caribbean have increased
more than 50 per cent and are growing at more than twice the rate of US
exports to the rest of the world, making this region our second fastest
growing market. They have become a growing market for US products; 43 per
cent of Latin American imports come from the US.
Meanwhile, while the economies of most of the world are moving towards
greater openness, European protectionist impulses are growing, particularly
in the areas of autos and agriculture.
The most recent example is France's insistence on renegotiating the Blair
House Accord, which would reduce agricultural subsidies tied to production.
The French position, which threatens the entire Uruguay Round, is opposed by
nearly every country, especially those that export agricultural products.
This leaves some wondering if the United States is turning away from Europe
 -its ally and close trading partner for decades. Others worry that the
world is entering a period with regional trading blocs competing against
each other.
The United States will have an active role in Europe for as long as we can
see. Our desire in Europe is to have greater access for US goods, not to see
US businesses focus on other parts of the globe. If Europe blocks efforts to
expand trade, it will be hurting itself most. US trade will continue to
expand with Asia and Latin America, and Europe will be left out.
As to the concern for regional trading arrangements, they have emerged as a
new tier in the world trading system. The fact is, they are here to stay.
The question is whether they will facilitate global trade, or hinder it and
result in competing blocs.
The Clinton administration believes they can be used to facilitate global
trade by two methods. First, they can prepare developing nations for
admittance into the global trading system. Second, they can serve as a
complement to global trading arrangements and a way to lubricate those
negotiations when they are stuck.
For example, one of the greatest trade priorities of this administration -
if not the greatest priority - is to complete the Uruguay Round and then
move into further discussions that will reduce trade barriers worldwide.
The Uruguay Round has taken seven years, an absurd length of time,
especially when a good part of that period has been characterised by a
global recession which would have been eased by the reduction of trade
barriers that would result from completion of the Round.
Issues that will arise in future Gatt discussion, such as environmental
co-operation and investment, will be discussed by the nations of Apec. To
the extent that the United States can move an issue forward in regional
trade discussions when it is stalemated in global discussions, it will do
so.
The United States supports a stronger, more active Apec that will take on a
role as a forum for consultations on trade policy and expansion of trade and
investment with a goal of lowering trade barriers in-the region and
supporting the multilateral system. While Apec is still evolving, it is
clear that it is developing into just such an organisation.
The Clinton administration's trade policy is based on a new reality: we are
living in a post-Cold War global economy. We are committed to building the
strongest, most productive, most competitive economy in the world and
expanding high wage and high skill job opportunities for United States
workers.
We are finally facing the fact that our economy, as well as the global
economy is changing. Economies of the world are no longer self-contained. We
all compete in a global economy, where capital and technology are mobile.
These trends are here to stay. The question is not whether we adapt to them,
but how.
Our economic strategy - reducing our budget deficit, health care reform,
reinventing government, changes in education, worker training and investing
in technology - works in pursuit of the same objective: to build a more
productive and competitive economy.
Our trade policy is an essential part of that strategy. Opening up new
markets is the key to new job creation and economic growth.
So the United States is anxious to seek out opportunities in areas of fast
growth, such as Asia and Latin America, with the hope that new trade
agreements in those areas will increase opportunities for US companies and
workers, while also moving multilateral talks forward.
But the existence of the new global economy is also a fact for Europeans
workers. Concluding talks such as the Uruguay Round will ultimately help
European workers and consumers, it should be remembered.
These regional trading arrangements - with Nafta, an actual free trade
agreement; with Apec, a forum for discussions among the most dynamic
economies in the world - ensure that these nations continue to grow, that
they are brought into the global trading system.
In addition, these arrangements ensure that the movement towards more
democratic governments and more open political and economic systems - which
triggered the energetic growth in Asia and Latin America - will continue.
So we are not turning away from old responsibilities in Europe; we are
embracing new responsibilities and engagement in Asia and the Americas.

FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (32): A helping hand from shared ideas / A look
at an initiative that has brought together companies from three European
countries to learn from each other's experiences - Supporting exports, The
ICDP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ADVENT of the European Single Market has meant that companies large and
small are increasingly being cajoled to adopt an 'export-or-die' approach to
their business.
But, for the small or medium-sized business with limited management
resources and little experience outside its traditional home market, the
effort needed to break into an export market can be a bewildering and even
traumatic experience.
It was with such companies in mind that an initiative was taken several
years ago by the Irish Productivity Centre (IPC) - an organisation jointly
funded by the Irish Business and Employers' Confederation and the Irish
Congress of Trade Unions - to bring together a group of small but expanding
companies, from different countries and business cultures, in order that
they might learn and swap experiences.
Called the International Company Development Programme (ICDP), Ireland,
Denmark and the Netherlands each selected six companies to participate in an
18-month programme of seminars and workshops. The Dutch Institute for Small
and Medium Craft Businesses (CIMK) and the Jutland Institute of Technology
co-ordinated the programme with the IPC.
'The focus of the programme was on management development, to develop a team
rather than individuals,' says Tom McGuinness of the IPC. 'The idea was that
the participating companies would develop a strategic development plan to
make them more competitive and give them greater export potential'.
The first programme ran from 1989 to 1990, and for some companies it meant
that up to 20 per cent of management effort was taken up over this period in
attending and preparing for the seminars and workshops.
'The main problem was the release of people,' Mr McGuinness said. 'There was
always a temptation for production managers not to attend, while the whole
point was precisely to get managers not normally associated with the export
side of the business there and to understand their role as part of a team.'
Most believed, however, that the programme represented management time well
spent. Rob Zaadnoordijk, the sales director of a yacht-building firm Fripol
BV near Amsterdam, said that his company had benefitted from the project.
'We are now working much more intensively on our export business,' he said.
'The EC borders are now open, so our home market is much bigger and there is
much more competition. The really important thing we learned is that we have
to be much more competitive.'
He said the programme made clear that 'it is not enough to say we are
European to be European. Each country has its own culture and own particular
way of doing business'.
Jan Klingeman, managing director of Spijkstaal - a Dutch company with a
Fl30m annual turnover, which manufactures electric vehicles and truck bodies
 -said his five-strong management team used the programme 'to find out how
we can better go about getting foreign customers'. He said that while it has
since taken three years to begin developing the export side of the business,
it was precisely the ICDP programme that made them realise that this time
was needed to prepare the company thoroughly.
'Now we are ready to go looking abroad. We have taken over another company
and largely closed down another arm of the business. That has taken a lot of
time. But the experience of the development programme helped us to plan more
strategically and we are now better prepared to go into the export market'.
The need for preparation was one of the strongest messages to come out of
the programme according to Mr McGuinness. 'Costs associated with exporting
are greater and profit margins are often smaller,' he said.
'Preparation is very important. Many small companies are not prepared
sufficiently and exporting is not necessarily the best approach. If you
cannot service the home market profitably it is unlikely you will have
success in the export market.'
A more ambitious programme undertaken in 1991 involving Ireland, Denmark,
Spain, Portugal and Scotland was run over a period of 13 months instead of
18.
But it was less successful according to Mr McGuinness. 'There is an
exponential rise in difficulties with the number of countries
participating,' he said. Organisation was more complex and participants did
not interact as well, tending to stay within their own language groups, he
added.
Nevertheless participants reacted positively. 'It succeeded in getting
everybody pointing in the same direction. We found we were not unique with
our problems and it led us to take the conscious decision that we should
look at the British Isles as our home market and not just Ireland,' said
Tony Gillespie, marketing manager of Solids Technology, an Irish company
specialising in the separation and treatment of slurry wastes.
'We also spend more time now on strategic thinking. For instance, we have
decided that licensing our technology in the United States rather than
exporting from Ireland is a better option because of exchange rate
uncertainty and because we cannot afford to dedicate the resources that an
export strategy requires,' Mr Gillespie said.
John Harris, production director of Printech, an Irish company producing
computer manuals was enthusiastic about the project. 'It was an excellent
programme. It gave us a platform from which to understand other markets and
cultures and helped us develop our middle management'. Company work
practices had changed as a result, he said with more flexibility and less
demarcation on production lines now than in the past. Printech now generates
10 per cent of its Pounds 20m turnover from exports.
Oddly, neither of the two programmes involved any structured follow-up, a
fact which most companies said would have been helpful. 'There is a wealth
of knowledge out there, but not enough co-operation. The experience gained
is not being fully utilised,' one manager said.

FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (31): Cost a crucial component - While British
exporters frequently complain of overcharging, Mushtak Parker finds that
competition on the continent prevents the practice / How to pick a partner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
For small and medium sized exporters, freight charges can often make or
break a contract. Marginal savings on freight costs can also contribute to
cash flow. In some export markets, such as the oil-rich Gulf the freight
factor is a predominant issue.
'For lighter fuel exports, for instance, on the price per dozen CFR Dubai,
an importer will argue on two or three pence per dozen, saying that his
profit margin is only 2 per cent or so,' says Phillip Ballie, export manager
of Ukexx Ballie which has an annual turnover of Pounds 500,000 and sells
German-made time and light-sensitive printing plates to Africa, the Middle
East and the West Indies.
Since freight costs - especially in landlocked developing countries such as
the CIS - make up almost half export earnings, according to a United Nations
report, managing those costs is crucial to success as an exporter. Small
exporters must decide whether to leave decisions in the hands of their
forwarders or handle the freight buying themselves. Choosing the right
freight forwarder is therefore imperative.
A common complaint of small and medium-sized British exporters is that they
are often overcharged. Some forwarders negotiate discounts with shippers and
neglect to subtract the discount from the cost to exporters.
At 5 per cent, this could well make the difference between winning a
contract and losing it to competitors and often leads to a dispute between
the exporter and the forwarder. Top exporters can always buy the best rates,
but the small exporter has no such buying power and often suffers as a
result.
According to Mr Baillie of Ukexx, primarily a UK-based buying house for a
Nigerian company, the practice of overcharging is rife. 'You could pick up a
phone and speak to half a dozen agents and you will be quoted six different
rates. It is a question of building up a relationship with your agent,' he
says.
'Small exporters do not have the luxury of an in-house freight forwarding
department, which would include a representative of a forwarding firm, which
would charge the company on an agency basis,' Mr Baillie adds.
The British industry's trade body, the British International Freight
Association (Bifa), whose membership comprises some 60 per cent of small and
medium-sized companies, acknowledges that there is a problem but blames the
government at least for contributing to it.
Bifa says that little support has come from government for any form of
statutory regulation, whether through the bonding or licensing of
forwarders. Further, underwriters have been reluctant to accept the
perceived risks the forwarder is exposed to, with the result that freight
forwarding has become a free for all.
Some British exporters and freight forwarders rue the fact that the Office
of Fair Trading has done away with the standard charges and itemised tariffs
on the grounds that this represented a cartel with price-fixing.
'Because of the nature of how UK Plc operates - under market principles -
the ethos is: 'Let the Buyer (of services) Beware'. Unless he is familiar
with the market and understands how it works, he is vulnerable,' says Bifa's
divisional manager Colin Beaumont.
'The market ethic is: 'You charge what you can get away with'. The problem
is a symptom of market economics and is having a detrimental effect on small
business.'
Attempts are being made to halt the practice of overcharging. Through its
'New Exporter Initiative', introduced three years ago, Bifa introduced new
exporters to a range of freight companies. They were advised as to what
questions exporters should ask their freight forwarders, what priorities
should be outlined and what freight costs exporters were likely to come up
against.
Exporters are given a list of accredited members, says Mr Beaumont, and the
association trains staff of member companies and urges any exporter who has
a complaint against a forwarder who is a member of Bifa to report it.
But Bifa itself has come in for criticism from its members. 'A great deal
more could have been done in the past to strengthen the image of freight
forwarders,' says Mike Guinn, a regional director with the Swiss-based
Kuehne &amp; Nagel (K&amp;N) and former chairman of the Bristol-based M&amp;M Services,
which K&amp;N bought from the receivers earlier this year. 'Minimum standards
and rates should have been introduced from the start. The industry had its
own salvation in its hands. It has failed itself.'
Mr Guinn concedes, however, that regulations concerning the licensing of
freight companies in the UK are not as tough as those in some other EC
countries.
Across the channel, overcharging is almost non-existent because of the
intense competition in the sector. Jean Claude de Gassart, general manager
of the Federation Francaise des Organisateurs Commissionaires de Transport
(FFOCT), says few complaints are made against its 2,200-strong members.
'Freight forwarding services must be paid for. If they are too expensive,
then an exporter will find another freight company. There is sufficient
competition to find the right forwarder at the right price,' he says.
Freight officials in the Netherlands maintain that competition is so severe
that overcharging is not possible. 'Exporters and importers will always
complain against charges,' says Han Van Os, general manager of the
Netherlands Association for Forwarding &amp; Logistics.
'Profit margins in the freight transport sector are marginal. But a freight
company has to make a profit in order to survive. Dutch law allows exporters
to do their own forwarding. If they are concerned about the rates then they
can do it themselves for less,' he says.
Licensing requirements in Britain differ greatly from those in leading
countries on the continent. FFOCT's Mr De Gassart is concerned that the
opening of the EC's internal frontiers has created an uneven playing field
in the freight transport sector and wants to see a uniform set of EC
regulations governing the industry in all member states.
French forwarders are wary of differences in licensing regulations in
developing EC states, which are deemed lax and which supposedly give firms
from those countries a competitive edge. They also worry about competition
from emerging eastern European forwarders and those from the Maghreb
countries.
French freight industry licensing criteria requires a company to have a
manager with at least 10 year's experience and a diploma in general
education, a clean record as far as fraud and tax irregularities are
concerned and certain capital provisions.
The regulations governing the licence to trade in Germany vary depending on
what type of freight company is being set up, says Mr Reinhardt Lankes of
the Bundesverband Spedition Lageri EV (BSL). Because of the strict licensing
scheme in operation, the BSL - which has 5,000 members across the freight
transport sector - does not have membership criteria or conditions other
than the licence itself. Mr Lankes claims that the freight sector is well
regulated and problems of overcharging are not common.
What then is the advice to exporters when choosing a freight forwarder?
Most exporters choose a freight forwarder because they either know one or
have been recommended one. 'The important thing is that you trust your agent
at the end of the day. I am prepared to pay for a good service. After all
the agent takes care of all the documentation and certificates of origin,'
says Mr Ballie of Ukexx.
Bifa's Mr Beaumont believes that exporters must look around the market. They
must understand what their own requirements are and should contact the
association that could then help them through outlets such as exports clubs
and one stop shops.
'We do feed all these networks to try to advise exporters what they need.
People tend not to get advice until they have a problem,' says Mr Beaumont.
Freight forwarders such as Mr Guinn of K&amp;N, on the other hand, urge
exporters to try to find companies that give a personal service and those
with a good local office. 'It is all about people. There are about 10 top
freight forwarders in the EC and you, as an exporter, should find one you
will be comfortable with.'
Exporters want to cut costs and reduce the number of contractors in the
supply chain. David Grant, marketing director of P&amp;O Containers Europe,
whose clients include small, medium and large exporters, says the freight
majors such as P&amp;O guarantee quality and service standards.
He advises export firms to do their homework and to look at all the options,
door-to-door type of price (inland costs, fixed rate costs, warehouse and
distribution costs), efficiency and the level of service offered.

FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (30): Small is still beautiful - Mushtak Parker
finds that, despite a wave of mergers and acquisitions, there will always be
a demand for small and medium-sized operators / Freight forwarders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MUSHTAK PARKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE acquisition of Bristol-based freight forwarder M&amp;M Services from the
receivers last July by the Swiss-based freight giant Kuehne &amp; Nagel (K&amp;N)
reflects the uncertainty independent and small freight companies are facing.
The feeling among independent operators is that as the recession in the
European Community continues to bite, small and medium-sized freight
forwarders will find it hard to survive. M&amp;M Services, with an annual
turnover of about Dollars 8m, was once the Rolls Royce of the freight
forwarding industry, but with profit margins and commissions reduced, it
became impossible to compete with the pricing power of the freight majors.
According to a former M&amp;M Services chairman Mike Guinn, now a regional
director with K&amp;N, losses sustained by the independents and small freight
companies through mergers of bankruptcies is a worldwide problem. 'We could
not survive because our ability to give the level required by the industry
was not sustainable,' he says. 'Investment in tracking services and
computerisation requires a lot of money which only the majors can afford.
Ours was a personal service and not one dictated by computers.'
A mixture of mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures, cross-border
alliances, management buy-outs or simply bankruptcy has swept across the
industry in the past year.
A survey by Dutch management consultancy Van der Geer and Van Hasenbroek
carried out earlier this year found that in the five years from 1988, some
200 acquisitions took place in the Dutch road haulage sector alone. British
and US firms accounted for a third of the takeovers. In France, bankruptcies
among road hauliers during last year increased by 2.5 per cent on the
previous year.
Some independents such as Communication Rapide Inter-Enterprises (CRIE), the
French integrator in the international parcels express sector, whose clients
include Peugeot, Renault, Barclays Bank and Digital, are maintaining market
share by offering a flexible service. CRIE claims a 10 per cent share of the
international express market from France.
With the European freight distribution market exceeding Ecu160bn (Pounds
122bn), the stakes are high. Some cross-border mergers and strategic
alliances have been spurred by the perceived opportunities in the Single
Market.
But most multinationals, while cutting costs, are acquiring companies in
target markets, then consolidating to meet local freight transport needs.
Sometimes the strategy does not work, but the effect is felt across the
sector. US express parcels company Federal Express (FedEx) made heavy losses
attempting to establish itself in the UK, and was forced to pull out.
The consensus is, however, that small and medium-sized freight forwarders
have a role to play. 'There will always be a need for small freight
companies,' says Colin Beaumont, divisional manager of the British
International Freight Association, whose membership comprises 60 per cent
small and medium-sized companies. 'From time to time you will have mergers
and acquisitions and this is a reasonably healthy process.
'It is not a trend. It has happened all the time. I would say that there
have not been more bankruptcies and takeovers during the recession that in
normal operating times. Freight forwarding is a fragmented and a niche
market business,' Mr Beaumont says.
At the other end of the industry, alignment, mergers and contractions are
needed to maintain margins or to stay in business. Analysts do not see this
changing. David Grant, marketing director of P&amp;O containers Europe, stresses
that the big companies are not getting bigger. 'Companies are helping each
other out and the trend is no different from any other business or sector.
'Joint ventures and other alliances offer opportunities to reduce costs.
Smaller operators will have to look at their niche markets and work with
bigger companies to capitalise in terms of efficiencies and investment
opportunities into computer systems and EDI (Electronic Data Interchange)
networks,' Mr Grant says.
The leading freight operators claim that they are not making big profits,
but rationalisation does mean better rates, services and greater efficiency.
Mr Grant acknowledges that the large operators do have a responsibility to
the industry and partnership is definitely a trend but he remains optimistic
about prospects for forwarders. 'The recession offers opportunities as well.
The international movement of goods does not necessarily go down,' he says.
But Mr Guinn says he would not even consider starting a venture such as M&amp;M
Services now. 'We've been fortunate, despite the receivership. At K&amp;N there
are the inevitable changes and these have been fairly painless. The
acquisition has gone as well as one could have hoped for. In the
circumstances this was the best deal for M&amp;M Services creditors, customers
and employees.'

FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (29): Industry facing radical change / A look at
an industry in crisis as margins are reduced and carriers and forwarders
compete for a declining amount of business - Freight movement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY BUSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH margins being squeezed ever more tightly as competition increases for
less business, the freight industry is having to deal with a number of new
pressures that are forcing carriers and forwarders to rethink their
operations.
For the trader, the future promises great benefits with faster and more
efficient clearances of exports and imports. The frustration for the freight
industry is that it can do little to influence its destiny. 'We are entirely
dependent on world trade and can only respond to what the markets require to
be moved,' says Jim White, director general of the British International
Freight Association (Bifa).
'And if the over-tonnage in the deep sea, air markets and within European
transport, both road and rail, continues then the pressure on margins is
going to make it difficult for any freight intermediary to achieve the
amounts needed to be spent on training and new information technology.'
Across Europe the transport picture is similar. Companies are being hard
hit, says a spokeswoman for the Union International des Transports Routiers
in Geneva.
Increased competition for less business is causing a round of price cutting,
she says, while fuel taxes are adding further pressure. 'Although we're
hoping things will get better, in general we're still in crisis.'
Winifred Rockman, head of the Brussels-based European Liaison Commitees for
Road Transport, describes the situation as critical, with hauliers being
forced to cut their prices by between 10 and 20 per cent. Among the hardest
hit countries are Spain and Italy, he says.
But the fact that the number of haulage companies operating in Europe has
increased - in spite of the downturn in business - shows that smaller
specialist companies will always have a role to play, Mr Rockman says.
On British roads, while loads carried have been increasing, the number of
vehicles has been falling. Simon Chapman, economist at the Freight Transport
Association, says the sector has been badly hit by recession. 'The industry
has been affected since 1990 and this is reflected by the number of
registered lorries.
According to Mr Chapman, 478,000 vehicles of more than 3.5 tonnes were on
the roads in 1989. This number fell to 460,000 by 1990, to 430,000 by 1991
and to 415,000 at the end of 1992.
While the industry was cheered by predictions that the Single Market would
increase intra-European trade by 7 per cent, there were two prices to pay -
one of lost jobs and the other of extra work.
At the start of this year, Bifa estimated that up to 100,000 customs brokers
throughout the European Community would be made redundant but, at the same
time, EC governments made it clear that they still expected freight movement
statistics to be collected.
Forwarders found themselves having to take on the role of the fiscal and
information brokers, providing data such as VAT details on behalf of clients
as well as duty and tax information.
Forwarders are also expected to supply trade statistics and other
information needed at consignment level to help Customs units prevent
smuggling.
In Britain, it was quickly seen that the key to beating European rivals in
this area would be the introduction of electronic trading systems between
trader, forwarder and Customs units.
Last November Bifa launched Bifanet, an electronic trading service developed
jointly with General Electric Information Services, a division of General
Electric of the US. The system gives even the smallest companies access to
state-of-the-art technology.
No equivalent has yet been established on the continent, but Portugal, Spain
and Denmark are looking at the system to see if they can adapt it to their
needs.
Although the forwarder may be prepared to take on these extra tasks,
Britain's Institute of Export points out that the onus is on the exporter
himself to provide trade statistic returns. 'I'm sure exporters could do it
themselves and Customs might prefer this, rather than getting the
information secondhand, but most companies have always been used to leaving
this side of things to their forwarders or consolidators,' Tony Symes, the
institute's freight spokesman, said.
The implications of the Channel tunnel for the freight industry present
uncertainty.
The Institute of Export says little detail is available so far on how it
will operate. But it concedes that, while the French are planning how to use
it, in Britain it is likely that people will 'shut their eyes until the
tunnel opens and then see how it's going to work'.
Developments in the area of security within the British freight industry are
soon to be enshrined in the Aviation and Maritime Security Act. According to
the Department of Transport, the code will be a voluntary one.
The act applies only to the UK but the Civil Aviation Authority is promoting
its principles to its continental counterparts.
Air cargo agents will be able to apply for security listing, thereby
becoming legally responsible for subjecting cargo in their possession to
security screening and searching before delivering it to airlines.
Those who apply will be required to:
provide satisfactory statements of their current security procedures;
show that premises where cargo is handled are physically secure and that
they have appropriate control on access and;
demonstrate that they can comply with 'directions' when issued. It is
expected that the first directions concerning audits, tests and inspections
will be issued early next year.
While the department specifies a 'voluntary framework', air cargo agents
will inevitably feel they have to meet the department's requirements in
order to attract or keep customers.
This month sees the introduction in Britain of Chief (Customs Handling of
Import or Export Freight), an enhanced version of Deps (the Departmental
Entry Processing System) which allows traders to put their information
directly into the Customs' system. Traders can pre-enter imports and exports
without waiting for the paperwork to catch up.
Installing the new system will be relatively cheap as it entails simply
updating what traders have already been using. Customs estimates that the
required software will cost the small operator between Pounds 500 and Pounds
600 and perhaps double that for bigger concerns.
Customs feels it is a price worth paying. 'Manual clearances will still be
possible,' the Customs spokesman said. 'But, if they do join, they will be
hooked into what we consider to be the most efficient freight handling
system there is.'

FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (27): Little cause for celebration - Recession
and dramatic changes in European exchange rates are not helping France's
renowned champagne house / Company profile of Moet-et-Chandon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR decades the champagnes from the vineyards around the cities of Reims and
Epernay in eastern France have been among the most profitable and
prestigious areas of French exports.
One of the chief catalysts of champagne's export success has been
Moet-et-Chandon, the grand old Epernay champagne house that now belongs to
LVMH, the powerful luxury goods group. Moet, which was founded in 1743, has
devoted years to establishing its brand as the world's best-selling
champagne.
Moet-et-Chandon, like the rest of the champagne industry, has had a tough
time in recent months, not least because of the effect of the dramatic
changes in European exchange rates on its export sales. The company has had
not only to grapple with the effects of the recession on worldwide demand
for champagne, but has also had to revise its pricing policy because of
France's franc fort policy of maintaining a strong franc.
The problems of Moet are illustrative, not only of the particular
difficulties of the champagne trade, but also of the general pressures on
other French exporters since last autumn's currency crisis strengthened the
franc against other currencies.
Exports were, until recently, one of the chief sources of growth for the
French economy. For most of last year French companies were able to
compensate for the low level of domestic demand by winning market share in
other countries. The value of French exports rose by 6.5 per cent in 1992,
according to the economy ministry, and the trading account swung from a
FFr29.6bn deficit into a FFr30.6bn credit.
But last autumn's currency crisis, which strengthened the franc against
other European currencies - notably the lira, peseta and sterling - made
life more difficult for French exporters. Their problems began in the final
quarter of 1992, but intensified early this year. The trading account has
stayed in the black: but only because of a sharp decline in imports.
Champagne, already struggling against the parallel problems of weak demand
and over-production, has been one of the most vulnerable areas of French
industry. Champagne exports peaked at 94.3m bottles in 1989, according to
the Comite Interprofessionel du Vin de Champagne, but then fell steadily to
73.8m bottles in 1992.
The franc's strength after the currency crisis was the final straw for the
industry. Exports levels seemed to rally in the first half of this year -
reaching 25m bottles against 23.6m in the same period of 1992 - but only
because of the steep increase in sales of cheap petits champagnes at the
expense of the established brands.
Moet, which represents around 7 per cent of the total champagne market, has
suffered with the rest of the industry. By the first quarter of this year it
was acutely concerned not only about the low level of sales in
recession-struck France, but also that the strong franc was making its
product seem too expensive in other countries.
LVMH announced in February that it was 'temporarily' cutting the wholesale
price of Moet - and also of Mercier champagne - by 10 per cent in France,
Germany and Switzerland to try to rekindle demand. Under ordinary
circumstances it would almost certainly have cut prices by the same amount
elsewhere in Europe.
But the franc's strength also raised the risk of an influx of parallel
imports of Moet into France and Germany, from countries with weaker
currencies, such as the UK, Spain and Italy. Instead of trimming its prices
in those markets, LVMH was forced to raise them by 5 per cent.
The decision to revise Moet's pricing policy was not taken easily. Moet,
like every other champagne house, was anxious about the effect cutting
prices would have on the prestigious image of its product. It was also
concerned that its wholesale customers in France, Germany and Switzerland
might not pass the reductions on to their retail clients. As a result it
would have reduced its own margins and imperilled the status of its brand
without gaining from higher sales.
Further, the need to raise prices in the UK, Italy and Spain raised the risk
of further depressing sales in those markets. This was one of the factors
that prompted Moet this spring to announce a job-cutting plan which has
brought it into fierce conflict with the trade unions.
In spite of these difficulties Moet has stuck to its new policy. It says
that demand is still weak in most European markets, although it has detected
a slight improvement since the franc's fall following this summer's ERM
crisis. However, there are more encouraging signs in the US as the recession
ends, and in the UK, even after the price rises.

AS CHAIRMAN of one of Europe's fastest growing manufacturers of weighing
equipment, Lars Grundtvig thought he was hardened to the problems of being
an exporter. 'Weights and measures have been a sensitive subject since the
Roman balance was invented,' says Mr Grundtvig, from Danish firm Scanvaegt.
'And not surprisingly, since scales are so bound up with measuring money.'
The company is still smarting, however, from a two-year battle to gain
approval to sell its products on the French market. The experience has left
it wary about the frustrations and delays that can be involved in fulfilling
another country's technical specifications. It is also seeking compensation
for lost money and time in the European Court, on the grounds that the
actions of French officials constituted an unfair impediment to free trade.
More than 90 per cent of Scanvaegt's specialised equipment for the food
industry is exported and the company was bullish about its prospects in the
French agricultural sector following the introduction of the Single Market.
'There has been considerable loosening in the weighing sector in recent
years,' says Mr Grundtvig. 'Generally, a machine that has been tested and
approved in one country will be approved in all. We have had no problems in
selling our equipment to Scandinavia, Germany or Britain - or even further
away to the US or Middle East.'
Scanvaegt's semi-automatic weighing machines had been approved by an
EC-approved testing centre in Denmark and sold in 11 other European
countries. Moreover, a common European directive covering this type of
equipment was issued in June 1990, just a month after Scanvaegt set up a
subsidiary in Brittany, and won a large order to supply equipment for a
factory being set up by the Anglo-French poultry concern Bourgoin Moy Park.
Scanvaegt feels that its application for approval of equipment was from the
outset met with undue delays, conflicting instructions and bureaucratic
hindrances. The company says this was despite its best attempts to comply
with escalating demands, attempts that put half its research and development
team working flat out for several months in order to modify the machines.
The French weights and measures department initially said it could only
consider granting licences for machines fitted with electromechanical load
cells that had been approved in France. In a bid to speed up the process,
Scanvaegt consented to switch from British/Dutch made parts.
But its dismay mounted during the two months of telephone calls,
letter-writing and intercession by the Danish embassy that it took just to
obtain a list of approved manufacturers of load cells.
Scanvaegt became increasingly caught up in the immense complexity of the
French regulations, contained in a series of intermeshing decrees dating
back as far as 1941.
France was also in the process of decentralising: a confusion between the
Brittany weights and measures office and Paris headquarters over the
paperwork that ought to accompany the application meant the company was sent
to the back of the queue in November.
'It took seven months just to get to the point of submitting an acceptable
application,' said Mr Grundtvig. 'In the rest of Europe, the entire
procedure has taken typically between two to three hours and two weeks.'
Then began a lengthy process of arranging to install modified versions of
the machines at various test sites in France. Once again, several design
changes were requested - some of which Scanvaegt successfully contested on
the grounds that they would have been unhealthy in machines used in the food
industry - and communications were answered late or not at all. The company
says it was surprised to find several other, French-made machines on the
market which had not been patent-approved, but to which the authorities had
apparently decided to turn a blind eye.
Gradually, it became a race against the clock. Bourgoin Moy Park was keen to
have the Scanvaegt machines and it installed three for non-commercial, test
purposes, but eventually warned that it might be forced to switch to another
supplier. 'We had spent a year dancing around after the French pipe and
fulfilling all their demands, and in the end we only succeeded by kicking in
the door with some SAS-style methods,' says Mr Grundtvig.
The Danish industry minister was eventually persuaded to write to her French
counterpart to complain about a breach of Article 30 of the Treaty of Rome -
relating to unlawful impediments to trade - and had to admit publicly that
her letter went unanswered for weeks.
The political pressure did eventually bear fruit: after almost two years,
the applications were suddenly granted.
Scanvaegt is now pursuing an application for approval of its automatic
weighing machines, for which an EC directive is still being drawn up, but is
happy to report smoother progress. So far the procedure has only taken five
months and the company feels that the French market will undoubtedly prove a
good one to be operating in. It finds it harder to forgive the past and is
still pursuing its claim for compensation from the French authorities for
all the extra costs involved in testing through the European Court.

FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (24): UK body steps into the breach - The Single
Market Compliance Unit is resolving a large number of complaints while
others may not yet have come to light - Illegal trade barriers / The SMCU
</HEADLINE>

BRITISH exporters who feel their European sales are being hampered by
illegal trade barriers have a white knight to turn to at the Department of
Trade and Industry.
Any company that believes its products have been rejected by an invidious
application of 'national standards' or some other unfair ploy, can appeal to
the Single Market Compliance Unit (SMCU)*, set up by the department to
resolve difficulties caused by breaches of EC rules.
The unit, created four years ago, has recently been expanded to deal with
increasing numbers of complaints about alleged breaches. Its caseload has
risen from five in 1989 to 19 in 1990, 28 in 1991, 58 in 1992 and to more
than 60 so far this year.
The unit believes many other cases may not yet have come to light. 'The
problems brought to us appear to be fairly typical of those that UK business
faces, although the extent of those problems can be hard to judge,' a
spokesman for SMCU said.
Because exporters often find a way round particular problems and are
reluctant to complain, these problems are not exposed and resolved in the
long term.
Even those companies that do take their troubles to the unit, do not want
publicity. 'Everything we do for the exporter is treated confidentially,'
says the DTI. As a result, SMCU triumphs rarely make the headlines. As the
unit gains experience in tackling certain issues, its success rate is
expanding.
But it recoils at the idea that it might be seen as a 'quick fix' body and
points out that results are rarely swift and cases are seldom clear cut.
Often, the SMCU is seen as a place of last resort. Cases are referred to the
unit by MPs, MEPs, ministers, embassies and trade associations.
When a complaint is taken to the unit, the evidence is assessed and, if the
unit feels a case exists, it calls on other Whitehall departments or British
embassies for the technical and regional expertise needed to confirm whether
a breach has occured. Thereafter a course of action is agreed upon with the
exporter.
Actions open to the unit include taking the matter up with a member state
through Brussels, getting ministers to contact their counterpart in the
member state concerned and asking ambassadors to raise the issue with the
ministry concerned.
If these bilateral approaches fail, a case can be referred to the European
Commission by the complainant, with the SMCU acting in an advisory role. The
Commission may then initiate 'infraction proceedings' but these can take two
or three years to reach a resolution.
Complaints include failure to recognise common standards, refusal to comply
with public procurement rules, an exporter not being given a test date for a
product and delays in receiving the test results.
The question of national standards being used to block trade is particularly
vexing at a time when the Community is moving towards spreading the use of
its own harmonised mark of conformity: CE marking. Any product bearing the
marking will have met criteria laid down by the relevant EC New Approach
Directive - regulations concerning standards for each sector - and will be
acceptable in any country within the EC.
The idea is that national standards must be withdrawn when they conflict
with European standards. This, however, is a minefield when it comes to
compliance and a quarter of the cases the unit has taken on this year
concern standards.
In spite of the increase in complaints, the SMCU says deliberate breaches of
Community law by member states are rarer than is commonly believed.
'Most problems come about through difficulties caused by the very different
systems across the Community,' it says. 'There is little evidence of
deliberate, wide-scale, illegal practice by other member states'
authorities, but problems do occur through different interpretation of the
rules or patchy enforcement.
Although the SMCU has several contacts in other EC countries willing to
assist in resolving difficulties, the only other European country to have a
similar body is Denmark, whose industry ministry has set up what is called
the 'Hoovergang'*.
While SCMU and Hoovergang have met to exchange experiences, their contact is
infrequent because few problems arise between the UK and Denmark.

FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (26): Spreading across a wider map - The
European division of healthcare group Bristol-Myers Squibb is focusing its
sales drive on eastern Europe / Company profile of Convatec
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UXBRIDGE in west London is the European headquarters for ConvaTec, a Dollars
600m-sales-a-year division of the US healthcare group Bristol-Myers Squibb.
The company, headquartered in Princeton, New Jersey, describes itself as
world market leader in stoma care products and a leader in modern, as
opposed to traditional, chronic wound dressings. Its breakthrough came about
20 years ago with a new type of skin protective wafer.
At Deeside, north Wales, ConvaTec has its European manufacturing plant,
employing 900 people, from where it exports 75 per cent of production to
continental Europe.
In the UK some 100,000 people are incontinent post-surgery and need stoma
care products - devices to collect urine or faeces - and will do so for
life. Every year 8,000 such operations are carried out in Britain.
In spite of the scale of the UK business, this type of product can only be
sold where operations are necessary and expanding sales means expanding the
market geographically. In Europe, ConvaTec is competing with such companies
as Coloplast of Denmark, Biotrol of France, and Hollister of the US but
claims to be easily the market leader.
Mr Keith Wetherell, managing director, says ConvaTec was conceived on a
multinational basis, selling in Europe rather than only in the UK, because
that offered a much larger market and the incidence of the condition treated
is similar across Europe.
Germany is the largest single market but the company has established sales
and marketing offices in every important European market.
But it is in eastern Europe where much of ConvaTec's export drive is now
focused. Although it had been selling there for over a decade, the break-up
of the old political order meant an 'immense change in opportunity', says
Allan Manecki, vice-president of ConvaTec Europe.
'Our main customers had been the central purchasing authorities. We were
doing a lot of work with surgeons and nurses and had created an awareness
among them of our products, and of ConvaTec as an ethical company.
But awareness does not translate necessarily into what a central agency
would actually order.' When the political situation changed, Mr Manecki
said, awareness meant 'it was a case of saying do we want to be in this
market, yes we do, instead of sitting on the sidelines'.
The approach adopted by ConvaTec, while tailored to individual markets, in
eastern Europeshares three significant features with that taken in western
Europe.
Firstly, local sales and marketing teams are not agents of ConvaTec but all
employees, with implementation of policy devolved to them and product
distribution routed via the offices. 'In certain markets where there is
still a high degree of centralised decision-making then I tend to get
involved,' Mr Manecki says. 'But within other markets, say Poland, it is
left largely to the local management to develop the business within the
strategic guidelines.'
Secondly, staff are recruited locally, with English the second language of
key personnel, who come to Uxbridge to be trained. 'We are very proud that
as a company we have no expatriates,' says Mr Manecki.
'In developing the eastern European market, it is a case of finding people
of the right calibre, which is a time-consuming and difficult business. You
want a product or marketing manager, or even a sales rep, and in many
instances that is an unknown animal. Marketing skills have never really been
required under the old communist regimes.'
The third important feature of the approach is dealing directly with the
patient wherever possible. 'We are ground-breaking here in eastern Europe,'
Mr Manecki says. 'In the past the central purchasing authorities had no real
understanding of the product and we had no contact with the end users. But
reaching the patient is the essence of our business.
'We are not just interested in selling products per se to our customers. We
spend a lot of time getting to know their needs and striking up as close a
relationship as we can.' This includes support services such as freephone
advice.
Mr Wetherell says the strategy is first to approach surgical opinion
leaders. 'From them you would understand the kind of need that they see and
their units would be where the new patients are. You have to start with new
patients before you can reach existing patients.'
ConvaTec makes 300 variations of its main products to meet individual,
rather than national, requirements. But it does have to comply with
different regulatory regimes and runs its own regulatory office. Receiving
payment, Mr Manecki says, is not the problem that it might be for some
exporters because of ConvaTec's structure of local offices. 'The trading
that we are doing is essentially internal.'
In eastern Europe, as elsewhere, sales growth is influenced by the extent to
which the product's cost is reimbursed by the state, which largely
determines the number of patients who use it and the frequency of
replacement. Usage varies greatly but, for example, a British colostomy
patient might use two pouches daily at a cost to the health service of about
Pounds 1,000 a year.
ConvaTec will not disclose the scale of its investment in eastern European
or the timescale for profitability. But Mr Manecki says: 'These are not
markets where we are in for a quick profit - we see ourselves as being in
these markets for a long time.'
Mr Wetherell says the biggest hurdle is not such problems as regulatory or
bureaucratic regimes but people's reluctance to admit they have had this
type of operation and ignorance of how its consequences can be managed. 'The
real challenge is educating the universe.'

FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (25): Stamp of disapproval
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE British Post Office faced the stamp of official disapproval when it
inadvertently breached an EC public purchasing requirement.
In one of a number of complaints against the UK for failing to follow the
rules, the Post Office purchasing and supply department in Swindon came
adrift when it put out an invitation to tender for polypropylene mail bags.
The contract notice advertised in the Official Journal did not make it clear
that evidence of financial standing and technical ability would be required
before tender documents were issued.
Consequently, a German bidder complained about lack of information in the
notice and the German Ministry of Economics took up his case.
Initially, it raised the matter informally with the British Treasury, which
stopped the case going any further by admitting that this was a breach of
the open procedure public purchasing rules.
In the Post Office's defence, the Treasury said that Swindon was unfamiliar
with the open procedure, and that the German company was invited to express
interest in future contracts as they arose. This satisfied the German bidder
and the matter was resolved.

FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (22): More than just a pretty picture - Neil
Buckley discovers that the packaging of products is vital for those who want
to succeed in culturally different markets / Labelling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN KP launches its Branigans thick-cut potato crisps in Spain, the packs
will be without the drawing of Mr Branigan holding a tray of his wares
familiar to devotees of the snack in the UK.
Instead, Spanish snack-munchers will be confronted by a picture of a woman.
The company was worried that cultural differences might mean a picture of a
man engaging in the unmanly pursuit of baking would not go down well in
Spain.
For companies exporting consumer goods into foreign markets, the labelling
and packaging to be used is a crucial consideration. A simple oversight -
such as failing to take account of cultural differences - could prove costly
and difficult to rectify later.
Getting the packaging right, on the other hand, can bring rich rewards.
Galbani, the Italian cheese producer, replaced 10 different packaging
designs across Europe in 1991 with a standard one depicting the Tuscan
landscape, a Gingham table cloth and appetising dishes for each cheese.
Without any advertising, sales increased 22 per cent in the UK, 33 per cent
in Germany and 50 per cent in France within six months.
Broadly, exporters face two types of problems when labelling products for
foreign customers. Firstly, they must ensure labels comply with legislation
in the target market. Secondly, they must make choices about how to present
a product, bearing in mind cultural, historical and linguistic differences.
Labelling legislation can be complex. EC directive 79/112 covering the
labelling of foodstuffs runs to 10 pages. While EC harmonisation at least
means that a company which meets all the requirements on naming,
ingredients, quantity, use-by dates and so on in one Community country
should do so in another, there are still pitfalls.
The directive says, for example, that food producers must display
information about their products in a language easily understood by
customers in the local market.
That means manufacturers must either supply goods with labels printed in the
appropriate language, apply stickers in the appropriate language to the
original packaging, or distribute explanatory leaflets along with the
foodstuffs.
Exporters to new markets must check carefully the labelling requirements
with the authorities in that country.
Once the legal requirements have been met, companies must decide whether to
use the same labelling as they do in their home market, or to adapt it for
overseas markets.
'When you're going into a market where you have not been before, the major
priority is getting to know your audience, and finding out about the
cultural differences,' says Jan Marshall of Coley Porter Bell, the London
design consultancy.
There are obvious advantages in harmonising labelling across foreign
markets. It allows centralised marketing, saving money on advertising and
design, and keeps open the possibility of advertising via cross-border media
such as satellite television.
It also allows for a more cohesive and effective brand strategy. Devising a
strong image for a brand can actually help it to cross borders and transcend
language barriers.
There can, however, be problems with such an approach. It may be difficult
to use the same product name as some names may lose their impact in
different markets.
Moreover, names may translate badly. Marketing the anti-perspirant Body Mist
might be difficult in Germany, where 'mist' means manure or dung.
Where different names for the same product exist in different markets,
harmonising them can be difficult. But it can be done.
Mars, the US-owned food manufacturer, did it successfully with its Snickers
bar, previously known in the UK as Marathon. The change was heralded well in
advance of its introduction, with a 'flash' on the pack warning the product
was 'soon to be called Snickers'. After the name change, the flash changed
to 'formerly known as Marathon'.
Mars was helped by a strong packaging design that was the same everywhere
despite the different name.
Sometimes, manufacturers decide not to change different brand names that are
well-established in different countries, but continue to capitalise on the
customer loyalty within each country. A good example is Unilever, which
decided to retain the existing names of its main laundry detergent, known
variously as All, Omo, Persil, Presto, Skip and Via.
But it did adopt a more harmonised approach to packaging, using similar
visual devices, typography and colours, to ensure that Persil buyers from
the UK would recognise a packet of Omo as the same product if they were
confronted with it overseas.
Harmonising packaging design, however, can be difficult. Colours, for
example, are used differently in different countries. In Germany, it is
quite normal to market products for babies in bold, bright colours. In the
UK, pastel shades are more acceptable.
Pictures and images can also create problems. Nudity or semi-nudity, while
acceptable in countries such as France, is clearly out in Muslim countries.
Even if the basic design and lettering of a label is the same, companies may
decided to carry a different message or slogan on the label in different
countries.
Although Unilever launched its new Sun Progress dishwasher powder in a
standard packaging design, research in France, Germany, Italy and the UK
revealed widely differing consumer priorities.
The result was that when Sun Progress was introduced into Germany in 1990,
the packaging message stressed the product's environmental credentials. When
it was launched later in the UK, the message emphasised its value for money
and the fact that it would not cause damage to fine china.
For exporters to be successful in foreign markets, having the right product
is not enough. Just as important is presenting it the right way.

FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (23): Changing attitudes - Jeremy Miles believes
that, despite new EC directives resistance to pan-European buying will
continue - Procurement / Profile of Quasar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JEREMY MILES is a strong supporter of the European Commission's efforts to
open up the public procurement market. But he is also extremely thankful for
the fact that Quasar Microwave Technology, the company of which he is
chairman, operates in a market where there are no obvious 'national
champions'.
Quasar makes wave guides, hollow metal conductors which carry microwave
signals to and from radar and telecommunications antennae. It faces
competition from manufacturers in Italy, Germany and France, as well as from
the US, but the sector is too specialised to prompt governments to defend
large national suppliers.
Quasar, which is based in Heathfield, near Exeter, Devon, has turnover of
Pounds 3m and a workforce of 100 people. Established in 1985, it made some
over-ambitious acquisitions, says Mr Miles. He joined the company 18 months
ago at the request of the company's institutional investors to help sort out
its problems.
Europe can no longer afford to have one and sometimes even two or three
domestic champions in each member state, particularly in high technology
areas, he says. 'Deals will continue to be done on the golf course but the
public procurement directives represent an attempt to coerce the member
states to stop thinking of their public authorities and their utilities as
political tools.'
Quasar sells 60 per cent of its turnover in continental Europe either
directly to public authorities and utilities or to the main contractors
involved in projects. Mr Miles calculates that his company manages to
convert half of what he calls 'qualified enquiries' into firm orders.
In spite of his welcome for the EC directives, Mr Miles believes that it
will take some time before ingrained attitudes are changed. 'New generations
will grow up to regard pan-European buying as utterly normal but for the
time being there will be resistance,' he says.
In addition, many suppliers may be reluctant to attempt to break into new
markets because they have become so used to them being closed to foreign
manufacturers. 'Most of us have had to husband our resources and look for
softer targets. But we have to break the mould.'
The new timetables for publishing details of tenders are of symbolic rather
than practical significance, he believes. By the time a tender appears in
the Official Journal it is probably already too late, he says. Suppliers
will only win new business if they get to know their customers and their
likely requirements well in advance.
And even then a purchaser is unlikely to entrust an order for important
equipment to an unknown supplier. Initial orders are likely to be small
until the supplier has proved it can deliver a reliable product.

FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (21): Numbers crunch - Wage costs are important,
but productivity differences mean their net effect on competitiveness is
hard to calculate / Labour costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR costs play a large part in the debate about export competitiveness
because they are easy to identify, more variable than some other costs and
the subject of understandable political excitement.
Labour cost differences are, of course, important, but they also need to be
kept in perspective. In the high technology industries which are coming
increasingly to dominate international trade they often make up only a small
proportion of total costs.
In the UK computer industry, for example, total wage costs, including
national insurance contributions, represent only 15 per cent of production
costs. In electronics they represent 34 per cent and in aerospace 33 per
cent.
Manual workers wages (both skilled and unskilled) account for only 4 per
cent of production costs in computers, 13 per cent in electronics, and 23
per cent in aerospace.
Hugh Stirk, head of personnel at Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods
company, also points out that in the consumer sector the freedom to choose
where to site an export base is constrained by the need to be physically
close to consumers.
Nonetheless, there is a growing awareness that differences in wage, and
especially non-wage, labour costs between countries can affect
competitiveness. As Mr Stirk says, if it costs twice as much to employ a
senior manager in Germany as in Britain, it will eventually have some
effect.
Employers' non-wage labour costs usually cover government social security
levies plus, in some countries, pension and health payments for employees.
Average figures comparing the US, Japan and the European Community show that
in EC countries non-wage labour costs are about 24 per cent of total labour
costs, only just ahead of the 23 per cent in the US, but comfortably ahead
of Japan where they are 13 per cent.
Those averages disguise huge differences between companies and countries.
Within the EC, for example, Denmark has average non-wage labour costs of
only 3 per cent while France, Italy, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands
are all above 30 per cent.
And even within one country, such as the United States, there can be huge
differences in labour costs, depending on the sort of healthcare that
employers provide.
Combining both wage costs and non-wage costs, plus various other fringe
benefits, the latest Economist Intelligence Unit survey of hourly labour
costs in the manufacturing industry found that Germany was at the top of the
list on Dollars 25.34, and comfortably well ahead of Switzerland on Dollars
22.48.
They lead a high labour cost country list which includes Norway, Belgium,
the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Austria.
Japan comes in just above Austria towards the bottom of the predominantly
European list on Dollars 19.05. America heads a medium labour cost list with
Dollars 16.58 coming ahead of France, Italy, Finland, the UK, Ireland and
Spain. Those on the low labour cost list comprise Greece on Dollars 6.29 and
Portugal on Dollars 4.69, which is about one-sixth the German level.
Currency fluctuations can, of course, make an enormous difference. The
reason why the average EC hourly rate fell below Japan for the first time
ever this year is due to the rise of the yen. Similarly, the gap between the
US and Europe has narrowed largely because of the strength of the dollar.
Even more important, bald hourly labour cost figures take no account of
differences in productivity. The important factor for employers is not the
level of labour costs as such (and still less the non-wage cost element) but
cost relative to the value-added generated by the labour that they employ.
As the European Commission's report Employment In Europe 1993 states:
'Whatever the level of labour costs, if the contribution of a worker to
value-added is sufficiently high, then it will be profitable to employ him
or her.'
Large differences in labour costs between countries are usually balanced by
equally large variations in the level of productivity.
According to the European Commission, for example, there are only two
European Community countries - Germany and Denmark - where the level of
productivity is substantially below the relative level of labour costs.
On the other hand in four countries - the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Ireland
and Portugal - the average labour costs are significantly lower than the
relative level of productivity, which would imply low unit labour costs.
However, absolute levels of manufacturing unit labour costs are difficult to
calculate and big differences exist between the figures quoted.
The latest calculations from the Trades Union Congress, based on figures
from the US Department of Labour and the OECD, find unit labour costs in the
US, Japan and Germany, to be, respectively, only 66 per cent, 65 per cent
and 71 per cent of the UK level.
When thinking about labour costs businesses need to take into account not
only currencies and productivity but also the trends in cost differentials.
As the London Economics consultancy has pointed out a substantial
convergence of wages has taken place in the EC over the past 20 years.
Spanish wages in 1970 were 29 per cent of those in Germany; in 1990 they had
risen to 66 per cent. Italian wages in 1970 were 42 per cent of those in
Germany; by 1990 they had risen to 71 per cent. So a decision based on the
relative wage costs in 1970 might have looked very different had 1990
relative wage costs been taken into account.

FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (20): Prising open the public sector / A look at
new rules designed to stop governments, local authorities and public
utilities from shutting out foreign suppliers - Procurement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GERMAN company supplies chairs to Danish kindergartens. A French company
provides road sweeping services to English local authorities. A British
manufacturer bids to supply mail sacks to the German Post Office.
Public sector contracts, traditionally closed to foreign suppliers, are
slowly being opened up. A market worth Pounds 500m a year and equivalent to
about 15 per cent of the European Community's gross domestic product is
being weaned off national preferences.
There is still a long way to go. Public officials spending taxpayers' money
have been slow to perceive the benefits of buying in a pan-European market.
But a raft of new EC legislation is helping shift entrenched attitudes.
Six directives have been promulgated over the past five years to open up
public procurement markets. The aim is to ensure that the Single Market
takes effect in the public sector by preventing governments, local
authorities and water, transport and power companies from discriminating
against foreign suppliers.
The cornerstone of the new regime is a requirement that public authorities
publish the details of their larger contracts in the EC's Official Journal
(the S series).* The same information is also available in electronic form
through Tenders Electronic Daily, an EC database.
In 1992 more than 9,200 public sector contracts were awarded, according to
Euro-Bid Watch, a consultancy which analyses the EC's contracts data.
Under EC rules, tender information is to be published in three stages.
Advance warning of forthcoming tenders in what are known as periodic
indicative notices or PINs is followed by details of individual contracts
and finally by an announcement, within 48 days of the event, that a contract
has been awarded.
The new directives call for public authorities to provide sufficient
information for all potential bidders to take part. Purchasers should not
specify the use of a particular trade-marked product to exclude other
bidders and where a European standard exists it must be used.
To avoid placing an unfair burden on purchasers the EC has set minimum
thresholds for the contracts which must be reported and has also drawn up
rules preventing unscrupulous purchasers from artificially splitting
contracts to remain below the thresholds.
A further complication is the existence of three possible procedures for
seeking bids: The 'open procedure', where all interested contractors or
suppliers may bid;
The 'restricted procedure', where only invited suppliers may tender and
The 'negotiated procedure', where the public authority negotiates the terms
of the contract with one or more suppliers.
Once the purchaser has assessed all the bids it must award the contract to
either the lowest bidder or 'the most economically advantageous' tender.
This wording allows purchasers to take into account more subjective criteria
but the factors taken into account must be published.
Nevertheless, purchasers can still bend the rules. Many unsuccessful bidders
will be unwilling to challenge a purchaser's decision for fear of losing all
future business and even when public authorities stick to the rules, the
multiplicity of purchasing organisations may put off all but the most
determined. Also, some public authorities employ cumbersome tendering
procedures which can make preparing bids expensive and time-consuming,
especially for smaller companies.
By the time details of a tender appear in the Official Journal it is often
too late, experienced suppliers warn. Companies must build up good contacts
with potential customers so that they have early warning of likely
contracts. Companies new to this field should build up experience with
public sector organisations in their own country before venturing abroad,
experts suggest. And when companies do consider other EC markets they should
start by focusing on just one or two.

FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (19): Easing the payments headache - Alan Spence
finds that passing the responsibility for collection of payment to a
factoring company is a less tiresome way of calling in debts / Factoring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN SPENCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is nothing like handing over the task of collecting your debts to
someone else. Many exporters agree and using factoring companies is the
solution they have found. 'It has made life bearable,' says Geoff Mason,
managing director of Surrey-based Mason Hydraulics, a company which makes
and exports specialist hydraulic equipment and which uses factoring to
collect payments and fund sales.
In its simplest application, export factoring involves the collection of
debts by a factoring company on behalf of an exporter. The exporter delivers
the goods to its foreign client, but the responsibility for collection of
payment is handed over to the export factor, operating in a correspondent
relationship with an import factor in the buyer's country.
On the due date, the import factor seeks to collect payment and pass it on
to the export factor which, in turn, channels the funds to the exporter,
minus the agreed commission. Should there be a payment delay, the import
factor located in the buyer's own country is well positioned locally to
apply appropriate pressure, especially given its familiarity with local
legal practices.
'There is nothing like having a credit manager located in your buyer's
market,' says David Richardson, marketing manager of International Factors,
a member of the worldwide International Factors Group.
But international factoring has two other applications - providing payment
guarantees (effectively credit insurance) and pre-payment (effectively
export finance). As with simple collection of receivables, the correspondent
relationship between factoring companies is central to the process. The
import factor in the buyer's country assesses and accepts the credit risk -
or not - placing the export factor in a position to effectively provide the
requested services to the exporter.
In the case of Mason Hydraulics, which factors around 90 per cent of its
export turnover through Trade Indemnity Heller Commercial Finance - a member
of the International Heller Overseas organisation - the company has opted
for a comprehensive service: collection, funding and insurance. Mr Mason
says he is 'much more comfortable with professionals collecting our money
instead of ourselves'. Collection times have improved by up to 20 per cent,
he adds.
On the question of pre-payment, which becomes available on evidence of
shipment, the company has an agreement that it can draw up to 75 per cent of
the value of a contract - which can be between Pounds 300 and Pounds 25,000.
'There are times when we draw up to the hilt, but we usually like to think
that there is something left for later,' he says.
By comparison, Autovalet Systems - a London-based manufacturer of garment
dispensing machines - which uses the services of International Factors, uses
the collection service and also the pre-payment facility, in its case up to
80 per cent of the value of invoices.
The company chose to handle its credit insurance separately via NCM Credit
Insurance, Britain's leading export credit insurer.
One criticism sometimes heard of factoring is the cost. This has to be
assessed by exporters in terms of administrative savings in chasing
payments, the perceived risk attached to payments and the advantages of
pre-payment.
Mason Hydraulics pays about 2 per cent of invoice value to cover collections
and insurance. Pre-payment costs are geared to prevailing interest rates.
International Factors' Mr Richardson says that the company's credit
collection and bad debt insurance facilities are charged 'usually towards
the lower end of a 0.75 per cent to 2.5 per cent of turnover range'.
Pre-payment is usually available at base rate plus 3 per cent, calculated
daily.
Factoring has also been traditionally accused, especially in the UK, of
carrying with it a stigma: that the supplier is facing financial
difficulties and therefore needs to resort to the services of professional
debt collectors or that the supplier is sufficiently worried about a buyer's
financial standing to consider it necessary to push for payment via a
factoring company.
Mr Mason sees it the other way around. He points out that for a factoring
company to accept an exporter as a client, the latter must submit to a
thorough examination of its operations - thus a certain kudos is attached to
being accepted by a factoring company.
On the other hand, if a buyer's feathers are ruffled by being factored,
companies which factor most or all of their export receivables can retort
that it is simply company policy to proceed in this manner regardless of a
client's standing or status.
International factoring is now big business. According to Amsterdam-based
Factors Chain International, the world's largest factoring chain, turnover
worldwide amounted to Dollars 14.9bn in 1992, with FCI members accounting
for Dollars 6.6bn. Of the other factoring groups, International Factors
handles the largest volume, followed by Heller Overseas.
It is possible to factor exports to a vast range of countries, but
geographical constraints arise from the fact that the process depends on the
existence of local factoring services. While progress is being made in
Hungary and the Czech and Slovak Republics, for example, eastern Europe as a
whole lacks sufficient local factoring infrastructure to make the technique
a commonly available option. This is true of Latin America - with the
notable exception of Mexico. Moreover, factoring and countries with strict
exchange controls do not generally mix, as local collection procedures could
easily be compromised by government strictures on the release of foreign
exchange.

FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (17): A severe message from Hermes - Moves to
reduce the German insurance agency's deficit will mean difficulties for
smaller companies - Export credit agencies / The user's view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE state export guarantees remain one of the most important tools for
German exporters, new restrictions on credit the former Soviet Union have
curbed access in the past 18 months, and moves to reduce the deficit of the
Hermes insurance agency, which allocates the state guarantees, will increase
coverage prices.
Small and medium-size companies, which form the backbone of Germany's
export-driven industry, stand to lose most from these developments.
Reifenhauser, a family-owned company with 1,000 employees, exports more than
60 per cent of its engineering products and has paid for Hermes export
guarantees for several decades. The company is now feeling the pressure of
the changes in policy. 'We are now experiencing new difficulties but these
are also based on political realities abroad and on the necessity for Hermes
to assess risk realistically,' says Stefan Fabricius, a director at
Reifenhauser.
Reifenhauser belongs to the thousands of west German companies regularly
using Hermes guarantees for their exports. In 1992, Hermes coverage was
increased by 3.7 per cent to cover exports worth DM39.2bn, bringing total
coverage to DM160.9bn for the year or 24 per cent of total German exports.
This increase largely reflects new guarantees given in 1991 to the former
Soviet Union. Since the break-up of the communist block, the volume of
guarantees allocated to exports to eastern Europe and the Middle East has
steadily increased at a cost to developing countries.
But default on payment by companies in the former Soviet republics to German
companies has forced the Hermes agency to review its policies. Government
officials say the agency's total exposure to the ex-Soviet Union amounts to
DM54bn. Russian companies alone account for DM48bn. These figures, however,
include contracts on which payment has not met maturity date. Officials will
not give figures for debt which has not been repaid in time.
Indemnifications worth DM955m given by Hermes to German companies in 1992
are largely responsible for the widening deficit of the agency, which
increased to DM2.3bn last year. As a result, the German government cut
coverage to the former Soviet Union to DM4bn for 1992 and 1993.
This limit has already been reached this year, prompting Hermes to issue
halt the issuing of new guarantees except where this would otherwise lead to
significant job losses in places such as east Germany. Moreover, coverage is
now extended only to companies based in east Germany or manufacturing their
end products in that part of the country.
For Reifenhauser, which has a tradition of supplying the region, these
policies have hampered business at a time when it is already fighting a
domestic recession and the difficulties of maintaining its international
competitiveness.
Many west German companies have denounced the measures. Energy groups say
the move will halt much needed exports for the modernisation of power plants
and mines in the former Soviet republics. They argue that such investments
would secure hard currency for their eastern partners in the long term and
should qualify for state guarantees.
The Mittelstand - medium-sized companies - have also been particularly
angered by the new policies. Reifenhauser says the restrictions favour large
companies which have been able to invest in production plants in eastern
Germany.
'This is often not the case for a smaller company which can no longer now
qualify for the guarantees,' says Mr Fabricius.
Ways have been found round the problem through processes such as complex
barter deals. Reifenhauser now sells its sheet extrusion equipment to a
Russian enterprise manufacturing plastic bags and foils. These are then
bought by another west German company and marketed in Germany. Part of the
receipts from the sales are used to repay Reifenhauser.
Similar barter arrangements have been struck by other Mittelstand in west
Germany as solutions to the new limits. Manufacturers of mining equipment in
the Rhur valley recently formed a consortium led by a German coal importer
to supply Russian mining companies, for example.
Restrictions have also been put on guarantees advanced for exports to
Poland. Local clients now have to be registered with a leading Polish banks
before Hermes guarantees can be extended. While this has not affected
Reifenhauser's business in the country, the company points out that younger
Polish enterprises are finding it hard and expensive to qualify and import
foreign equipment.
Similarly, in Iran clients are required to be accredited with the state bank
before German exporters can apply for Hermes guarantees, a measure
introduced at the end of 1992 after Iran's payment record deteriorated.
Reifenhauser says, however, that Hermes guarantees have been useful in other
areas, especially in India and China in recent years. In China, the company
has paid export insurance to cover three to five years' financing deals.
While Chinese clients previously paid in 30 days, they now have recourse to
longer financing following foreign exchange limitations introduced by the
Chinese government.
But Reifenhauser expects Hermes guarantees to become more expensive soon and
fears the additional financial burden for German exporters who are already
suffering from high production costs.
Plans to include the groupings of countries in risk categories - with higher
premiums charged for those considered less safe - have been under discussion
for some time. At present a fixed rate is charged by Hermes to cover up to
90 per cent of the value of an export contract, regardless of the
destination.
But the introduction of this system, scheduled to take place earlier this
year, has been fiercely opposed by German industry which argues that higher
premiums would hamper local exporters already suffering under recession.

FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (18): A cloud over the 'economic miracle' - Amid
political uncertainty, Poland still owes commercial creditors more than
Dollars 12bn. Peter Mayo Elstob finds that past defaults mean that credit
insurers are treating the country cautiously / Short-term trade credit /
Poland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
POLAND'S past is working against it. In spite of its present performance,
the nation's short-term creditworthiness is suffering because of the massive
defaults of the past and fears about its ability to stay on the rails in the
future.
When Britain's Export Credits Guarantee Department resumed medium-term
insurance cover for exports to Poland in July, the country had been
'off-cover' since it first defaulted on its external debt payments in 1982.
But in addition to its debt to official creditors (which stood at Dollars
33bn until it negotiated a 50 per cent reduction in 1991), Poland still owes
commercial creditors more than Dollars 12bn which, unlike the official debt,
has still not been rescheduled.
Against this background, the resumption of ECGD cover - which is restricted
to the export of capital and semi-capital goods, projects and services - is
perhaps more of a political than a business decision. Like other western
countries, the UK is anxious not to be seen putting obstacles in the way of
Polish reform.
But Poland's political uncertainty (which has increased since the success of
left-wing parties in the September 19 general elections) and doubts about
the sustainability of its 'economic miracle' mean that exporters, banks and
commercial credit insurers remain cautious towards trade finance.
Trade Indemnity, for example offers cover on short-term trade finance with
Poland, but only as part of a wider portfolio of risk, says James Fairrie,
who advises the London-based company on export finance.
NCM Credit Insurance, Britain's leading export credit insurer, which took
over the privatised short-term part of ECGD's operations, offers cover for
Poland but at a 3.5 per cent surcharge over its flat rate premium. This is
high, reflecting NCM's perception of Polish risk (it charges 4.5 per cent
for Lebanon), but NCM points out that the exporter receives pre-credit risk
cover, whereas a confirmed letter of credit (l/c) although cheaper is only
valid against shipment of goods.
An exporter manufacturing, say, turbines built to a particular
specification, may find it worthwhile to make use of the pre-credit cover
provided by NCM or other insurers. If his customer becomes insolvent before
his tailor-made goods can be shipped, he can claim on his policy. If,
however, the goods being exported are more generally saleable, the exporter
may find that an l/c confirmed by a well known London-based bank is a
preferable route. Even if the exporter holds an NCM policy, he will not be
charged the surcharge if he has a confirmed l/c.
UK banks are reluctant to accept l/cs issued by any but a handful of Polish
banks, all state-owned or ex-state-owned. Of the more than 100 Polish banks
which now exist, most have been started up in the past few years as
privately-owned concerns. The bulk concentrate on the domestic market but,
being for the most part small and not sufficiently known to international
banks, they probably could not engage in the financing of foreign trade even
if they wanted to.
In practice, even the specialist banks are prepared to deal with no more
than (and often less than) the dozen or so state-owned banks which resulted
from the hiving-off of the regional branches of the old monolithic national
bank. The only exceptions to this rule are the recently privatised
Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy, which counts the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development among its shareholders, and the soon-to-be
privatised Bank Slaski, in which the EBRD is also expected to seek a stake,
along with a number of Polish and western institutional investors.
Poland's political and economic imponderables and possibly its history of
default are also responsible for a reluctance among most UK banks to hold
Polish trade paper to term.
Much finds its way on to the secondary market, with Bank Handlowy w
Warszawie, the foreign trade bank - an important buyer of this paper - both
from banks and directly from exporters.
A small number of specialist banks, however, including Creditanstalt,
Hungarian International Bank, Morgan Grenfell, Midland Bank's trade finance
unit MidAval, and the London branch of Banque Indosuez, compete with
Handlowy to discount Polish paper, on a non-recourse basis.
Exporters who wish to divest themselves completely of Polish risk may prefer
one of these non-Polish banks, but they may find that the discount is a few
basis points deeper to reflect this.
Steven Harding, Handlowy's assistant general manager in London, concedes
that, in spite of this fairly active market for Polish trade paper, British
exporters remain wary of generating Polish receivables. Harding and other
Handlowy staff have responded by going on the road, visiting more than 30
manufacturers so far this year, mainly in such sectors as chemicals,
pharmaceuticals, and agricultural, mining and printing machinery.
The aim is to put the financial risks of trading with Poland into
perspective and to draw exporters' attention to the protection available.

FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (16): Tehran's delays worries bankers - How can
an exporter check the creditworthiness of a buyer overseas? / A look at the
countries with payments problems - Credit watch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JON MARKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IRAN remains a focus of attention for trade creditors as its payments
problems seem set to drag on into 1994-95. Banks report delays of seven to
nine months on letters of credit (l/cs) drawn on Iranian banks. However, the
pattern is more complex as, for some imports (mainly priority goods),
payments may be roughly on time.
Tehran is now making outstanding payments that were due last December. The
nine-month gap is worrying, bankers say, because it goes over the six-month
limit for arrears set by the Iranian authorities.
Worries are growing that the problem is taking root. In May, Bank Markazi,
the central bank, issue a circular permitting Iranian banks to pay
late-payment interest at margins up to 0.75 per cent over Libor.
The scale of Iran's arrears problem emerged in 1992. Export credit agencies
(ECAs) have started to indemnify exporters but, where possible, (to
Germany's Hermes, for example), Tehran is making repayments before this
becomes necessary. Meanwhile, Iran has negotiated a series of one and
two-year 'deferrals' of trade debt of up to Dollars 5bn with big creditors,
including German, French and Swiss banks, and Japanese trading houses and
has held talks with other creditors including Belgian, Dutch, UK and Italian
banks.
If, as seems increasingly likely, roll-over options reportedly included in
some deferral agreements are taken up, Iran's payment problem will continue
into 1995.
For those concerned at not being paid, some banks are offering to purchase
overdue deferred payment and sight l/cs at discounts of about 75 per cent.
Obtaining new financing is difficult.
KENYA
Kenya has arrears of up to one year. This is reflected in the wider problem
of securing trade finance that affects much of sub-Saharan Africa. Some help
may be obtained from niche players.
The Banque Indosuez group says it will buy overdue debt from
government-related contracts guaranteed by Kenya Commercial Bank at 75-80
per cent of face value. Confirmed l/c terms on all deals are recommended.
LEBANON
Lebanon has secured some of the financing for its reconstruction programme.
The local banking sector's remarkable capacity for survival gives some scope
for trade deals. L/cs can be arranged without undue problems for reputable
buyers through leading banks. British Bank of the Middle East reports a
24-hour turnaround on confirmation.
Securing short-term finance may be costly. The Cardiff-based NCM Credit
Insurance has reduced its premiums for Lebanon, but still charges Pounds
3.50 per Pounds 100 of business insured, limited to 180-day confirmed
irrevocable l/c.
To cut costs, Banque du Liban, the central bank, recently guaranteed an l/c
opened for a Dollars 22.7m contract for telephone repairs by Ericsson. Given
Banque du Liban's backing, the Swedish company decided it did not need
reconfirmation.
INDIA
India is enjoying reduced margins as markets warm to the potential offered
by reform. Leading importer Indian Oil Corporation went from paying 125
basis points on 180-day financing to 100 bp and is now paying around 75 bp,
bankers report.
Competition is tough for Indian export credit business, with British
exporters complaining that, at around 9 per cent, ECGD premiums are
uncompetitive. Financing through Italy's SACE is in vogue and the
Export-Import Bank of the US is said to be aggressive on Indian deals.
SLOVENIA
Slovenia is establishing itself as forfaiters become active with deals up to
five years. L/cs backed by the long-established Ljubljanska Banka are
attractive.
The country's first syndicated loan provided Dollars 100m over three years
at margins of 2 3/8 per cent plus fees. The margin was high, a banker says,
'because for all its attraction, Slovenia is next to Croatia'. But a further
loan is expected which will bring pricing much lower and this will feed into
the price paid for refinancing trade debt.
CENTRAL ASIA
The region of Central Asia is trying to build national economies, but has
yet to establish itself as a trade finance market to allow normal trade
flows.
Uzbekistan has led the way to the international capital markets, with a
Dollars 90m syndicated loan to finance its Murantau gold project. Of this,
at least Dollars 35m comes from commercial banks and the rest from the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).
The commercial portion was heavily over-subscribed but unfortunately
Murantau is no benchmark for future trade payments: the EBRD's participation
in the A-loan/B-loan structure and the unusual attractions of the project,
with its assured revenue stream from gold ore reprocessed by US company
Newmont Mining Corporation, make it a one-off.
Kazakhstan is most ready for short-term deals. Banks say they will refinance
up to 180-day l/cs carrying the guarantee of Alembank, formerly the local
branch of Vneshekonombank. Some ECAs, including the UK's Export Credits
Guarantee Department (ECGD), may soon provide limited medium-term cover.

FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (15): Takeovers behind a success - Tony Jackson
finds that an appetite for acquisitions is behind the rise of this company /
Profile of BTR
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The spectacular rise of the industrial conglomerate BTR in the export
rankings is a tribute less to its salesmanship than to its appetite for
acquisitions. At the end of 1991, BTR swallowed one of the grand old names
of British engineering, Hawker Siddeley, in a bitterly contested takeover
battle.
Though much smaller than BTR, Hawker had exports of comparable size - well
over Pounds 300m in its last year of independence. These were broadly
spread, from electrical switchgear from its Brush factory in Loughborough to
electric motors, aerospace components and diesel engines.
The acquisition shot BTR from 26th to 16th in the rankings last year, and
more than doubled its exports to Pounds 753m. But BTR is a formidable
exporter on its own account. Its Dunlop International Technology subsidiary
 -the product of another bitter takeover battle in 1985 - won the Queen's
Award for exports last year. Among other BTR companies, DCE exports over 80
per cent of its dust control equipment and International Radiator Services
exports over a third of its radiators and cores to mainland Europe.
In spite of that, exporting is not an activity readily associated with BTR,
simply because its operations are so widely spread around the world. Even
after the Hawker acquisition, only Pounds 1.4bn of the group's Pounds 5.4bn
of operating assets - 26 per cent of the total - were located in the UK.
This was a lower figure than the Americas, with Pounds 1.5bn, and not much
bigger than Australasia, where BTR has built up a powerful presence through
its Nylex subsidiary.
The company is now at a delicate stage in its development. Its founding
genius, Sir Owen Green, retired this year and, in a development which
surprised many outsiders, he was succeeded not by the Australian managing
director Alan Jackson, nor by the American chief operating office Robert
Faircloth, but by Norman Ireland, the former finance director and the man
credited with putting in place the financial controls which form the
backbone of BTR's management method.
Mr Ireland had retired from active service with BTR three years earlier,
turning instead to a highly successful stint as chairman of the packaging
group Bowater. His return to BTR looks like a temporary solution, the
implication being that the company has yet to solve the all-important
question of how the first generation of management establishes the
succession.
BTR may be at a crossroads in a wider strategic sense. Under Sir Owen, it
was an unrepentant conglomerate, at a time when the concept was rapidly
drifting out of fashion. In the past few years, it has become received
wisdom in the developed world that conglomerates belong to an early stage of
industrial development. They may still work for Korea or Malaysia. But in
the US or Europe, the fashion is for focus and specialisation. Hence, for
instance, last year's break-up of ICI.
At the same time, contested takeovers are becoming rarer. In the low-growth
environment of the early 1990s, it is widely felt that the risks involved in
a hostile bid no longer make sense. As a conglomerate built on takeovers,
BTR is thus doubly unfashionable.
In spite of that, it looks like a survivor. Although its products range from
gravel and glass bottles to aircraft wheels and golf clubs, it can claim a
focus of its own: as a specialist in industrial management, manufacturing
low or medium technology products to a high level of efficiency. Until it
settles on a new direction, it can afford to bide its time.

FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (14): Trade balance strengthens - The British
powerhouse's success is based on its ability to discover, develop and then
market highly innovative medicines. Paul Abrahams finds that export growth
has risen again this year / The pharmaceuticals industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK's pharmaceuticals industry is one of nation's crown jewels, second
only to power-generating machinery in its trade balance surplus.
Last year, the sector enjoyed a surplus of Pounds 1.329bn, more even than
the petroleum industry. In 1951, the trade surplus was only Pounds 31m.
The continuing trade balance success of the UK's drugs industry has been
based on export growth, which has risen steadily over the past decade,
increasing from Pounds 978m in 1982 to Pounds 2.993bn last year.
The leading exporter is Zeneca, the recently spun-off bioscience business of
Imperial Chemical Industries. Although this is not the largest of the UK's
bioscience companies, a substantial proportion of its manufacturing is
carried out in the UK.
Last year, the company, which sells agrochemicals and speciality chemicals
as well as medicines, generated exports of Pounds 1.4bn compared with Pounds
1.23bn the previous year.
Other leading exporters include Glaxo, Europe's largest pharmaceuticals
group, whose exports rose only 0.84 per cent from Pounds 837m in 1991 to
Pounds 844m last year as it brought overseas manufacturing of its new
products on stream.
SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American healthcare group, increased its
exports by 33 per cent from Pounds 347m in 1991 to Pounds 462m last year.
The company says this was because of the launch of its anti-depressant
Seroxat and the anti-nausea product Kytril.
The UK's pharmaceuticals export success has been generated not only by
UK-based groups but by also by highly successful British subsidiaries of
multinational corporations.
Ciba, the Swiss group, runs a large UK trade surplus with exports last year
of Pounds 294m and imports of only Pounds 79m, although not all of this is
generated by pharmaceuticals. The company is the UK's 41st largest exporter.
Another Swiss company, Roche, also runs a trade surplus with exports of
Pounds 112m compared with imports of Pounds 67m. Lilly Industries, the UK
subsidiary of Eli Lilly of the US is the UK's 78th biggest exporter, with
sales overseas of Pounds 132m compared with imports of Pounds 79m.
The basis of the UK's success has been its remarkable ability to discover,
develop and then market highly innovative medicines.
According to the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, UK
groups have successfully developed 420 new chemical entities.
Two of the world's 10 top-selling drugs were developed in the UK, including
Glaxo's Zantac, the world's best-selling medicine with sales of more than
Pounds 2.1bn a year.
However, the rate of import growth is rising more rapidly than export
growth. Whereas exports exceeded imports by a factor of four in 1970, the
ratio by last year was only 1.5. Imports increased from Pounds 375m in 1982,
to Pounds 1.663bn last year. The UK runs drugs trade deficits with Germany,
Switzerland, and Sweden, for example.
The position would be worse if the UK domestic market was not so small. Its
per capita consumption of medicines was only Dollars 46 during the first six
months of the year, according to IMS, the specialist market research
company. The figure in France was double that.
One reason for the increasing penetration of non-UK medicines is that
British doctors are prescribing increasing numbers of drugs from overseas.
According to SmithKline Beecham, the third, fourth and fifth largest drugs
groups selling in the UK are Ciba, Astra of Sweden and Bayer of Germany.
Merck &amp; Co of the US and Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the Franco-American group, are
seventh and eighth.
In addition, many British groups are investing in manufacturing overseas. Dr
Joe Blaker, group technical director in charge of manufacturing at Glaxo,
estimates that 10 years ago its US market was almost entirely supplied by
products originating from the UK. The company now manufactures more than
half its volume outside its home-country.
Other groups are following Glaxo's lead. SmithKline Beecham has
manufacturing sites in Puerto Rico, Singapore, Ireland and the UK.
The first three countries have all offered significant tax breaks for
pharmaceuticals manufacturing. Wellcome estimates that 65 per cent of its
active ingredients are manufactured in Britain, but only 40 per cent of its
products are finished there.
While British-based groups seem set to discover innovative products, the UK
will not entirely benefit from their success.

FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (13): Taking a longer view - Andrew Baxter finds
that performances vary but the overall picture for the sector is good / The
engineering industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR UK-based engineering companies exporting to world markets, the ability
to make good, competitively priced products seems to be half the battle. On
top of that comes perseverance and the ability to take a long-term view.
The nine general engineering companies in the Top 100 cover products ranging
from ropes to pumps and food manufacturing equipment, with household names
such as APV, Weir and Vosper Thornycroft rubbing shoulders with less-well
known companies such as Northern Ireland-based FG Wilson Engineering.
Compared with their exports in 1991, the companies' performance varied quite
widely last year, with advances leading declines by six to three. But
overall they managed to boost exports by 15.6 per cent to Pounds 1.348bn.
This is a creditable performance given the depressed state of many world
markets for engineered products.
The biggest exporter is Vickers, producer of tanks, Rolls-Royce cars,
bearings and medical equipment. It lifted total exports by 35.1 per cent
last year to Pounds 250.4m, according to the top 100 figures.
But the biggest rise in exports was notched up by a foreign company,
German-owned Robert Bosch. The vehicle components group more than doubled
its exports from Pounds 45.8m in 1991 to Pounds 93.5m last year.
The achievement is a direct result of Bosch' decision to manufacture compact
alternators at a plant at Miskin, South Glamorgan. Production began only in
January 1991 and it is projected that the factory will reach full output by
the mid-1990s.
The factory was always intended to be Bosch' single European source of
supply for compact alternators, which are lighter and more powerful than
conventional units.
Almost all last year's exports went to continental Europe, but the factory
is also selling to vehicle manufacturers in Japan.
In the post-cold war era of defence cuts, another creditable export
achievement was recorded at Vosper Thornycroft, the Southampton-based naval
shipbuilder. Exports rose by 46.9 per cent to Pounds 147.3m, with
performance boosted by two substantial orders from the Royal Navy of Oman,
for two corvettes, and the Qatar Navy for four fast strike craft.
Martin Jay, group managing director, says that the order book is standing at
a record level of Pounds 700m, of which about 95 per cent is accounted for
by the company's exports.
But he stresses that last year's successes were no flash in the pan: 'During
the last 30 years we have exported to 30 navies around the world. We have
the great benefit of selling to existing satisfied customers.'
He expresses confidence about winning further export orders. 'We are
certainly very buoyant,' he adds.
FG Wilson, meanwhile, raised its exports by 43.3 per cent to Pounds 117.4m.
The company produces diesel electric generating sets used in applications
such as stand-by power for hospitals or shopping centres, and did
particularly well last year in the Middle East and Australasia.
Last month it won the Electrical Review's export award, sponsored by GEC
Alsthom, in recognition of export sales which have grown by an average 39
per cent a year since 1987. Apart from having a product that is now
recognised worldwide, the privately-owned company's export expansion has
also been helped by being patient.
Its US subsidiary took two years to break even, and its French distributor
has yet to make a profit, but Wilson considers its presence in France to be
'absolutely critical' to its growth plans, according to the award citation.
The company has also made agreements with a number of companies which export
its gensets, including Ingersoll-Rand, Massey Ferguson and Caterpillar, to
penetrate new export markets.
The privately-owned FG Wilson employs 1,000 people, with 700 workers in
Larne. The company recently moved into an old GEC factory there,
consolidating manufacturing which used to take place at five separate
facilities.

FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (12): Falling output lies ahead - The sector's
outlook is being coloured by a drop in new car sales in continental Europe /
The motor industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE

<TEXT>
UK CAR production for export markets has proved surprisingly resilient
during the first eight months of 1993, but the industry fears a steep fall
in output in the final months of the year. Several of the carmakers
operating in the UK are being forced to reduce production in response to the
continuing sharp fall in new car sales in continental Europe.
Car output for export markets in the first eight months of the year at
347,479 was 4.8 per cent higher than in the same period a year ago, as
rising output from the three Japanese carmakers, Nissan, Toyota and Honda
offset lower production from Ford, Vauxhall and Peugeot.
Nissan too is being forced to reduce production sharply in November and
December, however, as its reacts to the weakness of continental European
demand. It exports around 80 per cent of the output of its Pounds 900m
Sunderland car plant.
'It now appears likely that following a number of production cutbacks the
British-based industry will this year produce no more than it did in 1992,'
Geoffrey Whalen, president of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders, warned recently. The benefit of higher car sales in the UK was
being neutralised by the fall in exports to continental Europe.
Car production still outperformed many other sectors of manufacturing during
the UK recession, however, as exports compensated for the sharp fall in
domestic sales. UK car output in 1992 at 1.29m was less than 1 per cent
below the 1.3m level of 1989, despite the 31 per cent fall in UK new car
sales in the same period. Car output for export markets accounted for 45.6
per cent of total UK car production in 1992 and for 48.9 per cent in 1991
compared with only 21.6 per cent in 1989.
In the longer-term exports are again expected to be the force behind rising
UK car output in the second half of the 1990s, as production builds up at
car plants being developed by Toyota and Honda.
Ford and General Motors (Vauxhall), the US carmakers, have both integrated
their UK assembly plants into their European production networks. Both had
started to export a significant share of their UK car output, until the
recession in continental Europe forced them to apply the brakes to the
export effort this year.
Rover Group, the motor vehicles subsidiary of British Aerospace, is bucking
the trend. It is performing well in continental European markets despite the
steep decline in overall European new car sales.
In the first six months of the year Rover and Land Rover worldwide vehicle
sales increased by 13 per cent to 202,100. Rover is starting to reap the
benefits of a concentrated effort to build up its dealer networks in France,
Germany and Italy, and it is enjoying particular success with its Land Rover
Discovery four-wheel drive leisure/utility vehicle.
But for now the overall outlook for UK production and exports is being
coloured by the sharp downturn in new car sales in continental Europe. In
the first eight months of the year sales were 16 per cent lower than in the
same period a year earlier.

FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (10): Cross-border trade quickens - David
Dodwell finds there is a growing concentration of export activity in British
industry and a strong foreign presence, according to the Financial Times'
latest survey of leading UK exporters / Comment

A TOTAL of 41 of the UK's Top 100 exporters are foreign owned, with 26
belonging to US parents, according to the Financial Times' latest survey of
leading exporters.
The survey also points to an increasing concentration of exporting activity
in UK industry, with the Top 100 accounting for about 47 per cent of all
exports in 1992 - up from 43 per cent in 1991. It is perhaps no accident
that the British government has campaigned hard this year to draw more small
and medium-sized companies into cross border trade.
While British Aerospace lengthened its lead as the country's leading
exporter, the main shake-up last year in the top 10 resulted from ICI hiving
off Zeneca, its former bioscience subsidiary. This led to ICI slipping from
second to seventh place. But at the same time, Zeneca entered the Top 100
for the first time in 10th place.
BP jumped from fourth to second place, on the back of a 52 per cent rise in
exports, while a 21 per cent jump by Shell lifted it into third place. Ford
slipped down to fourth position after its exports slumped by 19 per cent.
It is notable that the top 10 accounted for exports worth Pounds 25.4bn, or
more than 23 per cent of the UK's total Pounds 108.3bn exports in 1992.
More than seven out of every 10 exporters saw an improvement in exports.
This was a sharp improvement from 1991, when seven of the top 10 reported a
fall in overseas sales, and illustrates the early signs of British
industry's emergence from recession.
The performance was largely unaffected by sterling's devaluation against
most European currencies in September last year. The effects of devaluation
will only have become apparent during 1993.
For those in the UK who share US President Clinton's concern over 'jobless
growth', the survey shows that job losses continued even as exports
recovered. A surprising 79 of the Top 100 exporters cut their workforce last
year.
Only two companies added significantly to their labour force: BTR did so
because of its takeover of Hawker Siddeley late in 1991, and Nissan also
created more jobs as it moved to full production at its new car plant in
Swindon.
After entering the Top 100 in 14th place in 1991, Nissan edged up to 13th
place in 1992, hoisting exports by 33.7 per cent to Pounds 911m. Vauxhall,
which also leapt into the Top 100 in 16th place for the first time in 1991,
edged up one place on the back of a more modest 21.6 per cent gain to Pounds
754m.
While Nissan can expect to announce further gains for 1993 as its Swindon
plant has come into full production, Vauxhall is unlikely to have maintained
its growth, as Europe's car market has floundered this year.
Another insight arising from the data is that Vauxhall imports significantly
more into the UK than it exports. In spite of being the country's 15th most
important exporter in gross terms, it is in net terms a massive importer.
Imports amounting to almost Pounds 1.5bn in cars and components make it a
net importer to the tune of Pounds 736m.
Vauxhall is far from alone in this. Many companies fail to provide relevant
data, but among those that do, British Steel's imports of Pounds 790m
trimmed its net exports to Pounds 649m, while Unilever's Pounds 834m import
bill makes it a net importer of goods worth Pounds 177m, and Conoco becomes
a net importer of goods worth Pounds 311m after imports of Pounds 736m are
deducted from its exports.
Significant increases in exports were recorded by Esso (up 23 per cent),
SmithKline Beecham (33 per cent), Compaq (28 per cent), Thorn EMI (30 per
cent), and Vickers (35 per cent).
Four companies leapt into the Top 100 for the first time: Jaguar, revealing
separate figures for the first time, entered in 23rd position with exports
of Pounds 506m; FG Wilson, the Northern Ireland-based general engineering
group, was lifted to 83nd position by its 43 per cent jump in exports to
Pounds 117m; Amerada Hess, the US controlled oils group, more than doubled
exports to Pounds 97m to enter in 94rd position; and Robert Bosch, the
German engineer squeezed into 98th position after doubling exports to Pounds
93m.
The main casualties between 1991 and 1992 were the conglomerate Trafalgar
House, whose 19.5 per cent export decline to Pounds 640m pushed it from 12th
to 20th position; Inco, the Canadian-owned metals group which slipped 17
places to 39th after exports fell 21 per cent to Pounds 318m; British
Nuclear Fuels, which tumbled 28 places to 66th after exports fell 30 per
cent to Pounds 186m; and the aerospace group Westland, which fell 25 places
to 77th as exports slipped by Pounds 35 per cent to Pounds 139m.
There were few clear sectoral trends. Food manufacturers, brewers and health
and household groups were the most consistent in reporting a rise in exports
between 1991 and 1992, but only SmithKline Beecham and Nestle saw strong
gains (They were up 33 per cent and 18 per cent respectively).
The building materials sector, which included Pilkington, saw consistent
falls in exports, while those companies defined by the Financial Times as
conglomerates - Tenneco, Hanson, and Trafalgar House - also suffered, though
not for any apparently linked reason.
In spite of their leading role as exporters, only a minority of the Top 100
were heavily dependent on exports. Just 36 exported more than half of their
turnover, while only 14 exported more than three quarters.
Most export dependent were FG Wilson (exporting 90 per cent); Caterpillar
(88 per cent); Nissan (86 per cent); Zeneca (82 per cent); and Polaroid (81
per cent).

FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (9): Virtue of patience / A look at the approach
taken by the export sales manager of Railweight, a maker of high-tech
weighing equipment - Company profile of Gabriel Villalon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Born in Chile and a graduate of Wharton School of Business in Philadelphia,
Gabriel Villalon has worked as a specialist in risk management in
international markets and spent several years in the aluminium industry. He
has also worked in Spain.
He was headhunted by Chronos Richardson last year with a brief to improve
its export performance. Home markets had declined and the company had become
part of Staveley Industries - which also owns the well-known Salter scales
brand name - in 1990.
The company is in the high technology end of the weighing business. It sells
a system developed by Coventry University - the former Lanchester
Polytechnic - to weigh railway wagons while they are moving at speeds of up
to 70 kph. This year it has started trading as Railweight to define its
image better in its highly specialised marketplace.
In the past rail wagons had to be weighed individually while at a
standstill. This meant that trains had to be uncoupled which involved
sometimes complicated shunting operations and a great deal of time and
manpower.
Over the past quarter century, the industry worldwide has moved to devices
to save uncoupling, although most still require wagons to be at rest, thus
requiring a time and energy-consuming series of stops and starts.
Mr Villalon sells devices which measure the sheer stress produced by each
wheel of a wagon as it passes over them. A series of transducers, linked to
computers, are part of integrated system which calculates the weight of each
wagon to within acceptable ranges of accuracy for the value of the load
carried.
The main customers are railway operators and any industry shifting bulk
materials - coal, cement, steel, petro-chemicals, port operations, ores,
minerals - by train.
This means export markets have become increasingly important as the British
coal industry - a principal customer and mainstay of Railweight's domestic
markets - has declined. This pressure has also encouraged lateral thinking
about other applications: the systems involved can be used equally
successfully to exactly weigh - and quickly - the precursors and raw
materials that go into chemicals manufacture or blending operations.
Moreover, by putting a transponder in every railway wagon to identify it
electronically, every location and use of each wagon can be monitored and
managed more effectively, enabling assets to be driven harder.
Maintenance is also more easily controlled - the system can detect when the
amplitude of a signal from a railway wheel changes as it wears, so it can be
replaced before it causes the train to stop. This is an improvement on
former systems, when railway workers with a good ear went round sidings and
marshalling yards tapping wheels to find faulty ones through the note they
sounded.
Railweight now turns over Pounds 2m, 60 per cent of which is exported.
Margins are comfortable because the business operates with only 20 people in
Stockport, near Manchester Airport, outsourcing most of the materials and
components from which each individual weighing system is assembled.
'No sale is straightforward,' Mr Villalon says, 'We don't just turn up with
a box of tricks. We offer to solve problems, reduce costs and improve
efficiency.'
Mr Villalon says his market is a global one, involving any company or
nationalised industry which moves goods by rail. His general approach to
exporting is to start by identifying exactly whom he should sell to. 'I work
in close contact with embassies, consulates and the Department of Trade and
Industry to get the information we need on potential customers, agents and
so on. The next thing is to go and visit,' he says.
Mr Villalon favours chamber of commerce missions for the initial
reconnaissance. These are subsidised by the government and this helps keeps
costs down. Obligations are not onerous: a few official functions and a
compulsory debriefing so the DTI can account for its spending, but most of
the time Mr Villalon is available for visits.
Mr Villalon also finds it useful to use the British Embassy for
presentations to groups, who can see videos and displays that would be
difficult to travel with. 'When I know who I want to see, I then go back to
see them individually in their place of work.' This usually means a
follow-up trip to the country concerned.
'This is a business where results are hard to come by. I am going to Spain
soon, hopefully to clinch a deal it has taken 11 months to do. I am pursuing
another sale in Poland with a liquid petroleum gas company that we started
work on in July last year. You have to be patient and keep at it,' Mr
Villalon says.
It also helps to speak to customers in their own language. Mr Villalon says
many people do not pay enough attention to this. His origins in South
America give him a decided advantage: he is fluent in Spanish, Portuguese,
English, French and Italian and says he can 'get by' in German. A former
marriage to a Swede also gave him Swedish.

FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (8): Checking out the buyers - Paul Melly
examines the ways in which the creditworthiness of potential customers can
be verified / Credit risk assessment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL MELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN a company's home market is in recession, attempts to increase business
through exports can become an increasingly important part of sales strategy.
But while winning foreign orders is one thing, getting paid is another.
Exporters need a way of tackling commercial payment risks in markets such as
Europe and the United States, where political risk is not an issue,
especially today with these markets in recession. The problem is compounded
by the increased tendency towards open account trading, particularly between
European buyers and sellers - that is, trading without the payment security
associated with letters of credit which involve various levels of bank
protection.
One solution is to seek the protection of a credit insurance policy. In the
UK these are issued chiefly by London-based Trade Indemnity and
Cardiff-based, but Dutch-owned NCM, formerly the short-term insurance
division of the UK's Export Credits Guarantee Department. Protection can
also be sought through such specialist activities as factoring, where a
third party can take over the responsibility for collecting and, where
required, guaranteeing a substantial portion of due payments.
However, the issue of payments security can also be addressed by exporters
themselves by more closely examining the risks associated with selling to a
specific client, especially where new business is concerned.
In addition to a dedicated in-house individual or team, such an approach
requires accurate information about the buyers. Exporters need to decide at
what point such an approach makes economic sense.
It is not easy to obtain accurate information on the recent financial
performance of buyers in many parts of the world, either because the data is
not published or because no central collection point, such as Companies
House in the UK, exists. This applies not only to developing countries, but
also to many newly-industrialised markets, such as Hong Kong or Saudi
Arabia, and to some of the most powerful industrial economies in the west.
In Germany, medium-sized family firms - the Mittelstand - account for an
important slice of the market yet most are privately owned and do not have
to release the detailed financial results that publicly quoted firms in
Britain disclose. Only 11,000 companies in Germany are legally obliged to
file accounts, compared with 900,000 in the UK, and a fine of just Dollars
30 puts little pressure on them to do so.
In France, company accounts are lodged at local chambers of commerce, rather
than a national centre. Finding out which chamber holds a buyer's accounts
can be time-consuming and, in any case, annual accounts give only a limited
picture of a buyer's creditworthiness and reliability.
Such problems can, however, be largely overcome by using the services of
credit reporting agencies. These systematically collect published financial
information and catalogue it on computerised databases. The published
accounts are supplemented with a mountain of detailed practical information
on trading and payment performance from a wide range of sources.
Agencies such as Graydon (owned by leading credit insurance groups NCM,
Hermes and Coface), CCN, Infocheck and Dun &amp; Bradstreet charge between
Pounds 20 and Pounds 100 for a detailed report on a company in Europe or
North America, depending on the amount of detail required and the country
concerned.
At a time of economic uncertainty, exporters often need to monitor their
main customers continuously to avoid the risk of not being paid for goods
supplied or of receiving the money late. Another danger is a slump in orders
as financial problems force a buyer to cut back on new purchases.
Big credit reporting agencies, for a fee of only a few pounds, will monitor
the status of a foreign buyer and warn the exporter of any financial
problems.
Europe's leading credit insurers are developing a rival Europe-wide service,
Eurogate, which aims to provide reports on buyers in all 12 EC countries in
a standardised format. In their original form, company accounts are hard to
compare, as accounting requirements vary from country to country. But the
Eurogate service aims to ensure that all buyers are assessed using the same
criteria.
The drive behind the creation of Eurogate late last year, came from NCM,
Hermes and Coface, three of the biggest credit insurers. They wanted to
ensure universally high standards of data collection because they draw on
credit reports for their own assessment of buyers.
Founder reporting agencies in Eurogate included reporting agency Graydon (in
Britain, the Netherlands and Belgium), France's SCRL, and Burgel Wirtschaft
Information in Germany. But the network is being extended to include members
in Austria, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland.
However, Eurogate members will have a tough fight matching the competitive
strength of Dun &amp; Bradstreet, which has data on 10.5m European companies on
file. It already has a system for presenting reports in a standard format,
with standard principles for assessing creditworthiness. Dun &amp; Bradstreet
provides detailed analysis of payment delays and defaults.
Reports can be translated into half a dozen languages. Customers can pick
out the various bits of information that they need, rather than taking the
whole report.
Leading agencies such as Dun &amp; Bradstreet are able to offer an on-line
service providing exporters with data through a direct electronic link to
their offices. Graydon, through Eurogate, is now developing this service:
information from the Netherlands, Belgium and France is already on line;
Spain and Portugal will follow at the end of October, and Italy and
Switzerland at the end of November.
But agency information, however detailed, is no guarantee of future payment.
Even if a report is favourable, an exporter may still decide to take out
credit insurance cover, or insist on secure trade financing terms - such as
a confirmed irrevocable letter of credit.

FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (7): Problems, but full of promise - Jon Marks
finds the countries of North Africa hold rewards for those prepared to face
the difficulties of doing business with them / The Maghreb region

'I COULD sign up so many contracts this week,' the finance director of a
leading exporting company said during a recent visit to Algeria. 'It's just
that I can't find the way to finance them.'
Traditionally, multinationals used subsidiaries in France, Italy and other
leading trading partners to tap the high levels of trade finance and export
credit agency (ECA) cover available for Algeria. Now, concern over the scale
of debt repayments, estimated at more than Dollars 9bn in 1993, has led many
ECAs to reduce their cover.
This has deprived Algiers of the medium-term credit which was for years the
lifeblood of its business.
'Foreign loans are only available short-term - and then if we pay a
sweetener - from banks who still say they believe in our future,' says Mr
Abdelkader Belgherbi, a vice-governor of the central bank, Banque d'Algerie.
'This is a problem for an economy which depended on credit for 20 years.'
Algeria has never rescheduled its debt - although that is now an option -
and maintains a good repayments record.
Exporters are suffering from the credit crunch. Some, such as Italian grain
producers (with annual exports of Dollars 400m) and steel companies have
lobbied governments to increase support. They are opposed by treasuries,
concerned at the high levels of risk involved.
Algeria is the single largest risk for the Italian ECA, Sezione Speciale per
Assicuzione del Credito all'Esportazione (SACE), whose total exposure is
about Dollars 6.5bn. Trade credits guaranteed by the Coface, French ECA, are
also about Dollars 6bn.
Exporters are having to secure financing by whatever route possible. With
France limiting itself to a credit package of Fr6bn this year and Italy
imposing new limits, companies are looking farther and wider for support.
The rewards can be great. Big ticket contracts, especially for hydrocarbons
schemes such as the estimated Dollars 2bn Maghreb-Europe gas pipeline, will
continue to attract companies to Algeria. But the country's potential will
remain unfulfilled while the credit crunch prevails.
This process is working in reverse elsewhere in the region comprising Egypt
and the five Arab Maghreb Union (UMA) members - Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia,
Libya and Mauritania. Other markets are gaining from improved credit
ratings.
After the Gulf war of 1991, Egypt's debt programme, new credits and slow
moves towards liberalisation have yielded dividends. A Dollars 2bn-plus
current account surplus is forecast for 1993 and foreign exchange reserves
stand at Dollars 16bn. Exporters to Egypt report that local banks, led by
National Bank of Egypt (NBE), are using reserves to finance trade deals at
advantageous rates.
Morocco has seen ECA cover restored after the debt crisis of the 1980s.
Italy, Belgium and the UK are among those using credit support to challenge
France and Spain in one of their leading markets. In 1992, Morocco replaced
Algeria as France's largest export market in the Maghreb region.
As the region struggles with the populist challenge of radical Islam and
rapidly rising populations (with Tunisia at under 2 per cent an exception),
North Africa is not an easy region with which to do business. But an
increasing number of analysts believe the region offers a new emerging
market opportunity. They are looking towards Morocco, Tunisia and, to a
lesser extent, Egypt.
To others, it is a region in political turmoil where nation states have yet
to come to terms with the challenge of radical Islam, a demographic time
bomb or the need for solid institutions. Their worries centre on
developments in Algeria, Libya and (also) Egypt.
Arab North Africa offers trading partners a rich but frustrating blend of
promise and problems. The EC has understood this, and will this autumn begin
formal negotiations with Tunisia and Morocco to establish innovative free
trade zones.
Once concluded, these agreements linking North African states more closely
to the European economy should substantially increase business opportunities
 -on both flanks of the Mediterranean.
Algeria is hungry for credit which cannot be supplied. To maintain debt
repayments estimated at Dollars 9.1bn in 1993, when exports will not exceed
Dollars 12bn, imports need to be held down. Reserves (minus gold stocks) had
to be built to around Dollars 2bn by mid-1993, in spite of payments
pressures.
However, the market needs large-scale imports to stimulate higher industrial
output or productive private enterprise. Algiers may now reschedule after
years of resistance to such a strategy. The hydrocarbons sector will remain
the focus of business activity.
Egypt, the region's most populous country (59m), has gained from its 1991
debt accord with sovereign lenders to tie debt relief to progress on
economic reforms, with a current account surplus capable of weathering the
downturn in tourism and a build-up of foreign reserves giving increased
scope for financing contracts.
NBE now says it could finance larger schemes from its own resources. Private
sector banks are emerging, notably Commercial International Bank, which is
favoured by trade financiers.
Reform has moved slowly, but privatisation is under way and full currency
convertibility is expected. Substantial bilateral credits (especially from
the US, France and Arab funds) and multilateral credits for projects
(notably the power sector) are features of the market.
Morocco is fast gaining support for the view that it can emerge as a
Mediterranean investment and manufacturing centre. The dirham has been made
convertible for current account transactions. An accelerating privatisation
policy is stimulating new investment and interest from fund managers. In
1992, foreign investment (at Dollars 514m) for the first time exceeded the
current account deficit.
Trade flows have come under pressure from drought and a weak international
phosphate market. Imports and exports are down in 1993. Drought meant that
GDP fell by 2.9 per cent in 1992. But Morocco has emerged stronger from a
decade of structural adjustment, and growth is reported in most sectors.
Manufacturing exports are forecast to grow by 10 per cent in 1994. Reserves
remain more than Dollars 3.5bn, sufficient to cover six months of imports.
All leading ECAs now provide cover, although many have ceilings in place.
Soft credits are often needed to secure larger orders.
Tunisia is the country where everyone wants to do more business. Bankers and
companies visit, admire the economy's positive points and creditworthiness -
and then often leave empty-handed. All ECAs are fully on-cover.
The government's strategy is based on investment-led growth, especially in
technology-related industries. This is to maintain growth rates which rose
to 8.6 per cent in 1992 and for Tunis to become 'the Singapore of the
Mediterranean'. Growth is forecast at around 3 per cent in 1993. Inflation
fell to 5.5 per cent in 1992, and birth rates are low. But the population
(8.5m people) is too small to provide an important consumer market.
Imports rose to a new high in 1992, but were less than Dollars 6bn. A few
big industrial projects are under way, notably British Gas' Dollars 620m
Miskar gasfield project.
Tunisia is seen as a rare successful graduate of structural adjustment in
Africa. In January the government introduced current account convertibility
for imports andexports, leading to an unusual outburst from the visiting IMF
managing-director Michel Camdessus who described it as 'the most beautiful
present I have ever been given'.
Mauritania is the smallest, most aid-dependent UMA market. Merchandise
exports in 1991 were Dollars 230m and imports Dollars 211m. In December
1992, the IMF concluded a two-year enhanced structural adjustment facility.
France dominates a market which has suffered recession in fishing and its
few other industries.
Libya is affected by sanctions, imposed as a consequence of the Lockerbie
affair. Payments arrears can be endemic for all but priority projects. But
the market continues to attract exporters in line with Libya's status as an
Opec oil producer with a relatively small population (around 5m) and high
imports (around Dollars 8bn). Libya remains the UK's largest UMA market,
with exports worth Pounds 228m in 1992. Annual oil exports are Dollars 9 to
Dollars 10bn.
Tightening sanctions to include hydrocarbons and financial reserves would
hurt. Libya is estimated to hold up to Dollars 17bn in liquid foreign assets
and some Dollars 4bn fixed assets. Payments can be a problem. Contractors,
including German and South Korean companies, often use long-term letters of
credit to finance deals.

FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (6): Finding a way into difficult markets - By
relieving the supplier of the risk and taking the debt off the
manufacturer's hands, this form of financing provides a solution to an
exporting problem in heavily indebted countries / Forfaiting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IT IS nothing new to exporters that some of the most heavily indebted
developing countries of the 1980s are now begining to re-emerge as private
sector-driven markets in the 1990s.
Latin America is back as a market for capital goods. New markets are
emerging in Asia and elsewhere with a hunger for equipment - and the
financing needed to pay for it.
The problem is how to exploit new opportunities when the financing capacity
of banks and credit insurers is often low and few companies can afford to
take big financial risks or tie up their cash flow. Forfaiting may offer a
solution.
The risk/cashflow problem was confronted directly by a UK-based manufacturer
of aviation equipment which in the early 1990s secured an estimated Dollars
13m contract to provide capital goods to the Brazilian navy. For two years,
the order was stalled due to lack of financing. The buyer was unable to
provide the five-year credit terms required by the purchaser.
The supplier, who did not want to be identified, found the solution in a
specialist forfaiter who could provide credit for the buyer and ease the
manufacturer's cashflow by taking the debt off its hands.
Forfaiting gives the exporter 'non-recourse' financing, taking the risk off
the supplier's hands by buying the exporter's debt at a discount. The
exporter therefore receives cash up-front. The forfaiter often then sells-on
all or part of this debt in the secondary market to spread the risk.
Until recently the prospect of finding five-year commercial financing for
Brazil - whose debt problems made it a semi-exotic market - would have been
impossible. In an improving climate for Latin American risk, the
London-based Indosuez Aval was able to do so in a specially structured deal.
Indosuez and other leading players in the market - including London
Forfaiting Company (LFC), the largest UK specialist forfaiter, and West
Merchant Bank (WMB) - now offer three-year or five-year terms for Brazil,
reflecting the return to financial credibility of South America's largest
economy.
An additional problem in the Brazilian deal was that manufacture of the
goods would take more than two years, extending the risk period when five
years was the maximum credit on offer.
Over a year of negotiations a deal was structured in which the supplier
arranged for immediate payment to be made. This kept the main risk to five
years. In return the parent of the supplier and Indosuez Aval put up
performance guarantee bonds, and to secure the deal Banco do Brasil came in
to back a letter of credit.
Concluding the deal was difficult and protracted with final approval
required at the highest level in Brazil. But drawdown of the financing has
taken place and manufacture has begun. Forfaiting, as a banker close to the
deal puts it, 'provided a solution to an exporting problem'.
The return to financial acceptability of previously heavily indebted
non-OECD markets and the arrival of some newcomers is widening the market.
'I've never known a time when so many different risks have been acceptable
to the market,' says Stephen Rothwell of LFC.
The fortunes of the forfaiting market are linked to trade flows and country
credit risk. Forfaiters report that demand for the product is strong in
Italy, where according to Denis Keenlyside, a WMB director and forfaiting
expert, 'exporters are more adventurous and are used to the product'.
For the first time in years, forfaiters have cause for optimism about
prospects for financing Latin America, much of Asia, eastern Europe and the
Middle East. There are clear signs the market is recovering from the
collapse in payments of its big clients, Iran and the ex-Soviet Union.
Financing 'semi-exotic' risks such as Brazil and China is becoming
widespread. Deals involving such 'exotic' risks as Vietnam, Peru and Romania
are reported.
Flexibility is important in deals. Forfaiting transactions may not only
involve the pure forfait deals on which the market developed, but also a
range of secondary market and other financing techniques. Forfaiters'
profits are made on the margins of discount, which in difficult (or exotic)
markets such as Peru can be high, but in such areas other forms of trade
finance may be impossible to secure. 'No-one pretends this sort of finance
is cheap,' says Mr Rothwell.
As margins become tight forfaiters can be less keen to do deals. Once a risk
is seen as acceptable margins may remain high for some time. Forfaiters were
attracted to the Iranian market, which boomed in 1990-91, because it was
seen as a good risk and offered margins of 7 to 8 per cent.
As memories of the debt crisis in Latin America recede, investment banks are
again making headlines with bond issues, parastatal corporations are being
privatised and export credit agencies are prepared to back large-scale
contracts 'in the national interest'. But 'in many cases forfaiters were
there first, providing commercial financing before other bankers would move
in', says Mark West of LFC.
Forfaiters are helping open up new capital goods markets. A case in point is
sales out of non-OECD emerging markets. LFC has financed deals as diverse as
the sale of Russian cars to Cyprus to Slovenian buses to Egypt.
China is emerging as a big forfaiting market. Forfaiting techniques have
caught on for Chinese operations, especially in Italy, which is making a
concerted push into the Chinese market. Companies with traditional links
with the Chinese market are also investigating the technique. For example, a
joint venture with Hong Kong partners has forfaited a deal for the Dollars
18m contract for installing a plant to make paper pulp from wheat straw in
Feicheng city, Shandong province.
They forfaited the deal through WMB, which was able to sell down the deal
backed by the guarantee (or 'aval') of Agricultural Bank of China.
Limits on how much risk will be taken on in 'difficult markets' depend on
the nature of the risk and the local bank providing its aval for the deal.
WMB will cover up to three years risk for Vietnam, but only for smaller
deals. 'We wouldn't do Dollars 10m on Vietnam but we would on Mexico or
Brazil,' Mr Keenlyside says. As the Vietnamese market matures, this view can
be expected to change.
Levels of business are growing. LFC reports trading income rising by 43 per
cent to Pounds 15.5m in the six months to 30 June 1993 due to increased
activity. WMB reports an annual volume of forfaiting business in excess of
Dollars 1bn. Mr Keenlyside says that in 1992 it arranged some 300 purchase
transactions in 33 countries.
And newcomers are emerging far beyond the forfaiting markets centres of
London, Zurich and Frankfurt, even though these remain the world's
forfaiting centres.
For active markets such as Italy, forfaiters may market their products
through local subsidiaries while the deals themselves are more likely to be
structured in London than Milan. But new players are slowly emerging away
from the forfaiting market's traditional centres.
Tunisia's largest commercial bank, Societe Tunisienne de Banque (STB), has,
according to its chairman Abdellatif Jerijeni, 'started offering forfaiting
services to our clients, many of whom are looking to export more'. STB
decided to establish forfaiting operations to mark its position as a bank
offering the services needed in an exporting economy,' he says.
Forfaiting is evolving and its advocates believe the technique has a role to
play everywhere that exporting is developing as a way of life.

FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (4): Regional blocks strengthening - Changes in
tariffs and quotas promised by Gatt, Nafta and the EC are pushing the
industry towards closer regional ties / Textiles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE business of selling clothing and textiles in foreign countries is a more
uncertain enterprise than it has been for many years. A labyrinthine world
of tariffs and quotas is likely to be changed radically by three factors:
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), the North American Free
Trade Agreement (Nafta) and closer economic links between EC member states
and countries in eastern Europe and north Africa that are tempting
manufacturers to invest there.
They promise to transform the existing trading environment into one based
more heavily on regional trading blocks of Asia, the Americas and
Europe/north Africa.
The existing structure consists of Asian manufacturers selling to western
and Japanese consumers, with sales limited largely by quotas and tariffs
designed to protect jobs in customer countries.
The complexity of these rules should not be underestimated. The existing
Multi Fibre Arrangement (MFA), which a new Gatt may replace, is a set of
bilaterally negotiated trade quotas with explicit limits on, for example,
the number of knitted underwear pieces that can be exported from Hong Kong
to the UK.
In parallel with the MFA, individual countries impose import tariffs. Since
textiles is a fragmented industry, the various lobbying forces have
succeeded in creating several layers of tariffs: the US, for example, levies
five different tariffs, according to such criteria as whether the goods
being imported are narrow or wide fabrics, rabbit hair yarn or yarn made
from other materials. Tariffs can be percentages of the value of goods,
fixed increments or a mixture of both.
What the draft Gatt agreement proposes is a phasing out of MFA quotas and a
reduction of tariffs. This would take place over more than a decade with the
changes weighted towards the second half of that period.
Paradoxically, the elimination of quotas could benefit European companies,
says Kurt Salmon Associates, the textile industry consultancy.
It argues that European markets are already saturated with cheap clothing
from low cost suppliers, mainly in Asian countries. 'Growth will therefore
come from higher quality products at higher prices,' it says.
For US companies, however, and European companies exporting to the US, life
may become more difficult.
As well as the elimination of MFA quotas, they face the challenge of a
tariff-free border with Mexico under Nafta. US companies are particularly
vulnerable since they are more protected than their European counterparts:
Gatt estimates suggest that protection for clothing may now be costing a
family of four up to Dollars 420 a year in the US, Dollars 220 a year in
Canada and Dollars 130 a year in the UK.
The US textiles and clothing industry is split over its support for Nafta.
The American Textile Manufacturers Institute, the industry's trade body, is
in favour of Nafta. It argues that new markets will be opened and that
imports from low-wage Mexico will displace those from the Far East.
But the anti-Nafta lobby is gaining support. Led by Roger Milliken,
president of Milliken &amp; Co, one of America's most profitable textile
manufacturers, it argues that the flow of textile and clothing jobs to
Mexico would only accelerate as a result of Nafta.
There are nevertheless some parallels between Europe and the US because low
wage countries such as Morocco and Poland are winning special trade deals
with the European Community.
Although these deals fall short of the Single Market structure envisaged in
Nafta, they will still affect clothing and textile trading patterns.
A recent market study by consultancy David Rigby Associates took as a
working assumption that half the volume of garments currently imported into
the EC from south and east Asia will eventually be sourced from eastern
Europe and North Africa.
This change would increase the role of outward processing in which EC
companies cut EC produced cloth, send it to a non-EC country for assembly
into garments and bring it back for finishing. This allows them to sell the
garment as Made in an EC country and take advantage of the Single Market.
Outward processing is popular in Germany, because of its proximity to
eastern Europe. In the old days, German companies did their outward
processing in what was East Germany. Today Poland, the Czech Republic and
Romania are the big suppliers.
Outward processing is still a new phenomenon for France and the UK but
investment is already growing in North Africa.
Finally, the lower wage Asian countries, especially in south-east Asia and
China are becoming suppliers to the likes of Japan and South Korea as well
as their traditional customers in the west. The response of Japanese
companies, for example, has been to become more like their western
counterparts, closing domestic plants and building new ones in nearby
countries.
These changes appear to point to a drift of manufacturing towards Mexico and
the fringes of the EC at the expense of Asian countries.
There may yet be some way to go before a single global market is achieved as
Gatt perhaps envisages. But the combination of Gatt, Nafta and the EC seems
to be pushing trade in clothing and textiles to ever larger regional blocks.

FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (5): A lacklustre performance - Measures to cool
down China's economy and avoid a deficit are dampening exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER more than a decade of spectacular results on the trade front, China is
coming down to earth as it faces the threat of a trade deficit for 1993
caused by an import binge fuelling its overheating economy. Chinese
officials say they will bring trade into balance by the end of the year,
averting the first deficit since 1989. Figures for the eight months to
August suggest they will have their work cut out.
China's trade deficit grew 27 per cent to Dollars 5.73bn by the end of
August, with imports soaring Dollars 58.14bn and exports climbing only 4 per
cent to Dollars 52.41bn. This compares with a trade surplus of more than
Dollars 4bn in 1992.
But the Chinese leadership, which introduced a stabilisation programme in
mid-year to cool the economy, can take comfort from the fact that since
1979, when it launched its reform programme, exports have increased ninefold
and imports eightfold. In 1980, exports were about Dollars 18bn - less than
1 per cent of world trade and just 4 per cent of gross domestic product.
This year China wants to be among the 'Top 10' trading nations, with more
than 2 per cent of world trade and exports representing about 20 per cent of
GDP, although earlier predictions that exports would exceed Dollars 100bn
are unlikely to be fulfilled.
Among the reasons for China's lacklustre export performance this year is the
fact that a booming domestic market has proved more appealing for many
potential exporters. The diversion of investment funds away from
export-generating activities to the 'hot money' areas of real estate and
currency speculation is another factor. Further, inflation of more than 20
per cent in urban centres has pushed up costs, making certain categories of
exports less competitive.
The World Bank, in its annual study of the Chinese economy, found massive
growth in fixed investment pushed up prices of raw materials at a rate of
nearly 40 per cent in the early part of this year. Excess demand had created
bottlenecks in transport and energy supplies - factors which hindered
China's export performance.
One of the main targets of China's recent reforms, spearheaded by tough
economic czar Zhu Rongji, vice-premier in charge of the economy, has been to
rein in speculative activities and give more weight to infrastructure
development and export-generating industries.
The other burning issue for China - and for the west, which has an acute
interest in liberalisation of Chinese trade - is Beijing's step towards
re-joining the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Progress is slow, not
only because China has a long way to go before it can be deemed
'Gatt-consistent', but also because the west wants to ensure that a new
trade juggernaut in its midst has to play by the rules.
The World Bank study exposes the task confronting China in its efforts to
conform with the minimum standards required by Gatt signatories as far as
tariff and non-tariff barriers are concerned. For example, in 1992 more than
50 per cent of China's imports were subject to some form of non-tariff
administrative control.
China's tariffs, according to the World Bank, remain higher, more numerous
and more dispersed than most other large developing countries, with 69 rates
and a standard deviation of 30 per cent, compared with 34 rates and 17 per
cent for Brazil at an identical average tariff rate.
Other hold-ups to China's Gatt entry include its managed multi-tiered
exchange rate regime. Beijing has taken several important steps towards
making the renminbi more freely convertible, but its quota system of foreign
exchange allocation through Foreign Exchange Adjustment Centres is subject
to manipulation by the authorities to the detriment of a freer trading
environment.
China's anxiety over its entry to Gatt and its annual securing of Most
Favoured Nation trading status underscore its growing dependence on the
world economy.
China has much to gain from a successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round
which, the World Bank says, could reduce protection levels in the European
Commission, the US and Japan by up to 50 per cent. In that case, the study
says, China's exports would increase by an estimated 38 per cent or Dollars
11.4bn in 1988 prices, partly due to the relatively high share of textiles
and clothing products in its total exports.
Conversely, China stands to lose much by removal of MFN and is likely to try
to satisfy requirements for renewal next year on the human rights front and
by continuing to improve market access and render its trade regulations less
opaque. Loss of MFN after June 1994, the bank says, would mean China's
annual export losses to the US would range from 42 to 96 per cent (Dollars
7bn to Dollars 15.2bn).
'On the whole, it appears that the dislocation of trade flows likely to
result from the withdrawal of China's MFN status by the US would range from
the dramatic to the disastrous,' the World Bank says. The US market, where
China enjoys a huge surplus, is critical to its plans to raise exports. Its
surplus with the US exceeded Dollars 18bn last year and hit Dollars 9.49bn
in the first half of this year.

FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (3): A winning combination - Strong economic
growth and a population keen to raise living standards means this is a
market foreigners cannot ignore / Profile of Poland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE packaging on a humble orange ice-lolly sold from an ice-cream van this
summer was surprisingly revealing. The ingredients of the lolly - produced
at a plant in Germany and clearly intended for the new pan-European market
made possible by the disintegration of the iron curtain - were printed in
German, French, Dutch, English, Czech, Hungarian and Polish.
The package neatly illustrated the degree to which a common European market
extending from the Atlantic to the eastern borders of Poland is now a
reality for the manufacturers and marketers of consumer goods.
But of all the new markets that opened up at the start of this decade,
Poland is rapidly becoming the most interesting for both foreign investors
and exporters. The first of the post-communist states to embark upon a
programme of rapid economic reform in January 1990, Poland could well
register Europe's most dynamic economic growth this year and foreign trade
will be where most of the growth is generated.
The combination of up to 4.5 per cent real economic growth and a 39m-strong
population which is determined to achieve western-style living standards as
soon as possible lies at the root of Poland's attractiveness.
An economic transformation has taken place over the past four years, in
spite of frequent changes of government and four unstable coalition
governments in as many years. Last month Poles cast their votes decisively
in favour of political parties with young, pragmatic leaders but whose roots
are in the communist era.
This brings the risk of slower growth and higher inflation, but also the
possibility of a more stable political base for continuing the
market-orientated reforms sweeping the country in recent years.
These have raised the living standards of skilled and entrepreneurial Poles
but been painful for the nearly 3m unemployed, pensioners and low-paid
government sector workers. Future left of centre governments will have to
tread a thin line between a greater degree of care for the weak and
encouragement for the strong in order to continue creating the new wealth
that is needed for future growth.
Many of the former bloated state-owned industries have been transformed into
leaner, more competitive units eager for imported components to raise the
quality of their finished products. But the real force behind Poland's
renaissance is the fast-growing private trading and manufacturing sector
whose active entrepreneurs are busy seeking new technology, new products and
new partners.
Contacting these private entrepreneurs and traders is becoming easier.
Sophisticated, frequently updated trade directories with full details of
Polish companies are now available. The most comprehensive is the General
Trade Index and Business Guide published by the Business Foundation Company
at Krucza 38/42, Warsaw 00512. This contains full details on a wide range of
state and privately-owned companies.
The London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and a
large number of western merchant banks, accounting and consultancy firms
have also acquired intimate knowledge of the new players.
Those that are actively involved in Poland's complex privatisation schemes
have accumulated detailed information on 36 industrial sectors selected as
ripe for privatisation. The Polish commercial offices in London and other
capitals have been upgraded.
Since Poland's economic turnaround began in May 1992, industrial production
has risen steadily month by month. Over the first half of this year alone
manufacturing output was up 12.8 per cent compared with the first six months
of 1992, according to a recent study by Salomon Brothers.
The rise in output has led to a surge in imports, resulting in a Dollars
1.1bn trade deficit over the first half of this year and forcing the
authorities to devalue the zloty by 8 per cent at the end of August. In
recent months the government has also raised import tariffs on many
products, including cars and some foodstuffs.
But many of the imports are connected with rising investment by leading US
and European corporations, including a wide range of consumer product
companies. The growing market and low labour costs have attracted the
leading soap, detergent and personal product manufacturers and fast-food
franchisers, led by PepsiCo - which alone has an ambitious Dollars 500m
investment plan for fast food and soft drinks - and McDonald's.
The car industry is another sector slated for fast growth. The largest
single commitment is that of Fiat which is investing Dollars 2bn to build
new low-cost models, starting with the Cinquecento, for the regional and
wider European market. Fiat is pulling in a plethora of Italian component
suppliers while Volkswagen, Peugeot, General Motors and Ford have also set
their sights on the Polish market.
The attractiveness of Poland as a market for consumer goods has been
transformed by a revolution which has shifted the trade and retail sector
into private hands. Not just Warsaw and the main cities, but even tiny
villages now boast western-style mini-markets and smart new shops.
Ambitious plans envisage new east-west and north-south motorways which will
reduce costs and underline Poland's strategic position as the main link
between Germany and the former Soviet republics.
Private, cross-border trade between Poland and the Baltic States, Ukraine,
Belorussia and Russia itself is also starting to take off with Poland's
resourceful money changers along the border changing virtually worthless
roubles or Ukrainian coupons into internally convertible zloties and back
again while traders work out ingenious barter deals through which to sell
coveted western consumer goods in return for such items as caviar and
smuggled gold.
In the longer term, Poland will be an increasingly big market for power
generation, construction and other infrastructure-building equipment,
something well recognised by investors such as Siemens and ABB, with a
string of strategic investments behind them.

FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (2): International trade looks east - As strong
growth in GDP in East Asia continues, James Blitz examines the implications
for the leading industrialised countries of a possible tilt in the balance
of economic power / World economic trends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the biggest challenges to anyone involved in international trade
today is the development of East Asia as an economic force.
The world economy continues to be dominated by the leading industrial powers
 -including the US, Germany and Japan - which produce 79 per cent of world
merchandise exports and 87 per cent of exports of manufactures.
But predictions about the future growth of the economies of of East Asia -
including China, Taiwan and Hong Kong - have led some economists to think
the world is on the verge of a big shift in the balance of economic power -
one which will be classed alongside the successive rises of the UK, US and
Japan in the two centuries since the industrial revolution.
The growth of what the World Bank has dubbed the 'Chinese Economic Area'
(CEA) could also have a big impact on trade flows around the world. At the
same time, economic growth in the region - which is based on cheap labour,
flexible workforces, and rapidly rising skill levels - is a challenge to
western levels of competitiveness and could pose a threat to employment
levels in Europe and the US.
'The major industrial countries face significant adjustment,' said Paul
Armington and Uri Dadush, World Bank economists, in a recent article on the
region. 'The world economy will have to adjust to the emerging strength of
the CEA in the same way that it had to adjust to the emergence of Japan two
or three decades earlier.'
What are the prospects for the growth of this region ?
At the market exchange rate, the gross domestic product of the CEA was
Dollars 600bn in 1991, or about half that of France. But, according to
Messrs Armington and Dadush, the CEA will, by 2002, rank fourth in the world
in terms of GDP, well ahead of France, Italy and the UK, and more than four
times the size of India. They do not exclude the possibility that, by 2010,
the region will rival the US in terms of GDP.
The CEA also contributes to the development of the Asian economies as a
whole and to a process by which an increasing share of their total trade is
with other countries in the Asian region - not because of any trade block,
but because rising income levels mean more end-products are being consumed
in the region.
The Chinese region is raising the growth potential of its trade partners.
Malaysia, for example, exports 6.3 per cent of its GDP to China alone.
In turn, the world export market share of the Asia-Pacific rim countries -
the CEA plus Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and
Thailand - grew from 19 per cent in 1970 to 30 per cent in 1992. Economists
at American Express Bank wrote recently that this improvement in Asia's
trade performance and the growth of intra-regional trade would help its
member countries to withstand demand slowdowns in Japan, the US and the EC.
Analysts are now asking themselves what impact this region will have on
world trade as a whole.
The first issue that concerns exporters is whether this region will attract
more flows from powerful neighbours such as Japan, reducing Japanese
investment in the US and the EC. As yet, those fears seem unfounded. There
is certainly a strong flow of Japanese investment into Asia, and Japan
already exports some 1.3 per cent of its GDP to the CEA region. But Japanese
investment flows to the US and to Europe have been equally strong. According
to Japanese officials, less than 15 per cent of their country's investment
has gone to Asia in recent years
Instead, the most highly publicised attempts to cement ties with this region
in recent months have come more from the US. Government officials in
Washington say more than 40 per cent of US trade is now with the Asian
region. Attempts are being made to cement US-Asian ties through Apec, the
Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation group. The group's November meeting in
Seattle will be important to the development of those ties.
EC officials have argued that Apec may be little more than a stick with
which the US is trying to beat Europe, as trade pressures between the two
blocs continue. The future of the Apec initiative may depend, in part, on
whether tensions develop between the US and the EC in their attempts to
conclude the Uruguay round of trade negotiations later this year.
The second issue of concern to exporters is whether the region could turn
into a protectionist trading bloc, putting tariffs on imports and exports to
the EC and North America.
Economists argue that the conditions for this do not exist. Asian markets
are geographically far apart. They have disparate levels of income - ranging
from a per capita income of Dollars 600 per head in Indonesia to Dollars
16,000 a head in Hong Kong - and different levels of resource development -
Malaysia has plenty of natural resources while Korea has almost none.
More threatening would be the development of protectionist attitudes by the
US or EC towards Asia because of the huge differential in labour costs.
According to Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, German labour costs this
year will average Dollars 24.87 an hour, US labour costs will average
Dollars 16.40 an hour, and Chinese labour costs only 44 cents per hour. The
demand for comparatively unskilled labour is therefore certain to be
adversely affected by the growth of the Asian developing economies.
But European countries would, in turn, lose heavily by imposing tariff
barriers on Asian imports. A protectionist policy would mean the loss of
western exports of high technology to these markets as they develop. At the
same time, some economists argue that there is plenty of scope for the
growth of a highly skilled labour force which could put the final touches to
semi-finished products made in Asia.
The hope must be that the politicians understand that the CEA could become a
leading market for high technology and capital goods exports from the
industrial world. The danger is that the industrialised nations will take
the easy, protectionist road in an attempt to protect the short-term
interests of its unskilled labour force.

FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (1): Global trade on the brink - David Dodwell
argues that failure of the Gatt talks to reach agreement could damage
exporters' order books as early as 1994 and leave a 'Fortress Europe' on the
sidelines of international trade / Comment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Uruguay Round of world trade talks, and the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (Gatt), may seem far removed from the daily concerns of small and
medium-sized exporters across the UK and the continent of Europe. But this
will not be the case over the coming two months, as make-or-break
negotiations ahead of a December 15 deadline seek to cut tariff barriers,
and boost world trade.
It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of these talks, focused on the
Gatt headquarters on the edge of Lake Geneva. Failure of the negotiations
could lead to a rapid escalation of trade conflict, with higher tariffs, a
blizzard of anti-dumping actions, and countervailing duties against
subsidised exports.
The risk of failure is high, in part because time is running short, and in
part because recession and high levels of unemployment have made governments
baulk over the last, difficult compromises.
Unhappily for European companies, there is also a considerable risk that
Europe - and in particular France - would be blamed for the failure of the
talks, because of a refusal to stand by an agreement made a year ago to cut
back on Europe's exports of subsidised farm products.
Some in Europe may argue that the cost of failure would be small. After all,
European companies on average sell two thirds of their exports to other
European Community countries.
Planned growth of the EC would embrace the Efta countries of Sweden, Norway,
Finland, Iceland, Austria and Switzerland and establish special
relationships with the liberalising economies of eastern and central Europe,
leading to a wider European market of around 400m people. As such, some will
argue that EC companies will be able to turn further inward without paying
any particularly high price for the loss of export opportunities outside
Europe.
But others would argue that such a retreat behind the walls of 'Fortress
Europe' would be catastrophic. First to suffer would be transnational
companies which spread production across the globe: obstacles to the free
flow of components from one subsidiary to another could force them to
relocate outside Europe, or trim operations to serve Europe alone.
This danger cannot be overestimated, since intra-company trade accounts for
over 40 per cent of all trade. Europe's companies account for 52 per cent of
the world's stock of international direct investment - totalling Dollars
956bn at the end of 1991 - with almost half of this invested outside Europe.
With such deep roots in the world economy, thoughts of retreat behind
Europe's fortress walls are nothing short of naive. This is starkest of all
for Britain, Germany, France and the Netherlands - Europe's leading foreign
investors - although it is possible that the negligible reliance of France
or Italy on inward investment from countries outside Europe could distort
public perceptions there.
Behind the multinationals, small and medium-sized companies would quickly
suffer in their wake, since many have developed in order to supply them with
components and other products and services.
Declining competitiveness would almost certainly follow, as companies inside
Europe were protected from the international competition that ensures the
highest possible levels of efficiency, and the exploitation of new
technologies.
European competitiveness is already a mounting problem, because of the high
price paid across Europe for subsidies to the farm sector, and to
loss-making state-run enterprises such as those in the steel sector.
The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development,
which represents the world's leading industrial nations, says farm subsidies
alone cost Dollars 354bn last year, with Europe's share by far the largest
at Dollars 156bn.
It is self-evident how heavy a burden this is on Europe's consumers and
manufacturers - with the inevitable danger that export opportunities to the
world's fastest-growing economies in Asia would be lost because Europe's
products are uncompetitively expensive.
There are without question immense opportunities in the Asia Pacific region,
in spite of increasing self-reliance, and Japan's obvious geographic
advantages. After a decade of economic growth averaging between 6 and 10 per
cent, countries such as China, Taiwan, Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia and
Thailand are becoming significant consumer markets in their own right.
Even though they have industrialised rapidly, and have comparative
advantages linked to low labour costs that make it difficult for exporters
to supply anything except high-technology goods, these countries have a
virtually insatiable need for foreign investment and high-tech imports in
the decade ahead.
This has been well realised by the US which has just launched an export
promotion programme targeted hard at Asia which aims to lift exports from
Dollars 700bn last year to Dollars 1,000bn by the year 2000.
Also notable, President Bill Clinton has given high priority to a summit in
Seattle in mid-November of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation grouping.
At the very least, this is intended to forge closer trade and investment
links across the Pacific.
At worst - if Uruguay Round negotiations are going badly, with blame being
laid at Europe's door because of intransigence over liberalisation of farm
trade - it could be used to discuss trade reforms excluding Europe, and
possible trade sanctions against European companies in retaliation against
the continued export of subsidised farm products.
It is perhaps this danger that prompted John Major, the British prime
minister, to write recently: 'Only our joint interest in success in the
Geneva negotiations has kept Europe and America back from trade war.
Breakdown in those talks would threaten a repeat of the protectionism and
isolationism of the 1930s, when production fell by one fifth, and investment
by half.
'Failure would lead to an immediate crisis within the EC in its relations
with the US, countries of the Cairns group (of farm exporting countries),
and the whole developing world.'
For an average managing director in a small company in the EC, this may all
seem heady and remote. But failure could mean damage to order books quite
early in 1994.
Success on the other hand is forecast to lead to net gains in world income
of Dollars 213bn by the year 2002, when the full force of Uruguay Round
reforms would be in place. Can there be any doubt over the choice?

FT  13 OCT 93 / Mitsotakis steps down as leader of party

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GREECE'S outgoing prime minister, Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, 75, is stepping
down as leader of the conservative New Democracy party following its defeat
by the Socialists in Sunday's election.
The two strongest contenders to succeed him are Mr Miltiades Evert, a former
mayor of Athens who launched the city's first private radio station, and Mr
Ioannis Varvitsiotis, defence minister in the defeated government.
Final election results, announced yesterday, gave Mr Andreas Papandreou's
Socialists 46.9 per cent of the vote and 171 seats in the 300-member
parliament.
New Democracy won 39.3 per cent and 110 seats. Political Spring, a
conservative splinter group headed by Mr Antonis Samaras, took third place
with 4.9 per cent and 10 seats.
The Greek Communist party, with 4.6 per cent of the vote and nine seats,
will be the only other party in parliament.
Mr Papandreou was expected to announce his cabinet late yesterday. Mr
Giorgos Gennimatas, a former labour minister, was expected to take the
economy portfolio. Mr Carolos Papoulias was tipped as foreign minister, a
job he held during the Socialists' previous term in 1981-89.

FT  13 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: P&amp;O strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Transport and property group P&amp;O moved against the poor market trend after
BZW recommended the stock. The securities house was said to have met with
the company on Monday evening and yesterday issued the recommendation which
saw the shares put on 6 to 594p, in trade of 1.8m.
The stock has been a poor performer since a slide in the shares in early
September which followed the release of figures that disappointed the
market. Analysts and brokers from other securities houses remain cautious
about the stock, not least because of the competition P&amp;O is likely to face
with next year's planned opening of the Channel Tunnel. One analyst said:
'It is a little too early to start being positive on P&amp;O'
A broker's recommendation helped Glynwed International stand out in an
otherwise dull day in the engineering sector. The shares advanced 9 to 330p,
after Smith New Court upgraded profit estimates. Leaving its current year
estimate at Pounds 43m, the broker lifted the following year's forecast by
Pounds 4.5m to Pounds 61m, and penciled in Pounds 86m as its forecast for
1995.
Mr Ian Lowe at Smith said the group has reported an improvement in a number
of its business areas and 'growth in group earnings will accelerate the rate
shown by the market by perhaps another year.'
Disappointing interim figures that were accompanied by a warning of lower
than forecast full-year profits hit FR Group, sending the shares tumbling 18
to 232p.
British Aerospace moved 3 1/2 forward to 407p after James Capel was reported
to be favourable on the stock.
Strong two-way business following Monday's favourable figures, continued in
automotive and aero-engine components group Lucas Industries. Turnover at
the close stood at a hefty 7.6m, although the shares remained unchanged at
167p.
Optimism over Wellcome ahead of next week's conference in New Orleans
continued to buoy the shares and the price rose 8 to 736p. Volume was above
average at 3.9m and Mr Peter Laing at Salomon Bros said the shares had begun
to look oversold and looked ready to catch up ground lost to Glaxo and
Fisons.
The rest of the sector enjoyed similar investment interest with many of the
stocks making steady progress. Glaxo added 3 to close at 668p with 5.6m
shares traded; Fisons moved ahead a penny to 167p and Zeneca jumped 5 to
760p. Although some industry analysts are still cautious on drugs, one
influential US brokerage, thought to be Wertheim Schroder, has just gone
positive on the whole sector.
Profit-taking was the main element in the food manufacturing sector, which
earlier in the week had seen one of its increasingly few bright days.
Northern Foods shed 5 to 265p, Hillsdown 5 to 162p and United Biscuits 3 to
363p.
Food retailers also succumbed to profit-takers after their recent bounce.
Argyll Group slipped 8 to 297p, J Sainsbury 10 to 427p and Tesco 4 to 209p.
Talk of one broker trying to place a large line of Storehouse, left the
shares unruffled at 207p. Boots, subject of speculation in recent sessions
over its home improvement and drugs divisions, continued to climb, the
shares adding 8 to 502p.
The climb by United Newspapers of 15 to 538p was ascribed largely to a
broker's upbeat presentation at a lunch for investors.
An upbeat profits forecast for BSkyB from Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corp
ricocheted through stocks with an interest in the satellite broadcaster.
Pearson, publisher of the Financial Times, put on 14 to 542p, while Granada
added 15 to 487p and News International gained 3 to 270p.
Although the predictions were in line with most analysts' expectations, the
effect on newspaper-orientated stocks was attributed by one industry
specialist to the fact that investors have been lacking good news in the
sector and are fearful of the imposition of VAT on newspapers.
A steady climb was mustered by BOC which advanced 4 to 642p in moderate
volume of 1.6m. The stock has been bolstered by a recent buy note from Hoare
Govett which points to a healthy dividend.
ICI fared poorly, losing 9 to 723p, albeit in low volume and without obvious
motivation.
The threat of an investigation into compact disc prices in the US undermined
Thorn EMI, the shares retreating 19 to 933p. An investigation is already
under way in the UK by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. CDs account
for around 40 per cent of the group's profits.
Selling just before the market close, said to be from the US, brought a
sharp retreat in ADT and the shares closed 21 lower at 560p. Sentiment in
the stock has been weak on fears that stake holder Laidlaw was about to
dispose of its holding. Last week's profits warning from rival Automated
Security has also dampened enthusiasm for the stock. Shares in Automated
lost another 6 to 97p. McKechnie, which reports figures later this month,
was in demand and the shares hardened 8 to 453p.
News group Reuters was in favour, the shares adding 13 to 1531p, after an
announcement that it had signed an agreement to distribute several key
information data bases of Standard &amp; Poor's Equity services group in the US.
UK airports operator BAA put on 4 to 882p after it said September traffic
through its airports rose by 6.4 per cent to 8.1m passengers, on a year ago.
There was further selling of Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel, following
Monday's interim statement at which the company said it needs to raise a
further Pounds 1bn by mid-May 1994. The shares fell 29 to 459p, with most of
the day's trading once again said to have been carried out in Paris where
the shares are also listed.
The firm performance of the Hong Kong market helped Standard Chartered brush
aside a reported profits downgrade from UBS. The shares finished 15 ahead at
1008p.

FT  13 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Guinness upset again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The resignation of the managing director of United Distillers left Guinness
shares trailing as the rumours swirling round the stock over the past week
appeared to reflect some element of truth. The shares retreated 15 initially
but rallied to close 7 off at 396p, with a hefty 10m traded.
Yesterday's decline means the stock has now fallen 23 per cent in the past
six weeks as poor results last month have been compounded by a succession of
negative stories in the market. Most have concerned LVMH, the French luxury
goods group which has a near-25 per cent cross holding in Guinness.
Talk in Paris last week that LVMH is looking to raise capital refuses to die
away and in London has brought suggestions that it may sell Guinness its
spirits business in return for the stake in LVMH. On Monday, Guinness shares
were under pressure as a story of an imminent executive departure began to
circulate.

FT  13 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: GrandMet fall steals limelight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRINKS group Grand Metropolitan (GrandMet) once again stole the stock market
limelight yesterday announcing the loss of a major contract and seeing its
shares drop 4 per cent, the steepest in the FT-SE 100.
The group is losing its distribution contract for Absolut Vodka in the US
after 13 years. Drinks analysts said that the contract was worth between
Pounds 30-Pounds 40m a year in profits, although the impact would not be
felt until the company's 1995 results.
The revelation came as a shock to the London market, which has only just
recovered from the flurry of news from GrandMet two weeks ago. This included
boardroom changes and the sale of its Chef and Brewer chain for Pounds 730m
to Scottish and Newcastle. GrandMet shares tumbled on yesterday's news,
slipping below 400p at one stage, before recovering to close at 403p, a net
fall of 15 on the day. Turnover was a chunky 13m.
One analyst said that the succession of announcements from the company was
unsettling for sentiment and that the latest development had forced analysts
to scale down their forecasts for earnings growth.

FT  13 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie Index drifts below 3,100
level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FAVOURABLE legal ruling in Germany on the Maastricht Treaty, together with
renewed hints of a base cut in the UK, proved unable to stir much interest
in the London stock market yesterday. Investors, already unsettled by the
widening in the UK trade gap, backed away ahead of the UK Retail price index
(RPI) for September, due this morning.
Belief that constitutional approval for Maastricht from the German High
Court would hearten European bourses helped the FT-SE Index to 3,115.2 early
in the session. But when the legal ruling came, London, together with the
German stock, lost impetus and the Footsie 3,100 mark was lost in sluggish
trading, for a day's low point of 3,093.
Trading volume in the blue chips picked up towards the close to show a final
Seaq total of 536.8m shares. On Monday, when business was reduced by holiday
closures in Tokyo and the US, Seaq volume of only 444.4m shares was worth a
mere Pounds 936.1m at retail level, the first daily figure below Pounds 1bn
for many months.
The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 3,094.7, down 7.5 on the day.
Second line issues played little part in the initial rally in the market and
closed without recovery. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index shed 7.3 to 3,474.9.
The stock market's nervousness reflected caution ahead of this week's heavy
list of economic data. Much of the session passed without significant trends
developing, as it became clear that the big institutions were keeping out of
the way.
Activity in the short sterling contract lay behind the stock market's hopes
for an early base rates cut. But equity strategists brushed such hopes aside
for the time being, and focused on the prospects for today's inflation
statistics.
The market's median forecast is for an annualised RPI number unchanged at
1.7 per cent in September. However, some market firms predict a higher
figure and warn of the danger that inflationary pressure could be returning
sooner than expected.
With Wall Street making a slow return to full trading power after the
Columbus Day break, the Dow Industrial Average gave little lead, showing a
minor gain as London closed for the day. Leading oil shares edged higher
behind crude oil prices but the pharmaceuticals lacked direction.
The base rate hints were not strong enough to impress share prices in
sectors likely to be affected by such a move. Bank stocks, which have this
week been responsive to interest rate optimism, made little change, while in
the store sector, shares were mostly easier in thin trade.
The most active features were among the hotel and brewing sectors, but
investors were merely responding to the events of the day rather than
initiating any fresh strategies. The leisure sector remained a prey to the
rumours of adverse corporate developments which have been circulating over
the past fortnight.
The big investment funds showed signs of having returned to a defensive
posture until the November Budget is safely out of the way. Mr Craig Knox at
Lazard Investors warns that 'the good news' - base rate cuts, small tax
rises - may already be in the market, while 'potential bad news' - lower
relief on Advance Corporation Tax or higher rates of corporation tax - is
far from the market's current thoughts.

FT  13 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACTIVE options trading was in sharp contrast to a a dull session in FT-SE
futures, writes Christine Buckley.
Muted speculation of a cut today in interest rates failed to excite Footsie
futures. The rate cut rumour, which gripped short sterling trading
especially, made no waves outside fixed income markets and futures seemed
largely locked in a pre-Budget paralysis. Large investors were said to have
kept their distance.
With no stimulus on offer from other European markets the December contract
on the FT-SE 100 sailed listlessly downstream, mostly trading at fair value,
which stands at 21 points.
Even a bouncy opening was not all it appeared and the contract's short climb
in early trading was partly down to investors rectifying positions from the
previous day when there had been a substantial amount of after-hours
selling.
December's high point of the day - at 3,142 - was quickly lost and the
pattern was downward for most of the session. A small rally was mustered
after the post-lunchtime low of 3,112 and the contract was picked up to
close at 3,120 - just over 3 points in front of its fair value premium to
the cash market.
Index options showed life as sights are set on the year end and there is
more hedging of positions. The option on the FT-SE 100 traded 20,874 lots
while the Euro FT-SE saw business in 4,419 lots.

FT  13 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Blue chips stagnant as
mid-size stocks surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US BLUE chips ended a lacklustre session little changed yesterday, although
mid-size stocks and over-the-counter issues rose to new record highs, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.28 at 3,593.13.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.24 higher at 461.12,
while the Amex composite finished up 2.91 at an all-time high of 470.50, and
the Nasdaq composite up 4.81 at a record 772.46. Trading volume on the NYSE
was 265m.
The stage was set for some early gains when trading in New York opened, but
they never really materialised. Although overseas markets were weaker
overnight, analysts still felt that conditions were right for a bullish
market yesterday.
They believed that sentiment would strengthen after Monday's modest advances
in stock prices, that the morning decline in long bond yields to an all-time
low of under 5.9 per cent, and that a series of better-than-expected third
quarter corporate earnings reports would all boost demand for stocks.
However, after breaking through 3,600 in the early part of the session, the
Dow fell back quickly as buying petered out. A retreat by bonds after
midday, spurred by a rise in gold and other commodities prices, did not
help, and by mid-afternoon the Dow had slipped into negative territory.
Secondary stocks traded on the American Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq
market, however, remained strong throughout the day. Among individual
stocks, brokerage issues were in demand after three of Wall Street's biggest
securities firms - Merrill Lynch, PaineWebber and Bear Stearns - all
reported record or near-record quarterly earnings that exceeded analysts'
expectations. The news lifted Merrill above Dollars 100 for the first time,
and it came as no surprise when it announced plans for a two-for-one stock
split. Merrill shares ended up Dollars 2 7/8 at Dollars 101 5/8 ,

FT  13 OCT 93 / World Trade News (Europe): Frankfurt slips gently below
2,000 level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACTIVITY was muted yesterday in many of the senior bourses, writes Our
Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT slipped below 2,000 again, the DAX index closing 12.41 lower at
1,998.61 in what was described as a much needed consolidation after five
consecutive record highs.
Turnover fell from DM8.5bn to DM5.6bn. Most blue chips fell by 1 per cent or
more but there was resistance at the top of the market where Daimler rose 50
pfg to DM741.50, Volkswagen by DM2.50 to DM376, Deutsche Bank was just pfg
60 lower at DM741.50 and Siemens fell DM3.50 to DM709.50.
The pharmaceuticals company, Schering, saw more profit-taking as it fell
DM22 to DM1,019; and the chemicals group, Hoechst, had a similar slip,
dropping DM6 to DM285.50 as analysts continued to say that the bid for 51
per cent of the US generic drug maker, Copley Pharmaceutical, looked
expensive.
The biggest blue chip loser was the tyremaker, Continental, down DM6.40, or
2.8 per cent to DM225.60 after a MM Warburg Investment Research report
forecasting a savage drop in 1993 net profits.
PARIS remained a seller of Eurotunnel with the shares losing a further 7.4
per cent as the shares slipped FFr3.10 to FFr39.00. The market is expecting
a rights issue from the group, probably at the start of next year.
The CAC-40 index lost 11.87 to 2,126.85 in turnover of FFr2.8bn.
Further rumours swept around Euro Disney as the stock lost FFr1.55 to
FFr50.35, while, among the gainers SocGen put on FFr9 to FFr698.
Trading in both Suez and UAP was suspended in preparation for an
announcement, long heralded, on Groupe Victoire.
MILAN turned its attention to the savings shares of privatisation candidates
after Credito Italiano and BCI announced share exchange schemes late on
Monday. The broader market, however, was unable to make progress and the
Comit index shed 4.81 to 579.94.
News that Mr Paolo Savona, the industry minister, had withdrawn his
resignation, submitted after a row about the privatisation programme, failed
to impress investors. One analyst commented: 'The government's cohesion has
been damaged by this episode and the questions that it raised about the
privatisation programme have not gone away'.
BCI's ordinary shares lost L132 to at L4,466 while savings shares soared
L425 to L4,070. Credito Italiano ordinary shares fell L163 to L2,315 but
savings shares gained L205 to at L1,995.
The switch into savings shares was also evident among other companies slated
for privatisation as investors thought that they might follow the same
course. Sip savings shares added L74 to L2,890 while the ordinary shares
fall L124 to L3,426.
Fiat 's L3,234bn rights issue, scheduled to begin on Friday, continued to
weigh heavily on the market. Fiat shed L117 to L5,710: at a meeting with
analysts on Monday, the group stressed cost cutting measures already
introduced while yesterday, it announced temporary lay-offs of between
13,450 and 38,250 workers in November.
ZURICH turned back from its best levels of the day as banking and insurance
issues ran into profit-taking. The SMI index finished 4.0 higher at a record
2,552.5 after an intraday high of 2,565.9.
Roche certificates, SFr40 higher at SFr5,450, and CS Holdings, SFr25 ahead
at SFr3,175, headed the active list. Zurich Insurance ended SFr1 lower at
SFr1,348 amid reports that one small Zurich bank was swapping Zurich shares
for CS Holding.
Ciba-Geigy registered shares rose SFr3 to SFr720 ahead of results today
which analysts expect to show a small fall in turnover.
Swissair fell SFr15 to SFr720 as officials met executives from the other
three airlines involved in the Alcazar alliance project.
AMSTERDAM was supported slightly by dollar strength and the CBS Tendency
index added 0.2 to 128.7. Among the internationals Unilever rose Fl 2.10 to
Fl 200.70.
STOCKHOLM remained firm helped by foreign interest in Astra and Ericsson.
The Affarsvarlden general index rose 11.0 to 1,363.8, in turnover of
SKr1.4bn.
Ericsson B's added SKr2 to SKr434 helped by news that it had been awarded a
SKr1bn order to supply a mobile telephone network in Malaysia.

FT  13 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls 1.2% in an
otherwise strong region

SHARE prices tumbled in post holiday trading as selling hit component stocks
of the Nikkei 225 which had failed to be included into the new Nikkei 300
index, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 fell 241.33, or 1.2 per cent, to 20,137.31, having opened at
the day's high of 20,376.34 before tumbling to the day's low of 20,116.71.
Details of the new index were announced last Friday, but investors had been
unable to adjust positions on Monday because of a national holiday. Volume
was 226m shares against 318m.
Traders said that the gap between the Nikkei and Topix index was widening as
investors tried to shift from positions based on the Nikkei 225 to the
Nikkei 300. In contrast to the drop in the Nikkei, the Topix index, which is
a capitalisation weighted index of 1,233 stocks, only lost 4.14 to 1,652.26.
In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.24 to 1,283.66. Declines led
advances by 643 to 347, with 171 issues remaining unchanged.
The Osaka securities exchange is expected to list a new futures contract
based on the Nikkei 300 in January and traders said that index-related
selling was likely to continue for the rest of the week.
However, traders said that it was too early to forecast if the Nikkei 300
would become a new benchmark for the market, replacing the Nikkei 225. Mr
Chris Newton at James Capel said that the Topix index was becoming the
widely accepted index among many market participants.
Of the components of the Nikkei 225, 70 issues were not adopted for the new
capitalisation weighted index. Keisei Electric Railway fell Y50 to Y1,150,
Takara Shuzo lost Y30 to Y730, Hitachi Zosen fell Y18 to Y571, Japan
Airlines declined Y21 to Y723, and KDD retreated Y200 to Y12,400.
On the other hand, stocks included in the Nikkei 300 gained ground, with
Chudenko rising Y80 to Y4,150 and Takashimaya advancing Y10 to Y1,260.
Bando Chemical rose Y6 to Y688 on its development of a special chemical used
in copying machines which removes toner from paper.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 29.51 to 22,344.55 in volume of 11.9m shares.
Roundup
MANY Pacific Rim markets continued on their record setting ways.
SINGAPORE saw demand blue chips push equities to a record closing high in
choppy trading. The Straits Times Industrial index added 4.90 to 2,051.47
after an intraday peak of 2,062.33.
Analysts noted that foreign institutions are currently increasing their
weightings in a market whose capitalisation will be increased by at least 25
per cent, from the current SDollars 140bn, by the listing of Singapore
Telecom on November 1.
KUALA LUMPUR saw a surge in the shares of Telekom Malaysia and Tenaga
Nasional which drove the composite index through the 900 mark. The index
closed up 10.56 at a record 905.71, after an intraday peak of 912.74.
Telekom and Tenaga Nasional firmed MDollars 1.10 and 30 cents respectively
to MDollars 18.60 and MDollars 12.10.
MANILA was propelled to another record close by the strong showing of PDLT,
again building on its Wall Street performance. The composite index rose
67.30 to 2,093.83.
Strong foreign demand took PLDT 145 pesos higher to 1,665 pesos.
NEW ZEALAND built on a strong overnight performance by Telecom in New York
and the NZSE-40 capital share index closed 29.7, or 1.48 per cent higher at
2,039.78, its highest close since December of 1989. Telecom added 17 cents
to a record close of NZDollars 4.40.
TAIWAN closed higher in active trade after Monday's holiday. The composite
index ended 56.59, or 1.5 per cent higher at its intra-day high of 3,942.25.
SEOUL edged higher in moderate trading and the composite index added 1.48 to
723.57 as turnover climbed to Won553.8m from Monday's Won396.7m. Brokers
said that the market remained unaffected by the day's deadline for
identifying false-name financial accounts.
AUSTRALIA ended its nine-day rally as profit-taking left the All Ordinaries
index 11.8 lower at 2,028.0
BANGKOK succumbed to profit-taking triggered by heavy sales of Bangkok Bank
and some other large capitalisation issues, reversing an eight day bull run
which saw the market rise 16.3 per cent.
The SET index fell 21.78 or 1.9 per cent to 1,101.96 in turnover of
Bt16.12bn.
Bangkok Bank shed Bt5 to Bt148.

FT  13 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: Hong Kong climbs on a wall of US money
 -Simon Davies describes a contradictory couple of weeks for the equity
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Hong Kong stock market has acted in direct contrast to Sino-British
talks over the colony's political future in recent weeks, as a wall of US
money has flooded out local political and economic concerns.
Since September 27, the Hang Seng index has risen by 801, or 10.8 per cent,
to 8,253.45 in the face of a chain of seemingly negative news. Beijing lost
its bid for the 2,000 Olympics; the New York meeting between the British and
Chinese foreign ministers achieved nothing; and Governor Chris Patten has
shown no signs of withdrawing his political proposals in the face of
continuing Chinese opposition.
The reason for the disparity between local sentiment and the market
performance has been US mutual fund cash, and the growing assumption that
politics will do nothing to hurt the local economy.
A fortnight ago Mr Barton Biggs, Morgan Stanley's director of global
strategy, wrote: 'After eight days in China, I'm tuned in, over-fed and
maximum bullish.' He made no reference whatsoever to politics and advised a
substantial increase in Hong Kong weightings. US fund managers have
responded accordingly.
With its currency pegged to the US dollar, Hong Kong is seen as representing
an attractive option for cash rich US fund managers looking for high growth,
low valuations and limited currency risk.
Based on Goldman Sachs forecasts, the Hang Seng index is trading on a 1993
price earnings ratio of 15.2 and a 1994 p/e of 13, in spite of its 50 per
cent increase this year. By comparison, one of Asia's cheaper markets,
Thailand, is on 1993 and 1994 p/e's of 23.4, and 19 respectively. The colony
was previously deemed to be too much of a political risk, because of
Beijing; but as attitudes towards Chinese economic trends have changed, so
has the international perception of the stock market.
Mrs Janice Wallace, research director at Goldman Sachs Hong Kong, says: 'I'm
just overwhelmed by the liquidity flows. Obviously it can't go on forever,
but I can't see what the trigger will be'.
There are a number of such potential triggers. Concern remains over whether
China's austerity programme could take some of the strength out of the local
economy, which is already looking at declining corporate earnings growth in
both 1993 and 1994.
In the near-term, politics appears a more likely challenge to the US bulls.
On November 11, Mr Patten will visit the UK for what is likely to be a final
consultation with the UK government before proceeding with his proposals for
political reform, thereby putting an end to hopes for a peaceful compromise
with China.
The stock market is suggesting that politics will not impact on corporate
growth, but Chinese officials have already suggested that if Mr Patten goes
ahead with his proposals, the economy could suffer; this provides potential
for substantial mood swings. Other blows could be dealt by the death of the
ageing Chinese patriarch, Deng Xiaoping, or signs that the US may revoke
China's MFN status or impose specific trade tariffs as a means of extracting
improved human rights and a more open economy.
On the more positive side, China has still retained the two business trump
cards of its approval for Hong Kong's new airport, or its postponed
Container Terminal 9. Either card would give greater credence to the view
that China will not let politics hurt Hong Kong's economy, and would boost
the stock market. But Beijing has given no sign that such a gesture will be
forthcoming.
Analysts claim that much of the new money is coming into Hong Kong on the
basis that, in 45 months, it will be part of the fastest growing major
economy in the world - and that, on a long-term view, this will outweigh any
immediate concerns such as worsening Sino-British relations.
Mr Han Ong, managing director of Warburg Asset Management Hong Kong, says
that it is difficult to maintain caution in the face of this inflow of
funds. 'You can sit back and say there are any number of worries from a
fundamental point of view. But it is another thing to stand in the middle of
the road, say I'm right, and get run over by the juggernaut'.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Money Markets: Cash futures jump
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN, French and UK financial futures contracts jumped higher for the
first time in two weeks reflecting hope that lower interest rates might be
back on the agenda. writes Peter John.
The most heavily traded contracts for three-month money, those expiring in
December, all broke through recent trading ranges.
In the case of Germany, a decision by the Bundesbank to move from a fixed
14-day repurchase agreement to a variable repo prompted hopes that the
Bundesbank might be about to ease rates.
Liquidity is tight in Germany at the moment so the rate is likely to remain
at least at 6.7 per cent but could fall next week. German cash futures rose
6 basis points to 93.79 with 44,000 contracts traded.
Three-month franc futures traded on Liffe responded to comments by Mr Edmond
Alphandery, the French minister for the economy, that he saw signs of growth
in French economy. His remarks were taken as an indication that French
officials might be taking a softer line on monetary policy. The French
December contract leapt some 14 basis points by the official close and was
trading at 93.44 later.
The break-out for short sterling, on the other hand, gave rise to some
surprise in the money markets, The December contract has been stuck in a
tight range between 94.34 and 94.38 for a fortnight with few dealers
prepared to buy or sell and turnover lingering just above 10,000. Yesterday
saw the volume for December leap to more than 52,000 as the price lifted 9
basis points to 94.46 with no obvious spur driving it forward.
Some dealers suggested that a second assessment of Monday's economic data on
the trade gap and producer prices had led to a more optimistic view on lower
interest rates. However, most sterling observers are looking towards today's
retail prices index data.
A more plausible view appeared to be that a slight rise triggered a bout of
stop-loss buying, trading based on a contract hitting a pre-determined
level. That slight early gain was set off by easier than expected conditions
in the money markets.
At the start of the day's dealings the Bank of England forecast a liquidity
shortage of Pounds 1bn but most of that shortage was taken out when the Bank
bought Pounds 750m of bills at 5 29/32 per cent followed by a further Pounds
150m at 5 7/8 per cent. The forecast was later revised to Pounds 1.1bn and
an additional Pounds 214m of help provided which brought total assistance to
Pounds 1.114bn.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange: Unity relief masks ERM fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS, as they say, a game of two halves in the foreign exchange markets
yesterday. The turning point between nervousness and relief was marked by
the German ruling on the Maastricht Treaty, writes Peter John.
Dealers bought D-Marks first thing and sold rival currencies as a hedge
against the possibility that the German constitutional court would decide
that the Treaty on European Union was unconstitutional in its current form
and might ask for changes.
A negative vote was expected to throw concern over the exchange rate
mechanism into relief and sent European currencies except the D-Mark down
sharply; any vote to reject Maastricht would have given the German
authorities more freedom with economic policy.
The effect of the position taking was heightened by thin trading in the
aftermath of public holidays in Japan and the US on Monday and the D-Mark
rose against the Belgian Franc, the French Franc the dollar and sterling and
the Lira.
Then, at midday European time, the court announced that the Maastricht
Treaty on European Monetary and Economic Union was constitutional and in
accord with the country's democratic principles.
The few caveats were less exacting than feared but most of the hard hit
currencies only experienced short-lived gains.
Economists said the early selling reflected wider concerns over the European
exchange rate mechanism, which were beginning to resurface and the impending
court judgment was the catalyst.
Also, the D-Mark was held up by overseas buying of bunds as a shift to a
variable repo increased hope that interest rates might fall soon.
Sterling was down at DM2.4385 at one stage, within a whisker of a five-month
low reached at the end of September. It closed at DM2.4450, still a pfennig
down on balance.
The Belgian franc hit BFr21.81 at one stage and closed barely changed at
BFr21.77.
The French franc fell to a low of FFr3.5160 against the D-Mark and only
recovered to FFr3.5120. It was marginally higher than Monday's close of
FFr3.5140 but failed to be ignited by positive comments from Mr Edmond
Alphandery, the economy minister. The Italian lira hit L990.75 and clawed
its way back to L986.10 against the D-Mark up from L990.20.
Most surprisingly, the dollar failed to recover gain earlier weakness. It
reached a low of DM1.5935 before the judgment was given and bounced briefly
to DM1.6020 afterwards. Subsequently it drifted back again to close nearly a
cent lower in London at DM1.5960.
Mr Brian Hilliard at SGST, the French-owned securities house, said: 'The
disappointment for the dollar is that whenever there has been an opportunity
for a rally - first the Russian crisis and now this - it has failed to hang
on to its gains.'

FT  13 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Swedish gold miner aims to up
the stakes - A small but profitable business that is coming to market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE UNLIKELY site for Europe's largest gold mine is a place called Bjorkdal
only 300km south of the Arctic circle in northern Sweden.
Until now it has enjoyed an obscurity to match its remote location, but that
will change next month when the mine's operator, Terra Mining, comes to the
Swedish stock market, with a range of international institutions among its
new owners. The company says it will be Europe's only listed mining group
concerned purely with gold.
Bjorkdal claims its status as Europe's leading gold mine with 1992
production of 2,310kg (74,250 troy ounces) and expected output of 2,475kg
this year. Since it started production in 1988, total output has amounted to
9 tonnes.
On the scale of the world's biggest gold mines, such as those in South
Africa, this is insignificant, representing a mere one-tenth of 1 per cent
of total annual gold output worldwide.
But Terra Mining prides itself not on scale of production but on the
efficiency and profitability of its operations.
Its production costs are lower than 90 per cent of its western world rivals,
with mine site cash costs dropping to Dollars 145 an ounce in 1993 from
Dollars 209 last year.
The improvement will help the company to achieve a pre-tax profit of SKr71m
(Pounds 5.75m), a 35 per cent margin on sales of SKr202.3m and a level of
profitability that will match the very best in the Swedish corporate sector.
Part of the reason for the low cost base has been the dramatic strengthening
of the US dollar against the Swedish krona from an average of SKr5.83 in
1992 to SKr7.75 this year - a significant boost for a company that has
virtually all its expenses in krona and all its revenues in dollars. But it
is also lean in terms of staff numbers - it employs just 45 people - and it
has benefited from the efficiency of both its exploration and its mining
techniques.
The company prides itself on the effectiveness of its exploration technique,
which uses modern data-processing methods and an understanding of the
movement of glaciers during the last ice age to find commercial ore
deposits. Analysis of the glacial till, the layer of terrain that collected
small fragments of minerals as they were scraped off the underlying bedrock
by glaciers, is at the heart of the process.
Modern data processing allows huge numbers of deposits from many different
areas to be analysed systematically. In this way Terra Mining has tested
150,000 samples for 30 different elements (a total of 4.5m analyses) from a
grid covering nearly all of Sweden and parts of Finland, Norway and Ireland.
The company has spent SKr100m on exploration since it was founded in 1980,
and had spent only SKr30m by the time it identified the potential of
Bjorkdal in 1983. It took just five years from the moment a claim was first
lodged on the mine to the time production started - a short lead time by
industry standards.
The fact that the mine is open cast, rather than underground, helps to keep
operating costs down. It has also modified its mining methods, changing
bench height, blast size, and drilling patterns to enhance metallurgical
recovery. The result has been a steady improvement in the ore grade from
2.56 grams of gold a tonne in 1990 to 3.31 grams this year, although this is
still lower than a typical South African mine.
Further efficiency has been achieved by tripling the amount of ore treated
annually from 300,000 tonnes in 1988 to 900,000 tonnes today. The amount is
not likely to rise any further, as the company is restricted under the terms
of its concession to a maximum production of 1m tonnes of ore a year.
Even when the gold price plunged to the equivalent of SKr56,000 a kilogram
in July 1992 Bjorkdal remained profitable, with a break-even level of
SKr51,000. When the gold price soars to SKr107,000 a kilogram - as it did
this year, with a built-in benefit from the krona's devaluation - it is
highly profitable, and remains so at the SKr92,000 level which prevailed at
the end of September.
Perhaps Terra Mining's biggest problem, from a potential investor's
viewpoint, is that it has just one mine in operation at present, and one
with only seven years of proven and probable reserves at that.
The mine's president, Mr Torsten Borjemalm, is sensitive to this, but he
brushes the criticism aside. 'How many other industries have an order stock
of seven years? We know we have material to sell - it's only a question of
price,' he says.
Not only is the company confident that Bjorkdal's 'possible' reserves will
extend its life further, it also has 60 other prospects on its books and
expects to have at least one more mine, and possibly two, in operation by
the year 2000.
The most important exploration project is at Pahtavaara in Finland, which
has proven reserves of 695,000 tonnes at a grade of 3.33 grams a tonne. A
final decision on whether to develop this mine will be taken next year.
Another interesting deposit is at Barsele in Sweden.
It is partly because of the need to fund new mining developments that the
company and its owners now want to broaden Terra's ownership base when it is
listed. They will sell up to 1.3m shares at SKr140 a share. Norsk Hydro, the
majority shareholder with 61 per cent, is to sell about 30 per cent of its
stake as are the other two big shareholders, Euroventures Nordica and Mr
Christer Lofgren, one of the company's founders.
Presentations have been held in London, Paris, Stockholm and Edinburgh as
part of the campaign to attract new owners from the Swedish and
international investment community.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Supply fears drive up jute
prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PACE of advance in Indian raw jute prices in the current season, which
began in July, has raised concern that there will be further erosion in the
competitiveness of jute products against their substitutes, particularly
synthetic products.
According to officials of the Indian Jute Mills Association, jute products
will meet with consumer resistance both within and outside the country if
inflation in prices of the raw fibre is not checked. Raw jute accounts for
about 45 per cent of the cost of production of jute goods.
'If raw jute commands such high prices now when the new crop is arriving in
the market in volumes, then the supply situation will become particularly
critical from January onwards by which time the farmers will have largely
disposed of their stocks,' warn the IJMA officials. The benchmark W5 grade
of fibre is being traded at about Rs570 (Pounds 12) a quintal (100lb),
against Rs400 in the corresponding period of the previous season.
The IJMA has urged the federal government to allow 'free import' of raw jute
to keep the fibre prices in check. At present, the jute mills are allowed to
import fibre provided it is all used for the production of jute goods for
export. The IJMA has suggested the doing away with the 'export linkage of
raw jute import'.
According to industry officials, at least 1.2m bales (180 kg each) will have
to be imported this season (July-June) if India is to maintain jute goods
production at the normal level of about 1.3m tonnes and leave a reasonable
carry-over to 1994-95.
Unlike in the past, when only superior grades of jute were imported for the
production of high value jute items for export, in the current season, the
Indian industry will need to import the entire range of fibre. While
Bangladesh, backed by a crop of a little over 5m bales, will have a
comfortable export surplus, will be India's main source of import, the
industry thinks it can also import some fibre from Nepal and Thailand.
As jute prices in India are higher than in Bangladesh, there is no doubt
that a good quantity of Bangladeshi fibre will be smuggled into India along
the long unguarded border. According to the traders, jute smuggling, a
common occurence, could run at between 300,000 bales and 400,000 bales a
year.
Meanwhile, the industry has described the initial official crop forecast of
7.2m bales as 'totally unrealistic'. Not only will this season's jute crop
not be more than 6.5m bales, but the quality of a good portion of the jute
grown in Assam and parts of north Bengal has suffered because of the floods.
The Indian crop being short and the prices high, it is unlikely that the
Jute Commissioner's office will sanction exports in the current season even
though the merchant shippers are insisting that some export should be
allowed.
Even without any exports, it will not be easy to organise supplies of 8.5m
bales for the jute mills and 400,000 bales for use at village level.
Moreover, the next season needs to open with stocks equal to at least two
and a half months' fibre requirement to ensure smooth running of the mills.
Meanwhile, in the first four months of the financial year to next July,
India's exports of jute goods increased by 43 per cent to 73,000 tonnes,
compared with the same period of the previous year.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The GOLD price consolidated yesterday following Monday's move above Dollars
360 a troy ounce. At the London close it stood at Dollars 361.15 an ounce,
up 90 cents on the day. But analysts warned that the market was nervous and
lacked clear direction, making it just as likely to slip back as to continue
its current rally. At the London Metal Exchange COPPER prices surrendered
early gains and the three months delivery position closed at Dollars
1,703.25 a tonne, down Dollars 5.25 on the day. Copper looked to be finding
a range of between Dollars 1,680 and Dollars 1,720, dealers said, but
continued to encounter profit-taking and hedge selling on rises. LEAD prices
extended early gains as a breach of resistance at Dollars 395 a tonne
triggered stop-loss buying orders. The three months price closed up Dollars
24.75 at Dollars 413.50 a tonne. Dealers said consumer interest, trade
buying and short-covering had aided a recovery from the recent seven-year
low of Dollars 372. COCOA prices continued Monday's rally during the
morning, but in the absence of fundamental justification the gains were
erased in the afternoon.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME chairman in attack on
'malicious gossip'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SPIRITED defence of the London Metal Exchange's recent decision to
intervene in its copper market after widespread complaints that the price
was being manipulated upwards came last night from Mr Raj Bagri, the LME
chairman.
He said that mobility in international money markets and a massive increase
in options and other derivatives activity 'makes it comparatively easy or
tempting for one or more participants, individually or acting in concert, to
create in any free market like ours such dominant positions so as to result
in potentially undesirable situations or practices. We must be vigilant and
ready to deal with such situations as and when the need arises.'
Speaking at the LME's annual dinner, Mr Bagri suggested that some people,
'whose designs have been frustrated by firm actions of the LME board' might
indulge in 'malicious gossip'. But he urged anyone who genuinely believed
the board had acted with self-interested motives to furnish him with
substantiated evidence 'because I am keen to ensure that, like our market,
the LME board itself continues to meet the highest ethical standards'.
Mr Bagri insisted the board believed in free markets 'but we also have a
duty and obligation to run an orderly market and we are determined that the
confidence reposed by the overwhelming majority of the metals trade and
industry around the world in our reference prices continues to be justified
and that these prices continue to be transparently and independently
established without unwarranted distortions.'
Mr Douglas Yearley. chairman of Phelps Dodge, the biggest US copper
producer, said that, as a miner and producer of tangible material, he was
uneasy about the use of derivatives, some of which were like 'echoes of
shadows'. He said monitoring procedures could not keep pace with the fast
growth in derivative activity 'and leaves us open to the potential, at
least, of a meltdown'.
Mr Yearley also provocatively suggested that in a few years the
environmental movement would be more responsible for setting metal prices
than the LME. 'The environmental movement's power is growing and that power
is not going to be reversed in our lifetimes.'
The demand for pristine, rather than simply reasonable, environmental
standards 'is becoming a moral absolute in my country', he said.
The 'not in my backyard' attitude towards mining was growing into 'not in
your backyard either', he added, a change illustrated by the North American
Free Trade Agreement, signed in August, which spelled out the standards and
regulations on how Nafta countries must comply with environmental policy.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sri Lanka poised to regain tea
export lead after 1992 setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD COWPER

<DATELINE>
   COLOMBO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SRI LANKA is poised to regain its position as the world's largest exporter
of tea this year because of a strong recovery in output following a
disastrous drought in 1992.
According to the Sri Lankan Tea Commission, output in the first eight months
of 1993 was 149,300 tonnes, up 33 per cent on the same period of 1992.
Better weather and improved agricultural practices arising out of
quasi-privatisation of the country's 500 state-owned estates means that
output for the whole year is likely to reach about 225,000 tonnes, up 26 per
cent on last year.
In 1992, the most severe drought in decades drove output down to 178,000
tonnes, the lowest since 1956.
'Output will not be as high as the record 241,000 tonnes we produced in 1991
but it will be back to average levels of the last decade,' said Mr LG
Munasinghe, the country's Tea Commissioner.
He was optimistic that changes in field practices by the new estate
managements could push production up further next year, possibly to as much
as 250,000 tones.
Because Sri Lanka exports 90 per cent of its production, this year's sharp
increase in output has fed through to overseas sales. According to Mr T.
Sambasivam, deputy director-general of the Tea Board, Sri Lanka is certain
to replace India as the world's top exporter this year. It is expected to
ship about 205,000 tonnes for the whole year, up 15 per cent on 1992.
The Tea Board says exports in the first seven months of 1993 were 117,000
tonnes, up 17 per cent on the same period of 1992. Higher tea prices mean
the increase in value has been sharper. Exports in the first seven months
brought in Dollars 215m, up 20 per cent on the Dollars 179m earned in the
same period of 1992.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Jobs: How universities fared - Clear lead for Oxford in
graduate employment league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT'S like saying goodbye to an old fiend - by which is meant the
devilish-looking table to the right. Working it out has been a regular task
for the Jobs column's present writer every autumn since the era of
slide-rule calculations in 1972. As I'm due to retire in early February,
however, it will tax my number-crunching patience no more.
It nevertheless leaves me with twinges of regret, not least because along
the way it happens to have provoked a change in attitudes towards an
important item of public spending. The reason is that, while I had no such
intention on starting the exercise 21 years ago, the table turned out to be
the forefather of what are now called 'higher educational performance
indicators' and in use in various parts of the world. But I'd better choke
back the nostalgia for the moment, and explain what the figures are about.
The focus of the exercise is the United Kingdom's largely state-financed
campus universities - or at least the 45 of them which enjoyed university
status before the erstwhile polytechnics were elevated to the same title.
And the table's prime purpose is to show how the 45 institutions' new
graduates fared in the badly depressed jobs market of 1992.
The first column of figures sets out the total number of new bachelor-level
graduates domiciled in the UK, as distinct from those coming from overseas,
produced by each institution in the summer of last year. The second shows
the percentages of them who could no longer be traced by their Alma Mater on
December 31, six months after they gained their degree.
The next section of the chart, consisting of five columns, refers to the
1992 graduates whose whereabouts could be traced, beginning with the numbers
thereof. Then come four sets of percentages. The first denotes those who
obtained a job with long-term prospects, and the next those who continued in
full-time study or training. Both of those sets could be said to have found
regular occupations for their highly educated talents. But the other two
groups are different.
One is the people who declared themselves not available for employment at
all, as opposed to those who returned to some organisation which had kept
them on its books while they were at university. The other group, coming
last in the section, lumps together those who were unemployed at the
year-end and those who, although they'd obtained a job, were in only
temporary employment expected to last at most three months.
That Short-term work or jobless figure - which could be seen as a crude
gauge of the institutions' job-market performances in 1992 - was for years
the best measure I could produce. Alas it gave rise to academic protests
that it was unfair in making no allowance for variances in the mix of
subjects taught by different universities. After all, those with a large
proportion of engineers and the like in their graduate output have a
built-in advantage over those concentrating more on the arts side.
The snag was that, while little would have pleased me better than to adjust
for subject-mix, officialdom refused me access to the necessary detailed
data. So, considering the employability of expensively educated graduates a
matter of legitimate public interest, I just carried on on printing the only
measure I could produce.
Thanks to growing acceptance of the need for performance-indicators,
however, I can now do better. In the the past few years the university
authorities have taken to publishing management statistics allowing the
subject-mix adjustments to be made. But I still can't make them for 1992
alone, because the published figures are for three-year periods, in the
latest case for 1990-92.
Hence the final, three-column section of the table, on which the ranking of
the institutions is based. The first of the columns gives each of them a
'target' representing the number of its new graduates who would have been in
the short-term and jobless group if they'd conformed to the all-universities
average for their respective subjects. The next column shows the number
actually in that group, and the third shows the percentage by which the
actual score bettered or fell short of the target.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Survey of Italian Industry and Technology (10): Flexible and
resilient - Machine tools industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN SIMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY is the world's third-largest producer of machine tools, behind Japan
and Germany, but significantly it has only four companies among the 40
leading European manufacturers.
The flexibility provided by the relatively small size of Italian producers
has made them resilient, but by no means impervious, to the industry's
downturn.
World consumption of machine tools and manufacturing systems fell 21.1 per
cent to Dollars 31bn last year. Against that picture, Italian consumption
dropped 14.1 per cent at current prices in 1992 to L3,161bn.
A further, although more moderate, decline is being repeated this year, says
UCIMU, the association which represents 237 Italian machine tool makers
accounting for 70 per cent of sales. Orders in the second quarter were 5.9
per cent down on the same period in 1992.
The problems afflicting this sector, which is the thermometer of industrial
health, have been highlighted by a debt crisis at Mandelli, the
Piacenza-based factory automation group which occupies seventeenth place
among Europe's top 40, a list dominated by German manufacturers but led by
Comau, the Fiat subsidiary.
The indebtedness of Mandelli - whose present aversion to publicity contrasts
sharply with its attitude during the booming 1980s - springs from the
acquisition by the publicly-quoted group of five companies which were quick
to suffer from the downturn.
Now, Bankers Trust, heading 30 bank creditors, is considering a
restructuring plan for debts of L537.6bn which are more than twice the
group's turnover.
There would also be an injection of capital and the Mandelli family's
majority share stake would fall to 9 per cent.
The company believed it needed to reach a critical mass to compete on the
international stage but observers are sceptical that synergy is necessarily
achieved by Mandelli-style takeovers.
Italy has a very different ownership structure from that of Germany, its
main European competitor. While German groups on average had 265 employees
in 1991, Italian companies had 71.
The number of machine tool employees in Italy fell from 31,500 in 1991 to
29,230 last year (against Britain's 13,000). Nearly a third of Italian
companies had recourse last year to the 'cassa integrazione' system of
state-assisted short-term lay-offs but UCIMU says that only a tiny
proportion faces protection from creditors.
Mr Flavio Radice, UCIMU'S chairman, says: 'It's true the small size of
companies has helped them face the crisis. But we must be prepared for the
recovery, and to be small is not so good then.'
UCIMU is therefore pressing companies to collaborate in exports and, where
appropriate within Italy, to make a joint bid for a single order.
The organisation cites, as an example, a recent exhibition in Bologna where
forming machines of 14 companies combined to make a single saucepan
production line. This line was later sold.
The emphasis is on collaboration in Europe, too. This prompted UCIMU to host
a European-wide convention of manufacturers and customers at Cernobbio
earlier this month called 'Preparing Recovery'.
Italy maintained its place as the world's third-largest machine tool
exporter last year despite a 5.4 per cent fall in foreign sales to L2,012bn,
accounting for 48 per cent of production.
Two-thirds went to Europe but the star performance so far this year has
undoubtedly been exports to China, following a 1992 exhibition by Italian
companies in Beijing.
Sales to China in the first quarter were not far short of total sales there
in the whole of 1992, a result which has pushed China up from eighth place
as an overseas market to second, behind Germany.
The Italian export philosophy is to tailor high-quality products to a
client's need. 'We solve a client's problems, we don't sell a machine tool,'
says Mr Radice.
UCIMU is convinced that, bad as times are, manufacturers are continuing to
innovate. The Italian presence at last month's EMO machine tool fair in
Hanover was bigger than that of any other country, bearing witness to the
sector's innovation and flair.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Survey of Italian Industry and Technology (11): Salvation
through exports / Company profile of Rambaudi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN SIMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE managing director of Rambaudi sighs with relief when he recalls how the
Turin-based machine tool builder changed its business strategy to face up to
recession.
'With the domestic market as it is, you can imagine what our position would
have been if we had not taken the steps that we did,' says Mr Claudio
Piasenza.
The medium-sized builder of milling and boring machines and machining
centres is heavily dependent on mechanical industries at the forefront of
recession. Set up to serve the Turin motor industry, it makes die and mould
machines for the car market and also supplies the aircraft and energy
industries.
The group, founded in 1945 by Antonio Rambaudi - whose marble bust greets
the visitor in the foyer, along with an early milling machine - saw turnover
slip from a peak of L70bn to L52bn in 1991.
Sales by the group's four companies improved to L60bn in 1992 and the
company expects to break even this year, perhaps with a small profit in
1994.
The measures taken by Rambaudi were:
To widen the product range, while selling to the same markets.
To increase exports, which were already worldwide, in specific countries.
To collaborate with other producers to integrate products.
In the internal market, to cut jobs where products were of low added value
and to sub-contract some minor processes such as turning. The result is that
the group's 500-strong workforce will have been cut by about 20 per cent by
mid-1994.
One collaboration, agreed earlier this year, is with FMT of Brighton, in the
UK, which is one of the few surviving British-owned machine tool builders
competing technologically with the Japanese in flexible manufacturing
systems. The companies will market each other's complementary products -
Rambaudi's vertical spindle machines and FMT's horizontal spindle machines -
and work together on turnkey projects.
The real salvation of Rambaudi has come through exports. Devaluation of the
lira, says Mr Piasenza, has been a big bonus but the groundwork was laid
during the shift in strategy. A most important commercial decision was to
expand in China where Rambaudi, which has a representative office in
Beijing, is co-operating with Chinese companies on two manufacturing
projects.
Rambaudi also relaunched its activities in the US and Canada through an
agency in Rockford, Illinois. 'Results there were terrific in 1992,' says Mr
Piasenza.
The result of this push abroad has been that overseas sales have shot up
from 45-55 per cent of turnover to 75-85 per cent. A walk round the group
Ramco's subsidiary - which is being united with the main company to cut
overheads - reveals that only a handful of its big-dimension milling
machines are being made for the Italian market.
The group remains in the control of Bruno, Antonio's son, who is chairman,
and Franco, a cousin. 'We think a small and flexible structure is better,'
says Mr Piasenza. He acknowledges, however, that a small-scale operation can
also be weak, which is why Rambaudi has a sister company to tackle turnkey
projects.
When the recession lifts in machine tools Mr Piasenza expects exports to
fall back to about 60 per cent of sales. But hard times called for drastic
measures and he is convinced that it was Rambaudi's independence and
relatively small scale which enabled it to react so rapidly to market
changes.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Survey of Italian Industry and Technology (9): Fourth
generation retains control / Company profile of Barilla
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN SIMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE three sons of Pietro Barilla, Italy's pasta king who died last month,
have acted swiftly in an attempt to dispel any doubts about the succession
to control of the family-owned group.
The strategy remains the same, they pledge: to concentrate on two businesses
 -pasta and bakery products; remain the market leader within Italy in the
face of stiff foreign competition; and attack aggressively to increase pasta
sales in the rest of Europe. Barilla's pasta market share in the whole of
Europe is 22 per cent.
But which son is the first among princes? They are all equal, they insist,
and as token of their parity and solidarity they have decided to rotate the
chairmanship.
First it is the turn of Guido Maria, the oldest at 35 and the only married
son, who has worked in the business for 11 years. Then the baton will pass
to Luca, at present deputy chairman, and in turn to Paolo, a former Formula
One racing driver who has been made a director.
The term of each chairmanship has not been specified but will probably run
for five years, in line with the company's five-year plan which gets renewed
each year.
So in the medium term at any rate the Parma-based group remains in the hands
of the family, now in its fourth generation as pasta makers. Pietro Barilla
did sell the company in 1968 to W R Grace, the US multinational, but
immediately regretted selling his birthright. After lengthy negotiations he
bought the company back 11 years later.
'It is possible that in the long term other roads may have to be followed,'
says Mr Albino Ivardi Ganapini, who is assistant to the chairman. He
dismisses suggestions that a triumvirate might be a source of weakness and
says rotating the chairmanship is not an attempt to patch up difficulties.
'The brothers get on well together,' says Mr Ivardi Ganapini.
Visitors to the fortress-like Barilla headquarters at Pedrignano, on the
edge of Parma, pass through two security gates before reaching reception
where they key in personal details on a newly-installed electronic visitors'
book. Somewhere on the site, the size of a small town and dominated by a
15-floor tower, are paintings by De Chirico and Picasso - the late Pietro
Barilla was an art lover.
Despite the security, en route from town a taxi driver speaks warmly of
Pietro, a noted philanthropist whose funeral brought out the entire town in
mourning. 'He was a capitalist like all the others but good to his workers,'
is the driver's verdict. An engineering faculty for the University of Parma
was just one of his gifts.
Pietro's legacy was to build up Barilla into Italy's largest privately-owned
foods group with more than 8,000 workers. Recession has had only a moderate
effect on foodstuffs sales in the country and Barilla forecasts that the
group's turnover this year will be L3,700bn, compared with L3,327bn for
1992. After-tax profits are expected to be at the same level as the L140bn
last year.
Before turning his attention fully on expansion in Europe in 1990, Pietro
Barilla's strategy was first to take a strong hold on the domestic market.
Barilla now has 35 per cent of the domestic pasta market; well above the 8
per cent cornered by BSN, the French foods group. BSN is also trailing in
second place in bakery products, with 7 per cent of the Italian market
compared with Barilla's 36 per cent share. Barilla made a big advance in
this sector last year when it took majority control of Pavesi, the biscuit
manufacturer, from SME, the state-owned foods group. In January, it acquired
100 per cent.
Mr Ivardi Ganapini does not rule out further acquisitions to consolidate the
domestic presence but these would only be in bakery products or in pasta.
The threat from multinationals, Barilla believes, is best kept at bay by
concentrating narrowly on these products. After Pavesi, then, Barilla would
appear to have no more interest in privatisations.
As Mr Ivardi Ganapini says, however, 'resources are not infinite'. Barilla's
current focus is on increasing its presence in the rest of Europe in the
growing market for pasta and ready-made sauces - but with a different
strategy for northern Europe and the Mediterranean countries respectively.
In Greece and Spain, Barilla's approach has been to make acquisitions and
produce pasta - selling it under Greek and Spanish brand names. Barilla now
has 9 per cent of the Spanish pasta market and is the leader in Greece with
35 per cent.
In northern Europe, the strategy is to use the selling point of 'made in
Italy' and thus to sell Barilla brand names, exporting pasta from Parma. The
main assault so far has been in Germany and France - Barilla hopes to have
cornered 10 per cent of each country's pasta sales by 1997 - and in Sweden.
Steffi Graf, Gerard Depardieu and Stefan Edberg have all been recruited to
spearhead advertising in their respective countries.
Mr Ivardi Ganapini says Barilla is confident that the Parma plant, midway
between Milan and Bologna and the largest pasta factory in the world, can
keep its export markets supplied. Parma produces 45 per cent of the total
output from Barilla's eight pasta plants in Italy but the company is
investing in a new plant at Foggia, in the south, which will be used to
supply central Italy. Foggia is also near the raw material supply of durum
wheat in Puglia.
Mr Ivardi Ganapini concedes that a potential threat to Barilla's ambitions
lies in financing investment because the family has always eschewed stock
markets, preferring not to risk a clash with shareholders.
'But our strategy is in proportion to our resources,' says Mr Ivardi
Ganapini. 'Pietro Barilla developed the company strongly with his own
resources and we think we can do the same in the future.'

FT  13 OCT 93 / Survey of Italian Industry and Technology (8): Family firm
or public company - The future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WHAT we are facing in Italy', a senior industrialist says, 'is not just a
political change, but a management change.'
Scandals and corruption apart, Italian managers are wrestling with a nagging
problem: how to modernise the structure of Italian capitalism.
The challenge for Italian industry is how to evolve from the family firm to
the public company. Family control extends to some of the largest
enterprises in the country.
As many Italian managers are coming to realise, this has at least three big
drawbacks. It limits the supply of professional managerial talent from
outside the family: it hampers the development of an international business
culture: and it restricts the availability of finance for expansion.
In a few exceptional cases, these problems appear to be overcome.
Merloni Elettrodomestici, Europe's fourth-biggest maker of white goods such
as washing machines and refrigerators, is a truly international company with
factories in France, Portugal and Turkey and almost two thirds of its sales
outside Italy.
But although the company is publicly quoted, it is 75 per cent controlled by
the Merloni family.
Mr Vittorio Merloni, the chairman and founder, is reasonably sure he can
finance his ambitious growth targets without relinquishing family control.
But he concedes that he does not know what will happen beyond the end of the
decade.
And although he is surrounded by professional non-family managers, he also
concedes that attracting outside talent remains difficult.
Others put the point more bluntly. Dr Roberto Tronchetti Provera is
president of Camfin, an oil distribution and business services group which,
like Merloni, is publicly quoted but family controlled.
Speaking in his capacity as vice-chairman of Assolombarda, the powerful
northern employers' federation based in Milan, he insists that the move away
from family control is inevitable.
'If you want 51 per cent control of a company you will never grow', he says.
'You have to make a choice.'
Granted, he says, the old system served well enough in its day. 'In the
past, family ownership was a good thing. When you're building the industry
of a country, you need family ownership.
'Historically, that has been true everywhere. And you must realise that we
are a recent industrial country, certainly by comparison with Germany or the
UK.'
Now, however, industrialists such as Dr Tronchetti Provera are clearly irked
by the size limitation imposed by the family structure.
'If you compare quoted companies in Italy to those in France, Germany and
the UK', he says, 'the only big company we have is Fiat. A company like
Pirelli seems big to us, but it has only 10,000 employees.'
Mention of Pirelli is not, perhaps, wholly accidental. Through his family
company, Camfin, and in conjunction with his brother and fellow director,
Marco, Dr Tronchetti Provera is a sizeable shareholder in Pirelli.
Marco is also Pirelli's managing director.
And, as Roberto points out, as companies grow, so do families. 'Bringing
together 100 family members', he says, 'can be as difficult as bringing
together 10,000 shareholders.'
This is a live topic among Italy's bosses. According to another
industrialist - whose privately-owned metals company had a turnover last
year of Dollars 2bn - he and a number of like-minded patriarchs have regular
meetings several times a year.
'We discuss all these things', he says. 'How to keep control and expand; how
to keep other family members happy; whether to bring the daughters into
management'.
Dr Tronchetti Provera says: 'I don't think Italian families will continue to
dominate in the long term. But whether a company is run by family or
management doesn't matter to me as an investor.
'What matters is that the company is not run in the interests of a single
group. In any case, you can have a family company which is run very well,
like the Barilla group, or a non-family group which is run badly.'
The answer, he claims, is evolutionary.
'We are going through a period where control of the company will still be
very important, but not necessarily family control.'
What he has in mind is the French principle of the noyau dur - the hard core
of friendly and committed shareholders, controlling perhaps 15-30 per cent
of the shares, who will guarantee the company's independence.
This was precisely the tactic adopted by Fiat in its giant Dollars 3bn
fund-raising at the end of last month. As part of the exercise, Fiat brought
in as new core shareholders the French electronics giant Alcatel Alsthom and
the Italian insurer Generali, to add to a group already including such
European heavyweights as Deutsche Bank and the Italian merchant bank
Mediobanca.
The same tactic is also to be pursued in Italy's forthcoming privatisation
programme.
Here, too, Italy is following the French model whereby friendly groups of
core shareholders are assembled for each company before it is privatised.
The relevance of all this to humbler Italian family firms is in one sense
strictly limited. As recent stock market scandals have shown - in
particular, that of Ferruzzi, which culminated in the suicide of the
disgraced tycoon Raul Gardini - the Italian market is not for beginners.
Dr Tronchetti Provera says: 'Families are sceptical of the market because it
is not well organised and controlled. Solve that and the difficulty
disappears. Today, the system isn't working properly. All the Ferruzzi
problems happened without the control of the stock exchange authorities.
'Without an institution such as the Securities and Exchange Commission in
the US, you will never have a market.
'But I think we will have a reasonable working stock market two or three
years from now. As an association of industrialists, we very strongly
request clear rules and efficiency in the market's controlling body. This is
the only way to allow the development of Italian industry.
'You need clear rules so that new companies coming to the market know what
to expect, and new shareholders as well.'

FT  13 OCT 93 / Survey of Italian Industry and Technology (7): Cash flow is
the main problem - Furniture industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN SIMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOREDANA SARTI says she was convinced the Italian furniture industry could
fail at any minute when she joined the Milan-based employers' organisation,
Federlegno-Arredo, as an economist some 15 years ago.
'I kept trying to explain the miracle of its survival,' she said. 'It had no
logic, as it is based on small, family-owned companies without access to
capital. But the logic is that these continue to invest in bad times,
renouncing profits.'
That remains largely true of Italy's 35,000 furniture companies - only 4,500
of which have more than 15 employees - when the industry is suffering a 4.2
per cent fall in production, according to Federlegno figures for the first
five months of 1993.
The independent CSIL institute in Milan, which monitors the furniture
industry and whose forecasts are much respected, predicts a 5 per cent fall
for the whole year because of the contraction of the domestic market.
'We have done everything we can to hang on, but it is undeniable it is not
an easy time,' says Ms Sarti, pointing out that new kitchens and three-piece
suites slip lower down a family's shopping list during a recession. She
estimates, however, that only one company in a thousand is going out of
business and says that cash flow, rather than lower sales, is the biggest
problem, with long delays in settling bills.
But relief is provided by exports for which all the familiar winning cards
of Italian manufacturing have come into play. Design flair and an emphasis
on high-quality, customised products have turned Italy into the world's
leading furniture exporter, overtaking Germany five years ago. In fact 33
per cent of Italy's sales are to overseas customers, mostly within the EC.
The devaluation of the lira helps to explain the 16.3 per cent rise in
first-quarter exports reported by Federlegno for this year but this will be
countered by the higher cost of imported raw materials, 80 per cent of which
come from abroad.
On a turnover of L24,000bn in 1992, exports of L8,300bn dwarfed imports of
L790bn. Although Italian industry in general began to lose ground during the
second half of 1990, the minimal impact of furniture imports on the domestic
market meant that sales held up well until the latter half of last year. In
fact, turnover increased slightly last year, from L21,000bn in 1991.
The sector hit hardest in the domestic market has been office furniture,
which accounts for 10 per cent of production, partly because businesses are
saving costs on fittings and also because the 'Tangentopoli' bribes scandal
has brought public sector projects largely to a standstill.
A total of 180,000 workers are employed in making household and office
furniture. The industry, betraying its artisan roots, is grouped in four
geographical areas and dominated by second or third generation, family-owned
companies.
There is the Brianza district in Lombardy, stretching from north Milan to
Lake Como. Another formidable cluster is in the Veneto, with chair
production based on Udine, while kitchen furniture features prominently in
the third area, Tuscany. Pesaro on the Adriatic provides the fourth group
and exports heavily to the Middle East.
Family ownership still dominates even the big companies. But this year,
Natuzzi, Italy's leading maker of leather furniture, surprised its rivals by
floating part of its shares on the New York Stock Exchange. With a turnover
of more than L300bn and 1,700 workers, it is unusual in that it is based in
the south, at Bari in Puglia. Partly because of its isolation it has
developed a vertically-integrated structure, allowing start-to-finish
production of its upholstery.
Another rare case among the big companies is the Brianza upholsterer,
Cassina, which has been taken over by a foreign concern - Strafor, the
European arm of Steelcase of the US.
The fragmented nature of the industry does prompt concern. 'I think the pace
of concentration could and should be quicker,' says Mr Mino Politi of CSIL.
Federlegno is of the same view and believes the industry is moving in this
direction: in the Veneto, for example, several companies have come under the
umbrella of a holding company, Arc Linea Arredamenti.
This fragmentation is reflected in a poor distribution network, which is
perhaps the industry's main weakness. A multitude of dealers supply 25,000
retail outlets, but chains such as Ikea of Sweden are beginning to enter the
market.
Greater concentration of outlets with guarantees of high quality products
and good after-sales service, as in the toys and electric goods markets,
cannot come too quickly as far as Mr Aldo Alberti is concerned. His company,
Alberti, manufactures kitchens at Bovisio Masciago, a village in the heart
of the Brianza. 'In Brianza we have paid too much attention to the product
and not enough to the structure of the business,' he says. 'We need more
than a good product; we need synergy.'
Mr Alberti and his two brothers have developed the company started by their
father into a high-quality kitchen manufacturer with 20 workers and a
turnover of L4.5bn. Innovative products such as one-piece mini-kitchens have
built up their exports since the late-1980s to 25 per cent of sales.
Devaluation has not aided them greatly, he says, because quality and design
are more relevant to their output than price. But this year the company has
still unveiled new products and is refurbishing the factory. 'In moments of
crisis I believe you have to support the business with extraordinary
measures,' he says. 'Either you reduce investment or you put your hand in
your pocket, taking savings and using profits.'
The same philosophy guides one of the top players, B&amp;B Italia, which is also
in the Brianza and has 500 workers. Run by the Busnelli family, it expects
to increase 1992 turnover of L155bn to L210bn this year.
'Thanks to the competitive lira we have managed to cover the fall in
domestic demand with exports,' says Mr Giorgio Busnelli, managing director.
Besides office furniture and a wide range of household products, B&amp;B Italia
has a marine division, fitting out ships, which is performing strongly.
The previous high interest rates have forced the company to plough back
profits, rather than borrow, when it comes to investment. But as a big group
with fixed costs, including 14 managers and 25 research staff, 'we can't
follow a policy of staying at home, with no more investment or advertising,'
says Mr Busnelli. 'The only way to survive is to invest.'
Flexibility and family ownership, as demonstrated by Alberti and B&amp;B Italia,
will remain key characteristics of furniture-making for some time to come.
But this is a relatively young industry and greater concentration is sure to
follow.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Survey of Italian Industry and Technology (6): Shift towards
bigger units - Small businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN SIMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOWER labour costs and a fall in interest rates are bringing some relief to
the small and medium-sized companies which form the backbone of Italian
industry. But recession is taxing their stamina, particularly if they depend
largely on the domestic market, as in construction.
There are also signs of a long-term shift in the ownership pattern towards
larger units. The grip of the traditional padre-padrone, the boss of the
family firm, may be weakening.
Ninety per cent of member companies of Confindustria, the employers'
association, have fewer than 100 workers and this patchwork of small
enterprises is still acclaimed for its flexibility in adapting swiftly to
market changes. However, Mr Alessandro Cassinis of Censis, the leading
economic research and social institute, says that over the past five years
the growth rate in the number of enterprises has slowed. In the north, the
number itself has fallen over the past two years.
As an indication of a trend to larger companies, says Mr Cassinis, in the
first half of this year in Italy there was a 2.3 per cent rise in a category
of company likely to be medium-sized. In contrast there was a 3 per cent
fall in a class of small businesses likely to have only 10 to 15 workers.
There are several reasons why entrepreneurs should think twice about setting
up small enterprises. Cuts in state assistance, the complexity of European
Community regulations and heavy business taxes are all factors. The efforts
involved in marketing products abroad also weigh heavily on independent
operators.
There has been uproar, too, over a minimum tax on income introduced in the
1993 budget to clamp down on tax evasion, for which the self-employed and
small businesses are considered chiefly responsible. The government imposed
an extremely unpopular formula whereby it evolved computer models for
assessing minimum declared income in every category.
The system will almost certainly be modified but the government will not
renounce its aim of bringing people within the tax net. Before the minimum
tax was introduced a survey revealed that some small business employers were
declaring income lower than that of their employees.
There are also pressures, however, favouring a status quo in industrial
structure. The current tax regime, for example, is not merger friendly:
entrepreneurs run the risk of high added-value tax if a company's value
increases.
There is also a strong cultural preference still for the family-owned
business in many sectors, notably textiles, machine tools, footwear and
furniture. But Mr Cassinis believes that even in these areas commercial
pressures and problems of succession, where a father has two or more sons,
will erode the traditional set-up.
The present performance of small and medium-sized enterprises, as recession
continues, is a story of those that have and of those that have not - the
golden spoon in this case being exports.
Confindustria says that in the first half of this year, while there was a
sharp contraction in the domestic market, exports grew 10 per cent on a
weaker lira. 'Unfortunately only a few small businessmen are exporters,'
says Mr Giorgio Fossa, the association's vice-chairman who superintends
small and medium-sized companies. 'So we find a small slice of business
doing very well while the big majority is tied to the domestic market and
suffering a lot.'
He adds that small businesses, acting as sub-contractors, have paid a high
price on account of the 'Tangentopoli' bribes scandal which has brought
public works projects practically to a standstill. The investigations have
blocked orders and delayed payments. 'The long delay in payments, which is
chronic in our country, has been aggravated by 'Tangentopoli',' says Mr
Fossa.
In the battle against unemployment, he calls for pay rises to be kept in
line with the inflation rate, presently about 4 per cent. He says
unemployment must be tackled in terms of new stimuli for industry and is
looking for relief in the tax burden on business as the budget deficit is
brought under control.
The government's fiscal policy with regard to small businesses is certainly
going to be crucial in encouraging expansion. Confindustria calculates that
the total weight of taxation on business is about 60 per cent. 'Right now we
definitely have the highest fiscal rate in Europe,' says Mr Fossa, arguing
that a lighter burden would not only encourage more investment but reduce
tax evasion.
Another deep-seated weakness is that small enterprises have not been able to
tap the stock market and other financial markets for financing. Much of the
credit is short-term and Mr Fossa is severely critical of the high interest
rates charged on bank loans.
Many banks maintain a gap of four to five points between the central bank's
key lending rate and the rates charged for small businesses. This springs
from the banks' inefficiency, he maintains. 'Banks must reorganise
themselves and reduce this gap.'
An average interest rate for small businesses of about 13 per cent, when
inflation is at 4 per cent, does little to improve the business community's
generally poor opinion of banks - as articulated by a Milan builder,
specialising in house renovation, who has a workforce of 18 and an annual
turnover of L2bn. He says his bank only reluctantly raised his overdraft
limit from L25m to L60m even though he had no debts and could prove client
payments due to him of L700m. 'How can I work with a bank like that?' he
says.
Mr Roberto Brambilla, deputy general manager of Cariplo, Italy's
third-largest bank, is well aware of public criticism but says that support
for businesses is not just a question of handing out money: the lender must
assess the business and give short-term and long-term assistance in
accordance with cashflow and investment needs.
Eighty per cent of Cariplo's business loans are to small and medium-sized
concerns and Mr Brambilla says the bank's interest rates are about a point
below the average charged. He says there is an increase in potential bad
debts from small businesses, making 1993 the worst year in a decade.
In 1992, Cariplo had debt provision representing 3.7 per cent of total
loans, compared with an average of 5.7 per cent for the banking system. But
Mr Brambilla adds that small businesses have shown great resilience.
'I don't think that you have to be big to be well placed in the market,' he
says.
Mr Fossa also sees advantages of flexibility in small companies. 'But this
gives us enormous problems from the point of view of capital,' he says. He
is looking for companies to increase technological and marketing
collaboration with EC counterparts, so that Italian companies become not
merely exporters but take on a deeper international presence.
He will also press the government for easier access to risk capital.
The Bank of Italy has recently ended its ban on banks taking stakes in
companies and Cariplo, for one, intends through its merchant banking arm to
investigate how to help small businesses approach the stock market.
This new freedom would be best used to encourage more venture capital among
small companies but it is possible that the lion's share of bank stakes will
be taken up in the cause of bigger companies, often using debt-swap deals.
The move offers at least a glimmer of hope that a more comprehensive system
of credit will emerge, but it is early days.
In the meantime, small companies are left hoping that the promised upturn in
1994 will restore their own profitability.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Survey of Italian Industry and Technology (5): Job cuts
could trigger social unrest - Steel industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE next three months could be decisive for Ilva, Italy's state-owned steel
group, and for thousands of jobs in the south where most steel is made.
The prognosis is for a bleak Christmas at Taranto, the country's biggest
integrated steelworks, and at most of the other facilities where Ilva is
based. With chronic losses, over-capacity and a running row with the
European Commission in Brussels, tough measures in the form of job cuts and
plant closures looks inevitable.
That could trigger a new round of social unrest in an already volatile
environment. Workers at Taranto blockaded crucial parts of the vast plant
last month in a foretaste of what might take place if rationalisation has to
be pushed through in earnest in an area of already very high unemployment.
Everything will hinge on the outcome of talks between the Italians,
represented by Ilva, the IRI state holding company which owns it, and the
Rome government, and the Commission. After several exchanges of fire earlier
this year, the final reckoning looks set to be dramatic.
At stake is the credibility of the Commission's programme to reduce
steelmaking in the Community on one hand and the risk of thousands of
redundancies in southern Italy on the other. With the Italian economy in
recession, the contents and presentation of the plan could also be the touch
paper which could ignite a series of other, potentially explosive, labour
disputes simmering at loss-making state enterprises.
The latest Ilva restructuring plan will be the third in 1993. Each has
represented a significant watering down of its predecessor, although none
have so far met with the Commission's approval.
The row began earlier this year when Mr Hayao Nakamura, Ilva's managing
director, hired from Nippon Steel, proclaimed that the company set little
store by the Commission's call for capacity cuts and an end to state
subsidies. Insisting that Ilva was independent of the state - its parent,
IRI, was turned into a joint stock company last year - Mr Nakamura argued
that Europe's steel crisis would best be solved by a 'gentleman's agreement'
between leading producers. Events overtook him with the arrival of Mr Romano
Prodi as IRI's new chairman. The earlier plan had to be rewritten and a new
stress was placed on privatisation to reduce Ilva's burden on its parent
company.
Subsequent amendments resulted in the most recent proposal. This involves
splitting Ilva into two separate companies. One would specialise in flat
laminates - based on the big Taranto and Novi Ligure works - while the
second would concentrate on stainless steels, produced at the group's plant
at Terni in Umbia. IRI has even given mandates to two merchant banks,
Italy's IMI group and Barclays of the UK, to put forward privatisation plans
for the two operations. Separately, Dalmine, the big seamless tubes group in
which Ilva is the biggest shareholder, seems destined for privatisation via
either a share flotation or the sale of Ilva's majority stake to a leading
European steelmaker.
The new plan also backtracked notably on the issue of how to deal with
Ilva's huge debts, which amounted to L7,583bn at the end of last year. While
the original proposal implied the bulk of the debt would be assumed by IRI,
along with any surplus plant that could not sold, the new proposal mollified
Commission objections by including an appreciably lower debt transfer to the
parent company. The revision was partly dictated by IRI's new management
which, facing about L73,000bn in group debts, is determined to reduce
borrowings.
The dispute with the Commission has only exacerbated an already very
difficult situation for the Rome government. Ilva's losses, which amounted
to L2,309bn last year, will remain extremely high this year because of the
recession and continuing weakness in the prices of many products.
Earlier this year, Mr Nakamura said he hoped the company would contain its
1993 loss to L1,500bn. In August, however, Mr Piero Barucci, the treasury
minister, said losses would be about L2,000bn. He added that Ilva's
consolidated debts had fallen only marginally in the first six months of
this year, to stand at about L7,500bn by the end of June. Since then has
come the protest at Taranto which, although resolved relatively quickly,
cost the group billions of lire in lost production.
Negotiations are believed to be under way for the disposal of several Ilva
assets. The two merchant banks given the privatisation mandates are studying
a range of options. These include a full or partial sale to some leading
private-sector Italian steelmakers who have at various times expressed an
interest in taking a stake in specific plant. Most recently, attention has
focused on selling Ilva's shipping operation.
Yet all the options face drawbacks. The problem is that even Italy's once
ebullient private steel groups are facing hard times. Cremona-based Arvedi
group is in negotiations with its bankers on restructuring its debts,
believed to be well over L1,000bn. Falck, the Milan-based company, is in
loss and recently faced the additional burden of seeing some of its
management put under investigation over alleged political corruption.
Meanwhile both Luigi Lucchini and Steno Marcegaglia, two of Italy's best
known private steel producers, who have expressed interest in both the
Taranto and Terni works, are proceeding with extreme caution given the
economic climate.
The Commission is also under considerable pressure, notably from British
Steel in the UK and the leading German steel groups, to be uncompromising
with Ilva.
The issue of Italian state aid - not just to steel, but also to other IRI
subsidiaries - is highly contentious. However, Commission officials may
prefer to negotiate a workable compromise they believe will be observed and
can stick, rather than hold out for a harsher agreement which might either
run the risk of not being respected fully or provoke such civil strife in
Italy as to become a political non-starter.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Survey of Italian Industry and Technology (4): The spotlight
has shifted - Design
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASK any German, French or British industrialist what are the most important
characteristics of their Italian competitors, and the chances are that good
design will feature as prominently as price and quality.
The post-war success of Italian industry, especially in exports, has been
intimately linked to innovative design. Often, Italian manufacturers have
shaped taste, steering consumers towards products which may have offered
little advance on their rivals technologically but beat them hands down on
design.
From furniture to freezers, cars to computers, Italian goods have gained a
competitive edge against their foreign rivals through good design. While
far-sighted company executives and a traditional stress on fine arts in
education have been crucial influences, the existence of a cadre of gifted
industrial designers in Italy has been essential to fulfil manufacturers'
briefs.
In recent years, items such as Alessi's shiny stainless steel cookware or
the slinky matt-black Tizio desk lamp made by Artemide have become
international symbols of 'design consciousness' among consumers.
But the ubiquity of Italian design is not limited to expensive yuppie
products such as desk lamps. Back in the 1950s and 1960s, architects such as
Ettore Sottsass, now best known for his Memphis design movement, turned
their hands to utilitarian items such as filing cabinets or typewriters.
Today, their output features as prominently in international design museums
as the trendier outpourings of their successors.
However, many observers feel that Italian design has lost momentum and with
it the international leadership it commanded as recently as the early 1980s.
The message that design matters as much as keen pricing and quality
manufacturing has caught on abroad. With many foreign companies now as
design conscious as their Italian counterparts, has Italian industry lost
one of its biggest competitive advantages?
Mr Mario Trimarchi, director of the Master in Industrial Design course at
Milan's Domus Academy of design, prefers to avoid confrontational terms.
'The design industry has internationalised immeasurably,' he says, 'and
positions of national leadership are no longer so important'.
He gives two reasons why the spotlight has shifted from Italy in the past
decade. First, the study and teaching of design has developed at a number of
international centres, apart from Milan, its traditional cradle.
Among schools now prominent alongside Domus are the Cranbrook Academy, the
Pasadena Art Centre and the Illiois Institute of Technology in the US and a
variety of company-based design centres in Japan. Pure industrial design
remains the credo at a number of top German design schools, while the UK's
Royal College of Art is a magnet for students wanting a broader training in
design and the fine arts.
Secondly, issues in international design have moved on, says Mr Trimarchi.
'Ten years ago, Italy was at the forefront of renewing the language of
domestic design.' Designers born or trained in Italy were spearheading a
revolution in fashion, furniture and a stream of household products ranging
from lavatory brushes to linoleum.
Their ideas had worldwide repercussions. But now, new concerns have taken
over. Ecological awareness and the correct use of materials from an
environmental point of view is foremost among them. In the 1990s, the nature
of materials has become almost as important to designers as to craft them.
The new testing grounds for future design trends are also in industries
where Italian companies are relatively weak. Rather than fashion or
furniture, consumer electronics and computers are now the focal point for
determining industrial design trends, Mr Trimarchi believes.
With consumer durables playing an increasingly important role in every
household, and technological innovations coming thick and fast, designing
the latest 'black boxes' has moved into the forefront. So far, neither the
US, Japan nor Europe has gained a clear lead, he says.
Design-conscious Italian companies are aware of the challenges. At Artemide,
the Lombardy-based lighting group owned and run by Mr Ernesto Gismondi, a
former professor of missile technology at the Milan Polytechnic, the stress
is now on products which marry attractive design to energy efficiency.
'The emphasis has moved on', says Mr Gismondi, whose company, established in
1960, reached international fame after the Tizio lamp, designed by
international design guru Richard Sapper in 1972, started to catch on.
Sales of the Tizio have started to fall off from their late 1980s peak, in a
telling indication of the change in tastes and emphasis, notes Mr Gismondi.
Leading the visitor into his spartan office, he gives a glimpse of the
future. Gone are the high-powered halogen lamps of the 1980s which, although
easier on electricity than a traditional filament bulb, still consume
prodigious amounts of energy. Instead, Artemide's latest product is a
stylish uplighter which uses compact fluorescent bulbs to produce as much
light as a halogen lamp at a fraction of the cost in terms of power
consumption.
The new product has been designed by Mr Gismondi himself, rather than by one
of the outside design studios which do most of the work for Artemide. But
although the issues in international design may have moved on since Italy's
heyday, Italian companies can still call on a huge pool of talent on their
doorsteps.
Milan remains one of the world's design Meccas thanks to the concentration
of leading designers who work there. Its role has been reinforced by the
10-year-old Domus Academy, which pulls in some of the best young students,
many of whom then seek jobs at the Milan studios.
The school only takes about 30 postgraduates a year for its masters' degree
in design and about 25 for a similar qualification in fashion - and
therefore competition is fierce despite steep tuition fees of L21m excluding
tax.
However, the range of nationalities who apply gives some comfort to those
who fear Milan may be losing its place as a design centre. About 90 per cent
of the students come from abroad, says Mr Emilio Genovesi, Domus's executive
director. While many return home to set up their own studios or, in the case
of the heavy Japanese contingent, rejoin their sponsor companies, some stay
in Milan to gain experience with local studios.
'Milan remains one of the most fertile meeting places for international
designers', says Mr Genovesi. 'The fact that English is the common language
reflects the mix of people who congregate here'.
Other cities, such as Tokyo, Dusseldorf or Barcelona, may offer a
concentration of manufacturing industry and designers working closely
together. But none can match Milan for the breadth of backgrounds and
cultures among its designers, he thinks.
For a company such as Artemide, typical of hundreds of small, highly
design-conscious Italian manufacturers, that vitality is a positive sign.
Whatever the improvements in design taking place among their foreign
competitors, it suggests they will be able to keep up with the pack, if not
remain ahead, in future.

sector-by-sector guide - Industry round-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<TEXT>
Aerospace: The worldwide downturn in civil and military orders continues to
be felt on the main group, state-controlled Alenia, which approved a
restructuring plan earlier in the year after strong union resistance.
Alenia has warded off threats from McDonnell Douglas to end long-standing
contracts, but orders for a French venture on regional turbo transport have
been slower than expected.
On the military side, the cut-backs and reworking of the Eurofighter project
are being felt. But the Italian Air Force may yet boost local industry
through lease-purchase of a stop-gap, all-purpose fighter aircraft before
the Eurofighter comes into service.
Automotive industry: The sector remains depressed, operating at 75 per cent
capacity as a result of the drop in international demand and recession at
home.
Production and sales are expected to be down at least 20 per cent this year,
forcing Fiat to raise L6,000bn in capital to offset present and future
losses. If demand continues at present levels beyond the first quarter of
1994, plant closures could become a real issue.
Focus is on the success of Fiat's 10-year L40,000bn investment programme
whose first fruit was the Punto launch in September from the new Melfi
plant. Chemicals and Fertilisers: The industry is awaiting plans for
reorganisation of Enichem, chemicals arm of ENI, the state oil concern. With
first-half losses of L1,000bn, major surgery is anticipated, especially
where old plant is concerned and in uneconomic fertiliser production. ENI
itself has forged ties with BP.
In the private sector, Montedison's reasonable performance in specialised
sectors has been overshadowed by the collapse of the controlling Ferruzzi
family group. The resolution of the Ferruzzi mess could lead to asset sales
including the high-technology US arm, Himont, in which Shell has shown an
interest.
Civil Engineering: Depressed domestic demand and cuts in government spending
have forced companies to turn overseas for a higher proportion of work.
Lira devaluation has led to successful bids on a string of contracts,
especially in the Middle East - the Ansaldo desalination projects, for
example - and also in new markets such as China, as well in mature markets
such as the UK.
Construction is among the worst-affected sectors, feeling the triple blasts
of domestic recession, freezes on government spending and troubles produced
by the corruption scandals that have halted as much as 25 per cent of all
public works contracts for varying periods during the year.
Ownership structures could change with Fiat hinting at the sale of
Cogefar-Impresit, its construction arm. State-run Iritecna's fate is also
unclear.
Defence: There has been enforced reorganisation as a result of the
liquidation of Efim, the state industrial holding, in August 1992.
Augusta (helicopters), and the armoured vehicles, ordinance and weapons
producers Breda and Oto Melara are moving from Efim to rationalise state
holdings under Finmeccanica. But Finmeccanica is reluctant to absorb their
debt. The reorganisation must reflect a drop of almost one third in overall
sales and Italy's declining ability to sustain substantial defence
investments.
Informatics and office equipment: Olivetti raised L900bn in a rights issue
early in the year to help offset losses and fight fierce international
competition. Rumours of an impending Olivetti international alliance are
constant but have yet to materialise.
In 1994, for the second year running, the information technology market in
Italy is forecast to grow at only about half the rate of European growth:
some 2.4 per cent.
Machine tools: This is a traditional area of strength, especially in
establishing market niches for specialised machine tools.
Production fell 13 per cent in the first half of 1993. But this conceals the
way in which a dramatic drop in domestic demand has been offset by an
impressive switch to export orders. But the boost from the lira devaluation
masks whether production costs have fallen sufficiently and innovation is
being sustained.
Shipbuilding: The sector is dominated by state-run Fincantieri which is in
the process of rationalisation. The workforce is due to be reduced by almost
a quarter to cut over-capacity on both the civil and military side, and
gradual hiving off of the repairs division to the private sector. Good
orders have been won in the promising cruise market.
Although the group's finances remain weak, a burden has been lifted by
settlement of the long-standing issue of Iraqi naval vessels which were
built but whose delivery was embargoed.
Steel: This is the industry which faces the biggest immediate shake-up as
subsidies are cut and the EC obliges capacity reductions at state-run Ilva.
This is to be achieved by breaking up Ilva and privatising, with the threat
of 15,000 jobs lost between 1993 and 1995 in primary steel production.
Telecommunications: The government has approved a shake-up of the
state-controlled sector moving towards a telecoms authority and separation
of the manufacturing side (Italtel - equipment manufacture; Sirti - network
engineering).
Despite the potential demand for new services, telephone investments by Sip,
the main telephones company, have been lower than planned this year and
could follow a similar pattern next year. The sector, heavily dependent on
the Italian market, is unlikely to have a much-needed boost until
privatisation plans are clarified.
Textiles: Tough competition from low-cost producers in developing countries
continue to impact negatively on the lower and middle end of the market. The
top end has felt the squeeze from a drop in demand among rich consumers,
although where the lira devaluation has given a competitive advantage, such
as in Germany and France, market shares have been increased. The sector
needs to see more mergers or co-operative ventures among the small- and
medium-sized companies to consolidate the future.
White Goods: This has been one of the few sectors to buck the trend and,
despite slack domestic demand, production increased 3 per cent in the first
half. Zanussi and Merloni have both been pressing for more flexible working
and production schedules. In this context, Merloni in July chalked up a
landmark productivity-related union agreement. The company has also been
aggressive in seeking production opportunities overseas, such as Turkey.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Survey of Italian Industry and Technology (2): Symbol of
hope in a time of despair - The South
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MELFI this autumn has been become the symbol of hope for the industrial
resurgence of southern Italy.
In record time, a greenfield site worked as agricultural land for centuries
has been transformed into Italy's most modern industrial plant by Fiat. The
Turin-based vehicle group started production in September of the Punto - the
new model which Fiat hopes can claw back its declining share of the world
car market.
Yet the evidence of neglect and despair is widespread. The other, bleaker,
side to southern industry has been the wave of labour unrest protesting job
losses and threats to employment. At Crotone last month, workers at Enichem,
the chemicals arm of ENI, the state oil concern, burned chemical drums and
blocked the road and railways for 10 days.
At Taranto, further south, 170 desperate workers employed by a
sub-contractor, chained themselves to the installations of Ilva, the state
steel producer. For five days, they nearly brought production at Europe's
largest steel complex to a halt.
Elsewhere, at Goia Tauro, the railway line was blocked for fifth time this
year by workers and their families protesting over the failure to find a
future for an area earmarked in the seventies to host a giant steel plant.
Today, Goia Tauro contains a port and four kilometres of quays all unused,
and once fertile land has been covered by highways that lead nowhere but
which awaited an industrial park.
The L4,600bn Fiat plant at Melfi is a bold attempt to prove that industrial
investment can be made to work in the south, despite the poor
communications, the distance from core European markets and the record of
low productivity of southern labour.
Fiat's choice of a Melfi was in part the result of generous government
grants and subsidies - all approved by the EC. This, combined with lower
costs than the north, made Melfi an attractive, if not an inevitable choice
compared to other greenfield sites elsewhere in Europe. With automotive
plants in southern locations that include Avellino, Pomigliano near Naples
and Cassino, Fiat next year will be producing more from its industries in
the south than the north.
This is an historic change, but for the moment it is a one-off phenomenon in
Italian manufacturing. Other big groups such as Olivetti have operations in
the south but it is much less important in the overall scheme of production.
It also has to be said that a leading player such as Fiat has infinitely
more muscle in dealing both with the government, local administrations and
the complex inter-play of political forces that are an essential component
in managing investment in the south.
To these local phenomena should be added the existence of organised crime.
Fiat is considered a big enough organisation to stand up to the creeping
tentacles of the Naples Camora. However, it was significant that Melfi
happens to have been regarded as a 'clean' area. In areas of Calabria, the
hold of the local mafia over contractors and labour is a big disincentive.
Overall, wage differentials with the north, except in construction, are only
marginal. One recent academic study showed industrial wages in the south
were 11 per cent lower. In contrast, productivity levels are on occasions 25
per cent lower. Small employers maintain that deals can be struck and the
unions, where represented, are less rigid. However, for the labour element
to be a factor in attracting investment, the unions will have to be more
flexible on national minimums, as well as work practices and hiring and
firing.
From the fifties onwards, the main investments have been state-directed and
mostly by state-controlled companies. By law, state companies in the IRI
group or companies such as ENI are obliged to direct 60 per cent of their
investment in the Mezzogiorno - including Sardinia and Sicily. In practice
the percentage peaked at about 50 per cent in the seventies and now it is
down to about 30 per cent.
The aim was laudable - to ensure that southern living standards were raised
to the level of those in the north. And through massive transfers this has
been largely achieved. However, the enormous sums of public money pumped
into the south, equivalent annually to 0.7 per cent of GDP, have not
achieved the stated aim of providing a self-sustaining industrial and
service base. And the weight of manufacturing has not changed. Over the past
40 years it has remained below 15 per cent in the overall composition of
output.
The main explanation for this is the way state industrial initiatives have
been directed towards big capital-intense investments: the so-called
'cathedrals in the desert,' Thus the south has had more than its share of
steel plants and petrochemical complexes. But these have been built without
reference to the needs or potential of the local economy.
For example, the main industries relying on the products produced by
Sicilian petrochemical complexes are in northern Italy.
Since the steel complex project was stalled at Goia Tauro in the late 1970s,
successive governments have agonised as they were lobbied by local political
potentates over what to do with the huge and idle infrastructure already
built. Finally, last month, it was agreed to go ahead with a project to
build a multi-fuel power station. But Goia Tauro power will be carried, at
cost, to the north. There is no industry to benefit near the site.
Furthermore, with rare exceptions such as Fiat, a process of
de-industrialisation is under way in the south. The steel industry, located
at Naples and Taranto, is in the process of being rationalised and
production cut because of over-capacity in the EC.
ENI, the owner of a series of large petrochemical complexes in the south, is
having to restructure. Although decisions on closures, notably those plants
producing fertilisers, have been postponed constantly, the day of reckoning
is close.
Elsewhere the picture is of job losses and threats to plants - especially in
the Naples area. Alenia, the state-controlled aerospace group, has cut back
its operations at Naples.
The Ciampi government is still formulating its policies. They are likely to
focus on efforts to 're-industrialise' those areas where mature industries
are in decline; encourage more professional training; and persuade the
unions to drop their rigid labour practices.
There is also likely to be greater emphasis on problem areas, instead of
lumping the entire Mezzogiorno into one hopeless basket.
Only if these policies are pursued vigorously, and accompanied by increased
police success against the local mafias, will fresh industrial investment
take root.
Otherwise, Italy runs the serious risk of seeing the industrial divide grow,
and the north distance itself from the south.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Survey of Italian Industry and Technology (1): Exports are
ray of hope in bleak year - The effects of recession are likely to be felt
well into 1995 in Italy. There is, however, one exceptionally bright spot.
Export orders for Italian goods have surged, riding on the back of a
devalued lira and well-contained wage costs

<TEXT>
INDUSTRY has suffered most from the current recession in Italy and 1994
promises to be another bleak year.
The balance sheets of flagship private sector groups such as Fiat are
heavily in the red and even the myriad small and medium-sized companies have
been squeezed.
The Turin-based automotive group has been obliged to carry out a huge
recapitalisation and form a core of friendly shareholders to remain a player
in the cut-throat competition of the international car business.
Olivetti, the computers and office equipment group, is struggling to recoup
its elan amid losses. And of the large companies, only Pirelli has begun to
turn round after returning to its core business of tyres and cables.
Life has been even harder among the state industrial groups as major surgery
gets under way to close uneconomic plant, offset heavy financial charges and
prune excess labour against a background of ambitious, but as yet
unfulfilled, privatisation plans.
Emblematic is the fate of Ilva, the state steel group. Itself the product of
three changes of identity since the seventies, it is now due to be split
into two and lose a quarter of its workforce to adapt to European
overcapacity.
Everywhere the three-year-old decline in production and the formal onset of
recession in mid-1992 has left a trail of jobless. The trades unions
estimate that almost 250,000 jobs have been lost in industry this year. This
rhythm of redundancies shows no sign of slowing. As a result, unemployment,
and the destabilising effects of labour unrest, have moved to the top of the
Ciampi government's agenda.
There is, however, one exceptionally bright spot. Export orders for Italian
goods have surged, riding on the back of a devalued lira and well-contained
wage costs. In the first half of 1993, exports were up 20 per cent in value.
The increase was particularly impressive outside the EC, rising 30 per cent
against the same period in 1992.
The export performance has provided a vital supply of oxygen to most
industries this year when domestic demand has dropped more sharply than at
any time since the first oil shock of the seventies. Overall demand could
fall as much 3 per cent this year.
However, economists at Confindustria, the industrialists' confederation, are
convinced the basis is being laid for an export-led recovery next year. They
point out that inflation continues to come down - last month it was running
at an annualised 4 per cent - and should be well below projections of 3.5
per cent for 1994.
In these circumstances, if the fall in domestic demand stabilises and the
export trend continues, the economy will return to growth of around 1.5 per
cent in 1994. This year, growth is expected to be negative: minus 0.3 per
cent.
Nevertheless, the effects of recession are likely to be felt well into 1995
even if a recovery begins in the first half of 1994. The domestic climate
remains one of relatively high interest rates and austerity as the
government tackles public spending.
The 1994 budget, now before parliament, proposes to reduce the heavy fiscal
pressure by 1 percentage point but offers few corporate tax concessions. If
anything, loopholes are being closed on devices used as tax breaks.
Public spending cuts, to reduce the budget deficit to 8.7 per cent of gross
domestic product (GDP), will be felt by those parts of industry that have
traditionally fed off public works contracts. The corruption scandals have
already led to temporary freezes on numerous contracts, notably for roads
and municipal projects. However, the budget squeeze and the effect of the
corruption scandals can be mitigated by better administration of the funds
available.
Infrastructure contracts in particular have been hugely inflated to
accommodate illicit pay-offs. As a result, Italy faces the challenges of
closer European integration with roads, railways, ports and airports below
the standards of its main partners. The government is anxious to make an
early start on the L36,000bn (Pounds 14.9bn) plan to introduce a high-speed
train network, beginning either with a Rome-Naples connection or the
Turin-Milan-Venice link.
Industrialists are the first to recognise that public works projects are but
a palliative. Their two main demands are an end to the rigidities in the
labour market and a further fall in interest rates. In July, Confindustria,
the unions and the government signed an historic tripartite agreement which
abolished the long-standing principle of indexed wages and established that
future pay increases be linked to productivity.
The union sacrificed wages to protect jobs on the understanding that their
two partners would make a determined effort to boost spending on research
and development (R&amp;D), high technology sectors and job training. The
industrialists for their part viewed the agreement as a first step towards a
more flexible labour market. They want temporary job contracts, easier
hire-and-fire regulations, special wages for trainees and an end to the
national minimum wage.
Mr Antonio Maccanico, deputy prime minister and the Ciampi government's
chief trouble shooter, believes common ground can be found. Temporary
employment is likely to be introduced, disguised under the name of
'solidarity contracts', and another cosmetic formula will probably be found
to disguise the growing practical difference between wages in the north and
south of the country.
The second leg to the industrialists' demand - lowering interest rates to
the European norm - will not be easy because of the behaviour of the banks.
Italian banks retain spreads of up to 5 per cent. These high margins are
needed to offset heavy bad loan provisions that have accumulated in the past
two years and worse could be in the pipeline. The collapse of the
Ferruzzi-Montedison group, Italy's second-largest private concern, with
outstanding debts of L31,000bn, has underlined the risks.
Meanwhile, bank operating costs are high due to inefficiencies and
overstaffing. Thus at the very moment when Italian industry most needs
interest rates to drop by at least another three percentage points, the
banks cannot easily oblige. A proper alignment of interest rates is unlikely
to occur until the financial system is modernised through much talked-of
privatisation. The state still controls two thirds of the banking and
financial system.
If the industrialists' complaints are justified, they too can be taken to
task on a number of fronts. Investment remains too rooted in Italy; more
investment should follow export success on the ground. Too little attention
continues to be devoted to developing international alliances and too often
attempts at such alliances have been mishandled. As a result, Italy
possesses the smallest number of multinational companies among its main
trading partners. Another aspect of this 'provincialism' is the continued
family control of so many businesses. Although such control provides the
great advantage of flexibility, it also inhibits financial transparency and
limits the introduction of modern management techniques.
The state-controlled industrial groups also suffer from lack of
transparency, but in their case it is combined with overly rigid management
structures. Happily, Prof Romano Prodi at IRI, the state holding company,
and Mr Franco Bernabe, at ENI, the state oil concern, have begun to apply a
fresh broom. The drying-up of state hand-outs and the need to privatise has
left little alternative.
The Ciampi government has promised to speed up privatisation. But the
complexities of large-scale sell-offs in industry and banking will
inevitably spread the divestiture over at least the next three years.
A hint of the problems ahead has been provided by the saga of Efim, the
state industrial holding placed in liquidation in July 1992 with debts of
L18,000bn. Winding up Efim has been marked by changes of policy and a poor
understanding of the sensitivities of the international financial community
 -while only one large company, SIV, the glassmaker, has been sold off.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Government Bonds: Ecu bonds benefit most as European sector
rallies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

EUROPEAN bonds rallied after Germany's constitutional court gave its broad
approval to the Maastricht treaty for European monetary union.
Prices were also lifted by hopes for further European rate cuts after the
Bundesbank switched to variable-rate repos for today's allocation, following
two months of fixed-rate repos. The move was seen as paving the way for
lower short-term rates in coming weeks.
Ecu bonds were the main beneficiaries of the German ruling and the Ecu bond
contract on Matif jumped 0.80 point to 118.94.
The market had moved to a very defensive pricing in recent months amid
uncertainty over the treaty's ratification, but the ruling removed the last
great unknown, allowing Ecu bonds to become more fairly valued, said Mr Bob
Tyley, head of bond analysis at Paribas Capital Markets.
'Ecu bonds are now very attractive, and I expect investors to come into the
market who were sidelined since the ratification problems began,' he said.
Mr Tyley expects the 10-year Ecu yield spread over bunds to shrink to about
40 basis points before year-end, from 56 basis points now.
Elsewhere, the Bank of England announced the auction of Ecu500m of
three-year Treasury notes, which will be fungible with Ecu1.5bn of notes
sold earlier this year.
GERMAN bonds, which had attracted safe-haven buying in the run-up to the
court ruling, dipped slightly on the announcement but recovered later, aided
by the US Treasury rally and technical futures trading. The December bund
future hit a new high at 100.07 and closed at 100.02. up 0.22 point from
Monday.
The government issued DM3bn of 6 per cent bunds at 100.90, which met with
solid demand, mainly from domestic investors. Another DM3bn-DM4bn is
expected to be sold at today's auction.
Bunds were lifted by hopes that the minimum rate on 14-day repos may ease at
today's Bundesbank repo. Money market dealers forecast a minimum rate of
6.68 per cent, with a liquidity add of some DM10bn seen.
UK gilts rose along with the other markets, but traders reported little cash
activity. 'The market's on tenterhooks about (today's) RPI numbers,' said a
gilts trader.
FRENCH bonds rose in line with other markets, but gains were capped by
technical resistance at 123.18 on the December notional bond future. The
short end of the market firmed on hopes that the German repo rate might ease
today, causing the 3-month December Pibor future to rise 0.16 point to
93.44. Italian bonds posted strong gains, with the BTP future rising 0.81
point to 117.95 and expected to test 118.00 today.
THE JGB futures contract hit a six-year high and closed at 113.70, up 0.29
from Friday. Prices were fuelled by Friday's US Treasuries rally and solid
cash buying, a trader said.
AFTER early gains on follow-through buying of bonds from last Friday,
longer-dated US Treasury prices fell back to opening levels yesterday in the
wake of higher gold and commodities prices.
By late afternoon, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/32 at 104
19/32 , yielding 5.915 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was down  1/32 at 100 1/8 , to yield 3.791 per cent.
After taking Monday off for the Columbus Day holiday, the bond market
resumed the rally it had started last Friday following the release of a
September employment report which traders and investors judged to be bullish
for longer-dated Treasury securities.
Although buying was sporadic, it was enough to lift 30-year prices, and send
the yield on the benchmark issue below 5.9 per cent for the first time since
the Treasury began issuing long bonds on a regular basis in 1977. Prices,
however, could not hold on to their early gains as dwindling volume and a
brief surge in gold and other commodity prices took the shine off the
market's morning glow.

FT  13 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: Osaka to launch contract
based on Nikkei 300 index
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FUTURES and options contract based on the new Nikkei 300 share index is to
be launched in January by the Osaka Securities Exchange, Japan's main
futures market.
The new index is likely to be less volatile than the existing Nikkei 225
index. It is capitalisation weighted, whereas the Nikkei 225 is a
price-weighted average.
The aim is for Nikkei 300 contracts to eventually replace those on the
Nikkei 225.
The move by the OSE should help defuse the debate over futures trading in
Japan. The financial authorities have long blamed OSE futures and options
trading, based on a volatile index, for the weakness of Japanese share
prices.
Although the OSE will not immediately abolish Nikkei 225 contracts, the aim
is for the new contracts to take over as the most widely traded index
futures in Japan. The bulk of stock futures trading is on the OSE, although
its index is based on Tokyo cash prices. Over the past two years, TSE
officials have introduced restrictions to curb speculative trading on the
futures and options markets.
The restrictions have led to a shift in trading from the OSE to the
Singapore International Monetary Exchange, which also lists Nikkei 225
futures. Futures trading volume in Osaka has almost halved since last year.
The ministry of finance and the Tokyo stock market authorities agreed in
December that a capitalisation weighted average was needed as a benchmark
for the futures market, rather than an average which gives a price weighting
to all shares irrespective of differences in capitalisation.
Nihon Keizai Shimbum, the business newspaper that produces the index,
insists that the Nikkei 300 is an additional index, and wants the Nikkei 225
to remain as a benchmark for the Tokyo stock market.
Traders pointed out yesterday that it was too early to say whether the new
index would replace the Nikkei 225 as a new benchmark. However, Tokyo
traders have begun shifting positions from the Nikkei 225 to the Nikkei 300,
selling Nikkei 225 component stocks not included in the Nikkei 300.
Japanese traders are now focusing on the reaction at Simex, where volume
could suffer if Japanese stock futures trading shifts from the Nikkei 225 to
Nikkei 300.

FT  13 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: Commerzbank to issue
certificates of deposit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COMMERZBANK, one of Germany's largest banks, is expanding its range of
fundraising instruments with its first issue of certificates of deposit
(CDs).
These short-term instruments are an extremely popular source of fundraising
for banks in the UK and the US, but rare in Germany. Only a handful of
German credit institutions has issued CDs since they were made legal by the
Bundesbank in 1986.
Commerzbank said yesterday that the minimum investment will be DM5m, and the
yield will be above that of comp-arable German government securities.
Available immediately, they will have a maturity of at least 30 days.
Commerzbank said that the secondary market for the paper would be highly
liquid.
The chief source of short-term finance for German banks is money left on
deposit by corporate and private customers at rates which tend to be more
favourable to the banks than in other countries.
The issue is part of a slow trend towards 'securitisation' in German
financial markets, the most obvious sign of which is the development of the
commercial paper market.

FT  13 OCT 93 / International Bonds: Market expects EC's Ecu1bn Eurobond
launch today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community is expected to launch its widely-expected Ecu1bn
offering of seven-year Eurobonds today. The issue is seen as an attempt by
the EC to attract institutional investors back to the Ecu bond market.
Several borrowers, ranging from the Council of Europe to Sweden, injected
just over Ecu1bn of liquidity into the Ecu bond market last month but these
issues were mainly targeted at retail investors.
The EC's decision to award the mandate jointly to four banks - BNP, CSFB,
Dresdner and Goldman Sachs - reflects the importance which the EC has
attached to the issue, as well as its desire to achieve the widest
distribution.
The bonds are expected to be priced to yield 10-12 basis points below the
yield on the French government's 9 1/2 per cent Ecu-denominated OAT due
April 2000.
Yesterday, the international bond market was dominated by two large 10-year
offerings from Belgium and Depfa, Germany's largest mortgage bank. Both
issues had been well flagged and were sold out by the end of the day.
Belgium's issue, which raised Dollars 500m, was seen to be sensibly priced
at a spread of 32 basis points over the yield on the 5 3/4 per cent US
Treasury due 2003 in view of recent worries about the country's budget
deficit and its increasing external borrowings. As a result the spread
remained virtually unchanged once the bonds were freed to trade.
Lead manager Merrill Lynch said that there was surprisingly strong demand
for the bonds from east Asia, where about one-third of the issue was placed.
Interest from the UK was also good but demand from Germany was below
expectations.
Depfa achieved a surprisingly low spread of 25 basis points over UK
government bonds for its first Eurosterling issue which raised Pounds 500m.
The spread tightened to 22 1/2 basis points soon after the bonds were freed
to trade.
Syndicate managers said Depfa had done well on pricing, given that it did
not have a rating and that it was still relatively unknown outside Germany.
However, some felt that the spread left little room for further narrowing in
the secondary market.
Joint lead manager UBS said that the issue was targeted at investors who
were buying Depfa paper for the first time, in accordance with the issuer's
aim to broaden its funding base. The issue was also seen as a platform for
any future sterling borrowings by Depfa.
Mr Frank Ruhland, Depfa's treasurer, said the issue reflected the bank's
need to diversify its funding away from the domestic market now that it was
increasing its lending business abroad.
The proceeds of the issue will be used to fund the bank's growing commercial
property mortgage business in the UK. Depfa has also expanded its public
sector financing activities outside Germany over the past 18 months and has
lent to sovereign borrowers and agencies in Denmark, Belgium, Ireland and
Spain.
Depfa has raised DM26bn of its 1993 funding programme of close to DM30bn but
only around DM4bn has been raised internationally. Mr Ruhland expects a
higher proportion of Depfa's funding to be sourced outside Germany in
future.

FT  13 OCT 93 / International Company News: Saudi banks report sharp rise in
profits over nine-month term

<TEXT>
THREE of Saudi Arabia's 11 joint-venture banks have reported sharply
increased profits for the nine months to September 30 compared with the same
period in 1992.
Saudi British Bank, 40 per cent owned by British Bank of the Middle East,
part of London-based HSBC Holdings, reported nine-month net profits
exceeding the full-year profits of any previous year - SR298.8m (Dollars
79.7m), an increase of 50.2 per cent from the SR198.9m in the same period of
1992.
Total assets, at SR21,954m, have increased some 30 per cent in the past two
years.
Saudi French Bank, 31 per cent owned by Paris-based Banque Indosuez, saw net
profits rise 60 per cent to SR269.3m from SR168.3m.
Net profits at Arab National Bank, 40 per cent owned by Amman's Arab Bank,
increased nearly 30 per cent to SR368.9m, compared with SR287.7m in the same
nine-month period last year.
Mr Andrew Dixon, managing director of Saudi British Bank, said that sales in
the kingdom's private sector were 'buoyant'.
'There is an increasing drive from the non-oil private sector into industry.
Import substitution is a reality, and the economy is probably growing at an
annual rate of between 4 per cent and 5 per cent,' Mr Dixon said.
However, while private sector non-oil contribution to gross domestic product
was growing, the economy as a whole was very much 'oil-driven', so much
depended on the future trend of oil prices, he said.
Mr Dixon added: 'I feel reasonably comfortable that we should be able to
maintain our present performance in the last quarter of this year, though
for next year no one can be sure because of changing interest rate scenarios
overseas which are moving from one type of market to another.'
His comments underline the fact that a large proportion of banks' earnings
are coming from net interest income, gains on bond portfolios, and higher
fee earnings.

The car will be built in an Dollars 800m expansion to Toyota's factory at
Georgetown, Kentucky, which is one of the most efficient car plants in the

THE US television home shopping industry got a boost yesterday when two
separate cable television groups announced ventures involving CUC
International, which provides offers home shopping to some 30m Americans via
the telephone and computer.
Viacom, the cable company bidding for Paramount Communications, said it
would be testing a home shopping service, in conjunction with CUC and
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, in the Castro Valley, California, where
Viacom and AT&amp;T are due to launch a full-scale test of interactive
television services next year.
Time Warner, the second largest US cable operator, said it had agreed with
CUC to create an interactive home shopping service in Orlando, Florida,
where Time Warner is establishing its first commercial
interactive-television service, the Full Service Network.
Viacom, whose bid for Paramount is competing against a higher but hostile
offer from QVC - one of the largest television home shopping networks - said
the Castro Valley test would give customers the same broad range of products
and services CUC currently offered to members through telephones and
computers.
Time Warner said its service would offer merchandise from CUC's database of
250,000 brand-named products and would allow customers to view and purchase
items on demand. CUC would use its existing systems to process orders.
In another home shopping move, Time Warner announced last month that it and
Spiegel, a leading specialty fashion retailer and catalogue company, were
joining forces to create two new cable channels, focused mainly on women.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Paper, the US forest products group, yesterday posted
third-quarter net income of Dollars 48m, or 39 cents a share, including
charges of Dollars 28m, or 23 cents, reflecting a higher federal income tax
rate. Sales slid to Dollars 3.4bn from Dollars 3.5bn.
Stripping out the tax adjustment, net income was Dollars 76m, or 62 cents,
in the quarter. In the same period of 1992, International Paper earned
Dollars 98m, or 81 cents.
Mr John Georges, chairman and chief executive, said that depressed pricing
levels for paper and packaging products in the US and abroad had dampened
the cyclical rebound that the company had been expecting.
Earnings before interest and taxes fell 6.5 per cent from the previous year
reflecting higher interest costs in 1993.
For the first nine months, International Paper had net earnings of Dollars
189m, or Dollars 1.53 per share, on sales of Dollars 10.3bn against income
of Dollars 282m, or Dollars 2.17 on sales of Dollars 10.2bn last year. The
1992 figures include charges of 41 cents a share for accounting changes.

<TEXT>
GUINNESS Peat Group, the UK-based investment vehicle for Sir Ron Brierley
which is now listed in Australia, yesterday launched an ADollars 18m
(USDollars 12m) bid for a Queensland-based beer company, Power Brewing -
saying that its ultimate plan was to wind up the company.
Under the offer terms, GPG proposes to pay 44 cents a share for half of each
investor's shareholding in Power. GPG has been building a stake in Power,
which is currently 8.3 per cent. Full acceptance of the offer would take
GPG's interest to 52 per cent.
If it wins control, GPG plans to negotiate the end of a joint venture
between Power and Carlton and United Breweries, and then liquidate Power or
'otherwise return funds to shareholders'.
Sir Ron claimed yesterday that the business was 'essentially uneconomic',
and that the offer would give shareholders an immediate premium for part of
their holdings, and then participation in 'an orderly phasing out of
unprofitable trading operations'.
Power Brewing urged shareholders not to sell until the company had
considered the offer further, and described the bid price as 'seriously
inadequate'.
Power's shares closed up 3 cents at 45 cents.

FT  13 OCT 93 / International Company News: Honda and Isuzu to extend
agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONDA and Isuzu are to extend their product-sharing relationship, further
highlighting the pressure on Japanese carmakers to curb development costs.
Honda will supply Isuzu with a version of its popular Accord to be sold
under the Isuzu badge in Japan, and with its Domani model for sale in
Thailand.
Isuzu will supply Honda with its Big Horn recreational vehicle, which Honda
will sell under its own marque.
The exchange extends an agreement reached earlier this year. Under that
agreement Honda already provides Isuzu with its Domani, which Isuzu sells in
Japan, while Isuzu will provide Honda with two types of recreational
vehicle, the Rodeo and Mu, for sale in the US and Japan respectively.
The arrangement will help the companies to utilise their capacity better
during one of the worst recessions the Japanese car industry has faced, as
well as extend their product ranges.
The market for recreational vehicles has been growing strongly in Japan, but
Honda has been left behind because of a lack of models.
Isuzu, meanwhile, has pulled out of passenger car production and relies on
products supplied by other manufacturers to complement its range.
The decision by Honda and Isuzu to rely on other carmakers to provide them
with models reflects the dilemma faced by the Japanese car industry.
While carmakers need to supply their dealers with a wide range of products,
overcapacity in the market and the urgent need to cut costs has limited
their ability to develop a full range of models, not all of which would sell
in high volumes.
Although Honda and Isuzu will be competing with each other in the Japanese
market for sales of the cars they are to supply each other, such competition
was not a significant concern since the two companies' dealers have very
different customer bases, Honda said.
The two companies are exploring the possibility of further product
exchanges. Any further extension depends on 'whether Isuzu has anything more
to offer', Honda added.

<TEXT>
NISSAN, Japan's second-largest car manufacturer, yesterday warned it would
probably suffer an operating loss in the fiscal year to March 1994 - its
second in a row - unless the yen declined in value against the US dollar.
Mr Yoshifumi Tsuji, Nissan's president, warned that the exchange rate of
Y106 to the dollar was much higher than that on which the company had based
its profit forecast. If it remained at this level, the company would not be
able to break even this year, as it had expected.
Nissan based its earlier profits forecast on an exchange rate of Y110 to the
dollar in the first half and Y115 in the second half. The yen has been
fluctuating recently at around Y106.
Mr Tsuji also said that Nissan was forecasting lower unit sales at between
1.17m and 1.18m units this year, down from the 1.2m units it had expected
earlier in the year.
To deal with the difficult market, the company is considering bringing
forward plans to reduce its workforce by 5,000 by the end of 1996. It might
also reduce its winter bonus, although Nissan has yet to consult its labour
union, the company said.
In the year to March 1993, Nissan reported its first net loss of Y15.1bn
(Dollars 14m) compared with a net profit of Y54.2bn in the previous year.
Pre-tax losses came to Y26.3bn compared with a profit of Y87.8bn and the
company was forced to halve its dividend.
Nissan had been looking to break even this year at the pre-tax level,
although it is forecasting a loss of Y40bn in the first half, which the
company hoped would be offset by profits in the second half.
However, domestic demand has remained depressed. Toyota, the largest car
manufacturer in Japan, was recently forced to reduce its unit sales forecast
for the second time this year.
Nevertheless, Mr Tsuji was still optimistic about second-half sales, and the
company is planning to launch new models.

UNILEVER, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products company, has agreed to
buy a margarine brand from Ajinomoto, a leading Japanese food manufacturer,
for an undisclosed price.
The acquisition will lift Nippon Lever, Unilever's Japanese unit, to Japan's
second largest margarine producer, with 25 per cent of the market. The move
comes at a time when Japanese food companies are restructuring their
operations by cutting down on products and reducing inventories.
Ajinomoto, which is also trying to slim its business by cutting unprofitable
operations, will leave the margarine market altogether with the sale of its
Marina brand.
The company entered the market 23 years ago.

<TEXT>
TWO leading Japanese retailers unveiled depressed interim figures yesterday,
displaying evidence of the problems facing the industry as consumer
confidence plunges following prolonged economic slump.
Nagasakiya, a large supermarket chain, posted an unconsolidated pre-tax loss
of Y1.7bn (Dollars 16m) for the first six months to August, compared with a
loss of Y1.2bn a year earlier. The company was hit by the unusually long
rainy season and cool summer.
Sales for the March-August period fell 5 per cent to Y197bn, while after-tax
losses totalled Y1.4bn against a profit of Y552m the previous year.
The company, which paid an annual dividend of Y7.5 per share, will be forced
to forego dividend payments for the current business year to February.
Annual pre-tax losses are expected to widen to Y2.9bn from the previous
year's Y539m, on a 3.5 per cent fall in sales to Y400bn.
Takashimaya, an upmarket department store, suffered an 89 per cent plunge in
pre-tax profit for the the first six months to August to Y380m, on a 9.5 per
cent fall in sales to Y3.5bn.
A fall in sales of mainstay items including clothing was caused by slack
demand. However, after-tax profits surged 81.8 per cent due to revenue from
land sales in Tokyo.
For the year to February, the company expects pre-tax profits to fall 39.1
per cent to Y3bn on a 7 per cent fall in sales to Y730bn. Takashimaya plans
to trim capital investment costs by 30 per cent as part of cost- cutting
efforts.

forecast

<TEXT>
MOTOROLA, the US semiconductor manufacturer, reported earnings sharply above
forecast, AP-DJ reports.
Third-quarter earnings jumped to Dollars 254m, or 92 cents a share from
Dollars 127m, or 47 cents, a year earlier. Analysts had expected between 67
cents and 83 cents a share.
Sales in the quarter totalled Dollars 4.48bn against Dollars 3.48bn in the
same period last year.
Nine-month earnings amounted to Dollars 682m, or Dollars 2.50, up from
Dollars 272m, or Dollars 1.02, a year earlier. Sales for the nine months
totalled Dollars 11.97bn, against Dollars 9.59bn.
Nine-months earnings per share fully diluted were Dollars 2.40, against
Dollars 1.01. Last year's figures include a loss of Dollars 123m from the
cumulative effect of adopting a new accounting standard.
Motorola said its third-quarter net margin on sales was 5.7 per cent,
against 3.7 per cent a year earlier, while in the first nine months net
margin on sales was 5.7 per cent, up from 4.1 per cent a year earlier.
Mr Gary Tooker, president and chief operating officer, said sales in the
semiconductor products segment rose 31 per cent for the quarter, to Dollars
1.51bn. Orders rose 25 per cent and segment profits increased.
In the general systems sector, sales rose 43 per cent to Dollars 1.35bn,
while orders advanced 58 per cent. Segment profits also increased, Motorola
said.
The company did not provide any forecast, beyond saying that third-quarter
and nine-months results were not necessarily indicative of those for the
full year.

Salem, which makes sportswear licensed by the four big US professional

Fruit of the Loom believes the price it paid for the company will be
justified by the opportunity to expand its range of sports and children's

FT  13 OCT 93 / International Company News: US brokers post strong advances

SHARES in US securities brokerages rose sharply yesterday after three big
Wall Street firms reported strong quarterly earnings.
The results were better than analysts and investors expected and confirmed
that low domestic interest rates, heavy investor interest in stock and bond
markets and buoyant corporate demand for underwriting services are
continuing to fuel Wall Street's profits boom.
Merrill Lynch, the industry leader, led the way with record third-quarter
net income of Dollars 360m, up 57 per cent from a year ago, on record net
revenues of Dollars 2.64bn.
Investment banking put in the strongest performance, with revenues rising 24
per cent to Dollars 452m as the firm cemented its position as the world's
biggest underwriter of debt and equities.
So far this year, Merrill has helped its clients raise Dollars 155bn in
financings on US and overseas securities markets.
Revenues from principal transactions rose 20 per cent to Dollars 733m, due
to big profits from trading derivatives, equities and money market
instruments.
Commission revenues climbed 23 per cent to Dollars 690m, while asset
management and custodial fees rose 18 per cent to Dollars 250m. Non-interest
expenses rose in line with business activity, increasing by 13 per cent to
Dollars 2bn.
As expected, Merrill announced a two-for-one stock split aimed at making its
shares, which rose above Dollars 100 for the first time yesterday, more
attractive to a wider group of investors. By the close Merrill's shares were
up Dollars 2 7/8 at Dollars 101 5/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.
The factors which spurred Merrill's earnings also played a part in the
healthy profit gains recorded at PaineWebber and Bear Stearns.
PaineWebber reported a 14 per cent increase in third-quarter net income to
Dollars 59.1m, earned on revenues of Dollars 736.8m, up from Dollars 625.8m
a year earlier.
Revenues from commissions, principal transactions and asset management were
all higher.
The one disappointment was investment banking, where revenues remained
strong at Dollars 100.8m but still came in 5 per cent lower than a year ago.
The firm's non-interest expenses increased 17.5 per cent to Dollars 637.4m.
PaineWebber's shares rose Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 34 3/8 on the NYSE.
Bear Stearns recorded the biggest increase in earnings of the three, with
net income jumping 66 per cent to Dollars 104.3m in the company's fiscal
first quarter.
Commissions and principal transactions revenues were both strong, but the
investment banking business sparkled, with revenues rising 91 per cent to
Dollars 119.2m.
On the NYSE, Bear Stearns shares were up Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 24 3/4 at
the close.
Discount brokerage Charles Schwab, which two weeks ago said it would post a
big increase in third-quarter earnings, announced profits for the period of
Dollars 22.2m, up from Dollars 7.8m a year earlier. The results were better
than expected and Schwab's shares rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 37 3/8 on
the New York Stock Exchange.

FT  13 OCT 93 / International Company News: Poor prices hit Alcan Aluminium
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POOR ingot and fabricated product prices, worsened by the European and
Japanese recessions, outweighed Alcan Aluminium's cost-cutting efforts in
the third quarter.
The company reported a loss of USDollars 13m, or 8 cents a share, against a
loss of Dollars 12m, or 7 cents, a year earlier, on revenues of Dollars
1.82bn, against Dollars 1.97bn.
For the first nine months, Alcan's loss was Dollars 68m, or 37 cents a
share, against Dollars 56m, or 31 cents, on revenues of Dollars 5.45bn,
against Dollars 5.8bn.
LME spot prices for ingot have languished below the equivalent of 50 cents a
pound for many weeks, partly because of reports of increasing exports by
smelters in the former Soviet Union.
Alcan's ingot shipments in the third quarter were 225,000 tonnes against
213,000 tonnes a year earlier, and of fabricated products 393,000 tonnes
against 349,000 tonnes. The trend was similar in the nine months, although
average price realisations were lower.
The company did not make any forecast for the final quarter but said no
early upturn in prices was expected.

FT  13 OCT 93 / International Company News: Westinghouse earnings down by
29% to Dollars 65m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WESTINGHOUSE, the diversified US group which has been struggling to recover
from heavy losses by its financial services division, yesterday said that
poor performances by its core businesses had contributed to a 29 per cent
decline in third-quarter earnings.
The company, which has interests ranging from nuclear power to radio
stations, said net income from continuing operations was Dollars 65m, or 15
cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 2.06bn. In the corresponding period of
1992, net income was Dollars 91m, or 22 cents, on turnover of Dollars
2.27bn.
'Obviously the third quarter's financial results are disappointing,' said Mr
Michael Jordan, who was named chairman and chief executive in July.
His appointment followed the departure of Mr Paul Lego, who had faced
pressure from institutional shareholders to stem losses from the group's
property market activities.
Earnings for the nine months to end-September - down 25 per cent from a year
earlier - showed a similar rate of decline as the quarterly results.
Net income from continuing operations was Dollars 208m, or 48 cents a share,
on revenues of Dollars 6.23bn. This compares with net income of Dollars
278m, or 77 cents, in the same period of 1992, on revenues of Dollars
6.67bn.
In the latest quarter, the performances of environmental services and
electronic systems were particularly weak, with revenues 'down
substantially' for both divisions. Westinghouse does not provide specific
figures for its segments.
The company said the environmental arm had suffered because of sagging
demand for its hazardous waste clean-up and incineration services. Sluggish
trading conditions in Europe had been a contributing factor, it added.
Westinghouse attributed the decline at its important electronic systems
division to reduced spending by the US defence department.
The company recently converted some of its military hardware for use in law
enforcement and home security, but it is uncertain whether the extended
product range will prove a success.
Westinghouse's broadcasting operation was another lacklustre area. The
company blamed a downturn in operating profit at the division on a weak
performance in the west coast television market.
The power systems segment, meanwhile, showed a sharp decline in operating
profit because of reduced shipments and other factors.
In September, Westinghouse warned investors that it expected a 50 per cent
drop in net income in the third quarter.
With the results not quite as dire as had been forecast, Wall Street reacted
calmly to yesterday's announcement. GE shares closed Dollars 1/8 lower at
Dollars 13 3/8.

FT  13 OCT 93 / International Company News: Fannie Mae achieves 23rd record
quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FEDERAL National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) reported record
third-quarter profits of Dollars 477.2m yesterday, up from Dollars 412.9m in
the same period a year ago.
It was the 23rd consecutive quarter of record profits for the company, which
is the largest mortgage provider in the US.
The strong earnings were achieved in spite of Dollars 50.6m in after-tax
losses incurred due to the call of debt at a premium and the repurchase of
high-coupon debt.
The record third quarter took Fannie Mae's nine-month earnings to Dollars
1.38bn, well ahead of the Dollars 1.19bn recorded over the same period of
1992 and on target to outpace the Dollars 1.62bn earned in all of last year.
Mr James Johnson, chairman and chief executive officer of the company, said
various factors were behind the latest results, including a big rise in
interest income, healthy gains in guaranty fees, and record income from the
sale of Remics (real estate mortgage investment conduits).
Fannie Mae's net interest income rose 5 per cent to Dollars 661.7m,
following a 22 per cent increase in the size of the company's net mortgage
portfolio to Dollars 179bn and a widening in its net interest margin (the
difference between the interest Fannie Mae earns on mortgage loans and the
interest it pays to borrow money) from 133 basis points a year ago to 140
basis points.
As for Fannie Mae's readings on the state of the US housing market, the
company reported that acquisitions of foreclosed single-family properties
rose from 2,790 in the second quarter to 3,206 in the July to September
period.
However, it added that its serious delinquency rate for single-family loans,
a key indicator of credit quality, declined to a 14-year low of 0.56 per
cent.
Fannie Mae's shares were unchanged at Dollars 80 1/8 on the New York Stock
Exchange.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROCTER &amp; Gamble, the US household products and foods group, expects to
report record first-quarter unit volume and earnings, Reuter reports from
Cincinnati.
Mr Edwin Artzt, chairman and chief executive, told the annual meeting that
the company had absorbed less favourable foreign currency exchange rates.
Without these effects, first-quarter earning would be well ahead of the
company's average growth rate in 1992-93.
Even after these effects, which have affected most US companies, the company
would still report a substantial year-on-year profit increase, Mr Artzt
said.
Procter &amp; Gamble's worldwide unit volume growth in the first quarter was 6
per cent, excluding discontinued pulp and orange juice operations.
Mr Artzt cited improved US business as a key to the results. He also said
the company's globalisation strategy was paying off and he expected the
company's international share to reach 60 per cent of world sales by the
year 2000.
He added that there was real momentum in the business, especially in the US,
where shipments were up 6 per cent during the past six months.
In addition, cash flow from operations reached a record Dollars 3.3bn.
During 1992-93, the company's worldwide unit volume grew 4 per cent.
Mr Artzt said he expected the company's stock to appreciate in line with
future earnings growth. The shares closed yesterday at Dollars 50 3/8, up
Dollars 5/8.

GENERAL Electric, the diversified US manufacturing and services group,
yesterday unveiled slightly better-than-expected third-quarter earnings and
predicted record results for the whole of 1993.
Seven of the group's 12 business segments achieved double-digit growth in
operating profits.
Only the aircraft engines business posted lower operating profits in the
quarter.
The company reported net earnings of Dollars 1.21bn, or Dollars 1.41 a
share, compared with Dollars 1.11bn, or Dollars 1.30, in the same period of
last year. Most analysts had expected earnings per share of Dollars 1.40 in
the latest quarter. Revenues advanced by 4 per cent to Dollars 14.86bn from
Dollars 14.27bn.
On Wall Street, shares in GE closed down Dollars 1 at Dollars 95 1/2 .
Last year's earnings included Dollars 114m from GE's aerospace business,
which was transferred to Martin Marietta this year.
Mr Jack Welch, chairman, said earnings from GE's continuing operations
increased 21 per cent from the previous year.
Mr Welch added that the operating margin for the quarter was a record 11.6
per cent, compared with 10.2 per cent a year ago, excluding 1992
restructuring charges.
He said the company strengthened its global presence during the quarter.
The power systems division recorded more than Dollars 800m in international
orders. In Europe, GE's NBC television business acquired a majority stake in
Super Channel.
In Thailand, GE Capital Services, the financial services group, formed a
joint venture to provide consumer and commercial financing.
For the first nine months of 1993, GE reported net earnings of Dollars
3.7bn, or Dollars 4.33 including a first-quarter accounting charge of
Dollars 862m, or Dollars 1.01. A year earlier, it earned Dollars 3.38bn, or
Dollars 3.95. Revenues advanced to Dollars 42.48bn from Dollars 40.87bn.
Mr Welch said: 'The first three quarters of 1993 have once again
demonstrated GE employees' ability to cope with change and win in a
difficult global economy.
'We expect this trend to continue in the fourth quarter and for the year,
more than overcoming the absence of Dollars 345m of aerospace operating net
earnings,' he added.

PEPSICO, the US food and soft drinks group, reported a 9 per cent increase
in third-quarter net income to Dollars 458m.
Strong advances in most parts of the business outweighed a poor performance
from the Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants.
The latest results would have shown a 17 per cent increase in net income to
Dollars 495m, but the figure was affected by changes in the US tax regime.
The effect was to reduce the latest earnings per share figure from 61 cents
to 56 cents, a 6 per cent increase on last year.
The impact of the tax changes on full-year earnings would be to reduce net
income by an estimated Dollars 40m, equivalent to 5 cents a share.
Operating profits rose by 20 per cent to Dollars 886m, with all three
divisions growing by 17 per cent or more. Strongest performer was the
beverages business, which increased operating profits by 22 per cent to
Dollars 355m.
In the US, new products such as Crystal Pepsi helped counter the effects of
a product tampering incident in June, taking domestic beverage profits ahead
by 21 per cent.
International beverage profits rose by 28 per cent, helped by geographical
expansion.
Snack-food operating profits rose by 19 per cent to Dollars 309m with strong
volume growth in the US and internationally.
The restaurant division recorded a 17 per cent profits increase to Dollars
222m in spite of 15 per cent downturn in worldwide profits from Kentucky
Fried Chicken, partly because of the successful launch of the large-size
Bigfoot pizza in the US Pizza Hut chain.

BOMBARDIER, the Canadian transportation group, announced that it is set to
launch the 70-seat turbo-prop de Havilland Dash 8-400 airliner early next
year.
The Dash 8 family will then include 37-, 50- and 70-seat aircraft designed
for short distance service.
The company said that nearly 400 Dash 8 aircraft have been sold to 60
airlines in 22 countries.
The new 400 model will integrate with existing Dash 8 fleets. At 350 knots,
the aircraft will carry 70 passengers 500 nautical miles in 107 minutes.
Maximum range is 1,240 nautical miles.
The first flight is due in July 1996, and Canadian certification in
September 1997, with deliveries starting a month later.
Bombardier is also well advanced with developing a 70-seat version of its
50-passenger Regional Jet, now in service in Europe and North America.
The CRJ-X will have commonality with the smaller RJ and use the same flight
simulators. Range will be up to 1,365 nautical miles.

deal
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN banks owed L6,500bn (Dollars 4.1bn) by the collapsed
Ferruzzi-Montedison empire are refusing to comply with the timetable for
acceptance of a moratorium on interest payments.
Representatives of Italian banks, owed 75 per cent of Ferruzzi-Montedison's
overall debt of L28,000bn, have agreed in principle to accept a freeze on
interest payments due this year as part of a radical restructuring plan of
Italy's second-largest private group.
However, one of the foreign creditors yesterday indicated that it would be
very premature to talk of an agreement.
Representatives of 20 of the most exposed of the 110 foreign banks, which
met on Monday in Milan, split into two groups. The meetings were primarily
intended to explain the restructuring plan for Ferruzzi Finanziaria
(Ferfin), the quoted financial holding, and for Montedison, the industrial
group controlled by Ferfin.
The restructuring plan, drawn up by Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank, and
endorsed last week by the Bank of Italy, aims at selling off non-core
business to reduce debt, consolidation of debt and recapitalisation. It
includes a L800bn fund to cover small creditors needs and dissuade them from
boycotting the plan.
A full meeting of all the foreign banks, originally to be held in Zurich on
Thursday, is expected to be held in Milan. Only then will the restructuring
plan be formally distributed to all the foreign creditors. The document runs
to nearly 600 pages and it is thought they are unlikely to make up their
minds this week.
Representatives of all the Italian banks meanwhile are due to meet today to
give their formal approval to the restructuring plan and the debt
moratorium.
The foreign banks' unwillingness to give a quick endorsement is thought
unlikely to prevent the holding on Thursday of the board meetings of Ferfin
and Montedison to approve their half-yearly results. These were postponed on
September 30 because the administrators were unable to write into the
accounts the beneficial effects of a debt moratorium.
Rejection of the plan risks bankruptcy proceedings for Ferruzzi-Montedison.
The administrators of Ferruzzi-Montedison are arguing that bankruptcy could
lead to greater losses than the L1,500bn cost of a debt moratorium.
The debt freeze will provide breathing space for the operating companies,
controlled by the Ferruzzi family until the collapse in May, to lift
profitability.

<TEXT>
POLAND is to sell one of the country's most modern cement works, in Ozarow,
to a group of domestic investors led by the Polish Development Bank (PBR),
Mr Janusz Lewandowski, the outgoing privatisation minister, said yesterday.
The decision comes in a letter of intent signed yesterday with the
state-owned PBR as well as management and unions at the plant.
It follows the sale in July of stakes in two Polish plants, which account
for a quarter of Poland's cement output, to Cimenteries CBR of Belgium for
DM90.4m (Dollars 56.5m).
CBR has since sold a 43 per cent share of its equity to Heidelberger Zement,
Germany's largest producer of building materials.
The Ozarow plant has a 15 per cent share of the market and expects to report
a 100bn zlotys (Dollars 5m) net profit on sales of 850bn zlotys, which
represents a 30 per cent increase on 1992 sales. It was completed in 1977,
along with Gorazdze, one of the two plants sold to CBR.

fell by 14 per cent to FFr281m (Dollars 50.2m) from FFr327m in the same
period of 1992.
TF1 attributed the decline in interim profits to seasonal factors and
stressed that its first-half performance might not be indicative of the
trend for the full financial year.
The French media has come under strain over the past year as many
advertisers have cut their marketing budgets. The reform of media buying,
implemented by the former socialist government, has also destabilised the
industry.
In spite of these difficulties, TF1, which commands 40.8 per cent of the
French television audience, increased its share of TV advertising to 54.4
per cent.
Advertising revenue rose 7 per cent to FFr3.35bn in the first half of 1993,
from FFr3.13bn in the same period of 1992.
This contributed to a 5.4 per cent increase in consolidated sales to
FFr3.92bn from FFr3.72bn and a 51.1 per cent rise in operating profits to
FFr420m from FFr278m.
However, TF1 did not have the benefit of the FFr125m capital gain made in
the first half of 1992 from a property sale.

FT  13 OCT 93 / International Company News: AlliedSignal in venture with
BASF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIEDSIGNAL, the US high technology group, and BASF's North American arm
have agreed to combine their nylon carpet fibre and textile nylon businesses
into an equally-owned joint venture.
The businesses which will form the venture had combined 1992 sales of
Dollars 1bn. The venture will include fibre manufacturing sites, research
facilities and sales officers.
AlliedSignal, which has enjoyed impressive earnings growth since the arrival
of a new chairman in 1991, said the venture would enhance its earnings and
cash flow.
Mr Frederic Posses, president of AlliedSignal Engineered Materials, said:
'Our customers will benefit from manufacturing efficiencies and other cost
savings.'
BASF, one of Germany's big three chemicals companies, generates Dollars 5bn
of sales in North America through its BASF Corporation subsidiary.
The joint venture would create a more cost-effective producer which would be
large enough to compete in the global man-made fibre market place, the group
said yesterday.
Like other European chemicals companies, BASF is suffering from recession in
European chemicals markets. Its problems have been exacerbated by the
strength of the D-Mark. Group net profits fell by 57 per cent in the first
half of the year to DM199m (Dollars 124m).
The latest move fits with its policy of forging strategic alliances in
fields where it believes that it does not have the critical mass to compete
on its own.
AlliedSignal, based in Morris Township, New Jersey, expects the venture to
be a more cost effective producer of nylon fibre, providing fibre customers
with more choice and better value.
Fibres are part of AlliedSignal's engineered materials operations, the
smallest of the company's three main segments with 1992 sales of Dollars
2.6bn or about 22 per cent of the company's total 1992 sales. The engineered
materials business produces chemicals, catalysts, laminate systems,
performance materials, plastics and amorphous metals.
Mr Howard Rubel, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, said the joint venture 'has
synergies written all over it. This will allow them to rationalise costs and
provide a counter-balance to some of the growing threats in fibres markets'.
AlliedSignal's fibres business is facing growing competition from polyester
and polyolefin fibres which often can be used interchangeably with nylon
fibres.

shareholders

<TEXT>
VOLVO, Sweden's leading manufacturing group, yesterday sought to reassure
its shareholders over the proposed merger of its car and truck operations
with France's Renault, saying the French government intended to privatise
Renault by the end of 1995 at the latest.
At a meeting of a dozen of the company's biggest shareholders in Gothenburg,
Volvo stressed the French commitment to privatise Renault after the merger
is completed.
It said that Volvo's interests would be protected through the 35 per cent
share it will have in the merged group.
Criticism in Sweden, led by Aktiespararna, the Swedish small shareholders'
association which wants the merger deal blocked at a November 9
shareholders' meeting, has focused on fears that Volvo car and truck
manufacturing will in effect be handed over to French state control with no
concrete guarantees over subsequent privatisation.
The company said it had faith in French statements that Renault would almost
certainly be privatised by the end of 1995.
But it acknowledged that after privatisation, it could not increase its
17.85 per cent direct stake in Renault-Volvo Automotive, the operational
company, without permission from the French government under its plans to
hold a 'golden share'.
However, Volvo said that under the merger agreement it could not be
overridden on key issues, such as changes in share capital and mergers,
because these will be handled by the RVC holding company in which Volvo will
have an effective veto.
Volvo's second-largest shareholder after Renault, a state pension fund, said
yesterday that it would back the merger, increasing the odds against
Aktiespararna's attempt to stop the deal.
However, analysts said that shareholders would continue to demand more
detailed information from Volvo, an issue which was not addressed at
yesterday's meeting.
Volvo also announced that its nominees to the six-person RVC board would be
Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo's chairman; Mr Bo Rydin, its vice-chairman and a
respected figure in Swedish industry; and Mr Soren Gyll, Volvo's chief
executive.

profits rise

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COMPAGNIE Generale des Eaux, the French construction and communications
group, yesterday reported net profit for the first half of this year had
risen to FFr1.98bn (Dollars 35m), up 8.7 per cent from FFr1.1bn in the same
period of 1992.
The group said it planned to raise between FFr3bn and FFr4bn through a
rights issue by the end of the year, but gave no further details.
Generale des Eaux controls SFR, the only private cellular telephone operator
in France (in competition with France Telecom). The rapid growth of SFR
investments had created the need for a sharp increase in depreciation
allowances, the group said.
Generale des Eaux was recently given permission by the French government to
test a new small cordless telephone in Paris, as a possible competitor to
the Bi-Bop product launched by France Telecom.
Generale des Eaux said its first-half turnover was little changed, at
FFr70.7bn, from the first half last year. But the static overall figure
masked a 'sharp slowdown' in construction and property, in spite of its
continuing contract to build a new headquarters for Societe Generale, the
bank, at the Defense site in Paris.
This drop was offset by 'satisfactory growth' in its traditional activity of
water distribution and filtering, and an even better performance in
communications.

FT  13 OCT 93 / International Company News: UAP, Suez end four-year struggle
over Colonia
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNION des Assurances de Paris (UAP) and Groupe Suez, two of the most
powerful groups in French finance, yesterday ended their four-year battle
for control of Colonia, the German insurance company.
Under yesterday's agreement, UAP - France's largest insurance group and a
prime candidate for privatisation - will take control of Colonia by buying a
majority stake in Vinci, the holding company that owns the international
activities of Victoire, a French insurer in which Suez has a majority stake.
UAP has valued the 59 per cent holding in Vinci - which owns a controlling
stake in Nieuw Rotterdam, the Dutch insurer, as well as 55 per cent of
Colonia - at FFr11.4bn (Dollars 2bn). As payment, it will cede to Suez its
34 per cent minority stake in Victoire, valued at FFr11bn.
In a parallel agreement, Victoire will cede its remaining 14.6 per cent
stake in Vinci to UAP, in return for a 5 per cent stake in the French
insurer.
UAP, which owns 5 per cent of Suez, has pre-emptive rights to buy the 21.2
per cent of Vinci owned by the Oppenheim group for DM1.2bn (Dollars 750m).
UAP and Suez have agreed to keep their 5 per cent cross-shareholdings for
three years.
The agreement marks the end of years of wrangling as Mr Jean Peyrelevade,
the chairman of UAP who is tipped as the next head of the Credit Lyonnais
banking group, has manoeuvred to win control of Colonia and fulfil his
ambition of taking UAP into the large German insurance market.
The negotiations have been marked by the personal tension between Mr
Peyrelevade, who was chairman of Suez during the late 1980s, and his former
subordinate, Mr Gerard Worms. UAP and Suez late last year almost agreed a
deal, only to fall out over the price. Mr Peyrelevade, anxious to resolve
the potentially embarrassing Colonia affair before UAP's privatisation and
his possible move to Credit Lyonnais, pressed for the talks to resume.
Suez announced static profits of FFr516m for the first half of this year,
against FFr528m for the same period of 1992. The group, which made a
FFr1.87bn net loss in 1992, confirmed Mr Patrick Ponsolle was resigning as
chief executive.

FT  13 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Expanding Ross drops to Pounds 0.6m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Adverse currency movements, a delay in receiving a large engineering
contract and a disappointing performance in consumer electronics all
contributed to depress first half profits at Ross Group.
The pre-tax line for the six months to June 30 was down from Pounds 1.35m to
Pounds 602,000, on turnover of Pounds 27.3m (Pounds 23.5m).
The shares fell 6p to 23p.
Earnings came out at 0.29p, against 0.73p (0.4p adjusting for profit from
the sale of properties in 1992). The interim dividend is held at 0.2p.
Ross is to buy two companies, Cascade and Keenon, from Tomei of Hong Kong
for Pounds 4m. Cascade is a consumer electronics company; Keenon provides
sourcing, shipping and inspection services in the Far East.
The consideration will be satisfied by the issue to Tomei of 13.3m new
shares at 30p. Tomei will also subscribe for an additional 2.3m shares worth
Pounds 700,000 to finance future expansion.

Securities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOWN CENTRE Securities, the Leeds-based property development group, lifted
pre-tax profits by almost 11 per cent from Pounds 7.25m to Pounds 8.04m over
the year to June 30.
Mr Edward Ziff, who was appointed managing director earlier this month, said
the group was lucky to hold most of its property in the north of England and
Scotland - 'outside the trauma of most of the property market.' Rental
growth had been 'only mediocre, but by today's standards any growth is
terrific news.'
Gross revenues rose from Pounds 16.9m to Pounds 18.2m, and operating profits
were ahead from Pounds 12.8m to Pounds 14.1m. Interest payable increased
from Pounds 5.58m to Pounds 6m. Gearing was 50.8 per cent at the group's
year-end, compared with 44.2 per cent.
About 65 per cent of the portfolio lies in the retail sector. Mr Ziff said
that for the first time in recent years the group had been able to buy good
quality retail properties and show an immediate return in relation to the
cost of borrowing.
Most of the remaining property is in the office market, which he described
as 'very difficult'.
An internal property valuation put values ahead by 1.4 per cent, giving
fully diluted net assets per share of 123.07p (118.32p).
Earnings per share were up from 5.12p to 5.59p. A final dividend of 2.3p is
proposed, giving a total for the year of 3.4p (3.1p).
The shares rose 4p to 137p.

Derwent Valley Holdings, the property group, hoisted pre-tax profits by 86
per cent from Pounds 603,000 to Pounds 1.12m in the first half of 1993.
The company pointed out that the results did not benefit from the share

Following the Pounds 16.9m issue of new shares, Derwent invested Pounds
10.3m in several properties, all of which are let on long leases. An office
building in Victoria was acquired for Pounds 1.8m, while the remaining
proceeds of Pounds 4.8m would be used for future purchases and refurbishment
of existing properties.
Net property revenue improved from Pounds 3.15m to Pounds 3.22m. Earnings
per share climbed from 5.2p to 9.9p, and an interim dividend of 3.05p (2.9p)
is declared on the increased capital.

<TEXT>
Transport Development Group said that it hoped to receive the outstanding
Dollars 14.3m (Pounds 9.4m) payment on its sale of Willig Freight Lines in
the US on or before November 30.
The purchasers had been due to pay Dollars 7.5m on September 30 with the
balance on November 30, but despite efforts to adhere to the sale terms,
they were unable to make the payment.
However, letters of intent, satisfactory to TDG, had been signed between the
purchasers and their potential financial partners which should enable the
single payment to be made on or before the end of next month. The sale to a
management team was first announced last November.

FT  13 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Virtuality valued at Pounds 44.4m in
placing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VIRTUALITY GROUP, the designer and manufacturer of virtual reality computer
games, is to obtain a full Stock Exchange listing by placing 7.43m shares at
170p each, to raise Pounds 9.45m net.
The funds will be used to provide additional working capital, to finance
product development, and to redeem outstanding preference shares.
Dealings in the shares are expected to commence on October 19. The placing
gives Virtuality - which was founded in 1987 - a market capitalisation of
Pounds 44.4m.
The biggest single shareholder will continue to be Apax Partners, the
venture capital company, at 50.9 per cent. The total holding by directors
will be 12.1 per cent. Other Virtuality employee holdings will amount to
some 5 per cent of the enlarged share capital. Motorola intends acquiring
3.8 per cent and IBM (Europe) 2.2 per cent.
Motorola and IBM's decision to invest in the company is thought to be
connected with its programme of developing home-based virtual reality
technology, aimed at bringing what is at present only available in games
arcades into the living room.
Virtuality currently has an installed base of some 360 game machines across
the world.
Mr Jon Waldern, managing director, said that the flotation and the capital
raised would enable it to continue developing high performance virtual
reality technology.
The total number of shares in issue following the placing is 26.1m; the
value of the shares being placed in this flotation is Pounds 12.6m. The
percentage of enlarged share capital being placed is 28.4 per cent.
The group had turnover of Pounds 5.24m in the 1992 year, with a pre-tax
profit of Pounds 217,000 and earnings per share of 1.1p.

FT  13 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Interim losses cut at Clinton Cards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLINTON CARDS, which claims 7.5 per cent of the greetings cards market,
against WH Smith's 7 per cent, reduced pre-tax losses from Pounds 1.29m to
Pounds 956,000 in the six months to July 31.
Losses per share emerged at 3.66p (4.94p); the interim dividend, however, is
lifted to 1.6p (1.5p). The shares fell 4p to 161p.
Mr Don Lewin, chairman, said that as long as the group had been expanding
the number of its outlets, first-half losses had been traditional. During
the six months, it opened 18 shops, bringing the total to 272. Mr Lewin said
the expansion 'was not slowing down, just cautious'.
Mr Barry Hartog, finance director, added that the additional shops had been
mostly on high streets and not in shopping centres, so there had been little
in the way of reverse premiums, which the group no longer enters into the
profit and loss account.
Turnover, including VAT, rose to Pounds 37.6m (Pounds 33.3m). Operating
losses shrank to Pounds 770,000 (Pounds 897,000). Net interest payable was
Pounds 186,000 (Pounds 393,000) - the group does not reveal borrowings
figures at the half-way stage, but Mr Hartog said they were down 40 per cent
over last time, though they peak in October in the run-up to Christmas, the
group's most important trading period.
Mr Lewin reckoned that any upturn in the UK economy had been patchy. The
amount that customers - more than 80 per cent of whom are women - spend had
remained stable, but the group depends on 'footfall': if the high streets
are emptier, then fewer customers cross the shops' thresholds.

FT  13 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Buoyant sales help Tie Rack advance to
Pounds 872,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUOYANT TRADING helped Tie Rack more than double pre-tax profits from Pounds
301,000 to Pounds 872,000 in the specialist retailer's seasonally weak first
half to August 15.
Sales rose from Pounds 25.3m to Pounds 33m as the company, which trades in
14 countries, moved into Germany and Switzerland, as well as franchising an
outlet in Austria.
'The healthy increase in profits has been generated by good sales growth in
the UK, Australia and continental Europe generally,' said Mr Roy Bishko,
chairman.
He said sales in the second half were satisfactory.
'We are fairly cautious about the rest of the year because we consider
consumer confidence is still fairly fragile and there are all sorts of
warning signs about the November budget which could not be worst timed for
retailers.'
Tie Rack, which claims 12 per cent of the fragmented Pounds 200m UK tie
market, increased outlets to 282 (262), an increase of 10 since the
beginning of the year, with 149 in the UK and 133 overseas.
Franchises are now less than 18 per cent of the total.
Since the half year end a further 10 shops had been opened and a further 12
were planned, the company said.
Operating profits jumped to Pounds 787,000 (Pounds 162,000).
Net cash balances were Pounds 6.9m (Pounds 768,000) at the half-way stage on
the back of strong profits performance over the last 12 months as well as
lower working capital.
Capital expenditure, at Pounds 1m (Pounds 500,000), had been lower than
depreciation charges.
The company has yet to pay last year's Pounds 2m tax charge which will be
paid in the second half.
Interest payments were Pounds 167,000 (Pounds 161,000).
Tie Rack expects to spend Pounds 3m developing the business over the full
year, including Pounds 500,000 as part of its Pounds 1.5m programme of
installing electronic funds transfer at point of sale technology in all
shops.
Earnings per share moved ahead from 0.38p to 1.05p.

FT  13 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Thorntons hit by French provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THORNTONS, the chocolate maker and retailer, was plunged deeply into the red
in the year to June 26 by the cost of restructuring lossmaking French
businesses and new accounting rules.
The company warned of the impending problems in May.
The loss was Pounds 4.8m against a pre-tax profit of Pounds 9.2m a year
earlier. Operating profits of Pounds 9.35m (Pounds 10.4m) were wiped out by
one-off provisions of Pounds 7.63m made against restructuring in France as
well as a Pounds 5.41m charge for goodwill previously written off to
reserves taken to the profit and loss account.
But the board, confident about the future, recommended a maintained final
dividend of 2.4p to give a same-again total of 3.65p. Losses per share were
11.94p (profits of 9.9p).
'The current year will see the benefit of the changes we made in the past
year to our management and organisational structure,' said Mr John Thornton,
chairman and chief executive.
Sales rose to Pounds 92.5m (Pounds 84.3m). 'On a like-for-like basis UK
sales were up 4.8 per cent. We are seeing the benefit of a lot of work on
our ranges and pricing points and believe this performance is good against
the broader retail background.'
In the UK and Belgium total sales rose 8.3 per cent to Pounds 81.9m giving
operating profits of Pounds 11.1m (Pounds 11.4m) as Thorntons opened a net
12 new shops and franchised 27 others. The company said start up and launch
costs associated with product development during the year had depressed UK
operating margins.
Total turnover in France was Pounds 10.6m (Pounds 8.73m) and operating
losses were Pounds 1.74m (Pounds 960,000). The company has appointed Mr John
Coyle as managing director, Europe. He is now based in Paris. The
restructured operation will consist of 35 confectionery and ice cream shops,
down from 60, concentrated in the Paris region.
Borrowings at the year end were Pounds 8.1m (Pounds 2m) giving gearing of 19
per cent (4 per cent). Interest payments climbed to Pounds 978,000 (Pounds
565,000).
COMMENT
Thorntons' French folly has now cost at least Pounds 20m including
accumulated losses and restructuring provisions. It bought lossmaking
businesses at the top of the market and then found profits resisted the
export of its management expertise and product lines. The company says the
pain is over now, with the remaining shops profitable in spite of the
downturn in France. Meanwhile, strength in the UK, where most of the
business is based, surprised some in the market, with last year's revamp of
the core ranges apparently paying off. Still, with analysts forecasting
profits of Pounds 11.5m, a multiple of 14 is a discount to other specialist
retailers but stands at a small premium to Cadbury Schweppes.

FT  13 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Roxboro predicts sharp upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROXBORO, the Newmarket-based manufacturer of specialist electronic
components which is coming to the market later this month, yesterday
forecast sharply higher trading and pre-tax profits for the current year.
The group, which issued its pathfinder prospectus yesterday, said trading
profits after central costs but before exceptional costs of Pounds 500,000,
related to the closure of a factory, would more than double to at least
Pounds 6.5m in the year to December 31. This compares with Pounds 3.1m last
year.
Pre-tax profits after net interest costs of Pounds 300,000 (Pounds 500,000)
were forecast to increase to Pounds 5.7m (Pounds 3.8m).
The profit improvement mainly reflects the positive effects of a
restructuring programme undertaken by Mr Harry Tee, Roxboro's chief
executive, after he led a management buy-out of the electronic components
division of Cambridge Electronic Industries (now Graseby) in mid-1990.
Since then Mr Tee has improved productivity and refocused Roxboro away from
low-margin commodity components and towards production of higher-margin
value-added devices through its two core businesses, BLP in the UK and
Dialight in the US.
As a result, trading margins have risen from 7.6 per cent in the year of the
buy-out to 16.4 per cent in the 1993 first half.
The offer for sale and placing with institutional investors is expected to
raise about Pounds 50m and value the company at about Pounds 80m. Some 35
per cent of the shares on offer will be available to the public.
Schroder Ventures, which backed the management buy-out, will receive Pounds
25.5m gross of the proceeds and retain a 20 per cent stake in the enlarged
group. Roxboro's management will also retain a 20 per cent stake after
raising Pounds 10.5m from the offer.
The offer will also raise up to Pounds 15m for the company itself which will
be used to repay debt and other borrowings and to fund the group's plans for
expansion. After the flotation Roxboro will have about Pounds 5.1m of net
cash.
Pricing is set for October 26 and is expected to reflect a prospective
multiple of about 18 which would represent a moderate discount to comparable
stocks like Bowthorpe and Telemetrix.
The sponsor is Samuel Montague and dealings are expected to begin on
November 10.

FT  13 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Greycoat receives financing approaches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREYCOAT, the property company struggling to fend off receivership, said
yesterday it had received a number of approaches regarding a possible
financial restructuring.
One has come from the UK Active Value Fund, advised by corporate financiers
Mr Brian Myerson and Mr Julian Treger and controlling 18 per cent of
Greycoat's ordinary shares.
Greycoat's adviser, N M Rothschild, said it had received at least two
approaches, but that all but the UK Active Value Fund had declined to be
identified.
The company also said it had received notice from the Law Debenture Trust,
trustee of Greycoat's Pounds 50m zero coupon bonds, that it had 30 days to
rectify the breach of the gearing covenant.
Greycoat's bond and shareholders last Friday rejected a Pounds 120m
refinancing package from Postel, the UK's largest pension fund. The company
has been in breach of its gearing covenants on the Pounds 50m of zero coupon
bonds since Postel's offer was published in September.
Rothschild had expected the Law Debenture Trust to issue the 30-day notice -
which is not a demand for payment - on Monday. If after 30 days, the gearing
is not reduced or an alternative refinancing plan is not forthcoming, the
trustees of the zero coupon bond are likely to issue a default notice. This
would trigger action from other creditors.

FT  13 OCT 93 / UK Company News: FR falls 5% to Pounds 10.4m and warns on
second six months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FR GROUP, the maker of in-flight refuelling equipment, yesterday
disappointed the market with a 5 per cent fall in interim pre-tax profits
and a larger fall in earnings, partly due to an increase in the tax charge.
Mr Gordon Page, chief executive, said that the cost of redundancies
announced in August at Flight Refuelling and some closure costs would mean
the next six month period was unlikely to produce results materially
different from the first half.
For the six months to June 30 pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 11m to Pounds
10.4m, on sales ahead 2 per cent at Pounds 86.9m. Earnings per share fell
from 10.2p to 9.01p and the interim dividend is unchanged at 2.46p.
The group also announced the Pounds 13m acquisition of High Temperature
Engineers, a company that makes aerospace components similar to those
produced by Flight Refuelling.
Mr Page said the acquisition should give the group critical mass in fuel
systems. It would double Flight Refuelling's aircraft fuel systems business.
Flight Refuelling suffered from lower demand for civil aerospace products
worldwide and a fall in defence procurement spending and some delays in the
placing of contracts. Stanley Aviation, which supplies engine positioners to
the USAF, experienced technical difficulties.
FR was also hit by falling demand from the Dutch armed forces for ammunition
containers and has decided to close part of its Markhorst business in the
Netherlands.
Mr Page said that the other businesses, comprising about 66 per cent of the
group's sales, were doing well. Redundancy costs in the second half should
be about Pounds 1.4m.
FR also said it has exchanged a contact to buy the assets of the life
support products division of Aro Corporation, a subsidiary of
Ingersoll-Rand. It is paying about Dollars 9.5m (Pounds 6.3m) and completion
is expected later this year.
FR's shares closed 19p lower at 232p.
COMMENT
In the short term it is difficult to get excited about FR's prospects.
Despite being well placed with niche military and aerospace products these
results demonstrate that both markets are vulnerable to postponement of
customers' programmes. Granted the Ministry of Defence should decide to go
with the Phoenix programme after the budget, with positive impact on
profitability next year. And the HTE acquisition has for the first time
given FR a critical mass in fuel systems that could be developed. But with
the uncertainty surrounding timing of its contracts, a prospective multiple
of about 12.8, on profits of Pounds 20.8m, is a correct rating.

FT  13 OCT 93 / UK Company News: William Sinclair down 17% to Pounds 3.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILLIAM Sinclair Holdings, a supplier of products to the garden, leisure and
pet markets, yesterday reported profits down 17 per cent at Pounds 3.82m.
This was in line with its warning on June 28 that profits for the year to
June 30 would be 15-20 per cent below last time's Pounds 4.61m.
However, under FRS 3, the profit and loss account showed that pre-tax
profits increased from a restated Pounds 2.96m, after an aggregate Pounds
1.45m exceptional charge in the restated 1992 figures for two disposals.
Interest receivable was sharply cut to Pounds 146,000 (Pounds 345,000),
partly as a result of lower interest rates and partly because cash balances
declined to Pounds 6m (Pounds 7.5m), after the payment of the cash element
of the acquisition of Secto.
Mr Tom Sinclair, chairman, described the year as 'one of mixed fortunes'.
The group's profits shortfall was due to 'the cold and wet weather
conditions' affecting the horticultural division. Operating profits here
declined to Pounds 2.29m (Pounds 3.14m) on turnover of Pounds 27.1m (Pounds
26.9m).
The almost doubled rainfall in Scotland led to a poor peat harvest and the
need to buy peat from other suppliers for Sinclair's J Arthur Bowers
products. However, market share was increased across Bowers' three products:
compost up to 19.1 (17.1) per cent; bark to 14.5 (6.5) per cent; and
fertiliser to 31.7 (28.4) per cent.
On the pet, aquatics and household products side profits grew 41 per cent to
Pounds 1.38m (Pounds 977,000) on turnover of Pounds 11.4m (Pounds 8.76m).
Group exports expanded to Pounds 3.4m (Pounds 2.87m), with pet products
going mainly to Europe and horticultural products to the Middle and Far
East.
Earnings under FRS 3 grew to 12.2p (8.3p) per share, though on the headline
profits basis, they fell to 11.9p (14.8p). The final dividend is held at
5.3p for a maintained 7p total.

FT  13 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Go-ahead for ASH scrip plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY and DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUTOMATED Security (Holdings), the alarm leasing group, has gone ahead with
its enhanced scrip dividend despite a sharp fall in its share price since it
fixed the reference price a week ago, as a result of a profit warning last
Friday.
The Stock Exchange still has to announce whether it is admitting the new
shares to the Official List, although admission is normally a formality.
The group said the scheme was approved at a board meeting yesterday. Going
ahead with the scrip saves ASH Pounds 4m through a Pounds 3.1m cash saving
on the dividend payment and a Pounds 900,000 reduction in advance
corporation tax payable. ASH said it was in the interests of the company and
its shareholders to proceed.
Under the terms of the scheme, shareholders were offered an interim dividend
of 3.03p in cash or 4.58p payable in new shares. Its share price fell 30p to
102p on Friday and yesterday closed at 97p, down 6p on the day. At this
level, tax-paying shareholders would almost have been better off taking the
cash dividend rather than the enhanced scrip.
A reference price of 142p a share was set by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, parent
of de Zoete &amp; Bevan, then one of ASH's joint brokers, at the market close on
Tuesday last week, relating to the share price over the previous two hours.
At this price, 3.21m shares needed to be issued to satisfy the 87.5 per cent
take up of the enhanced scrip.
The broker then auctioned 892,000 of the new shares which investors had
elected to sell at a strike price of 136p, 95.8 per cent of the reference
price.
On Friday last week, ASH warned that its third quarter profits would be hit
by Pounds 3m of exceptional costs. De Zoete &amp; Bevan resigned as joint broker
to ASH on Friday when the company refused to either cancel or amend the
terms of the scrip offer.
As foreshadowed by last Friday's warning, ASH's pre-tax profits for the nine
months ending August 31, announced yesterday after the market closed, were
sharply down, falling by 75 per cent to Pounds 9.17m.
Total operating profit fell from Pounds 22.8m to Pounds 15.2m. However, this
time there was a charge on discontinued operations of Pounds 2.1m incurred
through the closure of the fire systems division. Previously discontinued
operations contributed Pounds 5.5m.
The latest pre-tax figure included restructuring costs of Pounds 1.1m
(Pounds 3.7m) and interest payments of Pounds 4.9m (Pounds 12.6m). The
comparable figure also included a profit of Pounds 30.3m on the sale of the
group's loss prevention subsidiary.
Total group turnover fell from Pounds 135m to Pounds 118m, although the
previous figure included Pounds 46.4m from discontinued operations compared
with Pounds 9.1m this time.
Earnings fell from 21.5p to 2p. The tax charge was down from Pounds 7.56m to
Pounds 1.5m, reflecting the saving on ACT through the enhanced scrip
dividend scheme.

<TEXT>
MARKS AND Spencer aims to break new ground by opening a franchise operation
in Turkey. The country's economy grew faster than any in Europe last year.
The company, which has previously concentrated its franchises in North
America and continental Europe said it was looking for a Turkish partner
with the financial muscle for a retail operation with annual turnover of at
least Pounds 50m.
'We believe there are opportunities for our particular formula in Turkey,'
the company said yesterday.
The operation, in line with recent successful franchises in Hungary and
Austria, would start by retailing ladies' lingerie and toiletries. The
project is a pilot scheme. Initially, the stores would be about 2,000 sq ft,
compared with about 30,000 for a UK branch.
Risk capital would be provided by the Turkish franchisee, while Marks and
Spencer would supply merchandise.
Turkey's consumer market is driven by rising personal incomes, fast
urbanisation and rapid changes in consumer taste, with importance attached
to brand names and packaging.
Retails chains currently account for 7 per cent of the market nationally and
about 12 per cent in the big cities, Istanbul, Izmir and Ankara.

FT  13 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Doubts rise over enhanced scrips - Their
prospects following the ASH debacle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE furore over Automated Security's profit warning and enhanced scrip
dividend, which led to de Zoete &amp; Bevan, its joint broker, resigning in high
dudgeon last Friday, has reinforced doubts about the whole notion of
enhanced scrips.
When these beasts first arrived in the corporate finance menagerie in March
 -invented by BZW, de Zoete &amp; Bevan's parent - they were seen as a clever
way for companies with surplus advance corporation tax to cut their tax
bill.
At first it was suggested that enhanced scrips would be offered by only a
few companies which were suffering surplus ACT because they derived a large
part of their profits from outside the UK, and probably only on one
occasion. But the list of companies offering these devices has lengthened,
and some have come back with a second issue.
Enhanced scrips offer shareholders a dividend in shares at a rate 50 per
cent higher than the cash value of the payment. Share dividends do not
attract ACT, while cash dividends do.
If investors take up the enhanced scrip, the company saves ACT and retains
the cash that would otherwise be paid in dividend.
Investors getting a higher dividend were reckoned to be happy too.
Non-taxpaying investors cannot reclaim tax on an enhanced scrip, but the
higher payout more than compensates them. Take-up rates for enhanced scrips
have been high, often 90 per cent or more.
But some investors fear companies will repeatedly offer enhanced scrips,
which in effect become a rolling rights issue - the company is raising money
by issuing shares.
Yet the safeguards demanded by the Stock Exchange for rights issues - in
terms of the information required in a rights-issue document, such as
working capital and current trading statements - do not apply to enhanced
scrips. The level of due diligence carried out by the advisers is far lower,
even though the risk period is longer. Rights issues typically take three
weeks from announcement to completion, while ASH's enhanced scrip was
announced in mid-July and will be completed today.
Bankers respond that the same safeguards need not apply, because enhanced
scrips increase a company's share capital by perhaps 3 or 4 per cent,
compared with a rights issue which might expand the equity base by a quarter
or a third.
Further, some companies which have offered enhanced scrips seem to be using
them not to get round a structural tax problem but as an alternative to
cutting a dividend which they have not got the cash to pay. But the result
is they have yet more shares on which to pay dividends.
Forte, the hotel group, combined a cut dividend with an enhanced scrip.
Lucas Industries, which announced an enhanced scrip on Monday with its
annual results, would have had to pay a cash dividend from reserves.
So what went wrong with ASH's enhanced scrip? Essentially, Friday's profit
warning drove down ASH's share price, putting the company in the position of
issuing shares at a price far out of line with the market price. Worse, from
BZW's viewpoint, the broker had sold some of the new shares to its clients
only days before the warning.
In enhanced scrips, shareholders are not just offered the choice of a cash
dividend or a larger share dividend. They have a further option to take the
dividend in shares, but then sell the new shares, getting at least a
guaranteed price through an underwriting arrangement with the company's
broker.
In ASH's case BZW underwrote the new shares at a price of 95 per cent of the
reference price, the price used to calculate the number of shares to be
issued to meet the dividend payment.
With hindsight, this underwriting price might have been a warning. When
enhanced scrips were invented, the underwriting price was typically set at
95 per cent of the reference price. But this discount rapidly attracted
competition from other houses, led by Swiss Bank Corporation, willing to
underwrite closer to the reference price.
Now houses bid for the underwriting and the guaranteed price can be as high
as 99 per cent of the reference price. Further, houses attempt to sell the
shares above the underwriting price through an auction, giving the selling
shareholders 'best execution' and cutting the profit which the brokers could
make on the underwriting.
It was not till Thursday last week that ASH told BZW it was concerned about
some of the numbers it was seeing when collecting figures for its third
quarter results, which were published yesterday.
BZW advised ASH to make a trading statement, which ASH did on Friday
morning, and also to either cancel or adjust the price for the enhanced
scrip. ASH refused to do the latter within the time limit BZW had set,
leading the broker to resign.
The question of enhanced scrips may vanish after the next month's Budget.
This is expected to clarify a proposal in the spring Budget for a system of
paying ACT-free dividends from foreign income.
If the main structural problem causing surplus ACT is ironed out by the
budget, companies which persist with enhanced scrips thereafter would be
exposed as using them for other reasons. These may be the dubious ones that
their dividends have not stayed in line with the profits available to pay
for them, in which case a dividend cut rather than an enhanced scrip is the
answer.
Investors would look closely at a company's motives for offering an enhanced
scrip before accepting, and the animal may die a natural death.

FT  13 OCT 93 / UK Company News: US concerns hit Micro Focus / A look at the
worries behind the fall of a software star
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MARKET value of Micro Focus has fallen sharply over the past few weeks
as US investors question the company's ability to maintain its hitherto
impressive record for growth and profitability.
Last night shares in the Berkshire-based software house closed at Pounds
13.33 in thin trading having lost 25 per cent of their value in the past
seven days alone. They stood at just over Pounds 30 in February this year.
The company is now capitalised at Pounds 188m compared with over Pounds 400m
at its peak.
The share price was not helped by a sell note last week from a US analyst,
Mr Paul Bloom, of brokers Volpe, Welty &amp; Co, a company which in earlier
years had praised Micro Focus' management and market positioning. Mr Paul
O'Grady, Micro Focus managing director, said Mr Bloom had issued the note
without consultation with the company
In the UK, however, analysts were not reassured by a round of presentations
last week from Mr O'Grady. He seemed 'downbeat' and had failed to impress UK
shareholders.
Micro Focus is a company whose stock is at the mercy of its American
Depositary Receipt listing. At one stage almost 40 per cent of its shares
were held in the form of ADRs; now the total is about 20 per cent. US
investment has been behind the dramatic rise in Micro Focus' share price
over the past three years. Now it is the root cause of its collapse.
US investors understand the software market better than their European
counterparts. Micro Focus had powerful appeal because it had developed a set
of tools - software which makes it easier to write other software - which
were of obvious value in corporate data centres. They made it possible to
write software in Cobol, the most common business language, on cheap
personal computers rather than taking up expensive mainframe time. Micro
Focus has an alliance with Microsoft, the world's largest software company,
through which Micro Focus tools are included in Microsoft products.
Mainframes, however, are gradually giving way to networks of smaller
computers (client-server systems) and Cobol will eventually be superseded by
more modern computer languages: the question hanging over Micro Focus has
always been: when?
So US investors began to take fright when the company recorded flat profits
and a mere 11 per cent rise in revenues in dollar terms in the first half of
the year. Typically Micro Focus has grown both revenues and profits by more
than 20 per cent. In sterling terms, revenues were Pounds 40.8m and pre-tax
profits Pounds 11.6m for the first half.
US investors also noted poor performances from traditional mainframe vendors
such as Amdahl and concluded the shift to client-server systems was under
way.
Mr O'Grady said yesterday that Micro Focus was well positioned to exploit
moves to newer technology.
UK analysts agreed yesterday that little had changed in the company's
underlying trading performance and were maintaining estimates of pre-tax
profits for the full year at between Pounds 27m and Pounds 30m. The company
has Pounds 53m cash.

SUN ALLIANCE, the composite insurance group, yesterday raised Pounds 125m
through a placement of cumulative irredeemable preference shares.
The issue, which was foreshadowed when the company reported its results for
the first half of 1993 in September, will strengthen the capital base at a
time of rising insurance rates in the UK.
Sun Alliance said the money would also allow the growth of its business
overseas.
It obtained shareholders' permission to raise up to Pounds 300m in
preference shares at an extraordinary meeting last month.
Cazenove and SG Warburg placed the issue.
Sun Alliance reported a profit before tax of Pounds 61.7m in the first six
months of 1993.

FT  13 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Plysu sharesfall 20p on warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Plysu, the maker of plastic bottles, fell 20p to 220p after the
company warned profits would be well below market expectations.
Mr Stephen Nobbs, finance director, said Plysu was comfortable with its
brokers' downgrading of pre-tax profits for the year from the Pounds 12m
previously forecast to Pounds 8m.
Plysu said it had successfully concluded negotiations with leading UK dairy
groups for the supply of milk and juice bottles. The negotiations had,
however, taken three to four months longer than anticipated which would have
a temporary adverse effect on profits this year.
Profits would be 'well below market expectations' but it remained confident
that prospects for subsequent years were excellent.
On the new profits forecast Plysu is trading on a prospective multiple for
the year of about 20, described by one analyst as allowing little scope for
further delays in the economic recovery.

FT  13 OCT 93 / UK Company News: St Ives rises but shows concern over VAT
threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ST IVES, the UK's largest independent printer, yesterday reported a 4.8 per
cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 22.1m for the 52 weeks to July
30.
However, Mr Miles Emley, presenting his first set of results since
succeeding Mr Robert Gavron as chairman in May, said there had been little
improvement in most of the group's markets and warned that the threat of
imposition of VAT in the UK on some of its products 'represents a continuing
uncertainty.'
The Pounds 1m improvement in profits came from turnover ahead by 6.4 per
cent to Pounds 221.3m.
Earnings per share were unchanged at 15.2p. The recommended final dividend
is increased to 4p (3.75p) making a 5.5p (5.25p) total.
Profit margins at both the pre-interest and pre-tax levels were almost
static at 9.5 per cent and 10 per cent respectively which Mr Emley said was
'a creditable result in trading conditions which have been far from easy.'
He added that the modest recovery in the UK economy that was experienced
towards the end of the financial year had been mainly export-led and had not
benefited the group.
The overall returns in the group's core UK magazine business were lower than
in the previous year although Mr Emley said the downward pressure on prices
had eased and in some cases the group had been able to agree price increases
'modestly in excess of inflation.'
Conditions in the group's US markets, which account for 10 per cent of
turnover, deteriorated in the second half leading to markedly lower volumes
 -particularly in medical titles which were affected by the US government's
healthcare review.
Among St Ives other operations the book printing business boosted sales and,
based on the group's reputation for thin paper printing, lifted its share of
the international bible and reference book market.
Looking ahead Mr Emley said: 'It is still too early to judge whether the
current increase in activity represents more than a seasonal upturn.'
COMMENT
St Ives' results were in line with market expectations; however, Mr Emley's
comments were cautious and the shares closed 3p lower at 299p, down from a
peak of 346p in the spring. Shareholders' funds were just short of Pounds
100m at the year-end and the group had Pounds 21.6m of net cash, up from
Pounds 13.5m a year earlier. Capital spending this year will be about Pounds
20m and, like the Pounds 106.9m spent in the past five years, will be
financed from cash flow. The UK printing market remains tough and the US
business is still losing money. But with a bit of a struggle pre-tax profits
should reach Pounds 24m this year producing earnings of 16.4p and a
prospective p/e of slightly over 18.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Absolut loss for GrandMet in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRAND Metropolitan is to lose US distribution rights to Absolut vodka, the
Swedish-owned premium brand, which has become one of the world's
best-selling spirits over the past 13 years.
Vin &amp; Sprit, the Swedish wine and spirits company, yesterday announced that
Seagram, the North American drinks group, would take over distribution of
Absolut in the US. It would also take over distribution in other world
markets as soon as contracts allowed.
The reason for the switch appears to have been growing doubts at V &amp; S about
the future development of Absolut alongside GrandMet's own Smirnoff and
Popov brands. The decision shocked GrandMet's IDV drinks division. It was
informed only 24 hours earlier. Up to then, it had been engaged in the usual
review of its US distribution arrangements with V &amp; S which were due for
renewal next September.
Mr John McGrath, chairman and chief executive of IDV, said that the company,
in 'an excellent and mutually beneficial partnership' with V &amp; S, had
developed Absolut in the US from negligible sales in 1980 to almost 3m cases
a year.
'Given this impressive track record, and the successful co-existence and
compatibility of Absolut alongside IDV's portfolio of other US brands,
including Smirnoff and Popov, it is all the more surprising that V &amp; S
should take this decision.'
Absolut is ranked 17th in the world's best-selling spirits and is the fifth
largest brand in GrandMet's portfolio. Analysts estimate it was worth about
Pounds 25m a year in profits. Its loss hit GrandMet's shares which fell 15p
to close at 403p. Seagram shares rose Dollars 1/4 to Dollars 26 1/4 at
midday.
Mr Claes Dahlback, V &amp; S chairman, said: 'The potential for Absolut vodka
and the resources of Seagram make a perfect business match: a worldwide
premium brand and a worldwide premium brand marketer and distributor.'
For Seagram, which does not have an international vodka brand in its
portfolio, the capture of Absolut is a coup.
Mr Edgar Bronfman, Seagram's president, said: 'We are very excited to have
the opportunity and responsibility to join forces with V &amp; S to develop
further and realise the full potential of Absolut.'

FT  13 OCT 93 / Wal-Mart strategy hit by ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WAL-MART STORES, the US discount store giant, yesterday suffered a blow to
its retailing strategy when an Arkansas court ruled that it had broken state
law by selling a range of pharmaceutical products below cost.
The ruling could have ripple effects throughout the US retailing industry by
encouraging a series of similar legal suits against Wal-Mart and other store
groups which price aggressively to win market share.
Wal-Mart said it was 'extremely disappointed' by what it termed an
'anti-consumer' ruling and said it would immediately appeal to the Arkansas
Supreme Court. Its shares fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 26.
The civil suit was brought by three independent pharmacies in Conway,
Arkansas, who claimed they were suffering from low prices offered by
Wal-Mart on items from toothpaste to over-the-counter drugs at its Conway
store.
The pharmacies said Wal-Mart's pricing policies were in breach of the
Arkansas Unfair Practices Act, which forbids the sale of merchandise below
cost 'for the purposes of injuring competitors and destroying competition'.
They claimed Dollars 1.1m in damages. Wal-Mart acknowledged that it sold
some items below cost, but argued that this was part of normal retailing
practice and was not intended to destroy competition.
The court, however, found against Wal-Mart and ordered it to pay a total of
Dollars 96,469 in damages to the three pharmacies.
Wal-Mart has become America's biggest retailer by competing aggressively
with smaller stores on price. Independents have often accused it of selling
goods below cost to put them out of business, then raising prices once the
competition had disappeared.
The company has lost at least one other case of predatory pricing, in an
Oklahoma state court in 1986. As a result, it agreed to raise prices in the
state. This latest case is likely to encourage a flurry of suits against the
company in the 22 other states with similar pricing statutes.
Announcing its decision to fight the ruling, Wal-Mart said: 'If this
decision is allowed to stand, the result will be higher prices - not just
for Wal-Mart customers, but customers of every retail store, large and
small, in Arkansas.'

FT  13 OCT 93 / Unravelling the puzzle of real bond yields
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH investors may remember the record 5 per cent real yield which was
briefly featured by index-linked gilts just before the UK's exit from the
European exchange rate mechanism last year.
That yield has now collapsed to 3.1 per cent, a change which has been
fundamental to the strength of all the financial asset markets over the past
13 months.
Such a yield adjustment has been reflected in big price rises on
index-linked gilts. The longest-dated example, redeemable in 2030, has risen
by 33 per cent since shortly before Black Wednesday. More importantly, the
fall in real yields has created headroom for the equity market, allowing the
dividend yield on UK equities to drop below 4 per cent and still allow a
premium for risk.
The UK is rare in having a financial instrument which encapsulates the
concept of the real yield. The fall in real returns is, however, not a
domestic but a global phenomenon. According to Barclays de Zoete Wedd the
real return on 10-year government bonds across the Group of Ten countries
averaged some 5 per cent during the 1980s but has now declined to about 3
per cent, or possibly 2.8 per cent on the basis of a consensus expectation
of inflation next year.
The process has gone furthest in the US, where the real yield on this basis
appears to be only about 2.2 per cent. In countries such as France and Spain
the figure is about twice as high, a differential which ought to be
unsustainable in free-flowing international capital markets.
However, in the absence of index-linked securities the concept of a real
return is not wholly robust, and depends upon bondholders' expectations of
inflation which may be too pessimistic.
And clearly there is something unusual about the US bond market at present,
shored up as it is by the banks, which are operating on the basis of a
profitable spread over America's rock bottom short-term interest rates and
are scarcely concerned at all with real yields, as a long-term investor
should be.
Japan is a particularly interesting case. With 10-year bond yields down to
3.8 per cent, and inflation liable to disappear completely, it is closer
than any other country to a 1930s-type scenario. In the first half of the
1930s the real yield on UK gilts averaged about 7 per cent a year, a
perverse figure for a slump, and one that arose because prices were actually
falling.
Internationally, real returns were very high during the 1980s. Investors
were determined not to be caught again by the inflation of the 1970s,
although in the event inflation declined until about 1987.
Real rates then dipped, but rose again at the beginning of the 1990s, when
the US continued to borrow on a massive scale and Germany unexpectedly
joined it in heavy deficit after reunification. There was talk of a global
famine of capital as real bond yields peaked in the summer of 1992.
Given the international recession, however, it has not worked out like that.
The Bundesbank has bludgeoned the German reunification boom into submission.
The Federal Reserve has pumped liquidity into the US economy but has
generated only a stuttering recovery. There turns out to have been plenty of
capital, enough not only to finance the deficits but to generate a roaring
global bull market in bonds.
Nominal 10-year interest rates have dropped by nearly 2 percentage points
for the Group of Ten countries since mid-1992, and since inflation has
changed little (and is not expected to fall much below 3 per cent next year
either) the effect can nearly all be attributed to the fall in real returns.
How much further can this trend go? Real yields are low, but not
exceptionally so. Over the past 30 years real bond returns in the US, Japan
and Germany appear to have averaged about 2.5 per cent; exclude the 1970s,
when the real yield was negative in the US and Japan (but not in Germany)
and 3 per cent would be more typical.
With global GDP growth running at only about 1 per cent against potential
trend output growth of perhaps 2 1/2 per cent there is still considerable
slack. Although we may be nearing the trough for real returns, we probably
have not got there yet. But if recovery were to become more general next
year there could be a rapid increase in capital market pressures.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Murdoch plans bonus issue of 'super' shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR RUPERT MURDOCH's News Corporation, the Australian-based media, film and
publishing group, yesterday announced plans to create a new class of shares
with 'super' voting rights, which would be issued on a one for one basis to
existing shareholders.
The proposals, announced at News Corp's annual meeting in Adelaide, could
allow the company to issue further ordinary shares in pursuit of expansion
or debt reduction without diluting control.
The level of equity controlled by Mr Murdoch - either directly or through
his family company, Cruden Investments - has fallen from 45 per cent to 32.7
per cent since 1990 as a result of equity-related issues.
Yesterday's announcement seemed to surprise the Australian Stock Exchange.
Shares with 'super' voting rights have never featured in Australia. One
official said the proposal raised fundamental investment issues and the ASX
would need to canvass the financial community's opinion.
As the plan would tend to lock in the existing voting interests at News
Corp, it would also leave the group well defended against potential
predators.
Mr Murdoch told shareholders: 'We believe that, if we are successful in
increasing News Corporation's capital base through the issue of equity, it
must be done in a manner that continues current management.
'If we are to continue to grow and prosper and meet the demand of the
technological age in which we live, it is important to ensure that the
management that brought News Corporation to this point, be available to lead
it in the future,' he added.
At the meeting, Mr Murdoch forecast a profit increase of about 20 per cent
for the first quarter of the current financial year.
He defended News Corp's decision to slash the price of its two UK daily
newspapers, The Times and The Sun. 'The pricing of all newspapers in Britain
over the last five to 10 years has been well ahead of inflation. We were
pricing ourselves out of the market.'
He predicted that BSkyB, of which News Corp owns half and in which Pearson,
publisher of the Financial Times, also has a stake, should make at least
Pounds 180m operating profit this year.
But the recent acquisition of the New York Post - the tabloid daily
previously in bankruptcy - would do nothing to help the bottom line. 'We
will probably lose in the range of USDollars 5m a year, maybe as high as
USDollars 10m.'
News Corp was still interested in magazine publishing in the US, despite the
sale of titles two years ago. It was also 'on the lookout' to buy more
television stations, adding to the eight already owned. 'We will be able to
buy, within the law, two more stations and then be covering about 25 per
cent of the US.'

FT  13 OCT 93 / Clash of style behind Guinness departure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CRISPIN DAVIS, managing director of United Distillers, the Guinness
spirits division, yesterday resigned from the group by mutual agreement.
The surprise move comes during a troubled period for Guinness. It is under
pressure from declining profits and from questions about its marketing
strategy and partnership with LVMH, the embattled French group.
Mr Davis's departure, after little more than a year as head of UD, was said
to be due to a personality clash with Mr Tony Greener, Guinness's chairman
and chief executive.
Their relationship was affected by differences in management style and
approach. It is understood Mr Davis's outgoing manner contrasted strongly
with Mr Greener's reticence.
Industry observers, including some of UD's competitors, suggest that the
differences were reflected in marketing strategy. While Mr Greener, with his
background at Dunhill, maintained absolute faith in building premium brands,
competitors were bewildered to find UD cutting the prices of some products.
Its decision to reduce the strength of Gordon's gin was widely seen as a
serious marketing error.
Such tactics were attributed to Mr Davis's marketing experience with Procter
&amp; Gamble. 'He was basically a commodity marketer,' said one rival.
At a recent City presentation, a slide showing a hand grasping a bottle of
UD's Scotch on a supermarket shelf was followed by a slide in which the hand
clutched a bottle of P&amp;G shampoo.
Mr Davis took over as head of UD in July last year. He was recruited from
P&amp;G in 1990 as managing director of UD's European operations.
He had a successful career at P&amp;G, joining as an assistant brand manager and
rising rapidly to become UK marketing director. He ran the German operation
before becoming US vice-president of the food division.
He was paid about Pounds 250,000 a year at UD, where he was on a three-year
rolling contract. Compensation is being negotiated.
While Guinness searches for a successor from outside the group, UD's
executives will report to Mr Greener. The group reiterated yesterday that
there would be no change in strategy.
But the pressures persist. Market disappointment at a decline of 9 per cent
in first-half profits was compounded by Mr Greener's forecast of flat
profits for the full year and only modest improvements in 1994.
Mr Greener asserted that there was no intention of abandoning its
international premium pricing policy. 'To move our brands downwards would
put us on a slippery slope from which we would never recover.'
Guinness's difficulties have not been helped by the battering taken recently
by shares in LVMH, whose profits have been hit by depressed champagne and
cognac markets. Speculation persists, in spite of Guinness's constant
denials, that the alliance is crumbling. Lex, Page 18

FT  13 OCT 93 / Oftel measures aim to increase competition in telecom market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RANGE of initiatives to speed up competition in the telecommunications
market was unveiled yesterday by Mr Don Cruickshank, director general of
Oftel, the industry regulator.
Mr Cruickshank said the measures would enable rivals of British
Telecommunications to establish themselves more rapidly. In the next five
years he expected competitors would invest Pounds 5bn-Pounds 6bn in the UK -
roughly half BT's rate of investment.
The dozen initiatives cover issues such as portability of telephone numbers,
publication of BT's previously confidential market information and access
for competitors to BT's directory inquiries database. Although many measures
are technical, Oftel believes that collectively they will make a big
difference to the development of competition.
Mr Cruickshank was speaking following an industry-wide forum held on Monday
in London to discuss arrangements for competitors to connect their networks
to BT's. The meeting was attended by 18 operators including BT, Mercury
Communications, several cable television companies and American Telephone
and Telegraph, the largest US telecoms group. Both Oftel and BT said
progress had been made but further discussions would be needed.
Mr Cruickshank said he did not expect strong resistance from BT to his
agenda for promoting competition. He said BT had an interest in showing
there were no obstacles to fair competition in the UK, not least because of
its ambition to gain access to foreign markets.
Some of the initiatives are still under discussion but final decisions on
whether to press ahead will be taken over the next six to nine months. The
main ideas are:
Interconnection - Oftel is working on determining a standard menu of
interconnection charges that competitors would have to pay BT for using its
network. It is also considering specifying service levels and technical
standards that BT would have to abide by when providing interconnection
services; Number portability, which would allow people switching from BT to
another local operator to keep their numbers; Market information - Oftel
will publish information detailing market shares in different segments of
the industry; Equal access which would allow customers with BT lines to use
the long-distance services of rival operators as easily as BT's services;
Opening BT's directory inquiry database to competitors.

THE GERMAN federal constitutional court yesterday cleared away the last
legal obstacle to the ratification of the Maastricht treaty on European
union.
The court's ruling was greeted with relief in European capitals, allaying
fears that the German judicial authorities might impose conditions
incompatible with the treaty which is set to become European law from
November 1.
The court in Karlsruhe rejected the challenges to the treaty as either
inadmissible or unsubstantiated, in a fundamental decision defining
Germany's future attitude to European integration.
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, said ratification
of the Maastricht treaty would end a long period of uncertainty for the EC.
But he warned: 'We cannot forget that the preoccupation of Europe today
remains the recession and the growth in unemployment.'
Mr Delors avoided any note of triumphalism, a reflection of how divisive the
ratification battles have been in Denmark, France, the UK and, latterly,
Germany since the treaty was signed in December 1991.
'If we continue like this, failing to recognise the benefits of a European
construction, losing our ideals and the will to achieve them . . . we will
be marginalised,' Mr Delors, one of Maastricht's architects, said in an
interview on German ZDF television.
'We must stop splitting hairs, being morose . . . we must resume moving
forward,' he said.
Within hours, the German ratification law had been signed by President
Richard von Weizsacker, and was dispatched last night by diplomatic courier
to be deposited in Rome.
The decision was welcomed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who had staked his
political reputation on the treaty and the European integration process. He
said it was now urgent to proceed with the programme set out in the treaty.
Belgium, president of the EC, announced that the planned special summit on
October 29 would go ahead.
Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgian prime minister, said the meeting would put into
force the treaty's provisions covering the second phase of European economic
and monetary union; common security and foreign policy; and co-operation on
crime and justice matters.
EC leaders will try to reach a summit deal on the site of the European
Monetary Institute, the precursor of the European Central Bank, as well as
other sites such as the European environmental agency and Europol. Germany
remains the leading candidate for the EMI, with Amsterdam staging a late
bid.
The eight German judges decided that the process of European union did not
conflict with the principles of democracy enshrined in the German
constitution, thanks to national democratic controls implicit in the
Maastricht treaty.

FT  13 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Spirits market
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In their different ways developments at Grand Metropolitan and Guinness are
reminders of how difficult the world spirits market remains. GrandMet's loss
of the Absolut vodka brand shows the risk of acting as an agent for others.
There will be a perceptible impact on profits from 1995, just as GrandMet is
recovering from the dilutive effect of its Chef &amp; Brewer sale. But since
GrandMet owns all its other brands, there is no risk of a second hit and the
damage is containable.
The unexpected departure of Mr Crispin Davies, Guinness's top spirits man,
is harder to fathom. The most obvious explanation is that his background in
mass-market consumer goods is not ideally suited to building premium spirits
brands. That does not mean that his successor will have an easy task. And
Guinness, whose shares have fallen 14 per cent since the interim results, is
looking ruffled.

The German constitutional court decision on the Maastricht Treaty was at the
benign end of the spectrum as far as the markets were concerned. There is no
need for a referendum, and such conditions as the court did impose were not
onerous. So it seems surprising that the main beneficiary at the end of the
day should have been the D-Mark, rather than the other European currencies
which stand to gain from monetary union.
One reason may be that while the court has done nothing to impede European
currency union, its decision has not actually hastened it either. Economic
convergence remains some way off. The D-Mark will also retain a certain
safe-haven status as long as France clings to untenable interest rates.
Finally, the court decision has no immediate bearing on monetary policy.
Inflation and money supply growth are heading lower, but after yesterday's 6
per cent wage demand by the IG Metall engineering union, the Bundesbank
still has reason for caution over interest rate cuts.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The acknowledgment by British Coal's chairman, Mr Neil Clarke, that the pits
'reprieved' in March face closure comes as little surprise. While the
intention was for further coal contracts to be negotiated, the deafening
silence from the electricity generators has told its own tale. Gas-fired
plant is coming on stream quickly and the better performance of nuclear
power has left no need for further coal.
A few of these pits may be leased by entrepreneurs like Mr Malcolm Edwards
who think they can carve out a niche in the industrial and domestic market.
But attention is on the 'core' pits which will be put on the block next
year. There are plenty of practical problems to overcome - notably
allocating environmental liabilities and dividing up the remaining three
years of the coal contract among the pits. Yet the basic shape is becoming
clear. A large chunk of liabilities will have to be left with a residuary
body, and the final deals on the surviving pits may well be a hybrid of
outright sale and operating lease.
If the pits do not go to mining giants, the capital structure of the bidding
companies will need examination. Reliable cash flow in the first three years
means that any buy-out could afford to assume some debt. That, however,
would need to be paid down by 1998 when risks increase and contracts with
the generators will be smaller and harder to secure.

FT  13 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: UAP/Suez
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The deal between Union des Assurances de Paris and Suez is a fine example of
how previously irreconcilable parties can be brought together by force of
circumstance. The pair have been haggling over control of Colonia, Germany's
third largest insurer, for the best part of four years. But the looming
privatisation of UAP and deteriorating trading results at Suez have helped
concentrate minds. Selling UAP shares to international investors next year
will certainly be easier now a deal has been struck.
It is less clear that the transaction will add much spark to UAP's shares.
Exchanging its stake in French insurer Victoire with Suez for control of
Colonia makes strategic sense. Yet it is unlikely to transform the group's
prospects. Its shares have only just returned to the level of the 1990
rights issue which paid for the Victoire stake. By selling out now, UAP is
reducing its exposure to the cyclical upswing in French insurance markets.
Once privatisation is out of the way, UAP might look for growth elsewhere -
and possibly under new management should Mr Jean Peyrelevade, its chairman,
make the rumoured move to Credit Lyonnais. With a bridgehead established in
Germany, the UK looks the most obvious gap in its portfolio. The stake in
Sun Alliance built up during the summer through Transatlantic, the
investment company jointly owned with Mr Donald Gordon, could provide a
toehold. But to judge by its dogged approach to Colonia, UAP will be
prepared to wait.

Mr Rupert Murdoch's contrarian thinking has served his shareholders well.
But his ambitions to create a differential voting structure at News
Corporation go unhealthily against the grain of investor opinion. UK
companies, such as GUS and Whitbread, have recently felt compelled to
enfranchise non-voting shares. Continental European companies, too, are busy
simplifying voting structures. The Australian stock exchange would hardly
enhance its reputation by condoning the reverse.
The precise motivation for the plan is murky although there may well be a
defensive intent. With a market value near ADollars 20bn (Pounds 8.6bn),
News Corporation would appear impregnable. Yet, in bidding for Paramount,
both Viacom and QVC have shown that some relative minnows have ambitions far
above their stations. It seems more probable that Mr Murdoch simply does not
want his family's 32.7 per cent shareholding diluted further. This could
well have some bearing on as-yet-unknown succession plans. It could also
prove crucial if many new shares were issued as part of any strategic
alliance or grand expansion. With News's shares trading on a lofty rating,
the temptation to fund acquisitions with equity is overwhelming. After all,
News is painfully familiar with the perils of bank debt.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Banks face liability for pollution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has rejected calls by banks to be shielded from the potential
multimillion pound costs of cleaning industrial sites polluted by their
corporate customers.
Mr Tim Yeo, the environment minister, is to tell leading banks today that
the government believes they must bear some financial responsibility in
cases where they have lent money to companies which pollute the environment.
Mr Yeo will tell the British Bankers' Association that the government does
not accept that responsibility should fall solely on the polluting company,
or on public authorities in cases where the company cannot meet clean-up
costs.
He will say that banks are responsible along with polluters and landowners.
'They must live up to those responsibilities and not simply turn it all over
to the government to sort it out,' the text of Mr Yeo's speech says.
The speech follows lobbying by banks to be protected from liability for
clean-up costs in cases where they take possession of polluted land or where
they lend money to companies and so might be held to have an influence over
managements.
Banks have argued that they may limit lending to companies in some
industries if they face unlimited liability for environmental pollution.
They are worried some US legal standards may be adopted in Europe.
The European Commission has issued a green paper on remedying environmental
damage which considers a single legal framework for liability. The UK
government is also reviewing policy on contaminated land.
Banks have been particularly worried by the Fleet Factors case in the US
three years ago, in which a court held that banks must pay for pollution
damage if they had the capacity to influence the policy of a company.
Mr Yeo will say that the government does not favour the US framework, but
liability 'should follow responsibility - possibly even to bankers under
some circumstances'. Public funds should be used to clean up sites only
where there is no alternative.
Mr Derek Wanless, chief executive of National Westminster Bank and chairman
of the government's advisory committee on business and the environment, has
been among bankers calling for banks to be shielded.

FT  13 OCT 93 / A challenge to pole position: Britain's magnetic appeal to
overseas investors, once unparalleled in Europe, is under threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Farrar is a rarity in Redruth, Cornwall: 'I'm the only Yank
businessman down here. But the family has been made very welcome, even if we
don't speak proper English.'
As managing director of the European subsidiary of Contico International, a
Missouri-based manufacturing group, Mr Farrar is responsible for the
company's Pounds 4.3m investment in the Cornish town. His factory opened a
year ago to make a range of plastic household products for sale across
Europe; the plant is cramped and within two years the 71-strong workforce
should rise by more than half again.
Contico had considered other European locations. But in spite of worries
that British workers would reject a 24-hour-a-day production regime, the
comparative ease of setting up shop, generous grant aid and the English
language - notwithstanding any transatlantic variations - gave Redruth the
edge.
But if 36-year old Mr Farrar feels isolated he can take comfort from the
ranks of expatriate managers like him, supervising the colossal sums which
foreign investors have injected into the UK's industrial base during a
period of unprecedented inward investment activity.
News that Mercedes-Benz, traditionally a hallmark of German engineering
excellence, is actively considering Britain as the site for its planned
small car manufacturing plant has caused considerable excitement in
Whitehall.
But there is also concern in industry and government that Britain's best
days as a magnet for industrial investment may even now be over; foreign
investment, which has helped supplement the damaging domestic shortfall in
home-grown manufacturing capacity and technological skills, could
increasingly be directed elsewhere.
A study by the Centre for Economics and Business Research in London
underlines the importance of foreign direct investment. It concludes that
nearly one-fifth - more than Pounds 40bn - of the Pounds 220bn invested in
UK industry in the past five years has come from overseas. The percentage of
foreign-owned assets in the UK in relation to its total net assets - not
including oil and financial services - now approaches 20 per cent. Five
years ago, the figure just topped 13 per cent.
Of all non-EC companies with operations in the Community, nearly 40 per cent
of them have opted for the UK. Both the US and Japan, the biggest external
investors in European industry, have invested more in Britain than in any
other EC country.
Last year, according to the Department of Trade and Industry, overseas
companies initiated another 303 projects in Britain, aided by Pounds 100m of
regional grants. The electronics, automotive, food and service sectors have
proved the most active; the inventory of foreign investments so far involves
3,500 US, about 1,000 German and more than 200 Japanese manufacturing
businesses. Overseas-owned companies provide some 16 per cent of all UK
manufacturing jobs.
In spite of the political debate over whether Britain's success in winning
foreign investment is rooted in its alleged 'sweatshop economy' or in more
positive characteristics such as deregulation and low corporation taxes, the
UK appears to have left the European competition standing.
But are things set to change?. While global recession has inevitably cut
from its 1990 peak the level of inward investment, the fear is that other
pressures might permanently undermine Britain's success.
According to Mr Howard Davies, director general of the Confederation of
British Industry: 'The task of attracting inward investment on the scale we
have seen in the past five years will become increasingly difficult.' Mr
Davies' prediction seems safe, with some of the biggest investors refocusing
their overseas activities. The US, which makes one-third of all its European
investments in the UK, could be looking much closer to home.
'The US preference for the UK is changing,' says Mr Martin Gerra, president
of Global Affiliates, the Washington-based international business
consultancy, and a former manager of international economics at
International Business Machines.
He says that closer trade links between the US, Mexico and Canada, even
before ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement, will give
rise to a big increase in cross-border investment. 'Over time, US investment
in Europe, relative to total foreign investment, will inevitably decline.'
Japan, the second largest investor in the UK, remains keen to invest in a
country offering an EC foothold and which Japanese companies say has been
welcoming and supportive. But the rush of activity which has made Japanese
names commonplace on industrial estates in towns such as Telford could be
over.
'Japan had a lot of catching up to do, which led to their investment boom,'
according to Prof Douglas McWilliams, formerly chief economic adviser to the
CBI and founder of the Centre for Economics and Business Research.
'In 1981, only 4 per cent of its assets were overseas, against 30 per cent
for the US. But big Japanese companies have moved fast to raise the figure
to an average of 15 per cent and now the pace has slowed. The UK will remain
popular with them but investment is likely to decline over the next few
years.'
A study by accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand concludes the UK also risks losing
out on further, high-quality foreign investment. Mr Vince Taylor, one of the
authors, says: 'The UK could be squeezed during the remainder of the 1990s
between higher cost, but more centrally-located competitors within the EC,
and the emerging economies which can undercut our cost base and which now
appear able to match the UK in terms of quality.'
Though there is no evidence that inward investors are more likely to close
down plants than local owners, companies are also intensifying the search
for economies of scale as the European market becomes less fragmented. For
example, CPC (UK), a subsidiary of the US food group, recently announced a
switch in production of Knorr brand soups and stock cubes from Scotland to
France and Italy.
'Where you close down will be as important as where you open up,' emphasises
Mr David Rees, head of Ernst &amp; Young's European location service: 'There
could be good, strategic reasons for siting second and third investments
away from the first.' Britain's position, he emphasises, is not helped by
its continuing image as a less than wholehearted EC member, though
ratification of the Maastricht treaty might help allay such perceptions.
Dr Wilfried Vossen, managing director of Plant Location International, the
Brussels-based location consultancy, offers another view: 'If not signing
(Maastricht's) social chapter means Britain's cost structures continue to
provide a competitive edge over many of its European partners, then its
record on inward investment should be safe.'
Competition to attract inward investment looking for a home within Europe is
also escalating, with the number of investment promotion agencies working on
behalf of regional authorities and local councils multiplying. Coopers &amp;
Lybrand calculates agencies worldwide have doubled in five years.
Mr Christopher Priston, director of the Invest in Britain Bureau, an arm of
the DTI, claims it is 'still easier to put up a brass plate in the UK' than
in most EC countries. But some such as France - previously giving low
priority to attracting overseas investors - are working hard to make up lost
ground.
Mr Priston, whose bureau handles 4,000 inquiries annually on everything from
the incidence of earthquakes to membership of exclusive London clubs, warns
that Britain must 'continue to improve transport infrastructure to help
compensate for its location in Europe and also to raise skills training'.
Britain will also have to be demonstrably supportive to companies which have
already set up shop. According to Prof McWilliams of the Centre for
Economics and Business Research: 'You cannot underestimate the importance to
inward investors, particularly the Japanese, of feeling the government is
prepared to bat on their behalf.'
With some new investors into the UK privately complaining of being feted
before their arrival, only to be promptly abandoned afterwards, the IBB is
now contacting 1,000 established foreign companies to see if it can help
solve any problems they may have.
A decision by Mercedes-Benz to choose Britain would inevitably be greeted by
politicians as further proof of Britain's magnetic lure to world-class
manufacturing companies.
Potential new investors, however, will not like being trampled in the rush
by those anxious to win their favours. The mere prospect of Mercedes making
cars in Britain led initially to an unco-ordinated scramble by companies and
organisations to help secure the deal.
'Mercedes would be a real propaganda coup and we cannot afford to shoot
ourselves in the foot,' says a DTI minister. 'It would give a very timely
boost to an inward investment programme which we cannot allow to falter.'

FT  13 OCT 93 / Leading Article: An attack on the voluntary sector
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ORGANISATIONS IN Britain's voluntary sector now play an important part in
the delivery of a wide range of public services. In health, social services,
housing and education, charities compete with public bodies, quangos and
private companies to provide essential services. Some are now big players in
the internal markets which have been established throughout the public
services.
A report published yesterday by the Home Office suggests that providing
public services undermines charities' claims to a distinctive role in
society. It argues that those which take the government's shilling are no
longer voluntary organisations, and have surrendered their independence and
freedom to campaign. If they want to earn money by providing services, the
report concludes, they should lose their charitable status, together with
the tax reliefs that go with it.
Certainly the role of charities is changing in the new social market
economy. Yet charities which provide public services are arguably doing
nothing more than returning to the principles of their founders. Before the
arrival of the welfare state, many social services were provided by
voluntary bodies such as Barnardos and the Children's Society. Charities'
return to these tasks reflects a growing understanding that the welfare
state cannot satisfy all the demands of society.
Powerful lever
The big difference is that today's services are largely paid for by
taxpayers' money. Before the welfare state, it was charitable donations that
provided the income. Accepting public service contracts inevitably
constrains a charity's ability to criticise the paymaster openly. But it
offers the opportunity to influence government decisions from within. And
the threat to withdraw noisily from public service contracts because of
unacceptable policy decisions can be a powerful lever of persuasion.
The Home Office report suggests that campaigning work should be divorced
from service provision. This might be a sensible choice for charities which
find government contracts inhibiting their freedom to challenge the social
order. But to prescribe this divorce for all charities would be to sacrifice
an important link between campaigning activities and charities' ability to
provide services. It is often the campaigning of the charity which makes
people willing to work voluntarily or less expensively for it in the first
place.
Indeed, it is precisely their ability to mobilise volunteers and augment
taxpayers' money with charitable donations that makes charities such
valuable organisations. As life expectancy increases, there will be a
growing demand for the personal care services. Willingness to fund such
services through taxes is unlikely to rise commensurately. Expanding the
input of volunteers will be essential in meeting the demand.
Community's benefit
This is something which charities are well placed to organise. In an
increasingly wealthy society, paid work is often unnecessary for people who
have taken early retirement or left employment for family reasons.
Charitable organisations offer such people an opportunity to use their
skills for the community's benefit.
Volunteering also offers much to those who are involuntarily outside
employment. The government has run several schemes that encourage unemployed
people to become involved in community projects. Apart from the social
benefits, these schemes encourage their participants to maintain their work
skills and remain in contact with the world of work. So long as it is not
simply a question of displacing jobs from one employer to another, more
could be done to encourage voluntary work in return for benefits.
The Home Office report raises valid questions about the purpose of charities
and their role in society. But in proposing that charities receive rewards
for good contractual performance rather than by virtue of their charitable
status, it would risk turning charities into little more than government
agencies. The best charities are innovative, flexible and cost-effective.
The tax benefits of charitable status and the risk of the odd subsidised
broadside are an acceptable price to pay for such an asset.

The government has suffered an early setback in its well-flagged drive to
weed out unnecessary regulations. It has decided the Weeds Act 1959 is
indispensable. 'It is clear . . . that most people want to see it retained,'
the Ministry of Agriculture asserts.
As the majority of readers will no doubt be aware, the act empowers
ministers to take action against occupiers of land from the edges of which
common ragwort, spear thistle, creeping or field thistle, curled dock and
broad-leaved dock are spreading.

conference yesterday how the response to his whistle-stop international tour
has proved a success 'far beyond' his 'wildest expectations'.
But Mandela should perhaps not underestimate the difficulty of a country
coming in from the economic cold.
The October issue of CBI News includes a 12-page Market Report on South
Africa, followed directly by a regional survey of Northern Ireland.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Observer: Pike landed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last Thursday Francis Pike dropped in for a board meeting of Drayton Far
Eastern Trust, before heading to Chelsea register office to wed Lady Annabel
Goldsmith's daughter, India-Jane Birley. Pike's new boss, Philip Tose,
chairman of Hong Kong-based investment bank Peregrine Securities, flew in
for the day to be best man.
Without further ado, Pike left for Bombay, where he has 10 weeks before
opening the doors of a joint venture between Peregrine and Indian tobacco
company ITC.
Pike had spent the last 14 years at fund managers Invesco, 24 per cent of
which is now held by Peregrine. When management upheavals at Invesco a year
ago made his position uncomfortable, Pike, who has spent much of his time in
the Far East, took a call from his old friend Tose.
Having created Hong Kong's largest independent merchant banking group in
under five years, Tose's ambitions now stretch to repeating the success
story throughout Asia.
With the help of close associate Li Ka-Shing, lack of capital is not one of
Tose's problems. Peregrine last year sunk Dollars 30m into South Korea in
another joint venture, with commodities giant Dongbang.
ITC, meanwhile, rejected several British merchant banks in favour of the
Asian partner for its foray into financial services.
An adaptable sort, 39-year-old Pike spent his first three months in Tokyo
living in a Zen Buddhist temple before getting stuck into what he calls the
'gaijin ghetto'. But he is far from unworldly, as his blue Ferrari, fondly
remembered by Japanese friends, demonstrated.
In taking on the still formidable difficulties of the Indian market, he will
not be stuck for more ways to make his mark.

A City lawyer and bibliophile was browsing among the second-hand bookstalls
in Farringdon Road when a little tome, Oxford Essays on Jurisprudence,
caught his eye. Imagine his surprise when he opened the volume to find an
exchange of letters between Balliol College, Oxford and Robert Maxwell,
dated September 1965.
The then senior tutor, Donald Harris, first notes his satisfaction at the
completion of negotiations concerning the political fellowship the new
Labour MP was about to endow.
It continues: 'When you dined at Balliol you expressed an interest in the
enclosed volume, particularly the essays on Ownership and Possession.'
The new owner of the letter remarks on how the great man's memory of that
particular chapter must have dimmed a little when it came to the Maxwell
company pensions.

If this year's Nobel prize winners were to seek any tips from their
immediate predecessors, the advice would surely be to press for the lolly
quick.
Last year's laureates were spectacular victims of Europe's autumn currency
crisis. Their awards, each worth SKr6.5m, were announced in October, but had
shrunk by about 15 per cent in dollar terms by the time they were paid in
December, following the November flotation of the Swedish krona.
The latest recipients have been told that their prizes, worth SKr6.7m, will
again be paid in December. Now worth a third less against the greenback than
before the flotation, the krona is still tending to slither southwards.
At least yesterday's winners, Robert Fogel of Chicago University and
Douglass North of Washington University, should understand, for they are
both economic historians.
They are also upholding a tradition, for American economists have now swept
the board for four years running, with the University of Chicago featuring
each time.
Self-effacing panel chairman Assar Lindbeck, the Stockholm University
economist who earlier this year led a benchmark study on the precarious
state of the Swedish economy, even went on to admit that the American
dominance of the subject extended into new economic history.
The last non-American to win was Norwegian econometrist Trygve Haavelmo,
whose reaction to the announcement in 1989 was to mutter his disapproval of
prizes before disconnecting his telephone and retreating to his country
cottage. Contrast Fogel, who was called by Stockholm at 5 am Chicago time
with the news of his honour. Already in his office, he whipped up the
telephone on the first ring.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Karlsruhe's sound ruling
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
POSSIBLY THE most remarkable feature of the European Community's Maastricht
treaty is the profusion of contradictory opinions it inspires among both
backers and detractors. The plan at the centre of the treaty, for economic
and monetary union by the end of the century, was once vilified by a British
cabinet minister as 'a German racket designed to take over the whole of
Europe'. Yet the same plan is opposed by a majority of the German
electorate, according to opinion polls, on the opposing grounds that it
represents a ploy by Germany's EC partners to take over the D-Mark.
Yesterday's approval of the treaty by the Karlsruhe constitutional court
clears the way for Germany to become the final EC state to ratify
Maastricht. Since Germany is not only the EC's largest member, but also
possesses its hardest currency, any worthwhile form of Emu cannot take place
without its participation. The main uncertainty amid the many ambiguities of
the Maastricht process - whether Emu will take place at the end of the
1990s, or at all - has, as expected, not been resolved.
The court made clear that Emu's original 'irreversibility' - a notion to
which Chancellor Helmut Kohl himself at one stage gave some support - is no
longer credible. 'With ratification of the (European) union treaty, Germany
is not subordinating itself to an unclear and automatic mechanism towards
currency union which it cannot steer,' the court said yesterday. Since hopes
that Emu could take place according to the Maastricht timetable had already
been set back by recession and currency unrest, this ruling, however, was
little more than a juridical statement of the obvious.
Democratic principles
Considerably more important - and greatly to be welcomed - is the court's
clarification of the procedures under which Germany would transfer to
planned supranational institutions some elements of decision-making which at
present are held nationally. These procedures relate in particular to the
extension to the proposed European central bank of the monetary powers
wielded by the Bundesbank. Such a shift, the court ruled, could be made only
under conditions which conform to the democratic principles of the German
constitution, under which state power is held to emanate from the German
people.
The German parliament has already made clear during ratification that,
before the D-Mark could be subsumed into a single currency, it would closely
vet the conditions. This examination, it now appears, will relate not simply
to the ability of Emu applicants to meet the Maastricht economic performance
criteria, laying down which states should make the first move towards a
single currency. More widely, parliament will be under the obligation to
ensure that European integration meets standards of legislative transparency
and accountability which the German people legitimately require to be
upheld.
Focus of discord
How these safeguards will be maintained remains unclear. The proposed
participation in European law-making of the Bundesrat, which represents the
interest of the German Lander, could become a focus of discord with
Germany's EC partners.
Mr Kohl has long urged increased powers for the European parliament as part
of his original demand - rejected at the 1991 Maastricht summit - for
monetary union to take place in step with the much more vague concept of
political union. Although yesterday's ruling rejected any formal linkage
between monetary and political union, the issue of giving the Strasbourg
parliament more muscle will remain firmly on the German government's agenda.
The main message from Karlsruhe is that the process of European integration
will suffer further setbacks unless it retains the consent and consensus of
European electorates. The unpopularity of the Maastricht treaty displayed in
opinion polls and referendums around the continent during the last 18 months
illustrates how this consensus has been in short supply. By reminding the
Community of the need for democratic and constitutional checks along the
route to European union, the Karlsruhe court has not made the path any
easier. But it has given politicians strong and wise guidance on how
eventually to reach the destination.

   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The daily 'chokai' sessions for the 500 blue-jacketed employees at the
Scottish manufacturing plant of OKI, the Japanese electronics company, have
been upbeat affairs in recent months, writes Michael Cassell.
The morning meetings, intended to enable everyone to participate in running
the company, take place against a background of growing order books and
higher production.
OKI arrived in Cumbernauld in 1987 after a long search to find a European
operating centre for its manufacturing, sales and research and development.
The company, founded more than 100 years ago, had looked hard at Spain,
France and Germany, according to Mr David Ennis, director of personnel and
corporate affairs.
It chose Cumbernauld mainly because of the availability of skilled workers,
good infrastructure and communications, as well as modest regional grant
aid, which was helpful but not critical in reaching the decision. 'The golf
courses might have helped a bit as well,' Mr Ennis concedes.
An initial investment of Pounds 20m - spent refurbishing a 500,000 sq ft
factory, one of Scotland's biggest - has grown to Pounds 32m with a decision
to install specialist plant to make electronic components for Honda's new
Swindon car plant.
From Cumbernauld, OKI supplies its entire European customer base with an
expanding range of products.
This customer base is now expanding following a decision to use Cumbernauld
to service the US with some products. Rising Japanese manufacturing costs
have prompted the company to switch to Cumbernauld the production of some
dot matrix printers for export to the US. About 100,000 printers a year will
be made and shipped from Scotland, instead of Japan, helping to safeguard
local jobs and boost exports.
It is a similar story at Yamazaki Machinery UK, the Worcester-based
machine-tool manufacturing subsidiary of Japan's Yamazaki Mazak. Last year,
it won a Queen's award for its overseas sales efforts.
Yamazaki's UK operation has invested Pounds 40m at Worcester since arriving
six years ago, making it Britain's biggest machine-tool maker. It sees
itself as a European business serving mainly European markets: 85-90 per
cent of output is sold outside the UK.
The company employs 270 people and calculates that it indirectly supports a
similar number of jobs among local suppliers. It was attracted to the
cathedral town by availability of labour, a mature supply base and the
English language. It also received help worth more than Pounds 5m from the
DTI, then available to companies implementing flexible manufacturing
systems.
Yamazaki had no initial complaints about quality of materials, but
unreliable deliveries were a problem. Now, partly thanks to Yamazaki
publicising the plant suppliers' performances, 93 per cent of parts are
supplied on time.
Mr John Maund, deputy managing director, says efficiency levels are high and
pay is in the 'medium rank' for manufacturing.
Yamazaki stages an annual bonfire party on vacant land it owns alongside its
Worcester plant. But the venue may eventually have to change: Mr Maund does
not doubt future investment will fill the site.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Blasts from the past: Mr Papandreou has to take tough action
to improve Greece's economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A glow of nostalgia for Greek voters helped propel Mr Andreas Papandreou,
leader of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement, back to power in this week's
general election. Now he has to find a way of matching the increase in
living standards that Greeks enjoyed when he was prime minister between 1981
and 1989.
After running an election campaign in which he pledged to fight for full
employment, lower inflation and a lasting 'social contract' between
employees and companies on wage levels, Mr Papandreou has to square his
ambitions with Greece's deteriorating economic circumstances  - particularly
its escalating debt.
Efforts by the outgoing conservative New Democracy party to implement
far-reaching structural reforms - including the ending of price
restrictions, liberalisation of labour laws and strengthening of competition
policy - deepened Greece's recession in the short term. The official GDP
growth forecast for this year remains 1 per cent. What buoyancy there is can
be found in the black economy, which, by some estimates, accounts for 40 per
cent of national income.
Voters appear to have held Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, former Conservative
prime minister, responsible for this state of affairs. His approval rating
in the campaign never exceeded 25 per cent.
The origins of Greece's current problems, however, lie mainly in Mr
Papandreou's last term in office. The effects were hidden as Greece
benefited from large grants from the European Community, worth about Dollars
2bn a year through most of the 1980s. But, while such inflows helped the
agricultural sector and boosted consumer spending, confidence among
investors in Greek industry fell off sharply.
A principal cause was Mr Papandreou's decision in 1983 to nationalise
Heracles General Cement, Europe's largest cement exporter, and one of
Greece's biggest private-sector companies. The move appeared to lack
rational explanation and was seen by many as a sop to the radicals in his
socialist party. The result was to alarm investors.
Direct investment from overseas in Greek manufacturing and service
industries totalled no more than Dollars 2bn in the 1980s, against Dollars
6.5bn in similar-sized Portugal, according to OECD estimates. Although
membership of the EC from 1981 offered opportunities for increasing trade,
Greek manufacturing shrank during the decade, competitiveness fell and
exports grew only modestly.
The travails of manufacturers, however, did not dissuade the socialist
government from extending the welfare state, by raising pensions and
indexing public sector wages to inflation. In addition, the number of public
servants increased in the 1980s by more than 40,000, or about 10 per cent.
With spending exceeding economic growth, Greece's public sector borrowing
requirement jumped from 5 per cent of GDP in 1980 to about 20 per cent in
1990.
The consequences of his last term of office will fill Mr Papandreou's
in-tray as he returns to government this week. The New Democracy party tried
to increase tax revenues and to cut civil service numbers, but made little
headway. The pressures on Mr Papandreou for such reforms are just as
compelling - particularly if Greece is to come close to fulfilling the
economic convergence criteria of the Maastricht treaty. Progress on this
front could also determine Greece's eligibility for future EC structural
assistance.
Though Mr Papandreou is an economist, the signs are he may not give the
economy his full attention. His health is poor; a heart condition restricts
his working hours. Mr Papandreou prefers foreign policy. He has also to hold
together a party that is given to disputes between radical and moderate
wings.
His ability to indulge different factions is limited, however, as his party,
Pasok, has endorsed the Maastricht treaty's ambition of European economic
and monetary union, although its timescale for Greece to meet EC targets is
longer than its Conservative predecessor's.
The Conservative government managed to reduce the inflation rate from 20.4
per cent in 1990 to 12.8 per cent last month. By Draconian curbs on public
spending - including threats to sack chief executives of state corporations
who awarded wage increases above a pre-set level - it also cut general
government borrowing to 13.4 per cent of GDP last year.
But these achievements still leave Greece a long way off Maastricht targets.
Accumulated debt, currently equal to about 120 per cent of GDP, is double
the 60 per cent envisaged under convergence criteria. Debt raised on
domestic financial markets has increased particularly rapidly to fund
government spending. Interest payments on this debt will rise next year by
almost 30 per cent to Dr3,000bn (Dollars 12.5bn), equivalent to 16 per cent
of GDP. That means the government will have to raise an extra Dr300bn every
month from sales of treasury bills.
'Greece has a huge amount of debt, more than many Latin American countries
in the 1980s. It was able to go on borrowing because of being an EC member,'
says Ms Miranda Xafa, economic adviser to Mr Mitsotakis.
Additional pressure on Mr Papandreou comes from an expected shortfall in tax
revenue this year of about Dr800bn, caused by the recession and
over-optimistic forecasts in last December's budget. Moreover, he is
committed to cancelling Greece's privatisation programme, so ruling out
about Dr330bn in privatisation receipts this year.
One alternative for Mr Papandreou would be to reduce debt charges by cutting
interest rates, now at about 20 per cent on a one-year Treasury bill. But
the risk would be large-scale outflows of capital as investors sought higher
returns elsewhere.
The socialist government may feel obliged to take radical steps that
previous governments have shied away from: making big cuts in public
spending, eliminating civil service jobs, and curbing tax evasion in the
black economy.
In the heady days following his election victory, Mr Papandreou has not
given any details of his economic policy. The precedents only underline the
difficulties before him. The Conservative government tried to boost
efficiency at tax offices. But the finance ministry believes attempts to
make life more difficult for tax evaders have been inhibited by corruption
among tax officials.
Trimming the public sector payroll proved virtually impossible, despite the
Conservatives' promises to the EC that 60,000 jobs would be cut between 1991
and 1993. Mr Mitsotakis says that, over the period, one person was hired for
every three who retired from the civil service. But his claims are not
supported by the government's economic advisers and it is far from clear
whether the 60,000 target is even close to being achieved.
Yet the rewards for returning Greece's economy back towards steady growth,
with public spending under control, would be substantial. The EC is set to
provide up to Ecu20bn for infrastructure projects over the next six years.
If competitiveness can be improved, there is also scope for increasing
earnings from overseas and trade; the conflict in former Yugoslavia has not
blocked Greek access to markets elsewhere in the Balkans and in southern
Russia and Ukraine.
But though there is no formal link, political decisions on allocating EC
funds may be affected by perceptions among member states about whether
Greece is committed to economic reform. Mr Papandreou may also find it more
difficult to convince investors that good times lie ahead than the voters
who elected him on Sunday.

<TEXT>
Sir, As a future first-time buyer I noted with great interest the article on
the long-term view of the housing market ('The long view' October 9). I
agree that a home is not a prime money-making asset in today's climate but I
do not agree that there will necessarily be a shortage of first-time buyers
in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
The reason that I will buy into the housing market in a few years' time is
because I feel that owning a house will give me far greater security in
later life than renting a house. With this in mind I feel that the market
for first-time buyers will continue to prosper under a much 'wiser'
generation.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Singapore privatisation share offers
no different from those in UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ABDUL AZIZ MAHMOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Contrary to your report, 'Singapore goes all out to turn its citizens
into share owners' (October 5), the Singapore government is not 'urging the
public to go on a share-buying spree'. It is encouraging Singaporeans to own
shares as long-term investments and take a direct stake in Singapore's
prosperity and success.
Nor is the government granting 'considerable incentives to those who put
their money into the stock market'. It is specifically offering a limited
number of Singapore Telecom (ST) shares to each citizen at a 45 per cent
discount when the company is privatised. This is no different from what the
British government did when privatising companies like British Telecom and
British Petroleum.
You said that 'Singaporeans have been bombarded by state-sponsored
television and newspaper advertisements describing the virtues of share
ownership'. The public education programme accompanying the ST flotation is
smaller, in proportion to the size of the issue, than similar programmes in
overseas privatisations, for example British Telecom.
You pointed out correctly that there is no guarantee ST will thrive after it
is listed. This depends on the quality of its management and its ability to
exploit rapid economic, technological, and regulatory changes in the
telecommunications industry.
But the government is not forcing anyone to buy ST shares. The investing
public, within and outside Singapore, will assess ST's prospects and decide
what its shares are worth.
Why should Singaporeans blame the government for offering them a discount
off the fair market price of these shares?

FT  13 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Snags in cutting red tape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J D RIMINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In so far as your leader, 'Cutting red tape' (October 11), refers to
industrial health and safety legislation, you misconceive the problem.
The 'radical idea' of government setting out general regulatory objectives
instead of detail has governed our whole approach for 20 years, but now
needs applying in other regulatory areas, together with more risk assessment
and a cost-based approach - of which we are also the main regulatory pioneer
in the UK.
But there are three snags. First, much new EC-based legislation has been
unnecessarily prescriptive despite our best efforts in negotiation. Second,
industry demands guidance from the regulator, both on good practice and on
what general provisions mean. Such guidance obviously includes detail, which
is often given unduly prescriptive weight in civil litigation, or paraded as
'law' by safety contractors or less reputable safety consultants. Finally,
many small businesses express a clear wish for detailed as opposed to
general guidance.
All of these issues are being addressed in the Health and Safety
Commission's current fundamental review of health and safety regulations.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Advertisers oppose ITV concentration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KENNETH MILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Louis Sherwood, chairman of HTV (Letters, October 6), brought out some
key points which undermine the lobbying by certain ITV companies to get
changes in the takeover rules. He pointed out that there is now a clear
majority of ITV companies rejecting ownership rule changes.
What is surely equally important is that a large majority of advertisers -
the companies which fund ITV - oppose changes in the ownership rules. The
reason is clear: advertisers know that viewers will continue to be more
loyal to ITV if they have confidence in the regional company serving them -
not a large conglomerate with no real local identity. Also, advertisers do
not want to see new cartels and monopolies develop within the ITV system
when we have only just got rid of the old monopoly structure, which did so
much harm. I hope very much that ITV will take note of the views of their
customers.
If there are economies to be made - and we are extremely doubtful about the
imaginary Pounds 100m savings - then it is the duty of the ITV companies to
remove this cost now, and invest the sums saved in programmes or in better
dividends to shareholders. But these savings are probably a myth since we
all know 'big is beautiful' is a doubtful argument.
Let us remember, if we want to see competition and choice in ITV, as in
broadcasting generally, it would be foolish to allow ITV to merge into a
small number of groups, dominated by a few large ITV companies.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Work harder is only option in US and
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr FRANK C WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Thank you for providing excellent information on business in Europe.
Problems of unemployment and potential growth are clearly very challenging.
I have just finished an assignment in a textile operation in Europe. Some
key data are:
Total wage costs per hour: (Europe) Dollars 21.25, (US) Dollars 10.25,
(Mexico) Dollars 2.
Benefits as percentage of total wage: 44, 22, 40.
Percentage absent from job: 10-20, 2-4, 1-3.
Approximate employee hours worked per year: 1,490, 1,860, 1,940.
Plant operating hours per year: 5,150, 8,400, 6,000.
North American and European personnel at all levels are going to have to go
back to work - fewer holidays, and benefits with more flexibility. There are
not enough technology jobs with high pay to provide employment for everyone
who wants such a job.
New plant, property and equipment is so expensive that plants must have the
capability of operating 168 hours per week for 52 weeks per year with little
overtime. No business can forecast customer demand with sufficient accuracy,
so personnel and other resources must be shifted about for best operations.
High-cost nations, including the US, must change. Otherwise, growth and
employment will be shifted to low-cost countries.

FT  13 OCT 93 / A fool's wise words: Mitterrand and Havel have taken
different roles on the European stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was more than a whiff of history about last weekend's summit of the
Council of Europe in Vienna. Parallels were drawn between the 'concert of
Europe' established at the 1815 Congress of Vienna to keep the
post-Napoleonic peace, and this Council of Europe whose 32 members were
meeting to try to define a post-cold war European order.
At least, that's what the more visionary among them thought they should be
doing. Others may have had a more limited view of what it was all about. The
council can hardly claim to be one of the main centres of power in today's
world, or even today's Europe. It does not deal with military or economic
matters, and neither the US nor Russia is a member (though Russia has
applied to join). Their representatives were cleared from the room, along
with other riff-raff such as the presidents of Albania and Croatia, not to
mention myself, after the opening speeches and before the 'working session'
began.
Officially, the summit had serious work to do. It had to streamline the
control machinery of the European Convention on Human Rights, and to agree
on ways of protecting national minorities. In reality all that had been done
before it started, in months of negotiation among officials. The summit
itself was a series of set-piece speeches, most of which were distributed to
the press.
Two speeches made a particular impression on those who were privileged to
hear them - both made by presidents who have been central figures on the
European stage but no longer enjoy the reality of power in their own
countries. The summit, an occasion for sounding alarms and setting
guidelines rather than detailed horsetrading, might have been tailor-made
for them.
Indeed, it was tailor-made by one of them, for the summit had been Francois
Mitterrand's idea. The French president's speech - 35 minutes without a text
 -seemed to some of those who heard it like the final homily of a patriarch
to his wayward children. As paraphrased by the well-briefed reporters of Le
Monde, the French president 'described the tormented, incomplete landscape
of the greater Europe - with fragmentation, dislocation, war on one side,
and on the other a multiplicity of institutions with only a partial
vocation, none of them capable of giving structure to the whole'.
The EC, he pointed out, has a very high entrance fee, and 'cannot, in the
foreseeable future, open its doors to all'. As for the Conference on
Security and Co-operation in Europe, it is 'everyone and no one', said Mr
Mitterrand. 'Who has ever seen their security protected by it?' Apparently
he did not mention Nato, but he hardly needed to. Delegates had only to
return to their hotel rooms and switch on CNN, to see President Bill Clinton
struggling to extricate the US from Somalia while reporters quoted White
House officials as saying the chances of the US committing troops to keep
the peace in Bosnia were now greatly reduced.
So, in Mr Mitterrand's view, there is a need for some new structure to fill
the vacuum. Could not the Council of Europe become its 'embryo'?
Mr Vaclav Havel spoke next. His speech had been translated, printed and
distributed hours before, but it was a devastating riposte - not only to Mr
Mitterrand but to all the west European leaders present. He denounced 'the
erroneous belief that the great European task before us is a purely
technical, a purely administrative, or a purely systemic matter, and that
all we need to do, therefore, is come up with ingenious structures, new
institutions and new legal norms and regulations . . . without the
negotiating partners ever attempting to change anything in themselves and in
the habitual motives and stereotypes of their behaviour.
'Twice in the 20th century,' the Czech president went on, 'the whole of
Europe has paid a tragic price for the narrow-mindedness and lack of
imagination of its democracies' - first when they retreated before Nazism
and second when they 'allowed Stalin to swallow up one half of our
continent'. And now, he warned, 'I am afraid a third such failure is
threatening us. I am not only thinking of the caution and indecision that
mark the attitudes of the developed part of western Europe towards the
post-communist countries. I am thinking as well, and above all, of how they
have behaved so far in relation to what is going on in Bosnia and
Hercegovina, and in the whole of the former Yugoslavia . . .
'If various western states cannot rid themselves of their subconscious drive
for a dominant position in their own sphere of interests, if they don't rid
themselves of their self-centred protectionism and stop trying to outwit
history by reducing the idea of Europe to a noble backdrop against which
they continue to defend their own petty interests, and if the post-communist
states do not make radical efforts to come to terms with the ghosts their
newly won freedom has turned loose, then . . . '
Then what? A presidential speechwriter must have intervened, for Mr Havel
concluded rather weakly: 'then Europe will only with great difficulty be
able to respond to the challenge of the present and fulfil the opportunities
that lie before it'. I would bet you anything his first draft said 'we shall
all go to hell', or words to that effect.
Mr Havel, of course, is a playwright, not a politician. And the part he has
written himself, in the latest act of Europe's long-running tragedy, is that
of the fool. One diplomat compared his Vienna speech to 'farting in church'.
But in Shakespeare, and perhaps in other playwrights too, the fool often
proves the wisest member of the cast.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Arts: Keyboard Skills - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bush Theatre has many virtues but is not normally a load of fun. This
week it has thrown-off its sackcloth and ashes and gone up-market with a
sprightly comedy about junior ministers in the Conservative Party. Moreover,
Keyboard Skills does not even sneer at the Tories in their misfortunes. At
times, it is a bit of a sentimental weepie.
The keyboard skills are not those of the piano. They belong to the
typing-room. There used to be a woman, played here by Marcia Warren, who
trained young girls to become secretaries, indispensable to their boss and
perhaps one day becoming his wife. Trouble almost invariably followed, of
the kind you read about in the newspapers every other day.
True, much the same thing happens in the Labour Party but, without saying so
directly, Keyboard Skills is unmistakeably about the modern Tories. Watch
(it would be hard not to) the immaculate performance by Deborah Findley as
the girl in question. She is well-dressed, well-coiffured, relatively
efficient, patient, forgiving and totally well-meaning. Only when it comes
to the mind, which it does not very often, is there something lacking: it is
not her fault that she has not been properly educated. She wants her man and
will protect him. But the man, through a mixture of vanity and ambition,
lets her down. Even then she may stick by him.
After so many real-life stories, there is a danger of parody. Keyboard
Skills, written by Lesley Bruce, who learned her own skills while working at
the BBC, avoids the pitfalls. As the wife of the junior minister, Ms Findley
is an altogether stronger and more interesting character than her husband.
Yet Jonathan Coy, as the minister, is not entirely caricature in the way of
(say) Spitting Image. He wants a Cabinet job in the next 18 months, then one
that really matters before the general election, and who knows what might
happen after that? He might even become - he does not say the next two
words, but we know what he means. This is quite close to the bone.
Of course, he gets into trouble. Do not expect a David Mellor story. The
plot is much cleverer than that. Do not expect an attack on the media
either. The newspapers are simply a power in the background. They never
pounce and indeed never appear. The minister leaves his bag unattended in a
pub in Bromley, rather as the late Richard Crossman (how the social nuances
change) once left his papers behind in Pruniers in St James's Street. It is
the minister's bag that is taken by the police for an IRA device, though it
turns out that there is a real one as well.
There are some lovely twists. If the junior minister seems less than a Tory
patrician, he is nothing like such a creep as the young Tories coming up.
Early in the play, with a set cunningly designed by Robin Don, we have a
peep into the minister's wardrobe. It contains several dinner jackets and
about 10 suits in varying shades of grey. The younger MP, aspiring to become
a junior minister and whose surname is Compton-Miller, wears a bright blue
cummerbund and tie to match.
Wardrobe matters. Almost the best scene in the play comes when Ms Findley
opens her own. It is very extensive: from Gucci to the Scotch House,
everything that the wife of an ambitious Tory MP could need - 'stylish
without being showy', 'sexy without being tarty'. The descriptions go on as,
one by one, she throws her costumes to the floor. An impressive array of
shoes remains unflung.
This is a much better political play than David Hare's The Absences of War
at the National Theatre: livelier, more contemporary and avoiding
moralising. If it has a message, it is Tory feminism. The piece is directed
without a single fault by Geraldine McEwan. Yet one should be wary of
talking about transfers. The production is designed for the small stage,
which is probably where it should stay.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Arts: Modern Czech music goes 'underground' - Music in
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A celebration of Czech music such as the London South Bank has mounted - the
three-week-long 'Czech Festival', now halfway through its course - is bound
to follow a well-marked route-map. Dvorak, Smetana, Janacek, Martinu, Suk:
these are the obvious attractions of the Czech musical landscape, and there
is no sense in not paying all of them properly dutiful attention.
But, all to their credit, the series organisers have attempted to round out
the experience by dotting in a few less frequently-visited stopping-points
on the schedule. The programme of operas associated with the Terezin
concentration camp (on which John Allison reported last Saturday) was one
such. Another was the Monday-evening recital by Agon, the Prague-based
new-music ensemble, only 10 years old and paying its first visit to Britain.
This was a snatch of Czech cultural history in demonstration. From the
start, Agon's declared 'underground' outlook and taste for the gamut of
postwar Western modern-music styles and pursuits were evidently much frowned
on, turning the composers who wrote for the group into a sort of Prague
musical 'salon des refuses'. Even now that political changes have led to the
dismantling of the country's state-dominated musical machinery, it remains
(one gathers) obstinately outside the Prague musical scene.
Monday's programme, a showcase of some of the wildly varied musical manners
Agon has been investigating, explained why. Indeed, the concert provided a
good deal more illumination into Czech cultural politics in the dying years
and then aftermath of Communism than actual listening pleasure. Whether by
intention or design, the outlook seemed to be as much purgative as
exploratory: with the exception of the opening work, Jan Rychlk's African
Cycle (1961), a rather delightful short outburst of naive-primitivist
energy, everything that followed was designed to Stretch Horizons with a
vengeance - and with a problem for the listener for whom these particular
horizons may have been stretched to breaking point.
In Zbynek Vostrak's Secret Fishing (1973), this involved Stockhausen-ish
doodlings for four separate instrumental groups. In Rudolf Komorous's York
(1967), it meant post-Dadaist whimsy. Peter Graham's Get out of whatever
cage you are in (1992) was a noisy happening on (as the title suggested)
John Cage-style chance-principles. Martin Smolka's Rain, Roofs (1993)
slammed out a series of chords which were then allowed to disintegrate, at
wearisome length.
The cacophony of The Fire is Mine (1993) by Petr Kofron, Agon's conductor,
eventually drove me out of the hall: the point of this anarchic exercise in
noise-for-noise-sake was plain enough - but it was clearly intended for an
audience entirely different from Monday's venturesome Purcell Room handful.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Arts: Mellowed up for kicks - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week's viewing taught me another use of the word 'mellow'. On Teenage
Kicks (BBC2, 8.00), young teenagers explained that 'mellowing up' is one of
the agreeable states of mind they achieve from doing drugs. 'Mellowing up'
also perfectly captures the goal sought by millions of adults at least once
a day as that first icy campari or warm claret courses down their gullets.
The much-publicised statistic was that 50 per cent of teenagers have
experimented with an illicit drug. It came from an unpublished Manchester
University survey of 750 teenagers in the north-west of England,
starting-point for the documentary. But is this figure really so alarming?
As a pleasant-sounding young lass of around 15 told the interviewer,
'Everyone's tried everything'. Her ambition was to go into the police force.
What is youth if not the time to experiment? Clearly, more youngsters today
do drugs than in my generation, and unlike us they have access to a
veritable cocktail-cabinet of the stuff at very cheap prices; Pounds 2.50
for a tab of LSD, cannabis for two nights for Pounds 1 a head. What one
really needs to assess is how serious are the possible consequences.
Kids interviewed on the programme were adamant that they would not be
graduating to 'dirty', addictive drugs. They take pleasure from feeling that
they are in control of potentially hazardous substances which they pick and
mix with a sophistication not so far removed from a wine-connoisseur
planning what will be served at dinner.
One of the film's themes was that drugs have always elicited a hysterical
response from the older generation. These days, politicians find the demonic
image of the drugs is particularly welcome since it is more convenient to
blame rising crime on drugs than to fend off the suggestion that high youth
unemployment is the key factor in increased burglaries and muggings.
If it is true that 50 per cent of young people take drugs 'as casually as
their parents drink or smoke', does it matter? Reading this column will be
bankers, publishers, doctors, and barristers, people who themselves were
once teenage drug-takers. It is interesting to reflect how different things
might have been if they had they been caught.
Nowadays, the police let off many people caught with drugs; in 1991, 50 per
cent of drug offences were dealt with by cautions. One of the many
unsatisfactory aspects of the current situation is that it gives the police
too much leeway to discriminate over which kid with cannabis they prosecute
 -Wykehamist or Walthamstow black.
The only reference to class background and drugs was an academic's vague
observation that 'people from middle-class homes turn up in the statistics'.
The real risk to teenagers' health was another topic skirted round rather
than addressed. We heard that 'every weekend' sees drug tragedies at a
Manchester hospital; how many are teenagers and what have they taken?
Similarly, how real a risk is dehydration for the frenzied dancers at
all-night parties, swallowing 'uppers' and Ecstasy at Pounds 15 a go?
Even so, this was a strong programme which will surely have nudged some
viewers nearer the notion that government needs to engage with the question
of liberaling drugs. As another good documentary, BBC 2's Assignment: The
War on Drugs recently showed, it is an opinion increasingly common in Europe
and the US, and argued by some policemen here. At the very least, Teenage
Kicks showed that for adults to base their views about drugs on complacency,
double-think and ignorance is no use as a response to teenagers' natural
desire to mellow up of an evening.
For a lesson in how not to edit a documentary you needed to watch two
documentaries on Thursday; the week's instalment of The Dog's Tale (BBC2,
Thursday) and C4's Critical Eye: Proud Arabs and Texas Oilmen. Both
programmes were quite extraordinarily disjointed, leaping from subject to
subject and, in the case of the latter, chucking images together in an
infuriating way. This was a pity because both had interesting material.
The Dog's Tale investigated the spiritual significance of the dog across
cultures. A Siberian tribe merited only a brief appearance because of their
interesting but unphotogenic custom of sacrificing huskies. The Dalai Lama
was interviewed in a humorous mood, wondering whether because one of his
dogs has no sex drive it suggested that it was a reincarnated monk.
The programme continually veered between two fascinating films, one of which
was the opposing attitudes to the dog held by Zoroastrians and Moslems in
Bombay and the other dog-fighting in Japan. One moment we were watching a
Zoroastrian boy being ritually washed in bull's urine. The next we were with
Nobaharu Hamono, godfather to a clan of Yakuza, Mafia-style mobsters,
watching Tosa dogs fighting in a forest near Tokyo.
Tosa dogs were an unexpected result of contact between western missionaries
and the Japanese in the last century. In the second world war, Tosa fights
entertained troops at the front line. Now Tosas amuse Yakuza bosses, who
will spend as much as Pounds 1 million each on holding a tournament. Rules
are strict and dogs lose if they make as if to copulate - another clue,
perhaps, to the past life of the Dalai Lama's dog?
'The last people to deal properly with proud Arabs are Texan oilmen like
Bush and Baker, impatient men', ruminated Lord Healey in the C4 documentary
about the Gulf War and the effect on Iraq of sanctions. Lord Healey cast
doubt on the US official figure of the casualties as being between 75,000
and 120,000, quoting instead a figure of 75,000 just for civilian
casualties. Lady Olga Maitland stoutly maintained that the war was 'a job
well done'.
The film's thesis was that the US bullied, bribed, and ignored the UN, and
that there was no moral justification for the war. Oddly, it overlooked the
claim for Iraq's nuclear capability and it also left Israel quite out of the
picture. However, its principal weakness was in a bombardment of images
which were often dubiously relevant and hackneyed to boot. The narrator had
an exceedingly boring voice.
From almost the first line spoken in Mark Lawson's play, The Vision Thing
(BBC 2, 925), I thought we were in for a bad do. As the Tory prime minister
(competently acted by Richard Wilson) walked to the podium to address the
party conference, his party chairman (hammed up by Derek Jacobi) muttered:
'Let's hope he gets their clitoris.' And Lawson thinks that is funny?
It might sound like an obvious recipe for success; Lawson, a journalist,
writes a satirical play about politics. Think of Swift, one of the greatest
satirists in English literature, who laboured for years as a parliamentary
sketch writer. Aha, but Tale of A Tub or Gulliver's Travels were fantastical
and wildly inventive. Lawson's play was simply a rehash of all the Tory
party's scandals and mishaps of recent years, material well and truly done
to death by every comedian and punning headline-writer.
After a brief flash of passable invention - the PM hearing the voice of God
 -the play reversed into a sputtering imitation of the bonfire of the
vanities. Its structure was incoherent. Press secretary Mark Fisher
(Nathaniel Parker) starts out as narrator of the God-plot, but then becomes
just another character in the second story of how as a young foreign
secretary he is brought down by newspaper revelations of his extra-marital
affair. Jokes about relations between the Tories and the Press had a deadly
knowingness.
Next time Mr Lawson writes a play, the vehicle for his satire should
preferably be something he knows nothing about. Might I suggest Tosa
fighting?

FT  13 OCT 93 / Arts: A cool Russophile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pianist Nicholas Walker - early mid-30s, one might guess, and just
starting to acquire a reputation - made his Wigmore Hall debut on Monday,
with a boldly obscure but fervently Slav-oriented programme. The only
non-Slavic composers, Beethoven and Liszt, were represented by inspirations
from eastward: a polonaise and variations on a Russian dance from the one,
arrangements of Russian songs from the other.
But my real reason for going was that Walker is engaged in recording (for
ASV) the complete piano oeuvre of Balakirev, including three pieces in this
recital. Nobody else has 'done' Balakirev yet. My conviction is that among
piano-composers Balakirev was a great minor master; and that a rediscovery
of him, long overdue, should give unexpected pleasure to a lot of
music-lovers. So, as a closet Balakirevite I have a keen interest in how his
piano music may fare now. He wrote just as many - more than 40 - fine,
undiscovered songs as well, but we shall have to wait; some of them require
brilliant pianists too.
It was Balakirev who established the 'Great Five', or 'Mighty Handful' of
Russian nationalist composers: himself, Mussorgsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, Borodin
and the now-forgotten Cui. None of them had any formal Western training, but
Balakirev had been a practical musician from his earliest years, long before
Glinka made him his protege in St. Petersburg. His only piano teacher was a
pupil of John Field (who invented the 'nocturne' before Chopin), and he
learned the mid-19th century piano repertoire thoroughly - Hummel, Field,
Schumann, Chopin, Liszt. From that, he developed his own fastidious,
sparkling piano idiom, which demands strict digital clarity, a wide stretch
and plenty of elan.
Walker proved to be the nearest thing to a natural Balakirev performer that
I have heard in a long while. When Western pianists go Slavophile, it is
nearly always through seduction by Skryabin (Chopin carried to visionary
extremes), Rakhmaninov (restless passion, sumptuous noise) or Prokofiev's
grittily athletic sonatas. Except for the lusty Islamey, his only well-known
piece, Balakirev was a world and almost a generation away from that.
Walker's own programme-note called him 'a Russian cocktail of Chopin, Liszt
and the Orient', but more could be said: his music is tidily intricate,
poised and lucid, with an exotic scent but scarcely a superfluous note.
Too often modern virtuosi deliver Islamey with heedless vulgarity, at grave
cost to its best musical effects. Walker's heart and fingers were in very
much the right place for Balakirev - roughly a century ago, with all the
apposite period-finesse. Candid passion is not his forte: shorn of that,
Rakhmaninov's op. 33 Etudes-Tableaux sounded like bleak, fascinating,
experiments in the surreal. His Liszt and early Chopin were elegantly
calculated, where a dose of extrovert charm would have been a useful bonus.
In Walker's scrupulous Balakirev, however - the sixth Mazurka, the second
Nocturne and a Glinka fantasy - we wanted no more than another degree or two
of thrustful elan. He played the Mazurka so searchingly as almost to forget
its essential lilt. On the forthcoming CDs, what will he make of the
towering exuberance of the superb Sonata finale, the winsome glitter of the
last Waltzes and the Tarantella, the racing chiaroscuro, the marvellous
squib 'La Fileuse'? Given Walker's sympathetic strengths, and with no other
competitors in the field, the question pleads for a happy answer.

ScreenPlay; Safe (BBC2, 9.25) won two awards at the Edinburgh International
Film Festival this year, a not inconsiderable achievement for a small-budget
film against lavishly funded competitors. It is a typical teenage romance of
our time, which means to say that it is about homelessness, drugs, alcohol
and prostitution.
Notes written on lavatory paper by hunger striker Bobby Sands in the Maze
Prison in Northern Ireland are treasured by Republicans as if they were holy
relics of early Christian martyrs. Timewatch: Hunger Strike, a Hidden
History (BBC2, 8.00) disinters the ghastly 1981 confrontation between the
British government and Republican 'martyrs', 10 of whom fasted to death.
Another jail-death, this time inflicted by the state through lethal
injection, is examined in Inside Story: Rector versus Clinton (BBC 1, 9.30).
In January 1992, with poll ratings looking queasy, governor Bill Clinton
showed his cloven hoof - or if you prefer, his passion for justice.
He rejected the appeal for clemency of Rickey Ray Rector, a mentally ill
black murderer.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Business and the Environment: In the bag in Tokyo - Changes
to rubbish collection rules have caused uproar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Eiko Fukagawa, a 40-year-old housewife in Tokyo, turned on her
television last August, she was surprised to see an unfamiliar advert with a
film star shaking a translucent rubbish bag, telling viewers about new
rubbish collection rules due to begin this month. 'At first I didn't quite
understand what it was about,' she says.
Fukagawa was not the only one confused by the sudden changes. The Tokyo
metropolitan government's decision to enforce the separation of combustible
and unburnable waste using translucent bags, has caused such an uproar among
residents, retailers and plastic manufacturers that city officials have been
forced to postpone the changes until January.
The new rules, which require rubbish to be thrown away in semi-transparent
bags approved by the metropolitan government, apply to the 3.4m households
in Tokyo's central 23 wards. In order to burn easily, the polyethylene bags
must contain 30 per cent calcium carbonate. Initial plans also required
residents to write their names on the bags.
However, the unexpected announcement and rumours that rubbish thrown away in
bags other than the designated type would not be collected, caused panic
buying of translucent bags, triggering shortages at supermarkets. Amid the
confusion, some households were visited by door-to-door salesmen claiming to
be Tokyo metropolitan government employees, trying to sell translucent
rubbish bags at high prices.
On October 1, only about 10 per cent of the rubbish was thrown away in the
designated bags. The confusion was such that Shunichi Suzuki, governor of
Tokyo, had to apologise before the city assembly. 'The Tokyo government is
to be blamed for the short notice over the rule changes,' he said.
Many people are still unhappy at having to pay double the price of the
ordinary plastic rubbish bags for the designated ones. And the requirement
to label the bags with residents' names drew so many complaints from people
who saw the rule as an invasion of privacy that it was abolished.
Retailers still hold stocks of black plastic and paper rubbish bags and
manufacturers are unable to catch up with the demand for the new translucent
ones.
Other Japanese cities which have implemented similar changes in rubbish
collection rules have owed their success partly to starting their
promotional campaigns one or two years before their implementation.
The Tokyo government, which started publicising the changes in mid-August,
admits that the campaign period was too short. 'We now realise we need time
to make people understand the purpose of the changes and to allow retailers
and manufacturers to get rid of their inventories,' says a spokesman at the
Tokyo sanitation bureau.
However, the spokesman adds, the tumult has brought Tokyo's rubbish problem
to the centre of everyone's attention. 'Awareness of the seriousness of the
situation needs to be raised,' he says.
Having seen a sharp increase in rubbish during the economic 'bubble period'
of the late 1980s - last year's Tokyo garbage total was 4.5m tonnes - the
city's existing waste landfill will be full in two-and-a-half years. A new
landfill, planned for the Tokyo Bay, is expected to last only 20 years.
The Tokyo sanitation bureau says that Tokyo's unburnable waste contains 20
per cent combustible rubbish, increasing the bulk of waste put into
landfills, while its burnable waste contains 10 per cent unburnable rubbish,
which decreases the burning efficiency of the incinerators. By making people
use translucent bags, 'they will be more responsible for their rubbish,'
says the bureau.
The new rule is also expected to protect Tokyo's rubbish collectors, who
face a high risk of being injured by broken glass and bamboo skewers in the
bags.
Over the next three months, the city government intends to increase its
campaign activities, and explain to residents what is burnable and what is
not. The city intends to collect 'incorrect' rubbish for a while after it
implements the rule changes in January.
Meanwhile, the city's sanitation bureau faces a challenge from plastic bag
manufacturers, who are unhappy with the rule changes.
'We weren't even consulted,' says the Japan Polyolefin Industry Association,
which says many of the smaller plastic bag makers may be hit by the shift in
new requirements.
'Making the designated polyethylene bags containing calcium carbonate means
capital investment, which is hard for smaller makers already facing hard
times due to the bad economy,' says the association, which officially handed
in a complaint to the Tokyo metropolitan government last week.
The association is also challenging Tokyo's notion that the bags containing
calcium carbonate will burn more easily than traditional polyethylene bags.
It contends that since the designated bags are thicker than the usual
polyethylene bags, the amount of heat needed to burn them does not differ
radically.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Business and the Environment: A dirty and dangerous legacy -
The German government's clean-up plans for former Soviet-run uranium mines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some of the road signs in deepest Saxony are rusty. But there is no
mistaking the route to Wismut, one of the largest uranium mines on the
European continent.
Follow the direction leading to the giant, brown mountains of waste dug out
from the mines. Then, just a few kilometres before the small town of Aue,
turn off and drive along a small road. There, former miners who spent years
underground are now working on state-financed job creation schemes, weeding,
mending the roads and putting up fresh signs. Before German unification,
there was hardly any need for signs. Wismut was out of bounds.
'Wismut was a state within a state,' says Jana Bienick, a 29-year-old
official at Aue's city hall. 'It had its own hospitals, its own
kindergartens, its own transport system. It was a system within a system.
But not anymore,' she added.
'But please, just remember, it was not that bad. There has been a lot of
negative propaganda about Wismut. When the press was allowed to come here in
1990, some journalists were afraid to get out of the car in case they would
get contaminated. They did not understand that it was not like that at all.
We want companies to invest here.'
The uranium mines in eastern Germany straddle the states of Saxony and
Thuringia. Dating back to medieval times, they provided a livelihood for the
local population because they also contained silver deposits. But when the
Red Army took control of the former East Germany after the second world war,
it was not interested in silver, but uranium, crucial for building up its
nuclear capability.
The Soviets were set on tapping the potential of the hydrothermal vein
deposits near Aue which contained high percentages of uranium. As a means of
seeking war reparations, the Soviet Union confiscated the mines and, in
1947, placed them under a company called the Sowjetische Aktiengesellschaft
(SAG) Wismut. Seven years later, Moscow euphemistically created a joint
venture in the region, called Sowjetisch-Deutsche AG (SDAG) Wismut. Soviet
miners and engineers were moved to the region to supervise the digging of
the mines. The Soviet Ministry of Defence issued the instructions.
Wismut was worth the reparations. Between 1946 and 1990, more than 220,000
tonnes of uranium were mined and shipped to the Soviet Union. 'That was
about a third of the world's production,' says Werner Runge, spokesman for
Wismut.
Throughout this period, a top security network, employing 40,000 people, was
created. 'The entire system was tightly controlled,' explains Runge.
'Special buses collected the employees to and from work. It was a highly
organised state within a state. People's lives were intrinsically linked to
Wismut. It is difficult for them now to adapt to the new conditions. Less
than 4,500 workers are today employed on the sites. Not to mine, but to
clean up.'
The task is awesome. As soon as the German government secured control of the
mines after October 1990 and closed them down, Klaus Topfer, the country's
environment minister, moved quickly to assess how long and how much it would
cost to try to decontaminate, or stabilise, the sites.
Under Soviet control, the waste rock from the mining was normally piled
outside mine-shafts, with little effort made to replace it into the
exhausted mine volumes.
The waste rock contains small but significant amounts of radioactive,
unprocessed low-grade uranium. Vast piles can be seen near Aue: 42 of them
cover an area of 310 hectares and a volume of 45 cu m. At the Ronnenburg
site in Thuringia, the amount is even larger - 100 cu m of waste.
The federal authorities have embarked on a massive two-stage investment
programme totalling DM13bn (Pounds 5.2bn). First is an attempt to level off
the high piles to avoid mini-avalanches. The piles cannot be disposed of due
to their size and because there are no suitable alternative sites in this
fairly densely populated area.
Plans also include creating channels to run down the piles to prevent
rainfall seepage and contamination of what remains of the uncontaminated
water supply. Progress so far has been remarkable. More than 30 hectares
have been recultivated. Although no vegetables fit for human consumption
will be grown, some grass and plants have been sown.
The second stage of the programme is more difficult. When digging in mines
stops, the water levels, contained during the mining through pumping, rise.
The underground water in Wismut is contaminated so the authorities have to
be careful to avoid further contamination by flooding.
Dietmar Rosmej, an engineer who worked at Wismut until all mining was
stopped in late 1990, says this task is vast. 'As part of the programme, we
have to prevent any fresh rain water coming into contact with the underwater
levels.' The government estimates it will take 15 years to stabilise the
region.
The inhabitants of Aue have mixed feelings about the clean-up. Some regret
the loss of job security. 'The closure of Wismut means very high
unemployment,' says Michelle, a mother on a job creation scheme at the city
hall.
Others are almost defensive about the past 40 years. 'Oh, well. We were born
here. We worked all our lives here. It was OK. We had everything we wanted,'
says Heinrich, a technician who is helping with the clean-up at Wismut.
But most agree that the closure will mean a healthier and safer environment
for the next generation. One official at Wismut reckons more than 8,000
people have serious health problems, particularly cancer, from working at
Wismut.
Even those who did not work directly with the mines were affected, as the
contaminated underground water levels seeped through the cellars of houses.
'Some homes will have to be specially insulated,' says Runge. Yes, it was
pretty bad at times. But now we have to look towards the future.'

FT  13 OCT 93 / Management: How to tell a bastard from an ingratiator / A
look at who attends training courses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN FURNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most organisations make some investment in training their staff in
management techniques: they either hire training consultants, staff an
in-house department or, in addition, send managers on external training
courses (often a combination of all three).
The courses come in various packages with different titles. There are the
skill-based courses, teaching such topics as negotiation, presentation,
social or time-management skills.
Others on offer are developmental workshops, customer-focused programmes and
modified business-school courses.
Just as people come to resemble their dogs, so trainers seem to have
personalities that fit their courses. The presentation course tutor is
immaculate; the customer-driven trainer exceptionally attentive to your
needs, and the lecturer for the finance course for non-financial managers
highly numerate.
But what about the people who attend training courses? Many experienced,
full-time trainers tend to develop simple typologies to describe training
course attenders or delegates.
Cabin crew, waitresses, nurses, traffic wardens and all those who deal with
the general public as their customers also classify people into different
groups
(with sometimes unflattering labels).
It is a shorthand to characterise the large numbers of individuals whom they
encounter.
These typologies, of course, pigeon-hole. They are prototypes that may never
exist in pure form but which amuse the trainers who recognise their generic
characteristics.
They refer to the attitudes and behaviours of the delegates. Indeed they may
also reflect the delegates' attitudes to their work. The following
categories cover the vast majority of individuals:
The prisoner: the scowl on the face, the arms tightly folded across the
chest and the folded letter from the boss or personnel demanding - requiring
 -that they have to attend the course, characterise this type. They have
probably managed to avoid this course, or ones like it, many times before,
but eventually are caught. They are prisoners - they do not want to be there
and wish they were somewhere else. They are sour, negative, unhelpful and
unco-operative.
The escapee: this type is the course-junkie who jumps at the opportunity to
get out of the office. They may hate their work or simply enjoy education
and training at the company's expense.
The escapee is usually rather too experienced at course activities, games
and questionnaires and may well have done them before.
They are easy to deal with from the trainer's point of view, but not good
value for money from the perspective of their company.
The old dog: there are various reasons why some people believe they cannot
be taught new tricks. Some delegates are on-the-job retirees, in the
departure lounge of the organisation. They may be quite a long way from
retirement, but they are
not interested in learning anything.
Others believe courses are too abstract, too theoretical, too vague and have
nothing to add to their day-to-day working lives.
The eager-beaver: this type comes in two forms. The first is the
enthusiastic learner, genuinely interested in gaining skills, insights and
knowledge. The second is the slightly naive delegate who is happy to take
anything on board but has few critical faculties.
This makes them gullible and unfocused, though certainly easy for the
trainer.
The intellectual: whereas the old dog may reject what he has been told
because it is too vague and theoretical, the intellectual wants to know the
empirical and epistemological bases of the data being presented. Many are
snobs who believe that they know more than the trainer (sometimes they do).
These high-flyers may believe either the content or the style is not
appropriate for their level. They may enjoy humiliating the trainer if they
can.
The bastard: familiar to UK prime minister John Major, they are arrogant
know-it-alls. They usually believe personnel departments should be closed,
all consultants fired and the money put into the company's pension fund.
In a curious way, they enjoy courses in the same way that they enjoy
meetings, because they have learnt to create the maximum disruption. They
may be simple attention-seekers and in some organisations they are
intellectually under-powered.
They are a nightmare for trainers because they are solely interested in
scuppering or damaging the proceedings.
The ingratiator: many people are anxious when attending courses because they
fear being shown up in front of others. These people tend to be what
Americans charmingly call 'apple polishers'.
The ingratiator tries to do a deal with the trainer: 'I will be a good
boy/good girl if you don't expose or humiliate me.' And for trainers it is a
good deal.
Most trainers will probably recognise the above, although they may have
rather different categories or titles.
And they also know that different companies tend to have more or less of
each type.
Thus the publicly owned bureaucracy probably sends mainly old dogs, escapees
and prisoners to courses, while the successful private company
may send rather a lot of intellectuals and the occasional ingratiator.
Next time you are on a course, look around the room, and see who's in.

FT  13 OCT 93 / People: Lessels adds Tilney to boardroom duties
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Norman Lessels has added another arrow to his quiver of non-executive
directorships by becoming chairman of Tilney &amp; Co, the private client
stockbrokers, who resumed an independent existence earlier this month.
Lessels, 55, is a professional non-executive chairman and director. Though
he is the senior partner of the Edinburgh chartered accountants Chiene &amp;
Tait, his boardroom activities take up 90 per cent of his time.
Lessels' career as a non-executive director began in 1980 when he left the
accountants Ernst &amp; Whinney, who did not encourage its partners to sit on
boards.
He is chairman of Standard Life, the Edinburgh-based mutual, and of the
quoted Scottish companies Cairn Energy and Havelock Europa. He is also
chairman of several unquoted companies, and on the boards of Bank of
Scotland, Scottish Eastern Investment Trust, Bupa and the Securities and
Investment Board. He has never been a rescue chairman.
'My biggest agony is trying to get my diary into shape,' says Lessels, a
calm, friendly and precise Edinburgh man who went to the Edinburgh Academy,
an incubator for the Scottish accountancy and legal networks.
Though Tilney's base in Liverpool is out of his usual area, he says it is
convenient for Chester, where he sits on the board of NWS Bank, a Bank of
Scotland subsidiary, and for Wilmslow, Cheshire, where he is director of
General Surety and Guarantee, an offshoot of Swiss Re.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Management: A border terrier - Ben Verwaayen of the
Netherlands' PTT Telecom welcomes change / Euromanagers to Watch watch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE last thing you would expect to find hanging in the office of one of
Europe's top telecommunications executives is a McDonald's advertisement.
But Ben Verwaayen, president of PTT Telecom, the Netherlands' telephone
operator, has enshrined the US company's Big Mac on his wall for a very good
reason.
For nearly five years, Verwaayen, 41, has been telling his 33,500-strong
staff that if PTT Telecom is to survive in the turbulent, competitive world
of international telecommunications, it must be customer-led, not simply
technology-driven. 'At the end of the day, it's like McDonald's: they don't
just sell hamburgers, they sell a service as well.' The Big Mac on the wall
is a reminder to all that they are, at heart, in a service industry.
'When I came here people were convinced that we sold technology. To me
that's really nonsense,' says Verwaayen. 'No one is interested in opening up
a telephone set to look at the circuit boards and admire their quality.'
What they want, he says, is reliable, quick and imaginative service.
Verwaayen, who came to the job with a degree in law and an extensive
background in personnel management, public relations and business
development at ITT in the Netherlands, makes no claims to being a technical
wizard. 'I have two left hands,' he jokes. 'If I have to change a light bulb
at home, I have to call on my wife to give me assistance.'
But self-deprecating humour does little to disguise Verwaayen's central role
in telecommunications, both at home and, increasingly, abroad.
His company is the main operating subsidiary - as measured by turnover and
by profit, not by employees - of Royal PTT Netherlands (KPN), the Dutch
state-owned postal and telecommunications authority due to be floated on the
Amsterdam Stock Exchange in several tranches starting next year.
KPN, the biggest corporate employer in the country, with a workforce of
nearly 102,000, has undergone rapid internal change since it was turned into
a limited company in 1989 and allowed to operate at arm's length from the
government.
PTT Telecom is also a founding partner of a three-way European joint venture
called Unisource, which is designed to enable the telecommunications
companies of the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland to compete with the
industry's giants for the lucrative but demanding business of operating
internal communications networks for the world's multinational companies.
Given his role and his company, Verwaayen is closely involved not only in
managing a change in corporate culture but also in the art of conducting
cross-border joint ventures.
When he arrived at the company in 1988, PTT Telecom was a state agency with
a hierarchical top-to-bottom structure. Telephone operators and repair staff
were at the bottom of the pile, carrying out duties according to a rule book
rather than in keeping with customers' demands.
Verwaayen and his team turned the structure by 90 degrees, emphasising
contact with the customer rather than internal bureaucracy. 'We now have a
front office and a back office, and I'm sitting all the way in the back,' he
says. 'Everyone in the back office is only to be measured by what they do
for people in the front office.'
Verwaayen's approach to shaking up the company cannot be reduced to any easy
formula or any standard method of presentation. 'I take every soapbox that I
can find,' he says.
His message, delivered energetically and often, is that change should be
embraced, not avoided, and that everyone in the front office with direct
contact with the customer should be an 'ambassador' for the company.
Compared with the task of making PTT Telecom a service-orientated outfit,
next year's privatisation is expected to have only a minor impact on
Verwaayen's management style and priorities. However, Verwaayen, who admits
to being blunt, says stock exchange rules on disclosing profit forecasts
mean that 'I'll have to be more careful about what I say and when I say it'.
So far, progress has been made in shaking up PTT Telecom. Verwaayen says the
company is half-way through its process of internal reorganisation, and
about three-quarters of the way home in changing its business mentality. But
more needs to be done.
At the level of individual employees, for example, the results are more
mixed. 'There's a certain percentage, though less than 10 per cent, which
still thinks the old days were better than the present days,' he says. 'We
also have at least 25 per cent of people who think that we are not moving
quickly enough.'
Of all the decisions he has had to take, the single most important was the
agreement to launch Unisource. This had the effect of carving out PTT
Telecom's most international business and putting it in a separate joint
venture with the Swedes and, later, with the Swiss.
Verwaayen, who spends up to 60 per cent of his time on Unisource-related
business, rejects the view that cross-border joint ventures are a recipe for
failure, especially if they involve three partners in three different
countries.
The key to Unisource's success, he believes, is that the Dutch, the Swedes
and the Swiss not only share the same objective but also the same motivation
in pooling their international activities for multinationals. Each, he says,
is convinced that a joint approach is the only way they can survive and, at
the same time, remain the masters of their own destiny.
The arrangement inevitably brings to the fore cultural differences. 'The
Dutch are not great diplomats. We are very straight-forward,' Verwaayen
says, noting that the Swedes and the Swiss have 'subtle methods' of
correcting traditional Dutch bluntness.
PTT Telecom's move to spin off services to multinationals into a joint
venture is a serious step for any organisation to take, but Verwaayen
believes that his staff have come to accept the step, despite the challenges
involved.
Those employees who relished the thought of greater international travel now
also realise that decision-making has shifted to a European rather than a
national plane.
'I'm convinced that if I were replaced in this organisation tomorrow for one
good reason or another, my successor would find an organisation believing in
Unisource and working as well with our partners as they do today, perhaps
even better,' he says.
