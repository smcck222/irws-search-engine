FT  11 OCT 93 / The Week Ahead Results Due
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ANALYSTS ARE today expecting annual pre-tax profits of about Pounds 40m to
Pounds 50m from Lucas Industries, the motor components and aerospace group,
compared with Pounds 22.5m last time. This year's total will be enhanced by
about Pounds 12m of disposal profits. Trading continues to be tough and some
fear the dividend may be cut.
Interim results to the end of August from natural cosmetics and toiletries
retailer Body Shop on Thursday are expected to show pre-tax profits of
Pounds 9m to Pounds 9.3m, against Pounds 8.3m last time. The UK is still
likely to be depressed compared with a relatively good first half last year.
The US contribution will be affected by currency translation, although
stores in the region are expected to have traded well. Elsewhere sales
growth is expected to have been sustained. A lower interest charge is also
predicted.
Highland Distilleries is expected to report full year pre-tax profits today
of about Pounds 39m, including Pounds 10m from the change to equity
accounting of its 35 per cent stake in Robertson &amp; Baxter, the whisky
distiller. At the trading level, profits are likely to show a near 10 per
cent increase to Pounds 24m with continuing benefits coming from Remy
Cointreau's distribution of Highland's Famous Grouse whisky.
Tomorrow St Ives, the UK's largest independent printer, is expected to
report full-year pre-tax profits of about Pounds 22m, slightly ahead of last
year's Pounds 21.1m. The results will be the first since Mr Miles Emley took
over as chairman from Mr Robert Gavron.

FT  11 OCT 93 / The Week Ahead: UK recovery back in the spotlight -
Economics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RUSH OF figures from the UK this week may, if good, quell misgivings about
the strength of the recovery, with data on inflation, output, unemployment
and retail sales expected.
The retail price inflation figures will be awaited with particular
apprehension following August's surprisingly sharp increase. Many analysts
have promoted the view that inflation in the UK is 'dead' and were shocked
to see the headline rate leap from 1.4 per cent to 1.7 per cent. Underlying
inflation - which excludes mortgage interest payments  - rose from 2.9 per
cent to 3.1 per cent.
Forecasts for manufacturing output are modestly upbeat, and analysts expect
unemployment to remain where it is - 10.4 per cent of the workforce.
This is also a busy week for statistics in the US. Economists will be
looking to see whether figures for retail sales, initial claims, industrial
production and trade figures confirm the gloomy picture of the economy
highlighted in last week's non-farm payroll figures.

FT  11 OCT 93 / UK Gilts: Dealers pin hopes on inflation figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOND specialists are hoping publication this week of the latest figures for
UK retail-price inflation will breathe new life into a lacklustre gilt
market.
A month ago, gilts suffered a sharp fall after a higher than expected
increase in inflation in August. An inflation figure for September
substantially different from the one anticipated by gilt dealers is likely
to move the market substantially.
This week also sees publication of a range of other UK economic data,
including the latest unemployment figures and details of factory goods
inflation last month, which may influence the market after a run of two
weeks of muted yield reductions.
Last week, long-dated gilts saw a fall in yields of about 10 basis points,
with the yield on 15-year bonds being quoted on Friday night at just over 7
per cent on a par basis.
The market's subdued recovery from the surprise of a 1.7 per cent increase
in the retail prices index in the year to August has been mainly due to the
generally good performance of other European bond markets. There has also
been the perception in the UK that the recovery is weakening, a factor
helping drive the belief that inflationary forces are still relatively
insubstantial.
On Wednesday, the Central Statistical Office will announce the year-on-year
rise in the RPI to last month. City analysts expect this will stay at 1.7
per cent. They also believe the Treasury's figure for underlying inflation -
the year-on-year rise in the RPI, excluding mortgage interest payments -
will be 3.1 per cent last month, the same as in the year to August.
Behind these expectations is the feeling that the UK economic recovery is
running out of steam, a view backed by a survey of opinion among nearly
2,000 British companies published today by Dun &amp; Bradstreet, a business
information company. This says the upturn is 'flattening out', with more
than a fifth of employers not planning to give staff pay increases over the
next year.
More evidence of weak economic conditions will be sent privately by fax
later today to UK Treasury economists from the House Builders' Federation.
This is a trade association which every Monday sends the department data on
the latest level of demand for new houses as registered by 26 of Britain's
big housebuilding companies.
The Treasury uses this data in trying to monitor economic conditions in the
UK generally, part of its new-found interest in following events in a range
of specific industrial sectors.
The federation's latest figures indicate subdued demand for new houses, a
big factor in the sluggish pace of growth in the past six months. Mr Roger
Humber, the federation's director, says: 'The housing business has seen some
improvement from last year. But last year was terrible. We're still some way
from being where we would like to be.'
As for other industrial sectors, Mr Kevin Mahoney, managing director of
double-glazing company Caradon Everest and a member of the Treasury's
industrial prospects committee, says demand in his sector is patchy,
adding:'We're unlikely to see any rapid take off (in overall demand)'.
While sentiment like this persists in the business world, demand for gilts
is likely to remain relatively strong, keeping prices at around existing
levels.
The Bank of England is selling from today Pounds 950m of gilts in three
tranches: Pounds 350m of 7 per cent Treasury bonds due 2001, Pounds 350m of
8 3/4 per cent Treasury stock due 2017 and Pounds 250m of index-linked 2 1/2
per cent bonds due 2011. The 2001 stock is being issued at a price of 101
15/16 , the gilts due 2017 at 118 and the index-linked stock at 168 5/8.

FT  11 OCT 93 / US Money and Credit: Employment report kicks bond market
back into life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US BOND market, which has been trapped in a narrow trading range
recently, has needed something to kick-start it back into life in the past
couple of weeks. That something arrived last Friday in the shape of the
September employment report.
The monthly jobs data sparked a strong rally in Treasury prices, with
particularly heavy buying by retail investors. By the day's end, the 30-year
bond had climbed by 1 1/4 points, and the yield had dropped from near 6 per
cent to 5.917 per cent - close to its historic low.
At first glance, the bond market's reaction looked grossly overdone. The
main figures - non-farm payrolls up 156,000 and the national unemployment
rate steady at 6.7 per cent - were right in line with expectations. Traders
and investors, however, quickly looked beyond the headline numbers and found
plenty to get excited about.
Among the data that lifted the bond market's spirits were: yet another fall
in manufacturing jobs; a flat manufacturing work-week; a lower overall
average work-week; no wage inflation; and a revision that showed an even
bigger decline than previously reported in August non-farm payrolls.
Much of the overall increase in payrolls was accounted for by a big increase
in government hirings, which rose by 71,000.
Taken together, the figures told a familiar story. The economy continues to
grow slowly, creating new jobs at a subnormal pace, and lack of growth in
the labour market should help keep a lid on inflation.
All of this is clearly positive for bonds, which explains why prices took
off on Friday. The data should also ensure that Federal Reserve policy will
remain on hold for at least another few months.
The chances that monetary policy will not be tightened soon has also been
boosted by the news that the Fed's most well known anti-inflation 'hawk',
governor Wayne Angell, is leaving the Federal Reserve Board at the end of
this year.
As brokerage house Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette commented: 'With his
departure, there will be one less member of the FOMC (the Fed's
policy-making Open Market Committee) fighting against the grain.'
DLJ also noted that the FOMC has a new member, in the form of Mr William
McDonough, who took over the helm at the New York Fed a few months ago.
The brokerage house says that recent comments by McDonough suggest he is
concerned by the economy's poor performance, but satisfied with current
levels of inflation.
Angell's departure and McDonough's arrival can only shift the balance of
power at the Fed further in favour of those who are more worried by the lack
of economic growth than any possibility of a resurgence in inflation.
This week's producer and consumer prices data for September should be a
reminder of how non-threatening inflation is today.
So far this year, consumer prices have risen at an annual rate of 2.8 per
cent (down from 3.0 per cent last year) and producer prices at a rate of
just 0.6 per cent (down from 2.1 per cent last year).
Wall Street is expecting more of the same when the figures are released on
Thursday and Friday. Analysts forecast that producer prices will have risen
by about 0.3 per cent last month and consumer prices by about 0.2 per cent.
If the numbers come in no higher than forecast, then bond prices could post
fresh gains, sending long-dated yields down to new lows, and possibly even
below 5.9 per cent for the first time.
The US bond market will be closed today because of the Columbus Day holiday.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Dutch Bonds: Yield gap with German bunds expected to narrow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DUTCH government bonds are set to outperform other D-Mark bloc markets
near-term, underpinned by their supply advantage, but the yield gap between
Dutch and German bonds is expected to narrow towards year-end as Dutch
issuance resumes and the two countries' inflation rates begin to converge.
With Thursday's sale of Fl 2.8bn of 30-year 7.5 per cent Dutch State Loans
the government has all but completed its 1993 funding programme, leaving
only some Fl 1.5bn to be raised through private placements and on the money
market.
Last week's auction of state loans was a roaring success, boosted by heavy
bidding from foreign investors who snapped up about 90 per cent of the
issue.
There will be no more auctions until the end of the year, when the
government starts front-funding next year's deficit.
'We plan to hold our traditional December issue around mid-December,' said
an official at the national debt office.
The 1994 borrowing requirement is set at Fl 51.5bn, barring any early
redemptions to the government.
This year, such early redemptions cut the funding requirement to Fl 40.7bn
from a forecast Fl 45bn, the official said.
The Dutch supply situation compares favourably with that of Germany, where
the bund market will have to digest another four long-dated issues and three
medium-dated debt issues, which are expected to total around DM50bn, before
the end of the year.
A further advantage over Germany is that the Dutch bond market, with
maturities of up to 30 years, offers investors a significant duration
pick-up over bunds, the maximum maturity of which is 10 years.
'For duration-junkies, this is the place to be,' says a trader. France also
has a liquid 30-year sector but currency worries there have been putting
many investors off.
The past few weeks have seen widespread maturity-lengthening by
international investors amid fading hopes for near-term interest rate cuts.
Central banks across Europe are waiting for the Bundesbank to kick off the
next round of rate cuts, but even when that does happen, the easing pace is
expected to remain very cautious, underpinning longer maturities most.
'On the Dutch yield curve, the best strategy is the duration strategy,' said
Mr Torsten Bohler, bond analyst at UBS.
Despite last week's surge, the 30-year 7.5 per cent bond still looks quite
cheap, said one trader, who pointed out that at 51 basis points, the spread
between the 30-year and 10-year yield was well above its 39 basis point low
earlier this year.
The bond also looks attractive compared with the US long bond, offering a
yield pick-up of some 42 basis points.
Lastly, the Dutch 30-year is one of the few bonds in Europe's core markets
that offers a positive cost of carry - a yield above money-market funding
rates.
Dutch three-month money currently trades around 6.28 per cent while the
30-year bond yields some 6.39 per cent.
In the 10-year sector, Mr Bohler at UBS expects the Dutch yield to move as
much as 20 basis points below the bund yield near-term, largely on the
supply argument. Late on Friday, the yield gap was nine basis points.
However, the market's outperformance may not last far into the next year as
the Dutch economy, which stagnated this year, stages a faster recovery than
Germany's.
UBS is forecasting GDP growth of 1.5 per cent, compared with forecasts for
0.7 per cent German GDP growth.
Moreover, with the Dutch guilder firmly pegged to the D-Mark, there is
little scope for currency appreciation on economic outperformance.
Meanwhile, the inflation gap between the two countries, which has helped
boost the Dutch market, is widely expected to narrow to around 0.5 per cent
next year, implying that Dutch yields will move back into line with
Germany's.
Dutch inflation in August was 2.0 per cent, compared with Germany's 4.2 per
cent. A Dutch September inflation number clearly below 2 per cent is
expected to be released this week; in Germany, the September rate was 4.0
per cent.
The Dutch elections, expected in May, could also cause temporary volatility,
although most observers feel that, whichever party wins, the country's
commitment to running a tight fiscal policy will remain on course.

FT  11 OCT 93 / International Bonds: Finland helps Eurosterling sector back
to life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROSTERLING sector of the international bond market has bounced back to
life, helped by a sizeable new issue from Finland last week and the prospect
of further new issuance in the coming week.
Depfa (Germany's largest mortgage bank), Fisons, and Turkey are three of the
names being talked about in the market as likely to launch Eurosterling
deals this week, although a big question mark hangs over the latter.
On Friday, Moody's, the credit rating agency, placed Turkey's rating under
review for possible downgrade because of concern about its deteriorating
public finances. Turkey has a long-term debt rating of Baa3 from Moody's,
making it investment grade. If Moody's lowers the rating, it would fall into
the sub-investment grade category.
At worst, Turkey's Eurosterling issue could be postponed until a decision on
the debt rating is taken, although market participants on Friday thought the
deal would probably still go ahead but with a more generous yield pick-up
over gilts than the 220 basis points initially indicated by the lead
manager.
This year has seen a record amount of Eurosterling issuance, admittedly at a
time when the international bond market as a whole is witnessing record
volume. Eurosterling issuance so far this year has reached Pounds 25.012bn,
up from 1992's total of Pounds 13.107bn, according to figures compiled by
Euromoney.
Much of this year's issuance, however, took place in the first and second
quarters. Foreign investors were willing to buy sterling assets to take
advantage of currency appreciation, while investors in general were
attracted by the relatively high yields and the prospect of falling interest
rates. Borrowers hungry for funds took advantage of the demand and in many
cases the deals were swap-driven.
Eurosterling yield spreads over appropriate gilts have declined quite
substantially this year. For example, the SG Warburg Securities All-Stocks
Non-Gilt Index shows the average spread over gilts has fallen from 98 basis
points at the end of 1992, to a low of 58 basis points on August 24, and
stood at 61 basis points on Friday.
For example, BT launched a 10-year Pounds 500m issue at a spread of 18 basis
points over the gilt on August 25. Since then, the spread has tightened
considerably and last Friday, Lehman Brothers, joint lead manager for the
deal, was quoting a spread over the gilt of 3 basis points (bid) or flat
(offer).
'Spreads have been tight and they are now beginning to reach a low,' said
one dealer, adding that this was a reflection of strong demand from overseas
investors, many of whom were attracted by Eurosterling yields and the
prospect of sterling appreciation, particularly against a background of
declining European interest rates.
After a period of consolidation in September, the sector appears to have
recovered and rumours of further new issuance have started to circulate.
However, despite investors' calls for long-dated paper, new supply is likely
to be concentrated in the short and medium-dated areas given the positive
shape of the yield curve. Most issuance this year has been in the six to
10-year area, with this sector accounting for Pounds 12.509bn, compared with
Pounds 6.311bn in the one to five-year area.
A few names in the financial sector have opted for longer-dated subordinated
capital but corporate names have steered clear of the ultra-long area. 'If
you are a corporate borrower, it is difficult to convince your board to lock
into interest rates at 9 per cent at the long end when short interest rates
are 6 per cent,' said one dealer.
It seems unlikely that corporate borrowers will issue ultra-long bonds
unless the yield curve starts to flatten. 'At present, any company which
borrows at the long end and does not put the money to immediate use is going
to suffer an enormous opportunity cost of carry,' said Mr Tony Moverley of
Baring Sterling Bonds. Also, most corporate borrowers expect long-term
interest rates to continue to decline, perhaps to 6.75 - 7.00 per cent from
the current level of 7.2 per cent.
'Frankly, most UK corporates can afford to wait,' says Mr Peter Capel of
Hoare Govett.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Risk and Reward: Volatility a derivative of the new US
accounting standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US BANKS and insurance companies will have more market risks to manage when
new US accounting standards come into effect in January. The rules require
countless capital-sensitive institutions to reconsider the assets in their
portfolio, and in some cases, mark them to market for the first time, , that
is, price a position or portfolio at current market prices.
Assets not intended to be held to maturity must either be classified as
'available for sale', and marked to market, with unrealised gains and losses
reflected in equity, or counted as 'trading' with unrealised gains and
losses affecting income.
That is a shock to the more conservative banks that value assets at
historical amortised cost. If a bank has long-term bonds in its portfolio
and cannot prove they will be held to maturity, the securities must be
marked to market quarterly.
Since the current low interest rate environment has been kind to long-term
investments, the initial effect on most institutions' equity will be
beneficial. But under the new rules, profitable portfolios will be subject
to the whims of the market, and even a small increase in interest rates at
the end of a reporting period could mean marking down asset values.
The new standards, dubbed Financial Accounting Standards Board rule 115 (FAS
115), will skew the true picture of the nation's banks and introduce
unnecessary capital volatility, according to the American Bankers
Association, the US banking lobby. Part of the ABA's objections are based on
the fact that FAS 115 addresses only one side of the balance sheet. Even if
a bank has perfectly matched assets and liabilities, only the assets will be
marked to market, conveying an inaccurate picture of its capital position.
The reaction by small banks has been to shorten their capital holdings.
Maturities of four years or under are far less volatile than long-term
bonds, though not nearly so profitable. With the yield curve at its steepest
level in years, shortening maturities could mean sacrificing 200 to 300
basis points in income, trimming earnings.
Given the recent history of US banking, bankers say they will gladly forgo
income to preserve capital and public confidence. Derivatives specialists
argue that the trade-off need not be so costly, and proper hedging can
insulate a portfolio from market volatility. Mr Craig Schiffer, managing
director for fixed income derivatives at Lehman Brothers, says he has seen a
big pick-up in interest in off-balance sheet products since FAS 115 was
announced in June.
Most popular with banks, he says, have been index amortising swaps, and
collateralised mortgage obligation (CMO) swaps. Where standard interest rate
swaps exchange coupons while principal remains unchanged, both of these
products allow for the principal to be drawn down if interest rates fall,
imitating mortgage prepayments.
Mr Richard Lodge, a senior vice president with Ohio-based BancOne, a
rapidly-expanding super-regional bank, says derivatives allow a bank to
customise its portfolio. 'You can get the kind of risk you want, and the
kind of maturities. That isn't available in the bond market. In the cash
market, you have to buy what's on the shelf.'
He admits his bank's enthusiasm for derivatives is rare and that invariably,
when BancOne buys a regional affiliate, it comes with little experience or
understanding of derivatives. Valley National Bank of Arizona, with Dollars
12bn in assets, had barely dabbled in derivatives when BancOne bought it a
year ago. A designed programme of derivatives stabilised its assets, and
with a recent subordinated debt issue, boosted capital ratios.
Still, Mr Lodge worries that FAS 115 will drive uninitiated bankers to
derivatives use for the wrong reason, and draw the attention, and ire, of
regulators already uneasy with the systemic risks associated with structured

'Most small and medium-sized banks don't have the means to manage them.'

<TEXT>
A NEW capitalisation-weighted index of 300 leading shares listed on the
Tokyo stock exchange is being launched.
The index is expected to end a two-year debate over the volatility of the
Nikkei 225 index, a simple price-weighted average of 225 stocks, which is
used by the Osaka Securities Exchange and overseas markets as a base for the
controversial stock futures contract.
Japanese financial authorities have blamed the heavy trading in the futures
market for driving investors away from the stock market. After a spate of
restrictions to curb trading in the futures and options markets failed to
bring investors back into stock investments, the ministry of finance and
stock exchange authorities agreed that the simple weighted index, which is
seen as easily manipulated, was at fault.
The Nihon Keizai Shimbun business newspaper said the Nikkei 300 was an
additional index and that the Nikkei 225 would continue to be used as a
benchmark for the Tokyo stock market. The Osaka exchange is expected to
introduce a new stock index futures contract based on the new index to
replace the Nikkei 225 futures contract next January.
The Nikkei 300 is heavily weighted in the banking sector, with 10 banks
comprising 23.77 per cent of the index's capitalisation.

FT  11 OCT 93 / International Company News: Tokyo cracks down on builders -
Robert Thomson writes on the latest Japanese political scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR the past few weeks, Japanese television viewers have watched the almost
nightly drama of construction company executives being hauled from their
homes and escorted to the Tokyo Detention Centre for questioning about their
role in an unfolding political scandal.
The construction industry is traditionally an important source of campaign
cash for Japanese politicians. At the last count, 18 executives from five
leading contractors had been arrested for alleged involvement in the bribery
of provincial government leaders. The public prosecutors continue to circle
the industry.
This crackdown by the authorities has come at a difficult time for
construction companies where margins are already under severe pressure from
the downturn in the economy and an accompanying 30 to 40 per cent fall in
property prices.
Most contractors have downgraded their profit forecasts for this year, and
the five companies implicated in the scandal - Taisei, Shimizu, Hazama,
Mitsui Construction, and Nishimatsu Construction - are likely to feel the
squeeze more than most. They are temporarily excluded from bidding for some
public works contracts.
'The situation is really very severe, and we will have to try to regain
confidence,' a manager at Taisei explained. Taisei was embarrassed this week
by the arrest of a vice-president over the company's Y20m (Dollars 190,000)
payment to a prefectural governor. Prosecutors say the payment was a bribe,
while Taisei insists that it was merely a political donation.
A court will ultimately decide, but the Construction Ministry has already
suspended Taisei from public works contracts for two months and local
governments might do the same. In an average year, the company said, public
works account for 20 per cent of orders, but the ratio had risen from 25 to
30 per cent this year.
Before the arrest this week, Taisei was expecting pre-tax profit for the six
months ended September to be 34.8 per cent lower than a year earlier on
sales down 6.4 per cent. The only positive turn for Taisei is that Japanese
interest rates are now at their lowest ever levels with the official
discount rate standing at 1.75 per cent.
In the case of Hazama, another implicated contractor, 47 prefectural
governments and 12 cities imposed temporary bidding bans, ranging from two
to four months, which the company said will remain in place until we 'are
designated as a bidder again'.
Under the Japanese bidding system for public works projects, a company must
be 'designated' by the authority responsible, which is under no obligation
to explain why a company is overlooked in the bidding, meaning that a
suspension may be indefinitely extended by some governments.
'We won't really know when the penalties are over until we are nominated
again,' Hazama said. 'Even though the period of our ban is two months, the
period will not exactly be two months. It is likely to be longer.'
Last week the company was forced to revise downwards its forecasts on
profits for the current corporate year, ending March. Its forecast for net
profits was lowered by 26.7 per cent on sales expected to be 12.7 per cent
lower than earlier estimated.
Hazama might benefit from an increase in public works orders next year, as
governments have held back in awarding contracts, fearing that the winner
may be entangled in the scandal, which would force the complicated award
procedure to be conducted again.
In August, government orders to the 50 largest contractors were down 42.7
per cent on a year earlier, the largest fall since the Construction Ministry
began collecting figures in 1959. In the same month, private orders were
down 9.3 per cent, partly reflecting the growing surplus of office space in
Tokyo and Osaka, the two largest cities.
The surplus is particularly acute in newer commercial areas, where buildings
sprouted during the late 1980s, the bubble era, and developers are still
completing the more ambitious projects planned during those heady days.
Officials at the Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company, established by
Japanese banks to clear away bad property-related loans, expect commercial
property prices to continue falling for at least another year.
Japanese manufacturers account for about 20 per cent of private construction
orders, but are reducing capital spending at home and expanding production
facilities in cheaper east Asian sites.
The Industrial Bank of Japan expects that capital spending this year will
slip by 2.3 per cent, the second consecutive fall, and the Bank of Japan has
warned that the higher yen could lead to a 'massive substitution' of
overseas investment.
In these harsh conditions, scandal is an unwelcome burden, but companies
which have avoided implication in the latest spate of allegations are likely
to receive a fresh flow of orders. For example, Obayashi this week raised
its pre-tax profit forecast from Y52bn to Y60bn for the year to March.
However, the company has cut the net profit forecast from Y23bn to Y13bn, as
it has chosen to confront a separate but common affliction for the industry,
over-exposure in the US property market. Obayashi is to liquidate three
subsidiaries and write off losses of Y30bn.

FT  11 OCT 93 / International Company News: US-Canadian consortium in
Chilean copper venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A US-CANADIAN consortium of Cyprus Minerals Company and Lac Minerals has
agreed to pay up to Dollars 555m for a 51 per cent stake in the El Abra
copper mine, Chile's largest-ever foreign joint venture. Codelco, Chile's
state copper company, is to hold the remaining 49 per cent in the project,
which is expected to cost Dollars 1bn to develop.
The Cyprus/Lac consortium will pay Dollars 404m on signing the contract, due
to take place in January, and an additional sum of up to Dollars 151m
depending on the mine's development costs. The consortium has also committed
itself to securing financing of Dollars 700m to meet investment
requirements.
El Abra, which could start production as early as 1997, was the biggest
copper deposit for sale in the world. Nine international consortia,
including such companies as RTZ of the UK and Australia's BHP Minerals,
submitted bids last month.
Such enormous interest highlights Chile's growing reputation for providing a
stable, long-term investment climate. Last year, Standard &amp; Poor's, the US
credit rating agency, awarded Chile an investment grade, the first to a
Latin American country since the debt crisis of the early 1980s.
The El Abra deal is seen by many officials as a breakthrough for Chile's
state-dominated mining sector, which has until recently resisted foreign
investment. Under a law passed last year, El Abra will be the first
state-owned copper deposit to be developed with the private sector.
Mr Alejandro Foxley, the finance minister, praised the policy of wooing
foreign investors to the mining industry: 'Why should we divert public funds
into areas where the private sector can invest? Then we can take that money
and put it into infrastructure - education, health services and job training
programmes. That's the real job of the government.'
Cyprus/Lac plans to produce 225,000 tonnes of copper cathodes annually over
20 years. The grade and relative accessibility of El Abra's oxide reserves
is expected to result in extremely low production costs. These should be 40
to 45 cents a pound against Codelco's current average of 69 cents.

RADEX HERAKLITH, the Austrian fireproofing materials and building supplies
group, reported a loss of Sch48.2m (Dollars 4.3m) for the first half of 1993
compared with a Sch59.4m profit in the same period last year. Revenues
dropped by 12 per cent to Sch4.37bn.
Mr Hellmut Longin, chief executive, forecast a slight improvement in
full-year profits from last year's Sch130.4m, mainly because of an
anticipated Sch80m to Sch90m profit at the Heraklith Baustoffe building
materials subsidiary.
Mr Longin also said that both Radex and its two quoted subsidiaries would
maintain their dividends.
The group has been hard hit by the slump in the steel industry. Its
Veitsch-Radex subsidiary is the world leader in supplying magnesite to line
blast furnaces.

AMDAHL, the struggling US mainframe computer manufacturer, said it expected
to report an operating loss for its third quarter 'considerably larger' than
its Dollars 23.7m second-quarter loss, writes Louise Kehoe in San Francisco.
The company blamed continuing 'depressed conditions' in the mainframe
computer market, together with 'intense competitive pressure on pricing' for
its losses.
Industry analysts said that International Business Machines, Amdahl's chief
competitor in the mainframe market, has been deeply discounting prices of
its mainframe computers in a bid to boost sluggish demand.
Amdahl's anticipated losses have raised raised concerns about IBM's
performance.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALCOA, the big US aluminium producer, said its own 25 per cent cutback in US
aluminium production in the third quarter had failed to bolster prices, and
that rising world aluminium inventories and a corresponding price slide led
to a 36 per cent drop in its third-quarter earnings, writes Laurie Morse in
Chicago.
The company said it earned Dollars 28.8m, or 32 cents per common share, in
the quarter, down from Dollars 45.3m, or 52 cents, in the same quarter last
year.
The quarterly results benefited from Dollars 22.6m in tax adjustments, and
included a Dollars 4m charge for employment reductions at Alcoa's
fabricating plant in Davenport, Iowa. Sales for the third quarter slipped to
Dollars 2.2bn, from Dollars 2.4bn a year ago.
For the first nine months, Alcoa had operating earnings of Dollars 96m or
Dollars 1.08 a share, although special charges reduced the total to Dollars
91.7m or Dollars 1.03.
In the comparable period last year, before a special accounting change, the
company earned Dollars 156.9m or Dollars 1.81 a share.

WORMS, the French holding company, reflecting the gloomy trend in the
corporate sector, announced a fall in net profits to FFr362m (Dollars 64m)
in the first six months of 1993 from FFr397m a year earlier.
The group, which recently reshuffled its interests by selling its
controlling stake in the Financiere Truffaut luxury goods conglomerate to Mr
Bernard Arnault, was affected in by the poor performance of some of its core
holdings, including the Saint-Louis food and transport group.
Profits from Saint-Louis fell to FFr252m in the first half from FFr462m last
year, partly due to high restructuring costs. Worms was also affected by the
problems of Compagnie Nationale de Navigation (CNN) in the oil
transportation sector. The losses from CNN rose to FFr46m from FFr8m.
Athena, the insurance company, suffered from the general pressures on the
French insurance sector. Net profits from Athena fell to FFr217m from
FFr257m. The losses from Arc Union, the property company, were reduced to
FFr49m from FFr167m while net profits from the Demachy Worms banking
business rose slightly to FFr44m from FFr41m.
The sale of the Financiere Truffaut shares yielded a profit for Worms of
FFr187m. The group also expects in the second half to make more exceptional
gains from the sale of its old corporate headquarters on Boulevard Haussmann
in Paris.

BHV, the French retail group best known for its department store by the
Hotel de Ville in Paris, suffered a sharp fall in interim net profits to
FFr9.5m (Dollars 1.7m) in the first half of this year from FFr20.2m in the
same period of 1992.
The group, like other French retailers, has come under pressure because of
the sluggish state of the economy. Consumer spending in France has been
static for some time, reflecting the high rate of real interest rates and
concern about rising unemployment.
News of the decline in BHV's profits follows shortly after a gloomy
announcement by Pinault-Printemps, another leading stores group, that its
interim net profits fell to FFr189m from FFr330m.
BHV's sales declined by 7.8 per cent to FFr1.89bn in the six months from
FFr1.75bn at last year's interim stage. As a result,it remained in the red
at the operational level with a loss of FFr21.2m, against FFr8m last year.
The company attributed the fall in sales and its operational losses to the
'difficult economic environment'.

<TEXT>
PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, has confirmed that it recently
arranged a sale and lease-back transaction with Rabobank, the big Dutch
co-operative bank, but declined to give any further details of the deal.
The company refused to comment on a Dutch radio programme which reported
that Rabobank had purchased certain intangible assets, such as patents and
technology licences, and then leased them back to Philips.
The programme said the transaction was arranged in the summer and was worth
several hundred million guilders.
Philips, which is redoubling efforts at asset management under its finance
director, Mr Dudley Eustace, would say only that the transaction had taken
place 'recently' but it refused to say what kind of assets were involved or
how much they were worth.
The deal received indirect blessings from the Dutch government. It emerged
on Friday that the Dutch cabinet approved the tax implications of the deal
in the summer after the country's tax authorities had initially balked at
Rabobank's plans to purchase the assets.
The deal means Rabobank is likely to pay less corporate tax this year than
would otherwise have been the case.
The Amsterdam stock exchange said it had not yet decided whether the
transaction was price-sensitive information which should have been reported
to investors.
Philips' shares did not react to news of the lease-back arrangement, closing
unchanged on Friday at Fl 36.20.
The transaction has received wide attention in the Netherlands, where it has
been interpreted as a gesture of government support for one of the country's
most important companies.
Philips, which is plagued by recession in the consumer electronics industry,
has been making a concerted drive to cut its working capital and boost its
cashflow. Until now, however, it has not publicly reported a lease-back
arrangement.
Earlier this year, Philips bolstered its balance sheet by selling its
minority stake in a semi-conductor joint venture to Matsushita of Japan,
generating a gain of Fl 1.1bn.

MR ALLAN GORMLY will next year step down as chief executive of Trafalgar
House when he is expected to take a more prominent role at Royal Insurance,
where he is a non-executive deputy chairman.
Trafalgar, the construction, engineering and shipping group, is planning to
announce the move in the next few weeks. Mr Gormly's departure is not
expected to take place until the middle of next year.
Mr Gormly will remain on Trafalgar's board and is likely to be succeeded by
Mr Nigel Rich, who retires as managing director of Jardine Matheson in March
1994. Mr Rich is expected to take an extended holiday before returning to
the UK.
Hongkong Land, controlled by Jardine Matheson and which has a 25.3 per cent
stake in Trafalgar, has tightened its control over the UK construction and
engineering group. Earlier this year Mr Simon Keswick was installed as
chairman and Mr David Gawler as financial director.
However, Trafalgar said yesterday that relations between Mr Gormly and the
Keswick family, who control Hongkong Land, remained very good.
Trafalgar's financial year ended on September 30 and the results, to be
announced on December 14, are expected to show a loss.
Mr Gormly is one of the last surviving board executives before Hongkong Land
took effective control at the end of last year. He was previously chairman
of the company's engineering division.

for motor and, to a lesser extent, home insurance.
Churchill, the Bromley-based motor insurer, has announced an injection of
some Pounds 6m by its Swiss owner, Winterthur, to allow it to continue
expansion.
The group insures more than 400,000 motorists and, according to chief
executive Mr Martin Long, aims to begin marketing home insurance policies
next month. The money is needed as rapid growth has put strain on the
capital base. Mr Long said Winterthur would make a further Pounds 5m in
capital available early next year, allowing the group to push ahead with
plans to insure some 550,000 motorists.
The Insurance Service, the Royal Insurance subsidiary based in Bristol, is
to set up a second regional service centre in Sunderland, paving the way for
an increase in business. TIS leases 36,000 sq ft of office and warehouse
space in Bristol. Its new building will give it an extra 34,500 sq ft.

<TEXT>
GARTMORE, the rapidly growing fund management group owned by France's Banque
Indosuez, is to appoint four independent non-executive directors, as it
prepares for flotation later this year.
The new non-executives are: Mr Victor Benjamin, the deputy chairman of
Tesco, the retailer; Mr Simon Duffy, group finance director of Thorn EMI,
the music and electronics group; Mr Nigel Rudd, the executive chairman of
Williams Holdings, the industrial conglomerate; and Mr James Watson,
chairman of NFC. the transport group.
Banque Indosuez will be represented on Gartmore's board by a further four
non-executive directors, including Mr Antoine Jeancourt-Galignani, the
Banque Indosuez chairman.
'The non-executive directors will not only provide Gartmore with a strong
independent range of opinion and a focused input to such management areas as
remuneration and audit, but will also make a substantial contribution to the
overall development of the group,' said Mr Paul Myners, executive chairman.

FT  11 OCT 93 / International Company News: Matthew Clark takes control of
own fortunes - Philip Rawstorne on the success of the group's three year
restructuring programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MATTHEW Clark, the drinks producer and wholesaler, got a solid vote of
confidence from the market at the weekend for its three year programme of
strategic restructuring.
Shares in the group jumped 25p to 523p - a reflection of investors'
satisfaction with its latest acquisition, the Pounds 32.5m purchase of
Grants of St James's from Allied-Lyons.
The fact that the move will be funded by Clark's second rights issue within
four months made the reaction even more remarkable.
But Grants adds tone as well as substance to the transformation of the group
by Mr Peter Aikens, chief executive. Since he began to reshape it in 1990,
the shares have outperformed the brewers and distillers sector by 50 per
cent.
In 1989, Clark was a leading independent drinks distributor. Well over half
its annual profits came from Martell cognac, which it had distributed in the
UK since 1833. Its portfolio included Jameson's Irish whiskey, Macallan malt
whisky, and Taittinger champagne.
The only brands Clark could call its own, through a 52 per cent stake in JE
Mather, the Leeds-based producer, were Stone's Original ginger wine, and Old
England British sherry.
Run on traditional lines by the Clark family, which had a shareholding of
about 17 per cent, the company was jogging along comfortably until the
ground was suddenly cut from under its feet.
Seagram took over Martell, Pernod-Ricard acquired Irish Distillers and Clark
had lost the distribution of its most profitable brands.
For another year, Clark struggled to fill the gap with other agency brands
such as Domecq sherry, Fundador brandy, and Grand Marnier liqueur. But the
loss of the Macallan Scotch whisky business after the 1990 alliance of Remy
Cointreau and Highland Distilleries confirmed the inherent uncertainty of
the agency business.
By then, Mr Aikens, recruited from Courage by Clark's non-executive
directors, was already beginning to devise a strategy for more solidly based
growth. Under his direction, the company began a gradual withdrawal from the
agency business to concentrate on its core British wine and sherry
operations.
British sherry may not appeal to connoisseurs - and will even have to stop
describing itself as sherry in 1995 - but it sells more readily than the
Spanish product. It now has more than 50 per cent of the UK sherry market
and sales are growing at more than 6 per cent a year.
In December 1990, Clark bought out the minority holders in Mather, Bass and
Grand Metropolitan's IDV spirits division, for Pounds 12m. The partnership
had been a constraint on Clark's development, effectively preventing it from
acquiring or producing new brands because of possible competition with Bass
and IDV products.
As the search for brand acquisitions got under way, Clark disposed in rapid
succession of three non-core businesses, almost recouping the money spent on
Mather.
A series of management changes followed. The Clark family reduced its
shareholding and retired from the scene. Mr Michael Cottrell, chairman of
Taunton Cider and former managing director of Courage, took the chair. Mr
Hugh Etheridge came from Strong &amp; Fisher as finance director and Mr Tim
Hazell, another ex-Courage executive, took over as sales and marketing
director. Mr Peter Huntley, a member of Elders IXL strategy group, was
appointed business development director.
With the arrival last month of Mr Robin Manners, former Bass director, as a
non-executive, only one member of the pre-1990 board, Mr Tony Grayson,
production director, now remains.
Clark took longer than expected to make its first brand acquisition but
organic growth in its British sherry and wines operations came up to market
expectations in spite of the recession and the squeeze on margins by its
main customers, the multiple grocers.
An attempt in late 1991 to acquire Allied-Lyons's Showerings business, with
brands such as Gaymer's cider, Babycham, and VP wine, failed. A number of
other approaches came to nothing.
In May last year, however, it bought Strathmore, Scotland's leading bottled
water brand, for Pounds 11m. The purchase took Clark into another growth
sector.
The brand had gained a 25 per cent share of the bottled water market in the
Scottish grocery sector in six years and was beginning to expand into
England. Sales through Clark's distribution network are now growing at the
rate of 20 per cent a year.
Earlier this year, Mr Aikens moved into another cash generative growth area
with the Pounds 18.6m acquisition of 74.9 per cent of Freetraders, an
independent drinks wholesaler.
The business, which reported a 45 per cent increase in sales and operating
profits of Pounds 2.3m last year, neatly complements Clark's existing
strengths in the take-home trade.
Even before the addition of Grants' wines and spirits business, Mr Aikens
expects the operation to be contributing 40 per cent of Clark's profits
within the next six months.
In the three years of strategic restructuring, Matthew Clark has taken
control of its own fortunes and increased its market capitalisation from
Pounds 26m to Pounds 74m.

FT  11 OCT 93 / International Company News: Coutts Consulting deal raises
dividend hopes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
COUTTS Consulting Group, the career consultancy, outplacement and
residential training company, has sidestepped objections by Mr Barry Topple,
its former chief executive, and found a way of eliminating the deficit on
its share premium account allowing dividends to be paid.
Coutts hoped that as a result Mr Topple's compensation claim and their
counter-claim for Pounds 3.4m damages would now reach a rapid conclusion.
Eynsham Hall, Coutts' residential training offshoot, is acquiring Coutts
Consultants, its outplacement business. The move releases merger reserves of
Pounds 4.1m as well as showing a book profit of Pounds 2.9m. There are still
arrears of Pounds 600,000 on the preference shares.
The deal completes the reorganisation at Coutts Consulting, formerly DC
Gardner.
A previous attempt to reduce the share premium account had been blocked by
Mr Topple.
Mr Tim Inglefield, finance director, said the company would have preferred
to achieve the result in front of the shareholders by going through the
courts, but this had not been possible.

FT  11 OCT 93 / International Company News: Institutions optimistic on
prospects and equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MAJORITY of institutional investors believe the UK equities market to be
the most attractive investment prospect on a 12 month view over other
markets, and many remain confident about prospects for the UK economy,
according to a survey published today.
The monthly Smith New Court/Gallup survey of fund managers reveals that a
balance of 77 per cent of institutions (the difference between those
institutions that are positive and those that are negative) remain bullish
on UK equities over the next 12 months; against a balance of 56 per cent in
favour other European markets; 50 per cent positive on the Japanese market
and a mere 4 per cent that favour the US market.
A balance of 22 per cent of those polled plan to increase their holdings of
UK equities this month, up sharply from 7 per cent the previous month, with
56 per cent favouring the FT-SE 250 stocks while 37 per cent prefer to limit
investments to the FT-SE 100.
Overall, institutions continue to be optimistic about economic recovery and
inflation, and many continue to expect a cut in interest rates.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Auditors turn cold as legal claims hot up: Record pay-outs
have led to pressure to limit accountants' liability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rising tide of multi-million pound claims against auditors is 'enough to
turn the blood cold', according to the senior partner of one large British
firm.
Last week's Dollars 110m (Pounds 73m) out of court settlement in Dublin
ended what could have become a marathon legal action between Ernst &amp;
Whinney, the accountants, and Allied Irish Banks. But the size of the
pay-out is an uncomfortable reminder for accountants of the scale of the
risks to which their profession is exposed.
Increasingly, accountants are facing a steady rise in legal exposures, as
creditors and investors in troubled and insolvent companies seek to recover
losses.
The Dublin case arose as a result of the failure of Insurance Corporation of
Ireland, a small general insurance company acquired by Allied in 1983. Ernst
&amp; Whinney, now part of Ernst &amp; Young, audited Insurance Corp's books between
1978 and 1983, a time when it was growing quickly. However, Insurance Corp
set aside insufficient cash to meet future claims and in 1985 collapsed with
losses of more than IPounds 80m (Pounds 76m). Allied, together with the
company's administrators, Icarom, launched legal action, claiming Dollars
550m, alleging that E&amp;Y had not looked hard enough at Insurance Corp's
operations. With accumulated interest the size of the claim could have
exceeded IPounds 1bn. E&amp;Y did not admit liability and took comfort in the
fact that the settlement was equal to only about 8 per cent of this.
For E&amp;Y it follows hard on the heels of some big pay-outs in the US. Last
November's Dollars 400m settlement with US federal savings and loan industry
regulators, was the largest ever agreed by an accountancy firm. Ernst &amp;
Whinney is also named - along with Price Waterhouse - on a Dollars 8bn
claim, filed by the liquidators of the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International (BCCI).
Mr Lawrence A. Weinbach, managing partner-chief executive of the Arthur
Andersen Worldwide Organisation, estimates that worldwide the industry faces
Dollars 30bn of claims.
This puts pressure on the arrangements through which the 'big six' insure
themselves. The largest accountancy firms rely on both the conventional
professional indemnity insurance market and the industry's own mutual
insurers - Bermuda-based PALE and PADUA.
Cover provided from these sources is understood to extend to more than
Dollars 100m. But it is limited. And beyond a certain level the partners
themselves - as the owners of the firms - are individually liable up to the
total value of their assets.
Premiums have risen steeply - by at least 300 per cent since 1985 - and
insurers have increased the amount of each claim that they pay from their
own resources. In 1992 the costs of fighting legal action for the 'big six'
in the US amounted to Dollars 598m - or 11 per cent of their revenues.
Insurance recoveries provided an additional Dollars 185m in resolving
claims, says Mr Weinbach.
Many smaller and medium-sized firms are also coming under fire. Mr Charles
Cox, of CT Bowring, the insurance broker which provides a scheme for the
smaller UK groups, says that each year one in five accountants notify their
insurers about circumstances which might give rise to a claim. 'There has
been a steady increase in notifications and a steady deterioration in
claims.'
Roughly half of all claims dealt with by Bowring are linked to tax disputes,
but the number of audit claims now amounts to one in four of all claims.
In the US, Mr Weinbach says the fear of legal action and potential financial
ruin is leading to fewer accountants entering the profession and many
younger accountants are refusing the offer of partnership. Over-exposure to
litigation was a big factor in the 1990 bankruptcy of Laventhol Horwath,
then the seventh-largest accounting firm in the US.
Europe has yet to reach this pitch. Even so Mr Richard Murray, chief
executive of Minet Global Professional Services, says claims here are rising
at a faster rate than in any other part of the world. With many of the cases
in the UK, the pressure for reforms to limit liabilities seems certain to
grow.
Accountants are seeking changes to the Companies Act which now bans auditors
making contracts where liability with clients is limited. Mr John Magill,
who is responsible for risk management at Touche Ross, said: 'There is
concern that we can just be blown out of the water by some of these
settlements.'

FT  11 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Greycoat seeks time from creditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREYCOAT, the property company whose future is in doubt after share and
bondholders last Friday rejected a rescue bid from Postel, faces a crucial
test today if it is to keep creditors at bay.
The company and NM Rothschild, its advisers, will this morning ask the Law
Debenture Trust, trustees for holders of Greycoat's zero coupon bonds, for
more time to find a way to avoid being put into default.
If the trustees choose not to waive their rights to issue default notices,
Greycoat's bankers are likely to take control of their security and the
company would go into receivership.
Greycoat's advisers expect to be granted a 30-day extension to find a way to
reduce the company's high gearing that triggered the default on the zero
coupon bonds.
NM Rothschild and Greycoat would then have 'a fortnight to get something
creative going', an adviser said.
If no new rescue plan or bid emerged Greycoat's directors would be in danger
of becoming personally accountable for allowing an insolvent company to
continue trading.
After the rejection last week of Postel's Pounds 120m rescue bid, one
observer described the hush over the weekend as 'something of phoney war'.
Since Postel announced its package, two blocks have emerged of share and
bondholders who have a significant interest in a rescue being patched
together.
The UK Active Value Fund, advised by corporate financiers, Mr Brian Myerson
and Mr Julian Treger, owns 18 per cent of the ordinary shares; while Gruss
Partners, of the US, and Goldman Sachs hold 14 per cent and 8 per cent
respectively of the preference shares.
Greycoat will only avoid default on its zero coupon bonds in one of two
ways. Either it will devise a more conventional restructuring with its
shareholders and bondholders that would include a rights issue.
A Rothschild adviser said yesterday 'there had been some conversations since
the poll (of share and bondholders on Friday) but it is still early days'.
Alternatively, a third party could make a bid for the company. Rothschild
said yesterday it had not received any bids.

FT  11 OCT 93 / UK utilities aim for expansion overseas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, ROBERT CORZINE, BRONWEN MADDOX and ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK'S 18 privatised electricity companies are likely to invest at least
Pounds 1.5bn abroad in the next five years, as part of expansion plans to
escape constraints on their profitability imposed by their regulators.
Although little more than Pounds 200m has been committed so far by the
electricity companies they have plans for projects in the US, Portugal and
Germany.
The electricity, water and gas companies are following the lead of BT, the
telecommunications group which was privatised in 1984. Its international
plans, which have met with mixed success, culminated in June with its Pounds
2.88bn purchase of a 20 per cent stake in MCI, the US long-distance carrier.
However, the international push by the former nationalised corporations may
raise doubts about their ability to manage overseas operations and prompt
calls for tighter regulation of their international activities.
Ofgas, the gas regulator, wants British Gas's international operations
included in its remit. Ofwat the water industry regulator, commenting on the
water companies' expansion abroad, said: 'We have been doing a lot of work
to prevent cross-subsidisation - money from customers' bills being used to
finance this expansion.'
The electricity companies' move is being led by National Power which expects
to invest up to Pounds 1bn overseas by the year 2000 in projects valued up
to Pounds 15bn. It recently spent Dollars 160m on Tevco, which owns power
plants in the south-east of the US. It expects between 10 and 20 per cent of
its earnings could be generated abroad by the year 2000.
The National Grid, which operates the transmission system in England and
Wales, plans to invest up to Pounds 370m overseas in the next five years. It
has already spent Pounds 23m as one of a consortium which has taken over the
Argentinian transmission system.
Midland Electricity has indicated to the City that it is prepared to commit
up to Pounds 200m in overseas investments.
International expansion is a large component in British Gas's plans, in the
light of commercial and legal challenges to its dominance of the UK market.
Since privatisation in 1986 British Gas has spent more than Pounds 1.1bn on
foreign exploration and production assets.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Hoechst bids for stake in US generic drugs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOECHST, the troubled German chemicals group, is bidding for its first stake
in the North American generic drugs market with a Dollars 550m (Pounds 364m)
offer for 51 per cent of the Copley group of the US.
Copley, which last year earned Dollars 12.3m after taxes on sales of Dollars
52m, is an important opening for the bidder's Hoechst Roussel Pharmaceutical
Industries subsidiary, which last year reported sales of Dollars 600m in the
US and claimed a 1.1 per cent market share. The share of generics -
out-of-patent products - in the US prescription drugs market is expected to
grow 14 per cent a year until the end of the century, according to Hoechst.
It based its forecast on planned US health reforms, aimed at improving
treatment for 36m Americans not covered by health insurance, partly by
increased use of cheaper generic drugs.
The move is also a further step in restructuring at Hoechst, which suffered
a 31 per cent decline in profits in the first half of this year. At the end
of May the group said it was to sell a majority stake in its viscose and
acrylic fibres operations to Courtaulds of the UK.
If the deal is concluded, Copley will take over the manufacture and
distribution of Hoechst Roussel products as their patents expire, the German
group said. Hoechst, which has no generics business in Germany, said the
first drug affected would be a treatment for diabetes.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Eonomics Notebook: Two examples of pomp and circumstance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two countries, two central banks, and each with new men at the top.
Ten days ago, Mr Hans Tietmeyer was installed as Bundesbank president in the
nearest thing to a coronation that the Federal Republic has to offer. The
handover of power at the Bundesbank was marked by a ceremony attended by 800
guests from European central banks and German government, politics and
business. Among the seven speeches (punctuated by passages from a Schumann
piano quintet and Beethoven's trio for clarinet, cello and piano) was one by
Chancellor Helmut Kohl declaring his support for Bundesbank independence.
Three months earlier, on July 1, Mr Eddie George took over as the new
governor of the Bank of England and Mr Rupert Pennant Rea, the former editor
of the Economist, as his deputy. Mr George travelled into Threadneedle
Street from his Dulwich home as on any normal working day. Mr Pennant-Rea
moved into a new office. Otherwise, there was no change in the Bank's
long-established routine.
At first sight, the Bank of England's approach to the change in its top
management was reassuringly low key. It seemed to express the very British
idea of 'business as usual'. But the pomp surrounding the elevation of Mr
Tietmeyer to the presidency of the Bundesbank was more than Teutonic self
indulgence.
The gathering in Frankfurt's elegant Palmengarten marked out Mr Tietmeyer as
one of Europe's most powerful men. It also was an act of homage by Germany's
political class to the Bundesbank as an institution, and a reminder that the
person who happened to be at its top was merely a steward.
In a world of rapid economic, social and political change, there is a
growing interest among policymakers in building and nurturing institutions
to support economic policy goals.
The absence of strong economic policymaking institutions is keenly felt in
Russia. The existence of a central bank that saw control of inflation and
monetary conditions as its vocation would have made a huge difference to the
process of transformation from a command to a market economy.
Israeli policymakers are conscious that Gaza and the region around Jericho
will need more than money if they are to have effective self government. In
a recent conversation, Mr Jacob Frenkel, the governor of the Central Bank of
Israel, underlined the vital need for the Palestinians to set up effective
institutions for controlling public spending and managing taxation in the
areas that they will govern. Otherwise, the territories could become
dependent on outside aid.
In Britain, institutions such as the Bank of England, the Stock Exchange and
the Treasury have seen their influence slip over the past decade in the face
of the growing power of financial markets. Perhaps because the British
establishment has generally made a mess of running the economy over the past
40 years, the pendulum has yet to swing back in favour of building these
institutions up again.
But there is a case for having a thorough look at the current state and
objectives of the Bank of England.
The Bank's present position is the result of a typically messy British
compromise. It has, since Britain's exit from the European exchange rate
mechanism, been given more explicit responsibility for the control of
inflation. Although both Messrs George and Pennant-Rea would like more
autonomy, it is nowhere near having the independence that would make it
responsible for price stability.
When Mr George was named as governor in January he was given a mandate 'to
support the government in its determination to bring about a lasting
reduction in the rate of inflation'.
Shortly before, the government had set as a target a 1 to 4 per cent range
for the underlying rate of inflation (retail price inflation minus mortgage
interest payments) during the life of this parliament.
Since July's change at the top, the Bank seems determined to create as much
freedom of manoeuvre as it can.
It seems to have won a battle to prevent the Treasury interfering with the
writing of its quarterly inflation report. This document, introduced in
February, is intended to provide an independent signal if inflation is
threatening to burst through its target ceiling.
Last week, Mr Pennant-Rea unilaterally redefined the government's inflation
target to 1 to 2.5 per cent by 1996 or 1997 in place of the previous vague
statement by Mr Norman Lamont when chancellor that 'by the end of the
Parliament we need to be in the lower part of the (1-4 per cent) range'.
The present chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, seems happy to let the Bank flex
its muscles. In an interview with Crossbow, the magazine of the Tory Bow
Group last week, he said the Treasury would no longer have a hand in the
Bank's inflation report. He also promised not to tamper with monetary policy
for political ends. 'It is important that monetary policy is taken
objectively, openly and is certainly not buffeted about by short-term
political considerations to assist the party in power,' he said.
But although the chancellor said he had a 'fairly open mind' on the subject
of Bank independence, there was nothing to suggest that he wanted to give up
ultimate responsibility for the Bank and monetary policy. Mr Clarke believes
strongly in the Westminster parliamentary system. 'I think people would get
fed up with me telling parliament that the most important features of
economic policy were practically beyond my control,' he told Crossbow.
But Mr Clarke's word will not be the last on the issue. The House of Commons
Treasury and Civil Service Committee has been holding hearings on the Bank's
future. Its report, expected either late this year or early in 1994, could
boost pressure for greater Bank independence.
The Bank itself will be celebrating its tercentenary next summer and has
commissioned an opera for the occasion. It is unlikely to symbolise the
power of the institution in the way that this month's ceremony in Frankfurt
buttressed the Bundesbank.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Socialists returned to power in Greek election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GREECE'S veteran socialist leader, Mr Andreas Papandreou, made a remarkable
political comeback last night when his party triumphed in the country's
general election after four years in opposition.
Looking frail, the 74-year-old socialist pledged a foreign policy that would
restore Greece's authority and an economic policy that would ensure
'stability, growth and social protection'.
Mr Papandreou lost power in 1989 dogged by ill health and controversy. His
health allowed him to make few appearances in the latest election campaign
and his victory statement on television was made from behind his desk at his
home in Athens.
With just over half the votes counted, his Panhellenic Socialist Movement
(Pasok) led with 46.4 per cent, compared with just 40.6 per cent for the
conservative New Democracy party of Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis.
Computer projections indicated that Pasok would finish with almost 47 per
cent of the vote and New Democracy with about 40 per cent.
That would give the socialists a clear majority with 169 seats in the
300-member parliament under an electoral law that awards extra seats to the
front-running party.
Political Spring, a conservative splinter group founded three months ago by
Mr Antonis Samaras, a former foreign minister, was in third place with 4.8
per cent of the votes.
The only other party to be represented in parliament will be the hardline
Communist party, which was set to win 4.3 per cent of the vote.
New Democracy appeared to have lost most support to Political Spring, which
forced the election six months early by persuading two conservative deputies
to defect.
Mr Mitsotakis, conceding defeat, said he was resigning the New Democracy
leadership. 'New Democracy followed the correct path,' he said. 'It took
painful but necessary decisions and it paid the political cost.'
The conservatives' popularity was hit by efforts to restructure the economy,
including a public sector wage freeze, closures of loss-making state
enterprises and a failed attempt to privatise utilities.
Voters appeared to have cast aside doubts that Mr Papandreou may not be
strong enough to run the country. He has proved an unexpected political
survivor, despite leading a secluded life since undergoing heart surgery
while prime minister in 1988. He has shrugged off controversy surrounding
his marriage. His recovery dates from his acquittal last year on financial
corruption charges.

FT  11 OCT 93 / European airlines agree size of stakes in planned alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FOUR European national airlines planning to create an alliance to
challenge British Airways and Lufthansa have agreed the controversial
question of how to value their stakes in the partnership.
The negotiations, which could eventually lead to a full merger between
Swissair, Scandinavian Airlines System, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and
Austrian Airlines will come to a head at a meeting in Zurich tomorrow.
Agreement on the complex valuation issue gives an important boost to the
negotiations, confirming the four airlines' commitment to the pact.
Under the proposed Alcazar alliance, Swissair, SAS and KLM would each own 30
per cent of the new centralised management company and Austrian 10 per cent.
The airlines agreed the split could not be achieved without adjustments to
reflect the relative worth of each airline.
The Swiss argued their carrier's valuation should be higher it was not as
highly geared as SAS or KLM. But SAS and KLM argued that Swissair faced a
less promising long-term future because it had been losing market share in
Europe, was not a European Community carrier and had higher labour costs.
The partners are thought to have agreed that Swissair's share of the joint
company should be 35-36 per cent, about Dollars 250m-Dollars 350m more than
the other airlines. To close the gap KLM and SAS would increase their worth
by increasing their equity, while Swissair would reduce its valuation by
paying a special dividend to its shareholders.
Austrian Airlines is still wavering between the Alcazar partnership or
co-operating with Lufthansa. The airline's management is understood to
favour Alcazar, but its majority shareholder, the Austrian state, is
undecided and appears to be leaning towards the German carrier.
However, the three larger partners would proceed even if Austrian pulled
out, sources close to the negotiations said.
Even if agreement is reached on Tuesday, the four airlines still have
difficult issues to resolve, including the structure of the new centralised
management company, the location of its headquarters and the selection of a
US airline partner.
The choice of the headquarters appears to have been narrowed down to either
Amsterdam or Copenhagen. But the choice of a US partner could prove
difficult since Swissair has links with Delta Air Lines, KLM with Northwest
Airlines and SAS with Continental Airlines.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Snacks play byte-size role in computer games: New
advertising ploy sparks call for regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHILDREN'S computer games are the latest, and apparently highly effective,
advertising medium for snack food manufacturers seeking to promote their
brands.
Sweets, biscuits and crisps, and the logos and advertising characters
associated with them, are appearing as integral parts of the computer games.
For Pounds 13,000, a manufacturer is able to buy a 'standard inclusion'
consisting of a 20-second animation sequence at the beginning of the game.
An outlay of Pounds 50,000 would secure inclusion in one of the 10
top-selling games and an entire level of the game would probably be built
around the product, according to Mr Daniel Bobroff, the 28-year-old
executive who says he created the market.
However, there is sometimes little or no indication on the packaging that
games have been sponsored by food manufacturers in this largely unregulated
advertising sector.
The Consumers' Association is calling for the British Code of Advertising
Practice to be extended to new media developments, including electronic
games.
Mr Bobroff's company, Microtime Media, which he says has an annual turnover
of Pounds 1m, says his latest deal is a tie-up between The Sun newspaper,
Domino's Pizza delivery chain and Fizzy Chewits sweets, for a game with a
Sun photographer as its hero.
Level one of Snapperazzi, which is due on sale at Christmas, features Page
Three girls (their weapons are kisses); level two is rock stars; and level
three has the Royal family firing corgis, said Mr Bobroff.
It is 'too early to say' whether the packaging will make it clear that
pizzas and sweets are also featured in the game, he added.
Quavers crisps, and the character associated with the brand, Colin Curly,
appear in the computer game One Step Beyond. Penguin biscuits feature in
James Pond 2, while Chupa Chups, the Spanish lolly, is an integral part of
the game Zool.
Research conducted for Microtime Media by Carrick James Market Research is
said to show that 87 per cent of youngsters aged from five to 19 in the UK
regularly play computer games, while 76 per cent have a games console or
personal computer in their home.
However, awareness among parents of the advertising may not be as high. For
example, the version of Zool on sale this weekend in the games department of
Virgin Megastore in London's Oxford Street makes no mention on its packaging
of the Chupa Chups advertising.
McVities, which makes Penguin, said involvement with the computer game was
'a one-off tactical promotion. We were offered advertising slots with the
game and costs were minimal.'
Mr Bobroff said software publishers had been reluctant to feature prominent
mentions of advertisers on packaging. However, all future productions would
say they were 'produced in association with' or 'sponsored by' the brand
advertising.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Report questions charities' automatic right to tax relief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHARITIES should lose their automatic right to tax relief, according to a
Home Office sponsored report due to be published tomorrow which is spreading
alarm through the voluntary sector.
The report will conclude that charity is a medieval concept that has become
meaningless now that many voluntary organisations provide welfare services
under contract to public authorities.
It will argue that charities must choose between becoming publicly funded
agencies delivering services or free-standing campaigning organisations.
Under the proposals, charities operating public contracts might receive tax
refunds if they met annual performance targets, rather than guaranteed tax
relief because of their charitable status.
Although the report does not represent government policy, its research was
directed by three former advisers to the Home Office Voluntary Services
Unit. The Home Office, in addition to publishing the report, helped to
finance it, and other funders include the Scottish Office and the Northern
Ireland Office.
The report is based on one of the most extensive research studies of
Britain's voluntary sector since Beveridge's famous work on the welfare
state in 1948.
Voluntary sector leaders who have seen advance copies fear the report will
immediately acquire semi-official status. Campaigns against its proposals
are being planned even before publication.
In recent years, charities have been encouraged by the government to take on
a growing range of welfare services previously provided by the public
sector. Some charity directors have been concerned that this could create
ambiguity over the real purpose of charity. The report, by arguing in effect
that charities must decide whether to become state-financed agencies, will
help bring these issues to a head.
An initiative to create greater cohesion between non-profit organisations
will be launched at a forum for the social economy in London tomorrow.
Sir Dennis Landau, chairman of Unity Trust Bank, who is responsible for the
initiative, said: 'We are seeing the rise of credit unions, housing
associations and trust hospitals; trade unions becoming service providers to
their members; charities supplying services for local authorities. The
common thread is the growth in service providers which fall outside the
public and private sectors.'

FT  11 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Rhone-Poulenc
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Of all the candidates in France's privatisation programme, Rhone-Poulenc,
which is slated to follow BNP, must crave the freedom of the private sector.
The company's transformation into a pharmaceuticals giant would have been
difficult to achieve without government support. Yet access to equity has
become a serious headache. The FFr14bn preference shares and other
quasi-equity instruments which prop up the company's balance sheet could
usefully be replaced with real equity. That will doubtless be near the top
of the company's agenda once privatisation is out of the way.
The weight of debt cuts both ways. Ordinary shareholders are heavily geared
to any cyclical recovery in profits, but interest charges and the cost of
servicing preference capital will take a large slice out of profits until
the upturn comes. The worry is that the downturn consistently caught
Rhone-Poulenc unawares. At the time of January's partial privatisation offer
 -which bought the government's direct holding down to 43 per cent - the
company was anticipating profits growth this year. The 11 per cent decline
in first half net profits would have been worse but for a change in
depreciation policy.
Cyclical recovery in chemicals is the big prize, but it is still some way
off. There is also the touchy question of healthcare reform in France, which
accounts for a quarter of the company's pharmaceuticals sales. While the
issue is unlikely to be addressed until after privatisation, it seems too
much to hope that reform will leave Rhone-Poulenc untouched.

<TEXT>
The Chancellor has some hard political choices to make if he intends to
raise extra revenue in his November budget. But one of the softest options -
judging by the cheers at the Conservative Party conference, at least - would
be to slap VAT on newspapers. Recent cover price cuts by the Sun and the
Times may be viewed in Number 11 as an open invitation for such a move.
Given the political flak that would fly however much he taxed newspapers, Mr
Clarke may choose to apply VAT at the full rate to raise a decent amount of
revenue.
That would undoubtedly come as a savage blow to the newspaper industry.
Publishers would face the painful dilemma of deciding whether to pass on the
increase and lose circulation or swallow the rise at the expense of margin.
Against the background of sluggish advertising and rising newsprint costs,
many newspaper groups would face a particularly rough time. National
newspaper titles with strong franchises would be comparatively well placed
to endure the pain. But the move would have a long term impact, depressing
the prospects for any subsequent price rises.
Local newspapers and magazines may prove far less robust, however. With
somewhat spurious precision, the Newspaper Society suggests 245 regional
newspapers would close. The Periodical Publishers Association estimates that
25 per cent of magazine titles would shut. But, theoretically, those that
survived the shake-out could prosper.

FT  11 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: British Gas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission produced a cogent and coherent view of
the future of the gas industry when it proposed splitting up British Gas.
Yet it must be questionable whether the academic purity of the MMC's view
will survive the political realities of the government's needs. The main
thrust of the MMC's view - that sustainable competition in the domestic gas
market required British Gas to be broken up - runs counter to the
government's thoughts. So far, the Department of Trade and Industry has
encouraged competition by the simple expedient of allowing entrants in.
British Gas has argued, however, that safety considerations prevent the
rapid further opening of the domestic gas market. Both the DTI and the MMC
are, at least, agreed that competition cannot be extended and British Gas
broken up at the same time. It may be tempting for the DTI to avoid break-up
if it is keen on more competition.
Yet that course is equally fraught with difficulty. Rapid deregulation would
lead to differential pricing between users. Then there is the question of
who should pay for the extra overheads and meters needed in a competitive
market. The MMC recommended that customers should bear the costs, since they
were the ultimate beneficiaries. Both would be politically embarrassing for
the government at the time when VAT is being applied to fuel. The government
might suggest introducing domestic competition conveniently after the next
election. But that would leave British Gas still bound hip and thigh to its
beloved regulator.

FT  11 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: A sound constitution
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At least France will not be able to blame Anglo-Saxon speculators if
Germany's constitutional court comes out against the Maastricht Treaty
tomorrow. The ruling is one of those awkward instances where financial
markets have to rely on guesswork to predict what will happen. A decision
that Maastricht is unconstitutional or that ratification requires a
referendum would deal a body blow to any lingering hopes of European
monetary union. That could cause a fresh surge of demand for D-marks with,
at the other extreme, a sharp sell-off in the Ecu bond market. Insofar as
any outcome can be discounted in advance, though, the expectation is that
the court will give the Treaty a qualified approval.
The trick will be to decide how serious any qualifications might be.
Anything that necessitates renegotiation of the Treaty would be as awkward
as an outright no. Some qualifications could turn out less innocuous than
they sound. For example, the court could limit the scope for changing the
economic convergence criteria, even though the EC Commission might deem
change necessary to maintain the progress towards monetary union.
Since the ERM was forced to scrap its narrow bands at the start of August,
few people have much faith in monetary union arriving on target anyway. That
may limit the market's response, especially since the D-Mark has already
advanced on Friday's disappointing US unemployment figures. But a further
setback for monetary union would see those gains consolidated. The question
then will be whether the Bundesbank will respond by accelerating its
interest rate cuts.

Observer has already raised an eyebrow at the apparent ease with which
Nigeria secured an invitation to the biennial gathering of Commonwealth
members in a year when the African state has ignored the outcome of a
presidential election and kept the soldiers in power. Now Chief Ernest
Shonekan, the former businessman who fronts for the military as head of
state, seems to be pushing his luck still further.
Commonwealth officials are appalled to learn that the chief plans to
surround himself at next week's conference in Cyprus with an entourage
numbering no less than 60. This is four or five times as many people as John
Major will be taking; such a clutch would of course also vastly outnumber
the Queen's party, an organiser points out.
So it is being gently suggested that Shonekan might make do with fewer.
After all, a country seeking backing for its efforts to reschedule Dollars
34bn in external debt should perhaps be seen to be cutting back a bit on
outings for the boys.

Nicknamed the Prince of Darkness during his eight-year stint in the
government whips' office, Tristan Garel-Jones ought to get on well with Sir
Robert 'Black Bob' Scholey whom he joins as one of a clutch of advisers to
Union Bank of Switzerland's London operation.
The global UBS environment ought to suit Euro-crazy Garel-Jones, the fluent
Spanish-speaking ex-foreign office minister who turned down two or three
other City offers to link hands with the Swiss.
The services of the erstwhile arch-plotter of Westminster would, of course,
have come in handy last year when UBS was rife with intrigue after the
sacking of the former head of UK equity research, Terry Smith.
When not out on the road selling UBS's services, might Garel-Jones now
employ his legendary powers scheming to install Rudi Mueller, the tough
Swiss head of UBS's London operation, as the next chairman of the London
Stock Exchange when Sir Andrew Hugh Smith steps down?

FT  11 OCT 93 / Observer: Holmes plays hard to get
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rather odd that Sir Peter Holmes, recently retired as chairman of Shell
Transport and Trading, should have accepted as his first non-executive
directorship in the UK a position on the board of headhunters Norman
Broadbent.
It would seem that Miles Broadbent had been sounding Holmes out for one
juicy job or another, only to discover that his lunch companion was more
amenable to joining his own stable.
Shortly off for a spot of fishing in Montana before indulging his passion
for the outdoors in other obscure corners of the world, Holmes says he is
'demobbed and loving the freedom'. So far he has also agreed to go on the
board of a Los Angeles global investment fund, but that is it.
The man who has been tipped as anything from the next chairman of British
Gas to president of the CBI concedes he 'might think again' at some point.
Only institutions that are 'leaders in their field' need apply.
A Shell recruiter himself in the early 1960s, he is convinced headhunters
perform a useful function - though Shell, of course, was far too proud of
its in-house man management abilities to look for outside help in filling
anything but the most specialised of jobs.
Miles Broadbent, who headhunted Colin Marshall (now Sir Colin) to British
Airways, already has Lord King aboard, as well as BICC ex-chairman Sir
William Barlow. The latter has become so fired up with the business that he
turns up regularly at internal management meetings.
But those who hold headhunters in the affection normally reserved for
traffic wardens and estate agents are still inclined to question why Holmes
chose to christen his UK portfolio with a job that looks to be rather a
whimsical hobby horse.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Unbending steel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FURTHER breakdown of talks on the multilateral steel agreement (MSA) in
Geneva last Friday may not have been wholly surprising, but it is
dispiriting all the same. The issue's importance goes far beyond the steel
industry. Until the MSA is settled, there can be no agreement on steel
tariffs under the GATT: and until steel tariffs are settled there can be no
conclusion to the Uruguay Round, due by the end of this year.
The sticking point last week seems to have been the same as before. Although
30 countries are involved, the nub of the argument concerns the US and the
EC. The US negotiators condemn EC subsidies; the EC negotiators rail against
US tariffs. It is inconceivable that either tariffs or subsidies could be
abolished, by the end of the year at any rate. US companies are entitled to
protection under US anti-dumping legislation. EC voters will not accept
massive steel closures without subsidies to ease the pain.
The EC steel crisis is at the root of the difficulty in more ways than one.
Mr Karel van Miert, the EC's competition commissioner, has to perform the
usual Brussels juggling act between the competing claims of member states
while at the same time staying within the EC rules on subsidies and state
aids. On top of all that, he has to ask himself whether the result will
satisfy the negotiators around the MSA table. It seems a lot to expect by
Christmas.
Perhaps the situation looks unduly gloomy in a European perspective. There
is a view in Washington which says that agreement was scarcely to be
expected this far away from the deadline: wait till next month, and it will
be another matter. In any case, runs this argument, the Clinton
administration has in recent weeks spent as much time listening to US steel
users, who are naturally opposed to tariffs, as it has to producers. If Mr
Clinton is turning his back on big steel, this certainly represents a break
with tradition. This is also an administration which believes in industrial
policy, at least by comparison with its two predecessors. It is therefore
more likely to see eye to eye with Brussels on matters of ideology.
If this proves the case, well and good. It is worth considering what steps
to take if it does not. Somehow or other, the GATT negotiators seem to have
got themselves into a position in which momentous issues of world trade
cannot be agreed in principle until the details of one particular commodity
have been hammered out in practice. This seems a peculiarly perverse
mismatch, given that the commodity in question is beset by difficulties
caused not merely by the world recession but by the fall of the Berlin Wall.
It would plainly be preferable for the MSA to be agreed by the year end. If
it cannot, it would be sensible for the GATT negotiators to be pragmatic.
Fix the outlines of a steel tariff agreement, settle the Uruguay Round, and
tidy up the details later.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Cutting red tape
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL HAMILTON, the minister in charge of the UK government's deregulation
initiative, made a fine knock-about speech at last week's Conservative party
conference. At one point, he produced a print-out several feet long listing
3,500 regulations burdening business and ripped it to pieces. Unfortunately,
hacking back the jungle of red tape will not be as easy as tearing up a
piece of paper in front of the party faithful. Everybody applauds the idea
of cutting red tape in theory. But when it comes to repealing specific
rules, enthusiasm can rapidly turn to hostility.
The snag is that one person's regulation is another's protection. Rules are
used to protect workers' jobs, consumers' health, investors' wealth and even
big businesses from competition. Regulation can also be attractive to the
Treasury as an alternative to public expenditure. Given the vested interests
stacked up against an assault on red tape, it is not surprising that many
observers believe the initiative will run out of steam.
The prognosis is probably not so dire. A deregulation bill, to be introduced
in the autumn with strong backing from Mr John Major, will subject every
regulation to a cost-compliance test. Given that form-filling and the like
is estimated to cost business 2-3 per cent of GDP, calculating
administrative costs could get legislators to think twice before
legislating. Ideally, some estimate of the overall economic costs should be
attempted as well. Regulation can prevent managers from devising the most
efficient methods of running their businesses, which is even more expensive
than the crude compliance costs.
But other tools are also needed for an effective campaign. One could be to
adopt the US practice of 'sunset' regulation, where rules automatically
expire after a certain date unless legislators make a conscious decision to
renew them. Another could be to spell out the way that regulation can be
counter-productive. For example, it seems likely that railway safety rules
have so added to fares that passengers have switched to cars - a much more
dangerous method of travel.
The really radical approach would be to adopt a new philosophy to
regulation. Government should set out general regulatory objectives instead
of specifying detailed ways of achieving those objectives. Such an approach
would, for example, allow a mass of detailed health and safety rules to be
replaced by more generally-defined duties on employers to take care of
workers' health. The incentive to do so would be the threat of large
damages.
Mr Hamilton will win easy plaudits by repealing a few dotty rules such as
that requiring people baking cakes at home for charities to have two
separate sinks. But the danger is that ministers will be content with such a
piecemeal approach, while leaving the bulk of regulations untouched. If that
happens, the conference boasts will come to nothing.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Priorities for EC growth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THEIR WEEKEND gathering in Belgium, most European Community finance
ministers had two purposes uppermost in mind. The first was to show the
Community is still somehow on track for economic and monetary union by the
end of the decade, despite the emergency widening of currency fluctuation
bands in August.
The second was to develop a strategy for economic recovery, without which
any plan for improved monetary co-ordination - let alone the much more
ambitious target of irreversibly fixed exchange rates - will founder.
The ministers are a long way from accomplishing either objective. But by
apparently placing greater emphasis on the second aim rather than the first,
they seem to be drawing sensible conclusions from the crisis in the exchange
rate mechanism.
Ministers stressed the need to restore convergence of recession-hit EC
economies, but rejected rigid targets for a return to greater exchange rate
stability. This order of priorities is a necessary - but not sufficient -
condition for eventual resumption of the annual 3 per cent growth rates
needed to bring down unemployment.
The ministers wisely put aside the earlier idea of reintroducing narrow ERM
bands on January 1 1994. Instead, the system will continue indefinitely in
its new flexible form. ERM members thus have more opportunity to tailor
their monetary policies to their own needs rather than to Germany's.
Countries which have not yet made use of their flexibility to make more
aggressive cuts in short-term interest rates should be preparing to do so.
The French government argues that, by not responding to the August widening
of bands with greater monetary easing, it has sustained sufficient
credibility to enable long-term French interest rates to fall to German
levels. In spite of the strains of unification, yields on long-term German
debt are now just below 6 per cent, for only the third time in 25 years.
However, precisely because of France's achievement in reducing its inflation
rate to well below Germany's, real long-term interest rates in France, as in
most other EC countries, are still too high.
An important pre-condition for the necessary further fall in capital market
interest rates, in Germany and elsewhere, is that Germany itself reaches
long-delayed convergence with most of its EC partners by reducing its
inflation rate to the Bundesbank's 2 per cent target.
To prepare the way for recovery, EC governments need to reassert fiscal
control and to implement growth-generating measures. One welcome sign is the
effort many EC countries are now making to cut rigidities in labour markets.
As Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, stated at the weekend, a
quick EC escape from recession is unlikely. But by re-establishing the
primacy of economic reality over political vision, the Community is helping
to ensure that the recovery, when it comes, will be sustainable.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Whose line is it anyway?: The pressures to privatise
telecommunications in the EC look irresistible
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a fair bet that most of Europe's state telecommunications companies
will be privatised over the next five years.
By the end of the decade, telecommunications could be Europe's largest
equity sector, ahead of banking. 'In the next three years alone, telecoms
companies with combined capitalisation of Dollars 44bn look set to come to
market,' says Mr Richard Ryder, telecoms analyst at Salomon Brothers.
The pressure to privatise comes from three sources: overburdened state
budgets; under-resourced state telecommunications networks; and the
liberalisation of national and international telecoms markets, which is
undermining the position of state monopoly public telecommunications
operators (PTOs).
The balance of pressure varies between countries. But none is immune and,
with the European Community now resolved to liberalise national markets for
voice telecommunications traffic from January 1998, pressure can only
increase.
The predicament of Ireland's Telecom Eireann illustrates the position of
Europe's small and medium-sized PTOs. In some respects, TE is not
unfavourably placed. Ireland has been granted a five-year extension beyond
the 1998 competition deadline, so a state-owned TE could hide behind its
monopoly for another decade. After a heavy investment programme in the late
1980s, three-quarters of Ireland's exchanges are digital and TE provides an
array of value-added services such as call-itemisation on bills.
Yet few TE executives believe the status quo is viable, even in the medium
term. Overseas operators offering businesses call-back and leased-line
facilities are fast eroding TE's international revenue. To staunch the flow,
a recent radical 'rebalancing' of tariffs has reduced TE's international
prices sharply, while increasing local charges.
But that is only a palliative. Interest charges on 1980s investment are
consuming half of TE's operating profit. If margins continue to fall, TE's
investment plans will suffer; so will the profits the government creams off.
The worst-case, but plausible, scenario for five years hence is dire. It has
overseas operators forcing down TE's international tariffs and taking a
large slice of its profit; with dearer local calls, voters are attracted to
claims that price cuts will result from competition from, say, cable TV
operators offering telephone services; and state-owned TE is left with a
Pounds 1bn debt, an ageing network, 10,000 employees and a universal service
obligation in a country with more remote rural subscribers than New Zealand.
It is not surprising, then, that TE is engaged in talks with Cable and
Wireless, the UK group, about a possible alliance. When news of the C&amp;W
talks broke in the spring, Brian Cowen, Ireland's communications minister
insisted that 'privatisation is not on the agenda'. Yet in accepting that
alliances were vital to maintain TE's position 'in a sector which is moving
at an accelerating rate', he highlighted the dynamic likely to prompt
privatisation sooner or later.
The scale of the sales involved in these privatisations is breathtaking.
Severing links between PTOs and the public sector confronts established
interests at every turn. The regulatory implications are equally
far-reaching, challenging notions that the state should control 'strategic'
industries.
For investors, telecoms companies and merchant banks queueing to offer their
services, the opportunities created by privatisation are legion. Current
evidence suggests former state PTOs will head the list on most of Europe's
stock exchanges in terms of capitalisation, opening up a large blue-chip
sector for institutional investors. Telecommunications companies keen to
diversify will have an array of new strategic options.
The UK led the way on telecoms privatisation. The sale of British
Telecommunications was completed this summer, nine years after the disposal
of the first tranche of government shares. At nearly Pounds 27bn, BT has a
capitalisation far ahead of any other UK-based company.
Across the rest of western Europe, the industry can be divided into four
broad groups.
Listed companies. Part or all of the PTOs of Denmark, Spain, Italy and
Portugal are listed companies.
Only a third of the shares in Telefonica, the Spanish operator, are still
owned by the state. Nearly half of the shares of Stet, the Italian
telecommunications holding company, which controls six operating and
manufacturing companies, are in private hands. Marconi, one of Portugal's
three state operators, which handles international traffic, is only 51 per
cent state-owned. Eleven per cent of the shareholders in Tele Danmark, the
Danish PTO formed two years ago from the merger of four regional operators,
are non-government.
The Danish government plans to reduce its PTO stake to 51 per cent over the
next year, probably in a sale next spring. Both the Spanish and the Italian
governments are likely to reduce their PTO holdings before long. The
Portuguese telecoms industry is being rationalised and further privatisation
is under discussion.
Companies to be privatised from scratch. Germany and the Netherlands are the
principal candidates. A bill to privatise KPN, the Dutch postal and
telecommunications operator, is before the Dutch parliament. Legislation to
alter the German constitution is to be introduced this autumn to allow for
the sale of shares in Deutsche Telekom. More tentatively, Turkey's governing
coalition has agreed to privatise 49 per cent of the country's PTO.
State-directed PTOs. A decade ago, virtually all Europe's PTOs fell into
this category. Only Austria, Norway, Luxembourg and Switzerland are likely
to remain there. Should the Greek socialists take power after yesterday's
election, Mr Andreas Papandreou, their veteren leader, is pledged to halt
the privatisation of OTE, the Greek PTO. Its fate thereafter is unclear.
Corporations. Five PTOs - those of Belgium, Finland, France, Ireland and
Sweden - are, or soon will be, corporations. Although still owned by the
state, as corporations they have legal autonomy and substantial operational
independence.
Most of the corporations are heading towards privatisation at greater or
lesser speeds. 'Given the pressure to introduce competition and fund
expensive investment programmes, I would expect most of them to be in the
private sector within five years,' says Ms Kathy Burrows, telecoms analyst
at Dataquest Europe, a consultancy.
What differentiates them is mainly how open their governments are about the
likelihood of privatisation. Ireland's centre-left government repudiates the
notion. By contrast, Belgium's prime minister has indicated general support
for privatisation of Belgacom. His government is under intense pressure to
reduce the country's deficit, now approaching 7 per cent of GDP, and
privatisation receipts are an alluring prospect.
In July, Belgacom forged a strategic alliance with Pacific Telesis (Pactel),
the US regional operator, to build Belgium's new digital cellular network.
Pactel will take a 25 per cent stake in the network and participate in
management. The deal is widely regarded as a trial run for full
privatisation - although almost certainly with a different, possibly
European, partner. If the politicians can agree a scheme, a sale may not be
far off.
Europe's telecoms privatisations will not be carbon copies of each other.
Each PTO has peculiarities of its own. In particular, the status of
employees varies widely. Those countries, like Germany and Belgium, where
most employees have civil service contracts, face a legal and political
minefield.
However, two models are emerging. Governments with PTOs that believe they
can thrive in the emerging global telecoms market without a strategic
partner are likely to follow the UK in floating their PTOs in tranches, with
the intention of disposing of most shares.
The Netherlands is proceeding down that road. A first tranche of shares in
KPN will be sold early next year; a further sale is expected to follow by
1996, reducing the government stake to about 30 per cent. That will not
preclude KPN making post-privatisation alliances - indeed it is already a
party to several international consortia. But they will not be integral to
the privatisation.
By contrast, smaller PTOs are anxious to use privatisation as a way of
acquiring a strategic partner in the form of a big overseas operator taking
an equity stake. Here, the Greek model is widely cited - although it is
likely to be disowned by Greece itself.
Under it, 35 per cent of OTE, the Greek state operator, was to have been
sold to a strategic partner with management control, in return for a
guaranteed Dollars 7bn in investment over the next decade. Another 14 per
cent of the stock would have been floated on the Athens stock exchange,
leaving the government with a 51 per cent stake but little operational say.
However, the decision to sell is only the beginning, not the end, of the
privatisation process. Key issues remain: valuation, regulation, the
attractiveness of the PTOs to would-be investors and, perhaps most critical
of all, the speed and terms of liberalisation.
Two things appear certain. Technological advance, plus the European
Community's resolve to liberalise the 'voice' market by 1998 (with five
extra years' grace for Spain, Ireland, Greece and Portugal), means that
competition is imminent in every country. But the regulatory structure in
each country will have a large bearing on the speed it advances and the
strength of rival operators - and thus on the valuation of PTOs at
privatisation.
Providing rough-and-ready valuations of PTOs is easy enough, taking
multiples of earnings of comparable companies, subtracting debt and allowing
for local market conditions. However, as Mr Laurence Heyworth, telecoms
analyst at Robert Fleming Securities, puts it: 'A PTO is worth largely what
the government and management says it's worth.' For the valuation at sale
will depend heavily on government decisions on regulation, competition, the
freedom of managers to hire and fire and any sale of divisions of the PTO
itself.
Thereafter, the financial motivation of management will be critical.
Privatised PTOs likely to retain the character of a utility, such as Tele
Danmark, will be 'safe bet' investments akin to bond substitutes. By
contrast, companies intent on maximising shareholder value will lead a more
chequered life, floating off ancillary businesses (like cellular and
directory services), giving stock options to their senior executives, and
engaging in aggressive moves abroad. Mr Heyworth points to Italy as a leader
in the second camp.
On competition, the essential choice for governments is whether to promote
it at privatisation, or to let it arise on its own as the EC's 1998 deadline
is passed. The latter is the more popular option, although the Netherlands
may embrace an interim duopoly, as occurred at privatisation in the UK. Its
government is inviting the country's utilities, railways and cable operators
to join forces to provide a second national telecoms network.
But even for PTOs not facing immediate competition, there is no easy ride
through to 1998. Operators are finding ever more sophisticated means of
eroding national monopolies. Cellular telephony, in particular, is opening a
new avenue of competition across the continent. The first generation of
cellular mobile networks were mostly low-capacity and operated as PTO
monopolies. But the generation of digital services now coming on stream are
high-capacity networks and, in most cases, the PTOs face competition from
networks operated by one or more consortia of private, often foreign,
companies.
PTOs are likely to be attractive buys. On almost every stock exchange on
which they are listed, telecoms companies have been outperforming the
average. Even with competition and regulation, their earnings capacity
remains impressive. 'We are getting plenty of 'cold' inquiries: indications
of interest in forthcoming sales are extremely strong, and there doesn't
seem to be much concern about saturation,' says Mr David Wheeler, director
of the telecoms group at Lehman Brothers, the merchant bank.
That may come as a relief to those at the end of the queue. But the fight
among governments and PTOs for the front seats will be intense,
notwithstanding those such as Mr Papandreou.
This is the first in a series on the privatisation of Europe's state
telecommunications operators

FT  11 OCT 93 / New boys braced for store wars: Neil Buckley on a row
between UK supermarkets and newly arrived warehouse clubs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paul Moulton, the head of Costco Europe, a subsidiary of the US group,
jokes about his recent visit to the UK Department of Trade and Industry to
discuss plans to bring warehouse clubs - which offer cut-price goods to
members in no frill stores - to the UK.
'Who did I have to speak to?' he asks. 'A guy named Sainsbury.'
The reference is to Mr Tim Sainsbury, trade minister and cousin of Mr David
Sainsbury, chairman of one of the UK's biggest retailers, J Sainsbury. Mr
Moulton does not imply any impropriety in the relationship between the group
and the DTI: his point is that, for outsiders trying to enter the UK
retailing market, chains such as Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway are powerful
and ubiquitous opponents.
Now the 'big three' chains have taken the unprecedented step of launching
joint legal action against their potential competitor. The High Court will
next week hear an application from the three for the quashing of planning
consent for Costco's first UK warehouse club, at Thurrock, Essex. They say
it was wrongly assessed as a wholesaler, rather than as a retailer.
The superstore chains have instigated legal action, on the same grounds,
against another warehouse club project by UK cash-and-carry operator Nurdin
&amp; Peacock at Wednesbury, west Midlands.
The 'big three' say they are opposing the clubs on a point of principle in
planning law. But Mr David Poole, chief executive of Nurdin &amp; Peacock,
accuses the big three of a 'sinister' attempt to 'strangle warehouse clubs
at birth'.
Nervousness on the part of the big grocers caused by the arrival in the UK
of a new breed of retailer is understandable. In the US, the five biggest
warehouse club chains have grown from virtually nothing to sales of more
than Dollars 28bn last year. Their combined operating profits exceeded
Dollars 760m.
The concept of warehouse clubs is simple. They use large sheds to sell a
range of about 3,500 goods, from cat food to camcorders, at low prices - 25
per cent or more below high street prices - to a limited membership of trade
customers and individuals.
Costs are kept low by selecting cheaper sites that many retailers would
reject and cutting frills, such as expensive fittings. The clubs make money
by shifting large volumes and from the Dollars 25 to Dollars 35 annual fee
levied on members.
Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, has forecast that the clubs could
'turn the UK retail scene upside down' and achieve sales of Pounds 2bn a
year within 10 years. As supermarket margins in the UK are typically two to
three times higher than in the US, warehouse clubs would not have to cut
their margins as much to undercut the opposition.
But if this spells uncertainty for UK retailers, the stakes for Costco are
also high. Its drive to expand overseas is prompted partly by the much
tougher conditions which US warehouse clubs face at home.
Increased competition has led to saturation in some areas, while
general-purpose outlets such as Costco are being challenged by a new
generation of clubs specialising in products such as electrical goods. Last
summer, Price Co, which pioneered the warehouse club business, was forced
into a distress merger with Costco.
The big three UK supermarkets insist fear of competition is not the reason
for their battle against Costco and N&amp;P. They say it is unfair that
warehouse clubs are classified as wholesalers. Planning consent is easier to
obtain for wholesalers than for retailers because less detailed information
is required on, say, the impact on other shops or the environment. The
supermarkets say that in the US individuals, as opposed to businesses,
account forabout 35 per cent of warehouse club customers and a higher
percentage of turnover.
'We are not interested in denying warehouse clubs their place in the UK
market,' says a spokesman for the big three. 'We are just asking for
everyone to have to play by the same rules.'
The government has tried to clarify the dispute. A department of the
environment planning policy guidance note, PPG6, advises local authorities
that 'planning decisions should regard (warehouse clubs) as retail uses'. Mr
John Gummer, environment secretary, told Conservatives in Blackpool last
week he would 'clamp down on shops which masquerade as warehouses to avoid
planning restrictions'.
But PPG6 does not have the force of law and has been disregarded by
Hertsmere borough council, Hertforshire, which last month awarded wholesale
planning permission for a second Costco warehouse club, at Bushey, outside
London.
Safeway, Sainsbury and Tesco say they want to establish a legal definition
of warehouse clubs as retailers to confirm the government's policy guidance.
For Costco, Mr Moulton disputes that warehouse clubs are retailers, saying
that Costco is aiming to attract business from trade customers. He expects
most customers to be small independent shops, restaurants and cafes. But Mr
Moulton says the food superstores' case is largely based on allegations that
Costco failed in some cases to follow planning procedure to the letter. 'It
is over process rather than issues,' he says. Safeway, Sainsbury and Tesco
are, he believes, trying to obstruct Costco.
Even if Costco lost next week the long-term future of warehouse clubs need
not be jeopardised. It could delay and push up the cost of Costco's projects
at Thurrock and Bushey, and N&amp;P's project at Wednesbury, forcing them to
submit new applications for planning consent. Future developments may take
longer and cost more in the planning stages. But the advantage warehouse
clubs have in being able to use cheaper sites will remain. Mr Richard Hyman,
chairman of Verdict, the retail research company, says: 'Will a negative
judgment put their costs up? Yes. Will it make them pay a bit more for their
land? Yes. Will it stop them? Definitely not.'
However, the fears that the big retailers may have about the new arrivals
could be unnecessary. Verdict estimates that, in the foreseeable future, the
clubs are unlikely to account for more than about 2 per cent of the total
retail market. 'Evidence in the US is that the clubs cream off a little bit
of business across a range of sectors,' says Mr Paul Morris, retail analyst
at Goldman Sachs.
Moreover, the big three's campaign could have backfired. One senior
executive of a warehouse club operator says: 'A few months ago, I was
sitting with the marketing director wondering how on earth we could educate
the British public about warehouse clubs. The supermarkets have done the job
for us.'
Some retail industry observers believe that the big three retailers' action
reflects wider problems. The recession, customers'price sensitivity, the
influx into the UK of other cut-price operators such as Aldi of Germany, and
the increasing number of stores chasing sales in a fairly static market,
have put extra pressures on the large supermarkets.
'They are feeling very vulnerable,' says Mr Hyman. 'In no other retailing
sector have the leading players had such control. But for the first time for
a decade, these people don't know what is going to happen six or 12 months
down the line.'
Critics who see the big supermarkets' joint efforts to halt the warehouse
clubs as evidence that they are really a cosy cartel may be exaggerating.
Yet the vigour of their response suggests they may fear a bigger threat to
their dominance of food retailing than they have so far been ready to admit
in public.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: A question mark over gains expected
from a Gatt agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From G A ROUSSOPOULOS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I wish to question Samuel Brittan's presentation of the gains to be
expected from a successful conclusion to the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade negotiations ('Where Gatt's Dollars 200bn really comes from',
October 4).
First, the reference to net world annual gains of Dollars 213bn a year by
1992 is in itself no more than a rhetorically stunning device. Its real
significance is indeed best shown as 0.75 per cent of world income at that
time, plus or minus an uncertainty factor which probably exceeds that
figure, and which should be seen in the context of uncertainties in the
income itself in 2002, which can hardly be less than plus or minus Dollars
1,300bn. Nor may it be assessed, as he suggests, as a third of a normal
year's growth because it is not a renewable extra element each year, but, if
it arises, a once for all increase to a first order of approximation. It may
also be compared with inherent errors in the estimations of past actual
incomes which themselves are likely to exceed that 0.75 per cent. In other
words, the eventual effect will be so small as to be untraceable.
Second, one cannot confine oneself to a purely technical economic analysis -
there are factors to be considered of probably far greater importance to the
man in the street than a financial effect of 0.75 per cent, even if
economists prefer to neglect them because they are outside their frame of
reference, or because it has become politically incorrect in recent years to
question whether wholly free markets are always a good thing.
The experience of quasi-free global financial markets in which aleatory
surges of Gadarene financial opinion often swamp longer-term aspects would
suggest that the erection of partially autarkic zones, acting like dams on a
great river, may save millions of people from sacrificial drowning on the
altar of abstract three-quarter per cent trade theory without reducing the
availability of water. While the Soviet extremity of the economic spectrum
has been spectacularly discredited, one should also note that the opposite
end, perhaps best represented by the US, has equally clearly demonstrated
its own limitations in recent decades.
Variety in societies is important. Nations should retain freedom to seek
their own balance between financial and other indicators of a good life.

FT  11 OCT 93 / A navy all at sea: Ukraine is backtracking on the Black Sea
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The grey, trawler-like ship moored in front of the famous steps at the port
of Odessa flies one of the rarest sights on the seas: the blue cross and
trident emblem of a Ukrainian naval flag.
The Slavutich, an intelligence-gathering vessel, represents a quarter of
Ukraine's fledgling navy. During its two-year naval dispute with Russia,
independent Ukraine has bagged one light frigate that defected from the rest
of the fleet and has commissioned ships that were under construction at its
shipyards - a frigate, another light escort ship and the Slavutich. It also
has a hovercraft.
The remainder of the once-proud Black Sea fleet, which traces its traditions
back to Empress Catherine the Great of Russia, remains in an extraordinary
post-Soviet limbo.
A summit on September 3 between Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk and
Russia's President Boris Yeltsin at Massandra in the Crimea appeared to have
settled the fleet's future status. Ukraine would give up its entitlement to
half the 300-vessel fleet. In exchange, Russia would write off Ukraine's
debts to it for oil, gas and electricity, estimated at Dollars 2.5bn.
But Ukraine has been backtracking ever since. A joint Ukrainian-Russian
commission was set up for more detailed discussions, but the Massandra pact
now seems to be a dead letter. The other agreement reached there, allowing
Russia to take away strategic nuclear weapons deployed in Ukraine, has also
run aground, with the two sides differing about what they actually signed up
to.
Mr Yeltsin negotiated the naval deal from a position of strength. From a
Russian viewpoint, it seemed financially quite generous. Mr Kravchuk had to
take it or leave it.
But back in Kiev Mr Kravchuk met stiff opposition inside and outside the
government. The first question put by a journalist was how he felt about
betraying his country. His defence minister at the time, General Konstantin
Morozov, quickly distanced himself, saying he could not be responsible for
defending Ukraine's southern flank if the deal was implemented. He quit the
government last week.
Ukrainian officials now say the agreement was only to study the question of
a sale, emphasising that the ships-for-debt scheme was a Russian proposal.
Last week's violent showdown in Moscow between Mr Yeltsin and his political
opponents has complicated the issue still further - reinforcing the Russian
military's political influence and at the same time making Ukrainians even
more wary of their volatile big neighbour.
The fleet, with 70,000 personnel, about 40 major warships, 18 submarines,
some 250 other vessels and a similar number of aircraft and helicopters, has
been the focus of tension between the two countries. But more contentious
than the ships themselves are the shore-based support facilities, above all
the Crimean headquarters, Sevastopol. Russia's now disbanded parliament
outraged Ukrainian nationalists by questioning the Crimea's status as part
of Ukraine and passing a resolution in July claiming Sevastopol. The Crimea,
with a majority Russian population, was given to Ukraine in 1954, when no
one foresaw the break-up of the Soviet Union.
Mr Kravchuk, trying to justify himself on television, warned that pressing
Ukraine's naval claims could have sparked a revolt. 'We could well have lost
both the fleet and the Crimea,' he said.
Kiev's position is that the Russian and Ukrainian navies must be separated
and that the Russians must, in time, withdraw from Ukraine. Officials say
facilities could be shared while Russia builds an alternative base. Ukraine
proposed at Massandra including a protocol about renting Crimean bases. But,
say the officials, the Russian side would not accept the concept of rent,
since that would acknowledge Ukraine's ownership.
Earlier accords have been equally flimsy. Moscow's first plan was to assign
the fleet, or at least its main warships, to the Commonwealth of Independent
States' joint forces. In January last year, a framework agreement was
reached to give part to Ukraine. There followed three summit deals prior to
Massandra:
June 1992, in the Russian Black Sea resort of Dagomys. The fleet would in
principle be split.
August 1992, at Yalta. Up to 1995, the fleet would come under a joint
commander, answering to both presidents. This was unpopular in Ukraine.
June 1993, in Moscow. The fleet would be split 50-50, with joint use of
Sevastopol.
This latter plan, implementation of which was due to start in September,
provoked near mutiny among the fleet's conservative, Russian-dominated
officer corps. The joint commander, Russian Admiral Eduard Baltin, called it
'ruinous'. He had to stop his officers repeating their protest of the
previous month, when two-thirds of the fleet hoisted the Tsarist-era Russian
naval flag, a blue St Andrew's cross.
For now, the fleet's warships have orders to fly the Soviet navy flag, one
of the last remaining institutions to carry the old emblems. But tugs and
other auxiliaries in Sevastopol fly Russian ensigns, and a corner of the
harbour is reserved for the tiny Ukrainian-flag navy. It is, according to
one military observer, 'a complete farce'.
Ukraine is clearly ready to relinquish at least part of its theoretical 50
per cent share. Officials admit the fleet is of less military than economic
interest to the country. 'Many of the ships are old. We can sell them . . .
to Russia or another country.'
On the other hand, the Ukrainians want to build up a proper navy to protect
their 600-mile coastline and shipping lanes. By 1995 they will have 10
warships built. Shortly to join the fleet is a guided-missile cruiser,
provisionally christened Bohdan Khmelnitsky, after the 17th-century leader
of a Cossack rebellion against Poland. Ironically, the same man is held
responsible for subsequently subjecting Ukraine to the rule of Moscow. For
nationalist Ukrainians it might seem a bad omen.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Market place confused on environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr A S HEARNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Ian Rodger ('Accounting for 'green' efforts', September 29) is critical
of Ciba's recent corporate environmental report for its apparent lack of
clarity and comprehensiveness. He is focusing on the wrong target. He should
be focusing upon the way the market place is treating environmental issues.
Despite expressions of good intent from governments and inter-governmental
agencies, the market is in a state of confusion. There is no obvious way of
turning sustainable development into sustainable profits, particularly when
the economy needs rebuilding after recession. Consumers are showing
resistance to paying a premium for environmental goods. Many companies,
rather than adopting the government preferred route of Batneec (Best
available technology not entailing excessive cost) are driven by poor
profitability Catnip (Cheapest available technology not involving
prosecution)]
Environmental management systems from the British Standards Institute
(BS7750) and the EC (Emas) are complex, confusing and unnecessary for the
vast majority of businesses. The EC eco-labelling initiative is proving
difficult to get into effective operation. (How do all those bureaucratic
processes fit with de-regulation?)
With such a confused market we cannot expect companies to be clear about the
best ways of reporting. When the legislators, institutional investors and
consumers are clear about what they want, the market will deliver it and
companies will tell us how it is done. The cart needs a horse - preferably
at the front.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Nuclear energy a failed option
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SCOTT DENMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Ann Bisconti, employed by the US nuclear industry to paint rosy
pictures, makes a valiant, but vain attempt at statistical revisionism in
her letter, 'US public backs nuclear energy option' (September 29).
All recent independent national opinion surveys not generated by the nuclear
industry definitively show that Americans have had enough of the costly,
dangerous and unreliable nuclear power 'option'. Since 1982, the Harris
polls, Breglio/Lake and Frederick/Schneiders have all found that 60 per cent
or more of all Americans 'oppose the building/construction of more nuclear
power plants in the US'. In fact, each year since 1975 that this unambiguous
question has been asked, the result has always been a steady increase in
opposition. In 1992, 65 per cent of those polled were opposed to more
nuclear power development.
The 1992 poll by Frederick/Schneiders, commissioned by the Safe Energy
Communication Council, found that 76 per cent of Americans want the nation
to give top priority to renewable resources (like solar, thermal and wind),
energy efficiency and conservation, and natural gas (in that order). Nuclear
power was placed a distant fourth with only 11 per cent.
It is time for Ms Bisconti and other nuclear cheerleaders to face the music
of the market place. Despite receiving 65 per cent of all US energy research
and development funds since 1948, every US nuclear power plant ordered since
1973 has been subsequently cancelled. From main street to Wall Street, the
nuclear 'option' has failed the economic litmus test. The problem of sage,
permanent nuclear waste disposal remains intractable and unsolved. Safer,
cleaner and cheaper options exist today in the US and abroad.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Tide must turn against ageism in
workplace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms AMANDA BENNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, At last. Your report of the Eurolink Age study of age discrimination
('Ageism in the workplace', October 7) rightly asks why a large part of the
country's workforce is constantly swimming against the tide. As well as
changes to pensions and retirement arrangements, we can learn a lot from how
other countries organise their affairs.
This week people who care about age discrimination will examine what is on
offer for older workers throughout Europe at a big European Year conference
(October 11-13). The aim is to encourage all employers fully to recognise
the value of their older staff, and to train them to the limits of their
potential. But everyone throughout industry and commerce needs to look at
their own attitudes towards older people in their workplace, and at the
effects of their employment practices across the board.
In this European Year the tide must be turned on this particularly insidious
and destructive form of discrimination.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Arts: Strauss and Stravinsky - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was the small size of its audiences that originally prompted the BBC
Symphony Orchestra to shift some of its South Bank concerts into the smaller
Queen Elizabeth Hall. Having made the move, it has evidently decided to turn
economic necessity into musical virtue.
Although the orchestra's Strauss and Stravinsky series mostly consists of
full-scale works being played in the Royal Festival Hall, Friday's concert
was in the QEH and stripped the BBCSO down to chamber-orchestra proportions.
The programme explained in some detail how the two composers of this series
have nothing in common - an uncontroversial opinion, except that this
particular evening showed them heading down very much the same retrospective
path.
All the music was signposted 'neo-classical'. Richard Strauss's Suite from
Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme evokes the world of Beaumarchais with minuets, the
once enfant terrible of a composer prancing round in a perfumed wig.
Stravinsky's Dumbarton Oaks draws its style from Bach and Pulcinella its
material from Pergolesi. It would be interesting to create a series
examining why these forward-looking composers preferred to look back in
middle life.
A few years ago it would have been difficult to imagine the members of the
BBCSO exposing themselves to music-making on a small scale with any
confidence of success, but these days the orchestra has no reason to be
afraid. The playing of a dozen or so soloists in Dumbarton Oaks was trim,
accurate, exactly rhythmical, down to the precise double-dotting of the
horns.
We know from his Strauss in the opera-house (and Daphne at the start of this
series) that Andrew Davis is able to sort out the complex textures of a
Straussian orchestral score with lucidity. His performance of the Suite from
Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme was tightly controlled, but also characterful,
witty, cool-headed and chaste where others might surrender to its lusher
moments.
As to the Pulcinella, it could not be compared with Simon Rattle's recent
performance at the Proms, which in retrospect was effortful and sluggardly
(though he did have more players weighing the music down). Davis and his
chamber-sized BBCSO had shed excess fat and emerged slimmer, fitter, and
scintillating in the way one always imagined this music should be. Lynne
Dawson, John Graham-Hall and David Wilson-Johnson made a fine trio of vocal
soloists. Unqualified delight.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Arts: The power of prudence - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It stands like a blushing giant dwarfing its insipid neighbours. Alfred
Waterhouse's (1830-1905) Gothic palace for the Prudential Assurance company
has confidently gazed out on London's High Holborn since its arrival in
1879. This week the Queen is to take tea there to mark the completion of a
total refurbishment and rebuilding programme which the Prudential
Corporation initiated in 1989.
I have always thought that 'the Pru' was a wonderful building that guarded a
great secret. I recall vividly the excitement of glancing through the great
Gothic entrance gates as a child and seeing the dark silhouette of the
winged bronze angels on the war memorial. Two buxom lady angels dip their
uncovered breasts towards the limp and almost skeletal body of a dead
British soldier. Was he insured with 'the Pru', does he feel the sense of
confidence that emanates from these sturdy red walls? Part of the power of
the building comes from the power of 'the Pru'. Insurance companies became
very rich and powerful in the 19th century and their headquarters in the
City of London and their branches around the country were designed to exude
stability and, indeed, prudence.
It was natural for a company such as the Prudential to commission the
leading Victorian commercial architect, in the shape of Alfred Waterhouse.
He was rightly renowned for his clear planning and for his enthusiasm for a
free, picturesque Gothic style. His greatest works that survive are London's
Natural History Museum and the Town Hall in Manchester. His most successful
design was sadly never built. It was a competition design for the Law Courts
in the Strand which Waterhouse prepared in 1866. The competition was won by
George Edmund Street but Waterhouse's scheme was far more romantic, with
tall Gothic towers that would have rivalled the Palace of Westminster and
turned Thameside London into a second Camelot.
Waterhouse must have been a strange mixture. He came from a Quaker Liverpool
family, and yet was clearly a deeply romantic artist. His work combined the
two sides of his character: his plans were brilliantly workable and his
experiments with new materials and new forms of construction highly
successful, and yet no one designed more romantic skylines or painted more
delicate watercolours. He was that rare thing, the artist-architect who was
supremely practical.
Waterhouse gave the Prudential's head office the sense of reliabilty and
permanence that the company clearly wanted. The big, central Gothic tower
over the entrance to the inner court does not soar to heaven; it has a
solidity, despite its spiked pyramid roof. There is less detail here than
Waterhouse was to apply to the Natural History Museum and much of the
internal decoration, although good, is economical and repetitive. Faence
tiles and ornaments gleam after the refurbishment; their vivid colours,
especially the sharp yellow, are very vibrant.
In 1989 the great halls seemed not to suit the arrival of personal
computers. The days of thousands of clerks had passed. The company wisely
decided to restore and refurbish the best of the old buildings and to
redevelop the rest of the site over which they had spread, between Holborn,
Leather Lane, Geville and Beauchamp streets. Seen from the air, there is now
more new than old building on the site. The Prudential's own architects and
the firm, EPR Architects, have added two new buildings and four glazed
atria, providing many lettable offices as well as the streamlined modern
offices within the listed buildings.
There are big gains. Waterhouse Square is now at the centre of the site and
is a public right of way. It provides a quiet pedestrian square and an
opportunity to see much more of Waterhouse's original buildings. The view of
Waterhouse's glazed bridge is intriguing. What were his sources for this
glass bridge of sighs? And the architect's use of terracotta shows how
practical this material is for the damp northern European climate.
What of the new work? The Prudential's tradition of patronage continues,
particularly in the public spaces of the new offices. In their own main
entrance hall, the company has commissioned a work from a young sculptor,
Sally Matthews. 'The Dogs and the Peacock' is a free-ranging group of
lurcher dogs chasing a peacock across the reception hall and up to a high
balcony. It symbolises man's faithful friends chasing away vanity and pride.
I have to say that although the work is good of its kind, it does not seem
to work in this space.
The other new element of this project is the entrance hall to the
speculative offices called No. 2 Waterhouse Square. It has become almost the
norm for developers to invest a great deal of time and talent in the design
of a huge atrium or hall as an approach to what are essentially mundane
serviced office floors. This new atrium is no exception, an almost circular
space with a sweeping marble staircase that rises behind a ramped curved
marble wall. I had a distinct impression that I had somehow strayed from the
Victorian probity of Waterhouse's Gothic halls to some millionaire's marble
folly in Miami. I have to admit, however, that I was fascinated by the
centrepiece of this extravaganza which is a sculptural installation of a
great granite sphere which is constantly supported on a pad of water under
high pressure that allows it to spin freely, despite its enormous weight.
Waterhouse has been much blessed by this redevelopment. His version of the
Gothic does not seem a pale imitation of the medieval. It shines out in its
new surroundings as an intelligent, prudent and measured exercise of
Victorian civic architecture at its best.
I am sure the masters of the Prudential are familiar with the Titian in the
National Gallery that shows the triple human-headed figure of Prudence and
bears an inscription that could be roughly translated as a motto for this
redevelopment that has married past and present with some success: 'From
past experience the present acts prudently lest a future action be
vitiated.'

FT  11 OCT 93 / Arts: Jamais Vu, Always mad - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the start of his one-man show Jamais Vu at the Cottesloe Theatre, Ken
Campbell scans the National Theatre's programme to check what he is supposed
to be doing. While the David Hare trilogy continues at the Olivier Theatre,
Campbell's own remarkable trilogy can be seen on Saturday 23 October at the
Cottesloe. After all, he opened the theatre in 1977 with the eight-hour
Illuminatus.
Jamais Vu feels like the third leg of a quadruped. Its forerunners are
Recollections of a Furtive Nudist (1988) and Pigspurt (1992). The shows are
made up of personal stories which Campbell says he dare not tell his
friends: 'But it seems all right if people have paid.' Recollections led
Campbell into a case of 'enchanted vanishment' tracking down a vanishee from
King's Cross to St John's, Newfoundland; Pigspurt led him on a
sociobiological quest based on the shape of his nose.
Campbell's style is perplexing, infuriating and refreshing; sometimes
hilarious, often scatological, and always mad. It is no accident he went to
school in Barking. His contribution to British theatre is radical and
immense, including a 22-hour show at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in
London and the Science Fiction Theatre of Liverpool; and he has portrayed
lunacy in other media, from The Hitchhiker's Guide on radio to The Madness
Museum on television.
Quintessential Campbell is a dizzying monologue which defies gravity before
toppling into itself; add the twitching right foot, the eyebrows like
elevators and the nasal twang of his voice, and Campbell materialises. In
Jamais Vu the he uses a sink plunger to model his narrative. This is nowhere
near as fine of funny as its precursors, but it does deviate into sense and
wit.
The impossible story turns on a notice outside the hut of Chief Jack Naira
of Tanna in the South Pacific: We believe that Prince Pilip (sic) is
originally of Tanna and we want him to return home. This information takes
Campbell to the Uxbridge Secure Unit to talk to a member of the Ice Age
elite, then to discrepant paperback and hardback versions of a Prince Philip
biography and on to a world of bicycle clips and Pidgin English: What-name
you-me makim someting? or 'What shall we do?'
En route he stops for the occasional apercu: judges are law students who get
to mark their own exams; 'Guardian columnist' David Mellor has 'the look of
perhaps going to be witty in a minute'; and John Birt of the BBC is 'an
alien inadequately briefed, a man with a talent for retrospective absence'.
The deconstructive chaos is deftly scripted, patterned and now published.
Campbell's brilliance is his bravery and his disregard for what others think
of his kind of intelligence. Colin Watkeys tries to direct.
'Jamais Vu' is at the Cottesloe Theatre (071 928 2252) on October 13, 14,
and 22. 'Furtive Nudist', 'Pigspurt'and 'Jamais Vu' are at the Cottesloe on
October 23. 'Jamais Vu' is also at the Riverside Studios (081 7483354) from
November 3-23

With the first story now complete and a three-parter about to begin, Cracker
(ITV, 9.00) has turned out to be one of the brightest spots of the autumn.
Fitz, the super-intuitive criminal psychologist (Robbie Coltrane) now has
his mother, splendidly played by Beryl Reid, come to the assistance of his
private life.
Panorama; Pensioned Off (BBC1, 9.30) examines the fate of the universal
state pension. The pension probably ought to be axed, but after a life of
toil there are plenty of people who fail to see why they should not be
entitled to use their pension for a golf club subscription.
Prostitute (C4, 9.00), the grim French series, recounts a strangely
old-fashioned story about Monique, mother of seven. To keep her lover
solvent she worked as a prostitute and then turned Magdalene, swearing a vow
of chastity and going to live with other pious souls in a Catholic
community.
Night-owl jazz fans each year read glowing reviews in the FT of the jazz
festival at Brecon in Wales. This week on Midnight Jazz (BBC2, 12.05) five
programmes feature the high spots of the summer.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Arts: High spirits in Nuremberg - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first new production of the Royal Opera's 1993-94 season is the
company's first new Meistersinger for 24 years. Its plentiful high spirits
are distilled from a combination of bright primary colours, strong
involvement in leading roles, innumerable pinpoint comic cameos, and a
multitude of cheeky ingenuities of design and festive amusements in the
final scene.
Of all the myriad ways of tackling Wagner's overflowing, inexhaustible
masterpiece, this one is undoubtedly timely and aptly calculated. After
decades of looking to Germany for its Wagner modes and manners, Britain's
'international' opera company now chooses for itself a youthful British
production team (Graham Vick, producer, Richard Hudson, designer). The
conductor is Bernard Haitink, a Dutchman long cherished as one of the
glories of British musical life. Apart from the Swedish Walther, the cast is
entirely anglophone, and full of expectation-arousing newcomers to their
roles.
By all these collaborators the overall 'accent' of the performance has been
devised with conviction and decisive purpose. The design style is a
brilliant theatrical recreation of Breugel, in all his earthy
red-bloodedness, and Bosch, in all his fantastic inventiveness. Hudson's
scene-settings (expertly lit by Wolfgang Gobbel) are no simple
tableaux-vivants but a marriage of 16th-century and late 20th-century
artistic vision.
The tricks enacted with scale and perspective - sometimes broadly jokey, as
in the start to Act 2, sometimes wildly surreal, as in the riot, with
figures dangled madly from apertures in the roof - are at once postmodern
and authentically 'period'. Costume colours in the finale likewise:
cod-pieces flying, this is a Breugel public jollification filtered through
the production team's 1990s theatrical intelligence.
In many ways Covent Garden showed us one of the most broadly enjoyable of
Meistersinger stagings. No doubt it is pure critical curmudgeonliness to
have spent Friday evening as I did, simultaneously celebrating and
regretting the production stance. At certain points this regret was easily
explained: after so much naughty knockabout the gloriously hushed close to
Act 2 goes almost unrecorded - except by the intrusive squeaks of the mobile
set-partitions as they return to home base.
Generally, though, it took the form of a growing awareness that the breadth,
depth and, above all, quiet centre of the music were awakening precious few
echoes in the events on stage. So much personalised detail among the
Mastersingers] So many pratfalls for David and his workmates] So little
evening shade and reflective calm in the Act 2 streets of Nuremberg - and
only one parched-looking linden tree]
Repeatedly I found myself longing for a Meistersinger less determinedly
upbeat. Darker shadows are there for the searching-out; and while the notion
of Meistersinger-as-Nazi-triumph - as recently explored in a controversial
Frankfurt production - might be inappropriately downbeat for a Covent Garden
audience, the opera affords a more complex experience than here suggested.
Two additional possible causes for these mixed feelings suggest themselves.
The first is that Haitink, at his best a Wagnerian of incomparably muscular,
direct grip, seemed for the first two acts to be exercising that grip
excessively hard. The sound was often oddly abrasive, unblended, with
'interesting' stray ends of brass and choral timbre allowed to protrude, and
solo voices sometimes covered. The beautifully thoughtful moulding of the
Act 3 gave a taste of the settled-in Haitink Meistersinger soon (no doubt)
to be achieved.
The second concerns the new Sachs, John Tomlinson, a serious, forceful,
deeply committed artist already much prized as a Wagnerian on the Continent
and here receiving his belated 'big chance' at Covent Garden. The voice is a
mighty instrument - and goodness, how mightily he uses it] On this evidence
his bass lacks nothing in Sachs stamina and range but (to my mind) almost
everything in Sachs Innigkeit, meditative melancholy, gentleness of
statement, and all the other Sachs qualities dependent on legato line
steadily sustained. Leaping about like a neurotic leprechaun, Mr Tomlinson
certainly captures the shoemaker's restless energy; in voice and person this
Sachs is all of a piece.
The rest of the cast promote more traditionally Wagnerian vocal values,
though peak form eluded most of them on Friday. Gosta Winbergh's Walther,
handsomely solid and well-balanced of tenor timbre from beginning to end,
needs to produce more personality, more conversational vitality; Deon van
der Walt's David, so full of bounce, needs to find more charm and sweetness
in his Act 1 recitation; Nancy Gustafson, an Eva of picture-book good looks
and apt vocal warmth, needs to make far more of her words. Two Covent Garden
'old hands' at this opera - Gwynne Howell (Pogner), Anne Howells (Magdalene)
 -gave great pleasure.
And so does Thomas Allen's first Beckmesser, easily the greatest of the
evening. It is perhaps a problem - but more for others on stage than the
audience - that much of the finest singing should be delivered by this
particular character; but there is more to the performance than excellently
clean, stylish, colourful vocalisation. In a brilliant feat of character
observation, with dead-fish hands a-flutter, spectacles a-fidget, glances
madly snatched, with point and purpose in its tiniest eyelid-flicker,
Beckmesser's warped intelligence and swiftness of perception are newly
imagined. And, as a result, the whole opera is newly enlivened and enriched.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Management: Make it interesting between the covers - Tips
from the top / Eric Nicoli, chief executive of United Biscuits, offers
advice on how to prepare an annual report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC NICOLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few people can resist those magazine quizzes that claim to reveal your inner
personality. So try this one on your corporate personality: pick up your
annual report and approach it as a stranger might. Is it: (A) meeting all
fiscal requirements, retrospective, financially opaque, short on expensive
visual interest, long on verbal camouflage? or (B) only the first two of the
above, but more besides - financially transparent, visually interesting,
well written and giving a clear, concise account of business issues past and
present?
If you're instinctively happier with option A, and evidence from many UK
companies suggests you are not alone, then move to my final paragraph. If
you think there might be something in option B, read on.
At UB, we aspire to option B and the research we commission each year shows
we are making progress, as our annual report becomes a recognised plank of
our investor relations programme. It is the one uniting document that we
have for our company as a whole, and as we have to live with it all year, we
prefer to make it count.
Of course the audiences of our annual report are diverse, but we have
prioritised them and we try to define appropriate messages. We can't be all
things to all people, but we can structure the report so that the browser
gets as much from it as the cover-to-cover merchant. As well as all the
usual messages, we use our report to lay out our strategy to all
stakeholders and show the progress we're making.
The easy bit is getting the report produced. Occasionally we hear nightmare
stories of reprints and erratum slips. There is an easy way to avoid all
this: sort out the internal mechanisms of tasks and responsibilities, only
involving yourself in the process at useful and vital stages - and make sure
you employ good people internally and an experienced design consultancy.
Your designers need to understand financial audiences, but most importantly
you must help them understand your corporate culture and taste. We sit down
from time to time with our designers and other people's annual reports. We
sort them into those we like and those we don't. Alarmingly, given the money
that everyone spends on this exercise, the second pile is usually bigger.
It's important to give your team time to get a good job done. However, you
need to retain flexibility up to final copy deadline to make sure the
messages are up to date. This year we turned our designers' hair grey with
our negotiations to sell a large division, the Terry's Group, as we
approached the print date. They covered the photographic content of the book
every which way, finalising the cover only days before going to press.
This was probably a good thing, because the cover can be the topic of
interminable debate. It has to reflect the content of the book, be different
enough from the previous year, but also needs to reflect unchanging
corporate values and differentiate itself from your competitors.
The only subject more fraught than covers is how to shoot your board,
photographically speaking. Make sure your designers employ a patient,
experienced photographer who can work fast and with suitable regard for
vanity. Don't be afraid of cheating - they don't all have to be there
together and they won't all be beautiful. If necessary, resort to
retouching; I'm thinking of having hair in next year's report. One final tip
 -don't let your finance people make any design decisions other than what
colour the back pages should be.
Options A and B will cost you almost equal amounts of money. The design,
production and printing of your annual report will cost you approximately 20
per cent of the audit fee to produce the financial accounts required in the
back. The print bill will be at least 15 per cent; so the 5 per cent you
spend on design, writing, photographic content, together with adequate
amounts of management time can turn a fiscal necessity into a useful
corporate tool.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Management: Down with super egos - Lucy Kellaway on tackling
megalomania in the office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How satisfying to be John Casablancas, head of Elite Model Management in New
York. Last month he told his most famous model, Naomi Campbell, that he had
had enough. He was fed up with her tantrums, fed up with her 'greedy and
demanding' ways and fed up with being 'demeaned, used and abused'. Never
mind the large fees she brought in - she was out.
This story made world news not just because every trip of Campbell's on the
catwalk is an event. The toppling of a giant ego is a rare spectacle, and
one much enjoyed at a distance by everyone who has to deal with egos
themselves.
Tantrum throwing, foot stamping, sulking, uncontrollable super egos are not
only to be found in 23-year-old models. Among writers, musicians, sportsman,
actors and chefs, famous egos abound. John Osborne, Dustin Hoffman, Marco
Pierre White, John McEnroe, the list goes on.
Neither are big egos limited to 'creative' people. Robert Maxwell may have
been the biggest, but is by no means the only example of an ego in commerce.
'You need narcissism to become a business leader. But when you get to the
top, funny things start happening,' says Manfred Kets de Vries, a practising
psychoanalyst and professor at the Insead business school in Fontainebleau,
near Paris. 'People idolise authority figures, so senior executives tend to
get surrounded by liars.'
It is not difficult to spot when an ego has got too big. Super egos do not
listen, they have to be in the limelight, their judgment gets wonky, they
refuse to take blame, they have to be in control, they want the biggest
aeroplane and they surround themselves by yes-men.
Nearly every company has one, but how do you deal with them?
With most super egos, the Casablancas option is not open. Very occasionally
directors get together and decide that the boss's rampant ego is a luxury
the company can no longer afford. But for most of the time, the problem is
one of containment and co-existence.
When a two-year-old child throws a tantrum, there are two possible courses
of action. Either you take them on your knee and cuddle them, or you throw
them in their cot and shut the door. With adult egos, the choice is a
similar one. You can pacify them or you can confront them.
The first route involves kowtowing, but may in some cases be the best
option. 'You realise that they are on an ego trip, and you bow, scrape and
tug your forelock. You play the game in the interests of a quiet life,' says
Peter Honey, a psychologist and management consultant.
This may work for egos you only have to deal with occasionally. One literary
agent who works for some famously bad-tempered writers has become adept at
avoiding conflict. 'I accept that my writers are entitled to be as difficult
as they like. I look for the warning symptoms. If I am dealing with someone
who I know gets upset about their royalties, I try to anticipate that. There
are other people that get apoplectic if I don't ring back in five minutes,
so I try to be prompt.'
The other approach is to take them on. This requires more courage and needs
to be handled with care. 'You have to choose when and on what issues. Work
out where your bottom line is, and on everything else grin and bear it,'
says Honey.
Tim Halford spent 10 years with Armand Hammer, one of the biggest egos of
them all. During that time he was fired four times and had back four times.
His job routinely included such things as getting Hammer seats at the royal
wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer in full view of the US
television cameras. Yet Halford found his own way of standing up for
himself.
'If you've got someone with an ego, you must never dent it publicly. With
Hammer, if you were 100 per cent sure of your ground, it was possible to
tackle him quietly. He would accept that he was wrong.'
Some experts argue that there is little colleagues can do to soften the
behaviour of office egos. The most difficult cases, says Kets de Vries, are
businessmen who also own the company. 'The only possibility is for that
person to have a coronary - then you have a lever and can do something with
them'.
In public companies, there may be other more sympathetic figures of
authority to turn to, but Kets de Vries warns that this could be dangerous.
'The moment you blow the whistle, your head comes off.' He reckons that if
your boss has too high an opinion of himself, your best route might be to
find another job.
He argues that these super egos are in need of professional help. He
compares the role as psychoanalyst with that of Alcoholics Anonymous: 'I try
to wean them away from their Genghis Khan characteristics.' Simply telling
the truth may get nowhere. 'Very often these people are like Teflon. The
truth just slips off.'
While colleagues may be unable to prick inflated egos, companies can help
prevent them from puffing up in the first place.
Gerard Egan, professor at Loyola University, Chicago, has traced the careers
of many business egos who have started out as entrepreneurial talents but
have eventually brought about the downfall of their companies. He cites RH
Macy, the US retailer, and Sunbeam-Oster, the household appliance
manufacturer, as examples of companies where the boss's ego has contributed
to a business's rise and fall.
Despite the financial damage tyrannical managers can do, few companies seem
aware of the problem, argues Egan. Managers and supervisors who
instinctively know when to confront, when to encourage, when to leave alone,
are needed, yet companies put little effort into making sure their managers
have and use these qualities.
All managers need someone who will be their confidant, who will quietly tell
them when they have overstepped the mark. People who constantly lose their
temper need a colleague to take them aside and tell them what they look like
when they get really angry.
Companies can also retard the growth of egos by appraisal systems in which
peers and underlings as well as their superiors give their views. This
all-round view may discourage damaging behaviour before it becomes too
deeply entrench-ed.
Not all big bosses let success go to their heads. Kets de Vries singles out
Richard Branson for praise. Egan mentions Bill Gates. Those who have been
bawled out for criticising Branson or have seen Gates' plans for a
multi-million dollar underground bunker might not agree.
Yet the point is not that these two are modest. It is, as de Vries says,
that they have 'put their narcissism to good creative use'.

FT  11 OCT 93 / People: New presidents for electrical groups
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two UK electrical associations, EIEMA and GAMBICA, have announced the
appointment of new presidents, each of whom will serve for a year.
EIEMA, the Electrical Installation Equipment Manufacturers' Association, has
named Stephen Lawson, chairman and managing director of Lawson Fuses, as its
new president. Lawson worked for the North Eastern Electricity Board before
joining Lawson Fuses in 1972.
At Gambica, the Association for the Instrumentation, Control and Automation
Industry in the UK, the new president is Graham Woodhead, a director of
Meggitt.
Woodhead worked for the British Thermostat Group, BTR and Minibea before
joining Bestobell in 1972.
When Bestobell was acquired by Meggitt in 1984, Woodhead was appointed
managing director of the controls division.

<TEXT>
Gartmore, the investment fund manager wholly owned by Banque Indosuez, today

FT  11 OCT 93 / People: NatWest chalks up academic forecaster
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Proof that the world of City economists is peopled not just by bright young
things in their 20s comes with the move to financial markets of Geoffrey
Dicks, right, a 46-year-old academic doyen of forecasting.
Dicks, who has worked at London Business School for the past 17 years, takes
over today as UK economist at NatWest Markets, the securities arm of
National Westminster Bank.
'I thought my chances of entering the City had gone long ago,' says Dicks,
who is currently the LBS's head of forecasting.
He has previously worked as an economist at the Department of Employment,
and as a school teacher.
Dicks's chance to embark on a new career - with a 'significantly higher'
salary - came a few weeks ago when NatWest's head of strategy, Bob Semple,
called him out of the blue.
Semple asked the business school guru whether he would be interested in
taking over from Paul Neild, another golden oldie on the wrong side of 40,
who had left NatWest unexpectedly for personal reasons.
The new NatWest incumbent scorns suggestions he may be too old to adapt to
the cut and thrust of the City. 'I am solidly unacademic,' he says. 'Also
I'm an early morning person so I won't have any trouble with the early
starts.'
However, Dicks will probably have to reshape his lifestyle somewhat.
At the LBS he has had the luxury of working at his home near Exeter every
Friday, a practice he sadly reckons he will have to give up.
At NatWest Dicks will join two other greybeards of the economics world;
Robert Thomas is in charge of analysing bonds and currencies, and David Kern
is chief economist of the UK banking side.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Construction Contracts: New French headquarters for Nestle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BOVIS SA, a wholly owned subsidiary of the P&amp;O company Bovis International,
has won an Pounds 85m management contract to build the new 650,000 sq ft
headquarters for Nestle France at Noisiel, Seine-et-Marne, 18km east of
Paris.
The 30-month project, which starts on site in February 1994, involves the
refurbishment of a group of listed 19th-century industrial buildings that
line the banks of the River Marne and the construction of a 200,000 sq ft
building.
The 34-acre development, which includes an 8-acre island, will welcome 1,850
Nestle staff from several subsidiaries in January 1996.
Nestle has made the restoration of the listed buildings one of its main
priorities. One of these, a mill built in 1871, will be fully restored to
show the original hydroelectric machinery in the basement.
An area of the bank alongside the mill will be transformed into a square
that will feature the foundations of the old factory's main chimney. The
upper floor of the mill will be fitted out to provide offices for the Nestle
board.
One of the first reinforced concrete structures built on the island will
also be fully restored. Built in 1906, the 'Cathedral' was designed by
Stephen Sauvestre, a partner of G. Eiffel, famous for tower construction. It
is linked directly to the other buildings on the site by an arched concrete
bridge that has a span of 146ft. The length of the span was believed to be a
record at the beginning of this century.
Internal fittings will be the same in the refurbished and new buildings
offering Nestle's staff space, a high level of comfort and the latest
communications technology. Bovis SA will also manage the fit-out.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Southwark Council and the London Institute have chosen proposals put forward
by AMEC for a regeneration scheme to be carried out at the Elephant and
Castle in south London.
The Pounds 57m scheme involves redevelopment of an area currently occupied
by the Elephant and Castle leisure centre and its adjacent car park - the
largest council landholding in the area.
AMEC's proposals include provision of a leisure centre for use by the
community; together with a new teaching block and student residential
accommodation for the adjacent London Institute. St Mary's Churchyard, a
nearby open space, will also be improved in terms of layout and appearance
as part of the overall develop-ment.
AMEC has proposed a four-storey leisure centre, constructed as an important
landmark for the area.
Facilities will include competition, training and leisure pools, a health
spa, squash courts and a 36.5m x 32m multi-purpose sports hall.
A dance studio, community rooms and a spectator area will be also be
provided, as will a library/exhibition area and a weight training room.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Construction Contracts: Pounds 25m marine treatment works
scheme
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BIWATER TREATMENT, a division of Biwater Europe, has been awarded a Pounds
25m contract for the design and construction of the new Eastbourne Marine
Treatment Works by Southern Water.
The scheme is a big part of Southern Water's 'Operation Seaclean', and will
provide primary treatment facilities for up to 216,000 cu m per day of
incoming sewage from Eastbourne and surrounding areas.
The works, scheduled for completion in December 1995, will incorporate fine
screening, grit removal and chemically assisted primary settlement using
lamella plate separators. The primary effluent will then be pumped to sea
via a 3.2km outfall.
The plant will be completely underground involving highly complex civil
construction due to its location on the seashore.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Heseltine warns Tory factions over risk of split
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL HESELTINE, trade and industry secretary, warned yesterday that
the Conservative party might split if either the left or the right was
allowed to feel it could dominate. His warning came as Baroness Thatcher's
memoirs reopened old divides among ministers.
The former prime minister's criticism of Mr John Major, in the book's
official serialisation which began yesterday, is more muted then unofficial
extracts had suggested. She does, however, say of his time as chancellor
that 'intellectually he was drifting with the tide'.
Her fiercest words are reserved for Lord Lawson, her long-serving former
chancellor, and Lord Howe, her long-standing close colleague.
As former ministers leapt to defend themselves against the charges, Mr
Heseltine expressed regret at the nature of recent political memoirs, saying
that they reflected most severely on their authors. His intervention in the
debate about the future of the party came after a Conservative conference at
which rightwing views seemed to be in the ascendant.
Speaking on BBC Television's On The Record programme - his first interview
since his heart attack in June - Mr Heseltine said that every party was a
coalition of different interest groups.
'If ever you get to a stage where the left of the party or the right of the
party feel they have got such power that they can pull the whole thing their
way, the danger is that the bits at the other end will snap,' he warned.
He also made a strong attack on a few backbench Tory MPs who were, he said,
outside the mainstream of the party and far too ready to rebel against the
government over any difficult decision.
While sounding relaxed about the strongly Euro-sceptic tone adopted by
ministers during the past week, Mr Heseltine re-emphasised the importance
that must be attached to the economic and trading relationship with the rest
of Europe.
He also expressed opposition to the changes suggested by Lady Thatcher to
prevent a sitting Conservative prime minister being challenged for the party
leadership. A serious contest was forced only in extreme circumstances, he
said.
Lord Lawson said on BBC Radio yesterday that Lady Thatcher's failure to come
to terms with her fall fuelled her search for scapegoats. He denied that he
had 'taken his eye off the ball'.
Lord Howe said there were many errors of fact and judgment in the extracts
from the memoirs, which he would seek to correct.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Blair tipped for premiership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TONY BLAIR, Labour's modernising shadow home secretary, receives
encouraging support today from an unexpected quarter - a panel of 105 top
industrialists, bankers, business executives and other opinion formers.
The panel, half of whom come from the business world, tip Mr Blair as the
person most likely to be prime minister in the year 2000. They put him ahead
of Mr John Major, other Conservative leadership contenders and Mr John
Smith, the Labour leader.
More surprising, Mr Blair is also the panel's preferred choice for Number 10
Downing Street.
He attracts three times the support of the prime minister, and more than
twice the support of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, who is favoured by
many to succeed Mr Major.
The endorsement for Labour's foremost moderniser emerged from a poll by
Opinion Leader Research asking Britain's most influential opinion formers
for their views on the UK in the year 2000.
In general panel members are pessimistic about the future, expecting the
UK's decline in world influence to continue. China will gain the most in
influence, says the panel, followed by Japan, the US and Germany. Russia and
India are also expected to become more influential by the year 2000.
The opinion formers say their main concern for the UK over the next few
years is the economy - both general economic performance and loss of
international competitiveness.
There is also concern over continuing high levels of unemployment. More than
two thirds think the total is likely to remain at more than 3m by the end of
the decade.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Major escapes full public handbagging: But Thatcher heaps
fury on Howe and Lawson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SO Mr Major could breathe a small sigh of relief. After all the advance
hype, the publication yesterday of official extracts from Baroness
Thatcher's memoirs proved a predictable anticlimax.
True, she is not exactly full of praise for her successor. She makes little
secret of her reservations about his intellect and ideological backbone. She
wonders aloud whether she would have backed him if she had managed, as she
planned, to continue her premiership beyond a fourth general election
victory.
There is probably more to come when The Sunday Times publishes its second
set of extracts next week. Lady Thatcher believes that Mr Major deserted her
during the first round of the 1990 leadership campaign in which Mr Michael
Heseltine brought her down.
But to anyone who has heard Lady Thatcher speak in private of Mr Major,
these are distinctly modest criticisms. Around the lunch or dinner table she
has accused him of being weak and indecisive and of abandoning the
commitment to sound public finance. But in writing her memoirs she has been
persuaded to exercise a degree of the self-restraint and self-discipline
which deserted her in her final years in Number 10 Downing Street.
The real venom is reserved for Lords Howe and Lawson. These were the
principal architects of the Thatcher revolution: the men in her government
who provided the intellectual framework which translated her ideological
instincts into a coherent set of policies.
But it was her disagreement with them over the European exchange rate
mechanism and, in the case of Lord Howe, Europe more generally that
precipitated the final implosion of her cabinet.
Thus Lord Lawson is at once praised for his intellect and then accused of
'folly' in allowing his determination to get sterling into the ERM to
override her determination to hold down inflation.
Somewhat implausibly for those who followed the argument at the time, he is
accused of wanting constantly to cut interest rates while she was forever
asking for the burden on homeowners to be increased. The Financial Times is
credited for tipping her off in November 1987 about his policy of shadowing
the D-Mark.
No matter that everyone of importance in Whitehall knew of the policy months
earlier. For Lady Thatcher her then-chancellor's approach is proof that:
'the belief that the laws of economics and the judgments of the markets can
be suspended by clever people is a perpetual temptation to folly.' The
truth, of course, is rather more complicated than that.
Providing a deliciously ironic, and presumably unconscious, assessment of
the forces behind her own down-fall, Lady Thatcher concludes a bitter attack
on the 'treachery and bile' of Lord Howe with the thought that: 'Above all,
I suspect, he thought he had become indispensable, a dangerous illusion for
a politician.'
Her single mistake, according to Lady Thatcher, was failing to sack her
chancellor and foreign secretary. Britain would have stuck with a floating
pound and would have taken the path towards economic prosperity as its 11
European Community partners foolishly isolated themselves by embarking on
monetary union.
Even the poll tax, she seems to believe, might have been made to work. She
would have won the election and, just about now, would be contemplating a
graceful move into retirement. In the words of one cabinet minister
yesterday: 'Such are the delusions of once-great political lead-ers.'
Sadly, Mr Major cannot brush aside so casually the legacy of his
predecessor. Her influence is waning. Even in great leaders,
self-justification is too easily self-defeating.
The ideological warfare in Blackpool last week was a potent reminder that
the instincts of Thatcherism live on in a significant section of the Tory
party. Mr Major needs time to rebuild his authority after the ravages of
Maastricht and of the recession. So he is ready to re-adopt some of the
rhetoric of Thatcherism.
But Lady Thatcher's assumption that the prime minister's emphasis on
traditional Tory values will signal a return to what he has described as a
'golden age that never was' is mistaken. In Mr Major's mind the golden age
was represented by the 1950s, not the 1980s. So Mr Clarke will tell anyone
ready to listen that whatever the rhetoric of Messrs Peter Lilley, Michael
Portillo and Michael Howard, he is not about to dismantle the welfare state.
Nor is Mr Douglas Hurd intending to conduct Britain's European policy on the
basis of the cheap insults of some who sit around the cabinet table.
Thatcherism is not dead. It has an able, if still youthful, standard-bearer
in Mr Portillo, a politician who combines Lady Thatcher's gut instincts with
some of the intellect of Lords Howe and Lawson.
But it will take a general election defeat rather than an image of the
recent past through rose-tinted spectacles to reconvert the Tory party to
the ideology it rejected in 1990.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Escapes from wider VAT net sought: Industry chiefs are
lobbying strongly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel is a foregone
conclusion, the growing threat that Mr Kenneth Clarke might widen the tax
net still further has triggered a wave of intense lobbying to try to warn
him off.
In the next few weeks the chancellor can expect the usual pre-Budget
avalanche of special pleading to hit the Treasury. This year, much of that
pleading will be aimed at preventing something which has daily appeared more
likely - an extension of VAT to more goods and services.
The public will not escape the propaganda either. On buses and trams, at
airports and railway stations, in newsagents' and other shops, the battle to
fend off VAT is well under way.
Sir Bob Reid, British Rail chairman, has already warned Mr John McGregor,
transport secretary, that a full VAT rate applied to rail fares would wipe
out 10 per cent of rail business.
Coming on top of the fare increases already in the pipeline, any further
rises would deal a 'massive blow' to the railway system, according to the
Central Transport Consultative Committee, the rail users' watchdog. But the
committee has been fully occupied fighting privatisation plans and admits
that any resources for tackling the VAT issue are strictly limited.
The Bus and Coach Council, however, has just stepped up its campaign against
VAT on fares, claiming the measure could destroy 1,300 jobs for every 1
percentage point of VAT. It says that imposing the full rate of VAT would
raise Pounds 2.3bn in revenue for the Treasury, all of which would be wiped
out by the broader economic losses arising from its imposition.
The council, which represents operators and manufacturers with a turnover of
Pounds 4bn, has sent campaign packs to its 1,200 members and is pinning up
posters across the country urging people to 'Fight VAT on fares'. Petitions
are being organised and trade unions are being urged by operators to help in
the fight.
Among the most active campaigners is British Airways, which this weekend
began a leaflet campaign at airports across Britain to alert passengers to
the danger of higher fares and to enlist their help in fighting it. The
airline fears it could lose up to 500,000 passengers if VAT is introduced.
Last week BA executives went to the Conservative party conference in
Blackpool to buttonhole MPs and ministers and press the airline's case. They
pointed out that if VAT is applied at the full rate on air fares, a typical
business return fare from London to Glasgow would rise by Pounds 40. They
stressed that some corporate customers, such as financial service companies,
would not be able to reclaim the tax.
BA was not alone in lobbying at Blackpool. Leaders of the Periodical
Publishers Association were also present to meet ministers and warn them of
the effect on education and literacy of a tax on the printed word -
something abandoned in Britain in 1855.
The association last week published a special edition of Magazine News
devoted to VAT. It has also launched a national advertising campaign to
reinforce publishers' claims that imposing the full VAT rate on magazines
would cost more than 4,000 jobs and close as many as 1,700 titles.
The newspaper industry is mounting its second national campaign in eight
years against VAT on newspapers. It has more shock statistics which it hopes
will influence the chancellor, although it concedes that the treatment of
some politicians and members of the royal family at the hands the press may
not exactly help its case for sympathetic treatment.
The industry calculates that 245 local and regional papers would close
which, it points out, could well deprive some MPs of the most important
constituency outlet for their views. The industry has just commissioned a
series of articles by politicians setting out the case against VAT on
newspapers, which it hopes 1,300 regional and local newspapers will run in
the next few weeks.
Books, too, are putting up a fight. The National Book Committee,
representing authors, booksellers and publishers, says the imposition of VAT
would cut book sales by 5 per cent, further increase the problem of poor
reading skills, while raising only a 'paltry' Pounds 270m in tax revenue.
Mr Tim Godfray, chief executive of the Booksellers Association, says 3,500
sales outlets have been asked to join an anti-VAT campaign, and October 16
has been designated as Books Add Value Day.
In spite of the political sensitivities, the prospect of VAT on children's
clothes and some food items has not been ruled out. The British Retail
Consortium, representing high street traders, will forcefully restate its
views to Mr Clarke in person when it meets him later this month.
The National Children's Wear Association has been organising a petition for
presentation later this month to the prime minister, and the Apparel,
Knitting and Textiles Alliance is pressing ministers and MPs to leave
children's clothes alone.
The overriding need for Mr Clarke to seek new sources of revenue means that
all the arguments against the extension of VAT may finally fall on deaf
ears.
The best chance opponents may have of winning the day may still lie in the
government's slim majority and the apparent readiness of some Tory
backbenchers to spoil the best-laid plans of their ministers.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO senior newspaper executives last night strongly condemned the possible
imposition of VAT on newspapers.
Sir David English, chairman of Associated Newspapers, said on BBC TV's The
Money Programme that the move would be 'devastating'. He added: 'If the
industry absorbs it, it will wipe out virtually all profits. If it does not
absorb it, it will cut horrendously into circulation figures.'
Mr Andrew Knight, News International chief executive, warned on the same
programme that that the move could kill off a number of titles.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Warning on 'misleading' pay details: Fringe benefits can
distort the remuneration picture painted in company reports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIGURES on directors' pay included in company annual reports substantially
understate remuneration, a survey of executive pay and benefits suggests
today.
On average the director of a British company earns a basic salary of Pounds
92,306, but receives additional benefits in bonuses, pension contributions,
company cars, insurance and other fringe benefits worth Pounds 62,428,
according to the survey by Bacon &amp; Woodrow, the actuaries, and Remuneration
Economics, a salary and benefits specialist.
Bonuses are normally disclosed in companies' annual reports but details of
fringe benefits, which can be very valuable, are rarely published.
Mr Keith McNeish, a senior consultant at Bacon &amp; Woodrow, said:
'Institutional and private shareholders should be concerned about the
findings because they reveal just how inaccurate and misleading it can be to
rely on annual reports or salary figures alone as an indicator of directors'
pay levels.'
The survey covers the pay of 1,434 directors in 222 companies, and includes
more than 20 FT-SE 100 companies and top building societies and insurance
groups.
Some directors are paid more than double their basic salary when additional
benefits are taken into account, the survey says. In addition, company
directors own share options worth on average an extra Pounds 298,320, or
double their average annual total remuneration.
'There is a delusion that pay is all about basic salary,' said Mr McNeish,
who said he was surprised by the size of overall packages.
The 190 chief executives surveyed received average basic pay of Pounds
157,706 and a total package - including bonuses and benefits - worth Pounds
261,327. Their share options were worth on average an additional Pounds
619,107.
The average value of benefits received by chief executives included life
assurance of Pounds 4,195, company car allowance worth Pounds 14,164,
private fuel allowances of Pounds 1,431, medical insurance worth Pounds
1,033, permanent health insurance of Pounds 2,312, extra holiday worth
Pounds 4,587, subsidised loans of Pounds 2,581, other insurance benefits of
Pounds 2,693, and pension contributions of Pounds 36,395.
Pensions are the element of remuneration which varies most widely. Company
contributions can vary from as little as 5 per cent of basic salary to as
much as 90 per cent.
Bonuses, received by two-thirds of respondents, are worth, on average, a
further 16 per cent of basic salary.
Overall total pay packages vary widely across regions and industries. The
average package for a director in inner London amounts to Pounds 237,000
compared with Pounds 155,000 in the west Midlands and Pounds 96,000 in the
east Midlands.
Directors appear to be best paid in the food and drink industry, where chief
executives were paid an average of Pounds 366,865 compared with 339,190 in
retail and distribution, Pounds 272,851 in finance, Pounds 231,870 in
chemicals, Pounds 217,585 in energy and engineering, and Pounds 210,105 in
high-tech sectors. By contrast the chief executives of the seven
public-sector groups in the survey were paid Pounds 99,112.
More than a third of chief executives have a notice period of three years or
more, and more than half the directors have a notice period of at least a
year.
The average basic salary received by directors increased by 6.2 per cent in
the 12 months to July 1993. Only 270 received no in-crease.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Watchdog deplores state of nuclear stores
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's nuclear safety watchdog has urged ministers to clear
obstacles in the way of creating the UK's first safe underground disposal
site for nuclear waste.
Delays in creating the disposal site at Sellafield in Cumbria mean that
nuclear waste is being stored in 'unsatisfactory' and 'deteriorating'
conditions at power stations and other nuclear installations, according to
the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Nuclear Installations.
Professor John Horlock, the committee's departing chairman, has asked Mr Tim
Eggar, the energy minister, to throw his weight behind efforts to establish
the nuclear waste store before 2010. In a letter leaked to Greenpeace, the
environmental group, Prof Horlock identifies 'unnecessary planning hurdles'
as a particular obstacle to progress.
The new store is due to be opened in 2007 by UK Nirex, the nuclear
industry's waste disposal company. But Prof Horlock casts doubt on whether
it can be opened before 2010 'or even within a few years of that date'.
His letter, sent in August, also calls for action to agree how nuclear waste
should be kept until the new store opens. It says the nuclear companies
which now store the waste are reluctant to take 'early steps to put the
waste into safer condition' in case it has to be repackaged before transfer
to the Sellafield site.
Prof Horlock warns that the delays in opening the site and agreeing on
repackaging the waste are 'producing a situation in which safety at nuclear
sites could be compromised . . .'
The Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday that the Health and
Safety Executive, the parent body of the advisory committee, had the power
to insist that nuclear waste is repackaged if necessary.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE European Community should stop introducing laws and regulations over a
wide range of labour issues, the Engineering Employers Federation says in a
submission to be presented in Brussels today, Robert Taylor writes.
The EC should stay away from collective labour legislation, worker
consultation and participation, working hours, job content, contracts of
employment, annual leave and industrial relations and procedures, it says.
'The future direction of European social policy must be about encouraging
business competitiveness and job creation,' it adds.
EC social policy should concentrate on training, labour mobility and the
creation of cross-border employment services, it concludes.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Allure of the company car as strong as ever
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ALLURE of the company car is not fading as far as the captains of
British industry are concerned.
In spite of the reduction of tax benefits, 19 out of every 20 company
directors surveyed drives a company car, with the average cost of the
benefit being Pounds 10,863. Few directors opt for the cash alternative,
choosing instead from 37 separate car makes - most of them fast luxury
models. About a sixth of the total - 255 directors - drive BMWs, 254 drive
Jaguars or Daimlers, and 145 favour Mercedes. Perhaps surprisingly, only one
director has a Porsche and only two directors - both chief executives - opt
for a Rolls-Royce.
The average age of the male directors surveyed is 47. Only 50 of the
directors are women, with just two of the 222 companies in the survey
employing women as their chief executives. The average total package
received by women amounted to Pounds 91,531, compared with the Pounds
157,017 received by male executives.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Mayhew tells Hume to suspend talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROGRESS in round-table talks about the future of Northern Ireland would
become easier if the Hume-Adams initiative were suspended, Sir Patrick
Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said yesterday.
A dialogue between Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour
party, and Mr Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, opened last month and has
been given a cautious welcome by the government of the Irish Republic.
But the initiative has led the Democratic Unionist party to rule out further
participation in the round-table talks promoted by the UK government.
Sir Patrick said: 'To the extent that Mr Hume's talks have been seen as an
obstacle to the continuance of the previous round of talks, it would be a
good thing if those talks remained suspended because an obstacle would then
be removed.'

FT  11 OCT 93 / Greater accountability urged for quangos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOARD members of quangos, the unelected organisations that provide many
public services, should become more accountable, says a study published by a
local-government think tank, John Willman writes.
The study by Professor John Stewart and Mr Howard Davis of Birmingham
University calls for a code of practice to increase the accountability of
quangos, which have taken over areas previously provided by local
authorities such as health services.
This would include giving details of the membership of their boards, which
are appointed by ministers and are supposed to be accountable to parliament,
as well as details of their backgrounds and their political allegiances.
Quangos might also be required to hold meetings in public, and to provide
greater access to information about their workings.
The study recommends that quangos should become accountable to their local
communities through some form of elections. An alternative would be to make
them accountable to elected local authorities.
Yet, says the study, their existence and membership are often shrouded in
secrecy.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Government is warned over fragile recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC RECOVERY is fragile and the government should act with caution if
it raises taxes in the November Budget, two reports published today warn.
Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information company, found confidence about
sales prospects had increased among managing directors for the fourth
consecutive quarter. But this was offset by falls in profit and export
expectations over the past six months.
The Ernst &amp; Young Item Club, the independent economic forecaster, expects
growth to accelerate to 2.6 per cent in 1994 from 1.7 per cent this year but
says 'significant risks' surround the outlook. It warns that further sharp
tax increases of Pounds 10bn spread over several Budgets would risk higher
inflation and lower growth in the middle of the 1990s.
The Dun &amp; Bradstreet poll of 1,745 managing directors between September 9
and 21 found that 37.2 per cent favoured lower spending on public services
to correct the Budget deficit against 25.7 per cent advocating higher
indirect taxation and 24.2 per cent in favour of higher direct taxes.
Mr Philip Mellor, Dun &amp; Bradstreet's marketing manager, said the survey
suggested that Britain's economic recovery might be beginning to run out of
steam in spite of the prospect of a last-quarter spending spree this year.
While two-thirds of companies expect increased sales in the current quarter,
against 15 per cent expecting a sales decline, two out of three expect no
increase in exports compared with last year and only 28 per cent expect
higher profits compared with a year ago.
After subtracting the percentage of companies forecasting declines from
those forecasting increases, Dun &amp; Bradstreet said that on balance 51 per
cent of companies expect higher sales in the fourth quarter. Although this
is the strongest indicator of sales optimism since the third quarter of
1989, on balance only 14 per cent of companies expect a year-on-year
increase in profits, against 21 per cent in the second quarter of this year.
The export optimism index has declined to 18 per cent from 28 per cent six
months ago, while the balance of managers expecting new orders to rise has
fallen to 36 per cent from 41 per cent.
The Dun &amp; Bradstreet survey points to little overall change in selling
prices and only modest increases in employment, with a balance of 11 per
cent of companies expecting to increase staff. There is little sign of wage
inflation: 21.8 per cent of managers forecast no change in wage levels over
the coming year while 26.6 per cent predicted increases of 1 per cent to 2
per cent, and 37.1 per cent increases of 2 per cent to 4 per cent. Only 14.5
per cent said they would give pay rises of more than 4 per cent.
The Item Club, which uses the Treasury economic model to make its forecasts,
says growth is likely to settle back to 2.4 per cent by 1995 and 2.2 per
cent by 1996. The recovery will, however, generate new jobs from next year
and will push unemployment below 2.75m by the middle of the year.
It expects the public sector borrowing requirement for 1993-94 will be
Pounds 2bn below the March Budget forecast of Pounds 50bn.
Item's central forecast, which envisages net fiscal tightening of Pounds
3.5bn in November, puts the 1994-95 PSBR at Pounds 38.7bn against Pounds
44bn in the March Budget.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Charity tins may rattle to a different tune: Alan Pike
discloses moves to make the voluntary sector choose between campaigning and
providing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN AMBULANCE rushes an elderly woman to hospital after she collapses in the
street. When she has recovered she is taken home to find a friendly
home-help waiting to greet her.
Ten years ago the woman would have passed from one pair of directly employed
public-sector hands to another. Today, the picture is different.
The emergency ambulance service and hospital are likely to be trusts -
statutory bodies, but run by their own boards of management. Trust hospitals
are not charities but they often run big appeals that affect the charity
fund-raising market.
The patient's journey home would probably have been with a private company
or voluntary organisation, to which ambulance services contract much
non-emergency work. Her home-help may well come from one of the charities,
such as Age Concern, that provide welfare services under contract to local
authorities.
And if the patient has to enter residential care, it will probably be with
the private or voluntary sector.
Welfare services are now delivered by a mixed economy of quangos, private
providers and charities operating public contracts in an increasingly
fragmented social market.
Initially, charity directors and trustees felt uncomfortable about their
role in this new, ill-defined market. Some argued that reliance on public
contracts would lead to charities losing their independence, distinctiveness
and freedom to campaign, and might eventually undermine charitable status
itself.
A report by three former Home Office advisers to be published tomorrow will
confirm their worst fears. It argues that charities delivering public
services are no longer voluntary organisations in the traditional sense and
should lose their automatic right to tax relief. It says charities should
choose between being publicly funded agencies delivering services or being
free-standing campaigning organisations.
Charities operating public contracts would receive tax refunds if they met
annual performance targets, rather than guaranteed tax relief because of
their charitable status. They would join the array of trust hospitals,
opted-out schools, housing associations and private welfare companies in a
new 'third sector'.
Campaigning charities that were not paid to deliver state-funded services
would be freed from government regulation to work for causes as they chose.
But, the report says, individual charities must decide which type of
organisation they want to be.
The consequences of implementing all the report's recommendations would be
dramatic. Public schools, think-tanks and many other institutions that are
not conventionally seen by the public as charities enjoy charitable status,
and loss of tax relief would have wide-ranging implications. It is unlikely
that the government, having reformed charity law only last year, would want
to reopen the issue so soon - particularly on the basis of such a
controversial agenda.
This does not guarantee, however, that the whole report will be shelved.
Although the traditional collecting-box image of charity remains strong,
public money is the single biggest source of income for many service
charities. This is provoking profound questions about the true nature of
charity which this week's report will bring to the surface.
Questions arise from all directions in the new social market. Should public
bodies such as trust hospitals, universities and opted-out schools be
running big charitable appeals, increasing the competition on 'real'
charities for precious income? Would voluntary workers continue to give
their time to charities if they were simply agencies competing to deliver
state contracts? What is the real difference between a tax-exempt charity
that gets income from contracts with state authorities, and a quoted
residential care company, such as Takare, that receives its income in the
same way?
The report will increase pressure on the government to address such issues.
There are few easy answers but one thing is certain: there will be scant
enthusiasm in the voluntary sector for forcing charities to choose between
being service or campaigning organisations.
Most charity directors believe the distinction is a false one. How, they
ask, could leading charities with Christian foundations, such as Barnardos
and the Children's Society, divorce their work in providing services from
the moral purpose of challenging a social order that makes the services
necessary?

FT  11 OCT 93 / Mirror pension fund seeks Pounds 200m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LAWYERS for trustees of Mirror Group Newspapers pension fund yesterday said
they are seeking total damages of Pounds 200m from three City institutions
which dealt with businesses run by the late Robert Maxwell while he was
plundering his companies' pension funds.
Previously the trustees were seeking Pounds 88m from Invesco MIM and
Capel-Cure Myers, UK fund managers, and Lehman Brothers, the US investment
bank. While a Pounds 200m claim is being lodged against each institution,
these will be offset against each other and the total claim is not expected
to be more than Pounds 200m.
The trustees' claim for increased damages is related to their attempts last
week to amend a clause in their writs against the three institutions. This
was a 'whistle-blowers clause', which alleges that the three should have
been aware of Mr Maxwell's activities.
Lehman Brothers said: 'We were not aware from business discussions of any
wrongdoing and will defend our position in court.'

FT  11 OCT 93 / Mail group interested in buying Independent 'for a song'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ASSOCIATED Newspapers, owner of the Daily Mail and The Mail on Sunday,
yesterday said it was interested in acquiring The Independent, but only for
'a song'.
Sir David English, chairman of Associated Newspapers, said on the BBC's The
Money Programme: 'It would be run at a loss for a very long time before you
could turn it round.
'We are interested, I suppose,' he said. But the acquisition would not be
worthwhile unless 'you could virtually get The Independent for a song'.
His comments came on the day the price of The Independent on Sunday was
raised from 90p to Pounds 1 and the paper was redesigned and enlarged. The
Independent will be enlarged tomorrow, when its price will rise from 45p to
50p.
Mr Andrew Knight, chief executive of Mr Rupert Murdoch's News International
which publishes The Times, said on the programme that The Times' weekday
price cut from 45p to 30p had affected other papers more than The
Independent.
He added: 'The Mail and the Express are very different newspapers from The
Times, but nevertheless the top fractions of the readership are very
high-quality readers. I think we have seen a good number of those from the
Telegraph, the Mail and the Express going to The Times.'

FT  11 OCT 93 / Sky 'left itself open to pirates'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SKY Television exposed itself to having its decoding cards pirated when it
closed its security department earlier this year, a specialist suggested
yesterday.
Mr John McCormac, a specialist who monitors the activities of pirates in a
newsletter called Hack Watch News, said: 'This department had provided
intelligence on the piracy industry and prevented a number of hacks. Had
this department been in existence this hack may not have had the impact that
it has had.'
According to Mr McCormac, who has been monitoring the efforts of
unauthorised card operators, pirated Sky cards have been available
throughout Europe since late April.
When the official cards were upgraded to take account of the new Sky
Multi-Channel package, the pirates responded within a week.
Had Sky stuck to its original suggestion of changing its cards every three
months, said Mr McCormac, it would have been uneconomic to try to produce
the unauthorised cards which are illegal to manufacture, sell or use in the
UK and illegal to import to the UK mainland.
Mr McCormac, who estimates that the number of illicit pirate Sky cards and
chips could run into six figures across Europe, said yesterday: 'Sky will
have to come up with a major upgrade in the next one or two months or change
all their cards.'
Such a change would involve a multi-million pound exercise. Satellite
Decoding Systems, an Irish pirate-card distributor with a branch in
Warrington, says it is committed to exporting its pirate cards to the UK.
Mr David Lyons, who runs the company, said: 'Sky is running out of things to
do. We know all the information in their chip and if they call their card in
we already have the information they will be using on their next card.'
Responsiveness to change is its main marketing tool. Although the cards
initially cost Pounds 220, the company says that users will be able to use
them indefinitely for a further Pounds 30 a year.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Financial services activity falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PATCHINESS of economic recovery was underlined yesterday in figures from
the Confederation of British Industry which showed that business activity in
the financial services sector fell slightly in the third quarter of the
year.
A 21 per cent drop in banks' business with industrial and commercial
companies was the main cause of the fall in overall activity, which occurred
in spite of strong rises for venture capitalists, securities traders and
others.
In spite of the 3 per cent fall in activity, optimism about trading
prospects strengthened for the fourth quarter in a row, with 41 per cent of
the 294 companies responding to the survey saying they were more confident
than before.
Mr Andrew Sentance, CBI director of economic affairs, said recovery in the
sector was still 'uneven and patchy'. A fall in volumes for banks and life
insurers, which make up half the sector, accounted for the drop in business.
Mr Sentance said that business volumes were predicted to rise sharply in the
final quarter, although a similar optimism three months ago had not been
fulfilled. Insurance brokers and fund managers were among the most
optimistic companies.
The survey, conducted jointly with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, found that income from
fees and commissions rose during the three months. However, banks reported a
net fall in average loan margins, with a further fall expected.
Operating costs fell for the eighth quarter in a row, with general insurers,
building societies and life insurance companies reporting the strongest
falls.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Can Yeltsin be a democrat and a reformer?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAVING seized power by eliminating the core group of opponents to his
economic programme, Russia's President Boris Yeltsin must now decide how to
use it.
His first instinct seems to be to press ahead with parliamentary elections
in December. But Mr Yeltsin knows both that the state of the economy wins
elections, and that the Russian economy is not in good shape. Hence his
dilemma: delaying elections may threaten his political legitimacy; pressing
ahead with elections quickly may prevent him from implementing the kind of
radical economic reforms upon which his political future depends.
This is a subject on which officials from the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund are required to keep quiet. Publicly, they have
no views about the desirability of different political regimes. But the
combined experiences of the IMF and the World Bank must have taught them
some lessons about the links between economic outcomes and the nature of
political regimes.
The first lesson seems to be that there is no discernible relationship
between economic growth and political regime. China has posted faster growth
rates over the past decade and achieved a much larger rise in literacy than
India, one of the world's oldest democracies. But Poland has managed both to
revive its economy and manage a transition to democracy, neither of which
has occurred in authoritarian Romania. Zaire does not suggest
authoritarianism is good for growth, but nor do Kenya, Zimbabwe or Nigeria
suggest that multi-party elections deliver economic recovery.
A more systematic examination of the relationship between growth and
democracy conducted by John Helliwell at the US National Bureau of Economic
Research fits this anecdotal view. In a sample of 98 countries over the
period 1960 and 1985, he finds that countries with higher levels of income
per head are more likely to be democracies, but that democracies do not tend
to grow either faster or slower than non-democracies.*
Yet Russia's situation is a little more delicate: before it can worry about
growth, Mr Yeltsin's government must first stabilise the economy's rapid
inflation rate. But will elections help? Stabilising a monthly inflation
rate of 20 per cent should improve the lot of millions of Russians. But the
corollary of a successful stabilisation is likely, at least in the short
term, to mean a rise in unemployment from less than 1 to perhaps
considerably more than 10 per cent.
The World Bank did, in fact, examine the links between successful IMF
stabilisation programmes and political regime a few years ago. The results,
buried deep in the 1991 World Development Report, are reproduced in the
chart. Success is measured by the number of years in which fiscal deficits,
central bank credit growth or government spending fell. The analysis
suggests that there is little to choose between continuous democratic or
authoritarian regimes: credit growth falls about 60 per cent of the time in
both cases. But the chances of successful stabilisation were much lower in
countries which only recently made the transition to democracy, presumably
because political allegiances were more fluid and governments more anxious
to deliver signs of progress.
This tension between political transition and economic stabilisation is not
only a dilemma for Mr Yeltsin. The G7 governments probably have little
option but to link aid to democratic reform in Russia. But, as IMF or World
Bank officials may whisper in their ears, that does not necessarily imply
that democratic elections, as opposed to the promise of them, must be a
precondition for either aid or reform. Ghana, one of Africa's most
successful reformers, waited 10 years between stabilisation and multi-party
elections. And, as Mr Yeltsin may reflect, these were won by the erstwhile
dictator, Flight Lieutenant Jerry Rawlings.

MS BENAZIR BHUTTO'S ability to form a durable government in Pakistan was
strengthened at the weekend by the outcome of provincial elections.
Her Pakistan People's Party (PPP) won a narrow lead in Punjab, the largest
and wealthiest province, where her rival, Mr Mohammed Nawaz Sharif, has been
chief minister.
As in Wednesday's national elections, in which Mr Sharif's Pakistan Moslem
League (PML) also won fewer seats than the PPP, he refused to concede
defeat.
Ms Bhutto said in Lahore: 'Although the margin is small, the message is
clear. . . that the Pakistan People's Party and its allies will be forming
the government of Punjab.' However, Mr Sartaj Aziz, secretary general of the
PML, said in Islamabad: 'How can they make such claims? They are still far
from being there.'
The PPP and its allies won 112 seats against the PML's 106 seats in the
province, which has a total of 240 seats for Moslems and eight for
non-Moslem members. The result has suddenly increased the importance of the
non-Moslem members as well as another two independents. Both sides are now
trying to win their support.
Ms Bhutto's party won a comfortable majority in her home province of Sindh.
The PML and its allies won enough seats to form the government in the North
West Frontier province, while in Baluchistan no single group won enough
seats to form the government.
At a national level Ms Bhutto is trying to win over smaller parties and
independent members in the 217-seat lower house of parliament, where she and
her allies have 95 seats so far against Mr Sharif's 72. The house is due to
meet next week to elect the prime minister.
The Karachi stock exchange 100-share index fell 7.71 points to 1,362.12
yesterday, the first trading day after the election.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Talk of plots as PLO seizes its own guards

THE ARREST by the Palestine Liberation Organisation of several bodyguards at
its headquarters in Tunis appears to reflect continued and deep divisions
within the organisation over last month's historic Israeli-Palestinian
accord.
PLO officials were quoted as saying that the crackdown followed two foiled
attempts on the life of Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman. The plots were
allegedly masterminded by Abu Nidal and Ahmed Jibril, leaders of two small
renegade factions which oppose the pact.
However, other Palestinian officials in Tunis said the arrests were in fact
a pre-emptive step by Mr Arafat to marginalise critics of the accord within
the mainstream Fatah movement of the PLO. He was expected to use the alleged
plots to discredit opponents of the agreement at last night's PLO central
council meeting, called to discuss and ratify the deal.
Two main rejectionist groups, the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine (PFLP) and one wing of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, have boycotted the meeting. Leaders of 10 rejectionist groups
based in Damascus, and the Hamas Islamic resistance movement, last week
agreed to create a new leadership for the six-year-old intifada uprising in
the occupied territories and step up attacks on Israeli targets.
Further PLO-Israeli talks towards implementation of the outline deal begin
on Wednesday in Cairo and in Taba, the Egyptian Red Sea resort.
David Horovitz adds from Jerusalem: Two Israeli hikers, shot and bludgeoned
to death in the occupied West Bank on Saturday, were buried yesterday as
Israeli ministers vowed not to let their killers undermine the peace accord.
Two rival groups opposed to the autonomy deal - the PFLP and the Moslem
fundamentalist Islamic Jihad - each yesterday said they were responsible.
Most of yesterday's weekly cabinet meeting was devoted to discussion of the
killings and of an attempted raid on northern Israel by the PFLP early on
Saturday. 'The war continues,' said Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister. 'In
the past it was a war against Israel, and today it is a war against peace
with Israel.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNITED Nations Security Council will today begin formal discussions on a
draft US, British and French resolution tightening sanctions against Libya
which could go to a vote within days. British officials expressed confidence
the resolution would be approved.
This follows Libya's refusal to turn over for trial in a US or Scottish
court two men accused of planting the bomb which destroyed a PanAm flight
over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988 - and their failure to volunteer
themselves for trial.
A 15-strong team of international defence lawyers said after a two-day
meeting in Tripoli with the two men that they saw legal impediments to their
clients receiving a fair trial in Scotland. They expressed 'grave concern'
that any trial there would be prejudiced by the extensive publicity
surrounding the case.
The meeting was part of a complex series of moves which British and other
western diplomats claim is simply an elaborate attempt to buy time and
perhaps stall imposition of sanctions.

<TEXT>
SOUTH KOREA is today bracing itself for the final deadline in a decree
issued two months ago by President Kim Young-sam banning the tax dodge of
using false names for financial transactions. The deadline on converting
such accounts into the real name of their owners expires tomorrow, and any
remaining could be confiscated.
Some analysts expect the financial sector to be thrown into chaos by a
massive last-minute withdrawal of funds from bank and stock accounts by
large depositors - the so-called 'big hands' who dominate the money markets
 -in an effort to hide their money from the tax collector.
This could trigger a banking crisis and cause temporary defaults at some
financial institutions, while sending the stock market into a dive.
But officials discount such fears. 'There is no way they can withdraw their
money without disclosing their true identity,' said Mr Lee Kyung-shik,
deputy prime minister for economic affairs. He was referring to the
requirement for all account holders to provide identification proving
ownership of the assets when engaging in financial transactions.
About 70 per cent of the Won300,000bn (Pounds 245bn) in financial accounts
has been identified since the decree was issued, according to Mr Yong
Soo-gil, a senior government adviser who planned the reform. The large
unverified portion has led to speculation that hidden financial assets may
amount to between Won30,000bn and Won75,000bn, or 10-25 per cent of all
financial accounts.
The government estimates that only Won3,200bn is being held under false-name
accounts. But analysts argue that the problem is far larger because some
account holders have borrowed the names of other people to hide their
assets, which complicates the identification process.
In an attempt to encourage hesitant account holders to report their assets,
the government recently announced that owners of anonymous accounts could
buy low-interest 10-year government bonds to avoid tax investigations and
gift and inheritance taxes. But there has been little response so far.
The government described the bond offer as one way to soak up money from the
underground economy, which is estimated to equal 20 per cent of gross
national product, and use it to revive economic growth.
Mr Kim's administration has been criticised for pursuing the real-name
system at the expense of the economy. The central bank last week predicted
that economic growth could slow to 4 per cent this year, the lowest rate
since 1980, as a result of the real-name system.
The attack on the underground economy is disrupting growth because the
hidden funds helped finance corporate investment and supported consumer
spending.
Small and medium businesses, for example, have depended on funding from the
unofficial kerb market, which is largely financed by money held under false
names. The crackdown has caused that market to collapse and threatened the
survival of small businesses unable to acquire bank loans because they lack
collateral.
The government has provided Won1,000bn in emergency loans to the sector and
claims it has averted a rise in bankruptcies.
Mr Lee and other officials express confidence that the economy will recover
next year as the nation adjusts to the new system.
The stock market index fell by 8 per cent on the introduction of the
real-name system, but has since recovered to its previous level. Some
analysts even predict that share prices could rise sharply as false-name
holders switch their funds to the stock market.
Meanwhile, the authorities are taking strict measures to prevent the flight
of capital abroad, including searching departing passengers at airports for
large amounts of cash or bank drafts. Officials are also examining property
deals to prevent the secret funds finding a new home in land speculation.

FT  11 OCT 93 / BCCI trial opens in Abu Dhabi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ABU DHABI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE trial in Abu Dhabi of 13 former officers of the Bank of Credit and
Commerce International has been adjourned until 13 November following a
preliminary hearing on Saturday. All of the defendants in court - 11 of the
13 charged - pleaded not guilty to the charges which include fraud, forgery,
bribery and mismanagement.
If found guilty, each could face up to three years in jail on any one of the
charges. Mr Mohammed Saleh Naqvi, a former chief executive, is charged on
nine counts. Others, including Mr Agha Hassan Abedi, the bank's founder and
president who is being tried in absentia, face up to a similar number.
In his opening statement, Mr Adli Mahmoud, the Egyptian public prosecutor,
said the attorney general's office had had severe difficulty identifying the
nature and extent of the alleged fraud because of the 'family system' on
which the bank operated, where those concerned were bound by friendship and
personal ties originating in Pakistan. As bank officers, 'they were all very
careful not to give information which could harm each other', he claimed.
Abu Dhabi's exposure to BCCI and related entities amounted to Dollars 9.4bn,
of which some Dollars 1bn may be recoverable in the longer term.
If, as is possible, the private department of Sheikh Zayed, the ruler of Abu
Dhabi and president of the United Arab Emirates, institutes civil
proceedings against the accused to seek compensation for financial losses,
then the court proceedings could run on indefinitely.
It is more likely, however, that the criminal trial will proceed on its own,
in which case the trial could last up to six months.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Yeltsin takes power from local councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin subordinated all councils to regional
administrators at the weekend, in a further effort to clear the political
landscape of institutions and movements presenting a challenge to his
presidential rule.
He also decreed that a special commission would work out a sweeping reform
of local government by this Friday. The head of the commission and its
members have not yet been announced.
At the same time, he extended the state of emergency and the Moscow curfew
until next Sunday. The curfew will now begin an hour later, at midnight, but
will continue to run until 5am. No demonstrations had been reported in
Moscow by yesterday evening, following a statement by Gen Alexander Kulikov,
Moscow City commandant, on Saturday, saying that any attempts to organise
demonstrations would be rigorously suppressed.
Meanwhile, the fate of the thousands of councils, ranging from the
parliaments of territories larger than many countries to small town
councils, remains unclear. But it seems likely they will be swept away, to
be re-elected at the same time as, or soon after, the new federal
parliament.
Leaders of the democratic movements are now engaged in intensive
negotiations with each other ahead of the Federal Assembly elections, due in
December.
The main movement, Russia's Choice, led by Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy
prime minister, is trying to construct 'dream tickets' of prominent radicals
to stand on allied lists.
Mr Sergei Yuzhenkov, a close ally of Mr Gaidar's and deputy head of the
Federal Information Service, said at the weekend he was holding talks with
Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, the economist and presidential candidate, and Mr
Sergei Shakhrai, the deputy prime minister, with the aim of persuading them
to join Mr Gaidar as leaders of Russia's Choice for the election campaign.
Mr Yuzhenkov said: 'Mr Yavlinsky knows the centre (on which he had
previously counted for support) is now too compromised after its support of
the White House and will not provide a base for him.'
Mr Shakhrai, who also has presidential ambitions, has recently threatened to
resign because of Mr Yeltsin's moves against the regions and his refusal to
hold a meeting of the Federation Council, the body which groups together the
regional administrators and council leaders.
He has tried to build up his own party, based on the regions. However,
democrat leaders believe he will seek a pact with Mr Gaidar. Mr Sergei
Vassiliev, head of the government's Economic Reform Centre, said: 'Mr
Shakhrai's decision to go alone would hurt Gaidar, but not as much as it
would hurt Shakhrai'.
Mr Yuzhenkov, the main strategist for the Russia's Choice bloc, said he
hoped other pro-democratic blocs would put up similar leading candidates to
head their lists, so that a number of blocs with similar views could be
elected and produce a parliament with a pro-reform majority.
One list would be provided by the Democratic Russia movement, which has yet
to choose its leaders, and a third could be headed by Mr Anatoly Sobchak,
mayor of St Petersburg and Mr Gavril Popov, former mayor of Moscow.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Tokyo extends an icy hand to Russia: The Kuriles dispute
will dominate Yeltsin's visit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON and WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin can expect an icily polite reception when he
arrives in Tokyo this evening for a three-day official visit.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, will no doubt be relieved
that Mr Yeltsin has at last made good his promise to make a visit, postponed
twice already to the irritation and bewilderment of his hosts.
But once the welcoming handshakes are out of the way, Mr Hosokawa promises
to get down to the prickly business of pushing for progress in the dispute
over the four Kurile islands seized by Soviet troops in the final days of
the second world war. He will also express regret over the recent bloodshed
in Moscow - which prompted opposition calls for the visit to be cancelled.
Although vastly strengthened after suppressing his conservative enemies'
armed uprising in Moscow, Mr Yeltsin is unlikely to be ready, this time
round, for concessions on the islands which Japan wants returned to it.
'It is difficult to expect a breakthrough in this direction,' says Dr
Vyacheslav Amirov of Moscow's Centre for Japanese and Pacific Research.
Seeing Moscow as an opportunistic aggressor in seizing the islands, Japan
has yet to sign a peace treaty with Russia formally ending wartime
hostilities.
Although the Japanese see their 'northern territories' as the main item on
the agenda, a Russian Foreign Ministry official on Friday blamed the media
for 'suggesting that the importance of this visit is based solely on this
issue'.
Admittedly, Japanese officials do not expect great progress on the islands
during a visit which Mr Hosokawa last week described as more of a chance 'to
take Russo-Japanese relations to a new level'.
In a desire to improve relations, it hopes to conclude 15 co-operation
accords ranging from space technology to improving safety at Russian nuclear
power plants and helping to dismantle Russian nuclear weapons.
The most Tokyo hopes for on the territorial front is to name the four
islands - Iturup, Kunashir, Shikotan and Hobbemai - in a joint communique at
the end of the visit. Japan would take this as Russian acknowledgment of its
claims to all four and a step forward from a 1956 communique - since
nullified by Moscow - in which the Soviet Union offered to return two of
them.
Even this is likely to be too much for Mr Yeltsin. Like Britain's Falklands,
these islands inspire a sense of national importance on both sides, out of
scale with their economic value.
If any improvements are achieved during the visit, it will be thanks to the
change of guard in Tokyo. Mr Yeltsin can be thankful that he is meeting the
courteous Mr Hosokawa and not a prime minister from the LDP, the governing
party for 38 years until it lost power this summer.
Despite his more conciliatory tone, Mr Hosokawa is under even more political
pressure than his predecessors to get redress from Moscow for wartime
wrongs. Many people, especially in the LDP, were shocked by his recent
apologies for Japan's wartime aggression and see Mr Yeltsin's visit as an
opportunity to restore the balance.
Japan has been careful not to spell out its offer in return for territorial
concessions, beyond sticking to its policy that it will offer no large-scale
economic aid until the issue is resolved. In practice, that stance has
become increasingly hard to maintain. Japan is now Russia's third largest
aid donor, with pledges of Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.3bn) - of which only 10 per
cent has been disbursed so far.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Europe to speed vetting of rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S Strasbourg-based human rights machinery is to be radically
reformed, under a decision taken in Vienna at the weekend. The present
two-tier system, under which complaints are exhaustively vetted by a
commission before being heard by the European Court of Human Rights, will be
scrapped in favour of a single court, in an effort to reduce the time it
takes to reach a final judgment.
The decision was taken by the Council of Europe, the body which set up the
machinery in the early 1950s. It was meeting at summit level for the first
time in its 44-year history. Nearly all the 32 member states were
represented by their head of state or government - the main exceptions being
Britain, whose prime minister, Mr John Major, was attending his party's
annual conference, and Greece, in the throes of a general election.
The summit also decided to call for a new 'framework convention' on the
protection of national minorities, and 'a protocol complementing the
European Convention on Human Rights in the cultural field by provisions
guaranteeing individual rights, in particular for persons belonging to
national minorities'.
But whereas the protocol establishing the single court of human rights is to
be ready for signature by next May, the documents on minority rights - a
highly sensitive issue for many European governments - will take much longer
to agree. And the framework convention, unlike the human rights convention,
will not be enforceable by a court. It will only specify 'the principles
which contracting states commit themselves to respect'.
Mr Vaclav Havel, the Czech president, voiced reservations shared by Britain
and France when he warned the summit not to 'let in the demon of national
collectivism with a seemingly innocent emphasis on the rights of minorities
and on their right to self-determination'. Such an emphasis, he said,
'inevitably leads to questioning of the integrity of the individual states
and the inviolability of their present borders'.
Under the draft protocol restructuring human rights machinery, judges of the
single court (one for each member state) will sit in committees of three to
weed out inadmissible cases, and in 'chambers' of seven to try the merits of
those judged admissible. Difficult or important cases may be referred to a
'Grand Chamber' of 17 judges. Lord Mackay of Clashfern, Lord Chancellor, who
represented Britain, says he hopes this procedure may halve the time to
settle an average case (now 5-6 years).

FT  11 OCT 93 / Bosnia partition plan unleashes expulsion wave

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS that a plan for the ethnic partition of Bosnia-Hercegovina would
unleash a new wave of forced expulsions have been confirmed.
Serb authorities are evicting Moslems who over 18 months of war have
remained in their home towns, designated part of the proposed Bosnian Serb
mini-state.
Bosnian Croat forces, too, have stepped up their drive to expel the last
Moslems from territory under their control.
In Bijelina, north-eastern Bosnia, Moslems willing to describe the terror
seizing the prosperous town, where they once comprised half the population,
speak only on condition their real names are not used.
Muhamed, a middle-aged teacher who was sacked by Serb officials, tells about
a state commission which rounds up Moslems and forces them to cross front
lines to the Bosnian government stronghold of Tuzla.
'First they check out the houses. They choose the big ones. In broad
daylight, three men arrive in a black metallic Nissan jeep. If you are
lucky, they give you three hours to pack,' said Emira, his wife.
In a store front on a quiet street lined with well-groomed gardens, a group
of tattooed thugs boast that they are the commission's security team.
One man, carries a Luger pistol, which, mimicking the sound of a gun
shooting, he says he will use against anyone who interrupts his 'work'.
He says his commander is Mr Zeljko Raznatovic, known as Arkan, whose
paramilitary unit in concert with the Yugoslav army in spring 1992 killed or
expelled tens of thousands of Moslems from eastern Bosnia.
Moslems once comprised half of Bijelina's population of 32,000. The town was
the first to fall to Serbian control.
The Commission selects 'candidates' for the deportations. In what amounts to
a trade-off, Serbian leaders allow looting of the Moslems as long as they
are expelled.
Fearing retaliation, local Serbs opposed to the newest wave of ethnic
cleansing remain silent. A Serbian eye-witness of the nightly round-ups
says: 'A group of Serb hooligans gathers about 40 Moslems every second or
third night . . . after that they are taken to agricultural high school.
They steal everything from the Moslems.'
Muhamed's wife, Emira says local officials place Serb refugees from central
Bosnia with Moslem families in a process called cuckoo's nesting.
But most Moslems are not allowed to leave. Some pay up to DM500 (Pounds 200)
to 'travel agencies' to be dumped at the Serbian border with Hungary.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Salinas warns of danger to Nafta: Trade treaty would be lost

</HEADLINE>

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Carlos Salinas of Mexico, seeking to end more than a year of
uncertainty about ratification of the free trade agreement with the US and
Canada (Nafta), has said that if the treaty is not secured by the beginning
of next year it will be lost.
The agreement - and related side accords on labour and the environment  - is
awaiting ratification in the three countries but is facing an uphill
struggle in the US Congress.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Salinas said failure to achieve
passage of the agreement by January 1 would mean that 'its chances would be
out for several generations'.
It was 'self deception' to believe that if it were rejected another could be
negotiated soon.
In a statement last week, the president said bluntly: 'Neither the reopening
of the negotiation of the treaty, nor the postponement of its coming into
force are real options at this stage.'
The statement suggested that rejection of the treaty would reverse recent
improvement in relations with the United States, pointedly noting that a few
years ago 'anti-US rhetoric was an easy route to popularity'.
However, asked for clarification, Mexican officials said the government
would not insist categorically on the deadline if the treaty were put to the
vote this year in the US House of Representatives but not voted on by the
Senate until the new year. Support for it is more solid in the Senate than
in the House, and a House vote to ratify would almost certainly ensure its
passage.
That should mean that most of the uncertainty surrounding ratification would
be settled by early December, they said.
While Mr Salinas stressed the 'historic' importance of the trade pact to
Mexican-US relations, he said that Nafta was 'not the only thing' going on
in Mexico, and that the process of economic reform would continue without
it.
Echoing the view of senior Mexican officials who believe the tide in the US
Congress is turning, he said he was 'optimistic' it would be approved.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Italian minister quits in row over privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Paolo Savona, the Italian industry minister, handed in his resignation
last night as a result of serious disagreements over the government's
privatisation programme.
The minister on Saturday strongly criticised the approach to privatisation
by Prof Romano Prodi, the head of Iri, the state holding company. This in
turn produced an unusually frank rebuttal from Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the
prime minister, who stated his full faith in Prof Prodi.
The row comes at a time when the Ciampi government is trying to accelerate
privatisation and Iri is preparing to sell its stakes in two big banks by
the end of the year.
The essence of Mr Savona's attack on Prof Prodi was that as head of Iri he
had no right to presume that privatisation through a public share offering -
the chosen route for the state holding's extensive asset disposals - was the
best means of divestiture in Italy.
Privatisation policy, Mr Savona pointed out, was determined by a government
team of which the minister himself was part.
Mr Savona said it was more suitable to privatise via the French model,
forming a 'hard core' of shareholders in advance to shape the management and
policy of the companies and financial institutions being divested.
Ammunition for Mr Savona's stance was provided last week by Mr Giorgio La
Malfa, the former head of the Republican party.
Mr La Malfa attacked the privatisation of Iri's banking interests through a
public share offering, claiming that this mechanism would fragment ownership
and dilute formal control. In these circumstances, he said, the old
politically controlled management would have a good chance of staying on.
Prof Prodi at one stage over the weekend offered to resign, but stayed on,
having got the backing of the government.

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Bettino Craxi, the former Italian Socialist leader, has suddenly changed
tactics in defending himself against a string of corruption charges. He now
appears willing to collaborate with the magistrates.
On his own initiative he arranged a meeting in Rome on Saturday with Mr
Antonio Di Pietro, the Milan magistrate whom he has castigated since the
corruption scandals first broke in early 1992.
The meeting marks a turning point in the long investigations into political
corruption and illicit party financing. Until now, no senior politician in
any of the previous administrations has sought to co-operate with the
inquiries. Instead, they have hidden behind the protection of parliamentary
immunity until forced by public opinion to waive it.
Mr Craxi has never ceased to protest his innocence and in March fought hard
to avoid losing his immunity. He has been told he is under investigation for
numerous other corruption offences. However, the magistrates cannot question
him unless he consents.
As one of the most powerful figures in Italy from 1980 until his enforced
resignation from the Socialist party this February - and prime minister
1983-1987 - he may be in a position to tell a lot of secrets.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Delors paints future of EC in rosy hues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community faces two more years of low growth. But assuming
interest rates and employment costs fall, it can look forward to balanced
budgets, falling unemployment and 3 per cent annual growth in the second
half of the decade, according to Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president.
In an after-dinner presentation to EC finance ministers on Friday night, he
offered a seductive vision of Europe's prospects by the year 2000.
He was careful to point out that his economic model was not a forecast. It
was more a tool for focusing minds on what had to be done for the EC to
return to the path of economic virtue. As such it provided clues to his
forthcoming 'White Paper' on competitiveness.
Mr Delors insisted that 'Europe is not a mature economy'. The EC needed to
recapture the spirit of the 1980s when the prospect of the single European
market generated jobs and growth.
In order to keep pace with the US and Japan, ministers needed to focus on
three areas:
Competitiveness. Lower interest rates and a higher dollar would strengthen
Europe's position, he said, but ministers also needed to tackle the costs of
hiring labour.
If employment costs were judged to be too high, member states needed to
decide whether to reduce spending in other areas such as health.
Alternatively, they could finance high social costs through other measures
such as the carbon energy tax.
Labour markets. While avoiding specifics, Mr Delors suggested enough
flexibility to draw guarded applause from Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor
of the exchequer.
Strengthening the relationship between growth and jobs. Mr Delors remains
wedded to big capital spending projects, particularly in the area of
telecommunications or US-style 'information highways'; but he also believes
that Europe could create more jobs by marginally lowering its rate of
increase in productivity in service industries.
If member states can make progress in these areas, prospects for growth and
jobs will improve dramatically, according to Mr Delors.
Other factors would be a more favourable outlook for world trade, including
an agreement in the Gatt Uruguay Round; an increase in investment from 19
per cent of EC gross domestic product to 24 per cent; and higher global
savings rates.
On this basis, Mr Delors suggested unemployment could fall from 11 to 7 per
cent, and budget deficits in the EC could fall by 5 per cent in 1996 to zero
by the year 2000.
This must look like a stairway to heaven for Europe's economies as they
struggle to escape recession; and Mr Delors no doubt intended it as such.
Yet the implicit message is that the EC is condemned to two more tough
years. This makes it highly unlikely the Community will be ready to form an
economic and monetary union by 1997.

FT  11 OCT 93 / US seeking 'African solution' in Somalia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SOMALIA'S rebel warlord, Gen Mohamed Farah Aideed, and UN soldiers observed
an uneasy truce in Mogadishu yesterday, as President Bill Clinton's special
envoy arrived to mediate an end to the fighting.
Mr Robert Oakley, the former diplomat sent by Mr Clinton, flew in after a
stopover in Addis Ababa, where he got a pledge from Ethiopian President
Meles Zenawi to work for peace in Somalia.
In Washington, Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said the US was
'going to try to use the African leaders' assistance to try and devise an
African solution to an African problem' - echoing a formulation adopted the
day before by Mr Clinton. But US policy on whether to involve Gen Aideed in
these talks appeared to be confused, or at best artfully nuanced.
Mr Christopher yesterday said he would like Mr Meles to set up an
independent commission to investigate Mr Aideed's involvement in attacks
which killed 24 United Nations peacekeepers, adding that Mr Oakley's
instructions did not include any direct contact with Gen Aideed.
At the same time, he and other US officials refused to rule out
participation by Gen Aideed in peace talks or in a future Somali government.
Mr Christopher said the US had not received the ceasefire offer Gen Aideed
was reported this weekend to have made in an address on his clandestine
radio. 'I think that is just Gen Aideed's way of announcing a unilateral
stand-down,' Mr Christopher said.
Mr Les Aspin, the US defence secretary, meanwhile, said the US was not
actively hunting Gen Aideed, but would not rule out the possibility of
seizing him.
'If a target of opportunity were to present itself I'm not going to say we
wouldn't take advantage and capture Aideed,' he said.
However, if peace talks do begin, it is unlikely that the US would be able
to avoid dealing with Gen Aideed, or at least with representatives of his
Haber Gedir clan. Gen Aideed controls most of the capital, and believes that
his militias' victory in toppling the Siad Barre dictatorship in 1991 earned
him the right to become Somalia's next president.
His presidency would be bitterly opposed by Somalia's 14 other main clans,
despite the signing of a peace accord which halted their warfare in March.
Mr Ali Mahdi Mohamed, a former hotelier who leads a faction controlling
north Mogadishu, is Gen Aideed's rival for the presidency. Mr Mahdi says he
has handed all his weapons to UN peacekeepers, and has generally given the
multinational force little trouble. He may now be hoping to reap some
tangible political rewards for good behaviour.
Most of the 133 Norwegian soldiers serving with the UN in Somalia have
resigned, saying their pay is too low for such a dangerous job, Norway's
Defence Command said yesterday.
It said 117 of the 133, from privates to majors, had signed a letter saying
they were terminating their contracts. They were already were due to leave
Somalia towards the end of the month, and their contracts demanded 30 days'
notice of resignation.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Seeking better health for less money: Some countries spend
twice as much on medicine as others, to no effect
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THANKS TO vast discrepancies in the amount spent on pharmaceuticals, some
European governments are spending twice as much on medicines per capita than
others without achieving improvements in their relative life expectancies.
Prescription medicine sales through pharmacies during the first six months
of this year were only Dollars 46 (Pounds 30.40) a head in Britain. That
compared with Dollars 108 in France and Dollars 78 in Germany, Italy and
Belgium, according to figures compiled by IMS International, the market
research group, and the Financial Times.
The discrepancies in per capita spending were not caused by differing prices
for patented drugs. Prices for drugs in France are among the lowest in
Europe, while those in the UK are among the highest. Nor are they caused by
significant differences in the incidence of diseases or the age structure of
the populations.
Rather, the main differences in spending between European countries are
caused by variations in the volume and type of drugs prescribed.
These variations in prescribing are huge. French doctors prescribe five
times as many items as British doctors and six times as many as their Danish
counterparts, according to a recent study by the Association of the British
Pharmaceutical Industry.
Similarly, the differences between EC nations' drug spending for therapeutic
areas are striking. France spent Dollars 27 a head on cardiovascular drugs
during the first six months this year, compared with Dollars 19 in Germany,
Dollars 17 in Italy and Dollars 8 in the UK, even though the UK has one of
the highest rates of heart disease in the world.
For asthma, France spent Dollars 13 per head, compared with Dollars 10 in
Belgium, Dollars 9 in Italy, Dollars 8 in Spain, Dollars 5 in Germany and
Dollars 3 in the UK.
Moreover, many of the drugs prescribed in high-volume markets such as France
and Italy are of little proven efficacy. A recent Italian survey estimated
10 of the top 50 products sold in that country offered no therapeutic
benefit. The study rated a similar number of France's top 50 as useless,
compared with six in Germany and none in the UK. All but four of the top 50
products in the UK were internationally recognised as effective.
Many of these useless medicines are produced only on a national basis and
offer at best symptomatic relief. Take the market for asthma, for example.
France spends four times as much on respiratory drugs as the UK, according
to IMS. But one leading asthma treatment group reckons the unproven
palliative treatments and cough remedies commonly prescribed in France for
asthma should be excluded from data. Once this is done, the UK market is
actually larger than the French, worth Pounds 341m compared with Pounds
131m.
The UK's National Health Service drugs bill is kept down through government
measures such as doctors' indicative budgets, prescribing lower doses of
products such as antibiotics, and widespread use of cheap, off-patent
generic medicines.
Zeneca, the UK pharmaceuticals group, estimates that 72 per cent of British
prescriptions for its former top-selling product, the heart-drug Tenormin,
are given to patients as cheap generic versions. That compares with 1.6 per
cent in France and almost none in Italy.
Admittedly, comparisons between the UK and continental countries may not be
entirely fair. The UK may well be underspending on medicines. The UK's drugs
bill is also kept low by extremely poor take-up of expensive, innovative
medicines which could be of benefit to patients. This is partly because of
British doctors' conservative prescribing habits.
Glaxo, the world market-leader in anti-ulcer treatments, estimates recent
treatments known as proton-pump inhibitors make up only 25 per cent of the
UK anti-ulcer market, compared with 50 per cent of the French market.
Similarly, the low spending by the UK on cardiovascular medicines is partly
because of the poor uptake of cholesterol-lowering drugs.
A recent survey by Merck of the US showed that only 17 per cent of UK
patients visiting doctors had had a cholesterol test and of these only 1 per
cent were given cholesterol-reducing drugs. That compared with 65 per cent
of French patients, of whom 17 per cent were treated with medicines.
For all the discrepancies among prescribing in EC countries, there appears
to be little correlation between drug consumption and life expectancy. This
is broadly true for all medical expenditure, although there may be different
class distributions concealed by the average figures.
Life expectancy at birth for males in France, the country with the highest
per capita spending on medicines, is 73 years, compared with 73.5 years in
Italy, 73.2 in the UK, the nation with the lowest spending, and 72.6 in
Germany.
Meanwhile, Germany and Italy have introduced measures this year to limit
spending on drugs through eliminating non-effective medicines.

FT  11 OCT 93 / German engineers in plea for Bonn aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN heavy engineering manufacturers need government funds to help them
recover from the 'deepest, most difficult and longest recession' since the
war, according to Mr Jan Kleinewefers, president of the VDMA industry
association.
Together with the federation of German industry, BDI, the association was
considering a joint formal request for 'investment premiums' to encourage
domestic customers to invest in new plant and machinery, he said at the
weekend.
Complaining of 'deafness' among politicians, Mr Kleinewefers said he was
asking not for subsidies but for a limited injection of aid and the deferral
of certain tax payments to stimulate capital spending.
The cost of any investment relief measures would be cancelled out by an
eventual increase in tax revenues, he claimed.
His appeal, coinciding with a rigid clamp on government spending, has little
hope of success. However, it seemed to be intended as a further signal to
trade unions currently preparing their 1994 pay claims.
Engineering employers recently cancelled current pay and conditions
agreements in a largely symbolic move designed to underline the seriousness
of the situation.
Mr Kleinewefers told Munich journalists he expected 'real relief' from the
coming pay talks.
Personnel costs accounted for a third of all costs, he said, and could not
be excluded from measures needed to aid recovery.
Average net return on sales in the industry was less than 1 per cent this
year, the lowest for 40 years.
Only 75 per cent of capacity was in use, the lowest proportion since 1967.
Employers in the west of the country had cut 200,000 jobs since 1991, while
output had fallen 15 per cent. Domestic orders had fallen 17 per cent in the
first eight months of this year and foreign demand was down 4 per cent.
'There are still no clear signs of recovery. The turning point in the
recession is still to come.'

FT  11 OCT 93 / Craxi to help in probe
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Bettino Craxi, the former Italian Socialist leader, has suddenly changed
tactics in defending himself against a string of corruption charges. He now
appears willing to collaborate with the magistrates.
On his own initiative he arranged a meeting in Rome on Saturday with Mr
Antonio Di Pietro, the Milan magistrate whom he has constantly castigated
since the corruption scandals first broke in early 1992.
The meeting marks a turning point in the long investigations into political
corruption and illicit party financing. Until now, no senior politician in
any of the previous administrations has sought to co-operate with the
inquiries. Instead, they have hidden behind the protection of parliamentary
immunity until forced by public opinion to waive it.
Mr Craxi has never ceased to protest his innocence and in March fought hard
to avoid losing his immunity.
He waived it, only to face the two more minor charges linked to illicit
party financing, while his parliamentary colleagues refused to let him face
the more serious charges of extortion and receiving illicitly obtained
money.
Milan magistrates are appealing against the constitutionality of
parliament's right to prevent him facing these charges, which related to the
alleged raising of nearly L40bn (Pounds 17m). Meanwhile, Mr Craxi, Italy's
prime minister from 1983 to 1987, has been advised that he is under
investigation for numerous other corruption offences. However, the
magistrates cannot question him unless he consents.
As one of the most powerful figures in Italy from 1980 until his enforced
resignation from the Socialist party this February, the former premier may
be in a position to tell a lot of secrets.

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S Green party, the sole established political party still increasing
its support in the polls, voted at the weekend to disarm and eventually
abolish the Bundeswehr, the German armed forces. A special conference in
Bonn also rejected by a large majority any move to send German troops abroad
as part of military peace-keeping or peace-making operations.
Thus the Greens, who may well be a candidate for membership of the next
government if they continue to pick up votes from the main parties, remain
solidly committed to their pacifist traditions. By going so far as to call
for abolition of the Bundeswehr, the party is likely to scare off
middle-of-the-road members of the Social Democrats (SPD) doubtful about the
wisdom of a coalition with the Greens.
The SPD is currently negotiating a 'red-green' coalition for the city
parliament in Hamburg, where the party lost its overall majority last month.
The Greens almost doubled their vote to more than 13 per cent. The city's
SPD leadership is deeply divided on the issue, and voted by a bare 13-11
majority on Friday to pursue negotiations. Mayor Henning Voscherau argues
that Green policies on economic development, housing, law and order and the
environment may prevent the SPD pursuing effective policies on the key
issues likely to decide next year's national elections.
Confirmation of the Greens' pacifism is likely to reinforce similar doubts
in the national SPD leadership. However, a continuing strong performance by
the party might make a red-green coalition for the next Bonn government a
genuine option, with a clear left-wing bias.

officials ended with a consensus that the wider fluctuation bands in the ERM
will remain in place for the foreseeable future.
The agreement that the old ERM will remain unworkable for a time was the
main conclusion of a two-day assessment of the consequences of the August 2
European currency crisis.
That led to the de facto suspension of the ERM through the introduction of
15 per cent currency fluctuation bands.
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the Commission, warned ministers meeting in
Genval, near Brussels, that the European economy faced low growth and high
unemployment until 1996. Although Europe remained capable of a strong
rebound, a recovery depended on a fall in EC interest rates, lower
employment costs and a stronger dollar.
The sober outlook for the EC economies emerged along with signs that the
European Commission has abandoned hopes that a 'hard core' of currencies
built around the D-Mark might be ready for economic and monetary union by
1997.
The ministers, central bank governors and senior Treasury officials rallied
behind the goal of greater economic 'convergence' on inflation, budget
deficits and interest rates as the precondition for a single European
currency.
But the UK, France and Germany resisted efforts by the Commission to set
specific performance targets to measure the success of their efforts to
return to convergence.
The 'Big Three' told Mr Henning Christophersen, EC economics commissioner,
that they could support only general guidelines on convergence at the EC
summit in Brussels in December.
Their resistance set back hopes in Brussels that the Commission might be
able to use the impending ratification of the Maastricht treaty to draw
member states into a more formal co-operation on macro-economic policy.
Ministers appeared anxious to avoid the recrimination that has bedevilled
relations in the past 12 months, and steered clear of earlier suggestions
that capital controls should be considered as a means of strengthening the
ERM against speculators.
Mr Philippe Maystadt, the Belgian finance minister, said he was still
convinced of the need to reinforce the ERM. 'But we also think there are
some preconditions to be met before we talk of a return to narrow margins,
and one of those is greater convergence.'
In an effort to shore up the credibility of the Emu project, ministers
expressed support for the introduction by the end of the year of the
national legislation for Emu to take effect.
The legislation would allow Emu 'stage two' to begin on time on January 1
1994; and it would create the European Monetary Institute, the precursor of
the European central bank.
The legislation would ban governments from borrowing indirectly from central
banks; bar privileged access by governments to financial institutions;
encourage governments to rein in excessive budget deficits and debt; and set
out the various contributions of central banks to the EMI.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Russia puts a price on ultimate MiG flight of fancy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
HAS THE child within you always hankered after being a fighter pilot? In one
of the most bizarre instances yet of Russia's appetite for foreign currency,
tourists are to be allowed to fly supersonic sorties over Moscow in Russian
warplanes - at a price.
While strafing the Russian capital will not normally form part of the deal,
anyone with at least Dollars 5,895 (Pounds 3,900) to spare can choose from a
range of packages that will put them at the controls of jet fighters
including the MiG 29 over Russia at speeds of up to 2 1/2 times the speed of
sound.
The more expensive packages, such as the Dollars 13,845 Military Adventure
Programme, include add-ons such as the opportunity to operate and fire a
Kalashnikov assault rifle, a rocket-propelled grenade launcher and a T80
turbine-powered tank on a St Petersburg firing range.
At the top of the range is the Dollars 45,000 Ultimate Flight Programme, in
which the tourist and their partner are trained in aerial combat. The
programme ends with a dogfight, the winner receiving a silver-plated 'Top
Gun' helmet signed by all the MiG test pilots at Zhukovsky air base.
The packages are being offered to western tourists through a newly formed
company called MiGs Etc, based in Sarasota, Florida. Its founder is
30-year-old Mr Kent Ertugrul, a flying enthusiast until recently in the
computer software business.
The first national newspaper advertisements for the trips began to appear
last week. Since then, MiGs Etc says, its telephones have not stopped
ringing.'
Mr Ertugrul said he had the idea during a visit to Moscow when he found that
the Russians had been selling military flights to the public on a small
scale for a year or more. He took a flight in a MiG 29, considered the
experience 'indescribable', and immediately started negotiations to sell the
flights abroad.
Mr Ertugrul believes there is a large market for the tours in the US, Europe
and Japan.
Mr Ertugrul emphasises that tourists will be accompanied by top Russian test
pilots and will fly well within the performance capability of the aircraft.
Even so, the MiGs Etc brochure says participants will be required to sign a
form releasing MiGs Etc from any liability for death or injury. As for
flight safety: 'Although we doubt you will ever need it, you will be given
detailed instructions on using the ejection seat.'

FT  11 OCT 93 / Italian banks agree plans for Ferruzzi restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALIAN BANKS have agreed in principle to a freeze on interest payments to
enable the administrators of the Ferruzzi-Montedison industrial group to
carry out a radical restructuring plan.
If the agreement is now endorsed by the banks' boards and by the foreign
banks involved, it will mean that they will forego interest payments of some
L1,500bn (Pounds 623m) this year.
The foreign banks are due to discuss the restructuring plan today in Milan.
Until now they have taken a tough stance, opposing a debt moratorium.
Italian financial institutions account for over 75 per cent of outstanding
bank debt; the remainder, totalling L6,500bn, is owed to some 100 foreign
banks.
In return for an agreement, the administrators will restructure the group's
outstanding L28,000bn worth of debts, sell off L5,500bn of non-core business
and recapitalise both Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) and its quoted
industrial subsidiary, Montedison.
The carrot for the banks is the promise of eventually recovering their money
through the recapitalisation and subsequent projected profitability of the
operating companies, essentially in the Montedison portfolio.
Without an agreement, Italy's second-largest private group risks bankruptcy
proceedings. The situation has to be clarified by Thursday, when Ferfin and
Montedison are due to approve their half-year balance sheets.
A decision on the accounts was postponed on September 30 because no
agreement had been reached on a debt moratorium. Excluding the debt service
payments will dramatically change the profit and loss account.
It is still not clear whether the debt moratorium will be backdated to
January. This is likely to be a major sticking point with the foreign banks,
if they are willing to accept the principle of a moratorium at all.
The Bank of Italy discreetly intervened on Friday, using its good offices
and powers of moral persuasion to demonstrate that the restructuring plan,
drawn up by Mediobanca, had its full backing.
The Bank of Italy's public endorsement makes it more difficult for the
foreign banks not to fall into line. However, the mood of the foreign banks
is unlikely to have been softened by apparently well documented reports that
both Mediobanca and Banca Commerciale Italiana, one of the main creditors,
knew of the Ferruzzi group's financial plight almost three months before it
became public knowledge.
Mediobanca's plan envisages a five-year timescale, during which net
financial debt of Montedison will be cut from L14,400bn to L4,900bn and that
of Ferfin from L5,000bn to L1,900bn.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Councils face toughest cash squeeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL COUNCILS face the prospect next year of the toughest squeeze on their
spending for more than a decade as a result of the government's
determination to cut public expenditure.
Ministers believe the Department of the Environment will be unable to
achieve any increase at all in the Pounds 41.17bn the government has
estimated councils in England should spend in the current year, and that the
department will be lucky even to avoid a reduction in that amount.
Despite increasingly tight limits on how much local authorities can spend on
services, councils are already spending more than the government's
estimates.
Local-authority leaders will tomorrow use a meeting of the consultative
council on local-government finance to press Mr John Gummer, the environment
secretary, about next year's spending. They plan to show that even following
the government's lead in resisting pay rises unless they are accompanied by
productivity increases, councils cannot set budgets at this year's levels
without severe cuts in services.
Spending on local-authority services rose consistently through the 1980s and
into the 1990s, partly because of the introduction and then the demise of
the poll tax, which was replaced by the council tax.
Based mainly on property values, the council tax was introduced in April
this year largely without the antagonism the poll tax attracted, taking much
of the heat out of local finance.
Ministers therefore feel more confident in imposing stringent limits on
local spending, especially as the reductions in services forecast by local
authorities as a result of the settlement for this year have failed to
become a politically controversial issue.
Local-government officials admit that even sympathetic DoE officials are not
convinced councils had a difficult time setting budgets within this year's
limits: only three authorities went through the formal process of having
their budgets 'capped'.
The cabinet's public spending committee, EDX, is expected to meet every day
this week. Treasury ministers are keen to reach a settlement by the end of
this month.

FT  09 OCT 93 / International Company News: General Dynamics may sell off
rockets side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Dynamics, the US defence company which has been aggressively selling
off subsidiaries, is believed to have been discussing the sale of its space
launch business to fast-growing defence group Martin Marietta.
General Dynamics makes the Atlas/Centaur family of vehicles, powered by
liquid fuels, while Martin Marietta makes Titans, which have a much larger
lifting capacity and are powered primarily by solid fuels.
A deal would be the latest in a series between contractors as the US defence
industry consolidates against a background of a shrinking Pentagon budget
and the end of the Cold War.
Both companies declined to comment on reports of the possible sale, which
first appeared yesterday in Aerospace Daily, an industry newsletter.
However, industry sources suggested that discussions had been going on.
General Dynamics shares rose strongly on the reports to close at Dollars 97
3/4 , up Dollars 1 1/2 , while Martin Marietta was unchanged at Dollars 42
1/4 .
Mr Norman Augustine, chairman of Martin Marietta, said last week the company
was looking for more acquisitions, following its purchase of General
Electric's aerospace division for Dollars 3bn last April.
Both the US Air Force and the NASA, the space agency, have signalled they
would be happy to see a consolidation of the launch vehicle industry, which
could lower costs and increase efficiencies.
Analysts suggested that a deal would help both companies. Martin Marietta
would enjoy a broader technology base and elimination of duplicated
functions, such as research and development.
For General Dynamics, a deal at the right price would fit with its strategy
of buying or selling businesses to cope with the declining defence market,
and returning any spare cash to shareholders.

FT  09 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Thatcher wins bar on book
extracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR DAVID NAPLEY, Baroness Thatcher's solicitor, last night said he had
obtained a High Court injunction against the Mail On Sunday to prevent the
paper publishing extracts from the former prime minister's memoirs, Raymond
Snoddy writes.
The injunction is the latest legal action surrounding The Downing Street
Years, due to be published on Monday week. The Sunday Times begins
serialising the controversial 800-page book tomorrow.
Earlier this week the Daily Mirror published extensive information from the
book and successfully fought off legal attempts by the Sunday Times to
prevent them doing so.
The Mirror on Thursday gave an undertaking not to publish further material
from the book.
The Mail On Sunday declined to comment last night and it is unclear whether
the paper plans to try and get the injunction lifted today.

<TEXT>
IRAQ yesterday gave Mr Rolf Ekeus, the chief United Nations weapons
inspector, a long sought-after list of foreign suppliers for its ballistic
missile, chemical and nuclear weapons programs, AP reports from Bahrain.
Mr Ekeus, a Swedish disarmament expert overseeing Iraq's destruction of
non-conventional weapons, confirmed the handover on arrival in Bahrain after
an eight-day mission in Baghdad. His talks with Iraqi leaders were
considered crucial to Iraqi requests to lift the UN oil embargo.
Mr Ekeus said there had been 'considerable progress' on Iraqi compliance
with other long-standing demands contained in Gulf war ceasefire
resolutions, but Iraq continued to balk at open acknowledgement of Security
Council Resolution 715, which is one of the conditions set by the council
for lifting the embargo.
The resolution calls for long-term monitoring to ensure Iraq does not try to
revive the nuclear, chemical and biological weapons as well as long-range
missiles prohibited after the war.
Mr Ekeus, chairman of the inspectors' UN Special Commission, said there had
been 'hardly any progress' on this score because Iraq considered the
resolution an infringement of its sovereignty.

Another three US soldiers are still missing after Sunday night's fighting
which also killed a Malaysian peace-keeper and wounded 77 Americans.
UN forces yesterday broadcast a message of hope to the missing in case they

BOSNIA'S President Alija Izetbegovic and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman
yesterday issued a joint call for Nato to send peacekeeping troops to their
republics, Reuter reports. They were addressing a news conference in Vienna
after inconclusive peace talks in the Austrian capital.
It was not clear if they intended Nato to supplement or replace the current
UN peacekeeping mission.
Talks between Croats and Moslems made more progress in Zagreb, where the
International Red Cross confirmed that the Bosnian government army and
Croatian military forces had agreed in principle to free more than 5,000
prisoners of war.
UN military officials expressed alarm about renewed fighting in Bosnia. They
said clashes were reaching a 'disturbing' level. 'What we are concerned
about is it building up again to a significant conflict,' said Colonel Bill
Aikman.
The UN High Commissioner for Refugees suspended the evacuation of sick and
wounded from Bosnia, accusing the warring parties of manipulating the
operation for political ends. Saying the situation was 'more alarming than
ever' Mrs Sadako Ogata, launched a Dollars 700m appeal to fund humanitarian
operations in former Yugoslavia until June next year. She said her agency
expected to look after almost 4.3m people over the coming months.

THE United Nations yesterday launched an appeal for nearly Dollars 700m
(Pounds 463m) to feed and shelter 4.26m people in former Yugoslavia between
now and next June, writes Frances Williams.
Mrs Sadako Ogata, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said some 2.74m
people in Bosnia - 1.1m more than last year - would need help to get through
the winter, but repeated earlier warnings that 'without peace, the
humanitarian relief effort will be unable to avert catastrophe'.
Mrs Ogata added: 'With fighting and ethnic cleansing continuing, never has
there been so much intolerance and misery in the region.'
The responsibility for the agony in Bosnia lay with the political and
military leaders. No amount of humanitarian assistance could overcome this
stark reality, she said.
Bosnian Serbs have agreed to allow the UNHCR to send relief convoys this
weekend to Maglaj and Tesanj, two besieged Moslem enclaves cut off from aid
supplies for more than 100 days, the UN said yesterday, Reuter reports from
Geneva.

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO TRAVEL without a bodyguard is wonderful, said Margaret Anstee as she
jetted off to her mud-brick house on the shores of Lake Titicaca.
Why should a 67-year-old Englishwoman retire to live alone among the Aymara
Indians 4,000 ft up in the Andes? It's a character out of Evelyn Waugh, I
said.
She laughed girlishly: 'Oh, please]', but added: 'Well, it is slightly mad.'
The path to her Bolivian Shangri La has been extraordinary. It began in a
village in Essex, traversed some of the world's worst trouble spots and
disaster areas, and ascended almost to the summit of the United Nations. Her
last assignment for the UN, which ended in June, was the globe's bloodiest
conflict - Angola.
This week she landed in Bolivia from Williamsburg, Virginia, where she was
awarded the Reves Prize for her contribution to world peace. She moves in to
the adobe house next week.
At first she resisted when a friend suggested she build on the acre of land
she had bought overlooking the lake and the peaks of the Cordillera Real.
'But it was a wonderful day,' she said, 'and the air is rather like
champagne - what there is of it. So I thought OK, in for a penny, in for a
pound. I also thought, I don't have any children and surely I can have a few
little dreams in my life? And if it doesn't work out nobody suffers except
me.'
I asked: Can you manage on your own, fix things yourself?
'Oh, there are lots of people round about. The only problem is that the
local community may regard me as a kind of billionairess and think I'm going
to be able to do things for them which are rather beyond my means.'
She has done, and will continue to do, things for them (there is a hospital
named after her), has taken Bolivian citizenship, and will act as an
unofficial adviser to the government in La Paz.
'After the traumatic experience of Angola it's going to be very nice trying
to help people to live better rather than ineffectually trying to stop them
killing one another.'
There is nothing spinsterish about Miss Anstee. She bounced into the lobby
of her London club wearing an outlandish trouser suit which showed off her
long, slim legs. She is physically attractive and has a luminous smile. For
8am her make-up was a touch theatrical (she once wanted to be an actress and
there was, after all, a camera to be faced).
She is the only child of working class parents - her father was a print
compositor - from Writtle, outside Chelmsford. They invested everything in
her at a time when money was thought wasted on a girl.
From the local girls' high school she won a place at Newnham College,
Cambridge, where she took a First in modern and medieval languages. The
British Foreign Office had just opened its doors to women and Anstee, to her
surprise, passed through. There she met Ernie Bevin, the foreign secretary,
and, more sensationally, the traitor Donald Maclean.
'I was the last person to see him the night he disappeared. Nobody ever
questioned me about it. I had a very strange conversation with him when he
said he wasn't going to be around the next day.'
She switched to the UN and was rarely in England again but for a year as
economics adviser to Harold Wilson at Number 10 under Lord Balogh. (She had
taken an external degree in economics at London University, sitting the
final exams in the British embassy in La Paz.)
A round of increasingly senior postings took her through Latin America - she
was in Chile during the Pinochet coup - and North Africa, whence she was
detached to the relief operation following the Bangladesh flood of 1973.
Later, from administrative posts in New York and Vienna she was flown out to
co-ordinate aid after the Mexican earthquake, the Chernobyl nuclear disaster
and the Kuwait oil-well fires.
But Angola, she said, was the toughest job. With a limited mandate, small
budget and inadequate manpower, the UN monitoring team she led was incapable
of buttressing any accord reached by the government and the Unita rebels.
Having chaired six weeks of negotiations and secured agreement on all but
one of 38 points - the terms of Unita withdrawal - she was told there would
be no UN troops available for at least six to nine months after a ceasefire.
'What was I supposed to do? Was I supposed to say 'you are very good boys.
Thankyou very much. Now be very good, stay where you are and if you really
behave in nine months we will provide a nanny for you.'?
'A big danger is that rebels everywhere are looking at Bosnia and seeing
what they can get away with.'
Perhaps our hopes of the UN are much too ambitious, I said.
'No, I don't think they're too ambitious. It seems to me those hopes reflect
what the UN ought to be doing. The problem is the hopes are not accompanied
by a true political will to give the UN the wherewithal.
'Angola has some very important lessons for the UN. Member states in a way
are half-hearted about peacekeeping. When it comes to the point they are not
really ready to put up the mandate or the resources.'
The UN secretariat was always under fire, she said. Seldom did critics
remind themselves that it could do only what member states allowed it to.
Margaret Anstee is the UN's first woman field officer, the first to become
an under secretary-general and the first to head a peace-keeping mission.
Her peripatetic career would have been impossible with husband and children.
Was it a big sacrifice to make?
'I think in retrospect, yes. But you were not so conscious of it at the
time.'
You're going to live alone on Lake Titicaca, I said. Would it have been nice
to have someone to take with you?
'Of course. But the person I would have liked to take is dead.' She paused.
There were tears in her eyes. 'He died . . . in January, '91.'
She was referring to Sir Robert Jackson, the Australian born UN
under-secretary she met in the late 1960s and with whom she lived for 20
years. He was formerly married to the economist Barbara Ward.
I apologised for upsetting her. 'That's alright,' she said.
'But let me add another thing. I have also had tremendous satisfactions. And
I want to say this because everyone's hammering the UN. I don't regret it
because I have met many marvellous people and I have had a very, very
interesting life.'
Can women bring something different to the job?
'Yes, I think they can. I'm all for women's advancement, but not in the
sense of trying to ape the men and out-strip them at the their own game.
Governments always had to have their arms twisted to accept me. But if you
proved yourself afterwards, in some ways, it was easier for a woman.'
Because men are putty in a woman's hands?
She laughed. 'I wouldn't say that. Unita weren't exactly putty in my hands.
Nor were the Angolan government, for that matter. But I think there is
something in that.
'Savimbi always said to me 'We have a great respect for women and we regard
you as the mother of this process.' Of course when I said things that did
not please Unita, the wrath turned against the mother.
'Unita radio called me a prostitute, a smuggler of diamonds, a smuggler of
mercury - I didn't know one could smuggle mercury - that I had arrived a
poor woman and was leaving a rich one. And that a stray bullet would find
me.
'Some on the government side said they were glad because a woman would show
more sensitivity to the human suffering.
'These are simplistic views. There are many women who are completely
impervious to human suffering just as there are many men who feel very
strongly about it.'
Margaret Anstee has faced death - her own as well as others. In Bolivia in
1964 her house came under fire because it was beside the city garrison. In
Angola last October a nearby ammunition dump blew up and mortars rained on
the UN compound. There was the death threat from Unita.
'Angola was a pretty awful experience. Chernobyl was awful too, in a
different, very menacing way. To go into this place that was absolutely
dead. It was frightening when you went into the reactor . . . '
Kuwait, she said, was 'like hell-fire, another dreadful demonstration of the
awful things that human beings can do.' Chile was traumatic for the
encounters with torture victims - and the torturers.
'In one week 1,000 people came in begging for UN protection. I had men on
their knees throw their arms round my legs to say 'Don't put me out on the
street.' Every day there were bodies in the river, and friends who
disappeared. It was a terrible, terrible time.
'I think it was a watershed in my life. I had always thought of myself as an
international civil servant, but then I realised there was a little bit of
chauvinism inside me which said to me, when it was too awful to bear, 'Well,
never mind dear, this couldn't possibly happen in England.'
'But Chile is one of the most cultivated places and the people have such a
sense of humour. They can laugh at themselves, like us. When I saw what
happened there I thought, my God, this could happen anywhere.'
Did you start out a bright-eyed idealistic young woman?
'Very.'
And how has the experience of these atrocities changed you? 'How can I sum
it up? I have an awful feeling that we seem able to develop everything in
life, particularly the technology and the weapons of destruction. The thing
that just doesn't seem to develop is human nature.
'You ask me am I sorry I didn't have children. Yes, I am. But in some ways
I'm sort of relieved . . . Yes, I was probably very foolishly idealistic and
optimistic. I'm still optimistic because . . . '
One has no choice?
'One has no choice. Otherwise life just wouldn't be worth living. I don't
want to give a message of despair because I think individual people can do
so much.'
It might have been her own citation.

FT  09 OCT 93 / As they say in Europe: Just another everyday crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOSCOW papers have had no shortage of material in the past couple of
weeks: the shelling of the local White House, in particular, aroused a good
deal of interest as was shown by the huge crowd of spectators it attracted.
But the city's journalists take these things in their stride.
'Today's Izvestia focuses on developments around the former parliament
building,' wrote the Tass news agency in its press review the other day. The
word 'former' was, in fact, used even before President Boris Yeltsin's tanks
set fire to the building so, plainly, Tass grasped the way things were
moving.
The relaxed approach of the Russians and their media to supposedly
epoch-making events is something that has been noted before in this column.
This time, it was shown in the measured partisanship of different papers.
Pravda was naturally for the parliamentarians (and got banned as a result),
while Nezavisimaya Gazeta on the whole backed the president. But even it
thought that the 'blockade of the House of Soviets . . . is disgracing us
before the whole world.'
However, it was hard to disentangle where this paper - its name means The
Independent - really stood but I gained some understanding when it became
one of the first to be censored.
But I still needed the list of prohibited papers, as they appeared in the
official decree, to be certain as to who opposed whom.
The pro-Yeltsin Komsomolskaya Pravda adopted an unusual position on the
banning of Rossiskaya Gazeta, calling the situation 'immoral.' This,
however, was because hundreds of thousands of people had paid their
subscriptions to the end of the year and 'now would not want to read the
paper' even if they could.
Local television took a keen interest in the parliamentary rebellion without
allowing excessive disruption of its output. When the main channel,
Ostankino, had to break into its Sunday afternoon schedule to announce that
a state of emergency had been imposed, it went back to a football match
within three minutes.
Russia's second city, St Petersburg, reacted calmly - the lead story there
last weekend was the 50th anniversary of the lifting of the Nazi siege.
Further afield, the Poles were, as usual, steeped in gloom. 'The shadow of
the dramatic events in Moscow hangs over Poland,' wrote Zycie Warszawy. 'In
this situation, the internal cohesion of Poland as regards unity and the key
issues of sovereignty, is gaining significance. All kinds of inter-party
squabbling must stop.'
If you read the Polish press often enough, you come to see that every big
international story conceals a Polish story struggling to get out.
For the Czechs, it was the media that had emerged victorious. 'Freedom of
speech played the greatest role in the defeat of the parliamentary putsch,'
wrote one Prague commentator. It was probably Kafka who pointed out
originally that freedom of speech's greatest victories usually occur when
the opposition's papers have been closed.
Yeltsin's opponents may have expected to find allies abroad in the old
mouthpieces of other communist parties. This was not so. The Czech Rude
Pravo said Rutskoi and Khasbulatov had over-reached themselves. And, in
Paris, L'Humanite was scarcely more helpful when it wrote: 'Russia is on the
path of third-worldisation and on the verge of transforming itself into a
banana republic. And while these little chieftains struggle among
themselves, the Russians slip into poverty.'
A further sceptical west European note was struck at the other end of the
political sectrum by Handelsblatt. This representative of the German
business establishment said the west had to ask itself whether it had
supported Yeltsin enough and criticised him enough.
This (admittedly somewhat indigestible) collection of comments helps to
bring home a number of realities. Russia probably does not feel itself to be
on the edge of a cataclysm, and the course of events is not even regarded as
extraordinary. Indeed, a nation with Russia's history in the 20th century
would be hard put to define 'extraordinary.'
We see also that the Poles are far more scared of events in Russia than the
Czechs who, these days, are two countries away. Germany is further away
still, but inevitably more anxious; there were few signs of enthusiasm for
Yeltsin's victory there. Typical French opinion was that nothing would be
quite the same again, and that real power resided with the army. By
comparison, the British papers seemed rather optimistic.
The real contrast, though, remains that between foreign assumptions of the
huge importance of the events in Moscow and the restrained vision of the
Russians themselves. The financial markets, incidentally, agreed with the
Russians.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: The plastic cup of friendship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE been on holiday, the last 10 days of which were split between three
Club Med villages in Morocco: Marrakech, Ouarzazate and Agadir. This was my
first experience of Club Med, and it left me mightily impressed. China's bid
to stage the millennial Olympic Games may have been crushingly - and rightly
 -snubbed, but from what I saw in Morocco, China can derive solace and joy
from the news that Club Med is to open its first holiday village there in
1995.
So happy was I in Morocco that I turned a blind eye to the cavortings of
Miss Lee, my Thacherite executive assistant, who accompanied me on holiday
and who filled her days and nights with an intense schedule of tennis
lessons. Like most good Thatcherites, Miss Lee has a huge collection of
exceedingly short tennis frocks. However, it was not the lessons that
attracted Miss Lee so much as the young Arab instructors. They kept her out
till all hours, often till pearly dawn; I presume the courts were floodlit.
Because Miss Lee had her hands full, I was left in peace to tackle a pile of
books. The most enjoyable was Norman Lewis's latest volume, An Empire of the
East, about travels in Indonesia. Lewis is regarded as the best living
British travel writer. He has an infinitely sure touch, and is a wonderful
reporter. Such a marvellous reporter that he has given me a big idea.
The idea struck me on Page 148. Lewis is in Jayapura, in Irian Jaya, hoping
for a surat jalan (permission to travel) for the central highlands. Given
its location, says Lewis, you would think that Jayapura would have been
'full of the remembrance of things past, of jaded pretension, of the stage
scenery of a tropical fin-de-siecle and dignified decline.'
Nothing could be less true. Jayapura has no attractions. Some Indonesians
see it as the Siberia of the tropics. But at 6pm on a Sunday, Lewis suddenly
noticed a frenzied rush to the shops.
'On offer everywhere were sporting trophies in the shape of cups of all
sizes with lavish and often dismal embellishment. The public had formed a
tight cordon round the supermarket's central display, commenting excitedly
on the maenads, tritons and cherubs, before making their choice . . . The
shimmer of silver and gold misled. It was far and away the largest
collection of such objects I had ever seen in one place, but all were of
plastic, although indistinguishable at a distance . . . from the real
thing.'
What was going on? A young assistant came to Lewis's aid. 'You see,' he
said, 'normally these cups are being awarded for achievements of many kinds.
For running like greyhound. For throwing ball into net. For lifting heavy
weight with separate class for lady competitors. Always the purpose is to
encourage athletical success.'
'But not today, you say?'
'Today is special occasion for giving such cups as presents to good friends.
This, in Jayapura, is friendship day. If friendship is big, cup must be big.
Oh yes, a man who receives much admiration may fill a room with them.'
'But for every one he gets he must give one in return, isn't that so?'
'That he must do. That is natural thing.'
'Well at least it's good for business.'
'Oh yes. On friendship day we are being given shot in arm.'
It struck me, as I read this, that what we need most is our own friendship
day. This is a sad and weary planet ruled by a sad and weary species. In
Britain, especially, we are consumed by self-disgust. We look with revulsion
at everything around us, at what we have become.
Which is why I am setting great store by a British friendship day. Perhaps
it will be next June. It is a balmy, friendly month. I am reasonably sure
that Woolworth's sells plastic sporting trophies amid all its other rubbish.
On national friendship day we shall give one to each friend. The bigger the
friendship, the bigger the cup. And we shall utter something suitable, a
mantra as it were - perhaps 'God bless John Major.'
I mentioned my scheme to Miss Lee. It was dawn in Agadir. The light was
milky-pearly. She had just come in from her lesson. Her hair and frock were
rumpled. There were circles under her eyes. I said: 'This is probably our
final chance, Miss Lee. We need a national friendship day. It will prove a
shot in the arm.'

FT  09 OCT 93 / Arts: The price Wagner pays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF IT was a musical they would extend the run: if it was the FA Cup Final
they would charge twice the price of entry for a regular football match. But
it is Wagner. So they restrict the number of performances to six, charge a
small premium on tickets and watch the house sell out.
Last night, Wagner's Die Meistersinger opened at Covent Garden, the first of
only six performances (Max Loppert reviews it on Monday). Even with the
cheapest tickets at Pounds 29, the night was all but a sell-out. Later this
season English National Opera stages nine performances of Lohengrin. Tickets
are selling rapidly. Is it not peculiar, then, that London's opera houses
have not responded to demand by increasing the supply of what sells so well?
This, say the opera planners, is because staging Wagner is an elaborate
affair. Of course we would like to give the public more, but you try
building the sets, getting the singers, fitting in rehearsals and paying
overtime to orchestra and chorus for productions that start at 5.30pm and
end towards midnight. Impressario Raymond Gubbay also has doubts: 'From a
promoters point of view, Wagner is very difficult because the pieces are
long and that inevitably calls for vast financial resources.'
Their arguments go down badly with James Pritchard, editor of Wagner News,
who complains of a Wagner 'drought' in the UK. 'Wagner plays a very large
part in the repertoires of even small companies in France, Germany and
Scandinavia,' he said. 'The British companies always trot forward the
argument that it is too expensive, but they don't say that about big Verdi
productions. I think in this country, for some reason, we are a bit down on
Wagner.'
Even so, both of this season's operas last five hours and overtime payments
for exceptionally large orchestras and choruses are high. Both companies are
charging a premium, which does not look like much per ticket, but which
substantially increases the takings of the whole house. Top priced tickets
for Die Meistersinger at Covent Garden, for example, cost Pounds 129
compared with Pounds 119 for Puccini's Madame Butterfly, also on this
season. At ENO, the mark-up is about 10 per cent.
But with a dedicated fan club willing to travel long distances to hear
Wagner, why not charge even more? 'There are a lot of Wagner groupies out
there,' said a spokeswoman from Scottish Opera, which is planning a
production of Tristan and Isolde for next year. 'But you can't fill the
theatre every night with dedicated Wagner fans and anyway it wouldn't be
acceptable to regular audiences to double the price of tickets over night.'
But the biggest obstacle to staging Wagner is the shortage of Wagner
singers. 'For every 20 singers who could sing the lead role in Puccini,
there are only three for Wagner and they are all very busy,' said ENO's
Jeremy Caulton. Rarity value also means the singers command a bigger fee.
And once the singers are secured, the demands of the operas mean their
voices need to rest in between performances. At ENO, the rule is a maximum
of three performances every fortnight. That compares with three performances
in one week of Puccini's La Boheme.
Meanwhile, the length of the operas puts pressure on rehearsal time. For
most operas, ENO and Covent Garden are able to use their theatres for
morning rehearsals. But with Lohengrin and Die Meistersinger starting at the
unusually early times of 5.30pm and 5pm the theatres are out of bounds all
day as the stage is prepared.
At Bayreuth, which hosts a Wagner festival every year, some of the practical
restrictions of staging Wagner are avoided. The kudos of singing there means
the management gets away with paying less for singers. 'Most singers who go
to Bayreuth are prepared to sing for less than their international fees,'
says Caulton.
Surprisingly, Glyndebourne, due to open next year with a new and bigger
theatre, does not intend to tap into the public demand for Wagner, even with
its own international reputation and lengthy pre-season rehearsal period.
'Wagner doesn't loom large in our plans,' said a spokeswoman. 'But this is
more for artistic reasons than practical ones. We want to stick to the kind
of operas we have always done best.'
By restricting performances of Wagner, UK opera houses have ensured a stiff
demand. But are they depriving themselves of an easy income by holding back?
The risk is that unrationed Wagner would soon lose its pulling power. As
Caulton says: 'The ultimate success of Wagner next to Verdi and Puccini is
never really tested, because it is simply not staged as frequently.' And
Gubbay, who says it would be 'wonderful' to stage Wagner on the same scale
as Aida at Wembley is not convinced that there would be an audience. 'Wagner
might be popular with the cognoscenti,' he said. 'But you know what they
say: a Wagner opera starts at 5pm. After an hour and half you look at your
watch, and it says 5.20pm.'

FT  09 OCT 93 / Arts: Operas from Terezin - Two works composed in the
notorious Nazi concentration camp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVER THE past week Radio 3, in conjunction with BBC-2, has been offering a
short season of music from Terezin, the notorious Nazi concentration camp
near Prague. It was appropriate that a double bill of operas connected with
the camp should be staged by Mecklenburgh Opera at the Queen Elizabeth Hall
on Thursday (as part of the London South Bank's Czech festival), since its
composers - Hans Krasa and Viktor Ullmann - belong to a lost generation of
Czech musicians.
Terezin (Theresienstadt) was, of course, nothing more than a cynical ploy, a
showpiece which in June 1944 the Nazis duped the International Red Cross
into believing to be some kind of 'paradise spa'. Existence in Terezin was
different from that of other concentration camps: it had a rich artistic
life and, ironically, was the only place in the Third Reich where Jewish
musicians could compose and perform. But in reality it was a transit camp
for Auschwitz, where both Krasa and Ullmann died late in 1944.
Krasa's Brundibar (receiving its first British performance) and Ullmann's
Der Kaiser von Atlantis made a stimulating, contrasting programme. Though
the children's opera Brundibar originated outside the camp, it became a hit
there, notching up 55 performances. Ullmann's music, on the other hand, was
composed in the camp but banned, probably for its seditious portrayal of the
demented Kaiser Uberall, and not premiered until 1975 in Amsterdam.
Mecklenburgh Opera, winner of the 1991 Prudential Award for opera, was
making its South Bank debut. Both works were effectively staged on the same
small, sloping platform by the group's director of productions, John
Abulafia. Christoph Baugh's sets for the sparkling Brundibar were cut-out
Czech gingerbread buildings.
The story tells of how the children Pepicek and Anicka (John Addison and
Catherine Hopper) are persecuted by the 'evil dictator' Brundibar, an organ
grinder, but rescued by a trio of animals. The symbolism is obvious, the
optimism unbearably poignant, the score bittersweet and bubbly. Soloists and
chorus were all drawn from the excellent New London Children's Choir (words
in Abulafia's singing translation were admirably clear).
In contrast, Der Kaiser von Atlantis is explicitly anti-war and strongly
satirical - the action takes place 'somewhere'. Mecklenburgh Opera staged it
in 1988; this was presumably the same production, but with a largely
different cast. Gwion Thomas (Loudspeaker) stood out as a sardonic
Cabaret-style compere. Richard Halton made a neurotic Emperor, Brian
Bannatyne-Scott a morose Death, Rebecca Du Pont Davies an amusingly robotic
drummer and Robert Horn an athletic Pierrot, lyrical in the Soldier's love
music. Maureen Brathwaite sang sweetly as the Girl from the enemy camp with
whom he falls in love.
Anne Manson, Mecklenburgh musical director, led the performances capably.
Though Ullmann was a pupil of Schoenberg's, this eclectic score seems to owe
more to Weill and Stravinsky. It is exhilarating but  - given the grim
conditions of the work's composition - difficult to judge dispassionately.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Arts: A Ripping drama - Malcolm Rutherford reviews a
promising playwright
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KAREN HOPE'S new play opens with such a burst or repetitive swearing that it
seems like a throwback to the 1980s. That may be an act of deliberate
symbolism, for suddenly a character enters declaring that there are enough
words in the English language to make swearing unnecessary. Then the effing
more or less stops and we may have entered new ground.
Ripping is a cerebral play, full of ambiguities, but it is not
clever-clever. It does not draw on Harold Pinter, nor anyone else who
immediately comes to mind. Like all good plays, it is physical as well as
verbal. It is also almost frighteningly sane.
It stems from a good idea, not far away from facts. Ripping makes an analogy
between mind-building and body-building. A child prodigy goes up to
Cambridge to read advancedmathematics. She is so young that she has to be
accompanied by her father whose maths she is rapidly outstripping.
The pair of them lodge in a place where there is a not dissimilar menage. A
rather older girl has been a champion swimmer: some of her records are still
unbeaten. In her twenties she has moved onto body-building with a coach who
is also her lover.
The play revolves around the interchanges between these two couples. Tom
Stoppard, who has toyed with mathematics and the sciences in Arcadia, ought
to look to his laurels. For Ripping is also about the application of maths
to biology and the other way round, and it is very convincingly done. The
young mathematician is fascinated by the development of the older girl's
muscles and physical movements. The body-builder coach is a scientist of a
kind as well: he has learned a lot from studying mushrooms.
But this is not an abstract piece. The play works on a level of almost total
realism. The dialogue is in the vernacular, loud music occasionally
interspersing the talk. Apart from the mind and body-building analogy, there
is a sub-theme. Both girls have been pushed into their ambitious positions
by their respective fathers. Laura, the mathematician played by Lindsey
Wilson, has her father still around and fussing. Melanie, the athlete, was
encouraged to take body-building drugs by a father now absent but who still
turns up at her contests.
Only four characters appear in the play: the two girls, Laura's father and
Melanie's coach. All become entangled with each other, though how far is
left ambiguous. The one possible character weakness in the writing is
Anthony, the father of Laura. It is not clear how much he responds, or wants
to, to Melanie's sexual advances, nor whether he remotely understands the
maths in which he is driving his daughter.
For the rest, however, this is a remarkably vibrant play, beautifully done
and precisely directed by Jessica Dromgoole. The Cockpit is a good place to
do it because the theatre in the round is exactly right for the various
contests. (The National's Cottesloe Theatre would be another.) As Melanie,
Victoria Harwood looks at times like a graceful female Atlas, and can then
movingly crack up.
The ultimate tribute is to Ms Hope whose Foreign Lands was performed at the
Finborough early this year. If she goes on like this, we may have a
playwright for the 1990s after all.
The Cockpit, London NW8 until October 30. (071) 402 5081

FT  09 OCT 93 / Arts: Rights and famine - The Dublin Theatre Festival
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE undisputed star of the Dublin Theatre Festival's first week is the Royal
Shakespeare Company's magnificent production of The Winter's Tale directed
by Adrian Noble. Its combination of verve and opulence and the sheer
excellence of the acting had audiences gasping with wonder.
Dublin's Gate Theatre has imported Karel Reisz to direct Niamh Cusack in A
Doll's House while the Abbey's artistic director Garry Hynes has chosen to
mark the end of her term there by directing Tom Murphy's 1968 play, Famine.
Both provide long evenings of serious theatre but fail to generate the
excitement that was around last summer when new plays by Brian Friel and
Billy Roche were staged.
It seems a rather unfestive festival, almost jinxed. A new play by Joe
O'Byrne has been withdrawn at the last minute, as has a one-man show by
Dubliner Mannix Flynn; the only big excitement left in the second week is
Rough Magic's production of The Way of the World in 1930s costume; and as I
write this I am told of the death of Cyril Cusack whose daughter plays the
lead in A Doll's House.
Karel Reisz has come to theatre direction from a long and distinguished
cinema career (Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, Morgan - a Suitable Case
for Treatment, etc) - his work shows the stamp of maturity in its precision
and its lack of gimmickry. Reisz realises that A Doll's House is not about
divorce or the rights of women, but about the romantic notion of self
fulfilment, and consequently the final scene in which Norah leaves her
husband and children to 'find herself' remains as moving if not quite as
shocking as in 1879.
Assheton Gorton's set is a stuffy, over-decorated, predominantly brown
bourgeois apartment with doll's house-like cut out ornaments among its
plaster work. Rupert Murray's atmospheric lighting works in conjunction with
the set's unusual perspective to change mood and highlight the drama.
It is generally the child-wife Norah who gains all the attention and
sympathy, but here equal weight must be given to her husband, Torvald,
impeccably played by Ian McElhinney. Torvald is not portrayed as an
unfeeling monster, but as a kind, affectionate and almost fun-loving
husband. True, he can also be bossy, insensitive and pompous, but these are
not the reasons why Norah is leaving: it is the conventions of society that
she is rebelling against rather than her husband who just happens to embody
these restrictions. When Torvald realises he is being rejected you feel
positively sorry for him. The tragedy is as much Torvald's as Norah's.
Niamh Cusack looks the right age for Norah - late 20s, say. Her rather
stagey mannerisms seem at odds with such a realistic play, and even
apparently impulsive movements appear carefully choreographed. She can
certainly hold an audience, but I missed the depths of angst which a more
intellectual (and almost inevitably older) actress could bring to the part.
Susan FitzGerald is wonderfully self-assure as the friend, Mrs Linde, and
Timothy Walker's Krogstad is slightly seedy as well as sinister. My only
reservation about this highly accomplished evening is the decision to play
the three acts with two intervals.
In fact, the Gate's production ran for only a quarter of an hour longer than
the Abbey's Famine, which had only the one interval. There is a school of
thought which believes that Famine is a neglected classic. It does not seem
particularly neglected to me, having had two previous productions in Dublin
and one in Galway, neither does it seem in any sense a classic.
Famine is written in a series of 12 scenes set in the village of Glanconnor
in 1846, the second year that the potato crop failed. It charts the effect
of hunger on a group of villagers. Some take up the only relief offered by
the landlord, a ticket to Canada. One man kills two policemen, hoping to
start an uprising. Others die or are dying.
The chief problem with the play is its schematic form. Peasants, priests and
landlords all represent particular reactions to events but never emerge as
real characters. It is more like watching a very violent pageant than a
play.
I hoped that Garry Hynes would do something new with it, but alas, no. The
set by Frank Conway, consists of a tumbled down stone circle which occupies
most of the stage and confines the actors to the centre or the wings to no
good purpose. They sometimes rant so hard that they become inaudible. The
lighting, which fails to illuminate the relevant faces, does not help. For
once here is a play which demands historical accuracy and instead we are
given pointless anachronisms - cigarettes, barbed wire. The degradation and
suffering of the famine's victims, the misguided government policy and the
consequent impotence of the landlords are clearly shown here, but they are
not made into theatre. We need a play about the famine, but this is not the
one.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Arts: Hackney Tosca
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LITTLE Opera Box company was originally formed to give open-air
performances at stately homes for English Heritage, but recently it has
discovered the Hackney Empire.
That is a splendid Frank Matcham theatre, of exactly the right size; all it
lacks is an orchestra pit. The company first tried out Don Giovanni there,
with some success (and a minuscule, one-player-to-a-part band.)
Now its Mozart is back in tandem with a new staging of Puccini's Tosca. For
that, Fraser Goulding conducts a Wren Orchestra somewhat enlarged, but still
a mere shadow of the composer's intended forces. The single woodwinds and
lone viola and bass are eked out by a resourceful electronic keyboard
(Alastair Young), which also fills in harp, organ, bells and drums. This
served well enough, most of the time; but one felt for the soprano and tenor
in their most intense passages, denied the trampoline that only full
string-sound can provide.
Those creditable singers were Bridgett Gill in the title role, and Donald
Stephenson as her Cavaradossi: the one strong, forthright and sensible in
her music, the other upstanding and musical - but his experience is largely
in German and British operas, and the voice is not naturally geared to the
shameless, heart-baring thrust of Puccini's phrases (Edmund Tracey's English
text is used). Closer direction might have raised the dramatic temperature,
which remained obstinately mild.
The company seems to have a policy of asking singers to double as producers:
just as its Mozart was directed by the Tosca Sacristan (Andrew Gallacher),
so its Giovanni (Brendan Wheatley) staged the Tosca. This may be a defiant
gesture against the Cult of the Producer, but the result - in Tosca, at
least - looks no more than dim, honest routine.
Terence Sharpe's Scarpia is a near-exception. He presents the villain
straight, as a bloated, baleful toad, with none of the dandyish manners that
most Scarpias like to affect. If his baritone can sound husky and colourless
in recitative and in half-voice, it rose potently to the key moments. He had
properly slimy henchmen in Alan Rankin-Crooks and Mark Hathaway; Ian Comboy
gave the fugitive Angelotti some fugitive life, while the Sacristan
semaphored broadly.
At the end the appreciative Hackney audience cheered the goodies and
cheerfully booed the baddies. That was the kind of production it was. For
jaded regulars like me it was a lesson to hear the score delivered so
competently, but without liquid Italian voices or the gloss of a big
orchestra: no disguises for Puccini's mechanical sequences, nor his barely
varied repetitions of the main motifs. Tosca must surely be ripe for joining
the same musical category as several Romantic concerti: great vehicles for
virtuoso soloists of feeling, but otherwise pretty silly.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Arts: Painting is life or death, every time - Lyn MacRitchie
talks to artist Dorothea Tanning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS sometimes the case that all the future themes of an artist's work are
encapsulated in an early canvas. 'Birthday', created by Dorothea Tanning in
1942, is one such painting. A self-portrait, exquisitely drawn and
delicately coloured, it shows the young artist standing bare foot and bare
breasted in front of a perspective of open doors, a furry familiar, half
beast, half bird at her feet. She wears a purple doublet, and a skirt
trimmed with branches that on careful examination can be seen to turn into
naked female forms just where they should be sprouting into twigs.
'Birthday' did more than set the theme for Tanning's subsequent work. It
also brought her Max Ernst. The great surrealist painter, acting on behalf
of his then wife, Peggy Guggenheim, was selecting work for a group show of
women artists. Tanning had already been signed by the dealer Julien Levy,
patron of the Surrealist exiles in New York, who recommended that Ernst see
her. 'Birthday' was on her easel when he called. It is easy to see why he
made sure he came back. They married, in a double ceremony with Man Ray and
Juliet Browner, in 1946 and were together until his death 30 years later.
Tanning, born in Galesburg, Illinois in 1910, went into training for her
future life at an early age, escaping the confines of the small midwestern
town and a strict Lutheran upbringing by allowing her 'raging imagination'
to roam, assisted by a diet of Carroll, Wilde, Flaubert, Poe and Coleridge.
In 1930 she left for Chicago, determined to become an artist. It was not
until she reached New York in 1936, however, that she found the confirmation
she was seeking. Visiting the exhibition 'Fantastic Art, Dada and
Surrealism' that year at the Museum of Modern Art she felt she was
experiencing 'an explosion'. 'I thought of myself as an artist who was doing
and painting things from my imagination. When I saw that show, I saw that
other people were doing it, it was not proof of a sick mind but an
adventurous one . . .' she told me.
Some of her works painted over the next 15 years have become classics of
surrealist painting, delineating the landscape of repressed sexuality and
desire with a unique authenticity as well as high graphic and painterly
skill. Tanning's dark world, where young girls contemplate monstrous flowers
or mysterious closed doors, or heap on each others' shoulders in delicious
twists of buttocks and faces swirled with tearing drapery and flying hair
seem not so much prurient fantasies as accurate depictions, faithful
renderings of troubled and troubling feelings.
She does not shrink from the explicit. 'Interior with Sudden Joy' 1951,
incudes a rosy detail wrapped in a sinister twist of drapery that makes very
clear the source of that joy the two knowing girls have discovered. This
picture was painted in Arizona, in the little house she and Max Ernst built
on top of a hill in Sedona, where they lived surrounded by vistas of desert
and sky. Conscious of the interior nature of her own inspiration, Tanning
worked indoors. 'Then as now the decibels of nature can crush an artists'
brain. I have seen it happen,' she wrote. 'So I lock the door and paint
interiors.' She denies that her painting are particularly erotic. 'Eroticism
is in all of us - there is some of that in my painting, but it would be a
shame to say that that is all there is . . . They are about the essential
humanity in all of us.'
The progress of her work, and the Camden show includes selected works from
1942 until 1992, is a progress of size rather than content. This progress
begins in the 1950s, when the paint gets thinner and the figures larger, the
nature of their relationships more clearly defined. In 'Death and the
Maiden', 1953, a man hoists a young girl into the air, crushing her thighs
against his chest. In 'Family Portrait', 1954, the huge figure of the father
looms over the table. While the wife is reduced to a tiny provider of food,
the budding daughter presents herself to the viewer, her sexuality both the
source of the painting's tension and the means towards her liberation. In
'Tableau Vivant', also 1954, the begging family dog has assumed a rampant
role, the young woman, how naked, swooning between his paws.
For the next 30 years dogs and naked flesh fill ever bigger canvases, their
swirling forms combined in a cosmic dance of sensuality and liberation not
to everyone's taste. Some spectators at the private view even doubted if
these works were by the same artist. Tanning was shocked by this, but
philosophical. 'People always want to pigeon hole you . . . once they know
something, that is all they want.' She herself has no doubts about her
progress. 'When I look at the early works, I couldn't paint like that today,
with those tiny little brushes. It happens with time, with the epoch - if
someone did that today it would be an anomaly.'
With typical prescience, she spent five years between 1969 and 1974 making
objects from cloth, sewing black velvet fetishes and whole stuffed interiors
with writhing figures breaking through the walls. The examples at Camden are
some of the best works in the show, the skill of their construction and the
power of their imagery striking and fresh even now when installations are a
gallery commonplace. Though she is now too frail to continue to paint large
canvases, Dorothea Tanning is still hard at work, with drawings,
watercolours and collages engaging her ever fertile imagination. At 83 she
says, 'The act of making a new painting is like jumping out without a
parachute - it's life or death every time.'

FT  09 OCT 93 / Arts: Gallery headhunting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AWAITING confirmation on the prime minister's desk is the name of the next
director of London's National Portrait Gallery. Rumour has it that the NPG's
trustees, headed by Henry Keswick of Jardine Matheson, have selected Charles
Saumarez Smith of the Victoria and Albert Museum. He replaces retiring
director John Hayes.
Gossip columns claimed yesterday that waves of protest and indignation were
sweeping the London art world. What has actually happened is that supporters
of the defeated candidate, long-serving deputy director Malcolm Rogers, have
been venting their spleen. They do so knowing that Whitehall's archaic rules
governing public appointments mean that, until Number 10 pronounces, the
museum, trustees, and the victorious candidate, are gagged.
Why is there such media interest in the directorship of a popular but
second-rank museum? The fond hope is that Saumarez Smith, a dome-headed,
mild-mannered, architectural historian, may provide juicy controversy of the
kind that followed the appointment of his present boss, Elizabeth
Esteve-Coll to the V&amp;A in 1988.
The following year, eight senior curators were sacked, the museum's
structure was reorganised, and voluntary charges were introduced. A
lingering effect of the great V&amp;A scandal is that museum people have
developed a taste for press exposure which has earned them the reputation of
the bitchiest profession.
At 40, Saumarez Smith is part of the trend towards appointing scholars
rather than curators, a move not surprisingly deplored by the conservative
faction. However, the definition of what makes a suitable museum director
has become much broader. Neil McGregor's appointment to the National
Gallery, now seen as an inspired choice, was criticised because he had no
museum experience but was an academic art-historian. In comparison, Saumarez
Smith is distinctly less of a maverick after 11 years in the V&amp;A.
It is hard to see any intellectual basis for the petty opposition to the
NPG's choice. The study of portraiture has become much livelier since, under
the influence of the 'new' art history, it moved away from traditional
connoisseurship (asking who painted whom) and into the domain of social
history.
Saumarez Smith has written that museum scholarship should move out of its
'methodological backwater governed by empiricism', and embrace instead the
new interest in the relationship of artefacts to the societies which
produced them. It is hard to think of a better place than the NPG for this
kind of 'new' - but actually, well-engrained - approach to be translated
into exhibitions.
Outsiders like the idea that the museum world is split between
'Thatcherites', men with clip-boards spouting management-talk, and
old-fashioned scholar-curators. This is a ridiculous picture. No one now
gets anywhere near the top without attending management courses. Everyone at
the top realises that museums are part of the entertainment business, and
that fund-raising is a sine qua non.
It is doubtful whether there could again be such a furore as a new broom
caused at the V&amp;A. Noises from the museum world suggest there is a merging
of new and old attitudes, to challenge the crudity of the government
thinking. Last month the V&amp;A, demonised as the test-case of a Thatcherised
public collection, published an anonymous pamphlet. Directed at the
government, it proclaims the essential part that research of all kinds,
including pure research, has to play in the health of a museum. Its author
is Saumarez Smith.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Arts: Courageous writer wins Nobel Prize
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WOULD be a great pity if the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature to
the black American novelist Toni Morrison were to be seen as merely another
gesture of political correctness because it rewards the work of a courageous
writer who has charted new territory for the modern novel in a hard clear
prose that has the resonance of poetry. The picture we get of the lives of
black people in America from a novel like Beloved (1987) serves as a vivid
and moving corrective to the world depicted by Harriet Beecher Stowe in
Uncle Tom's Cabin.
Morrison gives us slavery as it really was, the beatings and rapings, the
cruel use of leg-irons and mouth-clamps, the interminable punishments
imposed for trivial offences. Her account is both unbearable and
unforgettable through her deep understanding of the people who endured this
system. She creates not merely individuals but whole families and
communities and the way they transmuted their suffering into irony with
consistent black humour (both senses) and a hearty appetite for the good
things that such a life did have to offer at those moments when the whip was
at bay. She takes a long-term historical view showing how the system was so
inhuman that it contained the seeds of its own ultimate destruction.
An uncompromising realism has been the mark of each of Morrison's six
novels, combined with a willingness to experiment with form. In her most
recent book Jazz (1992) concerning black urban migration her prose mimes the
repeated rhythms and syncopations of the music. It is a remarkable effect
that appears completely spontaneous but Morrison has confessed to having
re-written passages many times to get it absolutely right.
Morrison is thus as much a craftswoman of the novel as an engage campaigner.
She was born Chloe Anthony Wofford in 1931 in Lorain, a steel town near
Cleveland, Ohio. She was the second of four children in a black family
severely hit by the Depression yet succeeded in completing her education at
Howard and Cornell.
Her first novel, The Bluest Eye (1970), had for its heroine a young black
girl in Ohio who believes she has blue eyes. The heroine's incest with her
father, pregnancy, and ultimate insanity was a portent of things to come.
Sula (1973) studied the friendship between two black women throughout the
troubled 1930s while Song of Solomon (1977) and Tar Baby (1981) opened wider
perspectives on the fate of black people and dealt with the heritage of
slavery throughout America and the Caribbean.
Miss Morrison teaches creative writing at the University of Princeton.
Winning this prize (worth Pounds 563,000) to be awarded in Stockholm on
December 10 is likely to make Morrison's courses even more over-subscribed
than they are at present. It is also likely to give a new boost to the cause
of multi-culturalism in American education. Morrison has emerged publicly on
television as a resolute champion of multi-culturalism in direct opposition
to the views of people like her now fellow-Nobel-prize-winner Saul Bellow
and the historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr who continue to uphold the primacy
of the traditional white-oriented culture. It is an explosive issue that
divides American academe into two fiercely hostile camps.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Arts: A way of happening, a way of mouth - Michael Glover
explains the appealing power of poetry and its increasing popularity today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL GLOVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALFRED Lord Tennyson was very fortunate that the Duke of Wellington died
when he did. It was in 1852, just two years into his Laureateship, when he
was called upon to write an ode on the death of the man who had been
England's national hero since Tennyson's early childhood.
Ten thousand copies of the 'Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington' were
sold to the crowd that made its way to St Paul's on September 14 1852. As
Dickens commented at the time, the nation seemed to have gone 'funeral mad'.
Then, two years later, came the disastrous Charge of the Light Brigade in
the Crimea. By 1862, Tennyson was so prosperous that he turned down an offer
of Pounds 20,000 to do a reading tour of America.
That poetry, albeit of an orotund, drum-beating kind, should have played
such a prominent part in England's national life is quite inconceivable
today. For more than half a century poetry has been in thrall to the
academy, a subject of serious, nit-picking study - but seldom of popular
acclaim. Now there are some telling signs that poetry may be shifting
towards the centre ground again.
Next week, for example, BBC2 is screening a series of innovative poetry
programmes: in Poet's News, a five-minute programme to be screened after
Newsnight every night, poets will be commenting in verse upon the day's
news; Poems on the Box will feature unscheduled appearances by individual
poems between programmes, read by poets, actors and popular entertainers,
including Michael Palin, Ian Dury, PD James and Neil Tennant of the Pet Shop
Boys; and, Re-verse, a 40-minute anthology in documentary form of readings
by and interviews with some of the greatest 20th-century poets, makes use of
much rare archival material: TS Eliot intones majesterially before an
imposing BBC microphone that looks as large as his own head; Stevie Smith,
rocking back and forth in a hammock, and seeming thoroughly mad and
eccentric, reads her tour de force 'Not Waving but Drowning'; WH Auden, face
pouched and puckered like an old walnut, explains how the verbal magic of
poetry is related to other kinds of magic.
Poetry is also beginning to attract the kinds of promotional sponsorship
that literary fiction secured when the Booker was established. Last year the
Forward Prize for Poetry was established with a Pounds 10,000 cash prize for
the best collection of the year, and smaller prizes for the most promising
newcomer and the best individual poet; this year, the Forward is joined by
the TS Eliot Prize, administered by the Poetry Book Society, which will be
awarded in January by Valerie Eliot, TS Eliot's widow - also for the year's
best collection of poems.
Public readings of poetry are on the increase too. In London alone, for
example, there is a poetry reading somewhere every night of the week -
consult the Time Out listings for further details. The Arts Council Poetry
Library at the South Bank Centre, which celebrated its 40th birthday this
year, reports a steady increase in loans in recent years. According to a
recent edition of Cultural Trends from the Policy Studies Unit, there was an
eight per cent drop in public library loans from 1989-90 to 1991-92. Over
that same period loans from the poetry library increased by an average of 10
per cent annually; and since its move to the South Bank four years ago, its
membership has doubled to 11,000.
Yet the most important questions of all still beg for an answer: if poetry
is once again increasing in popularity, what does its revival represent -
and why are people turning up in increasing numbers to hear poetry read in
public?
In primitive cultures, the bard was the embodiment of tribal wisdom, the
repository of the collective memory - and some residue of that attitude
towards the poet and his function remains even today. Consider, for example,
the importance of poetry in Russia in our century. (Metre and rhyme, that
have themselves undergone a post-modernist revival in recent years are, of
course, powerful aids to memory). The poet's current role, in the words of
the Guyanese poet John Agard, this year's first writer in residence at the
Poetry Library, is to 'deal with epiphanies' in language honed, polished and
compressed until words read - and sound - like 'the splendours of speech
newly found'; or, in the words of Robert Graves, the poet 'does a little bit
of magic by . . . putting a ring around a particular experience'. As long as
people require moments of reflection, it seems, they will need poetry (as
was evident in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster when many
sympathisers sent poems of condolence to newspapers) - and this means that
in spite of the enormous changes in the way poetry has been written down the
centuries, it continues to fulfil a time-honoured role: to speak of deeply
felt and often intimate things that cannot be rendered so powerfully or so
effectively in prose.
And yet, it is also true to say that poetry has never had a specific
function. Poems are constructs made of words that are ultimately beyond
paraphrase - dismantle them and you are left with meaningless bits and
pieces strewn about the floor. It merely represents another way of using
language, a way that is often tighter and more powerful than the
narrative-driven novel or the essay; but to define its function is
ultimately impossible.
What is the meaning of music or painting? People find their own uses for
poetry. To some - usually a minority in any society - poetry makes some deep
seated appeal to our questing and imaginative natures; it is almost as if
there is a poetry-shaped hole in some human beings that demands to be
filled. Yet, as WH Auden, one of the greatest of 20th-century poets knew,
poetry is ultimately useless: none of his poems, he once remarked, had saved
a single Jew from the gas chambers; and in the great elegy to WB Yeats that
he wrote soon after Yeats's death in 1939 - the very first poem of Auden's
years of American exile  - he summarised the function of poetry in the way
it can probably best be summarised, in verse:
'For poetry makes nothing happen: it survives/ In the valley of its making
where executives/ Would never want to tamper,/ flows on south/ From ranches
of isolation and the busy griefs,/ Raw towns that we believe and die in; it
survives,/ A way of happening, a mouth . . .'

ANTOINE DE SAINT-EXUPERY: THE LIFE AND DEATH OF THE LITTLE PRINCE by Paul
Webster Macmillan Pounds 17.99, 276 pages
IT IS March 31, 1931. Andre Gide writes in his Journal from Marseille:
'Greatly enjoyed seeing Saint-Exupery again . . . back in France barely a
month now, he has bought back from Argentina a new book and a fiancee. Read
one, seen the other. Congratulated him heartily, but more for the book (Vol
de Nuit, Night Flight, it won the Prix Femina); I hope the fiancee is as
satisfactory . . .'
At first she was, magnificently satisfactory, but became less so as the
years passed. Paul Webster, the Guardian's man in Paris, in his thoughtful
new biography of Saint-Ex quotes a contemporary description of her: '. . . a
typical South American; small and graceful with strikingly beautiful hands
and arms. Her black eyes were captivating, rather like small stars, and her
skin was wonderful'. She became immortalised as the solitary desert Rose
defended from attackers by its sharp thorns in Saint-Ex's charming fable,
The Little Prince.
He had met her in Buenos Aires during an Alliance francaise lecture tour for
French writers. The year before in 1930 Saint-Ex had published his first
novel Courrier Sud (Southern Mail). It was based on his experiences as a
pioneer aviator for Aeropostale opening up the route from Toulouse to Dakar,
and his glamour as author-airman proved irresistible to the bohemian
Salvadorean, whose maiden name was Consuelo Suncin de Sandoval. She was in
her mid-twenties and so was he. But unlike him she had already been married
to another legendary literary man, the Guatemalean duellist Enrique Gomez
Carillo.
Saint-Ex was still sexually naive after a protected Catholic French
provincial up-bringing. He had had one callow affair with Louise de
Vilmorin, yet another novelist and later a friend of Nancy Mitford. She was
the sort of match Saint-Ex's aristocratic family hoped he would make, but
that had petered out. Instead he married Consuelo in 1931. As Webster shows
it proved to be a stormy union, a case of Beauty and the Beast, generating
much acrimony but never resulting in complete loss of love and respect.
Consuelo must have known from the start that she was in competition with a
deadly rival, the air. Saint-Ex was a French Biggles, an overgrown schoolboy
who possessed a surprisingly fine mind. Airborne, he experienced Yeats's
'lonely impulse of delight', was like TS Eliot's 'Guitterriez, avid of speed
and power' and his career might easily have inspired Auden's Journal of an
Airman ('You are a man, or haven't you heard/ That you keep on trying to be
a bird?'). In those days flying was matter for poetry. The pilots with their
goggles and leather jackets, their controls freezing up, and their not
infrequent crash landings, still exert a potent magic, as Michael Ondaatje
showed when he re-created the whole era in The English Patient.
In the course of his flying hours Saint-Ex had several spectacular prangs.
He lost control of one of the early French flying-boats narrowly escaping
drowning. But it was his desert landings while flying over the Spanish
Sahara that gave him his greatest thrill. Wind, Sand and Stars - the English
title of his most intellectually probing book says it all. In searching for
a colleague marooned in the desert, captured by nomadic tribesmen, he landed
on a 300-metre high plateau. 'These untrodden few acres of the world, which
he saw as a table-cloth spread under the apple-tree of the night sky,
contain the elements of the innocent poetry of The Little Prince', says
Webster.
As a writer Saint-Ex belongs firmly to the Right, the Romantic French Right,
though he never joined forces with Maurras or anything noxious of that kind.
One of his greatest friends was a Jewish anarchist, Leon Werth, with whom he
shared an admiration for Pascal. They marvelled at Pascal's prose, discussed
Pascalian apologetics and then played chess together. The combination of man
of action and thinker is an attractive combination that colours all
Saint-Ex's writing. At his best it does have a Pascalian clarity.
His thoughts during the Fall of France were set down in Pilote de Guerre
(Flight to Arras), 1942. Though by then more than 40, he was still flying
dangerous reconnaissance missions. Up in the cockpit Saint-Ex sees the
result in human terms of the collapse of France spread out below him, the
endless streams of peasant villagers fleeing in the face of the German
advance, and he muses on the futility of it all. From his Olympian
vantage-point he works out a philosophy of regeneration through sacrifice.
He escaped from France and spent years from 1942-1944 in America. He
remained however a Petainist nursing an ineradicable hatred of De Gaulle. He
seems, in the face of worsening relations with Consuelo, to have conceived a
death wish and he somehow succeeded in 1944 in getting accepted for flying
duty once again. He was signed on to make sorties on the Mediterranean
Front. Three months later he was dead. Exactly how he died still remains a
mystery; there were persistent rumours of suicide; it must have been when
his Lightening aircraft hit the sea - a death Saint-Ex had rehearsed more
than once. Webster covers the whole of St Ex's career adroitly while keeping
his own feet firmly on the ground.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Books: What happened after Manderley - JDF Jones finds Susan
Hill has made a good job of following up Du Maurier's best-seller
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JDF JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS DE WINTER by Susan Hill Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 12.99, 374 pages
TRY THIS for a plot summary:
'A young woman, orphaned, poor, shy, plain, meets a mysterious and charming
man - rich, strangely tormented, old enough to be her father - and falls in
love with him. To her astonishment, he wants to marry her and install her as
the mistress of his great house. But she discovers that he was married
before and that the marriage has been a nightmare, yet he is trapped by it
and haunted by the monstrous first wife. Under this challenge the girl grows
up - becomes a woman, his equal, his mate - and then the wife is avenged in
a fire and the house is burned to the ground. The consequence is that the
couple can truly be together at last . . . '
That, of course, is the story of Jane Eyre, Charlotte Bronte's masterpiece
of 1847.
It is also the story of Rebecca, Daphne du Maurier's best-seller of 1938.
The parallels between the two novels have always been obvious, as have the
differences in profundity, inspiration, genius. Still, Rebecca is Du
Maurier's best book, the ultra middle-brow, middle-class English popular
novel of this century, a wonderfully good read. It still sells, in millions.
How clever of Mr Sinclair-Stevenson to commission Rebecca II in order to
tell us what happened to the un-named narrator and her husband, Maxim de
Winter, when they fled from their gutted mansion, the unforgettable
Manderley, to take up exile somewhere Abroad.
In Mrs de Winter Susan Hill has made a good stab at a fascinating
assignment. She knows that she has to bring the De Winters home, so she opts
for the funeral of Maxim's jolly sister Beatrice; she has to revive the evil
housekeeper Mrs Danvers, the villainous Jack Flavell, the decent farm
manager Frank Crawley, even the magistrate Colonel Julyan and the awful Mrs
van Hopper.
But her best achievement is that she evidently understands that she has to
tackle the fundamental evasion of the original tale - that, when all is told
and done, Maxim murdered Rebecca: that is why they are located in the prison
of lifelong exile. Step aside from the persuasions of Daphne du Maurier's
beguiling style and you begin to have your doubts about the chap. Why is he
so weak? Fair enough, Rebecca is a prize bitch, but he could have divorced
her, or thrown her out, or left her even for the loss of the house, he does
not have to kill her. (Mr Rochester, you recall, specifically rejected using
'cruelty' on his Creole lunatic wife and instead considered killing
himself])
On the journey back to England for the first time in ten years, Ms Hill has
her (still un-named) narrator suffer a long-delayed insight into her
husband: 'That man is a murderer. He shot Rebecca. That is the man who
killed his wife.' From that moment on the plot is not really any better or
more complex than most of us could embroider after a good supper, but it
will do.
After the funeral the De Winters are tempted to stay on in England; she sets
Manderley behind her and discovers a beautiful house in the Cotswolds, which
Maxim eventually buys for her. But they are both still haunted by the dead
Rebecca. The no-longer-so-young wife wants a baby. In a deeply implausible
plot device she bumps into Jack Flavell ('he was repellent, much older,
seedy. And mad, I thought . . .'); equally absurd is the discovery that Mrs
Danvers is living nearby. Mrs Danvers, the great witch of modern popular
fiction, still terrifies the narrator; she knows that her beloved Rebecca
was murdered and she has been biding her time, waiting to take her revenge.
So far, so good, however thin, but because the story-line is so simple the
narrative has to be heavily padded, most obviously in a long digression in
Italy. Ms Hill is not just a competent novelist but is also a country writer
of true distinction (her The Magic Apple Tree is a delightful book), and she
sensibly uses her skills to flood the story with even more description of
English landscape than Du Maurier would have risked. But shekeeps her
pastiche short of parody.
She provides various references back to the original but this time the
images are often reversed. There is another big party to provide a dramatic
crisis, but it is an informal, happy affair in the garden; the wife visits a
doctor in London, to discuss conception, not cancer; she serves afternoon
tea, clumsily, to the chauffeur-driven Mrs Danvers; she is tempted again to
jump to her death. But there is shown to be a maturing in her character and
a development of symbol: she cannot have a child, for example, because the
old life is still too potent.
One achievement of this exercise, paradoxically, is to remind us of the
weaknesses in the original: the sentimentalisation of Maxim de Winter, for
instance; the unexplained mystery of their long exile; the irritating
wimpishness of the narrator; the under characterisation of Maxim and of his
two marriages. This need not matter in a routine, popular novel except that
this one demands comparison with Brontes model. Consider only, in contrast,
the spunkiness of Jane, the vitality of Mr Rochester (who has to go through
repentance, renewal, transformation - and literal blinding - before he is
rescued by Jane's offering of a glass of water and they can achieve their
true and lasting marriage). My compliment to Susan Hill is that I believe
that she understands this and has tried to correct the imbalance in the
original. She wants to add the missing moral dimension.

TRICKS OF MEMORY By Peregrine Worsthorne Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 18.99,
290 pages
SIR PEREGRINE Worsthorne is usually an exceptionally charming man, a bit of
a dandy perhaps, occasionally over-sensitive, but fairly well-educated and
much better travelled than some of his recent articles have suggested. When
it comes to an autobiography, he has one huge advantage: he can write.
The first 100 pages or so of Tricks of Memory are sheer delight. Worsthorne
turns out to be even grander by background than some of us had assumed. Not
only was his step-father Montagu Norman, the governor of the Bank of
England, a fact which was already well enough known; Norman's younger
brother, Ronnie, was chairman of the BBC. There were good connections all
over the place. The younger brother of Winston Churchill married the sister
of Worsthorne's grandmother. There were frequent visits by Winston himself
to the Worsthorne domain, sometimes with the young Perry in sole charge.
None of this is told in a spirit of boasting. Indeed it sometimes seems that
Worsthorne's subsequent iconoclasm as a journalist was a reaction to being
surrounded by the great and the good in his youth. His mother, though as
well-off and well-connected as the rest of them, was distinctly a
progressive and became more so as she grew older.
Worsthorne's attachment to her in the early years was not great. He thinks
she sent him to the wrong school - Stowe rather than Eton - out of
perversity.
It was not until Worsthorne turned down a place in the City, which all the
family advantages could have offered him, that his step-father and mother
came to take him seriously. From Montagu Norman this may seem odd, but he
was a very unconventional central banker. He went to work either in a
Lincoln, because a Rolls-Royce would have looked too ostentatious, or on the
underground from Notting Hill Gate.
Worsthorne slipped into journalism more by accident than design. Again the
family connections helped, but could be misleading. He went to head office
of the Glasgow Herald on the assumption that he had been appointed deputy
editor; in fact, he was a deputy sub-editor who never wrote a word. Still,
he stuck it out for two years, mixing between fellow sub-editors and some
rather grander Scottish acquaintance, introduced to him through the family.
He did not get on well with everyone he met. When he went to The Times and,
as correspondent in Washington tried to report the Republican Party thinking
of the day, he was told: 'It is not the job of The Times newspaper to
provide a platform for reactionary rant.' When he moved to the Daily
Telegraph and went on the extended Harold Macmillan tour of Africa, he found
that no other British journalist accepted invitations from the Afrikaners in
South Africa. The result was that he gained insights denied to his
colleagues.
Tricks of Memory deteriorates slightly as it nears the present. One of the
reasons is that Worsthorne has always fancied himself as a thinker, almost a
journalist-philosopher. In a fascinating section, he gives his views on how
to write a column. It should not, he thinks, contain too many facts or
inside information, but should concentrate on the author's opinions. Yet it
is precisely because the younger Worsthorne did travel and was exposed to
news that his articles were so good. The talent was to inject some passion
or perversity, but the basic material had to be there.
I do not remember agreeing with anything he has said or written, but his
articles have given me a great deal of pleasure. So does this book.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Books: Does it pass the blushing test? - Jackie Wullschlager
observes the social mores revealed by the reading habits of Victorian
England
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE WOMAN READER 1837-1914 by Kate Flint Oxford Pounds 25.00, 366 pages
READER, I married him, concludes Jane Eyre famously. But who was the reader?
Some Victorian households banned Jane Eyre as dangerously sexy and
subversive. Others welcomed it as great literature. Some critics advocated
the blushing test - 'if you come to a passage which you could not read aloud
to your father or brothers without a blush, lay down the book, it is not fit
for you'. Some thought women should not read at all, but only listen,
'albeit understanding little', to what their husbands read to them.
The Woman Reader is the story of what Victorian women read, what they were
told to read, what they were forbidden from reading, and why. Out of this
comes a history of the imaginative life of a century. It marches down the
corridors of girls' schools, into the tea party in the Victorian parlour,
under the seething currents of attraction in the mixed reading rooms of the
public library, to discover people's hopes, fears and longings via the books
they read and discussed.
Books are a wonderful focus for this sort of social history. In an age
before television, they were the cultural references that people shared and
cared passionately about, The EastEnders of the classroom or the coffee
morning. Ms Flint surveys reading habits recollected in memoirs and letters,
contemporary book reviews, the literary prescriptions of advice manuals, the
portrayal of women readers in novels.
The results show compellingly how literary responses both united people of
vastly different classes and ages, and highlighted the disparity between
them. 'When Hildegarde Muspratt smuggled in Story of an African Farm, just
out, the whole sky seemed aflame and many of us became violent feminists',
recalled a pupil at Cheltenham Ladies College. A Lancashire working woman,
reading Olive Schreiner's story of female oppression on the veldt, said 'I
think there is hundreds of women what feels like that but can't speak it'.
Sex, authority, freedom of expression were the issues in the battle between
censors and readers. Deliciously, Ms Flint evokes earnest middle-class
19th-century England, where literature was seen as a tool of socialisation
moulding conformist, or - if they read the wrong books - questioning,
members of society. At Cheltenham, Desdemona and Ophelia were studied as
victims of their own deceitfulness. David Copperfield and Adam Bede, which
featured fallen women, were thought as inflammatory as pornography. Vera
Brittan talks of 'that intensive searching' for salacious detail through
these books, 'which appears to have been customary almost everywhere among
the adolescents of my generation'. Harriet Shaw Weaver, discovered reading
George Eliot, was dispatched to her room while the local vicar was summoned
to lecture her on the errors of her ways; she rebelled absolutely and as an
adult became patron and confidante of James Joyce. A 60 year old woman
reading Barrett Browning's Aurora Leigh was sure her reputation would be
ruined 'if it were known that she had looked at the poem'.
Feminist novelists answered back. The woman reader is a subversive character
in novels like The Story of a Modern Woman, where the heroine asks her
governess 'what is a lost woman, really, Miss Brown? Dickens says that
Little Emily is a lost woman because she goes to Italy with that Mr
Steerforth. Was Mr Steerforth a lost man, too?' Controversial books like
David Copperfield became talismans in the debate on sexual normality,
women's independence, the suffragettes. Social history here meets political
history; in Dickens Sylvia Pankhurst discovered 'the cause of the People and
the Poor'.
This is an immensely ambitious book which could have been a much better one.
It is drenched in jargon but the writing is dry as dust. I wish Ms Flint
would quote critical theorists a little less, stop worrying about
metasexuality and readers' 'aggressive participation', and come out boldly
with her own opinion. She avoids many questions about culture's relation to
politics and morality, which still matters today, and too often she gets
lost in a maze of forgotten bestsellers and unheard of memoirs.
But other eclectic details - the effect of reading on 19th century nervous
diseases; Edwardian guidebooks like Modern Marriage and How To Bear It - are
compelling. Ms Flint's research is superb, and most readers, of either sex,
will find her books at once fascinating and infuriating.

THE EXPENSE OF GLORY: A LIFE OF JOHN REITH by Ian McIntyre HarperCollins
Pounds 20, 447 pages
WHEN OCCASION demands a hero, and one appears, the whole world gains. Such
conjunctions are infrequent enough. But one occurred when a vaultingly
ambitious, energetic Scotsman applied for the post of General Manager in the
newly-formed British Broadcasting Company. He did not know what
'broadcasting' was, but he got the job; and the rest, in the unimpeachable
phrase, is history.
The man was John Reith. Ian McIntyre's account of his life is based on
Reith's diary, which, owing to its author's curiously powerful mixture of
honesty, innocence, perversity and ambition, is a stupendous work of
self-revelation - and sometimes of great literary merit. McIntyre reports
that he came close to tears at times while reading it, and one sees why:
Reith felt everything with the keenness of a razor, whether it was love,
hope, exultation or despair; and could not forbear to report it.
Most people, however successful they appear to others, view their own lives
as a chapter of failures and disappointments. Reith did so especially,
because he believed with some justice that he had immense gifts that were
never properly employed. Eric Linklater described him as a 'Rolls Royce
engine attached to a wheelbarrow', and if Reith's own visions about his
proper sphere are any measure of his gifts, they were grand: he saw himself
as Prime Minister, Viceroy of India, Secretary-General of the United
Nations. As it was, he did something finer and greater, though he did not
appreciate the fact: he created the BBC.
Reith was the youngest son of a Glasgow Free Church minister. Theirs was a
pious household, and Reith was fiercely religious throughout his life - 'Do
you accept the teachings of Our Lord Jesus Christ?' he would ask BBC
applicants. He wanted to attend university, but was obliged by his father to
take an engineering apprenticeship instead.
The two salient features of Reith's young manhood are his passionate love
for his friend Charlie Bowser, and the first world war. For a decade he and
Charlie, who was a boy in his teens when they met, were as lovers in all -
it appears - but the carnal sense. They wrote ardent letters to each other,
slept together, bathed naked together in Highland streams, kissed and prayed
together. In the end Reith could not accept Charlie's marriage, although he
had arranged it; and the bitterness of the affair's ending lasted the rest
of Reith's life.
The war was a better mistress for Reith. He revelled in the challenge, and
were it not for his arrogance and corner-cutting, which put him at odds with
superiors, he might have shone. But after 11 months in the trenches he was
hit in the face by a sniper's bullet, and took the resulting dramatic scar
to America, where he was posted as supervisor in an arms factory producing
rifles for the British Army. Here he discovered powers as an orator, and was
feted as a wounded young hero pleading the case for America's entry to the
war.
The infant BBC and John Reith were as if tailored for each other. Despite a
curmudgeonly inclination to intolerances of various kinds, Reith had just
the right mixture of principle, cussedness, conviction and vision to create
a public service of excellence. He fought for the BBC's independence,
nourished its growth, fiercely demanded the highest standards throughout,
and after 15 years in charge left it as a model of public service
broadcasting for the world to admire - which, despite the efforts of
wreckers in recent years, it still does.
The BBC gave Reith his stage. Almost as soon as he took charge he was in the
company of ministers and princes, close to the heart of affairs. He revelled
in it. When he left in 1938 to become Chairman of Imperial Airways he did
not realise that he was relinquishing the heart of things for what was, in
the light of his ambitions and talents, the margins, and that he was to
dwindle there for the rest of his days. He entered the Commons briefly, and
then went to the Lords, serving as a minister first under Chamberlain and
then Churchill, whom he hated; but the ministries were junior, and he was a
difficult colleague; Churchill sacked him, and thereafter he growled on the
fringes of public life, fretting at the waste of his hopes.
McIntyre does not hypothesise about Reith. He lets the facts speak for
themselves, and they speak eloquently. Reith was a giant - a modern Magog -
physically, in his talents, in his failings and frailties. There is
something gripping about his hubristic tale; when a man is enormous in his
hopes and agonies he is a compelling spectacle, and although one cannot like
Reith - he is too egomaniacal, vainglorious, domineering, Sabbatarian,
pompous and emotionally blundering - one cannot help admiring him for his
energy and grand ideals.
This is a highly readable book about a very extraordinary man.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Special report on Arts Sponsorship: Hard-up groups join rush
for rich benefactors - How companies are chasing sponsors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS hardly an arts company, museum or art gallery in the UK that is not
actively seeking support, largely financial, from sponsors. Some
organisations - the Glyndebourne festival is the classic example - depend
totally on business and private supporters, and their box office, to exist.
Not that the absence of a government subsidy worries Glyndebourne. When it
re-opens in May in its brand-new theatre, the first production, Mozart's Le
nozze di Figaro, will be sponsored by Rothschilds.
Two more of the season's five productions already have sponsors in Lehman
Brothers and Unilever. And this is on top of the Pounds 33m raised to
finance the new auditorium, 90 per cent of which comes from business
supporters.
Glyndebourne has been going for 60 years. But many newer arts companies are
equally successful at selling themselves to sponsors. The Docklands
Sinfonietta is only in its fourth year but has attracted nearly Pounds
200,000 this season from sponsors like Morgan Stanley and Amerada Hess, and
the London Docklands Development Corporation. It has two attractive selling
points, on top of its music: it is based in an economically deprived part of
the country and it has strong educational and community programmes. These
have brought it support from Texaco and Tate &amp; Lyle.
Arts organisations have discovered that it is much easier to raise money for
educational, youth and community projects than for their mainstream
activities. Sponsors find their boards are more likely to nod through what
seem like charitable donations. The organisations know that to get funding
from the Arts Council and local authorities these days, they must provide a
comprehensive educational and community programme so that any sponsorship
money devoted to these causes frees resources for other creative activities.
The development manager in arts companies, charged with raising sponsorship
money, has become a key executive. The personality and the co-operation of
the artistic director is still crucial in keeping sponsors happy, but the
development manager now takes on much of the burden, especially the
socialising after events where the corporate guests mingle with musicians,
dancers or actors - a popular element in many sponsorships.
Successful development managers are flexible. The days of the mammoth Pounds
200,000-plus sponsorship for a single event are over. They are prepared to
accept smaller sums in return for a sponsorship, and to put together
packages of sponsors. So, the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden (still the
most supported arts organisation, with an income of Pounds 6.1m from
sponsors, corporate and private Friends, and galas in 1992-93), has
persuaded Cable &amp; Wireless to sponsor its grand new production of the year,
Die Meistersinger (which opened yesterday), for a modest Pounds 100,000. The
rest of the production cost has been found by the Friends of Covent Garden.
The Royal Academy is particularly successful at creating joint sponsorships.
Its present exhibition, of 20th century American art, has Merrill Lynch as
its one main sponsor, but American Airlines helped with transporting
pictures and curators and the Daily Telegraph is the useful media backer to
provide publicity (see picture opposite).
The RA is successful in attracting sponsors because it offers an excellent
environment for entertaining corporate guests, has a smart image, and offers
sponsors the opportunity of a guaranteee against loss  - with the outside
chance that an exhibition might produce a surplus to share out. The National
Gallery and the Tate share the advantages of attractive rooms for corporate
hospitality, plus an unrivalled reputation for the quality of their
exhibitions.
They can afford to be selective and prefer one sole sponsor. This month,
British Land is backing the Tate's Ben Nicholson show and has arranged that
all its 8,000 shareholders have access to special evening viewings. In the
New Year, Ernst &amp; Young sponsors a major Picasso show. The National Gallery
has fewer special exhibitions, but Esso remains its long-term supporter and
is behind the present re-assessment of the Wilton Diptych.
The museum which has taken the hunt for sponsorship furthest is the Victoria
&amp; Albert. In addition to finding Far Eastern corporate sponsors for its
renovated Korean, Japanese and Chinese galleries, it typifies the new
flexibility. Pearson, owner of the FT, is backing two important scholarly
exhibitions in the near future: on the work of Pugin in 1994 and William
Morris in 1996. Samsung, backer of the Korean gallery, and Mobil are funding
scholars for three years to work in the field of Korean art and Victorian
studies. Pilkington is providing help in kind: an impressive glass
balustrade for the new Glasss gallery opening in January.
Loaning the expertise of corporate executives to an arts organisation, on a
daily or long-term contract, is another potentially important form of
sponsorship which is formalised in ABSA's Business in the Arts scheme.
Another new approach is favoured by Jeremy Isaacs, Covent Garden's supremo.
He is looking for sponsors who will subsidise seat prices at particular
performances, so enabling students and the less advantaged to enjoy a trip
to the opera or ballet.
This is an extension of the successful Midland Proms season at the ROH.
Research by insurance company Clerical Medical on the way audiences see arts
sponsorship suggested that many people regard reducing the cost of tickets
as the most acceptable form of business involvement in the arts.
One encouraging feature for development managers is that companies now are
much more prepared to support the avant-garde and regional events. The lure
of the tested and tried in the metropolis is less powerful. Some of the most
successful sponsorship-getters are away from London. The Nottingham
Playhouse boosted its revenue from Pounds 9,000 in 1980 to more than Pounds
120,000 this year, with Youngers recently adding another Pounds 175,000 in a
four-year deal. The West Yorkshire Playhouse has moved ahead from Pounds
68,000 two years ago to a projected Pounds 200,000 this season. An
interesting initiative here was to involve the staff of Marks &amp; Spencer in a
community play, Magnetic North, which the company sponsored.
The top development managers are already being poached. Lucy Stout, who
helped to build the National Theatre's sponsorship success, is on her way to
the Welsh National Opera.
Some arts organisations feel, with justification, that they should not need
to join this hunt, or become hucksters in the market place. They believe
their artistic programmes are strong enough to draw sponsors to them. But
sponsors respond to well-managed arts organisations, and respect
professionals.
Sponsorship, as a source of funding the arts, is not going to be replaced by
enhanced government subsidies. Those few arts companies that still go
through the motions in attracting sponsors will lose out. Perhaps they
should apply quickly for one of the courses at leading business schools
designed to introduce arts personnel to the mysteries of management.
Naturally, these are sponsored - by English Estates.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Special report on Arts Sponsorship: A monster tamed by
Europe's red tape - Simon Tait explains how the arts alone could have lost
millions if an MEP's proposal had been accepted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOTORIOUS Eurocratic red tape may have worked for the good of arts'
sponsorship by placing a noose around a monster which could have been hugely
destructive.
A frisson of panic went through the corps of sponsorship brokers with the
draft report of a French Green Party MEP, Yves Fremion, which suggested
sponsorship was just an inexpensive publicity outlet for rapacious big
business. He cited Voltaire's remark that anybody who gives does so out of
bad conscience, and suggested that those getting sponsorship money were
corrupted by it.
'The all-invasive presence of the brand name does not shock sportsmen much,
but it does shock artists, even those who are resigned to it . . . Choices
of sportsmen and artists are increasingly subject to the will of the
sponsor,' the report said. Fremion suggested to the European parliament that
sponsorship should be banned unless sponsors agreed not to have their names
associated with it.
The damage which would have been done if this report had been accepted at
next month's European parliament plenary session - binding members to it -
is immeasurable, but millions could have been lost to the arts alone.
Guinness, an Irish company with huge interests in Europe (biggest brewer in
Spain, owner of the biggest distillery in Germany) which sponsored the Royal
Ballet's Paris season this summer, would have cancelled all its sponsorship,
worth between Pounds 1m and Pounds 1.5m. And few companies could have
persuaded shareholders that there was any advantage to sticking with
sponsorship under Fremion's conditions.
As it was, British MEP Patricia Rawlings led an assault on the report in
committee and 125 amendments have been demanded before it is considered
again next month. Rawlings describes Fremion as a 'a nice man but quite
wrong and terribly ill-informed on this.'
Yet, he has his sympathisers. There is concern that sponsorship can be used
to spear products into sections of the community insidiously through arts'
sponsorship where advertising cannot - alcohol towards youth, for instance,
through support for avant-garde music, theatre and dance.
Whatever its future, though, the report - by getting the subject discussed -
could well have given impetus to a bandwagon that is rolling in Europe
already. Earlier this year Cerec, the three-year-old European version of
Britain's Association of Business Sponsorship for the Arts, commissioned a
report into pan-European arts' sponsorship.
This report, funded by financial consultant Arthur Andersen, canvassed 200
companies in 10 European countries and revealed that while arts' sponsorship
has been growing at 5 per cent a year for the past three, over the next
three it is expected to grow at 12 per cent annually. European sponsors also
spend more than national ones, averaging Pounds 500,000 in 1992 compared
with Pounds 340,000.
British companies use the arts to get them into European markets, and Rank
Xerox's Pounds 200,000 sponsorship of the National Theatre's coming tour of
Sweeney Todd in Hungary will give it valuable political as well as business
contacts. Perhaps more altruistic, though, is The Economist magazine's
decision to celebrate its 150th birthday by funding a Pounds 240,000 English
language exhibition to travel in eastern and central Europe.
Anne Vanhaeverbeke, Cerec's director, says: 'Arts' sponsorship clearly is a
developing culture in Europe. It is encouraging that the French electricity
industry, which is to be privatised, is looking at sponsorship to raise its
community profile, and this comes at a time when the French government is
not generating anything like the subsidy it did.'
She added that the French also were looking at adapting the British business
sponsorship incentive scheme - the government's programme of encouraging
business support for the arts by matching first-time sponsorships (which is
itself being spread overseas with Pounds 250,000 having been allocated to
the British Council this year). The French also are believed to be looking
closely at the Spanish scheme where certain banks must turn over a
proportion of their profits to arts foundations.
North American companies are using sponsorships to get into Europe and
Northern Telecom, AT&amp;T and American Express have been to the fore. In 1994,
tobacco giant Philip Morris is sponsoring a competition European design and
art students.
The British Council, the UK's official cultural gunboat, has set about
sponsorship with spectacular success. It began in 1988 by raising Pounds
670,000 but the target last year was Pounds 5.8m for all sponsorship; in the
event, Pounds 7.23m was realised, Pounds 5.29m for the arts. Europe took
about Pounds 2m of that but the council is concerned to attract sponsorship
money beyond Europe and into the third world. Brazil and the Pacific rim
have been the most successful.
Almost no impact has been made in Africa so far, but India is coming up
fast. In one notable example, the Standard Chartered bank, which has been in
India since 1858, is to spend Pounds 150,000 - the most it has ever
committed in the sponsorship field - to funding Northern Broadside's
production of The Merry Wives of Windsor in seven Indian cities.
John Pank, the bank's communications chief, says: 'It's a calculated
sponsorship - Shakespeare is hugely popular in India, and this production is
bound to be a success. We have done local sponsorship on an ad hoc basis in
the past, but we will be doing more, and we'll be more driven in the things
that we do. It's a matter of image.'

FT  09 OCT 93 / Special report on Arts Sponsorship: Recession puts damper on
corporate aid - Companies are being courted as never before, but money is
not easy to come by
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH government is threatening to cut back on its financial support
for the arts; hard-pressed local authorities are finding it difficult to
maintain their funding; and box office receipts have been hit by the
recession. In this triple whammy for the administrators of the nation's arts
companies and venues, there seems one possible saviour - the corporate
sponsor.
Sponsors are being courted as never before but, unfortunately, business is
none too prosperous. Companies which are closing factories, reducing staff
levels, freezing dividends and fighting to re-build profits are not in the
strongest position to increase their commitment to arts' sponsorship.
Colin Tweedy, director-general of the Association of Business Sponsors of
the Arts (ABSA), expects that its annual audit, to be released in November,
will reveal a standstill in sponsorship spending for 1993. A year ago,
sponsorship in the UK was estimated at Pounds 64.4m, showing a 14 per cent
rise in the year.
The figures disguised a remarkable switch in funding: direct sponsorship had
leapt by 28 per cent to Pounds 57.5m, while money invested in corporate
membership schemes had fallen by 37 per cent to Pounds 7.8m. Obviously,
companies cut back on entertaining - on the seats at opera houses, theatres
and concert halls that were not always used efficiently - while still
believing that funding arts events was worthwhile, despite a recession.
Few companies wished to endure the embarrassment of withdrawing from
sponsorship commitments; and while certain traditional supporters -
prominent among them the banks, insurance companies and oil multinationals
(with NatWest, Royal Insurance and BP as representative cases) - froze or
reduced their arts budgets, there were enough new sponsors, or committed
backers, to keep up the good work.
Companies sponsor the arts for three, not necessarily compatible, reasons:
as straightforward patronage, with Marks &amp; Spencer an obvious example; for
entertainment opportunities (an area where Digital has succeeded
wonderfully, making contact with most of its earmarked prospective
customers, usually at sponsored dance events); and as part of a public
relations and marketing exercise (most typically, in brands like Becks Bier,
Haagan-Daz and Levi which want to improve their appeal to an affluent youth
market by sponsoring trendy arts events).
The balance between the differing motivations is changing, though.
Old-fashioned patronage is declining as a prime factor: even M&amp;S is not
averse to some public appreciation of its generosity. Entertainment will
always be important (look how easy it was for Glyndebourne to raise Pounds
33m, mainly from business, for its new theatre) but the driving force behind
sponsorship in the past year has been the marketing man. To justify spending
the money to boards, shareholders and workers, arts sponsors have to make
out a case - and sponsorship as a means of improving corporate or brand
image, or actually boosting sales, is the most effective case.
Of course, many sponsorships still are determined by the enthusiasm of the
company chairman for a particular art form, but the power of the marketing
men is growing. Even the UK's biggest sponsor, BT, watches closely the media
coverage of the events it fructifies with its Pounds 1.8m. annual spending.
When the South Bank's national touring exhibitions of art, a Pounds 1m
investment over three years, failed to get the publicity expected, BT paid
for extra PR help. Its sponsorship is community-based and anti-elitist - it
supports amateur theatrical and music societies - but BT needs its credits.
The marketing thrust of arts sponsorship is more visible through the
increasing interest shown in promoting brands, and the evaluation of the
event concerned. In the past, advertising agencies have failed to get to
grips with sponsorship. But it was a leading agency, Bartle, Bogle, Hegarty,
which suggested that its Whitbread brand, Boddingtons beer, should back an
annual Manchester arts and television festival, and that the advertising
should revolve around the sponsorship.
BMW sponsored a Rouault show at the Royal Academy through its BMW-8 series,
with a model of the car displayed in the courtyard; Unilever backed Royal
Shakespeare Company productions at the Barbican through its Persil, Comfort
and Flora brands; and the Faberge exhibition coming soon to the Victoria &amp;
Albert will promote both Faberge and Brut toiletries. Crosse &amp; Blackwell, a
Nestle brand, has just signed a Pounds 2.2m, 30-month deal to sponsor the
weekly Masterclass programme on Classic FM, a national radio channel.
It is true that one attraction of sponsoring through a brand, rather than
under the corporate name, is that the event can be credited to a first-time
sponsor and, thus, qualify for some of the Pounds 4.5m that the government
finds each year for the business sponsorship incentive scheme (which is
designed to encourage new sponsorships). But, even without the BSIS,
branding is a growing force in sponsorship. It is encouraged by the
development of another pre-requisite of modern marketing: evaluation.
One insurance company, Clerical Medical &amp; General, decided that it would
invest more heavily in arts sponsorship. Before it committed a Pounds
100,000-plus budget, it undertook a Pounds 15,000 evaluation study of the
audience for the arts and its reaction to sponsors. The results were
encouraging, and the company will continue to switch money to the arts. It
is also selling the findings, through ABSA, to other cautious sponsors. Hill
&amp; Knowlton, one of the PR companies now eyeing the money in arts'
sponsorship, also has an evaluation package on offer to sponsors.
Clerical Medical also is involved in another of the new trends in its
sponsorship of a Channel 4 television series, The Concerto. This development
is a double-edged sword. If companies decide to sponsor the arts through
broadcast programmes, it could reduce the money available for the living
arts. Classic FM attracted more than Pounds 4m in sponsorship money in its
first year through programmes like the British Gas-backed Classical Gas. In
the past few weeks, Prudential has invested Pounds 100,000 in the station to
advertise its annual Prudential Award for the Arts, an annual Pounds 300,000
package which remains the largest corporate-sponsored prize in the field.
Nestle exemplifies neatly the way the business is going through its Pounds
2.2m Masterclass deal. This also manages to fulfil one of the perennial
attractions to sponsors of arts sponsorship in being educational and aimed
at youth. Many companies still help the arts through their charity budgets
(the size of which is linked to their profitability), syphoning money into
educational activities. Perhaps the biggest sponsorship announced in the
past year was the Pounds 5m Hanson has committed over many years to the
National Youth Theatre.
Some predictions about arts sponsorship have failed to develop. After the
great splurge for the Japan Festival in 1991-92, which attracted Pounds 12m
in direct sponsorship from Japanese companies in the UK, Japanese business
has held fire (largely because of economic problems at home). The whole area
of payroll giving and private patronage, the main way of funding the arts in
the US, also has marked time because the government's tax incentives were
just not large enough.
The past year has placed great strains on the increasingly professional
development managers of the UK's arts companies, whose task is to bring in
ever-higher levels of sponsorship to keep their organisations going. They
are being forced to offer more in terms of publicity and back-up to keep
existing sponsors faithful, and to attract new backers. Often, they have to
accept lower sums in return for a sponsorship or to put together packages of
sponsors, sharing the cost.
Media coverage - or, rather, the lack of it - remains a key restraint on
sponsorship. ABSA reckons that 62 per cent of sponsors now get credits,
which is an improvement but still not a convincing figure. The lack of
support from the BBC when it broadcasts sponsored events is a particular
cause for concern.
Arts' sponsorship remains a self-contained industry. In spending terms, it
might be only a fifth the size of sports' sponsorship, but it is growing
more rapidly because it offers sponsors an affluent, opinion-forming
audience as well as the chance to be hospitable and feel a warm glow. It has
attracted remarkably few parasites: there are still only five established
consultancies - Kallaway, Crowcroft, Spero, Anthony Fawcett, and Arts and
Industry - on hand to offer clients advice and organisational skills. They
have been joined by ABSA, which is adding a commercial consultancy service
to its successful lobbying role.
Sponsorship will struggle to grow in 1994 as long-term commitments come to
an end and are not renewed. (Few think a sponsorship should last forever).
But its blend of altruism and commercial advantage are getting known better
 -and appreciated - and there are still thousands of potential corporate
sponsors in the wings.
Perhaps the most encouraging feature of the industry's development is that
the fears of the more puritanical arts administrators - that sponsors would
interfere with artistic choice, or encourage presentation of the bland and
the commercial - have not come true. In the main, sponsors feel it is a
privilege to be associated with the arts, although harder times are forcing
them to assert their financial muscle. That means the arts can expect more
searching assessments from their sponsors.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Gardening: A garden of unearthly delights - Patricia Morison
visits Scotland's subtropical paradise / the Logan Botanic Gardens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRANGE and monstrous plants flourish at Logan Botanic Gardens, Scotland's
subtropical paradise. Logan belongs to the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh,
but it is lies far to the west in the centre of the poetically named Rinns
of Galloway. A mile to the east are the gentle waters of Luce Bay; to the
west is the Irish Sea. Getting to Logan is an expedition (Stranraer is the
nearest town), but worth it for a garden which is a plantsman's paradise.
Walking under the famous avenue of Chusan palms, sniffing the leaf of a
20-year-old lemon verbena growing in the open, you pinch yourself to think
that this is Scotland. If it seems too far-fetched, think instead of
Ireland. Galloway, too, is warm and wet, a pastoral landscape where the air
is deliciously relaxing and smells of muck. As in Ireland, hedgerows at
shore level are bright with the orange gold of crocosmias. This summer,
there were even escaped white daturas growing wild on Glen Luce Bay.
Logan's soil is sandy and slightly acid; rainfall is high, an average 40ins
and fairly from month to month. Because Logan is warmed by the Gulf Stream,
chief curator Barry Unwin and his team can grow plants out of doors all the
year round. Such tender specimens as myrtles and trachelospermums flourish
at Logan, which provides a home for the rarities brought back by the Royal
Botanic's plant-hunting expeditions to the southern hemisphere.
Lashing salt-laden winds were always Logan's enemy as well as rare but
devastating freak periods of icy weather such as occurred in the winters of
1962 and 1978. As years pass, Logan's protection grows denser with its outer
shelter belts of spruce and pines, and behind them attractive groves of
pittosporums, griselinias, and olearias, New Zealand daisy-bushes.
Two hundred years ago, according to a local historian, cheap foreign labour
gave the garden at Logan its first really stout barrier against the salt
spray. French prisoners taken in the Napoleonic wars were apportioned to the
great houses of Scotland. The McDoualls of Logan, settled in the Rinns since
1300, set their unfortunate Frenchmen to work with a vengeance.
Down at Port Logan, the prisoners excavated a huge saltwater fishpond to
provide the McDoualls with fish for the dinner-table. From the granite spoil
they erected the massive, pink walls of the Walled Garden. Like other 18th
century lairds fortunate enough to live in Scotland's mildest regions, the
McDoualls were already doing nicely from sales of fruit and vegetable.
Thanks to the fortunes of war and higher standards of living, they proceeded
to do better still form their working garden.
The exotic place we see today is the creation of two generations of
McDoualls passionate about adventurous botanising. Agnes McDouall and her
two sons, Kenneth and Doublas. They contributed funds handsomely to the
great botanisers of the last century, Forrest, kingdom Ward, Farrer, and
Ernest Wilson, and took their reward in plants - magnolias, rhododendrons,
the famous tree-ferns and Chusan palms. A good number of the specimens they
planted still survive.
The brothers themselves went on expeditions. They brought back species like
primulas and meconopsis, and invented the peat bed technique for growing
them in acid-free, moist, conditions. When next I go to Logan, it will be in
late spring to see the meconopsis whose blue brilliance is, they claim,
finer at Logan even than at the Botanics in Edinburgh.
The McDouall brothers' failure was to perpetuate their own line. Logan
passed to a cousin, then to Sir R Olaf Hambro who greatly restored the
gardens. On his death in 1969, most of the garden was handed over to the
nation.
So although fairly new as a botanic garden, Logan has its historic pedigree
and no other can beat the romance of its setting. Dominating the Fenchmen's
walls is the ruined medieval tower of Bailzieland where the McDouall lairds
had clung grimly on through a murderous 15th century.
Beneath, in the Walled Garden, high summer under the huge tree-ferns,
Dicksonia antarctica, always sees a magnificently colourful display of
semihardy and tender perennials.
The Edinburgh garden introduced South African diascias to British gardens,
so you find them in abundance, together with turquoise felicias,
argyranthemums, tawny vendidiums, verbenas, and several dozen different
tender sages. This is the part of the garden to gather ideas. For the rest,
the walls, terraces and wooded slopes are the place to marvel at rarities
and pine for plants which, short of emigration, one will never grow.
In late summer, Fascicularia bicolor develops huge rosettes of pillarbox red
with a silver centre and lilac-flowered middle, the plant world's answer to
the baboon's bottom. Monstrously tall variegated phormiums send up 18ft
spikes of flower on stems as black as coal. They are overtopped with ease by
the drying flower heads of the incredible echiums of Madeira.
Strange fuschias disconcert as well as delight. Tiny yellow-flowered blooms
point purple stamens up from a 2in procumbent New Zealander. If ever there
was a nightmare plant it is Fuchsia excorticata which pushes its purple
blooms straight out from the suppurating brown bark of stems thick as a
tree.
No child will forget the Gunnera Bog with its monstrous leaves looming 20ft
tall and 10ft across. No adult will forget the splendour of a
scarlet-flowered metrosideros Umbellata, a New Zealand Christmas tree, in
full bloom.
Logan is Scotland's antipodes, its garden of unearthly delights. There is
something to see all the year round, and probably something you will never
have seen before on these shores. From October 31 to March 14 you must ring
to arrange a visit. Tel: 0776-86231.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Fishing: Farewell to a legend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I HEARD some sad news in Ireland recently. I heard it in a suitable place,
beside the finest and most challenging trout river in the land, the Suir in
County Tipperary.
It was news of a man who had, in a quiet, unintentional way, made himself a
legend of that river. We had driven to Cahair from the Blackwater seeking
respite from a fishless hours after salmon (that evening as the angelus
sounded from the little chapelin Killavullen, I was to hook the only fish of
the trip, and after a minute or two lose it , and taste a despair which is
with me still).
We strode through the meadows downstream from Swiss Cottage, the pleasure
house built by the Charteris family to decorate their estate. Beside the
broad water was a tiny figure, that of a Frenchman, an old friend of my
friend Niall, and a man with a deep, sustaining love for the Suir and its
discriminating trout.
Jean Pierre embraced Niall, and shook my hand warmly. Then he told us that
Liamy Farrell was dead, and the early autumn afternoon at once seemed a
little greyer and more chill.
Liamy was a big man, with short-cropped white hair over a rubicund face.
Many years before any of us had known him, he had been employed (there was
doubt as to whether work was the right word) for the Post Office. He had had
an accident and been invalided out of the service with a disability pension
and a limp which did nothing to inhibit his sprightly progress up and down
the river.
The Post Office's loss was much to the benefit of the Suir and its
fishermen. Liamy gave to the river as he took from it, fiercely defending it
against those he identified as its enemies poachers, polluters, rough types
from Cork and for many years acting as a highly conscientious secretary for
the Cahir Angling Society (from which tickets to fish many miles of water
can be had absurdly cheaply).
Although Liamy occasionally strayed as far away as the Blackwater, the Suir
was his passion. He had a genius for water, to a degree I have only
encountered in one other fisherman; and he, too, was an Irishman.
Through his almost daily communion with the river, Liamy acquired an immense
knowledge of its weed-rich depths, blessedly abundant fly life, and its
teeming trout.
Even more remarkable than his watercraft was the way he chose to fish. I
have never seen anything to match the Liamy Farrell technique. The man had
only one rod, and it was not a thing of beauty: a severely functional glass
fibre spinning rod which looked as if it could have subdued a smallish
shark.
With it, Liamy spun for salmon and trout, and wormed for salmon and trout.
And with it he also contrived as quiet and elegant and efficient a
presentation of a dry fly as I have ever witnessed.
The trout of the Suir demand a finesse which is beyond such as me. Their
larder is well-stocked, and rarely do they do more than pick at the juicy
olives above their heads. Persuading such a well-fed canny creature to take
an artificial seems more like magic than skill.
It was beyond me again that afternoon, as on so many before. You must
present the right fly in the right size delicately, without drag, again and
again, as often as not in a fierce downstream wind ; and keep at them, until
a fish rises at last, and you miss him, or he breaks you.
It is testing stuff, and brings home to you in a way unimaginable with the
bloated, slow-witted stockies of the English chalkstreams wherein lies the
true art of the dry fly.
Day in, day out, Liamy limped tirelessly up and down that river, duping
those epicureans with the wispy little flies which he ran up in the shed at
the back of his council house. And as his fame spread, so did he gather a
band of disciples, youngsters who fished Liamy's way, employing their ten
foot spinning rods with the delicacy of a wand. It was as if a great golfer
had opened a coaching school, at which pupils were encouraged to use croquet
mallets rather than clubs.
And the disciples caught fish, although not so many nor as big as Liamy did.
He was a quiet, slightly secretive man, parsimonious with information about
the scenes of his triumphs; ever modest and self-deprecating in his soft,
murmuring Tipperary accent.
At the end of April, Liamy caught a wild brown trout of 6 3/4 lb on one of
the bends below Swiss Cottage. Within a month he was dead.
The mass of trees along the river were coming into leaf then, and when we
were there they were just turning, showing autumn's gold. Beneath, the Suir
ran as clear and bountiful as Liamy Farrell would have wished to remember it
with those damnably difficult trout still rising merrily away.

THE HARVEST mouse is Britain's smallest rodent, a tiny scrap of a thing
weighing little more than a 20p coin. It is only about the same size as a
pygmy shrew and, like the shrew, it has a high metabolic rate in order to
maintain its body temperature.
The ratio between its body mass and its surface area is 4.8, very high when
compared with, say, a 30gm wood mouse which has a ratio almost half that at
2.5. Because it loses heat so rapidly, the harvest mouse eats a large amount
of food, up to 30 per cent of its own body weight daily - almost as much as
the wood mouse.
Traditionally harvest mice are pictured feeding on the ripe ears of wheat
but, while their diet does consist of seeds and fruit at certain times, they
also feed extensively on insects, occasionally on birds' eggs and even on
each other.
The harvest mouse habitat is generally thought of as corn fields and these
supposedly scarce mice were reputed to have suffered a further decline when
combine harvesters were introduced. In fact, they are distributed widely
throughout England with local strongholds in Scotland and Wales.
In some locations they are considered common although numbers can fluctuate
markedly from year to year. Furthermore in spite of combines, they appear to
breed successfully in corn.
A safer alternative, however, and one used by many harvest mice, is to live
over water. These gingery white-bellied mice have tails with a prehensile
tip and, equipped with this safety line, they clamber about happily in grass
and reeds, their slight bodies hardly flexing the stems, and so they rarely
need to come down to the ground during the summer.
They construct their round nests from the living leaves, shredding each into
thin strips and then weaving a ball from these. Thus for some time the nest
stays the same colour as the plants from which it is built and cannot slip
down the stems.
In the autumn though, when the population is high, the dying reeds become
untenable. As water levels rise they disperse to their underground winter
quarters. At this time, harvest mice fall prey to barn owls and other birds.
The mice breed rapidly, especially in captivity, and their small size and
frequent periods of activity make them most attractive. The progeny of an
original pair of harvest mice may be passed on to interested friends to
establish colonies.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Gardening: A bird in the box is worth . . .
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GHOSTLY white bird floating across the road in the dark just glimpsed in
the headlights is the only view many people have of a barn owl.
Sadly for many owls it is their last sight of anything as, with their eyes
blinded by headlights, they crash and perish. But road verges are one of the
few hunting grounds left to them, especially in arable areas where hedgerows
have disappeared. There, in rough grass, barn owls can find the voles and
mice they need to survive.
For over half a century, barn owls have been in decline in Britain as their
food habitats and their nesting sites in old buildings have disappeared. For
almost the last 20 of those years it has become increasingly popular to
breed these owls in captivity and to release their progeny into the wild.
Owls have been farmed out to individuals who felt they were doing something
positive for the survival of the species. After all, these rather ugly,
large-beaked, fluffy young, with their far more beautiful, speckled-plumaged
mothers, were living proof of the conservation effort they were making.
But it is now known that this is far from the case. According to the Hawk
and Owl Trust, some 3,000 young barn owls are released each year - when the
total wild population is only 4,500. If all that was needed were more owls,
then you would have expected a population explosion. But this has not
happened, for young birds, bred in captivity and inexpertly released, are
pathetic at adapting to the wild.
The British Trust for Ornithology suggests that only 10 per cent survive and
it doubts that captive-bred barn owls have boosted the wild population at
all. The real problems - food and lodging - were being missed.
The lack of nest sites is simple to deal with - erect an owl box. The big
difficulty is the lack of rough grassland. It is the need to increase this
habitat, and hence the number of mice and voles which live there, which has
been such a problem.
The recent changes in agricultural policy, leading to the establishment of
schemes such as set-aside, together with the extension of Environmentally
Sensitive Areas, could see the restoration of many acres of rodent rich
grassland.
The need for funds to monitor this work, in order to better advise and plan
for the future, is the basis of a new appeal from the Royal Society for the
Protection of Birds.
With more food available, captive-bred barn owls may survive better after
release. On the other hand, with its basic needs attended to, the existing
wild population may grow unaided and captive breeding can cease.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Property: Rise in sales lifts hopes of recovery - State of
the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SLOW RECOVERY continues in the housing market. The Corporate Estate Agents'
Property Index, collecting data from 4,300 offices, reports that while
August saw the expected holiday downturn, completed sales were 47.5 per cent
above those of August 1992.
Admittedly, that was an unusually inactive month, as former chancellor
Norman Lamont's holiday from stamp duty had just ended. But it is still a
large increase and suggests that confidence is returning steadily.
House prices, whether measured by Nationwide or Halifax at the lower end of
the market or Savills at the top end, are still below levels of a year ago
despite small increases in recent months. For Nationwide, the average house
cost in September of Pounds 53,149 was 2.5 per cent down on September 1992
and 2.5 per cent up on January 1993. These sums show how modest the
improvement is.
The Savills' figures, computed up to June, average Pounds 321,606 for a
house in the country (down 2.9 per cent on 1992) and Pounds 516,510 for a
town property (down 2.3 per cent).
Large price increases in London tend to be the exception, says Paul Raymond
of Chestertons Residential; he notes that prime properties in Kensington
have risen as much as 10 per cent since the year's beginning. Sales to
foreigners are largely responsible.
For the British, lower mortgage rates and higher disposable incomes for most
people in work have made houses at their most affordable in 20 years,
according to Savills, while Nationwide estimates the house price to earnings
ratio at 2.95 and Halifax at 3.4.
Any further cut in interest rates would make houses more affordable still,
probably without causing major price increases. But, having been burnt in
the aftermath of the 1980s' boom, buyers are wary of over-borrowing again.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Property: Black Wednesday's positive side - Cadogan's Place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPERTY Vision's review of the market, issued to celebrate the firm's first
10 years, sees an almost-biblical cycle of seven years' growth followed by
three of recession. The 1980s' property boom brought wonderful business for
the developers of new homes; the gentrification of outer-central London
(Battersea, say, or Islington); and an extraordinary demand for country
houses (met partly by barn conversions) and farmland. Money from selling
houses in London, often to foreigners, fuelled the rush to the country,
where prices spiralled to unrealistic levels.
The collapse in 1989 was fast as talk turned from 'gazumping' to 'negative
equity.' Sellers could not believe the fall and held out for prices which
buyers would not (and still will not) pay. Agencies crumbled through lack of
business. But the Black Wednesday devaluation of sterling brought manna from
heaven. Foreigners came to London and bought, once again releasing people
eager to buy in the country - if only there were houses for sale.
The trend is upward, Property Vision says, but not sharply so. Selling a
four-bedroom house off Kensington High Street in west London buys an old
vicarage in Wiltshire, with money to spare for re-decoration. The graphs for
such prime properties have run in tandem, except that houses in the country
rose faster and peaked earlier late in the 1980s than those in London.
The situation is back to when Property Vision was founded in 1983 as a way
to find good houses and negotiate reasonable prices for buyers at a time
when all the advantages lay with vendors and estate agents. Now, buying and
re-location agents are as established as estate agents. The firm's latest
success has been to buy the Easton Grey estate in Gloucestershire for around
Pounds 4m, quietly, before it came to market. The vendor's agents were
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley.
                         *       *       *
RENTING flourishes in today's market, thanks to the security for the
landlord of assured shorthold tenancies and the hesitation, first, of
purchasers to buy and, now, of vendors to sell. Cluttons London Residential
estimates that a 10 per cent yield is feasible on good London properties but
adds, wisely, that it is better to forego the last Pounds 20-30 rent a week
than lose a good tenant.
In Hampshire, John D. Wood (0962-842 4742) is offering Tichborne Park near
Alresford. This property has a lake and moat fed by the River Itchen, plus a
butler/chef and gardener, at a guide price of Pounds 5,000 a month.
                         *       *       *
THE AUTUMN CROP of houses for sale suggests that, at last, potential sellers
are acting, perhaps unable to delay their own moves for another year. If it
is an interesting property, they can be sure of many buyers' interest. In
Scotland, Knight Frank &amp; Rutley in Edinburgh (031-225 7105) is selling the
lightkeeper's houses at St Abbs Head, Berwickshire, for the Commissioners of
Northern Lighthouses: a cottage, two flats, outbuildings, walled garden and
no end of bird life. Offers over Pounds 90,000 for a twitcher's delight.
Near Stranraer, in south-west Scotland, the price of Lochnaw Castle - for
more than 600 years, the seat of the Agnew family - has been cut from Pounds
475,000 to Pounds 250,000, for a quick sale. The agent is Savills (031-226
6961) and the vendor is the Lochnaw Castle and Estate Trust, set up by an
Australian branch of the family to restore the castle. But funds are short
and the vendor hopes the buyer will complete the job. The castle comes with
a loch producing 400 trout a year, 200 acres of woodland, and a walled
garden built for therapy by soldiers recovering from the wars with Napoleon.
                         *       *       *
ONE FOR sailors: Dolphin House, a fine nautical property between Cowes and
Ryde on the Isle of Wight, is on offer for over Pounds 380,000 from Humberts
(071-629 0909) or Christopher Scott in Newport, Isle of Wight (0983-721778).
It has its own inlet from the creek with mooring, slipway, pontoon, boat
store and workshop. * * * ONE FOR the green-fingered: a substantial house at
Sissinghurst, Kent, where Vita Sackville-West made her great garden at the
castle (now owned by the National Trust). Knight Frank &amp; Rutley in Tunbridge
Wells (0892-515 035) offers the Court on the edge of the village, a
half-timbered and brick house dating to the 17th century.
Included are a cottage that was once a chapel, a barn (which the vendors,
Judith and Martin Miller, who publish the Antiques Price Guide, have made
into offices) and five acres. For Pounds 495,000, here is the chance to
create a garden to rival that of the neighbours.
                         *       *       *
THE NORTH-WEST offers more house for your money. Jackson-Stops (071-589
4536) is selling Netherby Hall in Cumbria (and almost in Scotland). Listed
Grade II, and mentioned in the writings of Sir Walter Scott, it began as a
medieval tower house - for many centuries, the best way to survive on the
Scottish borders - and is now a confection of 17th, 18th and 19th century
styles.
It has a Scottish baronial entrance tower, fine Georgian doorways and
plastered ceilings, and 17th century panelling that is probably Flemish. For
Pounds 850,000, you get the house, two cottages and 32 acres.
                         *       *       *
THE BIRTHPLACE in West Sussex of the poet Shelley is available for Pounds
2.5m from Jackson-Stops. Field Place near Horsham (and Gatwick airport) is
listed Grade I. The house is a handsome, late-17th century brick facade on
typical half-timbered Sussex construction with a wing built in stone.
Shelley was born there in 1792.
Its immaculate recent restoration revealed a great hall and won a Europa
Nostra award last year, while its 217 acres include a lake. Among the
outbuildings are a 15th century barn, Tudor stables, and two '17th or 18th
century hovels.'

FT  09 OCT 93 / Travel: The bear necessities of Aspen life - Skiing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNOLD WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOW THAT winter is almost here and the first snows have dusted America's
magnificent Elk range of mountains with a fresh white mantle, Aspen's
townsfolk are breathing a sigh of relief. The bears are about to begin their
big sleep. Guests can now sleep easy in their beds, too.
Last April 1, telephone calls about a bear on the lower half of Ajax
Mountain in Colorado during ski-racing were at first dismissed as an April
fool's joke, until someone actually saw the bear padding up Spar Gulch, one
of the resort's most popular ski trails. It had been hibernating in an old
mine-shaft and - perhaps roused by the sound of the race tannoy - had woken
up early.
It was to be the first of many bear-sightings in the Rockies' most famous
resort, many riffling through dumpsters and exploring garages. In Crested
Butte, just across the Elks, a jogger was joined by a bear for his morning
run. It chased him down the mountain track. Fortunately he was able to
out-run it until he reached the sanctuary of the town.
Then, in May, the unthinkable happened: in the middle of the night a bear
swaggered into the grounds of Aspen's newest and most prestigious hotel, the
Ritz Carlton, and took a dip in the swimming pool. If the news leaked out,
the hotel reasoned, there would have been panic which could have sent its
pampered guests running for cover. Not good publicity.
The bear's bloodied footprints were spotted at daybreak by a security man.
The security camera was played back; sure enough, there was the shadowy
figure of a substantial brown bear lowering itself into the water. It was
timed at 3.40am.
The bear swam around for 12 minutes and then - in its struggle to get out -
damaged a foot with the claws of the other. Hence the trail of footprints.
The pool was drained, cleaned and refilled, and the story was hushed up -
until weeks later, when the news leaked out. Far from driving customers
away, the story raised the hotel's profile.
Is it bears or people who are the problem? 'Some people try to attract bears
so they can watch them,' says the Colorado Division of Wildlife (DOW).
'That's like free ice-cream to the bear. It starts poking around the house
and the people call us and want the bear removed.'
According to the authorities, people - including holidaymakers - need to
realise they are living in the bears' backyard. 'People move here to
appreciate nature and enjoy the wildlife, yet they worry every time a bear
walks through their backyard,' says Mike McLain, the wildlife supervisor in
Telluride, another famous Colorado ski town. 'They have to take some
responsibility for their choice of living here. Yet every time a bear turns
up, they ring us and ask us to remove it.'
With the bears safely out of harm's way, Colorado can get on with the new
ski season. Breckenridge, the favourite resort for British skiers, has been
sold by its Japanese masters and gobbled up by Ralston Purina, which
manufactures dog food among other things.
It also owns the rival resort of Keystone and Arapahoe Basin. Ralston now
owns every resort in Summit County's 'Ski The Summit' alliance except Copper
Mountain. Will it go for the grand-slam? Aspen, too, has been buying up the
opposition: after years of being a small but irritating thorn in Aspen's
side, the maverick resort of Aspen Highlands has finally fallen into its
famous neighbour's clutches. Stand by for ski wars: Aspen's four mountains
vs Summit County's 10.
Also stand by for another heroic British performance in Aspen's 24-hour
endurance race for charity, in which racers in teams of two spend all day
and all night launching themselves down Aspen's steep cruising trails at
speeds approaching 90 miles an hour, completing serial descents in around
two minutes 30 seconds. Does anyone know - or care - that two British
skiers, Malcolm Erskine and Mike Jardine, astonished everyone in town last
winter by coming fourth?
The racers can only take 12-minute rests each time they return to the top of
Ajax in the Silver Queen gondola, and towards the end of the marathon some
of them start hallucinating: pink elephants and catfish were mentioned.
The idea of Brits coming to Aspen, skiing the mountain 80 times in 24 hours
and seeing off a lot of European and North American skiers is almost too
good to be true. This year the self-effacing Erskine, once in the British
ski team, is coming back with a new partner, Mark Blyth, a former British
junior champion, for another attempt.
Perhaps if more young British skiers took advantage of free skiing in
neighbouring Crested Butte every year - the only resort in the world I know
of that offers free skiing before Christmas - we would have promising young
racers in greater numbers. This winter Crested Butte is going one better.
The resort is offering beginners taking its 'Quick Start' courses their
money back if they are unable to ski from the top of the Keystone lift to
the bottom.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Travel: Darker side of a dream trip - William Pitt found the
back roads of Bali more terrifying than tranquil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BALI IS a word that conjures up dreams. So says an old holiday brochure we
have lying around the house. Having returned from Bali, I can vouch for its
accuracy. Unfortunately, not all my dreams are pleasant.
To be sure, some are populated by tranquil Balinese, placing rice offerings
for the gods at every door. Men and women are clad alike in bright sarongs
and wear flowers in their hair. But there was nothing tranquil about the
women from the village of Penelokan who rushed to surround our vehicle and
thrust gaudy batik textiles up against the windows. Something close to
desperation shone in their eyes.
My worst dream features three young men, their leader stripped to the waist
and carrying a long stick, on a lonely road in the crater of a volcano.
It happened long after dark as we were leaving Toyah Bunkah, a spa village
on the shores of Lake Batur, in north-east Bali. On the map the village had
appeared the ideal place from which to climb Gunung Batur, the second most
revered volcano on the island after mighty Gunung Agung to the south. But
the visit had not been a success: Toyah Bunkah (which means holy water) had
proved as mean as its setting was magnificent.
The batik sellers in Penelokan, up the hill from Toyah Bunkah, had given us
a foretaste of the region. We had come from Ubud, a village whose
wood-carving emporia and bungalow inns seemed to have crowded out the
houses. But at least the people were relaxed. By contrast, the women of
Penelokan made the gypsies who flock to wash car windscreens on the
outskirts of Spanish cities seem shy and retiring. I later read that some
garage attendants in Penelokan pull pieces off visitors' cars and then offer
to repair them.
The fervour of Penelokan's batik sellers surprised but did not worry us. We
were not planning to stay there, despite the splendour of the village's
setting on the rim of the huge crater.
Our goal was Toyah Bunkah, down a steep and narrow road across an ancient
lava flow. At the entrance to the village a uniformed guard demanded 500
rupiah (about 15p) per head 'for the hot springs.' We never saw the springs:
litter blew down the streets and along the shore of the lake, sapping our
enthusiasm for an outdoor bath.
Over the next three hours our disenchantment with Toyah Bunkah grew. The
people were alternately surly and aggressive. The pie dogs were just
aggressive. Loud rock music blasted from the Under the Volcano Homestay. The
food in the only frequented warong (restaurant) was appalling. We returned
hungry to our hotel - our guidebook called it the best on offer - to find
huge cockroaches clambering over our luggage.
We had planned to climb Gunung Batur at dawn. But having shaken the roaches
from our possessions we decided to cut our losses and leave town. It was
about 10pm. I went in search of the hotel staff, a task made difficult by a
sudden power-cut. There was no one to be found.
On the road out of Toyah Bunkah, just before it begins to wind, a red
mini-van overtook our vehicle. Three men jumped out, their leader
brandishing his stick. It seemed unlikely that they wanted to sell us batik.
They may have come from the hotel, where we had left a note on the bed
saying: 'Too many cockroaches.' Or maybe they were robbers. Either way, I
decided not to argue with them.
They had omitted to block the narrow road with their mini-van. I drove up to
the man with the stick, made as if to lower the window, slammed on the
accelerator and drove on up the hill. A crash on the roof registered his
annoyance.
They pursued us closely for perhaps 10 minutes, during which time our
vehicle never got beyond second gear. The bends were very sharp, but the
Toyota took them like a seasoned skier tackling a mogul run. My main fear
was that a stray dog or pot-bellied pig might wander out in front of us.
At the top of the hill our vehicle's speed began to tell against the
mini-van's. We high-tailed it back to Ubud where, amid the bungalow inns and
sleeping gift shops, we felt secure.
Later we learned that the region around Gunung Batur has a poor reputation.
For some reason the people did not seem to have come to terms with tourism
as comfortably as most Balinese. Or maybe the region had always been
lawless. Anthropologists attribute much of the cohesion of Balinese society
to the cultivation of rice in terraced paddies, which requires close
co-operation among villagers. But around Lake Batur there are no rice
paddies.
Such explanations are rarely more than guesses. I do not know what made the
people of Toyah Bunkah different from the people of Ubud. But I left Bali
thinking that perhaps, for once, the beaten track offered the best views.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Travel: Under Prague's historic skin - Christian Tyler gets
to the heart of the Czech Republic's multi-faceted capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRAGUE from the air looks less like a capital city than a smiling country
town to which a thoughtless 1950s planner has added overspill housing
estates.
In approaching this city, one of the great spectacles of Europe, one can
choose instant gratification by ignoring the suburbs and plunging directly
into the antique beauty of the Old Town. Or one can give Prague her due and
savour the greater pleasure of unpeeling her, slowly, like an onion, from
the outside.
We had arranged to rent rooms in the suburban flat of a former Czech
diplomat in expectation of a privileged introduction to the place. But his
wife fell ill, the substitute apartment we were offered was too far from
Metro and tram stops, and we ended up in a self-contained flat in the
eastern district of Zizkov - conveniently close to the city's best tram
route, the Number 9.
The area was poor, the building was a grey 1930s block and music blared from
behind the first door on the dank stairwell. But the flat itself, though
plain by our standards, was big, clean and newly-decorated with bathroom
tiles of a trendy toad's-belly design. I wondered if the landlord, a Mr
Hranicka, ever lived there.
It was unfamiliar but homely. We could watch the neighbours dressing and
cooking in the flats opposite. A blackbird sang from the roof by day and the
local drunks serenaded the street by night.
Although the view from the windows was limited, from Zizkov we commanded,
thanks to the Number 9 tram, a fine historical perspective of Prague. The
tram picked us up in the grim neglect of post-war Communism, trundled past
monuments of the city's industrial heyday in the 1930s, descended past the
late-empire merchants' offices and deposited us near the gothic Powder Tower
at the entrance to the old city.
Prague's preservation owes a lot to the shame of Munich when Chamberlain and
Daladier allowed Hitler to begin his eastwards expansion. What Hitler lost
is today being peacefully reclaimed by German tourists and investors. The
Czech Republic feels already part of western Europe (and one trembles for
the future of its incomparable beer). I saw only one ugly reminder of the
past, the words wir kommen wieder] scrawled on a wall. There are other
reminders outside the city, such as Terezin, the former Theresienstadt
concentration camp for Jews.
The old city is crammed with tourists - it must surely soon overtake
Amsterdam as Europe's hippy mecca - but has a carnival gaiety about it. The
arena bounded by the theatrical facades of Old Town Square has become a
vendors' market and circus. Some of the attractions are ingenious: boys were
forging souvenir swords on a portable furnace; an animal trainer had
terriers with ruffles round their necks jumping through hoops; a ferret
stared out of an old mortar casing carried by an unshaven type in battle
dress - presumably he was a central European exponent of the well-known
Yorkshire virility test.
If the old town can be claustrophobic, at peak periods the famous Charles
Bridge is suffocating. The western youths who come to live and busk in
Prague strum drearily on their guitars (sample from one monotonous
troubadour: 'Just because you're going forwards doesn't mean I'm going
backwards . . . ').
They are outclassed by the native musicians: brass quartets, baroque
ensembles, Dixieland bands, dulcimer-players, flugelhornists. Even the
little old man scraping a violin while his wife kept time with a
stick-shaped tambourine was putting his back into it.
Indeed, though architecture is Prague's glory, music is its connecting
theme. The sound of string-players tuning up drew us to the Chapel of
Mirrors where we were able to watch a rehearsal before running round the
corner to take in a choral concert in the dusty gloom of the Tyn Cathedral.
Even the muzak in the restaurant where we dined that night (the excellent U
Plebana in Betlemske square) was classical muzak.
Architecture and music come potently together in the Tyl theatre, built in
1780, where Mozart conducted the premiere of Don Giovanni. It is a handsome,
sideways-on building, recently restored and now a playhouse.
Understanding no Czech, we paid our homage to Mozart by booking in, somewhat
doubtfully, for a surrealist version of The Marriage of Figaro in a scruffy
hall near the top of Karlova Street. We were not disappointed. As with the
buskers and the souvenir-sellers, we were forced to marvel at the
inventiveness of the Czechs. The opera, given in full, zipped along with an
orchestra of 12 players; the singers were of conservatoire standard and the
shoe-string production was farcical, ingenious and witty.
It is as if the Czechs are still celebrating their release from the old
regime (independent Slovakia has less to crow about) and westerners are
welcome to the party. If you have not yet seen Prague, you should - and
soon, too, before the hustlers and the crowds take all the fun out of it.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Travel: Taking tea in the Sahara - Rupert Wright takes to
the sands on an exhausting 1,000km journey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RUPERT WRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOROCCO has generally been the domain of the French traveller. As Lord
Salisbury commented in the House of Commons in 1890: 'We have given the
Gallic cockerel an enormous amount of sand. Let him scratch it as he
pleases.'
The French are still there in force - on mountain bikes, in Renault 4's,
even on foot, though their rule ended in 1956. They still treat it as a
colonial playground, rather like the South Africans treat Botswana.
Eight of us set off in two Land Rovers, with local drivers and a guide. Our
luggage and camping equipment was loaded on to roofracks. The plan was to
drive from Marrakesh to the Sahara, camping on the way, then back over the
Atlas mountains.
It is important in a party of this size (most of whom had never met) that
everybody gets on well: two bottles of Scotch between us and a bottle of red
wine each on the first night ensured that if there had been any flickerings
of animosity, we were unable to remember them.
First stop was the Glaoui casbah of Telouet, a castle set in a green valley
among brown hills. The Glaouis used to rule southern Morocco, and owed much
of their fortune to the patronage of the French. With the return of King
Hassan II, their lands were forfeited and their fortunes seized.
The casbah has been derelict for less than 30 years, but already the walls
are badly cracked and the chimneys falling down. Inside there are still
three rooms full of intricate tiles, kept locked by a guide wielding a
1ft-long key, who dreads the final eclipse of the casbah as it will rob him
of his livelihood. In the meantime, it makes an impressive ruin. We had a
fine lunch in the gardens and watched a family of storks soaring above us.
When you camp for the night, you realise how little of the country you see
motoring through villages at speed. One evening we stopped at what looked,
from the road, an innocuous spot near a river. As the tents were pitched we
were free to explore for an hour before dinner. We discovered an oasis of
small walled fields - wheat, maize, peas and broad beans, with palm trees
along the hedgerows. The inhabitants were friendly enough, but shy. The
women weeding would wave, then run away if we approached.
From the comfort of a four-wheel drive vehicle the Sahara, at least at its
edges, is not that daunting. The countryside is often quite rocky: one day's
drive was like going round a gravel pit. In the afternoons we would gather
in a large tent and play bridge while the guide and drivers cooked chicken
soup or lamb kebabs. As it grew darker, camel spiders would enter the tent.
We stamped on them.
In a room in a house in a small village marooned 100km from anywhere we sat
on rugs while a village elder brewed mint tea on a gas stove. The air was
thick with flies. Five times he poured it out of the tea pot into glasses,
then back into the tea pot. Then he added more sugar. It tasted like very
sweet washing-up liquid.
When the wind blows in the desert, visibility falls alarmingly, even during
the day. It is then that you are glad to be in a vehicle, and not on foot or
camel. One evening we were due to camp among the largest sand dunes in the
world at Merzouga. There was nothing to see of the sand dunes, although we
could taste and feel them. We cruised past a man on a bicycle, blown by the
wind but seeming to make no progress.
A French-style inn called the Auberge du Casbah served us long cool glasses
of orange juice. In Erfoud we stayed in a hotel for the first time in three
days, and were able to wash.
After the desert it was a relief to head for the clean cool air of the High
Atlas mountains. At the foot of the Todra Gorge, where the view is most
exciting, are two small basic hotels. Next morning for the first time most
of us had food-poisoning.
Two hours' drive away is the Dardes Gorge, which boasts an outcrop of
phallic rocks. We picnicked under a walnut tree. Gradually a number of small
children crept up on us, although they hid every time we pointed a camera at
them. The final drive was over the Atlas to Ouarzazate, with the drivers
happy to be going home and the guide entertaining us with tales of illicit
liaisons with western travellers.
We had covered over 1,000km in a week. For some of the party this had been
too much motoring. But the sight of the stars in the Sahara and the view
from the top of a 300m-high sand dune, with Algeria away to the south and a
single track leading north to the horizon, were reasons enough to visit the
desert.
Among specialist tour companies, Worldwide Journeys &amp; Expeditions of 8,
Comeragh Road, London W14 9HP (tel: 071-381 8638) organises Land Rover
safaris in Morocco. For a 10-day round trip from London to the Sahara and
High Atlas, prices start from about Pounds 850 per person.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Travel: Preaching to the converted in Ireland - Nicholas
Woodsworth samples Guinness, rain and the life of small communities on
Europe's edge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS something haunting and mystical about the west of Ireland. That, at
least, is what they say, and I was willing to believe them. I had spent too
much time in the big city. My nerves were jangled. I needed tranquility. I
needed Irish whimsy and soft Celtic twilight.
Hibernian at-one-ness is not achieved just like that. It has to be worked
at, so as I drove westward from Dublin I filled my little rented car with
the music of Irish harp and pipe. Hardly had I left the Liffey than my soul
began to stir. As I whizzed past green cow pasture and midge-infested bog it
lightened and took to the air. By the time I scented the salt air of Galway
Bay I was feeling transcendent.
Fifteen minutes later, at the end of a two-mile tailback into Galway town,
it all came crashing down. There is one week in the year when tranquility
flees the west of Ireland. It is the week of the Galway races.
Half of Dublin empties and comes out for 'the crack' - that whiskey-, music-
and blarney-driven gregariousness which makes up the larger part of the
Irish genius. But it does have its drawbacks. In Galway there is not a bed
to be had, a parking space to be found, a bar stool to be sat on.
Had the crowds that filled the town been white-haired Irish biddies and
soft-spoken country gentlemen in tweeds, it might have been different. But
there were back-pack armies on the streets of Galway wearing combat boots,
Mohican haircuts and rings in their noses. And those were just the women. It
was all too much. Off I drove, in search of a gentler kind of crack.
The Aran Islands - now there was a place, I thought, where one could leave
it all behind. As I dawdled north and west along the coast of Galway Bay,
hardy little men in hand-stitched pullovers paddled doughnut-shaped fishing
boats through my imagination. But half-an-hour later I was on my way again:
the ferry landing where the Aran boats depart was a jam of tour buses,
bright nylon camping gear and gesticulating Frenchmen in new, Aran
pullovers. At peak holiday season the islands so renowned for isolation and
a quiet way of life were choking on their own reputation.
I motored northwards into the stark hills and treeless bogs of Connemara.
This, at last, seemed more like it - suddenly, I felt peacefully alone in a
great space on the farthest edge of Europe.
Mauve fuchsia blooms hung heavy on roadside hedges. Miniature haystacks sat
marooned in a jigsaw puzzle of rock-walled fields. Piles of turf lay stacked
on the bog beside deep cuts filled with tea-coloured water. Down by the
shore austere, white-washed cottages sat brooding under a fine drizzle.
The west of Ireland is the only place I know that looks good in the rain.
There is an integrity about the countryside, a harmony of gentle colours of
earth and sea - greens and greys, duns and heathers, shaley blues and peaty
browns - that is profoundly peaceful.
By Letterfrack I stopped in a thin Irish mist to watch two local teams
savage each other in the game of Gaelic football. It is such an odd, exotic
sport I found it hard to belive I was still in Europe. A few miles on I
stopped again to ask directions from a group of girls. The reply was in
Gaelic, and they had to point the way to Roundstone.
Was the lovely little coastal village of Roundstone, with its grey sea wall
and bobbing fishing boats, its single sloping street and brightly painted
houses, to be the end of my road? Alas, no. So well known as a lovely
coastal village has it become that there was not a B &amp; B room vacant. As I
arrived, a BBC film crew was preparing to video-tape an evening of quaint
Irish set-dancing in a quaint Irish pub. I fled.
The situation was grave. The west of Ireland seemed over-run by Dubliners
seeking the crack and foreigners seeking the twee. Every second town between
Kerry and Donegal had a traditional music festival, a lobster festival, a
country fair, a beauty contest, a medieval pageant, a smoked-salmon
celebration or a re-enactment of the foundering of the Armada. Such
festivals are the only things that keep the depressed towns of the west
afloat these days.
But they were not what I wanted. Where, I began asking around, feeling a
complete fool, was there absolutely nothing going on?
On Clare Island in County Mayo, I was told, nothing has happened for years.
Immediately I made tracks up the coast and abandoned my car at Roonah Quay,
the little port that sits opposite Clare Island at the mouth of Clew Bay.
The reports were right. The most exciting thing that happens around this
part of mainland Mayo is the procession of bare-footed penitents up Croagh
Patrick, Ireland's holy mountain. On Clare Island itself things are even
quieter.
Four hundred years ago Clare was the domain of Grace O'Malley, a pirate
queen who terrorised the Irish coast. These days the excitement is not quite
as great, but the income is more regular. Like most of the 150 souls on the
island, the O'Malleys - still the largest clan here - have discovered that
EC subsidy payments to sheep-farmers are a surer bet than piracy.
This does not mean that the island has lost any of its local flavour;
Brussels has a long way to go before it standardises life on Clare. When I
stepped off the ferry at Clare's tiny port (one pub, one stone castle, three
houses, one telephone box) I saw an old black London taxi ticking over at
the end of the quay.
How civilised, I thought, and prepared to climb aboard. But no, on Clare
only lobsters travel by taxi. The vehicle belongs to a local fisherman who
prizes it for its capacious interior; inside were piled half-a-dozen large
lobster traps. My own transport, a muddy great tractor driven by my charming
young B &amp; B proprietress, Maureen O'Grady, arrived a few minutes later.
What does one do on a small, isolated island that sits exposed to the full
force of the Atlantic? Often one does nothing. I spent my first day drinking
tea beside a coal fire and looking out at the gale that swept in from the
open sea.
The wind moaned, the rain surged down the window-pane. It was the kind of
weather that not even sheep enjoy. Further, along the shore-line, waves
smashed into the high rocks, sending white spume flying.
But isolation has its benefits: it makes people sociable. Later the wind
dropped, the rain let up, and I walked the half-hour back to the pub by the
port. It seemed that every villager on the island was crowded into its smoky
bar. There was the usual chit-chat and gossip of small communities. I talked
with Seamus, Maureen's burly red-haired brother, about raising salmon on the
off-shore fish farm where he works.
But sometime after 11pm, when most pubs have closed their doors, the band
struck up and everyone under the age of 80 settled down to a proper session.
Clare islanders like a bit of music, even Father Peter Gannon, whose
impromptu late-night pub appearances have resulted in local fame and a
cassette you can buy at the bar.
I did not stay hooting and dancing and emptying glasses of Guinness until
5am as Maureen and Seamus did, but I stayed long enough to talk to Michael
Moran, retired island postman. With 30 years of professional island cycling
behind him, he is sceptical of today's technology. 'I met a German on a
cycle tour the other day,' he shouted at me over the pub din. 'He told me
his bike had 21 gears. I couldn't see the need. Mine went fine, and it had
just two legs.'
I should not have been surprised at his reply when I asked how best to get
to know the island; I took his advice and the next day began walking around
on my own two legs. I walked to the beach by the port and paddled about in
glacial waters. I hiked over to the Bay View, the island's only hotel, ate
fresh salmon and gazed across the water at Croagh Patrick.
On Sunday morning, like all the islanders, I made my way past the island
abbey and a cemetery full of long-gone O'Malleys, O'Gradys and Morans, and
went to mass. Father Gannon had abandoned the accordion for the cassock, and
delivered a sermon on the need for spiritual contemplation.
As far as I was concerned he was preaching to the converted. My spirit had
never felt more contemplative. My nerves were slowly unjangling, my senses
no longer so jaded. I did not want to leave. I wondered if I could trade it
in for 100 sheep, marry Maureen O'Grady and settle down by the sea.
Perhaps there was an opening for a postman. Or a lighthouse keeper. I could,
with a bit of learning, play spoons for the musical priest. What they say is
true. There is something soul-stirring about the west of Ireland.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Food &amp; Drink: The sleepy side of life for Weekend FT readers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the Weekend FT of September 18 Nicholas Lander wrote about the problems
which restaurateurs face when a diner falls asleep. This seems to have
tickled readers' fancies and, judging by your letters, is a far from
uncommon problem. We offered a bottle of pink champagne to the reader with
the best solution to a dozing dining partner. The winning letter comes from
Takuro Hoshi of Japan who provided one of the most detailed accounts of how
to deal with the problem. Letters have been cut and edited where necessary.
From Christina Foyle
I was amused by your article on people who doze off at luncheons. I have had
two experiences of this.
Jeffrey Bernard (journalist and raconteur) fell asleep on my shoulder at a
luncheon I gave to Judge Pickles. On another occasion, many years ago, the
chairman at the lunch was Sir Walter Gilbey (of gin fame). The chairman
should confine his remarks to introducing the speaker, about five to ten
minutes, but Sir Walter Gilbey spoke for an hour and a half] Nobody could do
anything to stop him.
In front of my father, an elderly gentleman had fallen asleep and it looked
rather rude so my father picked up the toastmaster's gavel and tapped the
man on the shoulder. The man stirred and said: 'Hit me harder, I can still
hear him]'
In arranging my luncheons the worst two things that can happen are that the
speaker talks too long, or is drunk, especially if it is a bishop]
I am sure my next one for Lady Thatcher will not suffer from any of these
problems.
Maldon, Essex.
From Helen Smelt-Webb
Your article on dozing diners was very amusing. I have one solution. Take a
feather from your boa and light it from the candle on the table. The smell
will rouse the soundest sleeper.
Stillington, York.
From Mr CH Massingham
Thank you for your interesting and amusing article in today's Weekend FT.
Here is my remedy: Always have a pillow available (and all serving staff
aware of it), suitably embroidered with the words: 'One needs to be awake to
enjoy our food but you are always welcome.'
Should a similar instance ever recur, with the minimum fuss, remove
dangerous items such as glasses etc. from the table and replace with pillow,
with wording facing the other guests.
When the couple finally leave, do not remove the pillow. You and your other
guests out of natural curiosity will try and pass the table to try and read
what was written on it.
Thus, afterwards, when the victim or any other of the guests tell their
friends about the incident, they will not be talking negatively about the
sleeper, but positively about the restaurant.
Lee-On-Solent, Hants.
From Peter Hollins
We recently held a sales conference at a country club in Tennessee. One
evening a salesman fell asleep over dinner, much to the amusement of his
25-30 colleagues.
Everyone quietly left the dining room, the lights were dimmed and a waitress
then awoke the sleeping guest and presented him with the entire bill for
dinner]
His horror at the enormity of his faux pas was only matched by his
embarrassment when he realised that the whole act had been watched by his
colleagues, as well as members and staff at the Country Club.
Boston, Massachussetts.
From Gabriel Goodall
Your article touched a particularly raw nerve in that for a number of years
I have been falling asleep in precisely the same circumstances as you
outline.
On one occasion I had finally persuaded a particularly attractive girl to
come to dinner. I woke to find an appropriate note and no girl. Whilst one
can laugh about it I can assure you that this affliction, somehow peculiar
to restaurants, renders one almost powerless to stay awake.
I have in the past sought medical advice - to no avail. When afflicted I
have gone to the restaurant bathroom and splashed cold water on my face;
drunk large quantities of water quickly; gone outside for a walk in the
fresh air etc.
The most frustrating aspect is that if left asleep until after dinner one
has subsequently an extraordinary surge of energy and a strong inclination
to continue the night's activities 'clubbing' and so on. One's friends of
course just want to go home to bed.
London SW11 From ALR Fincham
One of the more exclusive cricket clubs I have occasionally had the
privilege of turning out for is the St Moritz Cricket Club, which stages an
annual match on the frozen lake there each February.
Some four to five years ago, one of our number fell into a deep sleep over
the team dinner in a local restaurant. We sent for a spare tablecloth and
covered him from head to toe with the cloth so that he took on the
appearance of a ghost.
Every now and again throughout the meal the ghost stirred, thereby causing
amusement to other diners, but he never woke until we left the restaurant at
the end of the evening when we, not without difficulty, recalled him from
his deep slumbers and took him home.
I think the restaurant staff probably found this approach helpful as, if I
recall correctly, they did not serve the individual concerned with any food,
no doubt because they are not in the habit of serving meals to ghosts.
London SW4
From David Chandler
Many years ago I was in a south London Chinese restaurant late at night. One
of a party of four at the next table had fallen asleep, spread awkwardly
cross the dishes. His snoring had caused glances and sniggers until a lady
at another table leaned forward. 'Wouldn't he be more comfortable in the
chow mein?' she asked. The place exploded.
Bromley, Kent.
From Nick Mathys
I read with amusement your article. On a sailing trip in Scotland some 20
years ago a similar event occurred. After a hard sail in a pre-war racing
yacht the night had been spent in harbour and breakfast was to be taken in a
waterside hotel. One of the crew fell asleep at breakfast, not merely
subsiding to the table, but immersing his face in the porridge.
No action was taken. No doubt an excess of fresh air the day before was the
cause. However, after the rest of the crew had eaten the first course, the
good young lady serving breakfast arrived with bacon, eggs and all the other
goodies which make up a true Scottish Breakfast. She was uncertain as to the
correct action.
The skipper did not hesitate. Seizing his crew member by the hair he lifted
his head, removed the porridge and, placing the next course beneath his
face, lowered him back again.
No complaints were received either then or later.
In the possibly more sophisticated surroundings of a London restaurant, may
I suggest removing the diner's plate, applying if necessary a hot wet towel,
and providing a clean plate - with perhaps a napkin as well  - for him to
continue to sleep on?
Chelmsford, Essex.
Dr Robert A. Kisch
My grandmother is said to have always carried a bottle of smelling salts: in
those days, ladies had this valuable item handy for themselves against
faintness both in their young and not-so-young days.
When grandfather Albert dozed off in a restaurant (inevitably towards the
end of the main course of meat), she was wont to administer a sniff which
effectively woke him up for the rest of the meal.
Waiting staff could carry such an item and offer it discreetly to the
embarrassed (awake) partner to adminster, perhaps?
Today, I find that the offensive level of background 'music' tapes stops me
enjoying such a snooze . . . but that is another story.
St Ouen, Jersey
From David Edwards
I am surprised that you regard the sleepy diner as a rare and novel
phenomenon. He is commonplace in times of stress.
Ashore after a stint of North Atlantic convoy duty or even after competing
in the London Head of the River race a fit young man can be overcome by
irresistible drowsiness when exposed to warmth and a little alcohol. He is
far from being drunk but he just can't stay awake.
A jet-lagged businessman is often in the same condition. A solution that
works well in these cases is for the maitre d' to offer, on a salver, a
luggage label and Biro to the apparent leader of the party.
The maitre d' should say: 'If you would be so good, sir, to write the
gentleman's name and address on this label we will get a taxi and see him to
it if you so desire.'
It is of some importance that, if the offer is taken up, the label be
securely tied to the casualty's buttonhole so that there is not an identity
problem at destination.
With a mixed couple the situation is more tricky. A somnolent male is
probably responsible for the account and his partner may be both unwilling
to settle on his behalf or to escort him home.
The label trick is worth trying nevertheless as the lady, no matter what her
relationship, is put under no obligation by being helpful. If you want your
money it may be worth your while to send a member of staff with him to his
destination.
With men you can afford to wait on events. Nothing dramatic is likely to
happen if your offers are refused; but should the sleeper be female I
suggest you call a taxi and then firmly see the couple to it using all
powers of persuasion that are at your disposal. The lady on waking will nine
times out of ten create a scene you will very much regret.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Sleeping diner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From TAKURO HOSHI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As a businessman, I have encountered several times the embarrassing
situation of a sleeping diner. I myself pinch my thigh under the table to
deal with this peculiar syndrome (rather common among Japanese businessman
especially when abroad).
For the sake of fairness, I must point out I have noticed on a few
occasions, Europeans drowsing in restaurants in Tokyo.
The Solution is 'OSHIBORI' (literal meaning is 'a squeezed').
Perhaps you know what it is as you have surely visited a Japanese
restaurant. But just for good order's sake, it is a wet hand towel served
when we are seated at the table, just to clean hands. I don't know any
restaurants in Europe which never served this Oshibori.
Quality of towel: Thick, soft and and right size.
Moisture content: Not too wet, nor too dry.
Cleanliness: To say nothing of, but must be always almost new, so usually
white towel if
needed to demonstrate cleanliness.
Presentation: Like serviette folding, how 'squeezed', and usually on the
right small tray - (bamboo, knitted basket. etc)
Scent:Trace of fragrance everyone can accept.
Temperature: In hot summer, straight from fridge, and in winter, steaming
hot.
So now what I want to suggest, is that waiting staff smartly approach with
(cold) Oshibori to ask the sleepy diner if he cares to use Oshibori.

<DATELINE>
   REPORTS of the 1993 northern hemisphere vintage
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
either underway, imminent or long overdue - range from cautious to downright
suicidal. My colleague Edmund Penning-Rowsell will shortly be reporting in
detail on Bordeaux's soggy harvest.
The Portuguese, who seemed poised for success in the table wine market, have
also been experiencing cold rains off the Atlantic. For once it does not
seem premature to assert that 1993 will not be a vintage port year (although
both 1991 and 1992 were splendid).
Those who harvested early, and bothered to spray carefully earlier in the
season, may make some good wine in the south of France, but 1993 tried the
patience of organic viticulturists almost everywhere.
Northern Italy was washed out in many parts, although late last week Piero
Antinori was still optimistic about the prospects for Central Italy (where
1992 was disappointing). The Champenois are putting on a brave face, but
there has not been a single vintage that could be described as generally
good throughout Europe since 1990.
The 1993 vintage was better in the southern hemisphere, and some exciting
whites are beginning to arrive from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and
Chile. This is as good a time as any for the most die-hard classicist to
explore the best that these countries have to offer.
An excellent place to start is the Australian Wine Centre, 50 Strand, London
WC2 (071-925-0751). Its new list boasts many an exciting find in the Pounds
4 to Pounds 8 range, among the predictable taunts about cricket and the
monarchy.
It was the centre's Craig Smith, for example, who first imported the
extraordinary Heritage Cabernet Franc 1991, an arm-twister with about as
much in common with a red Loire as Paul Keating. This extraordinarily dense,
voluptuous red is now listed by Bottoms Up and Wine Rack at Pounds 7.49.
Smith will not get his allocation until January but, meanwhile, can offer a
Cabernet Malbec 1991 at Pounds 6.49, from the same style of concentrated
low-yield, unirrigated, hand-picked fruit grown in one of the less
blistering parts of South Australia.
This is the one place in Britain to find the sort of Australian bottlings
that elicit drools from the normally phlegmatic ('make mine a beer') wine
writers of Sydney and Melbourne. The centre has a particularly glamorous
range of Australia's dry Rieslings from Pounds 3.49 to Pounds 6.99 a bottle,
and will deliver any order worth Pounds 75 free anywhere in the UK mainland.
A South African selling at Pounds 8.58 a bottle somehow managed to wrest the
Chardonnay Trophy from many a grand white burgundy at this year's vast
International Wine Challenge organised by WINE magazine. Dieu Donne 1992 is
due in to the warehouses of Tanners of Shrewsbury (0743-232400) this week.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Fungi business at Claridge's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE RAIN falling constantly for the past fortnight has caused considerable
damage in the UK, washed out fields of salad crops and vegetables and
confined fishing boats to harbour - thereby pushing up the price of fish.
But there is a silver lining, particularly if you like early morning walking
in wet woodlands with a bag and a small, sharp knife. This is the time of
the year for ceps.
These magnificent mushrooms are, because of a damp spring followed by a warm
summer and then a wet autumn, better and more plentiful than for years.
Ten days ago I was stopped by a friend who was clutching a bag en route to
Antonio Carluccio's shop in Covent Garden, central London. Inside were 4lb
to 5lb of delicious ceps that had been collected on Hampstead Heath, in
north London. He wanted to verify that they were all fit for human
consumption. (If in doubt always check with a book or a local chef).
When Marjan Lesnik, executive chef at Claridge's, walked into his kitchens
on Monday morning there were 30lb (about 14 kilos) of ceps waiting for his
inspection. They had been picked over the weekend by various members of the
hotel's kitchen and waiting staff, mainly Italians, who had earned some
useful pocket money through their weekend foraging.
The wholesale prices of ceps ranges from Pounds 4 to Pounds 8 per lb for the
very best according to Michael Hyams, fruit and veg supplier to London's top
restaurants. This season's weather is producing edible wild mushrooms that
even he has not seen before. On Tuesday he had been shown 60lbs of a
mushroom called Deceiver, fresh from the New Forest and in top condition.
And they are easy to cook. Having cleaned, washed and patted them dry cut
them into thick slices, marinate for 30 minutes in olive oil and grill. As
an accompaniment to almost any main course, slice them more thinly and saute
in olive oil with garlic and parsley.
Or you can try and emulate the professionals. In his new book Keep it Simple
(Octopus, Pounds 18.99, 192 pages) Alastair Little gives the recipe for a
wild mushroom tart he is currently serving at his Frith Street restaurant in
central London. At La Tante Claire Pierre Koffmann has created a new, and
currently unnamed, first course which comprises, on one side of the plate,
thin slices of seasoned raw cep, sprinkled with olive oil, while the other
is taken up with thinly sliced, raw scallops marinated in olive oil, topped
with a few drops of balsamic vinegar. Also worthwhile is the newly published
Mushrooms on the Menu by John Midgeley (Aurum Press, Pounds 8.95, 120
pages).
The cep season should last another three weeks unless early frosts or eager
pickers strike first.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Food &amp; Drink: A static auction year - A recession-hit time
in the saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE RESULTS in the London wine auctioneers' year
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
from September last year to this July - reflected the continuing recession
and varied little from the previous 12 months.
Without the buyers' premium (10 per cent) Christie's turnover in its King
Street sales totalled Pounds 4.49m (Pounds 4.35m); and Sotheby's sold Pounds
2.10m (Pounds 2.07). In addition Christie's took another Pounds 1.02m
(1.09m) in other UK sales and Pounds 3.29m (2.82m) in overseas auctions.
These have principally been in the US, where, surprisingly, after more than
20 years, they have now given up auctioning wine. Sotheby's does not sell
wine outside London and does not issue detailed figures, but it has
increased sales.
A problem for both houses has been lack of stock for, unless pressed for
cash, many owners of fine bottles are not eager to sell when prices are low.
Also a growing number of brokers are selling for their clients wines that
otherwise would have been sent to the saleroom.
The wine most sold there is claret, because the finer growths are the most
collected, often with some expectation of later profit. However, as the
accompanying tables for the first-growths and other prominent
classed-growths show, at least in recent years recession and inflation have
greatly reduced prospects of the latter.
The peak year for ex-cellar en primeur prices was the highly praised 1989.
In spring 1990 the first growths generally opened at FFr230 a bottle and
leading seconds at FFr115 to FFr125. These meant a duty-paid, delivered cost
to retail buyers of about Pounds 590 a case, or Pounds 49 a bottle, for the
firsts and Pounds 320 a case, or Pounds 25.50 a bottle, for the others. Yet,
three years later, Lay &amp; Wheeler of Colchester, Essex, is listing Latour '89
at Pounds 54 a bottle and Ducru-Beaucaillou at Pounds 27.25.
Faced with the beginning of the recession opening prices of the 1990 clarets
were around 10 per cent lower. But in the auction room 1990 has marked the
summit for earlier vintages.
The accompanying tables show the highest average prices for six first-growth
and eight prominent other classed-growths in 1990; in the depth of recession
last year and in the current year to the end of July. (Petrus has been
omitted as its saleroom prices are on such a high level as to distort the
annual averages, but its trend is similar to the rest). In terms of value
and drinkability, the '83s and '85s are undervalued in the saleroom.
The other 'investment' wine, bought when first available after the year has
been declared by the shippers, is vintage port.
Cheap in the saleroom for years, the table shows that it too has declined
since 1990. The '63s and '77s are real bargains for vintage port drinkers,
but there are now fewer of them outside the institutions.
Since early this year Christie's sales have displayed an upward trend: not
so much in individual prices, but in the percentage of value terms of the
lots sold: from 81.55 per cent in January to July last year to 91.45 per
cent this year. Sterling devaluation has encouraged foreign buyers,
particularly from the Far East, and if the economy improves so should
turnover increase in both salerooms in the coming season.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Sport: A sudden end to a coarse career - Rugby Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REVELATION that it was all over came just before the lights went out. It
was a Sunday afternoon in November, and beneath the ramparts of Windsor
Castle a game of rugby, of sorts, was being played. It was a one-sided
affair, and we were on the wrong side. A pernickety referee had decided that
two passing youths, whom we wished to recruit to bring us up to numerical
strength, were too young. We were under the hammer. For myself, I was just
trying to keep out of trouble.
I knew the flesh was weak: bad back, enfeebled ankles, twanging hamstrings,
chronic wind shortage. But the spirit had, hitherto, been willing. Now I
found the spirit had gone the way of the flesh. So I jogged along, leaning
in a scrum here, bending to inspect a maul there, stretching supplicating
hands above my head in the lineouts, stopping whenever possible - usually to
watch a hungry opposition sweeping again through defences attenuated to the
point of extinction.
Suddenly I found the ball in my hands, in broken play. Ancient, treacherous
instincts asserted themselves, and instead of throwing it away, I advanced.
The way was guarded by a vast, muscular creature. As I approached him, the
instinct told me: 'Take the tackle and lay the ball back.' I might have
known that this was futile, and that with none of my team at hand, I would
merely by laying it back to the enemy. Take the tackle I did, and of the
fate of the ball I know nothing. The creature plucked me up by the thighs,
turning me upside down and throwing me up, then left gravity to do its work.
I retired from rugby as I came down. I saw mud and grass rush towards me and
darkness supervened.
That was almost two years ago and I have remained retired. The back is
worse, the ankles and hamstrings more delicate than ever, the wind almost
gone. Feeling as I do now, the idea of playing rugby is ludicrous. Yet there
is a voice - a damnably insistent one - which at this time of year nags at
me, reminding me how I miss it. Looking back over the best part of 20 years
as a coarse rugby man (I did not take it up until manhood), it is not the
achievements on the field which stand out. There were tries and triumphs,
all the more precious for their rarity. And I can still dimly taste the joy
of the surge through a gap, the dive for the line, the leaping catch at the
lineout, the smash of a tackle.
But much more vivid - the real motor of nostalgia - is the memory of
companionship, simply the getting together with other like-minded fellows
for an innocent letting-off of steam on a Sunday in winter. I can smell the
smells of changing rooms, liniment and Vaseline; hear the drumming of studs
on tiles and the snap of elasticated bandages on to meaty thighs; feel the
churn of nerves in the pit of the stomach and the wind and rain in the face
as we ran out out on to the pitch, peering at our opponents to assess if
they looked in any better shape than us.
We never went in for the conventional ritualistic heartyism of the rugby
club. We did not bawl out bar-room ditties, because we never knew the words;
nor did we match ourselves in ale-quaffing contests, knowing we would lose.
Our changing room never echoed to the unison roar of the pre-match chant,
promising annihilation to our opponents. Our tactical approach was
childlike. Indeed, we had no tactics worthy of the name, since - as often as
not - matters of who was playing where were not settled until after the
match had started. We had lineout calls, but they were imperfectly
understood by those who were supposed to jump.
Almost no one knew the rules, which never inhibited us from abusing referees
who did. We never trained, so we had no planned moves. We simply pushed in
the scrums, jumped at the lineouts, got offside at rucks and mauls, tackled
when we could reach someone to tackle, kicked when we had to and ran the
ball when we could.
Afterwards, over our beer, we would either bemoan our naivete or laugh at
the way we had transcended it. We would abuse each other, our opponents and
the hapless ref, and dwell on our blunders and our hopes for next week. And
we would go home warm and happy and wake up aching the next day.
Of course, memory erases most of the boring and bloody side of it: the
joyless massacres suffered, the ugliness of injury and occasional violence,
the physical awfulness of tender feet, flaming abrasions, stabbing stitches.
But it was fun, and life is less fun without it, and I still sense a mute
reproach from my boots and tin of dubbin, as they stand gathering dust in
the cupboard under the stairs.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Motoring: The seat of success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS MANY motorists know only too well, some cars can be a pain in the neck -
and back. According to the findings of a survey by the Osteopathic
Information Service, to be released on Monday at the start of National Back
Pain Week, 80 per cent have back pain and one in four suffers at worst
permanent damage, or at best discomfort, because of driving.
More than half are over 30 years old. Men and women suffer equally. The
taller they are the more likely they are to get back pain, especially on
long journeys. Almost all of those questioned said they were uncomfortable
or in pain within three hours of starting a journey.
As someone who is tall and a long way past 30, I find all this believable.
But why does it happen?
The French used to fit their cars with soft seats to cushion the body from
the shock of driving over bad roads. The Germans took an opposite view,
having seats that seemed stuffed with reinforced concrete. I sided with the
French.
Some of the most fatigue-free long journeys I have made in cars - from the
UK to the south of Spain or to Austria, for example - were in cars with
seats into which one sank deeply. And, in contrast, some of the least
comfortable were made in cars with seats so hard they barely yielded at all
under one's body weight.
In recent years there has been a levelling up. In general, French car seats
have become harder, German ones a little softer. Italian makers still
believe that seats should be a bit squashy. So do the Americans. The
Japanese, who once aped German habits so slavishly they adopted hard seats
and funereal black interiors for any car with sporting pretensions, have
more bottom-friendly upholstery nowadays.
British cars demonstrate Britons' traditional ability to compromise. Their
upholstery is unlikely to offend either lovers of soft seats or those who
would have agreed with the German makers who never tired of telling me that
hard seats (like cold baths) were good for you.
The Swedes - over the years Volvo and Saab have researched seat comfort very
thoroughly - belong to the not-too-hard, not-too-soft school. But there is
far more to seat comfort than the hardness or softness of upholstery.
As cars have become more compact and more aerodynamic, there has been less
space to spare for the driver. Mounting the engine sideways and moving the
driver forward can lead to both pedals and steering wheel being off-set to
the seat.
This is why I never make up my mind about the driving comfort of a mainland
European car until I have tried the right-hand steering version over a fair
distance. The results can be enlightening - and disappointing.
In my experience, Japanese cars nearly always have good driving positions.
Years ago their makers got the message that Europeans were much bigger than
their home market customers. And of course, Japan has the same
keep-to-the-left rule of the road as the UK so their cars have right-hand
drive.
The Osteopathic Information Service says back pain is as likely to trouble
drivers who sit close to the wheel as those who adopt an arm's length
stance.
It is a personal view, but I find some sporty Italian cars less comfortable
to drive than those from north European or Japanese makers. My theory is
that they are still designed for the traditionally short-legged, long-armed
Italian male, not long-legged people like me. And I settle comfortably
behind the wheel of any Volvo or Saab, with lots of space round the pedals,
because they seem to have been built for big people with larger feet than
mine.
The growing popularity of high-roofed, multi-purpose vehicles like the
Renault Espace, and of lofty on-off road 4x4s, may help back pain sufferers.
Their ample headroom allows a driver to sit upright rather than slouch
behind the wheel. People troubled so badly by their backs that they choose
to sit at home in dining chairs rather than deeply upholstered easy chairs
will know what I mean. In a few days time the Osteopathic Information
Service will be going into detail about which cars it considers can reduce
the risk of causing their owners back pain.
In the meantime, it advises potential car buyers:
Try the the praying test. Adjust the seat so your hands just touch the
wheel. Arms straight, with your back and shoulders square in the seat, put
the palms of your hands together. If your fingertips do not point at the
middle of the steering wheel, your spine is slightly twisted.
Now the fist test. Sit normally, so you can depress the clutch fully without
stretching. Put a closed fist on your head, knuckles up and palm down. There
should be at least 6cm (over 2in) between your knuckles and the roof.
Next, sit straight, hands evenly on the steering wheel, left foot on the
clutch, right foot on the accelerator. You should not be able to see more of
one leg than the other.
Drive the car for a short time, then look at the position of your right leg.
Is it at the same level as the left leg (as it should be) or has it fallen
toward the edge of the seat? Is your thigh in line with your foot - or has
it slipped toward the centre of the car?
If a car passes these simple tests, the Osteopathic Information Service says
it should help reduce the risk of your suffering back pain. It may still be
difficult to find a perfect fit, but at least the tests will put you on the
right lines.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Sport: The turnip faces the end of the world - Peter Berlin
previews a week of big games / Soccer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TURNIP goes back in the pressure cooker next week. Graham Taylor, the
England manager and the Fleet Street tabloids' favourite vegetable, is this
weekend coaching his squad in the nuances of the long-ball game in
preparation for his date with destiny in Rotterdam on Wednesday.
Victory would, more or less, ensure a place in the World Cup finals in the
United States next year; defeat could mean the end of the world. A nation's
fans will be glued to their television sets as Taylor stews in Feyenoord's
stadium, the Tub.
Taylor and the England fans will not be alone. Only eight of the 24 places
in the finals are decided. The 500-game qualification process started 19
months ago in Santo Domingo where Puerto Rico beat the Dominican Republic
2-1.
Around 450 games have been played since - give or take a few annulled or
twice-played matches in Africa - but 33 teams are still competing for the
remaining 16 places. Algeria and Nigeria met in Algiers last night in
African Group A to decide whether Nigeria or Ivory Coast goes to the US. All
but three of the othersplay in the next 10 days.
Taylor has one advantage over his rival on Wednesday. Win or lose, Dick
Advocaat, the Dutch coach, will not take his team to the US. If the
Netherlands qualifies, Johann Cruyff will return from Barcelona to manage it
in the finals.
If England makes it, Taylor is safe in his job for five years. The 1996
European championships will be held in England, so his team is excused
qualifying.
Failure to reach the final stages has, traditionally, cost England managers
their jobs although failures in the finals have been forgiven. A win in
Rotterdam, though, and Taylor could watch his side lose every big game until
the end of the qualifying tournament for the 1998 World Cup before having to
find a new job.
A draw would leave matters balanced finely. England has a worse goal
difference than the Dutch. Both play their last matches on November 17,
England away to hapless San Marino and the Dutch in Poland. England would be
giving the Dutch a four-goal start, a handicap which favours England
slightly.
Taylor does not fancy a night of such calculations: 'When you start to think
that way, it will drive you crazy.' He said England would go for a win on
Wednesday.
This is a bluff. Taylor knows the Dutch must attack, and a counter-punching
strategy would suit him. He has not added a creative player to his squad to
replace Paul Gascoigne, who is suspended, and will select a defensive
midfield. England's main attacking strategy will be Taylor's preferred
long-ball game: a vague boot from defence towards the strikers.
Taylor must envy Egil Olsen, Norway's manager. His team leads England's
group and needs to win just one of its last two games to be sure of going to
the US. Switzerland, Belgium, the Republic of Ireland, France and Sweden
also need just one win in two to qualify. All are placed perfectly for an
attack of the jitters.
England and the Netherlands are not the only traditional soccer powers
struggling to qualify. Below Switzerland, Italy and Portugal scrabble for a
place. Behind the Irish, Denmark, the European champion, could qualify if
results go well on Wednesday but, otherwise, faces a showdown in Seville
against Spain. The US organisers will be praying France does not slip and
that Spain, Italy, England and the Netherlands right themselves.
But if the European groups have made the marketing people nervous, the start
of the South American qualifying tournament in July must have terrified
them. Brazil had been in wonderfully creative form in the Copa America and
the US '93 tournament earlier in the summer, but won neither. Then, it
opened its qualifying group with a draw in Ecuador and a loss in Bolivia.
But Brazil, cannily, had scheduled all its home games for the end; it won
the lot and went through.
The three other Latin American teams assured of a final place - Mexico,
Bolivia and Colombia - all are crowd-pleasers. Argentina, the pantomime
villain of world soccer, must win a two-leg play-off against Australia,
starting in Sydney on October 31.
In July, Argentina again showed its big-match resilience, grinding through
matches in the Copa America as it did on its way to the final of the 1990
World Cup. It beat Brazil and then Colombia on penalties; but, in the final,
Gabriel Batistuta scored two superb goals in a 2-1 win over Mexico to
suggest Argentina has added a scoring edge it lacked in Italy. It should be
too tough for the Australians.
Emotions will run high in Casablanca tomorrow where Morocco must beat Zambia
to qualify. Morocco, which lost out on hosting the 1998 World Cup, is the
only north African nation with a chance of reaching the finals and pride is
at stake. The Zambian team, meanwhile, has been patched up from youngsters
and returning European stars to replace the squad wiped out in an air crash
in April.
If they qualify, the indomitable Lions of Cameroon know they will be the
first African nation seeded in the finals. Cameroon needs only to avoid
defeat at home to Zimbabwe tomorrow, but the team has started wrangling over
cash. On the other hand, Zimbabwe must overcome a passionate home crowd in
Yaounde and the ground's reputation for strong witchcraft.
The organisers of Asia's final qualifying group, starting in in Qatar on
Friday, have implored the press to concentrate on soccer, not politics. The
six contenders include North and South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran.
The chief question is whether the J-League has made the sixth team, Japan, a
soccer power.
Franz Beckenbauer, the former German manager, said the champion will be
handicapped because it is excused the qualifying tournament which toughens
teams. The problem, as Taylor could point out, is that it can also eliminate
them.

FT  09 OCT 93 / How to Spend it: Lucky dip of crafts

IF YOU are in the commissioning mood and fancy entering into a creative
adventure with a craftsman of your choice you should visit Chelsea Crafts
Fair, which starts next Tuesday.
Regular readers may remember that is something of an annual celebration, a
happy way of dipping into the best, most creative work in a whole range of
crafts. The fair has become so sought-after that these days it is divided
into two different weeks with a different set of exhibits and exhibitors
taking over in the second week. Those who want to see them all, therefore,
need to make sure they go twice]
Many of those who make the annual pilgrimage to Chelsea Old Town Hall in the
King's Road use it as a splendid opportunity to buy their Christmas presents
early; others see it as a chance to identify the craftspeople whose work
they most like and commission something special, whether it be a
hand-knitted sweater, a fantastical mirror, a refined piece of furniture,
some quirky jewellery or an individually carved toy.
There will, overall, be some 810 different makers with exhibits on sale and
a quarter of these will be people whose wares have not been seen at the fair
before.
There is an admission charge of Pounds 6 which entitles the visitor to one
visit on each of the weeks, or a single visit costs Pounds 4. The first week
runs from October 12-17, the second from October 19-24. It is closed on
Monday October 18. Hours of opening are 10-8 pm from Tuesday to Friday and
from 10-6 pm on Saturday and Sunday.

The nicest jewellery is hand-made and unique to you

BRITAIN seems to have been so busy in the last few years looking backwards,
indulging in a collective nostalgia for things past, that many of our most
talented contemporary designers must sometimes despair. Where, they must
wonder, are the Medicis, the Rockefellers, the Esterhazys of our day? People
who love and nurture the work of artists, who commit themselves to a raw new
talent, encourage it, support it and give it the environment in which to
flourish?
There are some new sources of patronage, of course - the great city
corporations, companies such as De Beers which has done an enormous amount
to encourage a range of fine modern jewellers, silversmiths, enamellers, the
livery companies and a few rich and enlightened private clients - but on the
whole life is tough for the artists and craftsmen of our day.
Those who love jewellery, who have an anniversary, a special birthday or
celebration on the way, might like to look at the work of some of our modern
jewellers. Instead of haunting auction rooms or antique shops, take a wander
round some of the galleries in the UK which do their best to support new
artists.
In London you would do well to make time to see an exhibition at the Lesley
Craze Gallery, 34, Clerkenwell Green, London EC1R ODU. In this unfashionable
part of London Lesley Craze, once an actress, has for years been supporting
the work of young jewellers.
For her latest exhibition - Today's Jewels, from Paper to Platinum - she has
the work of 57 jewellers on sale and on show. It is not intended to be a
comprehensive exhibition of everything that is happening in Britain, more a
personal selection of the work she herself likes and rates. The range,
vitality and sheer beauty of the pieces is staggering.
The jewellers range from well-established names such as Gerda Flockinger and
Wendy Ramsshaw to designers still, commercially speaking, wet behind the
ears. The materials range from the inexpensive and little regarded, such as
papier mache, aluminium, painted tin and acrylics, to gold, silver and
precious stones.
There is a lovely catalogue, with a single plate in full colour illustrating
the work of each jeweller, which would be a marvellous handbook for anybody
wanting a handy visual reference to a wide range of the best work being done
today.
Already there is huge interest in the exhibition. One large public funded
body is looking at the work in order to plan its buying for public
collections, and the London Arts Board has given a grant to subsidise the
catalogue. Those who cannot get to the exhibition, which is on until
November 5, can at least buy the catalogue for Pounds 10 on the spot or
Pounds 12.50 by mail.
Some of the work is remarkably well-priced - for instance, a beautifully
worked brooch, labelled Hearts and Minds, made by Trevor Forrester in
lead-free pewter with lacquered brass symbols is only Pounds 47. A
spectacularly colourful cuff bracelet, made from large ceramic stones, glass
and plastic beads linked with silver wire by Diana Laurie is Pounds 121.
Barbara Tipple has been designing fine modern jewellery for more than 20
years and has been the happy recipient of many awards, including two of De
Beers International Awards. There is nothing cheap or trendy about Barbara's
jewellery - it is made of the finest, most precious materials and is
intended to last forever.
She designs all the pieces herself but for some of the techniques she gets
experts to embellish the pieces - Fred Rich, for instances, one of our
finest enamellers, does her enamelwork and Robert Campbell-Legg her steel
engraving and inlay work.
She works with metals, both precious and semi-precious, bronze and all
manner of stones from the most precious of all, such as Sandawana emeralds
and the finest diamonds, to semi-precious tourmaline and even rock crystal.
She loves combining metals such as steel with 22 carat gold and then adding
the finest engraving or inlaid work. Most of her pieces are strong and bold
and one or two are almost monumental, with an almost primitive feeling which
is counterpointed by the extremely high quality of the finishes and
workmanship.
Most of her work is done to commission. She lives above her own gallery at
100 Marmion Road, Southsea, Hampshire PO5 2BB (tel: 0705-753025) where a
less expensive range of her work, from Pounds 20 upwards with an average of
about Pounds 150, can be seen.
At the moment some of her more precious pieces, such as the ones
photographed here, can be seen and bought at Kojis in the fine jewellery
department in Harrods in London, where there is an exhibition of her work.
Even there you could buy a silver ring for as little as Pounds 30. Other
pieces start at Pounds 100 and there is a biggish selection for under Pounds
500.
Finally, you might like to consider the work of Barbara Christie, head of
jewellery at the well-known Morley College in London who also makes
jewellery for private customers to commission in her studio at home. How To
Spend It readers may have seen her work at the many fairs at which she
exhibits such as the Goldsmiths Fair and Chelsea Arts Fair.
Her style, as you can see from the two photographs here, is spare, simple
and strong. She uses precious and non-precious metals and stones as well as
Chinese river pearls and gemstones. Her latest jewellery explores the theme
of 'boxes' - textured 'box' brooches which are divided into tiny windowed
compartments, each featuring collectibles such as gold or silver dust,
miniature jewelled hearts and corals. Then there is a collection of square
bangles with gold corners, diamond tipped rings, cufflinks, earrings and
chains all based on what she calls the 'Neo-Classics.'
For those who prefer to spend money on something really useful she also
makes a range of cutlery, napkin rings, paper knives, fruit knives and knife
rests. For chaps there is a collection of bar cufflinks in 18 carat gold on
steel.
Her prices start at Pounds 95 and the most expensive of her pieces is Pounds
850 but a really fine one-off piece of jewellery could be commissioned for
well under Pounds 200. Contact her at her home, 12 Dukes Avenue, London W4
2AE, tel: 081-994 3498.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Fashion: Big girls really can have more fun - A new focus on
the fuller figure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BAIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW fashion shop will open on the high streets of towns and cities in the
UK this month. Each store will be called Ann Harvey, with a smart cream and
gold fascia and stylish window displays. Only closer inspection of the
clothes and the swing tickets will reveal that the shop specialises in
outsizes - specifically sizes 16 to 26.
Ann Harvey has been born out of the Alexon Group and, over the next 12
months, aims to grow to be a 60-strong chain. It is a deliberate decision
not to herald the fact that Ann Harvey is for larger women.
'We want to create a stigma-free shopping environment from day one,' says
Mike Spencer, marketing director. 'We are a new fashion brand first and
foremost, and, by the way, we cater for large sizes. With the fashion trend
for fluid garments, there is no reason why size 12 and 14 women shouldn't
shop with us as well.'
Ann Harvey clothes are middle market and are aimed at the 25- to
50-year-olds, with a core target of 30- to 45-year-olds. The range is
similar in styling and price to the fashion collections in stores such as
Next, Principles or Wallis.
The fabrics are good quality - silk jersey separates, silk and linen
knitwear, Japanese polyester/viscose suitings, moss and satin-backed crepe
fit-and-flare dresses featuring abalone buttons. Evening wear is strong,
ranging from a sexy short velvet number to a sophisticated tuxedo dress and
a variety of chiffon separates.
'Quality of fabric and detailing is very important in this collection,' says
fashion director Lesley Thomson, 'as so often quality is sacrificed for
price, almost as if there were a stigma attached to being large.' That there
is a stigma at all is because society purveys the message that thin is good.
Audrey Winkler, editor of Pretty Big magazine, says she is impressed with
the quality of the Ann Harvey range. There is a great need for something
like a Next for larger women, she says: clothes that are smart, fashionable
and middle priced. 'Large women are women first and large second, they are
no different to anyone else and they want more choice in fashion.'
And there are a lot of them. For any fashion retailer addressing the larger
woman, the most difficult problem to overcome is her frequent lack of
confidence. Even now, when many are having the courage to take a symbolic
axe to the bathroom scales (98 per cent of diets fail anyway), a great many
continue to put their lives on hold, waiting for the day when they too will
be thin.
Tessa Bosworth, buyer for the Plus Collections in Harrods, who is herself a
large size, says the larger woman needs to be reassured and encouraged to
try on the clothes, because often even expensive designs have little hanger
appeal.
With that in mind the Plus department in Harrods in London has been extended
and refurbished and this autumn will carry the new American Theo Miles Plus
collection. Laura Pomerantz, executive vice-president, says that the Plus
range is virtually identical to the Theo Miles standard size range (which
will be stocked in department stores around the UK). But it is specially cut
for the size 18 to 26 woman 'who I find is more fashion driven than other
customers, and has only been limited by selection. Just because she is fully
figured doesn't mean that she doesn't want tailored jackets and trousers:
they will look good on her in the right proportions and colours.'
As far as confidence is concerned, a lot has to do with the name. Evans, up
to now the only national retail chain catering for large sizes, jettisoned
the 'Outsize' part of its name more than ten years ago, replacing it with
'Collection'.
Yet Evans is still dogged by the ghost. The Evans range has much improved;
there are ongoing shop refurbishments and image-enchancing advertorials have
appeared in quality magazines. Yet some customers still insist on turning
the carrier bags inside out rather than venturing on to the high street
carrying the Evans name.
Janice Bhend, editor of Yes], a new consumer magazine for large women,
believes that Evans will never lose the old image unless the name is
changed. She suggests that Profiles - a sub-brand within the store - would
be a good substitute.
Hennes takes a subtle approach with its larger sized range - Big Is
Beautiful (BiB) - which was launched in the UK in spring last year. The
department is not even listed on the store directory board at the entrance
to the shops.
The BiB range is wonderful for casualwear, from jeans and leggings to chunky
knitwear, separates and some soft suits. It is also very well made - which
is just as well, as the prices are considerably higher than Hennes' main
line: Pounds 69.95 for a jacket compared with an average of Pounds 39.95.
Psychology also comes into it: size 16 is a small, 18 is medium, 20/22 large
and 24/26 extra large.
For women who prefer to shop at home - or who cannot face the high street -
there have, until recently, only been the traditional mail order catalogues
offering a limited and hardly high-fashion selection. Now there is Elegance,
an up-market mail-order catalogue from Germany which also has a shop in
Grafton Street, London W1. The collection includes fabulous tailoring and
quality casualwear; sizes start at 8 and go up to 22. The company is
planning a fashion show in September with models of size 10 and size 20 to
prove the clothes look equally good on both.
The visual presentation of large-sized clothes is a sensitive issue. Jacques
Vert was criticised last year when it launched its Plus collection
photographed on Rachel Hunter (Mrs Rod Stewart). Susie Orbach, author of Fat
is a Feminist Issue, was quoted at the time as saying: 'They are
perpetrating the very aesthetic they are ostensibly fighting against - that
there is only one form of beauty.' Yet mail-order company GUS says it tried
photographing its Fashion Extra catalogue on large models some years back,
and sales plummeted: now the models are back to being size 12 and sales have
risen. Catch 22?
Slowly, there is beginning to be more choice in fashion for large women, and
for this one can probably thank the recession, as retailers look to tap
every market in order to boost sales.
River Island is launching an XL collection, Wallis is introducing a size 18
(which will probably fit a size 20), and the Sears women's wear division -
which encompasses Wallis, Warehouse, Richards and Miss Selfridge - is
rumoured to be planning an outsize retail chain. Information: Ann Harvey
will open in 21 locations between October and November this year. These are:
Birmingham, Bolton, Brighton, Bristol, Bromley, Canterbury, Cardiff,
Chester, Crawley, Hemel Hempstead, Ilford, Leeds, Manchester, Meadowhall,
Milton Keynes, Nottingham, Staines, Thurrock, Tunbridge Wells, Watford and
York.
The Theo Miles Plus collection will be available in Harrods and Selfridges
in London from September. The standard size Theo Miles range will also be
available in these stores as well as John Lewis, Dickins and Jones, Barkers
of Kensington, Bentalls of Kingston, Dingles of Plymouth, Rackhams of
Birmingham, McKilroys of Swindon, Hourstons of Ayr, Hanningtons in Brighton,
Owen Owen in Ipswich, Coventry, Slough and Ilford, Lewis's of Leeds and
Liverpool, Arnotts in Dublin, Beatties in Wolverhampton, Clements in
Watford, Nasons in Canterbury, Bentalls in Bracknell and Thurrock. The Theo
Miles Petite collection is available from David Morgan in Cardiff.
Elegance is available from the shop at 14a Grafton Street London W1 (off
Bond Street) or by mail order catalogue: tel: 0272-244747 or fax:
0272-245929.
The Big is Beautiful collection is available at the following Hennes stores:

Whitgift Centre, Croydon. Further information on 071-323-2211.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Fashion: A small degree of formality - Nigel Spivey checks
out the sartorial students in the class of '93
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL SPIVEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STUDENTS IN the class of '93 are smarter than their predecessors. That is
broadly the consensus from High Table, though it requires immediate
qualification.
Senior dons can remember beyond the sartorially-disastrous 1960s to an age
when the suit and tie were not hallmarks of the prig or the fogey but normal
student uniform. Cambridge town had a rich weave of gentlemen's outfitters,
whose very names evoked a certain style. One can readily imagine what sort
of clothes would come out of a shop called Bodger's. But Bodger's is gone,
and so too the concept of the 'young gentleman'. Elderly dons may bemoan the
loss, but townsfolk tend not to regret the passing of all the associated
snobbery.
Certainly today's undergraduates are better presented than they were in my
time. Then it was not unusual for characters to slouch into a lecture-room
wearing only a black plastic binliner (and a torn binliner at that). It was
the eve of Margaret Thatcher's first election victory: and punk flourished
in all its reckless plumage.
A decade and a half of Conservatism has dampened the spirit of adventure,
though some residual traces of punk survive. I have a soft spot for a tiny
tribe called the Goths, who specialise in entirely black garments and
cascades of pewter jewellery worn over shockingly pallid skin.
Then there is Grunge: a sort of gaudy drabness, if that makes sense, which
is favoured by what little remains of the student activist movement. It
features clumpy, cushion-soled footwear, vaguely ethnic skirts and drapes,
and beaded neo-hippy hairstyles. At its best Grunge seems like a glorious
plundering of a dressing-up box; at its worst, the wearer looks the sort who
probably ought to be arrested on sight.
Categorisation of degree choices by external appearance is still possible.
The Heavy Metal or Tolkien T-shirt worn over chronically-hunched shoulders
invariably indicates the male computer scientist. And the fragrant
assemblage of boots, jodhpurs, hacking jacket and Florentine silk scarf can
only belong to a female art historian.
However, the prevalent style is easily described by those dons who have
visited American Ivy League universities: 'Preppy', a generally sporty look
which simply requires loafers or deck-shoes at the base, designer jeans in
the middle, and something loose fitting on top.
Oh, and a suntan. Simple, and studiously casual, but not cheap, as anyone
who has ventured to gain a suntan or buy a pair of Timberlands will know.
Preppy is not a look that can be cobbled together from the Oxfam charity
shops. But it is significant that Oxfam shops in many university towns now
specialise in selling almost pristine formal evening wear. The generation of
the 1950s which bequeathed its ball gowns and dinner jackets to Oxfam must
be gratified to see their adoption by Thatcher's proteges. Smart casual may
be the order of the day, but smart formal has made a remarkable return for
the night. Bodger's may have gone, but blue-blooded elegance is not dead.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Software to ask hard questions /
A look at a problem-solving package - Computing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN BROOKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FRIEND called to see me the other week. He was down at heart. He was
thinking of quitting his business - a business he had put a lot of work into
over the last eight years.
His problem, the same one which faces many businesses during the recession,
was a fall-off in sales and more recently, in spite of a great deal of
effort on his part, even inquiries for his products were slowing down.
A new piece of business software called Business Insight had been delivered
to me earlier that week and l needed to try it out with real data. Would my
friend act as a guinea-pig? He agreed and we sat down together to run
through the program.
Business Insight is a software package that has been available in the US for
a year or so. The new Windows version has just found a distributor in the
UK. It is a system for the strategic analysis of both manufacturing and
service industries.
My friend's background is in sales and marketing. He was familiar with many
of the ideas behind the questions. He had come across them over the years at
various seminars and had read about them in the books of business gurus such
as Drucker, Peters and Porter. But, he never asked those questions of his
own business. Even if they were answered how could he interpret them: how
could he rate the importance of each point?
As we ploughed through the question and answer routine, he saw where some of
the questions were leading.
The program is not one you can complete in a few minutes. If you include
time spent thinking about the answers the process of inputting the data
takes several hours.
It requires answers to questions about the abilities of all those involved
with your business from the financial director to the receptionist answering
the customer service inquiries. It needs details of your competitors, their
financial position and how likely they are to retaliate to your marketing
efforts.
The result of all the data is a report developed after the program has
carried out the analysis. It program assesses the data and produces a
report. This is contains more than 70 pages of valuable information in plain
English.
How is my friend doing now?
His greatest attribute is that he does not sit around waiting for something
to happen. He read the report over that weekend and immediately instigated
some of its recommendations. Only four weeks later he has several inquiries
about his machines. He is demonstrating them to his potential customers this
coming week.
We cannot be sure that my friend's upturn is a result of using the program -
but it seems a little more than mere coincidence.
Business Insight costs Pounds 399 plus VAT and carriage from CABC, PO Box

FT  09 OCT 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Trophies of a dying art - Clive
Fewins meets a taxidermist who keeps his stock in the freezers of his
friends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PAUL Draper will never forget the day he collected the carcass of an 8 cwt
two-year-old male tiger from the owners of a large circus. He had ample help
to lead the body on to his pick-up truck at the circus headquarters, but
when he arrived back at his workshop he had great problems finding people to
help with the unloading.
The process that followed was rapid and rather unsavoury, but the beast now
has a new role - mounted in a glass cabinet in the showroom at his home near
Reading where he displays his taxidermy. The price is Pounds 3,000. As he
paid only Pounds 250 for the carcass some people might consider taxidermy a
lucrative business. But Draper points out that it is two years since he
bought the tiger and it is still unsold. Further, about 160 hours of work
went into mounting it and the glass case alone cost some Pounds 500.
The tiger, together with a panther at Pounds 3,500, exotic birds, an
anteater, a sloth's head, as well as the more common foxes, badgers, stoats
and the odd kestrel and buzzard, forms the basis of the bizarre stock of
mounted creatures in Draper's showroom.
The stock is valued at Pounds 25,000 and is the main reason for the Pounds
1,500 a year insurance bill that is the principal outgoing of Draper's
one-man business. Keeping a stock valued at Pounds 25,000 when the total
turnover is unlikely to exceed Pounds 30,000 this year might not, on the
face of it, seem a good basis for business. But that is not the whole story.
In a dozen freezers in the garages of friends in and around Reading, Draper
keeps some 150 or so other dead animals and animal skins. Any of them can be
converted into fully mounted animals within a few weeks, and it is his
ability to respond to demand in this way that is the mainstay of Animal
Instincts.
Draper has built up this macabre collection in the 10 years he has been a
taxidermist. Over that time he has learned which animals sell and which are
best left on ice until a specific request comes up.
'The reason for my large stock of mounted animals is that I need it as the
basis of shows and as a permanent exhibit in my home to show people the
quality of my work,' said Draper, 37. 'Two years ago when I gave up the shop
in Reading that I had run for eight years I was carrying a stock of mounted
animals worth Pounds 40,000.
'I managed to reduce that by selling off stock worth Pounds 30,000 to a film
hire company, but it has gradually built up again.'
A high street presence played a vital role in building up the business. Over
the years the sales often barely covered the Pounds 10,000 a year rent. But
the exercise was still worthwhile as Draper, who is a goldsmith by trade,
also used the premises as the headquarters of the jewellery repair service
he was operating as a parallel enterprise.
'I very much doubt if I would be as prosperous as I am now if I had not run
the shop for eight years,' Draper said.
In the same way he has had a stand at the annual Newbury show for the past
five years, but it was only this September's event that made a good profit -
Pounds 1,600 worth of sales over the two days, and lots of follow-up callers
to his showroom. Two years ago he gave up the shop and sold the jewellery
repair business. He invested the proceeds of the sale in converting the roof
space of his Edwardian house into a showroom.
'It was a wise move,' Draper said. 'I am in an excellent position here, two
minutes from junction 11 of the M4 and on the edge of the countryside.
People are happy to drive here to view the stock. It saves me an awful lot
of driving.
'Although it was necessary for a few years the shop was a treadmill. At
times the rent was approaching half my turnover and there was constant
pressure to sell at any price just to make money to pay the bills. I was
working all hours, whereas nowadays I can choose. If there is a rush on I do
not mind working until one or two in the morning, but if I choose not to and
to earn less, I can do so.'
Experience has made Draper far more choosy over the animals he goes out to
collect. 'I am contracted to collect everything from the zoos and aviaries
with which I have an arrangement. But nowadays I go out less frequently to
collect animals offered to me by individuals,' he said. 'Overall only 20 to
30 per cent of all the carcasses I collect are usable. The rest have to be
disposed of in a farm incinerator.'
Draper said none of his specimens are killed for the purposes of taxidermy,
though many of the carcasses that come to him have been killed for sport,
while others such as foxes, stoats and weasels have been killed for vermin
control. But who nowadays wants to buy stuffed animals?
'If they are really keen people rarely stick to one animal but generally try
to build up small collections. Like me they tend to be people who are
interested in animals and appreciate them for their beauty,' Draper said.
'There is also an ever-increasing market from the theatre, film studios,
photographic and advertising agencies and the hire business.
'If I wanted to make a lot more money I would concentrate on that side of
the business and also on making models and mock-ups. There is a high demand
for these, but I find that sort of work less satisfying. The customers are
generally less interested in quality than price. That sort of work gets away
from the art of taxidermy, which that is what I really enjoy - plus the
beauty of the end product.
'It is however - literally - a dying trade. This is because there is more
and more control of the keeping of live animals, and on what you are allowed
to do with them when they die.
'Because demand is steadily dropping and the work is so labour-intensive I
never expect to be rich. But I reckon I make 60 per cent profit on turnover,
and some aspects of the business, like repair work, which I enjoy, can be
very profitable. 'If I were hell-bent on expanding fast the easy way I would
be tempted to buy carcasses that had been killed illegally. But I am
absolutely against this. Besides, I do not think there is a lot of money in
it.
'For similar reasons I rarely pay for carcasses. It might encourage people
to go out an kill deliberately in order to sell to me.' Draper says another
reason why taxidermy is on the decline is that there is virtually no formal
training.
'Most museum departments have closed down and I do not know of any technical
colleges offering courses in taxidermy,' he said. 'Nearly all practitioners,
like me, work on their own. Colleagues fear, as I do, that with so little
training available standards will gradually get more and more amateurish.
'When people see animals mounted as though they have got coathangers stuck
up their backs they will gradually cease to collect.
'Sadly, taxidermists are themselves becoming an endangered species.'

FT  09 OCT 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Double tax on back pay
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I WORK FOR a regional health board and recently won an appeal to have my pay
grade raised from grade G to grade H. The appeal took five years to resolve.
In consequence, I received back money for the whole time in a single lump
sum.
Because of this single payment, l have estimated that my total gross
earnings for the tax year ending March 31 1994 will be well over the 40 per
cent tax band.
This is a ridiculous state of affairs which is going to cost me over Pounds
1,000 in extra tax. If the money had been paid in the year in which it was
earned, I would never have approached the higher tax band.
This seems to be unfair to me. Surprisingly, the tax office also thinks it
is unfair but says its hands are tied and can do nothing about it. Is there
any way I can avoid paying this extra tax?
Under the penal provisions of section 38 of the Finance Act 1989, the back
pay for the period up to April 5 1989 is taxable twice: both for the tax
year (ended April 5) in which it was earned and for the tax year in which it
was actually paid.
So, the combined tax rate could be 65 per cent (25 per cent for 1988-89 plus
40 per cent for 1993-94) plus national insurance.
We suggest you write to your MP, inviting him/her to ask the chancellor to
amend section 38 of the 1989 act so as to give some relief from the full
double taxation of back pay which his predecessor decided upon (with the
approval of the House of Commons) 4 1/2 years ago.
You should also write to the Inland Revenue Public Enquiry Room, Somerset
House, Strand, London, WC2R 1LB, for SP1/92 (Directors' and employees'
emoluments: extension of time limits for relief on transition to receipts
basis of assessment), although we are sorry to say it might depress you.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Unwanted benefit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE received a tax assessment requesting back payment of Pounds 244 for
1990/92. This is for benefit in kind, which I now understand to be
membership of a private medical insurer supplied free to employees by my
former employer.
I was never given the opportunity to decline this benefit. Being healthy, I
never required the service. Could you could advise me if this tax assessment
is correct?
Yes; unfortunately the fact that a benefit provided by an employer is
unwanted by, and useless to, an employee does not relieve the employee of
the obligation to pay the amount of tax laid down by parliament in respect
of that particular type of benefit.
Ask your tax office for the free explanatory pamphlet 480 (Guide to expenses
payments and benefits for directors and certain employees).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I WISH TO transfer some shares to relatives. Am I able to do this simply by
completing a stock transfer form and sending it to the registrar (the shares
are in plcs quoted on the London Stock Exchange). Is stamp duty to be paid
and, if so, how?
Do I have to go to a stamp office? How is the transfer altered if the
transaction is not at market value?
If the shares are being transferred by way of gift, you merely have to
complete the stamp-duty exemption certificate on the back of each transfer
form (as well as completing the front of the form, of course) and then hand
it and the share certificate over to your relative so that he/she can send
them to the registrar. If the transfer is not by way of a gift, stamp duty
is payable at one-half per cent, in units of 50p. Stamping can be arranged
through the Post Office, if need be.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Setting up a will trust
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I WOULD like your opinion about setting up a will discretionary trust into
which the first spouse to die puts his/her Pounds 150,000 allowance, with
the trustees ensuring that the surviving spouse has the use of the interest
and capital. Presumably, the surviving spouse could not be one of the
trustees.
What do you think of the scheme, and does the Inland Revenue approve? All
our investments are held jointly, but I am told they need to be divided
before a trust is formed.
We assume that your intention in setting up a discretionary trust such as
you describe is to utilise your Pounds 150,000 nil rate band in the most
tax-efficient manner while, at the same time, retaining an element of
flexibility as to whom you wish to benefit.
Provided that you have divided your assets (a preliminary step which, I am
afraid, is necessary) it would be possible to set up a trust under your will
and you could settle Pounds 150,000. We assume that the remaining part of
your estate is to be transferred to your wife.
In setting up a trust, your wife could be nominated as a beneficiary and you
could leave a letter of wishes with the trustees, directing them to exercise
their discretion in making payments to her from time to time. But she would
have no legal entitlement to such payments.
Obviously, in such a case, your wife's position would be somewhat
precarious; and if her livelihood depended upon inheriting your share of the
jointly-owned assets, then the discretionary trust is not a device which
would suit you.
If you wish your wife to have a legal entitlement in the trust, then the
creation of a life interest in her favour is necessary. This, however, would
negate the tax planning achieved by setting up a discretionary trust in the
first place.
This is because the trust funds in which the life interest subsists would be
regarded as forming part of her estate on her death (which result would have
occurred, anyway, if your assets were still owned jointly).

FT  09 OCT 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Chased by the Revenue
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE death of my parents in 1987, the small family company was put into
liquidation. The Inland Revenue has requested the final accounts, as it
knows there were substantial funds in the kitty which have not shown up on
my tax returns. The liquidators have been contacted many times, with no
positive results.
With the Revenue breathing quite heavily down my neck, I was wondering if
there is an organisation which would stir the chartered accountants out of
their apparent apathy.
If you believe the advisers are acting too slowly, you might wish to contact
the Institute of Chartered Accountants, Chartered Accountants' Hall,
Moorgate Place, London, EC2P 2BS, setting out the facts and asking for
advice on how to proceed. We assume you have informed the Inland Revenue of
the situation?
This reply was provided by Barry Stillerman of accountant Stoy Hayward.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: The pitfalls in tax planning - Care
is needed if you are to avoid breaching the Revenue's rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE GARNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST PEOPLE would prefer to pay less tax, whether it be on income, capital
gains tax or inheritance. But non-declaration is not the solution. This is
tax evasion and, if discovered, could result in an assessment for the tax,
interest and penalties - or even prison.
There are exemptions for each form of tax. For example, personal allowances
can be set off against income tax; gains on gifts of private company shares
can be deferred; and there is total relief from inheritance tax for
agricultural property.
You might think that if you could plan your financial affairs to take
advantage of these exemptions, you would have to pay less tax. The answer is
 -yes, provided you do not try to push the exemptions to extremes.
Late in the 1970s, when tax rates went as high as 98 per cent, avoidance was
big business. Tax planners became ever more ingenious with every success,
with the result that even complex tax avoidance schemes could be bought 'off
the peg.'
Very often, these involved several steps which had little or no commercial
purpose other than to avoid tax, and the taxpayer often had no idea of the
legal effect of various steps involved.
A series of cases - most notably, Ramsay in 1982 - put a stop to these
schemes.
In the Ramsay case, the House of Lords decided that the Inland Revenue could
treat a tax avoidance scheme involving several steps as a single composite
transaction. By ignoring the steps taken in the middle designed to make use
of exemptions, the scheme became taxable.
As a result, schemes stopped being sold, tax avoidance became a dirty word,
and a number of cases were brought to the courts to test the parameters of
what became known as the Ramsay principle. It was quickly agreed that the
Ramsay principle did not apply to simple tax planning involving only one
step.
If, for example, you were thinking of providing for your daughter out of
your share portfolio while you went to work in Hong Kong, you would be well
advised to give her the shares after you had become non-UK resident. Capital
gains tax is not payable by non-UK residents (unless there is a specific
anti-avoidance provision which specifies to the contrary).
What about more complex tax planning making use of several steps? To what
extent does the Ramsay principle curtail our freedom to re-arrange our
financial affairs to mitigate tax?
To give an example of more complex tax planning: there is a relief from CGT
for gifts of private company shares, although this is not available if your
gift is to a non-UK resident. The residence of a company is defined by where
it is managed and controlled, regardless of where the shares are registered.
This means that gifts of private company shares to companies incorporated
abroad, but managed and controlled in the UK, will still attract relief.
A UK resident who is not domiciled in the UK pays CGT or IHT only on UK
assets and not on his global assets (so long as the gains are not brought
into the UK). Shares are UK assets or non-UK assets, depending on where the
company is registered.
If, therefore, you have a successful business in the UK which you own
through a private company, and you wish to give or sell the shares without
CGT or IHT consequences, you could (if you are UK-resident but domiciled
elsewhere) first set up a Jersey-registered company managed and controlled
by you in the UK. Second, you give your UK shares to your Jersey company
and, third, you give or sell your Jersey company shares to someone else.
Is this last step free of IHT and CGT consequences, or does the Ramsay
principle apply? In short, if you could be sure at the time you took step
one that step three would be taken, the answer is that Ramsay would apply
and that tax would be payable but, if not, then it would not.
For example, if at the time you did the above scheme, you had not identified
a purchaser (or, if identified, the buyer was not committed to buying the
shares), then the Ramsay principle would probably not apply and tax would
not be payable.
This principle was applied most recently to inheritance tax in the case of
Countess Fitzwilliam v. Inland Revenue. This involved a tailor-made scheme
designed to avoid capital transfer tax (the predecessor to IHT) payable on
the death of Earl Fitzwilliam.
It made use of two exemptions (the reverter to settlor provisions and the
mutual transfer provisions) and involved complex strategic tax planning by
Countess Fitzwilliam and Lady Hastings, her daughter.
The important point in this case was that although the scheme was
tailor-made for Countess Fitzwilliam, Lady Hastings had been advised
separately and understood precisely what was involved in each step.
In his judgment, Lord Keith said the Revenue could not pick and choose from
a scheme the bits it liked or did not like, and refuse to apply tax
exemptions just because it was a 'pre-planned tax avoidance scheme'.
UK tax legislation is among the most sophisticated in the world, with many
and clever anti-avoidance provisions, traps and pitfalls. The problem with
devising a scheme is that by escaping one tax, you could fall foul of
another.
This does not mean that strategic tax planning is impossible; far from it.
However, it is not advisable unless you can afford good advice, are prepared
to take time to understand the details of how and why tax can be avoided,
and appreciate fully the risks you are taking.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Diary of a Private Investor: Why directors bear watching -
Kevin Goldstein-Jackson explains the importance of a company's board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THE BOARD meetings used to start at 3 pm and sometimes went on until almost
midnight. The managing director did not believe in capital expenditure. He
did not understand the need for the latest machinery: he thought efficiency
meant counting the paper clips and sacking staff.
'There was no way I could reach the main board. My division was propping up
the rest of the company - but the boardroom was reserved for friends and
relatives of the chairman.'
MORE THAN a decade ago, I heard comments like these when I was interviewing
applicants for the positions of company secretary and financial director of
a public quoted company of which I was the founder. It occurred to me then
that the business with the greatest ability to acquire insider information
was not banking or stockbroking but executive recruitment.
Many applicants for a highly-paid position will tell their prospective
employer almost anything he wants to know: it will not all be sour grapes
and moans. Some people explained to me how their employer was proposing to
launch a new product, or had plans to expand by takeover into new areas of
activity.
I even heard boasts about how 'wizard wheezes' were devised to keep a
certain amount of debt off the balance sheet of their companies, and how
auditors had been persuaded to agree that stocks should be valued at rather
more than they were really worth. (But I hasten to add that the successful
applicants for the positions in my company did not reveal anything untoward
about their previous employers).
I learnt a lot about human nature and the interaction between various
members of company boards. I did not act on any of the inside information -
except to steer clear of investing in any of the companies about which I
heard believable 'horror' tales. But it impressed upon me the importance of
a company's board.
Before investing in a company, I always try to find out something about its
directors. Bitter experience has shown that following the 'great and the
good' is no way to investment success. Just because there is a lord on the
board does not necessarily mean the company will do well. Perhaps the
'names' are there as window dressing to distract attention from some of the
things going on behind the scenes - or to impress gullible bankers into
granting the company yet more loans. The same is true for boards stuffed
with accountants: their companies may well produce a lacklustre performance,
and some have even gone into receivership.
I am a regular reader of the 'People' column in the FT. It surprises me how
easy it appears to be for some finance directors of poorly-performing
companies to move to similar positions elsewhere. But managing directors of
ailing companies rarely seem to do this - they seem to be saddled with the
entire blame for their company's performance. Yet, surely the finance
directors are partly to blame, too?
Sometimes, these moves can be a signal to buy or sell shares. If the finance
director is bailing out, does this indicate that a company's financial
situation might deteriorate still further? Or will it be refreshed by new
blood? What influence might such a finance director have on his new
employer? Should the shares be treated with more caution?
There are times when the appointment of new directors can point to an
otherwise unexpected direction for the company. Perhaps the director has
been recruited with expertise in a specific area of activity in which the
company is not yet involved. Is this a prelude to the company making a
takeover bid in that area? If so, it might be worth investigating possible
bid targets to assess their investment potential.
What is the track record of the director being appointed? Is he likely to
improve the performance of the company - or is he there mainly to make it
more likely that the company's remuneration committee approves a huge salary
for the chief executive?
I am against non-executive chairmen receiving large salaries, particularly
if they have various other commitments and devote only one or two days a
month to the company. One unjustifiably large salary invariably leads to
other people being overpaid.
Before investing in the company, I also look at its annual report to see how
many of the directors have shares in it. I like to see even the
non-executives having a modest holding, especially if these are shares which
were acquired on similar terms to ordinary shareholders and not as a result
of over-generous option schemes.
Share dealings by directors also interest me. I am particularly concerned
when they sell large parts of their holdings in a company: do they fear it
is about to hit hard times?
Share purchases by directors are more problematical. Sometimes, these deals
will have had a lot of publicity and people may be led to believe the
company concerned has good prospects. But perhaps the director concerned had
sold a lot of his shares earlier at a hefty profit and is just buying some
back at a lower price.
The BRI Director Dealings unit trust, launched on October 1, specialises in
monitoring share dealings by directors of public companies. Most firms of
stockbrokers and other financial advisers have details of this trust, which
is being marketed mainly via financial intermediarites. Its list of major
shareholdings could eventually become a very useful check on companies in
which directors have affirmed their faith by backing them with their own
money.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Rates cut at Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S of London is cutting its premium rates for life insurance by up to
14 per cent, to help it compete with other life insurers. The largest
reductions are in Keyman cover, where companies insure top employees or
directors to protect against financial loss if they die. The average
reduction for standard life premiums is 5 per cent.
The nine syndicates which make up Lloyd's life insurance market offer only
term insurance, rather than the whole of life policies also offered by other
insurance companies. The maximum term is 10 years, but individuals can be
insured for as short a period as one day.
Lloyd's has specialised traditionally in arranging flexible cover for
unusual risks which most insurers would not consider. Anyone planning to
join a relief convoy to Bosnia next week would not be welcomed by most of
the big-name life insurance companies, but Lloyd's is used to accepting that
kind of risk - although standard premiums would, of course, be raised.
The short-term cover can also be useful if the increased risk is for a
limited period: say, a three-week trip to a war zone or a day's parachuting
for charity. Cover can be arranged through traditional Lloyd's brokers or
through other insurance brokers or financial intermediaries.
As an example of the reduced rates, a non-smoking man aged 45 next birthday,
and wanting a sum assured of Pounds 250,000 over five years, would pay an
annual premium of Pounds 562.50 rather than the previous Pounds 642.50.
Women are now rated as if they were five years younger than men, rather than
four as previously.

<TEXT>
THE MARKET has inched its way up again and some directors have been tempted
to take profits. Michael Slade, managing director of property group Helical
Bar, sold 245,000 ordinary shares at 250p and a further 260,000 of the
convertible preference at 91p. Helical Bar has been beset by a high level of
debt, but substantial sales have been made and borrowing reduced. The market
has already begun to discount this, with the shares outperforming by at
least 250 per cent over the past 12 months.
William Adsetts, chairman of Sheffield Insulations, and his managing
director, William Forrester, have sold a significant lump of shares. Adsetts
disposed of 1.15m at 230p, which leaves him with a holding of over 4m.
Forrester, on the other hand, exercised an option on 50,000 and sold the
lot, again at 230p.
This building materials group has shown a big increase in profitability.
Recent interim results showed earnings doubled at 5.5p. Improved
profitability was largely discounted by the shares, which have outperformed
during the year.
Charles Greigson, director of money broking group MAI, has sold 175,000
shares at 228p.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Taking risks on futures - The
Speculator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN actor Eddie Murphy stepped into a futures dealing pit to became a
millionaire in the film Trading Places, he seemed to be at the sharp end of
a modern and sophisticated financial instrument.
In fact, the first futures contracts are said to have been sold by Japanese
rice farmers in the 16th century. The first organised futures fund was
established in the US, and it is there that the market is most developed.
A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a fixed quantity of a
certain commodity, currency or security for delivery at a specified date at
a fixed price. The system was devised to protect farmers against volatility
in commodity prices.
The farmer would agree to sell a proportion of his crop at a fixed price on
a fixed date. The consumer also wanted to know the price he would have to
pay once the crop was harvested so it was in his interests, too, to fix a
price.
The futures market could also be used to hedge risk. Everyone is familiar
with the concept of hedging against inflation by investing in equities or
bonds to protect capital against a rise in inflation.
Liquidity in futures markets is provided by speculators who, in order to try
to make a profit, are willing to take on the risk of those who are hedging.
One reason speculators are attracted to futures is that they need to provide
only a fraction of the money needed to buy the contract.
Say a speculator pledges to buy coffee at Dollars 50 a ton in six months; he
may only need to put up only Dollars 5 initially. If the price of coffee
doubles during that period, he can sell the contract before delivery for
Dollars 100 and get the full benefit of the rise. So, he will have made
Dollars 50 for an outlay of only Dollars 5.
Although the price of the contract has only doubled, he has profited from a
tenfold increase. This process is known as margin trading and has earned
futures its reputation for risk because, if the price had moved against him,
he could have lost many times his original stake.
Futures contracts today are often for hundreds of thousands of dollars or
pounds but private investors can enter the market for considerably less
through a futures fund. The minimum investment will usually be around
Dollars 5,000-10,000. A fund invests in a range of futures - mostly
financial which, in the UK, are traded on the London International Financial
Futures Exchange.
Given the risk, why should anyone want to invest in futures? Despite their
volatile image, futures funds can be used to lessen risk because some
futures do not necessarily move in line with other markets.
'Futures tend to show low correlation with equity and bond markets,' says
Nicola Meaden, managing director of TASS, a London-based information and
research house which has developed an index to monitor the performance of
funds. 'They can, therefore, be used to reduce risk by increasing diversity
in a portfolio.'
Peter Swete, chairman of Sabre Fund managers - a UK-based futures manager
which is 25 per cent owned by Henderson - adds: 'People buy us as they would
an emerging markets fund or property. We can also provide high leverage and
high risk if that is what the investor wants.'
In order to meet investors' anxieties over risk, the market has tried to
expand by constructing 'guaranteed' futures funds. These promise to return
capital at the end of a specified period (usually five years) while holding
out the prospect for profits during that period.
Most non-US futures funds are based offshore. It was not until 1991 that the
Securities and Investments Board, the chief regulator for the financial
services industry in the UK, allowed unit trusts to invest in futures and
options. The SIB authorised two types of fund: unleveraged futures and
options funds (Fofs) and leveraged funds (Gfofs). Guaranteed funds are not
yet permitted onshore.
Next week: the different types of futures funds.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Wanted - more trustees / Debbie
Harrison explores the finer points of running a pension scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOLLOWING publication last week of the Goode committee's report on pensions
law, the government is expected to call for more occupational scheme members
to become trustees in order to improve the security of UK pension funds.
A trust cannot exist without a trustee who, as legal owner of the fund, is
obliged to look after the assets on behalf of the 'beneficiaries' - the
present members, deferred members (ex-employees who have left behind their
accrued rights), and retired employees drawing pensions. At present, an
estimated 300,000 trustees act as guardians of combined UK pension fund
assets worth Pounds 400bn.
The Goode report recommended that, for final salary schemes where the
employer promises to provide pensions linked to final pay, members should
make up one-third of the trustee board. Under money purchase schemes, where
the pension is determined by the investment returns of contributions, the
report recommended two-thirds of trustees should be members.
Most large schemes consider appointing trustees to be good practice even
though it is not compulsory. Smaller companies, however, often draw most of
their trustees from management, a situation that can lead to abuse. If the
company is cash-poor but pensions-rich, it might be tempting for the
management trustee to use the fund to bolster the flagging corporate
finances.
The first and most important point for prospective trustees is that their
responsibility is to the beneficiaries, not the employers. Patrick Day was a
member trustee for Tate &amp; Lyle's main UK pension scheme - a fund with Pounds
400m and 10,000 beneficiaries - for eight years before he retired. Since
then, he has continued his role as a pensioner trustee.
Day says: 'There is a great deal to learn. The most difficult decisions
involved the discretionary benefits - for example, over who should receive
the death or ill-health benefits in marginal cases. This is where the member
trustees' knowledge of the work force really comes into play.'
Tate &amp; Lyle's fund already has 50 per cent member trustees, who are elected
by a committee. Day explains: 'The committee looks for someone with a lot of
common sense who is prepared to make the necessary commitment to study the
trust deed and rules and to keep up with legislation.'
Ron Skelton is a member trustee and chairman of the trustee board for a
subsidiary of Siemens, the electrical group. He says: 'It is easy to become
over-awed when you are sitting around the table with the top management. You
need to have the confidence that can come only from knowledge.'
Day and Skelton have attended trustee training courses, and both have
studied for (and passed) the Pensions Management Institute (PMI) Trustee
Certificate of Basic Pensions Knowledge* - a relatively new course designed
to cover the essential facts trustees must know.
John Cunliffe, a partner with pensions solicitor McKenna and Co. and author
of the National Association of Pension Funds' (NAPF) guide for trustees**,
says: 'As a member trustee, you are not expected to be an expert, but you
should be honest, competent and interested in your scheme. Your first job is
to look at the trust deed and rules and, if these are too muddled, ask the
pensions manager to provide a summary. It is also essential to understand
the main scheme booklet.'
The trust deed sets out, among other points, how the fund is to be invested
and the winding-up procedure. Robin Ellison, a partner with pensions
solicitor Ellison Westhorp, has written a guide for trustees*** which
includes an explanation of the key clauses to examine in deeds.
If the Goode proposals are taken up, trustees will be required to take
greater responsibility for checking a scheme's solvency and for distributing
any surplus funds on wind-up. Criminal sanctions may be imposed on trustees
and their professional advisers if they neglect their duty, so it is crucial
to be well briefed before signing up.

January 1994. Contact the NAPF on 071-730 0585.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Escape for employers - A pension
ruling by the European Court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEN AND women may have been created equal but their pensions have not.
Earlier this week, the European Court of Justice underscored its landmark
May 1990 ruling - known as Barber v. Guardian Royal Exchange - that pension
benefits for men and women had to be equal. But it also said that no
employer should be liable for equality before May 1990.
The case decided this week - known by the name of its plaintiff, Ten Oever -
asked if employers who paid survivors' pensions to widows must also do so
for widowers. The court said yes, but not for those employed before the
Barber judgement took effect.
The court, however, must still adjudicate on a number of other equally
vexing cases. One of the most complex and far-reaching has been brought by
pension scheme members at Coloroll, the UK home furnishings company now in
liquidation. In short, it asks just how far employers must go towards
providing equal pensions.
The tricky part of the question rests on the fact that women live longer
than men. Therefore, it costs more to support a woman to the end of her
natural life than it does for a man, even if both retire at the same age.
So, if an employer provides a female employee with a larger lump sum upon
retirement to buy an annuity to give her the same benefits as a male
employee, does that constitute an unequal pension benefit?
Indications from the advocate-general, who advises the court, are that the
answer is yes. But if the employer gives her the same sum as a man, and she
can buy only a lower monthly stream of payments, does that not also
constitute an unequal provision?
Part of the problem lies with the European insurance industry; as yet, its
actuaries have not devised what are known as 'unisex' actuarial tables.
These are rates which both men and women have to pay to achieve the same
stream of benefits, and have been common in the US for years.
The final Coloroll ruling is not expected until late this year or early in
1994.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DYSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST MONTH, we drew attention to the fact that direct holdings of bonds
provide investors with a fixed income, tax efficiency and, in many cases, a
known future value for their capital. Here, we offer examples of how this
diverse market can answer some less common requirements.
A tax-exempt investor wants a high gross income.
Eurosterling bonds pay interest gross to non-UK residents but tax will be
deducted from payments to UK residents. There are, however, a number of
domestic bonds that pay interest gross to all investors (such income should
be declared and could make you liable to income tax).
These bonds are from two sectors: namely, supernational bulldogs and housing
associations. Supernational bulldogs (domestic sterling bonds for non-UK
borrowers issued by multi-government agencies such as the World Bank), are a
useful option to gilts and should be compared with gilts bought through the
post office register. Alternatively, significantly higher yields than gilts
(albeit with higher risk) are possible by buying bonds from housing
associations.
For example, the Housing Finance Corporation 8.625 per cent 2023 at a price
of 101.25 offers yields of 8.25 per cent income and 8.51 per cent gross
redemption yield. These compare with the nearest comparable gilt at 7.51 per
cent income and 7.27 per cent GRY.
A tax-exempt investor wants to buy a bond that bears no income but increases
the capital significantly.
The tax treatment of zero coupon bonds is complicated and net investors
often concentrate instead on the zero dividend preference share market.
Consequently, zero coupon bonds are available at high gross yields.
One such bond is the Exeter Preferred Capital Zero Coupon Debenture 2002. It
is secured on a portfolio of split capital investment trusts, and investors
who buy bonds at 51.5 can look forward to repayment at 100 at January 31
2002 - a yield of 8.16 per cent.
Michael Dyson is director of Barclays de Zoete Wedd Capital Markets Ltd.
Please note that BZW Capital Markets is a market-maker and cannot deal with
private clients direct, so those interested in buying bonds should approach
a broker.

SINCE Capel Cure Myers launched its special situations fund in 1971, it has
had a variety of identities, although retaining the same basic philosophy.
Known first as Alben, then Vanguard, it now goes under the catchy name of
Capability Special Situations.
Kenneth Levy, the manager since 1977 and head of fund management at CCM,
sums up a special situations stock as one which could be expected to show
above-average capital appreciation. 'I try to buy winners and sell losers,'
he says. 'That sounds easy but, to do it, I look at the fundamentals of a
company. I'll buy if the profit upgrades are good and if there is a 'good
news' flow. If all that is in place and the shares are underperforming, I
usually won't buy because, seven times out of 10, the market knows more than
you.'
Levy is a believer in market momentum when the price of a share in which he
has invested is moving as well as, or better, than its sector. Adopting the
market momentum, by refraining from going against the market, is also
designed to protect the fund from losing money. 'If there are profit
downgrades, and a bad news flow, I'll cut my holding. That way, you don't
get caught in a Polly Peck.'
The strategy certainly seems to be working. The fund is top of the UK growth
sector in the 10 years to October 1. Over five years, it is 21st out of 118
and sixth out of 137 in the three years to October 1 (offer-to-bid with
income re-invested, according to Micropal).
Despite the strong performance, the fund, with Pounds 33m assets under
management, is relatively small. Levy says it has never been marketed
aggressively and has been used mainly as an in-house broker fund.
He explains that the skill of his job is 'as much about reducing poor
performance as it is about getting a particular stock right.' He is only too
aware that he is trying to protect investors' money as well as to make it
grow; thus, he is risk-averse in a recession by switching out of the medium
size and smaller companies, which make up the bulk of the fund in more
buoyant times, to the relative safety of blue chip companies.
Until a year ago, 70-80 per cent of the fund was invested in FT-SE 100
stocks, with cash holdings of up to 10 per cent and some gilts. 'As we've
been moving from recession to expansion, I've shifted the composition of the
fund so that it is now only 33 per cent invested in FT-SE 100 companies and
two-thirds in FT-SE 250 companies,' Levy says.
He has been selling or reducing holdings in Bowater, the packaging, printing
and coated products group; and Weir Group, the engineering company, after
profit downgrades. Instead, at a time when interest rates have been falling
and are expected to drop further, he has been building up holdings in those
stocks which are sensitive to interest rate movements. These include
financial and insurance company stocks.
The largest holdings are in General Electric, which accounts for about 3 per
cent of the fund; National Westminster bank; Provident Financial, the
consumer credit and insurance company; Smith New Court, the securities
house; and insurance companies such as General Accident, GRE, Royal
Insurance and Prudential.
His favourites among the medium size companies include James Halstead, the
floor-covering group which this week reported a doubling of pre-tax profits
in the year to June 30; Stagecoach, the Perth-based regional bus service
operator, and FKI, the electrical engineering group which demerged from
Babcock International and announced a large US acquisition last week. There
about 55 stocks altogether in the fund.
Surely the belief in market momentum should favour tracker funds, which aim
to follow the market, at the expense of managed funds? 'No,' says Levy,
'because if you apply the fundamentals, you'll get successful outperformance
over time since you are more likely than not to know those sectors which can
be pitfalls.
Charges. The initial charge is 5 per cent and the bid-offer spread is about
6 per cent. The annual management fee is 1 per cent and the minimum
investment is Pounds 500. There is a Pep attached to the fund at no extra
cost but there is no savings scheme at present, although this is under
review.

</HEADLINE>

BUSINESS expansion scheme investors do not lack for choice, writes
Scheherazade Daneshkhu. Recent issues include an arranged exit, cash-backed
scheme from sponsor Matrix Securities for Middlesex University, offering a
return of 122p after five years for every 100p invested. The equivalent
annual compounded return to a higher rate taxpayer investor in Aegis V is
14.27 per cent. Minimum subscription is Pounds 1,000.
Royal Bank of Scotland has issued BESSA RBS, sponsored by Close Brothers,
which gives investors a choice of a fixed exit price of 120p (equating to an
annual return of 13.8 per cent for higher rate taxpayers) or a FT-SE 100
linked return. The investor receives a minimum of 60p plus 2.5p for every 1
per cent rise in the index, up to a maximum of 36 per cent. There are
lock-ins at rises of 24 per cent and 36 per cent.
The scheme comes with top credit ratings and recommendations from both BESt
Investment and Best BES Advice. Minimum investment: Pounds 2,000.
Oxford Colleges BES, sponsored by Hodgson Martin, aims to raise Pounds 12m
for St Hugh's, St Peter's and Wadham colleges. It is offering an arranged
exit price of 118p, which the sponsors say equates to a compunded annual
return of up to 14.2 per cent. It is backed by gilts. Minimum investment:
Pounds 2,000.
Great Western II is an assured tenancy BES sponsored by Rowan Dartington, a
West Country stockbroker, and issued by Knightstone Housing Association,
which owns properties with a vacant possession value of about Pounds 220m.
The aim is to raise a minimum of Pounds 750,000 to provide low-rent homes.
The fixed exit price of 123p will be partially cash-backed with deposits at
Knightstone.
Govett BES Taxsaver, sponsored by John Govett is an extension of
Assetbuilder, number 4 of which was issued earlier this year, and has raised
Pounds 6m. It will develop properties in the Portland Basin area near
Manchester which will be bought back after five years by Sanctuary Housing
Association. There is some cash backing. The fixed exit price is 117p but
the sponsors say that, since BES3 certificates will be out by the end of
November, this equates to a compounded annual return of 13.9 per cent to a
higher rate taxpayer.
Sponsor Neill Clerk has also launched Unchained Reversions plc, to raise
Pounds 1.9m It is a home reversion BES under which elderly owners sell their
property in exchange for an assured tenancy in new accommodation. There is
no arranged exit. Minimum investment: Pounds 1,000.
Courtview BES Properties is an entrepreneurial scheme arranged by Peter
Duboff, a chartered accountant and chairman of Courtview BES companies. It
is not a sponsored issue and since no commission is payable to
intermediaries, costs should be kept low. The aim is to raise up to Pounds
10m to buy first-time buyer properties in London. A novel twist is a
dividend option of 5 per cent net a year.

<TEXT>
ANALYSTS are on Monday expecting annual pre-tax profits of about Pounds 40m
to Pounds 50m from Lucas Industries, the motor components and aerospace
group, compared with Pounds 22.5m last time. This year's total will be
flattered by about Pounds 12m of disposal profits. Trading continues to be
tough and some fear the dividend may be cut. The City will also be
interested in what the group has to say about its search for a chief
executive, which has become something of a soap opera.
Interim results to the end of August from Body Shop, the natural cosmetics
and toiletries retailer, are expected to show pre-tax profits of Pounds 9m
to Pounds 9.3m, against Pounds 8.3m last time. The UK is likely still to be
depressed compared with a relatively good first half last year. The US
contribution will be affected by currency translation, although stores in
the region are expected to have traded well.
Highland Distilleries is expected to report full-year pre-tax profits on
Monday of about Pounds 39m, including Pounds 10m from the change to equity
accounting of its 35 per cent stake in Robertson &amp; Baxter, the whisky
distiller. At the trading level, profits are likely to show a near-10 per
cent increase to Pounds 24m, with continuing benefits coming from Remy
Cointreau's distribution of Highland's Famous Grouse whisky.
On Tuesday St Ives, the UK's largest independent printer, is expected to
report full-year pre-tax profits of about Pounds 22m, slightly ahead of last
year's Pounds 21.1m. The results will be the first since Miles Emley took
over as chairman from Robert Gavron earlier this year.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: ICS set for reform - Changes to
investor protection plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INVESTORS' Compensation Scheme is the safety net underpinning the
Financial Services Act. It promises to compensate them for losses resulting
from regulatory breaches if no one else is available to pay.
The ICS has been particularly important for those who discover they have
been conned but that those responsible have gone out of business or
disappeared with the cash. Since its inception in August 1988, it has paid
out Pounds 36.2m to 4,477 investors.
It is funded (up to Pounds 48m) by a levy on members of each self-regulatory
organisation, with individual assessments usually based on the volume of
business conducted by each member. But heavy claims stemming particularly
from excesses by one sector of the industry - independent financial advisers
 -and the inability of regulators to secure insurance up to the desired
level of Pounds 100m, has forced a re-think of how the ICS is to be run.
Earlier this week, the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief
regulatory watchdog which oversees the ICS, prepared a discussion document
on the scheme's future.
This recommends several significant changes and asks for public comment by
November 19. SIB intends to put the revisions into effect by April.
The most significant change is to end what is known as 'cross-contribution.'
This means that if losses incurred by one group of members exceed their
contributions, then members of other self-regulating organisations must
contribute as well.
In each of the past three years, Fimbra members - who include the IFAs
responsible for the bulk of claims - have been bailed out by the life
insurance industry, which has volunteered to help pay for Fimbra's portion.
The life insurers rely on IFAs to help sell their products, and it could be
argued that they have good reason to help out. In the 1991/92 year, though,
members of other SROs also had to contribute towards the Fimbra shortfall.
SIB's preferred solution is that each SRO should have its own compensation
scheme, although it is possible that the schemes could be managed centrally
as a single unit to cut costs. Each scheme should have a 'cap' of Pounds
100m in claims, a level which has never as yet been approached.
Some firms, particularly banks and building societies which sell insurance
and pension products, do not belong to any of the SROs but have chosen to be
regulated directly by SIB. But it is trying to extricate itself from direct
regulation, and says in its paper that any firm it regulates will have to
pay the same contribution to the scheme as any other.
That appears to be a subtle way of encouraging banks and societies to join a
proposed new SRO for all retail financial services firms, to be known as the
Personal Investment Authority. Some banks and societies have baulked,
however, saying they do not wish to have to pay for the antics of some
less-responsible Fimbra members.
Meanwhile, SIB proposes that if the schemes are to be managed separately, it
will link the contribution each SRO makes to management costs to the number
of times claims are made by their members. Thus, SROs with members making
the fewest claims will bear the lowest management costs.
Those wishing to comment on the proposals may write to: The Securities and
Investments Board, Gavrelle House, 2-14 Bunhill Row, London EC1Y 8RA.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Health insurance that won't bleed
you dry / A look at the options for budget-price treatment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COST of private medical insurance has been rising by well above the rate
of inflation. This, combined with the recession, has led to a wave of policy
cancellations. So, insurers have been fighting back with new budget policies
designed to cover the basics.
Fear of long NHS waiting lists is the main reason many people think of
buying private cover. While the government's much-trumpeted campaign to cut
waiting lists might have reduced your chances of having to wait two years
for a routine operation, many people are still waiting a year or more, often
in considerable discomfort, for non-urgent procedures such as hip
replacements or hernia repairs.
One of the commonest devices used to lower the cost of private medical
insurance is the six-week rule. This means that once a consultant has said
you need to go to hospital, you use the NHS if it has a waiting list of less
than six weeks for that operation. But if the wait would be longer than six
weeks, you get private treatment immediately.
The six-week rule is, however, one of the most misunderstood concepts in
insurance. Many people believe it means they must wait six weeks for private
treatment. The important thing to understand is that it means you should
never have to wait more than six weeks for treatment, whether in the NHS or
privately.
You must remember, though, that signing up for private cover is not going to
help you jump the queue if you already have a problem which needs treatment.
Medical cover is the same as any other insurance: it is intended to pay out
if the unexpected happens, not for certainties.
If you have a medical problem already, most insurers will accept you for
cover but will exclude treatment for that condition, or anything related to
it, either permanently or for at least two years. This provides a powerful
incentive to join a medical insurance scheme while you are young and
healthy, and to stick with the same insurer.
Apart from the six-week rule, the other main cost-cutting methods behind
budget policies are annual cash limits, the exclusion of most outpatient
treatment, and a limited choice of hospitals. Some schemes include all these
elements, which can make them difficult to understand.
Jan Lawson, of specialist intermediary Private Health Partnership,
emphasises the importance of understanding exactly how a scheme works, and
what is covered, when you join so as to avoid disappointment later. Both
Lawson and Irene Gallimore of Medisure, another specialist broker, pick the
Norwich Union Personal Care scheme as a budget policy worth considering.
This policy is very basic, in that it excludes virtually all consultations
and treatment as an out-patient. But it does not impose any cash limits on
in-patient treatment and there is no waiting period.
Gallimore also likes Norwich's Express Care Six, which is a comprehensive
policy with a six-week rule.
Unlike some six-week policies, it pays for consultations before it is clear
whether you need private hospital treatment. But Lawson generally is wary of
six-week rule policies because so many people find them confusing.
Exclusions
Most insurers have a similar list of basic exclusions, such as chronic or
terminal illnesses (such as kidney failure and Aids), self-inflicted
conditions (eg, alcohol-related), voluntary procedures (vasectomy,
infertility treatment) and run-of-the-mill expenses such as dentistry and
spectacles.
Other exclusions can vary between insurers and policies. Gallimore says two
to watch for are psychiatric care and pregnancy complications.
Mental illness is surprisingly common and has a wide definition. If, for
example, your teenage daughter developed the slimmers' disease, anorexia, a
psychiatric exclusion would come into effect.
Healthy pregnancy is excluded by all but a handful of policies but
complications are covered by some, often with the proviso that 10 months
must have elapsed since the policy started.
As Gallimore points out: 'You don't get pregnancy waiting lists in the NHS'
 -but it can be reassuring to know that, if there are complications, you can
opt for private care.
Choice of hospitals
Hospital accommodation is usually graded A, B or C, according to the
standard of the private rooms (not the quality of medical care). Some
private hospitals have only grade A accommodation, while others offer a
range.
Hospital charges for ancillary services also vary, so some policies use only
hospitals with lower charges.
Some budget policies are restricted to basic accommodation, while others
offer a choice. A few insurers go by post code, as hospitals in London and
other cities tend to be in the upper price bracket.
A 45-year-old in central London would, for example, pay Pounds 43.73 a month
for a Norwich Union Expresscare Six policy, compared with Pounds 19.97 for
someone living in a cheaper area.
If your post code is highly rated, you could opt for a policy with a choice
of grades, or with uniform rates for the whole country.
WPA and Norwich both have policies which use only private beds in NHS
hospitals. Another Norwich scheme, Local Care, makes you choose in advance
the one hospital where you could receive treatment - but offers you a list
of about 43 around the country.
Other discounts
One tip from Gallimore is to check if your employer, or any other group or
organisation of which you are a member, has a group scheme which could give
you a discount. Even holders of some credit cards are eligible for
discounts. If you have no ready-made group, you could try persuading
colleagues, friends or relatives to form one.
Several insurers offer no-claims discounts. For each year you do not make a
claim, your premium is reduced by a set percentage. This discourages people
from making small claims, which push up administration costs.
Lawson thinks no-claims discounts are a good idea but cautions that you
should first check what the standard premium is: some insurers offer
'introductory discounts' of up to 30 per cent which means that, if you claim
in the first year, you could find your premiums shooting up by that amount.
A more predictable way of securing a discount is by agreeing to pay an
excess - a fixed amount towards every claim. Again, this is intended to
discourage small claims. Bupa has discounts for fixed excesses of Pounds
100-Pounds 250 while Ohra, a Dutch insurer, has a system which gives
discounts of up to 37.5 per cent if you agree to pay up to 50 per cent of
the standard annual premium.
For a 45-year-old with a Medios policy using Band C accommodation, agreeing
to a 50 per cent excess (Pounds 142.50) would cut premiums from Pounds 25.00
to Pounds 15.63 a month. With a 30 per cent excess (Pounds 116.28), premiums
would be Pounds 20.63.
Some insurers, such as the Norwich Union, give discounts for paying annually
rather than monthly.
How to buy
Medical insurance is often sold through direct marketing - a leaflet is sent
with your bank or credit card statement, or falls out of a magazine. The
problem here is knowing how what you are being offered compares with other
cover available.
Lawson recommends comparing policy terms between a comprehensive policy and
a budget one, so you can see exactly what is left out.
'The worst culprits are when some of the cheaper policies are being sold by
direct mail,' she says. 'They are marketed as if they were full schemes.'
If you are confused by the hundreds of subtly different schemes on the
market, you could ask an independent financial adviser for help, or approach
one of the specialist medical insurance brokers.
Medisure operates a telephone advice line* which can help to narrow down
which policies, from the vast range on the market, are most likely to meet
your needs.
Private Health Partnership, charges a Pounds 10 initial fee for an
information pack and detailed questionnaire, based on which it recommends
one or two suitable plans. It is then up to you whether you buy the policy
and, if so, whether you buy it through PHP. Both Medisure and PHP earn
commission on policies bought through them.
If you buy through an independent intermediary, most offer a back-up service
to help you when you make a claim, or if you have any problems with the
company.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Markets: A standing ovation for the equity market - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, financial editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservative party is the party of sound money or it is nothing. Kenneth
Clarke October 7 1993
IF YOU take those words at face value, there was an important message for
the markets in Kenneth Clarke's big set-piece speech to the Conservative
conference.
Yet both the equity and gilts markets were unmoved. Shares closed on
Thursday a little below their levels of the day before. And the yield on
20-year gilts, the best indicator of the anticipated soundness of money,
edged up a fraction.
Does this lacklustre reaction mean that the markets had already fully
discounted what Clarke had to say? Or simply that they do not take
politicians' words at face value?
A bit of both, perhaps. Still, the speech is worth examining, because it
captures neatly the the policy uncertainties the market must deal with.
First, the quotation reprinted at the head of this article. Let us take it
as an earnest of good intentions rather than as a strictly accurate
portrayal of the historical record - Conservative chancellors have, after
all, been responsible for two of the three big bursts of inflation of the
past two decades. Suppose that it means Clarke is fully committed to a
low-inflation policy, perhaps influenced by the 1 1/2 -2 per cent target
proposed by Rupert Pennant-Rea, the new deputy governor of the Bank of
England.
If that is what the government intends, as the basis for its November budget
and its monetary policy decisions, then some, at least, of the stock market
commentators will be wrong-footed. Take the latest thoughts from Robert
Buckland and Bob Semple of NatWest Securities. 'Absolutely key to our whole
equity market valuation,' they say, 'is our expectation that inflation has
now bottomed out.' Gilts will do poorly as a result, they argue, and
equities look more attractive, as the underlying rate of inflation edges up
towards 4 per cent.
True, they do not expect it to break this ceiling, the upper limit of the
government's current official target range. But steady 4 per cent inflation
would halve the value of your money in 18 1/2 years, less than the average
life of a mortgage or the time the typical woman spends on a pension. That
is not what most people understand by 'sound money'.
So, if the chancellor's commitment to sound money is more than rhetoric, it
implies greater stringency than the current outlook for inflation would
suggest. A monetary policy based on truly low inflation would give some
investors, at least, a bit of a surprise. It would make gilts relatively
more attractive than equities; it would dash hopes of a further cut in
interest rates; and it would imply an economic policy tight enough to
undermine the expectations of an earnings recovery on which current share
values are based.
The market clearly read none of this into the speech. As the week ended, the
FT-SE 100 index, having edged past its all-time closing high on Wednesday,
had lost none of its sparkle. It finished the week at 3108.6, a new record.
In one sense, the FT-SE 100 was not alone: other bourses round the world,
from Australia to Switzerland, were setting new highs this week also. In
another sense, however, the UK's blue-chip index was moving upwards
unaccompanied: the two indices which reflect the performance of mid-sized
and smaller UK stocks were noticeably hanging back. The FT-SE Mid 250 index,
which closed the week at 3477.3, is still below its August high of 3513.3;
the FT-SE SmallCap is also below its peak.
The two factors were perhaps connected. A wave of worldwide equity buying,
by big continental and US institutions, has been pushing up share indices
around the world. These investors tend to be interested in the top stocks,
not the smaller fry. In many cases, they buy into the index future, leaving
market arbitrage to drag up the individual constituents. This week, for
example, the FT-SE 100 future has been consistently leading the cash market
higher, trading about 10 points above the 'fair value' calculation that
reflects the interest implications of a forward contract.
Still, volumes in both futures and cash market have been unremarkable: the
week has lacked the true buying frenzy which takes the market well into
fresh territory.
There were few noteworthy developments in individual stocks. One that stood
out was the announcement that Whitbread was giving equal voting rights to
its two classes of shareholders; and also buying out the 50.1 per cent of
publicly owned shares in its sibling, the Whitbread Investment Company,
which has long extended an umbrella over small independent brewers. The
market had obviously expected at least one of these developments:
Whitbread's B shares, which have 20 times the voting power of the A shares,
were among the best performing shares in the world last month, according to
the FT-Actuaries World Indices. As compensation for losing their superior
voting rights, B shareholders will get 1.27 new A shares for every B share
they own.
There was less happy news for shareholders in Tiphook, the heavily indebted
container leasing and transport rental group. On Thursday, its shares fell
nearly 30 per cent after the company warned it would breach its banking
covenants. They closed the week at 123p, half the 253p they fetched a week
ago and a quarter of their May 1992 level. Yesterday, it looked as if Robert
Montague, Tiphook's founder and executive chairman, might pay the price of
dashing shareholders' and bankers' expectations.
The key to survival, perhaps, is to set the financial markets' expectations
so low that there is no danger of missing them. Kenneth Clarke is clearly
set for a long and happy career.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Markets: Life after Taurus for shareholders - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER the Taurus fiasco in March, when the stock exchange abandoned its
plans for a computerised trading system, the Bank of England set up a task
force to produce new proposals.
It suggested a 10-day rolling system to replace the present two-week
account, with the aim of reducing the settlement period further to five
days. A new electronic system, known as Crest, would be set up eventually to
allow 'paperless' trading so that share certificates and stock transfer
forms would not need to be passed between broker and client.
The exchange, which has kept a low profile after the Taurus embarrassment,
announced this week that it would adapt its existing Talisman settlements
system to the 10-day rolling period from July 18 next year.
What will the change mean for private shareholders? At the moment, they have
two weeks - sometimes longer - to settle accounts. They are also able to pay
only the net amount at the end of the account. If, for example, you were to
buy shares today for Pounds 500 and sell others in a few days for Pounds
400, you would only have to pay out Pounds 100 (excluding costs) at the end
of the account period. Under the rolling system, if you were to buy the
shares today you would have to pay out Pounds 500 10 days after the day you
bought them.
There is also an effect on the delivery of shares. If you sell shares and
buy them back during an account period, you do not have to deliver them. But
with a rolling settlement system, you would have to deliver the shares.
The effect of this on 'bed-and-breakfasting' shares for capital gains tax
purposes, is not yet clear. John Cobb, a member of the Bank of England task
force and chairman of the Association of Private Client Investment Managers
and Stockbrokers, says that since the system has the flexibility of allowing
for different settlement dates, it should be possible to co-ordinate sale
and repurchase of shares for settlement on one day. Whether the Inland
Revenue will view this with favour is another matter.
Many argue that rolling settlement will be more efficient and less risky
than the present system. London's two-week settlement period is far longer
than that of other main markets and regulators have been concerned that if
either buyer or seller fails to deliver, other market participants with
unsettled trades could face large losses.
Those who are selling will benefit from rolling settlement most since they
will receive their money more quickly than at present.
What is more problematic is the envisaged move towards five-day rolling
settlement. This will not give enough time for a shareholder to get his
contract note from the broker, send him a cheque and have the cheque
cleared.
This system only becomes workable if private investors place their stock in
the nominee name of their broker or have a deposit account with him. At the
moment it appears that brokers will need to use a pooled nominee.
However, many shareholders dislike the pooled nominee system because they
are deprived of many of their rights.
Unlike a designated nominee account, where the shares are registered jointly
in the name of the nominee company and the shareholder, in a pooled nominee,
the stock is not registered in the shareholder's name. He does not receive
direct communication from the company and so forgoes the company's annual
report and meeting and direct information on rights issues.
Most brokers charge the shareholder a fee for being in a nominee and they
will also charge for handling a cash account.
Fortunately, investors will not be obliged to go down this route (unlike
Taurus, where they were not given the choice) but they will end up paying
more for the privilege of eschewing paperless transactions.
It would be welcome if the Bank of England could implement measures by which
private shareholders would be able to retain their shareholder rights while
benefitting from the lower costs and greater efficiency which the new system
is said to introduce. Preserving and refining the designated nominee system
is one suggestion.
Otherwise there will be considerable, and understandable, private
shareholder resistence to the new system.
The rebuke to North of England building society this week by the Securities
and Investments Board, the chief regulator for the financial services
industry, is yet another reminder of how poorly regulated the industry is.
The building society's independent financial advisers encouraged employees
to leave company pension schemes and buy personal pensions. They sold
with-profits bonds to people who did not understand the surrender penalties.
Although most banks and building societies are regulated by the SIB, this is
only the first time that it has publicly criticised a company which it
regulates. Unlike the self-regulating organisations, it does not have the
power to impose a fine although North of England says it will pay
compensation to those involved.
If the proposed self-regulating body, the Personal Investment Authority, is
to be credible, it should at least ensure that all those in financial
services operate under the same regime.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Markets: Investors eye Somalia and think of Vietnam - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADITIONALLY parochial in their outlook, US investors are learning to pay
more attention to what happens outside their borders. This week, for
example, the political crisis in Russia grabbed the attention of New York's
financial markets. On Tuesday morning, President Yeltsin's apparent triumph
over his enemies helped lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average by more than
20 points.
Also this week, the markets were keeping a close eye on the deteriorating
situation in Somalia where 12 US troops were killed and at least one US
aviator captured and paraded in front of the world's press.
At first glance, there seemed no direct link between events in Somalia and
the New York markets - the US has no pressing economic or strategic
interests in the Horn of Africa. Yet, any hint that US forces might become
entangled in a protracted, and probably unwinnable, overseas military
conflict unnerves Wall Street because of the potentially high financial and
political costs.
For many Americans, the sights and sounds emanating from Mogadishu revived
unhappy memories of Vietnam. Economists worry that the country's confidence,
already shaken by a protracted period of economic stagnation and growing
social problems, would be further undermined by a messy involvement in
another foreign conflict far from home.
On a more positive international note, US markets took heart this week from
buoyant stock prices in Europe, where hopes for fresh interest rate cuts and
a resurgence in local economies boosted demand for equities in Frankfurt,
Paris and London.
While Wall Street generally regards gains in overseas stocks as positive for
domestic markets, there is a danger that the strong performance of foreign
equities could lure funds out of US stocks. Recent figures on mutual fund
sales have shown that US investors' appetite for funds that invest in
foreign markets has been growing steadily this year.
Finally, evidence of how international US markets have become was there for
everyone to see on Wall Street this week. Well, not actually on Wall Street
but on neighbouring Broad Street where a variety of of cars, trucks,
helicopters and model aircraft made by Daimler-Benz were on display on
Tuesday to celebrate the launch of the German group's shares on the New York
Stock Exchange.
Daimler became the first German company to obtain a full listing for its
stock on a US exchange, and more are expected to follow now that the
country's biggest industrial group has bitten the bullet and agreed to
calculate its earnings according to US accounting principles.
Domestic investors are searching overseas for investment opportunities
primarily because the markets at home are looking increasingly overpriced.
It is difficult to justify share prices at, or near to, record highs when
the economic fundamentals remain so unimpressive.
Take yesterday's September employment numbers. Although non-farm payrolls
last month rose by a seemingly-solid 156,000, the headline number disguised
underlying weakness in the manufacturing sector, where payrolls actually
shrank last month. There was also a worrying decline in the number of
work-hours.
The weakness in manufacturing jobs explained why the stock markets ignored
yesterday's rally in bond prices. The 30-year bond shot up by more than a
point after the employment report, lowering the yield to 5.917 per cent, but
equities fell.
Investors are also concerned about corporate earnings. The third-quarter
reporting season opens in earnest next week and, over the past few days,
several big companies - notably Advanced Micro Devices and Corning - issued
warnings that their latest three-monthly results would fall short of market
expectations. Although there were other companies, such as Chemical Banking
and Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber, predicting strong improvements in profits this
week, investors preferred to dwell longer on the negative news.
The weakness of market sentiment has prevented prices from gaining much of a
lift from the recent rash of mergers and acquisitions. Two more sizeable
deals were announced this week. In the banking sector, the regional banks
KeyCorp and Society Corp unveiled plans to join forces while, in the
healthcare sector, HCA-Hospital Corporation of America agreed to be acquired
by Columbia Healthcare.
Both transactions were measured in billions of dollars, and are proof of a
remarkable recovery in the domestic M&amp;A business. The latest figures show
that M&amp;A activity, measured in numbers of transactions, is stronger than it
has ever been.
Monday     3577.76 - 03.35

Wednesday  3598.99 + 11.73

FT  09 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Halifax house index climbs - At a
glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE prices in September were 1 per cent higher than in September 1992,
according to the Halifax building society. This is the first annual rise in
the seasonally adjusted Halifax house price index since January 1991. The
annual rise could reach 2 or 3 per cent by the end of this year, the society
said, but warned that the housing market recovery was still fragile.
In contrast, the Nationwide building society's index showed a year-on-year
fall of 2.5 per cent in September. This was largely due to a drop of 1.8 per
cent since August, the first fall in the Nationwide index for five months.
However, the Nationwide also predicts a modest year-on-year gain by the end
of 1993.

surge was thought to be German investment funds moving out of bonds and
money market funds and into equities, as capital market rates fall.
Equities currently form a historically low proportion of privately-held
German funds' portfolios, so there is scope for a continued boost to the
market. Foreign investors, particularly from the US, have also been showing
interest in German shares due to hopes of growth in corporate earnings after
restructuring.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Markets: Whitbread's guessing game - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHITBREAD'S restructuring this week has stirred investor interest in the
regional brewers and pub companies.
With the takeover of its associated Whitbread Investment Company (WIC), the
national brewer will acquire stakes in a dozen of the regionals. The
question is: what will it do with them?
All Whitbread has said so far is that it will 'undertake a thorough and
careful review of the options for the investments' in consultation with the
companies. Those options include selling the investments to raise cash,
retaining some of them to underpin trading links, or using them in some
cases to launch a full takeover bid.
Decisions will have to be made on the stakes in Boddington, the
Cheshire-based pub retailer, and Marston, Thompson &amp; Evershed, the
Burton-on-Trent brewer, within six months of the WIC acquisition. Whitbread
will hold about 21 per cent of the shares in each of these groups and, to
comply with the government's beer orders, will have to reduce the holdings
to less than 15 per cent or free several hundred more of its own pubs from
exclusive beer supplies.
Second-guessing Whitbread's intentions has already lifted the shares in the
past two days: Boddington by 8p to 268p, and Marston by 14p to 280p.
Each could have acquisition attractions for Whitbread after the
disappointment of losing Grand Metropolitan's Chef &amp; Brewer pubs to Scottish
&amp; Newcastle. Boddington, which sold its breweries and eponymous beer brand
to Whitbread when it quit brewing in 1989, has nearly 500 pubs as well as
leisure hotels. Marston has nearly 900 pubs and Whitbread already
distributes its Pedigree bitter, one of the strongest regional beer brands.
Their regional strengths, Boddington in the north-west and Marston in the
midlands, would complement Whitbread's position in southern England. If it
decides to use its greater freedom to make acquisitions in the pub sector -
braving the inevitable interest of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission -
there are few better packages available.
Whitbread's stakes in the other regionals would seem to have less intrinsic
interest for the group apart, in some instances, from helping to smooth the
supply of its beers into their pubs. But their disposal could enliven the
sector.
If the 12 per cent stake in Morland comes on to the market, it could
re-awaken the interest of Greene King, which is sitting on 29.3 per cent of
the Thames Valley brewer after its unsuccessful bid last year. And
Brakspear, the Oxfordshire brewer, the controlling family of which bought a
chunk of its shares from WIC last year, now faces the disposal of a second
tranche.
With the potential sale of more than Pounds 100m of shares in regionals from
Vaux (Pounds 22.5m) and Greenalls (Pounds 12.7m) in the north, to
Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley (Pounds 6.4m) in the midlands and Fuller, Smith &amp;
Turner (Pounds 5.9m) in the south, the sector will come under keen scrutiny.
It will reveal some promising changes since the MMC shake-up of the industry
 -not least, a strategic return to the core business of brewing and pubs
after some wild excursions into such activities as computers and
carpet-cleaning.
The regionals, in general, have made good use of the opportunities afforded
by the MMC to strengthen their pub estates and, with the renaissance of
cask-conditioned ales, their beer brands. 'They have provided shareholders
with an impressive rate of growth over the past four years,' says Michelle
Proud, analyst at NatWest Securities.
'The average rate of compound growth in earnings during this period has been
9 per cent - significantly better than that of either the market or of the
major brewers.
'No fund manager is likely to have lost sleep with investments in the
regional brewers.'
So far, pub retailers have done better than the integrated brewers, but the
balance could be changing as the recession recedes.
Those companies which remained in brewing, have strong ale brands and an
expandable, well-run, managed pub estate can now expect higher rates of
growth.

FT  09 OCT 93 / The Long View: Negative equity trap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOSE waggish building society statisticians are teasing us once again:
Halifax told us this week that house prices rose in September and are up 1
per cent year-on-year, while Nationwide claimed they fell and are still
running 2.5 per cent lower than in September last year.
The difference of view might reflect the fragmentation of the housing market
as well as the low volume of transactions and the building societies' loss
of mortgage market share, which make the figures more erratic. Nationwide
claims that the average house price is Pounds 53,000, while the Halifax says
Pounds 63,000. You could read into that obvious difference in sample
structure that the more expensive end of the market is now doing rather
better, which fits in with local gossip down my own street.
This year's lower interest rates, and the prospect of a further fall to
come, have improved the tone of the market, and the stabilisation of the
unemployment numbers has helped as well. On the other hand, it is possible
that the revenue-starved Kenneth Clarke will further nibble away at tax
relief on mortgage interest in his first Budget next month. The long view of
the British housing market, moreover, is that time may be running out for
the generation that regarded a home as a prime money-making asset: the
demographic crisis of the late 1990s and early 2000s, in the shape of a
shortage of first-time buyers, looms ever closer.
Whatever the minor quirks of the indices, the general picture is that house
prices have stabilised and are now - nationally speaking - at reasonable
levels. The ratio of the average house price to average earnings is squarely
within the range of 3 to 3.5, which can be regarded as normal (compared with
almost 5 at the national price peak in 1989).
In terms of structure, however, the market cannot be said to have yet been
normalised, at any rate in the south. There, the negative equity problem
persists almost untouched. Perhaps 1.5m home owners - estimates range up to
nearly 2m - owe more to banks and building societies than their home is
worth. Such people, most of whom are first or second-time buyers dating from
1987 to 1990, are stuck in the same, probably inadequate, accommodation
after five or six years, and they could continue to be trapped for at least
as long into the future. They are certainly not going to be bailed out by
earnings inflation, which has been the key long-term energiser of house
prices in the past: it is running at only 3.5 per cent, and is unlikely to
accelerate in the near future.
True, it is possible to argue - as does John Wriglesworth, housing analyst
at UBS - that the problem will generate its own solution: because of the
shortage of available property in the affected regions prices there will be
forced up, perhaps by 20 per cent before a demand-supply balance will be
restored. I find it hard to believe this, however, because these are now
some of the British economy's most sluggish regions, precisely because of
the loss of the injection of demand previously provided in the 1980s by a
buoyant housing market, with all the attendant release of equity and
confidence-boosting wealth effect. Instead of an excess share of movers and
shakers Greater London now has a higher unemployment rate than Scotland or
Wales. Why would anybody pay a premium price to live in a depressed region?
It was because of my fears about a continuing freeze-up in the housing
market that a year ago I suggested the launching of a lifeboat, a national
household mortgage workout scheme to take over the troubled debt. This could
at least have lubricated the market (recently transactions have only been
running at half the rate of 2.15m recorded in 1988) and released young
people from imprisonment in starter homes, although they would still have
Pounds 10bn or more of residual debt hanging over them indefinitely.
In the circumstances any recovery in the housing market could now prove
patchy and distorted. Yet the upper end of the market, where the mortgage
problem scarcely applies, could respond to economic growth and the ready
availability of reasonably cheap loans. In the north and Scotland, too,
there is scope for business as usual: prices in Scotland are now a fifth
higher than in 1989.
The trouble is, people are less willing than they were to take on huge
debts. On average, a house purchase requires a 75 per cent advance, worth
approaching Pounds 50,000. Since 1989 the total of mortgage debt has gone up
from Pounds 250bn to Pounds 350bn, and it surely cannot rise very far in the
future. We may have entered a period of low interest rates but the personal
sector is much more indebted than it was before the previous house price
booms in the early 1970s and the late 1980s. And it may well be that 250,000
repossessions in the past five years have left their mark on attitudes in
Acacia Avenue.
So although I would expect house prices to rise over the next year, I would
be surprised if the average increase were more than 5 per cent. Looking
further ahead, moreover, there is the problem of the baby slumpers. The
number of 17-year-olds is about 30 per cent less than the population of
25-year-olds who are now entering their prime first-home buying years. In
the immediate future first-time demand should remain fairly healthy because
it is likely to be supplemented by buyers who have been waiting for the
market to stabilise. Last year's 400,000 first-time purchases compared with
the potential 'normal' figure of perhaps 550,000, so there is pent-up demand
out there. Between 1995 and 2000, however, the adverse demographic trend
will become noticeable.
Come the new millennium, I suspect, the rival building society house price
indices will no longer be divergent but will be telling much the same dreary
story.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Japan adapts its winning strategy to soccer: Companies such
as Nissan, Mitsubishi and Sony have turned their attention to packaging the
world's favourite sport. Charles Leadbeater, accustomed to the terraces of
English grounds, goes to a J-League match and gets a surprise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE MASSED bank of Yomiuri Verdy fans were in full voice, waving a host of
green flags, urging on their team against their bitter rivals, the Nissan
Marinos. But as they chanted - 'Verdy, Verdy' - one of the oddities of
Japanese soccer became fully apparent. It was not simply that their chant
had a pleading, rather than a threatening, tone - it was also a question of
pitch. They sounded like rejects for the Vienna boys choir. Most of the
Yomiuri Verdy fans were teenage girls.
In only six months, a craze for soccer has reached epidemic proportions in
Japan. A year ago, hardly anyone watched the game. Now, it is threatening to
dislodge Japan's stodgy baseball as the nation's most popular sport.
Most matches are sold out. People have moved house to be within the
catchment area for season tickets and - most alarming for Japanese men  -
young housewives are reported to have become so fascinated with its
fast-moving skills that they have stopped clearing up after evening meals
until half-time.
Amid the worst Japanese recession for 20 years, the launch of the J-League
this year has created from scratch a consumer market worth perhaps Y140bn.
(Pounds 87m) Soccer players have become part of the regular diet of Japan's
popular weekly magazines.
The rise of the 10-team J-League has been a telling demonstration of how the
Japanese industrial strategies, which took it to world leadership in cars
and electronics, can be applied to sports.
The J-League is a case study in how a sport can be turned into a big
business, through a partnership between the public and private sectors that
combines entrepreneurialism and central planning.
Even if Japan falls short of its ultimate goal - to become a force in the
world's most popular sport - the success of soccer has turned on their head
long held European assumptions about the game, as well as confirming one
central truth.
The truth is that the most important ingredient in professional soccer is
not the players, not what happens on the pitch, but the crowd. Japan has
cheerfully overturned the British assumption that soccer is an outlet for
men to indulge anything from harmless obsessions and boyish fantasies to
violent rages and racial prejudices.
In Japan soccer matches are not tribal contests but entertainment. And most
of the excitement does not come from events on the pitch - the quality of
the soccer is often mediocre - but the atmosphere generated by the dancing,
screaming, flag waving, horn hooting crowd.
The carnival atmosphere is no accident as Hisao Kinoshita, the executive at
advertising agency Hakuhodo responsible for soccer, explained: 'We set out
to make a soccer game like a disco, lots of vivid colour, lights, fashion,
music.'
The disco atmosphere has not detracted from the game. On the contrary it has
been a huge motivation according to Gary Lineker, the former England star
playing for Nagoya Grampus 8: 'The crowd is the best thing about the game.
Wherever we play the games are sold out and the crowd is not at all cynical.
They view the whole thing as positive, even if you are three nil down they
still get behind you and to be honest I have found that really refreshing.'
Lineker admits that at the end of his career with London's Tottenham
Hotspur, a top English team, his motivation for league games was flagging. A
few months playing in Japan has revived his spirits.
For anyone who has trodden fearfully through the turnstiles at a British
ground, endured 90 minutes of boredom and escaped relieved to be in one
piece, a trip to a Japanese soccer game would be a revelation.
At the Verdy-Marinos game, the 60,000 crowd was mainly young and mixed:
about 40 per cent of J-League spectators are women. They create a wall of
noise and colour even when the only entertainment is the Marino's dancing
mascot, an escapee from Disneyland - a giant chicken dressed as a sailor
captain.
The start of the game is announced by a booming American presenter and a
giant video screen, which replays the most exciting moments. At half time
people queue politely for the toilets and refreshments. At the end the crowd
files out in good humour, without dropping much rubbish, let alone hinting
at violence. In England many clubs have proudly launched 'family enclosures'
to attract parents and their young children. In Japan the entire stadium is
a family enclosure.
The game's popularity, especially among young people, is in large part a
reflection of the paucity of choices available to them. Baseball is a sport
mainly for men over the age of 30. Sumo is popular but tournaments are
months apart and tickets are expensive.
Soccer on the other hand allows young people to get out of their cramped
family homes and do things that are difficult in Japan: shout at the top of
your voice and display emotion in public.
The players provide unfamiliar and attractive role models. In Japanese
companies people are promoted according to their seniority; in soccer it is
performance that counts. The Japanese respect authority, especially when it
comes in uniforms; soccer players publicly dissent from it by shouting at
the referee. Sumo and baseball both promote a monosyllabic stoicism among
their stars, success is underplayed and defeat suffered as humiliation.
Soccer players are outspoken and revel in the publicity their love affairs
and garish clothes attract.
So the popularity of soccer is one more bit of evidence of the change of
social values under way in Japan. Baseball symbolises the values of
collective discipline that helped Japan to succeed after the second world
war. Soccer represents new values, as Kinoshita explained: 'We asked young
girls what soccer meant to them: they said it meant freedom. Baseball
players can only play baseball and within the game they have specific tasks
 -pitching, first base - which they have to stick to. Soccer players can run
all over the field and off the field they are treated like film stars.'
However, the J-League's success is also due to a well-planned strategy,
which combines several elements familiar in Japan's rise in other business
fields.
At the outset there was an entrepreneur with a vision: Saburo Kawabuchi, a
former player in the Japanese national team who persevered with his idea for
the league when many, including Dentsu, the country's largest advertising
agency, told him it would fail.
Kawabuchi has done for soccer what the likes of Akio Morita of Sony did for
electronics. He provided it with high ambition. He says: 'We thought that
unless we aimed for a high ideal it would not be worth it. If we had
attempted to achieve our goals in a gradual way it would have been natural
but I do not think it would have worked.'
The next step was to promote carefully planned co-operation in the name of
competition. The companies that owned the 10 amateur teams increased their
commitment. Toyota backs Nagoya Grampus 8; Mitsubishi the Red Diamonds,
while Verdy is backed by Yomiuri, the publishing group.
Most teams needed a cash injection of about Dollars 20m to improve their
stadiums and to set up reserve and youth teams.
But the league also insisted upon local involvement, to create a public
private partnership. Kinoshita explained: 'We wanted it to be a citizens'
game. Not focused on Tokyo but based in the regions.' So at Kashima, 45
miles north of Tokyo, home of the Antlers, winners of the league's first
stage, the local council brought together about 20 companies, led by
Sumitomo Metals, to back the team. Private money is being used to upgrade
public facilities.
Another vital ingredient, which played a central role in earlier Japanese
successes, is an unashamed borrowing of foreign technology.
The on-field technology has come in the form of balding, greying, injury
prone and aging stars such as Lineker, Pierre Littbarksi from Germany and a
clutch of Brazilians led by the legendary Zico. Alcindo, the Brazilian who
is the league's main goalscorer, has become a national hero.
But most important, the Japanese went to the US for the commercial
technology off the field. The J-League is following the American National
Football League, which controls the design, marketing and sales of items
related to its member teams. All J-League teams have songs and mascots,
emblems and a package of goods - caps, bags, waterproofs - in a homogenous
style designed by Sony Creative Products and pitched at 15-25 year olds.
Sony has opened 105 shops to sell the merchandise and Mizuno, the sportswear
maker, has opened a further 627 mini-boutiques to sell outfits.
Soccer has provided companies with a new route into the youth consumer
market, while the companies have provided soccer with the chance of long
term success.
The J-League's corporate backing means it will probably avoid the fate of
the North American Soccer League, which signed stars like Pele and Franz
Beckenbauer but eventually collapsed.
For the J-League to endure the standards of play will need to improve, to
match world standards. That will require further investment in foreign
expertise while Japanese production gets up to international standards. Yet
even so the Japanese national team is still in with a good chance of
qualifying for the 1994 World Cup.
Japan also needs investment in better grounds. Some, such as the national
stadium in Tokyo, are larger than anything in the UK premier league. Most
are small, former athletic tracks, where most of the crowd stand. By 1996
work must start on 12 stadiums with a capacity of more than 40,000 if Japan
is to host the 2002 World Cup. Lineker for one expects that year's World Cup
final will be played in Tokyo.
The patient long-termism of Japanese companies will be crucial. With the
heavy investment involved, it will take at least five years for the 120
companies backing the league to start making a profit.
Less certain is the commitment of Japan's new-found fans, the game's main
asset. The risk is that the younger sisters of all the teenage girls going
wild about Verdy will in years to come desert soccer for other crazes.
The J-League's organisers claim to have age on their side. The Ministry of
Education has been promoting soccer in elementary schools for 20 years so
most young Japanese - male and female - have played soccer at some point in
their youth, only to give up the sport for lack of a developed adult game.
The J-League is designed to provide them with a focus for an adult interest
in soccer.
Japan's strategy is all part of its internationalisation. Sumo reinforces
its sporting isolation, while baseball is a reflection of its special
relationship with the US. Soccer is a way of Japan announcing it wants to be
part of a wider international sporting community, just as its desire for a
permanent seat on the United Nations' security council symbolises its wish
to play a wider role in international politics.
Those wider political responsibilities will bring risks that Japan is
ill-prepared to shoulder: putting its troops in places where they could be
killed, for one. Japan's international soccer ambitions could also create
confrontations for which it is not ready.
When the day comes, later this decade, for England to play Japan in Tokyo,
what will the adolescent Japanese choir make of it when its polite chorus of
'Nippon, Nippon' is met by a rousing English war cry from the throats of
thousands of fans bred in Chelsea's Shed, Arsenal's North Bank and
Millwall's Den?
Britain should once again be ready to learn from Japan. Not about making
cars or video recorders but, this time, about soccer and its culture.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Uprising of Russian right took Yeltsin government by
surprise: The day Moscow teetered on the brink
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT of Pres-ident Boris Yeltsin was completely unprepared for the
uprising that led to the storming of the banned Russian parliament and the
subsequent gun battles in which nearly 200 people died.
It has also emerged since last weekend's uprising that the Russian army
spent several hours last Sunday debating whether it should 'become involved
in politics' as armed supporters of the Russian parliament roamed the
streets of Moscow, captured the mayoral offices and attacked the television
centre.
The army's long period of inaction in the crucial hours after the uprising
is becoming a cause of bitter debate within the Russian government.
Radical ministers and officials, convinced that only the mobilisation of
their supporters on the streets saved the day, are now calling for Mr
Yeltsin to order a clean-out of the Defence, Interior and Security
ministries.
Moscow's military city commandant also warned last night that he would take
'decisive' retaliatory action against any anti-government groups holding
weekend demonstrations, banned under a state of emergency.
A detailed account by eyewitnesses inside the Kremlin during the day when
Moscow teetered on the brink of civil strife paints a picture of a
government caught completely by surprise. They say that:
The Kremlin authorities did not expect an armed uprising.
Senior members of the Defence ministry sat far into the night debating the
issue, long after the defenders of the White House, the parliament building,
had become attackers.
Groups of democrat supporters were about to be armed in order to attempt to
put down the parliamentary revolt.
The Russian central bank refused to advance credits on Sunday night to the
government - which had asked for large emergency reserves of cash.
Confidential assessments of the situation by the security forces had put a
very low probability of any armed attack by the parliamentary forces, in
spite of the large quantity of arms known to be in the White House and the
presence of armed detachments of extremist forces.
Summoned by a phone call, Mr Sergei Filatov, the president's chief of staff,
saw the demonstrators from the window of his car as he rushed back to the
Kremlin at about 3.30 pm - to be followed shortly by Mr Yeltsin,
helicoptered from his dacha at Arkhangelsk, outside Moscow.
The atmosphere, according to those present, in the presidential offices was
panicky.
The panic was largely because Mr Yeltsin and his staff could not get through
to General Pavel Grachev, the defence minister. Much time - according to Mr
Sergei Yuzhenkov, deputy head of the Federal Information Service, who was
closely involved in the day's events - was spent in discussing which of the
military men close to the president should go to Gen Grachev to ask him to
bring in the army. 'The trouble was,' Mr Yuzhenkov said yesterday, 'no one
had good relations with him.'
Within the Council of Ministers building in Old Square, next to the Kremlin,
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister, grew increasingly
concerned as he saw the Interior Ministry forces protecting the White House
melt away. Mr Yuzhenkov phoned to ask if he could say the army was on its
way to deal with the uprising. No, said Mr Gaidar, he could not.
The two men then decided they had to act: Mr Gaidar made an appeal on TV for
detachments of volunteers to form outside the Moscow City Council building
opposite the Kremlin. The detachments were to have been armed on the orders
of Mr Yuri Luzhkov, the Moscow city mayor. Several thousand volunteers
responded, although arms were not handed out.
Meanwhile, the top army generals at the Defence Ministry convened under Gen
Grachev. Faced with many of his colleagues who insisted on the army's
non-involvement, he went round the table, demanding that each give his own
position. Mr Yuzhenkov says: 'The army was a hostage to its own slogan -
that it should not be involved in politics. But the decision was not to get
involved in politics: it was to stop an attack on the state.'
The government decided early in the evening to create a large fund of cash
with which it could pay and feed troops. Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy
premier for finance who was in the Council of Ministers' building on Sunday
night, said: 'There was a decision to create some cash reserves in the
government if things got worse. The Bank didn't refuse - Mr (Viktor)
Gerashchenko (the chairman) is too clever for that - they just delayed.'
The army's deployment against the White House has received official
eulogies. But Mr Gaidar and Mr Yuzhenkov have criticised security forces.
'We need a real clean-out of these ministries now.' said Mr Yuzhenkov.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Lucas wants Rover chairman as its new chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, BERNARD GRAY and ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LUCAS Industries, the troubled UK automotive and aerospace components
company, has offered the post of chief executive to Mr George Simpson,
deputy chief executive of British Aerospace and chairman of Rover Group, its
vehicles subsidiary.
Lucas had hoped to be able to announce his acceptance to coincide with the
presentation of its annual results on Monday, but it is understood that Mr
Simpson has still not decided to take the job.
Lucas, which reported profits down from Pounds 83m to Pounds 22.5m last
year, promised in March that it would appoint a new chief executive as soon
as possible and hoped a new non-executive chairman would be nominated to
take over from Sir Anthony Gill, the group's chairman and chief executive,
by next month's annual general meeting.
The direction of Lucas's management has been in doubt for some time. Last
year Mr Tony Edwards, head of the group's aerospace division, was made chief
executive designate. Mr Edwards was later told that the board did not
consider him suitable for the job and he moved to rival TI Group.
Mr David Hankinson, Lucas's finance director, left earlier last year, when
he lost out to Mr Edwards in the race to become chief executive. Sir Anthony
had been due to retire last year, but agreed to remain until the succession
was sorted out.
Mr Simpson, who has spent most of the past 24 years with Rover (previously
British Leyland and BLMC), has been instrumental in transforming the
fortunes of the previously lossmaking UK carmaker.
The dilemma he faces is whether to leave Rover at the point where the hard
work of previous years appears poised to yield significant profits, and the
possibility has been created that it could again become an independent
company, floated off by BAe. Mr Simpson would be the obvious candidate to
lead the company.
At Lucas he would again face an uphill struggle to turn around a group
fighting for a place in the competitive automotive and aerospace components
market.

FT  09 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Greycoat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Greycoat's management, which ran the property company into the ground, now
faces another big embarrassment. Having forcefully argued that the company
had no future if the Postel rescue package was voted down, the management is
now obliged to try to prove the opposite to disbelieving shareholders. The
arbitrageurs who have piled into Greycoat's preference shares and blocked
the deal clearly believe there is a better alternative for themselves, at
least. Perhaps they draw inspiration from Amstrad where the obdurate
shareholders who voted down Mr Alan Sugar's plans to take the company
private must feel vindicated by the subsequent recovery in its share price.
But the parallels are inexact. Greycoat is surely right that it can no
longer continue to exist in its current form. But that is not quite the same
as saying it cannot exist at all. If Greycoat were put into receivership,
there would certainly be little prospect of any relief for preference
shareholders. The banks' loans are well secured on the properties and the
receivers would have no obligation to hang on for a recovery in values.
Administration may offer more promising chances of some salvation. But the
real hope is that there is a better alternative offer for refinancing
Greycoat's assets lurking in the wings. It could conceivably be that the
intimidating presence of Postel may have deterred bidders from making
themselves known before. That slim hope will now be put to the test.

FT  09 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: US economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Another disappointing set of US jobs figures did nothing for confidence on
Wall Street or the dollar. While the headline growth in employment during
September looks healthy enough, the unwillingness of manufacturing companies
to hire permanent staff looks like the Achilles heel of the US economy.
President Clinton's proposed reform of the healthcare system could make
matters worse by increasing employment costs. The healthcare industry -
itself an engine of private sector job creation - faces a period of great
uncertainty.
While consumer spending is growing, the Federal Reserve is unlikely to be
diverted from its cautious attitude towards interest rates. The worry must
be that a weak jobs market will eventually catch up with consumers. There is
no sign of that yet, but the savings ratio remains low by historic standards
and federal tax increases will start to bite early next year.
The fourth quarter may hold out more promise if companies start to rebuild
stocks which have been run down over the summer. There is also the promise
of increased construction activity as Midwest states clear up after the
floods. But unless that burst of activity provides the spark of confidence
which is currently lacking, it is hard to see the improvement being
sustained.

<TEXT>
As Mr George Simpson, British Aerospace's deputy chief executive, ponders
whether to stay with the company this weekend, BAe's turbulent last two
years will give him plenty of food for thought. Since the ill-fated rights
issue, departure of Professor Sir Roland Smith, and Pounds 1bn write-off
against the regional jet business, BAe has made solid progress. A further
large Tornado contract with Saudi Arabia has been secured, the Eurofighter
reprieved, Ballast Nedam and the corporate jet business sold. Perhaps most
importantly to Mr Simpson, Rover has done well in an appalling European car
market.
Recently, however, the news for the company has been less good. Eurofighter
has encountered technical problems and the negotiations over forming a joint
venture for the regional jet business with Taiwan Aerospace have been bogged
down in detailed disputes. The time must be fast approaching when BAe should
withdraw from discussions rather than endure further uncertainty.
Yet the collapse of talks with Taiwan would not now be the disaster they
would have been 18 months ago. BAe has released cash through its asset
sales. More importantly, the company has renegotiated its banking
arrangements to remove the minimum net worth constraint which had
effectively prevented it from writing off other businesses. It can now
rationalise its turbo-prop aircraft or missiles operations without undue
worry. The balance sheet would be left a little weaker, but well within
interest cover banking limits. The main risk to BAe from Taiwan is not
financial, but that further procrastination will look like management
dither.

US investors certainly seem to have started the quarter in some style. It
appears thanks largely to them that the London market managed to shrug off
disappointment at the lack of an interest rate cut at the Tory party
conference and close the week at a new high. Of course, the possibility
remains that base rates may be cut at the time of the Budget. UK investors
may also not have fully grasped the possibility that, once down, rates could
stay low for some time. Yet the market could be on dangerous ground if it is
relying on foreign money to drive share prices higher meanwhile.
In price/earnings terms London still looks cheap against Wall Street. Strip
out the exceptional charges which have reduced US earnings in recent years,
though, and the difference becomes much smaller. There is thus less logic
than immediately appears in US investors diversifying into the UK because
valuations in their own market are stretched. It is hard to imagine a
correction on Wall Street which did not affect London and other
international markets as well.
Similarly, at some point one must question the link between bond yields and
share prices. It is all well and good to claim that lower long-term interest
rates allow shares to trade on a higher multiple. But companies must also
deliver the earnings growth implicit in their rating. That will not be easy
if bond yields are low because poor world growth prospects will keep
inflation at bay. The actual results reported by UK companies during the
interim season may validate the market's recent rise: the generally cautious
tone of accompanying trading statements does not suggest much room for more.

to investors

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices ended little changed yesterday after a mixed September
employment report buoyed bond markets but left equity investors confused,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.11 at 3,584.74, well
off its lows for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500
finished 1.12 higher at 460.30, while the Amex composite ended up 0.75 at
464.70, and the Nasdaq composite up 1.78 at 764.27. Trading volume on the
NYSE was 244m shares.
The markets opened firmer, buoyed by surging bond prices. The Treasury
market rally was sparked by the morning release of the September employment
report. Although this showed a 156,000 increase in non-farm payrolls last
month, in line with expectations, bond market investors focused on the
underlying weakness in manufacturing jobs revealed by the data. Deciding
that the overall picture of the labour market still looked weak, investors
bought bonds in heavy numbers, pushing the benchmark 30-year issue up 1 1/4
points, and lowering the yield to 5.917 per cent.
Although the sharp drop in bond yields initially supported stocks,
especially interest rate-sensitive sectors such as banks, the equity markets
gradually turned tail, and by late morning prices were firmly rooted in
negative territory as investors judged the jobs data to be, on balance, bad
for stocks. A late round of buy progams, however, helped prices recover all
their losses and end the day with slight gains across the board. Like the
wider market, bank stocks struggled to hold their early advances. Citicorp
finished down Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 38 1/4 , Chemical off Dollars  1/4 at
Dollars 45, and NationsBank down Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 52.
Brokerage stocks, which would normally benefit from falling interest rates,
also see-sawed, opening with heavy losses but bouncing back to end higher or
mixed. They were originally undermined by analysts' comments that the sector
may have peaked after a long bull phase, but expectations of strong earnings
growth remain high. Merrill Lynch ended up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 98 1/8 ,
Salomon up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 48 and PaineWebber unchanged at Dollars
32 3/8 . Morgan Stanley failed to rally, finishing down Dollars 1 3/4 at
Dollars 84 3/4 . Sears, Roebuck was a notable loser, falling Dollars 1 1/2
to Dollars 56 5/8 as concerns about the economy and consumer spending hurt
retailing stocks.
On the American Stock Exchange, Amdahl fell Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 5 after
the company warned of a third-quarter loss.
Canada
TORONTO posted a modest gain in light trading. The TSE-300 composite index
rose 6.65 to close at 4,067.44. Today's volume of 48.8m shares was worth
CDollars 481.1m.

FT  09 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: Australia powers through 2,000 level -
The equity rally has not been dampened so far by the political crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A stalled government budget, the prospect that parliament could be
dissolved, an unemployment rate close to 11 per cent, and weak commodity
prices do not seem the most promising ingredients for an Australian stock
market surge.
Yet, in spite of these negative factors, the All Ordinaries index powered
through the 2,000 mark this week, reaching new post-1987 crash highs. It
closed yesterday at 2,026, for a week's rise of 2.7 per cent.
On an annual basis, the advance is even more remarkable: last November, the
All Ordinaries dipped to a low of 1,355. Since then, it has risen by over 50
per cent, adding more than ADollars 80bn (Dollars 52bn) to the value of
Australian shares.
Analysts have few doubts about the forces that are driving the advance.
The first is corporate profitability. The recent reporting season - most
companies have June year-ends - showed widespread improvements in earnings.
According to one tally of 500 listed companies, total after-tax profits
increased by 98 per cent. This was partly due to a much lower level of
'one-off' charges, suggesting that recession-induced write-offs are coming
to an end. But profits before tax and 'abnormals' were also up by about 49
per cent.
As analysts at Macquarie Bank point out, much of this advance stemmed from
cost-savings and production efficiencies which led to higher margins, rather
than increases in demand.
Those same 500 companies saw sales rise by a mere 4.5 per cent.
Assuming that there are more productivity benefits to be garnered, this
should mean that earnings advances can be sustained even if world economic
conditions remain lacklustre. 'There's not much downside risk in the current
year,' suggest Macquarie analysts. 'Future earnings advances are not heavily
contingent on sales.'
In this respect, then, the country's high unemployment rate, which stood at
a seasonally-adjusted 10.9 per cent in September, is not entirely unwelcome.
Most economists believe that the figure reflects the structural changes
which are taking place in the corporate sector, as a nation adjusts to lower
import tariff barriers and companies fight to become competitive. Employees
may lose in this situation, but investors gain.
The second motor behind the market's advance is the relatively low interest
rate environment, and the fact that real returns on competing fixed interest
investments and money funds look unappealing at present.
Finally, seasonal factors may be weighing in. The stock market tends to pick
up in the nation's summer months, and reinvestment of dividend payouts after
the June year-end helps share prices higher.
Nevertheless, there are some potential worries on the horizon. One is the
amount of corporate fund-raising that is under way. The ADollars 2.4bn
Woolworths flotation and current ADollars 1.6bn Commonwealth Bank share sale
may have grabbed the headlines, but they have been accompanied by a raft of
smaller issues.
However, opinions differ about the impact that this supply of new paper will
have on share prices generally. Mr Peter Masi, senior dealer at BZW in
Sydney, suggests that many investors have been making money on recent
issues, and some of these gains are being reinvested in other stocks.
Nevertheless, he warns that the weight of new issues could cause some
liquidity problems in the coming months, putting a temporary damper on the
market's progress.
Taking a slightly longer view, analysts at Macquarie Bank predict that about
ADollars 12.5bn could be raised through equity issues over the 12 months to
end-June 1994. But this, they point out, would only represent a 5 to 6 per
cent increase in terms of total market capitalisation.
The major question is why the political situation is having so little
impact.
Part of the answer may lie in the fact that corporate improvements, and the
eventual recovery of world demand, are independent of the Canberra hothouse.
It is also unclear where the budget impasse will eventually lead, and the
senate is coming up for a two-week recess.
Nevertheless, the uncertainty has already told on the Australian dollar, and
Mr Bernie Fraser, the Reserve Bank governor, did acknowledge recently that
there might come a time when interest rates would need to rise to help
support the currency. In that case, warns one analyst, share prices might
not look quite so appealing.

FT  09 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Dax breaks 2,000 level in
afternoon enthusiasm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff

<TEXT>
AFTERNOON enthusiasm left bourses back on the upgrade, writes Our Markets
Staff.
FRANKFURT finally broke through 2,000 and stayed there, the DAX index
closing up 7.97 at a new all-time high 2,005.10, up 4.9 per cent on the
week, and moving on to 2,015.13 at the end of the post-bourse.
Mr Harry Jaarsma, at Dresdner Bank, said that many traders went short at the
approach of the 2,000 level, and had to cover later. In a similar move,
Schering, the pharmaceuticals group, rose another DM36 to DM1,058 after
clearing DM1,000 on Thursday.
Other big winners included Douglas, the specialist retailer incorporating
Europe's largest perfumery chain, up DM19.50 to DM574 after tips from
Kleinwort Benson, and Dresdner this week; and RWE, the utility group,
interest rate sensitive, expected to declare a higher dividend next
Wednesday, up DM11.10 on the session and another DM4.50 to DM477.50 by the
London close.
Turnover eased from DM9.6bn to DM9.4bn. Carmakers were weak, Volkswagen
falling DM5 to DM375, and Daimler another DM3.80 to DM744 after it said that
it would take a DM1.5bn charge from its ongoing job cuts programme against
its third quarter earnings.
PARIS remained uncertain about the future direction of LVMH and the shares
fell a further FFr60 to FFr3,640, bringing the losses since Tuesday, when
market rumours surfaced and downgrades on the stock began to be released, to
6 per cent.
Some analysts believe that the drinks and luxury goods group might be about
to announce a corporate restructuring, which could be connected to the
cross-shareholding it has with Guinness. With the French group burdened by
high gearing, one view is that it might look to various ways of raising
capital, with a rights issue not being out of the question in some people's
minds.
The CAC-40 index rose 8.97 to 2,156.38, up 1.9 per cent on the week. Peugeot
recovered some early losses to end off FFr5 at FFr645 as investors took the
view that, in spite of slightly better than expected first half results, the
situation at the car group remains depressed. BSN, the food group, shed
FFr26 to FFr862 on a similar earnings outlook.
ZURICH finished close to Wednesday's record high, still supported by the
prospect of lower interest rates. The SMI index rose 5.6 to 2,533.6 for a
2.1 per cent advance over the week.
Interest rate sensitive banks and insurers were major beneficiaries. UBS
bearers added SFr12 to a record SFr1,244. Among insurers finishing a strong
week with further rises, Zurich Insurance added SFr18 to SFr1,338 and
Winterthur rose SFr7 to SFr712.
Mr Mirko Sangiorgio of Bank Julius Baer noted that the insurance sector was
benefiting from plans to change its weighting in the SMI index from the
current 4 per cent to 12 per cent from January 1, at the expense of
chemicals, foods and banks.
MILAN 's Comit index fell 5.46 to 590.70, down 0.7 per cent on the week.
Credito Italiano fell L90 to L2,534; the bank had been quoted 3 per cent
higher in pre-bourse dealings after Iri, the state holding company,
reaffirmed its plans to sell it off before the end of the year.
Ferruzzi finished L8.50 higher at L333.80, in heavy speculative and volatile
trade as its main creditor banks met to discuss the rescue package.
Cirio, Bertolli, de Rica, the state controlled foods group, dipped L70 or
6.2 per cent to L1,061 following the announcement of its sale to a
co-operative group. Olivetti fell another L67 to L1,857, analysts tending to
blame arbitrage activity between the stock and a convertible bond launched
by its parent, Cir.
AMSTERDAM reacted to the news overnight that the state's 7 per cent
shareholding in ING, the financial services group, had been sold to the
healthcare workers' pension fund by marking the shares up 80 cents to a new
1993 high of Fl 77.90.
The CBS Tendency index closed up 0.3 at 128.0, for a week's gain of 2.2 per
cent.
In contrast, Boskalis, the dredging group, lost Fl 1.00 to Fl 39.10, after
the announcement that it was to purchase Ballast Nedam, a construction
subsidiary of British Aerospace, for around Fl 500m.

FT  09 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Strong demand takes
Kuala Lumpur to peak

<TEXT>
OPTION-related selling depressed share prices in the morning session, but a
later rise in the futures market prompted arbitrage buying, and the Nikkei
average finally closed moderately higher ahead of the three-day weekend,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei rose 113.01 to 20,378.64, 0.5 per cent up on the week, after a
low of 20,180.02 and a high of 20,405.04. Prices lost ground on selling
related to the settlement of October options contracts. The index rose in
the last 30 minutes of trading on arbitrage linked buying.
Volume totalled 320m shares against 297m. Advances led declines by 532 to
438 with 198 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first
section stocks closed up 9.61 at 1,656.40 and, in London, the ISE Nikkei 50
index rose 2.6 to close at 1287.21.
Traders sold small-capital stocks included in the Nikkei 225 index ahead of
an announcement of a new capitalisation weighted index by the Nihon Keizai
Shimbun after the market closed. Speculation that the new Nikkei index would
be similar to the capitalisation weighted Topix index prompted buying of
Topix components.
After the market closed, the new Nikkei index, composed of 300 stocks, was
announced. The Osaka stock exchange is expected to launch a futures contract
on the new index in the near future.
Some car makers were strong on hopes that they would become components of
the new index. Mitsubishi Motors, which was included in the new benchmark,
rose Y7 to Y839.
On the other hand, small capital components of the Nikkei 225 lost ground.
Toho Rayon fell Y21 to Y526 and Nitto Boseki declined Y6 to Y384. Both
stocks were not included in the Nikkei 300.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 27.70 to 22,374.06 in volume of 13.7m shares.
Dealers liquidate positions ahead of the long weekend, although the index
recouped some of the losses on late buying.
Roundup
Many Pacific Rim markets paused for breath at the end of a high-performance
week.
KUALA LUMPUR was an exception, finding strong retail and institutional
demand which took the composite index 10.28 ahead to a record high of
884.62, a 2.9 per cent gain on the week. The market took its lead from a
MDollars 2 rise to MDollars 29 by Genting on continued talk of a floating
casino deal.
BANGKOK continued to move ahead in calmer trade as foreign and local
institutions overcame the impact of selling by local individual investors of
blue chips and large-capitalisation stocks.
The SET index gained 10.12 to 1,098.64, 10.7 per cent higher on the week,
with turnover still high at Bt16.4bn but dull in comparison with the record
Bt26.9bn on Thursday.
HONG KONG closed easier but off the day's lows in subdued trade with Chinese
investors taking profits ahead of the weekend. The Hang Seng index, which
had closed at record highs over the previous five sessions, ended 61.23
lower at 8,005.56, but this was still a 4.3 per cent advance on the week.
Turnover shrank to HKDollars 3.86bn from HKDollars 6.59bn on Thursday.
Blue chips fell across the board while Sun Hung Kai Properties slipped 50
cents to HKDollars 42.50 ahead of annual results due after the market
closed.
NEW ZEALAND weathered a morning bout of profit-taking and the NZSE 40
capital index finished 2.22 lower at 2,016.74 in heavy trading, still 3.9
per cent higher over the week.
TAIWAN extended early losses to end lower across the board after
profit-taking eroded Thursday's 2.1 per cent surge. The weighted index ended
31.75 lower at 3,863.19 in turnover of TDollars 15.48bn against Thursday's
TDollars 18.99bn, for a 1.5 per cent rise on the week.
Banking stocks were the heaviest losers, with Taipei Business Bank down
TDollars 1.50 to TDollars 62.50. China Steel sank 40 cents to TDollars
17.70.
MANILA moved ahead on the strength of blue chips and the composite index
added 21.68 to 1,982.72, 1.2 per cent higher on the week.
SEOUL took time to consolidate in the absence of news to drive the market
and the composite index edged 3.24 lower to 714.58 for a 0.7 per cent fall
on the week.
SINGAPORE drifted easier with Malaysian speculative issues continuing to
fuel market activity amid rumours of corporate restructuring and takeovers.
The Straits Times Industrial index eased 5.96 to 2,031.45, for a 0.6 per
cent rise over the week.

FT  09 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Strong close takes Footsie to peak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LITTLE unwillingly at first, the UK stock market moved forward to a clear
new closing peak yesterday, with buying pressure increasing at the end of
the day when dealing is effectively for next week. The market had already
begun to joust with its previous closing high when Mr John Major, the UK
prime minister, rose to deliver his keenly-awaited speech to the UK
Conservative party conference. Equities were encouraged by strong gains in
government bonds and also by a renewed advance in German stock markets.
The FT-SE Index closed at the day's best, with the final reading of 3,108.6
showing a rise of 16.2. Turnover was unimpressive, however, and price gains
often reflected a squeeze on marketmakers' trading positions when the
December futures contract moved higher.
This week has brought a gain of 69.3 points, or about 2.3 per cent, on the
Footsie Index, and the marketmakers have been running out of stock to meet
their commitments. However, the equity account has another week to run.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index also found support, gaining 6.8 to 3,477.3; this
wider-ranging market measuring rod remains around 1 per cent below its
all-time high. Non-Footsie stocks made up about 57 per cent of yesterday's
Seaq total of 477.4m shares, down sharply from 572.1m on the previous day.
Thursday's retail business, worth Pounds 1.31bn, remained comfortably inside
the market's range of profitability.
Optimism on base rate prospects have been strengthened this week by comments
from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, who stressed
commitment to strengthening the economic recovery.
Yesterday's sharp fall in yields in long-dated government bonds provided
fresh encouragement for equities which have been led by the bond market
rally over the past two months. Long dated gilts rose by around  5/8 ,
implying confidence ahead of next week's list of economic statistics on
retail prices, industrial output, unemployment and wages. Near-dated gilts
edged slightly higher. London gilts followed a strong performance from US
bonds.
Pharmaceutical stocks gave a good lead to the blue chip sector but oil
stocks looked less certain. There were gains in the banking sector, which
has been identified as perhaps the chief beneficiary from base rate
reductions, while the consumer sectors advanced.

FT  09 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING in the FT-SE future formed a mixed pattern with a sluggish start and
a late rally, Christine Buckley writes.
In a dull morning, volume was low in the December contract on the FT-SE 100.
Much of the trading was conducted by independent traders although some US
buying was in evidence.
After opening at 3,115, the contract dipped to its lowest level of the day
at 3,109 in the mid morning.
But some vigour was stimulated in the afternoon. US unemployment figures
triggered a strong US bond performance and similar strong showings were seen
in European markets. A technical spur came from traders buying into the
contract to avoid short positions on Monday.
With some brokers system buying, the contract climbed about 20 points in the
last hour or so to reach a close of 3,143 with 6,298 contracts traded - the
technical push taking the contract to a 17 point lead over the fair value
premium to cash.
In traded options, FT-SE volume was strong at 17,903 lots.

FT  09 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: United Biscuits firm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A bright start from United Biscuits (UB) saw the shares open at 10p higher,
prompting speculation that one of the market's favourite bid candidates was
back in play. Unilever was yesterday's choice as the most likely predator,
although analysts pointed out that any such move could trigger a monopolies
inquiry over their frozen foods businesses. Identifying several other
problem areas, Mr Carl Short at Strauss Turnbull said: 'A Unilever bid for
United Biscuits is one of the least likely situations.'
Dealers said that UB shares had been squeezed up because of a buy order
being split between two brokers. UB shares closed 16 ahead at 368p in
average volume of 2m, while Unilever lost 5 to 1052p.
Leading property shares surged forward after dealers said James Capel was
renewing its bullish stance. Brixton Estate gained 7 to 232p, Frogmore
Estates 15 to 455p, Land Securities 9 to 703p and Slough Estates 5 to 269p.
British Land, up 15 at 413p, was being mentioned as a possible bidder for
Greycoat following the latter's failure to gain approval for its financial
restructuring via Postel. Despite the Greycoat board's protestations before
yesterday's egm that the company would go into receivership if the vote was
lost, property analysts specluated that British Land was only one of several
potential predators.
The appeal of Glaxo's high yield continued to lure investors faced with the
probability of lower interest rates, and the stock moved up 12 to 666p.
Zeneca also went ahead strongly with a rise of 10 to 755p.
An upbeat presentation to analysts and institutions by Reuters bolstered its
share price with a rise of 27 to 1518p. The London meeting was a follow-on
from similar exercises in New York and Los Angeles.
ADT slipped back 44 to 579p, on speculation that 24 per cent stake holder
Laidlaw, the waste services group, might be considering selling its stake
after the departure of Laidlaw's chief executive.
Among aviation stocks, British Airways' were in demand and put on 7 1/2 to
375 1/2 p, with SG Warburg, which has been recommending the stock, said to
have been among the day's leading buyers.
Container leasing and transport rental group Tiphook remained friendless
following Thursday's profits warning and negative statement. The shares
tumbled another 46 to 123p.
Hopes that the proposed Pounds 250m joint venture between British Aerospace
and Taiwan Aerospace Corporation will still go ahead brought a turnaround in
the shares.
Further suggestions that the deal was close to collapse saw the shares
decline 6 to 387p at first, before renewed hopes fuelled a bounce which saw
the shares finally a net 11 ahead at 304p.
Profit-taking together with a touch of nervous trading saw Lucas Industries
shed 2 to 155p, ahead of next week's figures. Market watchers expect Mr
George Simpson, currently deputy chairman at BAe, to be confirmed as the new
chief executive at Lucas.
A doubled blow hit shares in Automated Security which sent them falling
sharply. BZW, joint broker to the company, resigned after the company issued
a profits warning.
In a busy telecoms sector, profit-taking set Cable and Wireless back, the
shares losing 14 to 899p. Vodafone was said to have weakened as BZW
downgraded the stock, the shares falling 6 to 526p.
Micro Focus, meeting analysts this week, retreated 160 to 1450p.
GKN fell 5 to 462p as investors took aboard the downturn in European car
sales.
Construction shares continued their good run. Tarmac bounced 4 to 143p and
Havelock Europa 19 to 96p.

FT  09 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Oils gloomy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A downbeat mood hung over oil stocks after a meeting of the London oil
analysts group produced a generally bearish stance on the outlook for
European refining.
The group spoke pessimistically about general prospects in Europe. The
analysts also pointed to the costs of meeting increasingly stiff
environmental demands as a check on the performance of companies with
interests in European refining.
While the group did not envisage downgrading profit forecasts, the gloomy
conclusions led to a decline for many of the oil stocks.
Burmah closed 13 down at 770p; BP lost 2 1/2 to 323p; Enterprise gave up 2
to 466p and Lasmo lost 1 1/2 to 140p. Shell managed to buck the downward
trend, gaining 4 to 684p.

FT  09 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Boots and Fisons active
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DRUGS sector was alight with talk that Boots and Fisons are considering
merging their ethical drugs divisions. However, Fisons later denied the
story and drugs analysts were also dismissive. Speculation over both
businesses has been rife after they suffered unrelated setbacks over the
past year. Fisons has been hit by regulatory problems in the US, while Boots
was forced to abandon its heart drug Manoplax in July at a cost of Pounds
35m.
Boots, under pressure from anxious analysts and institutional investors over
the losses, said then that all options would be considered in reviewing the
future of its drugs business. There has been regular speculation since over
the company's likely course of action, ranging from an outright sale to a
restructuring. Any announcement on its future is unlikely to come before
Boots results on November 4. The company is also widely expected to announce
the rationalisation of its Do It All home improvement venture. Boots shares
gained 6 to 489p, Fisons 2 1/2 to 165 1/2 p.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Money Markets: Short rates stay low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MONETARY conditions in the UK continued in relaxed style at the end of the
first week of the new quarter with short-term money rates staying low and
the day's liquidity shortage easily dealt with, writes Peter John.
Meanwhile, short sterling futures remained in the wings with volumes low and
the range staying tight.
At the start of trading yesterday, the Bank of England forecast a cash
shortage for the clearing banks of around Pounds 1.1bn. The figure was below
the high levels seen earlier in the week but still higher than the norm.
Most of the shortage was dealt with immediately as the central bank bought
Pounds 950m of treasury bills for repurchase by the market on November 1 at
5 29/32 per cent interest. Shortly afterwards, the Bank bought Pounds 61m of
Bands One and Two bills at 5 7/8 per cent.
In the afternoon, the shortage was revised upwards to Pounds 1.15bn and the
Bank provided a further Pounds 164m, taking total help for the day to Pounds
1.075bn.
The comfortable monetary conditions saw overnight rates falling as low as 3
1/2 per cent at one stage. However, those conditions are unlikely to
continue next week and dealers said they were seeing the Monday-for-Tuesday
rate quoted as high as 6 3/16 per cent.
Short sterling held within a four-basis point range as one dealer commented:
'We're all waiting to see what the weekend press has to say about John
Major's speech.' Certainly, the Prime Minister's speech itself, the key
point of the Tory Party conference, carried little in the way of market
sensitive information and while the most heavily traded futures contract is
discounting a third of a percentage point off base rates few believe that
further cuts will be made before the November budget.
The December contract rose 2 basis points to 94.38, the high of the day, on
turnover of less than 12,000 lots.
German call money remained steady at around 6.82 per cent with some light
demand from banks looking to build up reserves ahead of the weekend.
Dealers said banks would lose liquidity as yesterday was the pay date for
some DM1.2bn of bonds issued earlier in the week by the central bank of
Lower Saxony. However, the volume was not high enough to put significant
pressure on the market.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange: Dollar plunges on jobs data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISAPPOINTING US employment figures quashed hopes that the US economy might
be back on track yesterday and sent the dollar down sharply against a wide
range of currencies writes Peter John.
Initially, the rise in the non-farm payroll data was as expected. A poll of
30 economists pointed to a rise of 155,000 in September employment compared
with an August contraction of 39,000 jobs. The final figure came in at
156,000 and the August figure was revised down by only 2,000 to a fall of
41,000.
However, when the figures were released at 1.30pm European time, the dollar
sank more than two pfennigs against the D-Mark and lost around a cent
against the Japanese yen and sterling.
Economists said a break-down of the data showed that more than half of
September's rise represented teachers returning to work after the school
break. Also, there had been widespread hope that the August figure might
have been revised upwards as it clashed with household employment data
showing a rise of 409,000.
Mr George Magnus, chief economist with SG Warburg said: 'It is a very
sluggish employment picture which means weak income growth and weak consumer
sales.'
The figures benefited the Treasury market, which quakes at prospects of
increasing inflation, but failed to help the dollar, which SG Warburg sees
falling below DM1.60 soon.
The US currency was further hit by some heavy expiry of D-Mark/dollar
options. The expiry was estimated at more than Dollars 1bn and prompted
dealers to sell dollars to hedge their positions. The dollar plunged to a
low of DM. 6010. By the end of official dealing in London it had recovered
some lost territory to close at DM1.6040, down from DM1.6230. It fell below
Y105 against the Yen at one stage but closed at Y105.50, up from Y105.10
previously and sterling was stronger at Dollars 1.5360, up from Dollars
1.5225.
The D-Mark was generally strong, particularly against the French franc whose
weakness reflected the rate cut dilemma of the Bank of France. The central
bank desperately needs to ease monetary policy to invigorate the economy but
has been thwarted by pressure on the currency. Yesterday, the D-Mark rose to

DETROIT Diesel, the manufacturer of heavy duty diesel engines headed by Mr
Roger Penske, the former racing car driver, came to the New York market
yesterday with an initial public offering of shares which raised some
Dollars 95m, writes Martin Dickson.
The offering of 4.75m shares was priced at Dollars 20 a share, ahead of the
Dollars 16 to Dollars 18 estimated in the preliminary prospectus, indicating
solid demand. The stock traded as high as Dollars 26 1/8 in first-day
dealing before closing at Dollars 25 7/8 . A former loss-making unit of
General Motors, the company has been turned around under Mr Penske's
management.

SHARES in ING, the Dutch financial services group, rose to a record level
yesterday on news that the government had sold its stake of nearly 7 per
cent in the company to a large domestic pension fund.
PGGM, the healthcare workers' pension fund, bought the shares, worth Fl
1.27bn (Dollars 690m), as a long-term investment. The transaction makes PGGM
the largest single investor in ING, just ahead of insurance companies Aegon
and Amev.
The 17.67m shares were sold for Fl 71.64 each, a discount of about Fl 3 to
ING's average share price of Fl 74.66 in the 10 trading days up to October
5. The shares made further gains in the days leading up to the announcement.
The shares closed yesterday at Fl 77.90, up Fl 0.80 as traders welcomed the
sale of shares that had been overhanging the market.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NIPPON OIL, Japan's largest distributor of petroleum products, has revised
upwards its pre-tax profit forecast for the half year to September after
firm sales of its high-priced high octane gasoline and foreign exchange
gains.
Unlike the country's export oriented businesses which are facing sharp
profit falls due to the strong yen, the rise in the currency has increased
profit margins at Japanese companies which rely on imports, such as
petroleum related companies and power utilities.
The company expects non-consolidated interim pre-tax profits to total Y19bn
(Dollars 180m), Y4bn higher than its original forecast.
The figure, however, remains lower than the previous year's Y20.6bn due to a
decline in financial gains.
For the whole year, pre-tax profits are expected to remain unchanged from
the previous forecast of Y40bn, as the company revised down annual sales
estimates to Y1,900bn from Y2,000bn. Sales are expected to decline due to
the continuing slump in the economy and declines in wholesale prices.
Osaka Gas, the country's second largest city gas supplier, meanwhile raised
its pre-tax profit projection for the first six months to September by
Y2.5bn to Y10.5bn, 46 per cent higher than the same period last year.
The company benefited from a cool summer, a higher yen and lower crude oil
prices.

nine-month loss at parent
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DAIMLER-BENZ'S Stuttgart-based parent company made a loss of DM1.5bn
(Dollars 924m) in the first nine months of this year, according to Mr Edzard
Reuter, group chairman.
The company, which recently announced a first-half deficit of DM949bn, would
offer no further details on Mr Reuter's forecast, made in a television
interview on Thursday.
However, officials confirmed that a DM1.5bn charge to cover the cost of job
losses would all be taken in the third quarter instead of being spread over
the second half as originally planned.
'If we record an operating loss for the third quarter then in any case the
January to September loss will be more than DM1.5bn,' a spokesman said. It
was not clear if the turnround point had been reached.
The first half deficit, reported under US accounting standards adopted for
the technology group's listing on the New York stock exchange earlier this
month, included DM300m losses on exchange rates and an unspecified amount
for job cuts, he added.
In common with other automotive industry stocks, the Daimler share price
weakened in Frankfurt yesterday - down DM3.8 at DM744 - even though the blue
chip Dax index closed at a record high.
Daimler, which includes Mercedes-Benz, the AEG group, Deutsche Aerospace and
Debis financial and computer services, is in the middle of a radical
cost-cutting programme.

PGGM, the healthcare workers' pension fund, purchased the shares, worth Fl

The transaction makes PGGM the largest single investor in ING, just ahead of

The shares closed yesterday at Fl 77.90, up Fl 0.80 as traders welcomed the
sale of shares that had been overhanging the market.
The state's stake of just under 7 per cent is a legacy of its holding in the
Postbank which, through a series of mergers, is now part of ING.
The government had said that it would eventually reduce its stake but the
timing was never specified.
The disposal comes after a strong run-up in the value of ING shares over the
past year from their lows of Fl 42 in the autumn of 1992.
Other financial stocks like ABN-Amro Bank have also risen sharply in the
same period.

FT  09 OCT 93 / International Company News: Moody's may downgrade Turkish
debt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Republic of Turkey may have its credit rating lowered from investment to
sub-investment grade to reflect its deteriorating public finances.
Moody's, the international credit rating agency, announced yesterday that it
has placed Turkey's long-term credit rating under review for possible
downgrading. The decision has come at an awkward time for Turkey as it was
hoping to launch a Eurosterling bond issue next week.
Turkey currently has a Baa3 credit rating, the lowest investment grade
rating available from Moody's, which covers about Dollars 6.2bn of long-term
debt.
Moody's cited 'the steady deterioration of Turkey's public finances' as the
reason for putting the rating under review, adding that the consolidated
budget deficit in 1993 could exceed the 13.8 per cent of GDP reached in
1992, while inflation may be rising again.

FT  09 OCT 93 / International Company News: John Fairfax settles with Packer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN FAIRFAX, the Australian publishing group, has settled outstanding
obligations to Mr Kerry Packer's Consolidated Press (ConsPress) by
effectively allowing the Australian businessman to increase his interest in
Fairfax.
The cash obligations arose from a two-year-old deal, under which Mr Packer
agreed to withdraw from the Tourang consortium which successfully acquired
Fairfax for ADollars 1.4bn in late-1991. Mr Packer's withdrawal came after
the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal started an inquiry into whether his
role in the consortium breached laws limiting investment of TV proprietors
in newspapers.
Fairfax yesterday said that it would pay ConsPress ADollars 60m (USDollars
39m) 'in full and final satisfaction of all its obligations' under the 1991
termination and release deed. However, it added that Nine Network, one of Mr
Packer's publicly-quoted companies, had separately agreed to subscribe for
20m shares in Fairfax, at a cash price of Dollars 3 apiece.
From Fairfax's viewpoint, the arrangement means that there will be no net
cash outlay. Nine Network, meanwhile, claimed to be showing a paper profit
of around ADollars 51m on its interest in Fairfax. The newly-acquired 20m
shares bought its total stake in Fairfax to 52.89m shares - or about 7.7 per
cent of the equity - and the average buy-in price was said to be ADollars
2.07. Fairfax shares closed unchanged at Dollars 3.04 last night.
In addition to Nine Network's interest in Fairfax, some further shares are
held by ConsPress. The total Packer interest in Fairfax, therefore, has
risen from around 10.5 per cent to about 13 per cent.

FT  09 OCT 93 / International Company News: BNP expects to attract 1.3m
private shareholders
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANQUE Nationale de Paris, the first candidate in the French government's
privatisation programme, yesterday estimated that it would attract between
1.3m and 1.4m private shareholders.
Mr Pebereau, the chairman, earlier yesterday said that the final number of
private investors should be 'considerably' higher than the 1m goal by the
time the public part of the BNP share sale closes next Tuesday.
The economy ministry this week announced that it was closing the
institutional part of the issue because it was already more than 12 times
subscribed after only two days. The BNP offer price at FFr240 (Dollars 42m)
was lower than analysts had expected, thereby triggering a flood of
applications.
However, the government is also anxious to encourage the French public to
invest in BNP. This is partly because it hopes the BNP issue will set a
successful precedent for future sales and partly because the Balladur
administration hopes to use the privatisations to boost individual share
ownership in France, where the public has traditionally been ambivalent
about equity investment.
Under the original offer terms the public will be entitled to 37.5m shares
in BNP, or 52 per cent of the 72m shares on sale, with 12.5m shares reserved
for French institutions and 23.5m for foreign institutions. The government
also has an option to clawback 9.5m extra shares for the public from the
institutional tranche.
The government initially intended to allocate 40 shares to each individual
investor, with an additional 40 for people converting their Balladur bonds
intro shares. However, Mr Pebereau said the public response had been so
strong that, even with the clawback, the number of shares given to
individuals might have to be reduced.

AKER, the Norwegian cement and offshore technology group, announced a 42.5
per cent jump in profits after financial items to NKr526m (Dollars 74m) for
the first eight months, against
NKr369m in the same period last year.
This term's figure was flattered by a NKr702m exceptional gain stemming
mainly from the sale of the group's stake in Valenciana, the Spanish cement
producer.
The group said results for the full year would be 'considerably better' than
the NKr368m profit of last year.
Operating revenues in the first eight months were NKr11.86bn, compared with
NKr11.49bn. The group swung to an operating profit of NKr518m from a NKr93m
loss and it cut its financial expenses by NKr159m to NKr89m.
Cement and building materials saw sales slip to NKr3.92bn from NKr3.96bn,
but the division made a profit after financial items of NKr191m, after a
NKr53m loss.
Oil and gas technology was also back in profit, with a NKr343m surplus
compared with a NKr193m loss.

battle

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMPLEX takeover battle for Paramount Communications, the film and
entertainment company, grew even more convoluted yesterday when
Tele-Communications Inc, the largest cable service company in the US,
announced plans to re-merge with Liberty Media, a company it spun off two
years ago.
Liberty, which provides programming for the cable industry, is a large
shareholder in QVC Network, the television home shopping company which is
making a hostile Dollars 9.5bn bid for Paramount.
Liberty is making a new Dollars 500m investment in QVC to help it fund the
Paramount bid, which is competing against an agreed offer from Viacom, a
cable service and programming company, worth around Dollars 7.5bn.
Reacquiring Liberty would bring TCI much more closely into the battle for
Paramount. This could reassure Wall Street that QVC, a much smaller company
than Paramount, has the financial strength to wage what promises to be a
long and costly battle, with both sides trying to attract support from other
large communications companies.
TCI spun off Liberty in 1991 to comply with federal regulations limiting
concentration in the cable television and programming industries, but the
rules have turned out to be less stringent than the sector expected.
Links between the two companies have remained strong. TCI holds a 5 per cent
stake in Liberty and TCI's chief executive, Mr John Malone, is chief
executive of Liberty and its controlling shareholder.
The two groups said yesterday their boards had approved a combination in
principle because it was difficult to monitor regulatory compliance as
separate operations.
Viacom said this would have no effect on its plans to take over Paramount
but added that the Liberty deal underscored the concerns it raised in a
lawsuit against TCI, accusing Mr Malone of trying to monopolise the cable
industry.
TCI said the proposed deal with Liberty would be structured as a tax-free
exchange of Class A and B shares of both companies for like shares in a
holding company yet to be formed. Its shareholders would receive one share
of the new company for each of their shares, while Liberty holders would
receive 0.975 of a new share for each of their shares.

(USDollars 866m) for the year to June 1993, up from HKDollars 4.68bn in
1992.
Profits were slightly above analysts' expectations, and were posted on
turnover of HKDollars 13.5bn, up from HKDollars 10.7bn in 1992. Second-half
earnings were boosted by the sale of the Kodak House building.
The outlook for earnings remains positive, despite recent moves by a number
of banks to curb property speculation through restrictive lending practices.
The majority of developments scheduled for completion in 1994 have already
been pre-sold and during the year the group acquired 18 more sites, with a
gross floor area of 6.3m sq ft.
Mr Walter Kwok, Sun Hung Kai's chairman, said: 'Persistent high inflation,
real increases in household income and low interest rates have made property
prices still acceptable to Hong Kong people. The fundamental factors
supporting the property market remain favourable.'
The directors recommended a final dividend of 95 cents a share, representing
a full-year payout of HKDollars 1.40 a share, up from HKDollars 1.14 in
1992.

FT  09 OCT 93 / International Company News: IRI sells SME division to FSVI
for L307bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IRI, the Italian state holding, has completed the second stage in the
privatisation of SME, its agro-industrial group, by selling its canned
foods, milk and edible oils division, Cirio-Bertolli-De Rica (Cbd), for
L307bn (Dollars 192m).
The 62 per cent stake held by IRI has been bought by FSVI, an
agro-industrial holding company with extensive interests in southern Italy
where SME has been strongly rooted.
FSVI is 60 per cent owned by co-operatives in the Basilicata region, a
further 20 per cent by regional financial institutions led by the
state-owned Banco di Napoli and the remainder split between private
shareholders.
IRI had hoped to sell this division in July in tandem with the disposal of
Finitalgel, the frozen foods side of SME. However, the IRI board judged the
offers insufficient. Since then there have been delicate negotiations
brokered by US merchant bankers Wasserstein Perella. The Cbd sale brings
earnings from disposal of the two SME divisions to L475bn.
The FSVI bid values Cbd shares at L1,102 each against a stock market
quotation of L1,146 and an initial estimate of L1,370. In adjudicating the
division to FSVI, IRI had to balance the strong pressure in the Naples area
and southern Italy for Cbd to be in local hands against the claims of larger
Italian and multinational groups.
Canned fruit, milk and tomatoes produced on co-operatives in Basilicata,
Calabria, Campana and Puglia are important to the regional economies in
terms of jobs and income.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the markets): Inco
comes to aid of nickel market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH PRICES falling by about 45 per cent over the past two years as
production ran ahead of flagging demand, the nickel market had become the
undisputed Cinderella of the London Metal Exchange. But a timely injection
of confidence by Inco, the biggest producer, has ensured that it will
present a less tattered appearance than might have been expected during LME
Week, the exchange's annual shindig, which begins on Monday.
Thursday night's announcement by the Canadian company of a plan to cut
production next year by 16 per cent, or about 5 per cent of western world
output, confirmed rumours that had already helped to lift the market by 10
per cent from the 6 3/4 -year lows reached a week ago.
Yesterday, with most of the bullish speculators resisting the temptation to
cash in their chips, the three months delivery price put on another Dollars
75 to close at Dollars 4,562.50 a tonne, up Dollars 450 on the week.
'The producers had to do something,' said Nick Moore, analyst at Ord
Minnett, as there was no chance that next year's expected increase in nickel
demand would amount to the 22 per cent needed bring the market back into
balance.
'This is a good start,' he said yesterday, referring to the Inco move, 'but
other companies will have to follow'. It would not have been reasonable, he
suggested, to have expected a much bigger cut from Inco because 'if they had
put up too big an umbrella others might have sheltered under it'.
He calculated that output cuts of some 45,000 tonnes a year would have to be
made before consumption started eating into excess stocks, which he
estimated to be equivalent to 18 week's western world consumption. Inco's
move would account for about 60 per cent of that, Mr Moore said, and he was
confident that other companies would make inroads into the remainder.
Falconbridge, also of Canada and the second-biggest producer, was the
obvious candidate. A six-month closure of its Falcondo operation in the in
the Dominican republic would take another 16,000 tonnes out of the market,
Mr Moore said. A further 17,000 tonnes might be removed if Sunday's election
resulted in a new Greek government and an end to the series of reprieves
that had kept the country's loss-making Larco company in operation, he said.
Larco is the world's highest-cost nickel producer.
Another possibility was that some Japanese ferro-nickel producers might
succumb to financial pressures caused by the strength of the yen, which had
made nickel production even more unremunerative for them.
That is not to say that it is remunerative elsewhere. 'No western producer
is making money at these levels,' said Mr Wiktor Bielski, analyst at Bain
and Company, before the Inco announcement.
Inco itself lost Dollars 2.2m in the second quarter of this year, when the
nickel price averaged Dollars 2.93 a lb - 86 cents higher than it is now,
even after this week's rally.
Nickel's strength this week helped sentiment in the tin market, recently
nickel's partner at the tail end of the LME batting order. With the rise
being aided by short-covering purchases and a strike at Brazil's biggest
producer the three-months price ended the week Dollars 285 higher at Dollars
4,722.50 a tonnes.
The zinc market flirted early in the week with the Dollars 920-a-tonne mark,
for three-months metal. But that speculative surge soon ran out of steam and
the price ended at Dollars 904.50 a tonne, up Dollars 9 on balance.
In contrast, lead prices bounced from fresh 20-year lows as signs of
consumer interest emerged. The rise, which was also fuelled by options
activity, took the three-months price to Dollars 384.50 at yesterday's
close, up Dollars 9 on the week.
At the London bullion market gold and platinum were outshone by silver,
which ended 26 cents up on the week at 432,50 a troy ounce for immediate
delivery. Dealers attributed the rise to speculative buying encouraged by
the present supply deficit, despite the large US stockpile overhanging the
market.
Among the soft commodities, it was cocoa's turn for a 'correction' following
a rise to long time highs. On Monday the December futures contract reached
Pounds 983 a tonne, the highest level seen since May 1990. But the bulls'
appeared to quail at the sight of the Pounds 1,000 barrier and after another
abortive attempt on Tuesday to break upside resistance the rot set in.
In what analyst Lawrence Eagles of GNI, the London trade house, described as
'blood-bath' the December price floundered to Pounds 911 before steadying
yesterday to Pounds 913 a tonne, down Pounds 56 on the week.
Mr Eagles suggested that the final push to Pounds 983 had been fuelled by
'the last of the bulls', and when there was no follow through the selling
began in earnest.
Most traders still regard the cocoa market's long term prospects as bullish.
But many believe the current retracement could take the price as low as
Pounds 850 a tonne, and some Pounds 830, if March position support at Pounds
892 a tonne gives way.
The coffee market, which had already had its correction, following a
sustained run-up, put in a steadier performance. The January futures price
ended yesterday at Dollars 1,179 a tonne, up Dollars 7 on the week.
Traders told the Reuter news agency that the coffee market was still in the
process of deciding which way to move next.

The pre-tax figure for the year to May 31 fell from Pounds 502,000 to Pounds

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ADT's share price fell by 44p yesterday to close at 579p following
speculation that ADT's largest shareholder, Ontario-based Laidlaw, might
sell its 24 per cent stake in the Bermuda-based security services and
vehicle auction group.
The speculation followed news that Mr Donald Jackson, Laidlaw's chief
executive, will submit his resignation at a board meeting on October 13
following 'differences of opinion concerning Laidlaw's strategic direction'.
Earlier this year Mr Jackson described Laidlaw's stake in ADT, which was
acquired under his predecessor Mr Michael DeGroote, as a 'portfolio
investment'.
In July Laidlaw decided not take up its proportionate share of ADT's public
offer in the US of 18m shares at Dollars 8 each. The Dollars 144m proceeds
were used help ADT refinance Dollars 1.3bn of debt and meet preference share
obligations. As a result of the public offer Laidlaw's stake fell from 28.4
to its current level.
ADT declined to comment on the share price movement yesterday.

FT  09 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Bonds undermine foundations - Greycoat's
future after the PosTel rejection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRONICLERS of the demise of Greycoat, one of UK's most adventurous 1980s
property companies, will have to wait a while longer before bringing their
final chapter to a close.
Yesterday, the Pounds 121m rescue bid put together by PosTel, the UK's
largest pension fund, failed to receive adequate support from two classes of
bond and shareholders.
But one way or the other, Greycoat's days seem numbered.
From the moment PosTel published its complex offer document in July, the
company was in breach of covenants restricting gearing. If the board's dire
warnings to shareholders ahead of yesterday's vote are to be believed, this
means Greycoat could be facing the imminent arrival of the liquidators.
Such an event would be an ignominious ending for one of the most exciting of
the 1980s property developers. Its main developments at 123 Buckingham
Palace Road, Britannic House, and Embankment Place, the imposing office
building above London's Charing Cross railway station, have been received
with the highest critical acclaim from architects and property investors.
Where Greycoat suffered, along with Stanhope and Rosehaugh two other 1980s
developers that have already gone under, was from the severity of the slump
in commercial property.
Had property values recovered earlier, Greycoat could have been able to meet
the looming demands that have brought the company to the brink. Without that
recovery in values, survival has proved impossible.
It was the financing of Embankment Place that was the immediate cause of
Greycoat's problems. To meet the Pounds 160m capital cost, Greycoat was
forced to top up borrowings with a Pounds 21m bond on which it paid no
coupon. The bondholders expected to be repaid Pounds 50m in 1995, which
would have been possible had the property slump not persisted so long.
Then there is Britannic House, the prestigious building which houses BP and
the asset best suited for institutional investors now seeking to rebuild
property portfolios. Again Greycoat deferred some of the pain by paying a
low initial coupon, which is now about to double.
Realistically, the company has no chance of meeting these commitments. As Mr
Geoffrey Wilson, Greycoat's chairman, said yesterday, the company remains in
default after yesterday's rejection of the PosTel deal.
However liquidation may not be inevitable. Even if it does come to that it
may not be as bleak as Greycoat has claimed in the run-up to the votes.
As Greycoat's directors licked their wounds, presumably with NM Rothschild,
their advisers, who it was revealed yesterday were on a substantial success
related fee, speculation rose that another bidder might now show its hand.
Throughout PosTel's protracted offer period no other buyers emerged. It is
possible they did not want to take on such a large institution.
In addition, if some property analysts and the dissenting Greycoat
preference shareholders are to be believed, the company's value may have
risen since it was correctly valued by PosTel when it first proposed the
deal six months ago.
Mr John Katz, a vociferous critic of the deal and a preference shareholder,
has strongly questioned the valuation of properties which are at present
occupied by tenants enjoying rent free holidays.
This has become a common incentive during the property slump but it clearly
has reduced the value of the properties, he says. In a couple of years there
would be a considerable increase in the cash flow from these properties,
making them very attractive to long-term investors.
Whether this view of valuations proves correct is for the market to decide.
One way or another, either through another bid or the services of a
liquidator, the hypothesis on which the bond and preference shareholders
based their rejection of the PosTel offer will be tested very soon.

FT  09 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Hi-Tec sprints back to Pounds 0.78m profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HI-TEC, the sports and leisure wear company 54 per cent owned by its founder
Mr Frank van Wezel, returned to the black in the six months to July 31, with
pre-tax profits of Pounds 776,000 against losses of Pounds 2.8m.
Strong growth in the US helped the company record a 29 per cent increase in
sales to Pounds 59.4m.
Mr Peter Butler, finance director, said the profits improvement stemmed
largely from the decision to close the European subsidiaries built up last
year, thus eliminating annual losses of about Pounds 7.5m and fixed costs of
some Pounds 3m.
Mr Butler said the European footwear operation, which now relied on
distributors to sell the Hi-Tec product, had broken even in the first half.
However, the leisure wear division, Bad Boys, had incurred higher losses,
leaving Hi-Tec with a Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 1.4m) deficit in continental
Europe.
In the US Hi-tec benefited from a trend away from white sports shoes towards
light weight boots in earthy colours.
The group, which claims 10 per cent of the Dollars 600m (Pounds 397m) light
weight outdoor footwear market in the US, 'is really roaring away' Mr Butler
said. Including currency gains, sales in the US doubled to Pounds 23.6m with
profits jumping from Pounds 636,000 to Pounds 2.1m.
Hi-Tec also boasted a better year in the UK because of the demise of the
price war in the sports shoe market and a reduction in staff, stocks and
debtors. 'As a result we have been able to get back a huge chunk of the
margin we lost last year,' Mr Butler said.
The UK and Irish division, which sells both sports shoes and the hiking
boot, had returned a small profit of Pounds 793,000, against a loss of
Pounds 861,000, on flat sales of Pounds 19.9m (Pounds 19.6m).
The dividend was increased by 25 per cent to 1.25p. Earnings per share were
1.4p against losses of 4.86p.
COMMENT
The shares rose 4p to 64p following one of the most optimistic statements
this group has made for some time. Yet this does not mean there is a queue
of people waiting to buy into this tightly controlled company. Gearing
remains at an uncomfortable 100 per cent plus, which almost certainly means
an equity issue to raise cash for the rapidly growing US side. Then there
are the nagging doubts following Hi-Tec's sudden tumble into loss last year
and the sudden resignations of two powerful non-executive directors in March
after just eight weeks in the job. These anxieties are unlikely to be
dispelled until the final results at the earliest, leaving little upside in
the immediate future. Forecasts are for pre-tax profits of at least Pounds
2.5m, leaving a prospective p/e of about 15 times.

FT  09 OCT 93 / UK Company News: ASH shares fall 23% on profits warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Automated Sec-urity (Holdings), the international electronic
security systems company, plunged by nearly 23 per cent after the group
issued a profits warning yesterday.
In a related development, de Zoete &amp; Bevan, ASH's joint stockbroker for 10
years, resigned in a row over the group's enhanced scrip dividend. ASH had
rejected its advice that it should revise the terms of the dividend after
the profits warning.
The share price fall was initially much steeper because of a mistake in the
Stock Exchange announcement at 11.44am. Losses against discontinued
operations were shown as Pounds 32m instead of Pounds 2m.
Before a correction was announced at 12.05pm, the shares hit a low of 90p.
They recovered to close at 102p, down 30p from Thursday's close.
The group warned that its pre-tax profit for the nine months to September
30, which will be announced next week, would be Pounds 9m after charging
losses for discontinued operations of about Pounds 2m and an additional
Pounds 1m for further reorganisation costs. The results for the full year
would be 'significantly below market expectations,' it said.
One analyst said: 'The company has a history of disappointing, and a history
of poor share price performance in front of disappointment. I've pretty much
washed my hands of it'.
Mr Tom Buffet, chairman, said the market had been expecting full-year
pre-tax profits of Pounds 17m to Pounds 18m. In July the group reported
interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.13m on turnover from continuing
operations of Pounds 74.3m.
Mr Buffet said the Pounds 2m reflected the cost of closing the fire systems
division whose main business is contract fire alarms. The Pounds 1m costs
were incurred in finalising the reorganisation.
He described California, where one of the group's main businesses is based,
as 'a very deeply hit market.'
In late afternoon, the group issued a further trading statement noting that
'the market for alarm verification systems continues to develop.' The group,
which claims to be a world leader in this sector through its TVX and
Sonitrol technology, cited an announcement from the Los Angeles Police
Department that 'verified alarms such as those provided by ASH will receive
higher priority than normal unverified alarm systems.'
Mr Buffet said earlier that 60 per cent of the group's shareholders were
based in the US.

FT  09 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Broker resigns in row over enhanced scrip
dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORTY MINUTES after Aut-omated Security (Holdings)'s profit warning appeared
on Stock Exchange screens yesterday, de Zoete &amp; Bevan announced its
resignation as its joint broker. The swiftness of the broker's announcement
suggests a fierce row had blown up between it and the company.
The argument is over the company's enhanced scrip dividend, announced in
July. De Zoete, part of Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the integrated securities
house, said that it had advised ASH to cancel the share issue, which comes
into effect on Wednesday next week, because of the sharp fall in the share
price yesterday to 102p.
It said it resigned when ASH refused to take its advice within the timescale
it set. ASH said yesterday that the scrip dividend remained in place, but
would be kept under review and a decision whether to proceed with it would
be taken by next Tuesday on the basis of what is best for the company and
its shareholders.
The scrip issue is still conditional on the new shares being admitted to the
Official List. This is usually a formality, but the Stock Exchange could in
theory refuse their admission if it found grounds to do so. It is also
expected to look at the company's share price movements ahead of the
warning.
Under the enhanced scrip shareholders were offered either a cash interim
dividend of 3.05p or a 50 per cent higher dividend in shares, worth 4.58p.
The scrip dividend was approved by shareholders at a special meeting on
September 29, and 87.5 per cent of shareholders elected to take the shares
instead of the cash dividend. This would save the company Pounds 3.1m in
cash and Pounds 900,000 in advance corporation tax which is not payable on
scrip dividends.
On Tuesday this week the reference price for the scrip - the price used to
calculate how many shares would be issued to meet the dividend payment - was
set at 142p. Shareholders who took the scrip dividend are in effect buying
new shares next Wednesday at 142p, 40p above the current market price.
Shareholders with 24.3 per cent of ASH's shares decided to accept the scrip
dividend but take advantage of BZW's offer to buy and place their new
shares. The price set for this placing of 892,000 shares was 136p. Investors
who bought those shares are now nursing heavy losses.
It is thought that BZW itself may have been left with some of these shares,
which might explain its anger. Furthermore, BZW dreamt up the enhanced scrip
dividend idea and has arranged them for 14 clients. It therefore has an
interest in maintaining the integrity of the product.

FT  09 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Chairman threatened by Tiphook price fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER and RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER sharp fall in the share price of Tiphook yesterday made the position
of Mr Robert Montague, founder and executive chairman of the container
leasing and transport rental group, look increasingly precarious.
The UK company's shares dropped by another 46p to 123p, a 27 per cent fall.
They had already fallen nearly 30 per cent on Thursday after the loss-making
group warned that it would breach its banking covenants.
Tiphook is trying to negotiate new facilities with its bankers. The
continuing pressure on its share price makes it more likely that the lenders
will distance themselves from Mr Montague, who has been criticised for his
buccaneering style and high salary.
Mr Montague is, however, acknowledged to have a deep knowledge of the
business and may continue in a diminished role. Shareholders could also
insist on his departure or demotion, as they must approve new borrowing
limits at an extraordinary general meeting. The group's gearing will soon
breach 500 per cent, the ceiling allowed by its articles of association.
The fall-out from Tiphook's financial difficulties will be felt particularly
acutely in the US, where bid speculation and the size of the dividend yield
had led to a strong following for the company's stock. More than half the
shares are currently held in the form of American Depositary Receipts: these
had shed Dollars 1/4 at Dollars 6 by midday yesterday.
One US investment analyst said it was 'almost a given' that investors would
launch legal action against Tiphook, claiming to have been misled by
over-confident assertions about the company's prospects.
Mr Andrew Silver, an analysts at investment bank Dillon Read, said Tiphook
had on several occasions made statements about its outlook that had proved
too optimistic.

FT  09 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Welsh Water plan to lease off hotels fails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WELSH WATER's plan to extricate itself from the hotel business by signing a
15-year lease for four of its properties with Resort Hotels, and signing a
management contract with Resort for a fifth, collapsed yesterday.
Following the announcement its shares closed 10p down at 635p.
In a terse one paragraph joint statement issued to the Stock Exchange, Welsh
Water and Resort Hotels announced that they had decided 'not to proceed with
the disposal'.
Welsh Water, which revealed the plan in July at the same time as its interim
results, says it will be 'taking steps to find a new partner and remains
committed to its decision to exit from hotel management.'
The day after Welsh Water announced the deal Resort's shares were suspended,
Mr Robert Feld, managing director and head of the family which built the
group, resigned, and the board said in a statement that it was concerned
'over a number of financing and reporting issues'.
Resort's shares remain suspended at 45p. Late yesterday afternoon Welsh
Water's management was unavailable for comment and Resort Hotels declined to
elaborate on the Stock Exchange announcement.

FT  09 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Radamec at Pounds 335,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RADAMEC Group, electronics and precision mechanical engineering concern,
reported pre-tax profits down from Pounds 365,000 to Pounds 335,000 in the
first half of 1993.
This was achieved on a greater turnover of Pounds 6m (Pounds 5.8m). However
the company said the return on sales had been diluted as the result of a
large amount of low margin business.
The result, which followed a recovery from Pounds 345,000 to Pounds 832,000
in 1992, left the share price 8p lower at 58p.
Mr Leonard Whittaker, chairman, said that the interim result was indicative
of the slower recovery from recession in the group's markets.
The interim dividend is unchanged at 0.5p payable from earnings per share of
1.8p (2p).

FT  09 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Graystone in agreed bid for Brit Syphon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRAYSTONE, the engineering company formed out of Ptarmigan Holdings, the
flowers and hotels group, yesterday launched its second large paper-backed
acquisition in little more than five months.
It is buying British Syphon Industries in a recommended cash and shares
offer which values the engineering, packaging and motor components company
at Pounds 32.8m.
For every 100 Syphon shares Graystone is offering Pounds 76.3 cash, 34
ordinary shares and 28 19.2 per cent cumulative preference shares.
Graystone is raising Pounds 18.4m through a 7-for-4 rights issue of up to
167.4m shares at 11p each to help pay for the cash element. It is
underwritten by Chemical Investment Bank. The brokers are Henry Cooke
Lumsden.
Graystone shares closed  1/2 p lower at 10p while British Syphon fell 12p to
83p. At the closing price the offer values Syphon shares at 96.5p.
British Syphon brings with it about Pounds 8m in cash.
The enlarged group would have turnover of roughly Pounds 60m in three
distinct legs, mechanical products with some design features, electrical
products and packaging and distribution.
British Syphon has two main shareholders. Both have agreed to accept the
offer. Britannia, a subsidiary of Bankers Trust, holds 69.4 per cent, the
legacy of an attempt by management to take the company private, and
companies connected with Mr Nathu Ram Puri, who foiled the privatisation,
which hold 23 per cent.
In May Graystone bought Cableform from FKI for Pounds 8m, funding the deal
by a 14-for-3 rights issue priced at 8p each.
In November it bought three engineering companies from Prospect Industries,
a company which Mr Dick Richardson, Graystone's chairman and chief
executive, originally floated off from Tace, the environmental controls
company. He was managing director of Tace until 1991 when he resigned
following a boardroom row.
Mr Richardson, who joined Graystone in June last year, said: 'The
engineering business is quite a good fit. They are already customers of ours
as well as competitors. They also have distribution companies within them
which gives us access to new markets.'
Graystone hopes to pay both interim and final dividends for the year ended
June 30 1994.

FT  09 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Quadramatic buys Quota companies for Pounds
11.25m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QUADRAMATIC, the coin-handling and optical group which came to the market in
July, has moved swiftly to fulfil its promise to build a specialist
engineering group by acquisition.
The Oldham-based group is paying Pounds 11.25m for Quota, a private holding
company for two high-technology businesses. Datapaq, based in Cambridge,
supplies thermal monitoring systems. Automatic System Laboratories, a Milton
Keynes company makes calibrating equipment for laboratories.
The consideration is to be satisfied by raising Pounds 10.25m through a
placing and open offer of 7m new shares at 145p per share and the issue of
689,800 shares to the vendors.
Some 2.2m of the new shares have been placed firm with the remainder being
offered to existing shareholders on a 1-for-4.18 basis.
Quadramatic was floated at 123p, valuing the group at Pounds 36.4m. The
shares yesterday closed 6p higher at 155p.
Mr Tony Gartland, Quadramatic's chairman, said the businesses fulfilled the
acquisition criteria he identified at the time of the flotation - that they
should be earnings-enhancing, have quality products with good gross margins
and growth potential.
Datapaq, which also has a US operation in Massachusetts, reported turnover
of Pounds 4.5m in the year to June 30 for operating profits of Pounds 1.3m.
ASL had sales of Pounds 2.7m in the 15 months to June 30 and made an
operating profit of Pounds 113,000.
Mr Gartland said his group would keep the existing management and workforce
of both companies. However the vendors, Mr Stephen Black and Mr Ian
Williams, will play no further role in the company.
He believed Datapaq's expertise could be extended into monitoring pressure
and humidity, while ASL's products could be broadened out from the
laboratory level to the much bigger industrial market.
Quadramatic expects pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.59m and earnings of 9.8p.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Membership up at reform club: Russia's economic prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new wave of economic reform is being planned in Russia. The violent
clearing of the ground between President Boris Yeltsin and the Russian
parliament which has just been witnessed has - an early judgment would
suggest - changed the atmosphere, at least for a while. Conscious that they
are working in the shadow of a bloodily suppressed revolt, the reformers are
nevertheless determined to take advantage of it to initiate change which has
so far eluded them.
Both Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy prime minister for finance, and Mr Sergei
Vassiliev, head of the government's economic reform centre, agree on this:
that the spectacle of tanks battering the White House parliament building
produced a sudden spasm of acquiescence among institutions, regional
councils and individuals that had previously been more or less strongly
opposed to central power.
Mr Fyodorov, his big-cat smile a little broader, says that, when formerly
difficult regional and republican leaders come to see him in his ministry
now, 'we have very pleasant conversations'. Mr Vassiliev, working on new
plans in the quiet seclusion of the Volynskoye government estate in the
Moscow suburbs, says: 'Of course we are all shocked. But for ordinary people
it is not at all a bad thing to have a strong man in the Kremlin.'
What will the two men do in the period until parliamentary elections, set
for December 12? In the short run, not much. Mr Fyodorov says: 'My aim is to
get through this period with honour' - by which he means that he will
constrain the budget within harsh limits and try to stop his colleagues from
making too many expensive promises. He intends to cut the budget deficit for
the fourth quarter from an estimated Rbs12,700bn to Rbs4,600bn. Now that Mr
Yegor Gaidar has been reappointed first deputy premier for the economy, Mr
Fyodorov says, his job is much easier, because he no longer gets demands for
increased spending from the economics ministry - 'instead they put in an
estimate of the deficit even lower than mine, at under Rbs4,000bn - but you
must be realistic'.
Mr Vassiliev says that some liberalisation of prices - in energy and grain -
with an opening up of foreign trade, will be possible before the elections.
There will also be incentives for house construction and the strengthening
of private property rights, as well as 'post-privatisation measures'
designed to help managers restructure enterprises and run them more
efficiently. This, however, does not tackle the central problems.
First, there is the delayed matter of financial stabilisation - a process
still being planned, on the assumption that the government returned after
the elections will be a radical one. Mr Vassiliev believes that the
liberal-conservative electoral bloc, Russia's Choice, which Mr Gaidar put
together in his months out of government, will do well. 'It is very
necessary that we should have a coherent and united government: we don't
have it now.'
He, with others in the government, believes that the International Monetary
Fund must work more closely with the planners on the stabilisation programme
than they have. 'They must recognise that the ministries have different
demands, and must work with them to find out what laws are needed to
implement the programme.' The various packages the IMF has supported in the
past have included a fund of at least Dollars 6bn to back the stabilisation
of the rouble: the probable aim of the reformers will be to achieve this
early next year, perhaps as early as January.
The second large area, on which Mr Fyodorov is working, is to develop a
fiscal system that allows the regions and the republics to exercise some
real financial autonomy - but that at the same time gives the centre
authority. To say that the centre and the regions are at each other's
throats on control of resources is an oversimplified picture, based on a few
republics' refusal to pay taxes, such as the diamond-rich Sakha (formerly
Yakutia), and provinces such as the oil-producing Tyumen. Mr Fyodorov says:
'The problem of withholding taxes was exaggerated: when we examined it
closely here, it did not seem so bad - they (the regions) remit most of
their taxes.'
In an average region like Perm in the Urals, with heavy industry, some
mineral wealth, and 30 per cent of its working population on the land, there
is a recognition that they must work within a rational framework. Mr Viktor
Gorbunov, in charge of privatisation in the region, says he cannot get real
improvements in the performance of privatised enterprises when inflation is
so high - more than 20 per cent in September - and ineffective anti-monopoly
legislation fails to promote competition. Above all, he says, 'financial
policy cannot be decided by the regions'.
Mr Fyodorov wants the regions, like federal Lander in Germany and states in
the US, to have control of some tax revenue, under ceilings established by
government. He must also tackle the critical, but touchy, matter of
redistribution - trying to avoid a free-for-all in which the one-third of
regions and republics that are rich get richer, leaving the middle one-third
to stagnate, and the one-third cursed with obsolescent industries and/or
inefficient agriculture to decline further.
'The value added tax will be the basic mechanism for redistribution,' says
Mr Fyodorov. 'We want a single rate to apply all over the country - now the
situation is that there are different rates for different regions.
'But we in the centre must stop the system where we intervene everywhere . .
. In general, people in the regions like the notion of having some fiscal
autonomy: they don't quite know what it means but they like it.'
Mr Vassiliev says that when, after the collapse of the old centralised
system, it became obvious which parts of the country were 'profitable' and
which were not, 'you have a huge problem - how to convince the rich to help
the poor. The system must be transparent: perhaps we need a Council for
Mutual Economic Assistance (an ironic reference to the Comecon, the former
common market for communist states) which really will render mutual
assistance.'
The political framework will determine everything. The present government
remains split - with market reformers like Mr Gaidar and Mr Fyodorov
uneasily coexisting with relative conservatives like Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin,
the prime minister. While Mr Fyodorov struggles to be rid of Mr Viktor
Gerashchenko, chairman of the central bank, Mr Chernomyrdin protects him.
Reform under such conditions is possible only in small steps. Says Mr
Fyodorov: 'The central bank never says no directly: but it delays, and it
does not take the measures it should take without being told to.'
The elections should make matters clear in two ways. First it will show the
inclinations of the new business groups, which will emerge as the main
backers of parties and individuals. Mr Vassiliev says the struggle will be
between business groups linked to organised crime groups, with an interest
in preserving instability, and others seeking a rational and transparent
economy.
Second, it will test the will of the country. For while the elections will
be chaotic, they will offer candidates that have been identified at federal
or regional level with one or other version of reform - or with none. For
all the reformers' optimism, the voting intentions of an electorate at once
wearied, hard-pressed and volatile cannot be known or even properly
estimated.

Sir, I cannot help wondering whether there is a conspiracy of silence among
those building societies which have issued permanent interest bearing shares
(PIBS). Twelve societies have now issued PIBS and the current, aggregate
market value of such issues is in excess of Pounds 1bn.
To my amazement, not one of the societies has seen fit to have its PIBS
prices quoted daily in your columns. I enquired of two societies why they
were not advertising their prices in your paper. One appeared to regard the
idea as a somewhat quaint notion; the other said I was only the second
person to ask the question.
Cannot these building societies be persuaded to abandon their excessive
modesty? S W Duggan,

FT  09 OCT 93 / High on hype: Ethical questions raised by the
personality-changing drug Prozac
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When a drug becomes the butt of a joke in a Woody Allen film, its
manufacturers can be reasonably assured that it has become part of a
national culture.
Prozac's mention in Allen's latest comedy, Manhattan Murder Mystery,
confirms its status as the most successful psychiatric medicine in the US,
overtaking Valium both in terms of the value of sales and as the drug the
film world turns to as a symbol of the times.
The spread of the small off-white and green capsules has been debated on
prime-time US television shows. Now a book about the impact of the drug on
patients' personalities, Listening to Prozac by Dr Peter Kramer, a
psychiatrist at Brown University, Rhode Island, has made it on to the New
York Times's list of the top 15 non-fiction titles.
The drug's growth has been rapid. Only two years after its launch in 1987 by
Eli Lilly, the US pharmaceuticals group, doctors were writing 650,000 new
prescriptions a month for Prozac - a rate of growth from launch that drug
companies rarely achieve. To date, nearly 4.5m Americans have taken the drug
at some time. Elsewhere in the world, another 4m have used it. Global sales
totalled Dollars 1.1bn last year, making it Eli Lilly's biggest selling
product. Prozac was launched in the UK in January 1989, available on
prescription, and sales are believed to be growing rapidly although no
figures have been released.
Prozac's success is based not just on its efficacy as an anti-depressant; it
is regarded by the medical profession as no more effective than previous
generations of such drugs. Nor is it due entirely to its safety record,
which is significantly better than its predecessors: allegations by the US
Church of Scientology that Prozac was encouraging suicidal tendencies among
users were rejected last year by the US Food and Drug Administration.
Prozac's popularity with patients, and the resulting pressure on doctors to
prescribe it, is based above all on its apparent power to alter
personalities as well as cure depression.
Dr Kramer says in his book that the drug can, in a substantial minority of
patients, change personalities within a few weeks. It can boost social
confidence in the habitually timid, make the sensitive brash, and transform
the introverted into outgoing, loquacious people - rapidly achieving what
psychiatrists hope, and often fail, to accomplish by other methods over a
period of years. It can even, says Dr Kramer, improve business acumen.
The drug creates hyperthymia, a condition which makes people optimistic,
decisive, quick of thought, charismatic, energetic and confident. Dr Kramer
dubs the phenomenon 'cosmetic psychopharmacology'. If you can have plastic
surgery, or dye your hair blond, why not take this 'anti-wallflower
compound' to improve your temperament, he writes. 'Since you only live once,
why not live it as a blond? Why not a peppy blond?' asks Dr Kramer.
It sounds too good to be true. Prozac seems to have few immediate
side-effects and, as far as doctors know, is non-addictive. Unlike LSD or
alcohol, it boosts confidence and productivity without distorting
perception.
But critics believe the hype is overdone. Dr Joe Collier, consultant
clinical pharmacologist at St George's Hospital Medical School, London, said
clinical evidence showed that Prozac was no more effective than older,
cheaper anti-depressants. 'We've seen drugs hailed as 'transformers' before.
For example, when L-Dopa came out to treat Parkinson's Disease, people
claimed that it had all sorts of extra qualities - it was even seen as an
aphrodisiac,' he says.
'The idea that a drug can make you 'more normal than normal' worries me a
lot. Anything that makes you feel super-normal for a while may have serious
consequences in the end.'
Eli Lilly has deliberately not tried to exploit some of Dr Kramer's more
dramatic claims, pointing out they are not backed by scientific trials. The
company does not pretend that Prozac has miraculous qualities. Prozac is
only one of four drugs in the class known as selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors - chemicals that affect the process by which signals are
transmitted in the brain.
The others in the category are: Fluvoxamine, developed by Solvay of Belgium;
Lustral, known as Zoloft in North America where it is marketed by Pfizer;
and Seroxat, discovered by Novo Nordisk in Denmark and marketed in most
parts of the world by SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American healthcare
group. On medical criteria, other SSRIs may be more appropriate for
particular patients.
At the same time, no SSRI comes close to being a panacea. On average they
are effective for only about 70 per cent of patients. Prozac is no
exception.
Nevertheless, Prozac can prove a potent anti-depressant, as many in the US
have found. One mother of a depressed teenager who takes the drug says: 'The
amazing thing is that a kid who could not even hold a casual conversation,
would stay in her room and would become anxious just worrying about what to
have for dinner, now has a normal life. In a matter of months, she has
become socially confident, able to attend school and spend time with
friends. The change is phenomenal.'
The effects Prozac has on personalities raise ethical dilemmas. By affecting
the way the brain operates, Prozac and the other SSRIs go beyond curing what
doctors perceive as illnesses, to alter the kind of person a patient is.
Just as a surgeon can transform someone's appearance, Prozac changes
temperaments. Personalities become a collection of neurotransmitting
chemicals, subject to alteration.
Another dilemma is the question of whether doctors should prescribe Prozac
to healthy people who want to enhance their personalities, when teenagers
taking drugs such as ecstasy - which induces a near-instant feeling of
well-being - are frowned upon by governments.
The point at which a line should be drawn between acceptable and
non-acceptable use of drugs is hard to define; at some point, governments
might be tempted to prescribe the drug for criminals or those with
anti-social tendencies.
There is also the danger of over-prescription. Prozac's long-term effects
are unknown. Valium, for instance, was hailed as a cure for female
depression in the 1960s but was subsequently found to be addictive. Five
times as many women take Prozac as men.
Pharmaceutical research and development take many years and cost hundreds of
millions of dollars. Prozac and the other SSRIs are the product of
discoveries made 20 years ago. As the understanding of the brain's molecular
biology improves, so even more potent and selective mind-altering drugs will
become available. Solvay reckons there are more than 40 such
anti-depressants ready to be submitted to licensing authorities or in
development. The dilemmas posed by 'cosmetic psychopharmacology' will not
disappear.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Wham] A culture clash: George Michael's court fight with
Sony
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London High Court proceedings on competition law and restraint of trade do
not usually attract crowds of teenage girls. They are likely to turn up on
Monday, however, when hearings begin in the case of Georgios Panayiotou v
Sony Music Entertainment.
Mr Panayiotou is better known to his fans as singer George Michael. He is
asking the court to declare his contract with Sony void and unenforceable
because it represents an unreasonable restraint of trade and is contrary to
the Treaty of Rome's competition provisions.
If George Michael wins, he will turn the international music industry upside
down. Entertainment industry lawyers say many other disaffected performers
will demand the renegotiation of their contracts. Record companies say the
cost of producing music could escalate.
Whichever way the case goes, it could cast doubt on the ability of Japanese
electronics companies such as Sony to manage the creative talent in the
western music and film businesses they have bought in the past few years.
George Michael says his problems began when Sony bought CBS Records in 1988.
Before then, he says his years with CBS were creative and productive. When
Sony took over, the atmosphere changed.
He adds: 'I have seen the great American company that I proudly signed to as
a teenager become a small part of the production line for a giant
electronics corporation, which, frankly, has no understanding of the
creative process.
'With CBS, I felt I was believed in as a long-term artist, whereas Sony
appears to see artists as little more than software. Musicians do not come
in regimented shapes and sizes but are individuals who change and evolve
together with their audiences. Sony obviously views this as a great
inconvenience.'
George Michael alleges his contract with Sony is unfairly loaded against
him. The writ he has issued says Sony is entitled to receive eight albums
from him. He has so far delivered two: Faith, and Listen Without Prejudice,
Volume I. Given the time taken to record albums, the contract will probably
last until 2003. During that period, he is not entitled to record for any
other company.
Sony is entitled to ownership and copyright of George Michael's recordings.
He, however, has to bear the cost of making them.
Sony has undertaken in the contract to release between three and four
singles from each album George Michael delivers in the US and the UK. Sony
does not have to release singles in any other country.
The company is under no obligation to release any of George Michael's full
albums in any country. He can, however, under certain circumstances bring
the contract to an end if Sony does not release one of his albums in the UK.
In some other countries, he has the right to ask the company to find a
licensee to release albums, but the writ alleges this would be difficult to
do. Sony retains copyright over George Michael's recordings even if it does
not release them, the writ says.
The writ says that Sony's right to reject albums 'could result in a total
sterilisation of the artist's recorded output for a very lengthy period of
time, or even for the remainder of his professional career.'
The writ alleges the level of royalties paid to George Michael is
inequitable. It says the singer has not been able to quantify this exactly,
but his lawyers estimate that he received an average 57p an album for his
first two releases, while Sony received Pounds 1.83.
George Michael also alleges that Sony distributed about 9 per cent of his
first two albums free to UK wholesalers and retailers in lieu of price
discounts. This meant he received no royalties on these albums.
Sony declined to comment on the case.
A music industry lawyer who has negotiated contracts for recording companies
says there is nothing unusual about George Michael's contract. If anything,
he says, it is more generous than most, particularly in its royalty
provisions.
It is true, he says, that young artists, desperate to have their songs
recorded, sometimes conclude unfavourable contracts. 'When an artist starts
out, he will pay a record company to take him on,' he says. He adds,
however, that, while George Michael signed his original contract when he was
a relatively unknown member of the duo Wham, he has been able to renegotiate
it several times since he became successful.
Mr Martin Mills, managing director of music company Beggar's Banquet, says
that the industry will be less inclined to take a chance on young talent if
Sony loses and contracts become more strongly weighted in musicians' favour.
Money made from more successful acts is currently used to subsidise untried
performers, he says. If George Michael wins, he says, 'it would mean artists
would have to mortgage their houses to pay for their first recording,
instead of the company investing in them'.
Nevertheless, artists have in the past persuaded the courts to declare their
contracts void. In one case, the Court of Appeal in 1989 allowed Holly
Johnson, lead singer of the group Frankie Goes to Hollywood, to escape his
contract with a recording company called Zang Tumb Tuum. The court said the
contract, lasting eight or nine years, was 'grossly one-sided'. It was
unfair, the court held, for the company to own the copyright to the group's
songs while still retaining absolute discretion over whether albums were
released or not.
The court rejected the company's argument that the contract was necessary to
enable it to invest in groups which might not turn out to be successful.
Some record industry executives believe Sony has nothing to gain from
fighting the case. Even if the company wins, they say, it can hardly force
George Michael to record albums if he does not want to.
One senior executive said Sony had clearly mishandled its relationship with
the performer. He added: 'A lot of this business is built on personal
relationships. You have to understand that artists are sensitive people who
can easily feel rejected, particularly if they are going through a
creatively difficult time.'

same stony path
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROGER FORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You quote Mr Robert Horton, chairman of Railtrack - the new state
agency which will own the railway infrastructure after privatisation - as
justifying greater freedom from Treasury borrowing constraints on the
grounds that Railtrack's aim is to act as much as possible like a
commercially driven plc ('Greater financial freedom for Railtrack called
for', October 7).
The same plea could be made on behalf of British Rail, which has spent the
last 11 years reorganising itself as a commercially-driven, business-led
industry. Surely, the argument for continuing Treasury constraints on
nationalised industry expenditure is that the state remains the ultimate
guarantor of financial risk. This applies however the nationalised industry
is organised. In the government's eyes Railtrack can only be just another
nationalised industry monopoly, with all the pejorative overtones associated
with that title.
While the Treasury's new public sector leasing rules coming into effect next
year may introduce some private sector finance to the railways, it seems
that Mr Horton is following the stony path trodden by so many British Rail
chairmen in the past.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Make sure of tax credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From RICHARD W EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, When our family receives dividends by post from companies in which we
are shareholders there is often a tear-off form to request future dividends
to be paid directly into a bank account for the convenience of all
concerned. However, in the instructions as to how to complete the form, very
few companies mention that they would still send the tax voucher to the
registered address of the recipient.
If my experience is anything to go by, any such vouchers that are sent to
one's bank for eventual onward transmission to the shareholder either seem
to get 'lost' or disappear en route; I certainly will not sign a dividend
instruction unless the registrar agrees to send me the voucher showing tax
credit, holding etc. I wonder how many other shareholders take a similar
view?
Registrars of companies such as Southern Water and Rolls-Royce do indeed
mention on the form that tax vouchers will be sent direct to the shareholder
so why cannot others confirm similarly?

Sir, Sometimes, neo-liberal zeal risks turning an otherwise excellent

the fact that a cup of coffee costs more at the counter than at the table as
a definitive proof of the excesses of state intervention in Venezuela
('Anatomy of a stalled reform programme', October 4). However, what he fails
to consider is that, no matter the country - and its development strategy,
for that matter - the price for a coffee is always different depending on
whether one takes it standing or sitting.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Pension prejudice misguided
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From N F ROTHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, One begins to feel, on reading the reviews of your columnists and of
other journalists, first that the Goode committee recommendations are being
evaluated against the presumption that all employer-run pension schemes are
being managed by potential fraudsters and, second, that 'time is catching up
with the UK's occupational pensions industry'. The implication is usually
that final salary schemes are being 'caught up with'.
This strikes me as a triumph of prejudice over reason. I think it is not a
question of employees deserting final salary schemes, but that misguided
popular sentiment, compounded by regulation with which it will prove
expensive for the smaller scheme to comply, will increasingly dissuade
employers from offering final salary schemes.
At a stroke this will solve the contentious matter of the ownership of
surpluses (there aren't any in a money purchase scheme) and the employer
will be delighted to be rid of the open-ended commitment to make up the fund
if the investments are not performing in line with liabilities.
And what will fund members get? A group money purchase scheme or a personal
pension, the final outcome of either being both unpredictable and not
guaranteed. Further, they are subject to the state of the financial markets
at the time of maturity. In addition, the input value of the contributions
is likely to have been affected by the amount of salesmen's commissions.
Most final salary schemes will give the pensioner a better deal than the
above alternatives, but if people have been conditioned to preferring money
purchase schemes, I can only say let them get on with it and I hope that at
the end of the day they are satisfied with the result.
My preference is self evident. I understand that likely future patterns of
employment may make final salary schemes less relevant than they once were,
but that is no reason to threaten the interests of individuals who have
maybe 20 years or more of service in such a scheme and are likely to
complete full service. They are beginning to worry, not about a Maxwell, but
about the value of their fund or contributions being diminished by fiscal
discrimination and potentially expensive regulation, and perhaps even wound
up because their employer, wearied by the increasing hassle, opts for change
to a money purchase scheme.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Iron enters his soul: The odds on John Major's survival have
shifted this week from a whisker against to a whisker in favour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY

<TEXT>
Mr John Major's address to the Conservative party conference in Blackpool
yesterday was the most effective he has delivered to such a large audience
since he became prime minister. He appeared relaxed, in control. His jokes
worked, or at any rate some of them did. He asserted an air of authority. He
maintained his dignity. He allowed himself the expression of some passion,
and professed strongly held convictions. He came across less as the stilted
puppet embarrassing us all with talk of motorway rest rooms, which he did in
October 1992, and more as what he is in reality: an ordinary yet ambitious
man doing his best in extraordinary circumstances.
The content was another matter. Mr Major pandered to the longing of his
audience, particularly the elderly among them, for a return to a golden age
there probably never was: one in which rows of obedient schoolchildren sat
at their desks and did simple pencil and paper tests, the streets were free
of crime, miscreants were severely punished, the church was respected,
grandparents were held in high regard, and pornography was unheard of.
The ancient enemies - trade unionism and socialism - having faded,
replacement enemies have been disinterred. Many a conference speech this
week centred on the trendy liberals of the permissive 1960s. Mr Major gave
the untrendy conservatives of the 1990s what they say they want. This might
strike a chord with voters who feel disoriented by the atomisation of
society. It is a huge irony. The contribution of Tory policy to that
atomisation, to the widespread alienation of individuals from their
communities, was not touched upon. The 1980s were somehow missed out. Yet
the question asks itself: if crime is rampant, the budget deficit is out of
control, illiterates are being produced by our schools, and revered
institutions (such as the monarchy) are challenged, then who has been in
charge while all this has been happening?
The prime minister did not go into that. The essence of his 'back to basics'
theme was expressed by the education secretary, Mr John Patten, on
Wednesday. Parents must provide a caring and disciplined home environment,
said Mr Patten. 'And we should not be afraid to say so - even if we are
accused of wanting to turn the clock back. As Conservatives, we should be
proud of wanting to do just that . . .'
Mr Major clearly longs to turn the clock back - to an age in which prime
ministers were not vilified. He may have moved nearer to that objective
yesterday. Last year he repeated the words 'Britain' and 'British' in a
disastrous speech that did nothing to enhance his stature. This time he used
the Union Jack as a stage backdrop to his nationalism. Propped up by the
flag, he told the French to get their tractors off our lawn. He spoke with
precision. His thoughts were well-ordered. There may be more to him than has
so far met the eye. He is plainly capable of learning from his mistakes.
The broad strategy for the resuscitation of his prime ministership is now
clear. Every effort will be made to restore the public's confidence in the
Tories as the party of sound money, the nation state, law and order, and a
rigorous education. The Conservatives will be unashamed promoters of
business, big and small. As to Europe, the prime minister will stand on his
soapbox and campaign against federalism, just as in last year's election he
campaigned successfully against proportional representation and a Scottish
regional assembly. These were enemies of the British polity, to be voted
down. When he is whistling Rule Britannia, the picture of the Union Jack
behind him almost flutters.
Mr Major's performance may serve to silence some of his detractors. It is
not obvious that it was enough to save his job. Before he spoke, you had to
search for a long time in Blackpool to track down one of the rarest
specimens in contemporary British politics: the Conservative who has
complete confidence in his party's leader. It was especially difficult to
find any minister whose private view was that the party was well-led. It did
not matter whether the question was 'do you think he should resign?' or
'would it make a difference if the government was led by someone else?' or
'will he be forced out?'. Nor did it matter whether the answer to all or any
of these questions was 'no'.
The message was conveyed in other ways, by a hesitance before replying, by a
discursive response, by body language, by a shiftiness of the eyes. There
are a few exceptions - Mrs Virginia Bottomley is one - but in the opinion of
many of his close colleagues, the prime minister has used up all but one or
two of his nine lives. 'He should deploy the powers of his position,' said
one member of the cabinet. 'He must learn to convey a sense of direction,'
said another. 'He lacks ideology,' complained a third.
Yesterday he attempted, with some success, to show that he is capable of
meeting all three of those tests. He was less the glad-handing Midwestern
politician, more the occupant of Number 10 Downing Street. 'Who would have
thought it?' he mused in November 1990, on finding himself prime minister.
Latterly he has taken to receiving visitors alone in the cabinet room,
seated centre-table. Some of the aura of office has at last begun to enter
his soul.
The government's survival tactics for the next few months will be dictated
by the parliamentary arithmetic as calculated by Mr Richard Ryder, the chief
whip. To take a celebrated example, the final shape of rail privatisation
will be determined by the best package that can be negotiated with a handful
of potential backbench dissenters. Again, the biggest parliamentary hurdle
ahead is the Budget and spending package due at the end of next month.
Mr Kenneth Clarke will not be easily intimidated by the prospect of
backbench revolts. In happier times the chancellor would have had no need to
be. Perhaps he has none now. Even the most egotistical and self-opiniated
Tory rebel may be expected to pause before voting down her or his own
government's finance bill, whatever it contains. Yesterday's appeal for
unity by Mr Major may reduce the number of renegades.
There could, however, be defeats on details during the committee stages. Mr
Clarke has sensitive political antennae. He will know without being told
what would be too provocative to be assured of a safe parliamentary passage.
The imposition of an 8 per cent value added tax on domestic fuel from next
April and more than twice that from April 1995 is already legislated for,
although Labour may seek a procedural means of reopening the question.
Doubling up and taking the whole 17 1/2 per cent hit in 1994, which is one
of Mr Clarke's options, would do the job for the opposition.
Assuming that November passes safely by, the next determinant of Mr Major's
fate will be the judgment of the electorate in by-elections, May's local
elections and the elections to the European parliament in June. If these are
not the total routs suggested by the current state of voter discontent with
the government, the prime minister may regard the battle for the restoration
of his authority as half-won. In such circumstances he would doubtless
reshuffle his cabinet in July. That would be an opportunity to promote some
young bright stars, such as Mr Stephen Dorrell, and to spring a surprise,
such as appointing Lord Archer chairman of the Conservative party.
The latter is not the darling of the chattering classes, but he could be a
skilful street-fighter. He has been weight-training for the job for at least
seven years. His speech on Wednesday was electrifying; it was noted, with a
wry comment, by Mr Major yesterday. Lord Archer would bring a Hailsham
bell-ringing approach to the next general election. The existing chairman,
Sir Norman Fowler, could be moved to education. He knows how to run a
department. Mr Patten, the present incumbent, has yet to learn to do so.
What is going on? Here I am talking about budgets, long-range election
planning, cabinet reshuffles in midsummer next year, all as if Mr Major and
his government have a comfortable period of office ahead of them. Is this
not the clutch of half-competents that has been enduring the derision of the
country for the past year? Is this not the prime minister of whom the first
question on everyone's lips is: 'How much longer has he got?'
It is them, the very same. One more mishap, one further pratfall, and they,
plus their leader, will yet again be clinging to office by their fingertips.
But the season of political conferences has changed the script. It has shown
that the Labour party is not easily reformed. The fragility of the Liberal
Democrats' resurgence is now well understood, although, if the vehemence of
the attacks on the Lib Dems this week is anything to go by, Mr Paddy Ashdown
and his crew are greatly feared.
Fear can be productive. This week we have seen how Tory minds can be
concentrated by the spectre of opposition. The unity demonstrated at the
conference is a facade, but so is the unity of all large political parties.
The public face is what the public sees. The appearance of determination, or
grip, in Mr Major yesterday is something new, but it may develop into
something substantial. The Tories' hard line on crime, social security,
housing for unmarried mothers, education and Europe may be regarded as a
capture of the party by the right, but that is probably in tune with the
instincts of most core Conservative voters.
When the economic recovery gets under way, the government will become less
unpopular. Mr Major may trumpet, as he did yesterday, the prospect of
sustained non-inflationary growth. The odds on his survival, always finely
balanced, have shifted from a whisker against to a whisker in his favour.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Man in the News: Ford's new model man - Alex Trotman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was an occasion rich in symbolism. On Monday some 2,000 employees,
dealers and suppliers of Ford Motor, the world's second largest car
manufacturer, converged on the company's oldest assembly plant in the
Detroit suburb of Dearborn.
There Mr Harold Poling, chairman, drove a red convertible off the assembly
line, marking the start of production of a redesigned Mustang - a sporty,
moderately priced car which was wildly popular with young Americans when it
first rolled out of the same factory 29 years ago. It even inspired the
classic 1960s pop hit, 'Mustang Sally'.
Mr Poling also announced he would retire at the end of the year, naming his
successor as English-born Mr Alex Trotman, 60, head of Ford's worldwide car
operations, who will be the first chairman of the company born outside the
US.
The pairing of the events is significant, for Mr Trotman played a key role
in developing the new Mustang, and in the process displayed many of the
qualities which have won him the chairmanship - even though he was
considered a rank outsider a few years ago.
In 1990, as head of Ford's North American car operations, he faced a tricky
choice: should Ford allow the aged Mustang model to die quietly or spend
heavily to update it?
Many senior executives, concerned about costs, leant towards euthanasia. But
Mr Trotman argued, successfully, that the car had become a 'US icon'. It
was, he recalls, 'unthinkable to me not to have a Mustang'.
Ford, often criticised for its relatively slow delivery of new products to
market, went on to develop the new car in a record (for it) 36 months and a
tight Dollars 700m budget.
US consumers have yet to pass judgment on the vehicle, but its development
highlights Trotman's strengths. His broad experience in a 38-year career
with Ford has given him a keen understanding of what sells, together with
the rigour to control costs and product timetables tightly.
This practical experience must have weighed heavily with the board when it
chose him over the previous front-runner - the urbane, witty Mr Allan
Gilmour, a vice-chairman who had spent most of his career in finance or
staff jobs and lacked Mr Trotman's scars from the production trenches.
Another factor was Mr Trotman's international experience. He is the only
Ford executive to have run all three of its geographical sectors of
operation - Asia-Pacific (in 1983-84), Europe (in 1984-89), and North
America from 1989, when he steered the business through recession.
'Trotman is a very seasoned international executive, which is vital in a top
position today,' says Mr David Cole, a car industry expert at the University
of Michigan. Detriot's other two big motor manufacturers, General Motors and
Chrysler, have also appointed new chief executives in the past 12 months,
both similar to Mr Trotman in their international and production background.
This is a recent shift for Detroit, which used to be run (notably at General
Motors) by men from the finance side who knew little of the world beyond the
US.
Each of the US Big Three faces carmakers the same basic challenges: a market
that is increasingly global and where excess capacity means tight profit
margins and success only for those staying close to the consumer, while
maintaining the highest quality and tightest costs.
Ford seems the best-placed of the trio, with a slim US workforce and sharply
rising market share, thanks to vehicles such as the four-wheel drive
Explorer, though it is losing money in Europe.
But Mr Trotman is hardly complacent. 'We can do everything better than we do
it today,' he said this week. With a closely clipped moustache, erect
bearing and rather military air, he comes across as a very self-disciplined
individual.
'I carry lots of data with me,' he says, pulling several sheets of figures
from a suit jacket pocket. 'Very important data . . . I can tell you by item
the make-up of the Dollars 67bn of costs we have in North America. I can
tell you what all those items are, how it compares to '92, how we're doing
against budget. And I have it in my head how much better are we going to do
in 1994.'
The son of a carpet layer/upholsterer, he was born in Middlesex, raised in
Scotland (he still speaks with a gentle burr) and joined the Royal Air Force
after school.
After four years as a navigator, he answered a newspaper job advertisement
at Ford's Dagenham, plant in Essex, and learnt about production as a
'progress chaser' - making sure parts got from suppliers to the assembly
line in time.
His big break came when he played a key role in developing a new car,
code-named Archbishop, which became Ford's most successful British car of
the 1960s - the Cortina.
In 1969, anxious to get to the US, he persuaded a reluctant Ford to offer
him a job in Detroit (international staff did not normally transfer to the
US ) and rapidly moved up the hierarchy, taking US citizenship along the
way.
Colleagues describe him as a man of quiet self-confidence who pursues a goal
with intense determination (sometime excessively so) and is willing to take
unpopular positions.
He is a strong opponent of elitism and emphasises the importance of
communication and teamwork - useful qualities in an industry trying to
devolve more responsibility to its workforce and raise quality.
When he became head of US operations he scrapped separate executive dining
rooms and a tradition whereby top executives wrote memos on blue paper,
while lesser mortals used white.
The University of Michigan's Mr Cole sees his appointment as part of a
transition - also evident at Chrysler and GM - away from larger-than-life
chief executives (such as Chrysler's recently retired Mr Lee Iacocca) to
leaders who have more the qualities of a team coach.
'The top guy has to be someone who can keep a management team working
together . . . that becomes almost the most important criterion,' he argues.
It may be a less colourful way of running the industry, but in a complex
global market it may well be more efficient.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Hoping for the best
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'AS A CONSERVATIVE chancellor I simply cannot accept that a government
should be borrowing Pounds 1 for every Pounds 6 that it spends.' These were
brave words from Mr Kenneth Clarke at the Conservative party conference this
week. The question is not just whether he will try to do much about it, but
whether he will be allowed to by his party.
What Mr Clarke should do is clear: he should eschew fiscal fine-tuning and
deliver a medium-term fiscal profile that is credibly sustainable. In other
words, it should look sustainable, even if everything does not turn out as
Mr Clarke and his colleagues hope. Given the political timetable, most, if
not all, of the fiscal adjustment should be made now. Then, with a sound
fiscal position behind him, Mr Clarke could, if necessary, use monetary
policy aggressively to encourage a growth of nominal demand consistent with
low inflation and sustained economic growth.
There are two good reasons for avoiding fiscal fine-tuning: the first is
that there is little evidence that it works. The second is that the timing
of the new unified Budget rules it out in any case. A November Budget is too
early to make sensitive judgments about likely economic performance in the
next financial year, which begins only in April 1994. But this is not a
problem. It should be regarded as a blessing, instead.
In making his decisions, the chancellor does at least have the luxury of a
fairly satisfactory short-term position. The consensus of forecasters is
that the economy will expand by about 1.6 per cent between 1992 and 1993.
For next year the consensus forecast is close to 3 per cent. Even inflation
is expected to remain just below the government's ceiling of 4 per cent in
the year to the fourth quarter of 1994.
Crowd out
So far, so comfortable. The question is whether this growth can be
sustained. Fiscal deficits do matter in this context, principally to the
extent that they crowd out investment or are seen to threaten a rise in
inflation. At present, crowding out is not a problem. But medium-term
sustainability is. Last March, Mr Norman Lamont introduced a phased fiscal
adjustment of Pounds 10.3bn (1.4 per cent of gross domestic product) by
1995-96. Even so the public sector borrowing requirement was forecast at 3
3/4 per cent of GDP in 1997-98, on fairly conservative assumptions about
economic growth, while the ratio of net public sector debt to GDP was
forecast to double between 1991 and 1998. This is not demonstrably
unsustainable, but it leaves too many hostages to fortune.
The further adjustment of Pounds 4bn-Pounds 6bn ( 1/2 - 3/4 per cent of GDP)
being discussed by ministers is probably the minimum that is needed. To be
safe, it needs to be more. The problem is that the numbers for the deficit
have become too large to be politically manageable, particularly by a
fractious party, possessed of a small parliamentary majority and led by an
unpopular prime minister subject to constant attacks from embittered former
ministers.
One wing of the party insists that cuts should fall on spending. Next year's
control total (public spending less the cyclical elements) of Pounds
253.6bn, should not, says Mr Lamont, the man who agreed it, remain
sacrosanct. In response, Mr Clarke says that this is already the toughest
spending round he can remember in '14 years as a minister'.
Radical cuts
Who is right? Both of them are. Mr Lamont is right that spending plans
cannot remain sacrosanct if further tax increases are to be avoided. Mr
Clarke is right that what is likely to be virtually no real increase in the
control total is tight, at least by the sloppy standards of the last few
years. If the chancellor wishes to prove his case, he need only point out
that he, Mr Kenneth 'one-nation-Tory' Clarke, is demanding radical cuts in
welfare benefits, while Mr Peter 'no-turning-back' Lilley is refusing them.
Even Lady Thatcher herself is insisting that defence spending must be
spared. Radical public spending cuts are just not going to happen.
If spending cuts are difficult, tax increases look still less acceptable,
particularly economically sensible ones, such as extension of VAT. VAT on
fuel and power is only going to raise Pounds 2.3bn in 1995-96, a mere 5 per
cent of the projected PSBR. But just listen to the fuss. Meanwhile, nobody
in the Tory party is complaining much about the economically inefficient and
regressive proposal to increase national insurance contributions, which is
expected to raise almost exactly as much. Yet the deficit cannot be closed
by loading taxes more heavily on people who do not vote Tory, for the simple
reason that the party gains support from most of the people who have an
appreciable taxable income.
If neither radical spending cuts nor radical tax increases occur, the
government is reduced to hoping for the best. Some commentators even think
this is the ideal solution, so long as a dollop of cheap money is thrown in
as well. It is certainly the comfortable solution. But those who rely on
good luck are usually disappointed in the end.

FT  09 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Uneasy activists scatter
from rally with the fringe on top - How the week has been dominated by
gossip and a very real political vacuum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS the noises off that counted. From the stage of Blackpool's Empress
Ballroom the party faithful were calmed with populist rhetoric. But it was
the hubbub from the wings which told the story of this week's Conservative
conference.
The activists arrived bewildered by the government's incompetence, angered
by its failure to tackle crime and enraged by the imposition of VAT on
domestic fuel. They left with few solid commitments, but half-persuaded at
least that their voices had been heard.
They will never cheer Mr John Major with the passion once reserved for Lady
Thatcher. But most have decided at last that particular segment of the past
cannot be revisited. She stole the headlines this week but not the party.
Nor, in spite of the question mark which hangs over Mr Major's leadership,
do the activists lust for another execution.
But on the fringe (these days as important at Conservative conferences as it
used to be at Labour ones) and in the faded splendour of the Imperial Hotel,
it was a different story.
It was here that his colleagues pondered quietly and not-so-quietly whether
Mr Major's premiership could be rescued.
Here, the right and left claimed to be filling the ideological vacuum at the
top. Here were the subtle manouevrings of politicians who are not quite sure
if, and until when, their leader would survive.
The conventional wisdom was that the right wing won the day. The broadest
smiles were on the faces of Mr Michael Portillo, Mr Michael Howard and Mr
Peter Lilley. The 'bastards' appeared to exult in the label pinned on them a
few months ago by the prime minister.
They had a point. The perception of most in the cabinet is that on issues
such as law and order and family values a much tougher stance catches the
public mood. Bashing Brussels provided an easy safety valve for the party's
depression.
But the shift should not be exaggerated.
The Tory party at conference is always well to the right of its own
government. With one or two notable exceptions, ministers - and Mr Major -
prefer to pander to their supporters than to forgo that precious conference
ovation.
But this is still a centrist Conservative government. Mr Douglas Hurd has
not been transformed into a Euro-sceptic nor Mr Kenneth Clarke into a
free-market ideologue. In spite of his unexpectedly cheap jibes at the
bureaucrats of Brussels, Mr David Hunt remains an apostle of the social
market.
Mr Hurd, one of the few in the government able to lead rather than be led by
the Tory party faithful, offered an eloquent critique of the Maoist
revolution sought by some of his rightwing colleagues. Mr Major is still not
'one of us'.
The vacuum was revealed in the alternative ideologies presented on the
fringe - Mr Portillo offered the most convincing from the right - and the
gossip at the glittering parties hosted by Lord Archer.
Mr Major's call for a return to the values of the 1950s will not fill it.
Village greens, warm beer and neat rows of terraces appeal to the
sentimentality of the Conservative party.
Yesterday's speech was the one that Tory prime ministers make when they are
in trouble. Lady Thatcher made one like it in the late 1980s. But none of
his colleagues were pretending it was a prescription for purposeful
government.
For a range of reasons there is no enthusiasm in the cabinet for a change of
leader. The 'bastards' do not yet have a credible candidate. Mr Clarke is
not at all convinced that the party would survive another assassination.
Many hope genuinely that Mr Major will rebuild his authority.
But no-one is sure. His friends are impatient with Mr Major's failure to
mobilise the power of the premiership. His enemies are prepared to give him
only conditional support. They will not push him under Westminster's No 11
bus, but they are far from certain it will not knock him down anyway.
This week Mr Major won some time. It is possible that the history books will
record it as a turning point. But possible is the operative word.
The next few months, in the phrase of one senior minister, will be a 'bloody
winter'. Mr Major has cemented the alliance with the Ulster Unionists which
might double his Commons majority on issues of confidence. But ministers are
filled with foreboding that the habit of rebellion has become deeply
ingrained on the Tory backbenches. The Budget will provide plenty of excuses
for disloyalty. So too will the British Rail privatisation and the European
elections.
The prime minister has won a breathing space. He cannot afford to waste it.

FT  09 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Leaders attempt to
staunch Euro-split
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSERVATIVE leaders yes-terday moved to avert a split over next year's
European elections by warning that the party risks political suicide unless
it buries divisions over the Maastricht treaty.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman,
and Sir Christopher Prout, leader of the Conservative group in the European
parliament, all warned that a poor Tory performance would strengthen Labour
at Westminster and federalists in Brussels.
The warnings reflect concern that divisions over Maastricht, combined with
the government's unpopularity, could lead to substantial opposition gains in
the June elections.
The Conservatives lost a third of their European seats at the last election
in 1989, and emerged with only 32 of the 78 British mainland seats, compared
with 45 won by Labour.
Party leaders fear that up to a quarter of Conservative seats could fall.
Defeat on such a scale would seriously damage Mr Major, and could trigger a
leadership challenge.
Fears that the elections might turn into a re-run of the Maastricht debate
were revived on Thursday when Lord Tebbit, one of the strongest critics of
the treaty, said he would decline to campaign for some Conservative
candidates.
The leadership hopes to defuse the row by basing the election manifesto on
Mr Major's free market vision for Europe, expressed in a recent article in
the Economist.
The article, which argued strongly for a revival of national sovereignty
within the European Community, has been well received by right wingers, who
believe it demonstrates a substantial shift of policy. However, senior
ministers acknowledged that the tone of attacks on the EC had risked
alienating pro-Europe MPs on the centre and left of the party, who have been
loyal to Mr Major so far.

FT  09 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: MPs may observe Russian
election
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Foreign Office officials said yesterday that the government would
probably send a parliamentary delegation to Russia next month to ensure that
the new round of elections to the Russian parliament was conducted fairly.
In his address to conference yesterday, Mr John Major said that Mr Boris
Yeltsin, the Russian president, had invited Britain to send delegates to
Moscow to act as observers for the elections, due to be held in December.
The request came in a telephone conversation between the two leaders on
Thursday.
The Foreign Office said yesterday that observers for the forthcoming
elections would probably comprise a high-level team from the British
parliament, including several MPs.

to work
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL HESELTINE is to return to his office at the Department of Trade
and Industry next Wednesday after being assured by his doctors that he
requires no further treatment as a result of his summer heart attack.
Mr Heseltine plans to concentrate at first on the department's strategic
decisions, delegating less important work to others in his ministerial team.
He will also scale back the number of public engagements traditionally
undertaken by the secretary of state.

FT  09 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Hint at continued
donation secrecy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR NORMAN FOWLER, the Tory chairman, yesterday gave a strong hint that the
party would resist pressure for the identities of its major financial donors
to be made public.
At the end of the debate on party organisation, Sir Norman rejected any
notion of state funding for political parties, saying he would defend the
principle that people should be free to give money to political groups if
they wished.
'As with charities, if people wish to give money without publicity, their
privacy will be respected,' he said.
In recent months, the Labour party has campaigned strongly for the identity
of donors to party funds to be made public.
Several speakers in the debate on party organisation also said they were
concerned that the party leadership was not giving financial support in
retaining party agents in the constituencies.
However, Sir Norman said there had been a drastic reduction in spending,
which had been halved from more than Pounds 12m to Pounds 6m a year. 'We are
spending less now in real terms than at any time since 1979,' he said.

FT  09 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Strained fireside chat
delivers a glow of unity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS probably the most stage-managed speech in British political history.
To the detached observer, it looked strained, cynical, and deeply
un-British. But it worked.
After four days of synthetic platform unity, the party finally screwed up
its courage and discovered the real thing, or at least a plausible
imitation.
The prime minister promised a fresh approach, and he delivered it. Gone was
the autocue he has used in previous conferences, and with it the worst
excesses of the Dalek delivery.
Instead Mr Major relied on a mix of notes and memory. There wasn't much
spontaneity, and when there was, he overdid it.
It sounded more like a fireside chat than a rousing oration. If it was the
speech of his life, that was only because of the poverty of his previous
efforts.
But none of that matters much. Mr Major wasn't trying to win an Oscar, or to
impress the intelligentsia, which he knows will sneer at his
back-to-the-future message.
He set out to assuage the worries of the Conservative heartlands, and he
succeeded by pressing the right buttons - rising crime, bad schools,
national pride.
Conservative leaders always promise a return to greatness. But Mr Major went
further, specifically praising the values of the 1950s and ridiculing
'fashionable' theories on housing, crime and the family.
The message was in the language, and it was perfectly tailored to his
audience.
His critics call him weak, so he warned the French to get their tractors off
our lawn.
They say he cuts a poor figure on the world stage, so he talked about his
telephone call from Boris Yeltsin.
There were some good jokes, courtesy of Sir Ronald Millar, playwright and
former speechwriter for Lady Thatcher, for whom he penned the line 'the
lady's not for turning'.
For Mr Major, the best he could come up with was a joke about bookshops
selling 'memoirs to the right of me, memoirs to the left of me'.
If the speech lacked a big idea, blame Sarah Hogg and Nick True from the
Downing Street policy unit. But it could have been worse.
Mr True, an Oxford chum of Michael Portillo, was responsible for last year's
impassioned call for more toilets on motorways. Saving post offices will
play better than that.
It all added up to a 12-minute ovation, triggered by a video clip of last
year's ovation, and helped by the inevitable Elgar and a free red ensign for
every representative, courtesy of the British Chamber of Shipping.
The applause was passionate, and it was genuine. The party had found its
voice, and it didn't want to stop. If it looked more like the Republicans in
Boston than the Conservatives in Blackpool, they didn't care. But for those
who were only watching, it left a bad taste in the mouth.

FT  09 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Mixed views in Bridgwater
as Lib Dems wait to pounce - Roland Adburgham revisits the FT's panel of
voters in Somerset
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OVATION given to Mr John Major yesterday found an echo in at least one
corner of Somerset's Bridgwater constituency, where a small panel of voters
selected by the FT has sat in judgment on all three of the party
conferences.
'It was an excellent speech,' said Mrs Beatrice Forber, a Tory supporter who
admits she has been unhappy about the party in the past year. 'He is
suddenly coming into his own. I feel that the shadow of Thatcher has faded
and she will now go where she belongs - into the history books.'
The panel, however, was sharply polarised by the conference. Mrs Forber
considered it would 'steady the boat' and be 'tremendously helpful' in
dissuading Tory supporters from deserting to the Liberal Democrats.
Bridgwater is one of four Tory-held seats in Somerset which could be
vulnerable to the Liberal Democrats at the next general election.
Others thought rightwing sentiments expressed by some speakers might
alienate the uncommitted.
Mr Allan Challenger, a former member of the Labour party, was dismayed by
the tone of the conference. 'I found the discussions on law and order and
single parents putrid in terms of their prejudice,' he said. 'I fear that
the right is gaining dominance in the Tory party at the moment.'
He thought the conference might backfire on Tory attempts to spike Liberal
Democrat guns. 'Some of the language used has been so extreme that people
with misgivings about what the Tories have done to the social fabric would
be rather alarmed.'
Mr Hugh Barran, a solicitor and Liberal Democrat supporter, agreed. The
conference made the Tories appear 'less attractive, more doctrinaire and
less sympathetic'. They needed a sense of balance on issues such as single
parents. 'Any system of benefits has some room for abuse. But the right
appear to be taking it out on some people who are not capable of looking
after themselves properly.'
Mr Ian Weston, a Bridgwater businessman, also felt the Tories appeared
insensitive, but did not blame Mr Major. 'At the moment, he is the only
person whom I want to lead the Tory party . . . Kenneth Clarke would be
disastrous.'
The panel agreed that extending value added tax to domestic fuel would
continue to damage the Tories. Mr Challenger said: 'It is as bad a measure
as the poll tax in many ways and as ill-judged. I think they will live to
regret it.'
The first two articles in this series appeared on September 23 and October
2.

FT  09 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Major stresses Tory
commitment to Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday cemented his party's understanding with the Ulster
unionists by re-emphasising the government's commitment to keeping Northern
Ireland in the United Kingdom.
His unequivocal statement came against a background of continuing
uncertainty about the prospects for round-table talks on the future of
Northern Ireland, which have been stalled since last November.
Achieving the continuing support of the nine Ulster unionist MPs at
Westminster would double the government's paper majority of just 17, leaving
it much less vulnerable to backbench Tory rebellions on issues such as rail
privatisation of the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel.
'Northern Ireland is part of our democracy,' Mr Major said. 'We are not
going to bargain away the people's democratic rights, in order to appease
those who seek to rule by bullet or by bomb.'
He was vigorously applauded as he insisted: 'No government which I lead will
negotiate with those who perpetrate or those who support the use of
violence.'
Moderate nationalists are uneasy that the government may reward the Ulster
unionists for their support on the critical Commons votes on the social
chapter in July with changes such as a cross-party Westminster select
committee on Northern Ireland.
But the prospects of finding a solution also face other pressures.
The hard-line Democratic Unionist party has ruled out further participation
in the round-table talks process because of the initiative launched last
month by Mr John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party,
and Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein. While the British government is
doubtful that the Hume-Adams move will produce progress, Dublin seems more
warmly disposed towards it.
So long as the round-table talks have a chance of success, British
government ministers do not intend to offer any concrete moves to the
unionists.
Instead, Mr Major hopes to keep the support of the party's MPs by
emphasising the government's deep commitment to the Union - both he and Sir
Norman Fowler pointedly referred to the Conservative and Unionist party -
and contrasting that with Labour's policies.
Yesterday he attacked Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, for allowing Mr
Kevin McNamara, the Northern Ireland spokesman, 'to plan a united Ireland'.
While Mr Ian Paisley, the DUP leader, responded yesterday by accusing Mr
Major of 'trotting out all the usual Tory platitudes on Northern Ireland',
the signs so far are that the Ulster unionists are more amenable to the
government's approach.
He said the DUP 'will be watching closely' the response of Mr Major and the
Northern Ireland secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew to the Hume-Adams initiative
which received a warm response in Dublin this week.
Mr James Molyneaux, the Official Unionist party leader, told a fringe
meeting this week that he saw no reason to end the life of the current
parliament 'prematurely'.
In Dublin, government reaction was low-key because no shift was detected
away from Mr Major's previously stated policy positions.

FT  09 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Deregulation wins
conference cheers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL Hamilton, the minister charged with preventing business being
cocooned in red tape from Whitehall and Brussels, won the biggest
spontaneous ovation of the conference.
He rounded off a jocular bid for the leadership of the 'bastard' faction in
the government by ripping up an elongated sheet of detailed regulations.
Unlike the other ministerial 'bastards' recently subjected to a prime
ministerial rebuke, Mr Hamilton insisted that he was acting with the full
approval of Mr John Major.
He confirmed that a substantial deregulation bill would feature in the
legislative programme for the new parliamentary session.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Ministers may cut cash for Crossrail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT may scrap plans to make an upfront contribution to the cost
of the Pounds 2bn Crossrail transport project for London. This comes as part
of its drive to meet public spending targets for the next three years.
Ministers are considering instead asking private investors to fund the
entire cost of the scheme to build two tunnels under central London, while
agreeing to subsidise the project once it is up and running.
The move would have obvious attractions for the Treasury because it would
defer the time when public funds needed to be earmarked for the project
until later in the decade and help to resolve the fierce cabinet struggle
raging over departmental budgets.
Under the present plans, Pounds 65m of public money would be allocated to
Crossrail in 1995-96, with a further - as yet unspecified but probably
larger - amount required for the period 1996-97.
This is the year that is currently provoking some of the most intense
wrangling between ministers with the gap between Whitehall spending bids and
the agreed targets proving impossible to bridge.
Ministers had been anticipating a public contribution to Crossrail of
between Pounds 800m and Pounds 1.2bn. This would have left up to 60 per cent
of funding to be raised from the private sector.
In July, the government announced that another transport project - the
Pounds 300m resignalling of the busy London Euston to Glasgow line - was to
be funded and carried out by the private sector.
There has been mounting criticism of the government's progress in its
attempts to involve private-sector finance in public-sector infrastructure
projects.
Some private companies and critics in government spending departments say
that the private-sector initiative has become an excuse for delaying
projects such as Crossrail.
Crossrail would enable passengers travelling on suburban trains into British
Rail's Paddington and Liverpool Street stations to reach the West End and
the City without having to change to the Underground system.
The scheme is thought to be at least a year away from full clearance,
following the second reading of the parliamentary bill needed for it to go
ahead in June.
Mr Steven Norris, transport minister for London, said in June that the
government wanted the private sector 'fundamentally' involved in Crossrail.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Long-term unemployed '52% of Ulster jobless'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNEMPLOYMENT in North-ern Ireland still outstrips the rate in mainland UK,
with 52 per cent of the unemployed out of work for more than a year, an
advisory body said yesterday.
The Northern Ireland Economic Council says in its annual report that
unemployment in Ulster, at just over 14 per cent, is lower than a year ago.
But it is still substantially higher than the UK average of 10.4 per cent.
Output per head is only 77 per cent of the UK average, it adds.
Far-reaching structural adjustment would be required to close the gap in
living standards between the province and the rest of the UK, it says.
Although the economy has performed comparatively well over the last year
relative to the UK, unprecedented growth rates would be needed to bring it
up to mainland UK standards within the next decade.
To help eradicate structural weakness in the economy, the council recommends
increasing industrial research and development undertaken local-ly and
improving the proficiency of the local workforce.
It says that long-term unemployment is the most severe manifestation of
weakness, and suggests that resolving the problem should be at the forefront
of decisions on how to spend structural funds from the European Community.
The council recommends that reducing long-term unemployment should form the
basis for the community support framework for 1994-99, which states how EC
structural funds are to be spent.
The outlook for Northern Ireland is 'uncertain', it says.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Labour council launches partnership with private sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATE-sector companies are to be given a central role in formulating the
economic development policy and practice of Labour-controlled North Tyneside
Council under a partnership launched yesterday.
Nearly 40 manufacturing, energy and service-sector companies have agreed to
join the North Tyneside Economic Partnership, which aims to enhance business
success, employment and investment in the borough. As well as influencing
council economic strategy, the companies will help it bid for UK and
European grants, including funds from the new Urban Regeneration Agency.
Other Labour-controlled councils are seeking more private-sector
involvement. Newcastle City Council has established a steering group,
involving private companies, to prepare its economic development strategy.
The North Tyneside partnership builds on the government's City Challenge
concept, in which private-sector involvement was necessary for selection.
Partnership members include government departments, academic and training
institutions and economic development agencies.
It demonstrates how far North Tyneside Council - once reviled by
Conservative ministers as a 'far-left' authority - has moved towards a
pragmatic approach to its role. Mr John Foster, council executive director,
said: 'It's a change, but a change people are recognising is necessary and
moving in the right direction.' He hoped it would strengthen North
Tyneside's grant bids.
Mr Ralph Iley, the partnership chairman, is a former managing director of
the Cookson Group and a lifelong local resident. He said businesses which
argued they lacked the time to get involved were short-sighted. 'If you want
good people, good services, you have to have a good area,' he said. 'Good
staff aren't going to move to an area which is broken down.'
The Insurance Service, part of the Royal Insurance Group, yesterday
announced that it was basing its second regional service centre at the
Doxford International Business Park in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear.
The centre, to begin operating in the new year, is expected to employ 100
staff by the end of next year, rising ultimately to 350, all full-time.
The Insurance Service, a direct, telephone-based insurer, is based in
Bristol, where it has its first service centre. The new Sunderland site will
deal with new business, policy maintenance and country-wide claims.
Sunderland won the investment against competition from Peterborough and the
West Midlands. The Insurance Service said the financial package available at
Doxford was a key factor.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Tube map reaches final destination
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TUBE map drawn by hand in the 1930s from which today's map was developed
was yesterday donated to the London Transport Museum in Covent Garden.
The map, a design classic, has been copied by transport systems from Paris
to Tokyo. It will be on display at the museum from December 15.
Mr Harry Beck's schematic 1931 drawing, now displayed in 1,037 sites in
London alone, replaced a series of complicated geographical maps. It set a
standard for style and clarity which other transport systems have sought to
match.
The museum is particularly pleased with the acquisition because Mr Beck had
a 'difference of opinion' with London Transport and left the original to his
wife - who in turn left it to a friend who was persuaded to part with it.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Disclosure by late payers demanded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LEADING Scottish banker yesterday said companies should be required to
state in their annual accounts the average amount of time they took to pay
their suppliers.
Mr Bruce Pattullo, governor and chief executive of Bank of Scotland, said
this would help reduce late payment of bills, which causes serious
difficulties for small companies.
The time taken to pay bills would have to be confirmed by company auditors.
He said 29 per cent of the total assets of smaller manufacturing companies
were accounted for by trade debts. Earlier payment would free companies'
cash flow for investment or expansion.
Addressing the Scottish Council's international forum at Gleneagles, Mr
Pattullo suggested that the problem of trade credit 'would disappear
overnight' if the government announced that all departments and local
authorities would pay their bills in 30 days and that the private sector was
expected to follow suit.
This could be accompanied by a media campaign to identify and 'attach a
stigma to those companies, often well-known names, who continued to be slow
payers'.
Separately, Mr Pattullo urged the Scottish Office to persuade multinational
companies based in Scotland to buy more of their components locally.
He said only 25 per cent of all components used by multinational electronics
companies in Scotland were made locally - adding that if the level were
raised to 50 per cent it would have a considerable effect on the Scottish
economy.
Mr Pattullo said certain companies such as NCR, which makes automated teller
machines in Dundee, or IBM, which produces personal computers at Greenock,
Strathclyde, had successful programmes to encourage UK and Scottish
suppliers.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Pirate cards breach Sky defences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Financial Times yesterday obtained in the UK an unauthorised 'smart
card' to unscramble British Sky Broadcasting subscription channels such as
Sky Movies and Sky Sports.
The card arrived by post, with a Cheshire postmark, from Satellite Decoder
Systems of Warrington, a branch of an Irish business run by Mr David Lyons.
The card worked perfectly and produced pictures that were indistinguishable
from the 'real' thing - except that the pirate card produced the unscrambled
pictures more quickly, probably because the authorisation process had been
circumvented.
SDS said yesterday, after meeting with trading standards officers in
Cheshire, that it would continue to export the cards to the UK from Ireland.
Mr Geoff Holland, Cheshire's principal trading standards officer, said it
was illegal to import the cards and that if the importing was done directly
by customers they would be breaking the law.
He also made it clear that it was illegal under the 1990 Broadcasting Act to
use the unauthorised cards in the UK if, in doing so, the user intended to
avoid paying for the channel he was watching. Mr Holland said he would
examine the legal position on advertising and suggested that SDS
advertisements might breach the advertising code.
Mr Lyons said yesterday that SDS would contest a writ from BSkyB imposing a
restraining order on SDS carrying out any activities laid down as illegal
under the copyright laws. The satellite company, in which Pearson, publisher
of the FT, has a stake, will also seek damages.
Mr Lyons said: 'We contest that we have done none of the things they are
trying to take action on. All we have done is advertise in the UK.'
In the meantime SDS is continuing to challenge the ability of BSkyB's
engineers to neutralise its cards. 'Sky is running out of things to do,'
said Mr Lyons. 'We know all the information in their chip and if they call
their card in we already have the information they will be using on their
next card.'
The Motion Picture Export Association of America had already drawn up
proposals on the growing problem of unauthorised satellite cards across
Europe to submit to the European Commission for action.

EFFORTS TO avert possible strikes next month by 10,000 staff on London
Underground will begin on Monday when RMT, the rail union, meets Acas, the

The dispute is over London Transport's decision to fire two RMT members on
the Central line for indiscipline. The members were later re-hired for
different jobs.
The union held a strike on the Central line on Thursday and is planning two
more one-day strikes on October 14 and 21. A strike ballot of all

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RECOVERY in the housing market remains on a knife-edge, estate agents warned
yesterday. They urged Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to do nothing in
his Budget next month which would jeopardise an upturn.
Mr David Goldsworthy, president of the National Association of Estate
Agents, said that any plans to cut mortgage tax relief over the short term
could have a devastating effect on buyers' confidence.
The association's monthly survey of market trends showed London and East
Anglia had fared best last month, with 40 per cent of agents reporting
increased business, followed by Wales and south-east England. The national
average was 22 per cent.

FT  09 OCT 93 / London night flights to be cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of night flights at London's three main airports is is to be cut
to reduce noise, Lord Caithness, the aviation minister, announced yesterday,
Daniel Green writes.
The move was in response to a High Court judgment last month against a plan
that could have allowed more night flights using quieter aircraft.
The Department of Transport expects to be able to enact the proposals by
Tuesday so airlines can change their timetables for the winter season which
starts on October 24.
BAA, which operates Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports, said that the
airlines faced 'a challenge to change their schedules in time'.
British Airways said that the move would also mean more last-minute work at
next month's airline scheduling conferences which will prepare the ground
for the crowded summer season.
The new rules would mean an average of about 2.5 fewer flights a day
arriving at Heathrow in the early morning. This affects principally aircraft
coming in from the Far East and the west coast of North America.

FT  09 OCT 93 / EC aid may jeopardise established grants, MEP warns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LEADING MEP yesterday warned that the government has put European grants
to older areas of industrial decline in jeopardy by also seeking grants for
places such as Brighton, Bristol and Edinburgh.
Mr Wayne David, Labour MEP for South Wales and vice-chairman of the European
parliament's regional policy committee, said he feared Britain's traditional
industrial areas could lose out under the government's 'Objective 2' area
submission, sent recently to the European Commission, and due to be
published on Monday.
Inclusion on the map, which covers areas of industrial decline, gives access
to grants from the European regional development fund and the European
social fund. Between 1989-93, parts of Britain that qualified for Objective
2 grants received a total of Pounds 2.39bn, 38 per cent of the European
Community total.
Mr David claimed that the present UK submission included Brighton, Southend,
Portsmouth, Weymouth, Bristol, Edinburgh, parts of inner London, and also
Gibraltar, as well as areas such as north-east and north-west England,
central Scotland, the west Midlands and south Wales. At present, nowhere in
the south of England qualifies for Objective 2 grants.
A map to take effect from January is now being produced. It will cover no
more than 15 per cent of the EC population, but Mr David said member states'
submissions total 22 per cent. The map covers just over 16 per cent at the
moment.
He said: 'It means the traditional industrial areas are effectively
competing with these new areas the government has submitted. Some of these
new areas have very real problems - that has to be recognised - but I don't
believe they should be helped at the expense of the older areas. I fear that
will happen.'
The EC has allocated a total of Pounds 10.7bn for Objective 2 grants between
1994 and 1999. The grants cover up to 50 per cent of the cost of projects to
assist economic and social regeneration.
The Department of Trade and Industry received hundreds of representations
from areas anxious to retain or gain Objective 2 status.
The places concerning Mr David are not on the government's assisted areas
map, which determines eligibility for UK government aid.
EC criteria for Objective 2 status include unemployment, falls in industrial
employment and substantial recent or threatened job losses.
It is believed that more UK places have been submitted than are expected to
qualify. The DTI refused to confirm Mr David's information but said: 'The
commission will choose what areas stay on the list and what areas have to be
knocked off.'
The EC is also redrawing its Objective 5b map, covering rural areas
experiencing transitional problems.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Independent raises prices and expands in face of Times cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWSPAPER Publishing, owners of The Independent and The Independent on
Sunday yesterday took the decision to raise its prices in the face of the
price-cutting campaign by The Times.
The Independent on Sunday, which is being expanded tomorrow to a
four-section paper with colour, will raise its price from 90p to Pounds 1.
From Tuesday the daily paper, which will move to two sections with colour,
will go from 45p to 50p making it 20p more than The Times.
Mr Patrick Morrissey, the new chief executive of Newspaper Publishing, said
that readers were being offered considerable added value.
'We believe our readers will recognise this and will be prepared to pay a
realistic price for continuing improvement in quality and the continuing
independence of their newspapers,' he said.
The Times' 15p price cut has added around 100,000 copies to the previous
total of around 360,000.
The official circulation figures for the six months to August show The
Independent at 339,602 and The Independent on Sunday at 373,427.
The Newspaper Publishing strategy, complete with price rise, seems to be to
try to occupy the slot at the top of the general broadsheet market that it
believes is being vacated by The Times.
All efforts at Newspaper Publishing will now be concentrated on the
re-launch and a major marketing exercise to try to increase circulation.
A planned re-financing, possibly with the introduction of a new shareholder
has in effect been postponed until early next year.
The pressure has been eased because The Independent's circulation has
apparently not been hit by The Times. The Independent's sales are slightly
up although not by as much as normal in the autumn.
Mr Morrissey, who joined the company at the beginning of this month, wants
to see how the business performs this autumn.
There is even a hope that, if the re-launch is a success, significant
re-financing can be delayed for some time - as long as the government does
not decide to impose value added tax on newspapers in next month's Budget.

FT  09 OCT 93 / BBC ready to scrap Radio 5
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNORS of the BBC are set on Monday to approve the creation of a
combined news and sports service to replace Radio 5.
The announcement will represent a victory for Radio 4 listeners who have
campaigned for more than 18 months to stop the loss of Radio 4's long-wave
signal to a 24-hour rolling news service. The original plan would have meant
that Radio 4 would only have been carried on FM, depriving listeners in
areas of poor FM reception. Those who listen to Radio 4 in continental
Europe on long-wave would have lost their service.
The planned service will be very different from the original rolling news
plan. In particular there will be no news magazine programmes such as Today
from Radio 4.
Instead there will be a very flexible schedule aimed at a younger audience.
On the days of major sports events, they will take precedence and when big
news stories break they will get most emphasis. The times of news bulletins
will be flexible to avoid interrupting the last minutes of a vital game.
The service, which will not be called Radio 5, has already been agreed in
principle by the BBC's board of management. It will consider a final version
of the plan on Monday morning before a formal recommendation goes before the
governors later in the day.
It is believed that Ms Jenny Abramsky, head of BBC radio news and current
affairs, will run the station.
At the beginning of this year, senior BBC radio executives were still
insisting that it would not be practical to put the news service on Radio 5.
Childrens' and schools' programmes now carried on Radio 5 are expected to
move to other channels.
The compromise solution on Radio 5 fits in with the recent BBC realisation
that it may have been over-serving the articulate middle classes and now
plans to offer more to the general audience.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Two linked to Belling loss charged with Pounds 4.9m fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO MEN LINKED to the loss of Pounds 2.3m from the pension fund of Belling,
the cooker manufacturer which collapsed last year, have been charged with
defrauding companies and private individuals in Britain and abroad of a
total Pounds 4.9m.
Mr Charles Deacon, a solicitor based in Newcastle-under-Lyme, and Mr Keith
Fuller, a business consultant, were yesterday remanded on conditional bail
of Pounds 125,000 and Pounds 100,000 respectively and are due to reappear in
court on Friday. The bail, subject to suitable sureties, was granted at
Stafford High Court late yesterday following an appeal against the original
magistrates' decision to remand the men in custody.
The two have been jointly charged with four offences dating back to 1986:
obtaining Dollars 3.5m (Pounds 2.3m) by deception from Belling, similarly,
Pounds 1.2m from Kristen Nielsen of Denmark, cash and property worth Pounds
880,000 from Bratsklpk of Russia, and Pounds 575,000 from Arbuthnot Leasing
International.
Three of the four charges state that money was obtained by falsely
representing that a fee was an advance payment for a larger loan. They
further state that the pair falsely represented that the advance would be
held by Mr Deacon's company until credit arrangements had been made.
Two years ago Belling sought to arrange a Dollars 50m capital injection
through a company called Global Prospect Funding, where Mr Deacon was a
director. In advance of the deal, Belling paid Pounds 2.1m as the first
year's interest. The company borrowed the money from the pension fund to pay
the fee, but the loan never materialised.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Farmers pressed to sign milk deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MILK MARQUE, the successor to the government's compulsory purchasing scheme
under the Milk Marketing Board, is putting pressure on farmers to sign
supply contracts before the industry becomes a free market in April.
Mr Andrew Dare, chief executive of Milk Marque, sent out contracts to
farmers yesterday, calling on them to make a 'positive decision'.
He said they were 'free to sell their milk to whomever they wish', but added
that failure to take any action may mean that their milk would not be
collected after April.
However, the dairy industry questioned the legality of Mr Dare's contracts
as the government has not yet approved plans for the reorganisation of the
board into Milk Marque.
Mr Jim McMichael-Phillips, president of the Dairy Trade Federation, said:
'I'm terribly uneasy about this and will need to give careful consideration
to any legal redress available to member companies.'
Mr McMichael-Phillips criticised the government for not ensuring that all
milk buyers got off to a fair start in attracting farmers to supply them.
Many dairy companies are looking to buy their milk directly from producers.
Mr Dare has said that if the government imposed important changes to the
board's reorganisation plan, he would contact farmers who had already signed
contracts, asking them if they wished to reconsider.
However, the contracts, which will get to most of the UK's 29,000 dairy
farmers on Monday, are legally binding.
If farmers want to leave Milk Marque in the first year, they will have to
pay a penalty of 2 per cent of annual milk sales.
Mr Richard Smith, a dairy farmer who heads the Northern Milk Partnership
which will buy milk on behalf of Northern Foods, said: 'We are being asked
to sign a legally-binding contract bearing no reasonable indication of price
with an organisation that is totally untried.'

FT  09 OCT 93 / 500 jobs to go at Devonport naval dockyard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE and ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLYMOUTH'S Devonport naval dockyard, which earlier this year won a bitter
battle to refit Britain's Trident nuclear submarines, yesterday announced
plans to shed 500 jobs.
The reduction, more than a tenth of its workforce, is more severe than was
indicated by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, in June. He
predicted that the reorganised naval refitting programme would mean 350 job
losses.
Devonport Management (DML), which operates the dockyard, said it hoped to
achieve the cut through voluntary redundancies. The reduction, to be carried
out in the next six months, will leave a workforce of 4,400, one third of
the level in the mid-1980s before the dockyard was placed under
private-sector management.
Redundancy payments will be borne by the government, which still owns the
dockyard facilities.
DML said the earlier government predictions were based on business forecasts
for 2000. The company hoped that the level of employment would be maintained
or increased by then, although not necessarily through permanent jobs.
But Mr Bill Goffin, Plymouth district secretary of the AEEU electrical and
engineering workers' union, said the latest job losses would not be the
last. 'You can double that figure over the next six to 12 months,' he said.
The announcement from DML came a week after confirmation from Mr Rifkind of
the government's decision to concentrate future work on nuclear submarines
at Devonport.
This work has been the backbone of business for Devonport and the rival
Rosyth yard in Scotland. In compensation, Rosyth is to be allocated more
than half the programme of work on navy surface ships. Devonport will have
to compete for remaining surface ship work against Rosyth and private-sector
shipyards.
Yesterday's announcement, while not unexpected, is a serious blow to the
Plymouth area, where the dockyard is easily the biggest employer.
Unemployment in the Plymouth travel-to-work area is well above the national
average at 12.7 per cent.
Devon County Council said: 'When Devonport catches a cold, the whole of
Devon sneezes.' The decision showed the need for broadening the area's
industrial base. 'We will being pushing even harder for government and
European assistance.'
The job cuts partly reflect a dip in DML's commercial business due to the
completion of yacht-building contracts.
Turnover in the current financial year to the end of March is expected to be
similar to last year's at around Pounds 250m.

FT  09 OCT 93 / BNF cleared of blame in child leukaemia case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Nuclear Fuels was cleared by the High Court yesterday of allegations
that radiation from its Sellafield reprocessing plant had caused leukaemia
in children.
Rejecting damages claims brought on behalf of two children of former
Sellafield workers, the judge said that it had not been proved that
childhood leukaemia was linked with possible genetic damage caused by the
irradiation of their fathers' reproductive organs.
An independent study claiming such a link, upon which the legal cases were
based, was unsupported by other evidence and contained shortcomings which
reduced the confidence which could be placed in it, Mr Justice French said.
The cases were brought by Mrs Elizabeth Reay, whose daughter died of
leukaemia in 1962, and Miss Vivien Hope, who contracted non-Hodgkin's
lymphona.
They claimed that a study carried out by Professor Martin Gardner, an
academic medical statistician, had demonstrated a causal link between the
diseases and mutations in fathers' sperm caused by the radiation from
Sellafield.
However, Mr Justice French accepted arguments by lawyers for BNF that the
report was flawed and unsupported by other scientific research.
Mr Alvin Shuttleworth of BNF said afterwards that the company was pleased
with the judgment but had great sympathy with the families.
The cases were the first in which a court had been asked to rule on personal
injury claims based on alleged genetic damage. It was seen as a test case
for up to 40 other potential claims against BNF.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Ford to streamline stock distribution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD is planning to introduce a new car distribution system in the UK
intended to reduce stocks held at dealers' premises and to significantly cut
the total number of vehicles in its supply pipeline.
The company is being forced to revamp its distribution methods in order to
catch up with radical changes already announced by Rover and Vauxhall in the
last 18 months.
Both maintain that the changes will save them and their dealers tens of
millions of pounds a year. Ford said yesterday that it planned to introduce
a pilot scheme during the first half of next year.
The Ford system is expected to follow the Rover and Vauxhall patterns,
whereby dealers will draw their cars from a network of large regional
storage facilities, each linked strategically to either a Ford assembly
plant in the UK or, in the case of imported vehicles, to their port of
entry.
More than half of all new cars sold by some leading carmakers are
transferred be-tween dealerships to satisfy customer orders, rather than
going directly to the dealer.
Traditionally main dealers have had to hold six weeks or more of stocks.

FT  09 OCT 93 / AEEU vows to fight drain on subscriptions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S largest manufacturing union - the AEEU engineering and electrical
union - has called a meeting of all its full-time officials to discuss how
to minimise the impact of new labour laws. THe union says they will threaten
80 per cent of its annual income.
'The very future of our union is at stake,' Mr Gavin Laird, general
secretary, said yesterday. 'We are about to enter a battle for survival.'
The union's fears stem from the provision in the government's Trade Union
Reform and Employment Rights Act which says employers cannot deduct union
contributions from their employees' wages unless in the past three years
those concerned have signed an authorisation to allow this.
The legal threat to the existence of the so-called check-off arrangement
could damage further already weakened unions, which receive an estimated 80
per cent of their income from membership subscriptions collected for them by
employers. The AEEU, which is meeting on Tuesday, is the first union to
mobilise its officials to combat the problem.
'We are bound to lose some members as a result of the new legal provision,'
said Mr Laird. 'We know already of some small engineering companies which
have announced they are withdrawing check-off facilities. This new law is
designed to emasculate the unions.' As much as Pounds 20m of the AEEU's
annual income derives from the subscriptions collected from 80 per cent of
its 800,000 members under the check-off arrangement. The union fears that as
there is no legal obligation on employers to operate check-off, some may use
the new statutory requirements as an excuse to withdraw the arrangements.
Under the law, workers covered by check-off before August 30 this year are
each required to give their specific approval for the arrangement within 12
months. This means every member on check-off must sign the necessary form of
authority before August 30 1994. Union officials are allowed to collect the
necessary authorisations and give them to the employer. The AEEU will tell
its officials at the meeting on Tuesday that it wants the signed forms with
employers no later than the end of next June.
An alternative to check-off is for union members to pay subscriptions
through direct debit transfer from their bank accounts. At present only 2
per cent of AEEU members do this and Mr Laird wants to raise this figure to
10 per cent.
The other option is to return to the traditional system under which union
stewards collect subscriptions at the workplace directly from the members,
although Mr Laird says this can be disruptive and inefficient. The
Engineering Employers Federation said yesterday it had not offered any
advice to its members on what to do about the new law.

FT  09 OCT 93 / BAe confident on Taiwan deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace said yesterday it was confident that a long-delayed joint
venture with Taiwan Aerospace Corporation (TAC) to build regional jets would
go ahead, writes Daniel Green.
It said one of the causes of the hold-ups had been the disruption to the
command structure at TAC culminating in the resignation of its president, Mr
Denny Ko, last week. Mr Ko had signed the original agreement with BAe in
January to create the joint venture company, called Avro.
BAe is trying to restart talks to bridge remaining differences between the
two sides later this month.
Taiwan wants to enter civil aerospace as part of its industrial policy, but
opposition politicians have attacked the proposed venture on commercial
grounds. TAC's board next meets on October 19 and the government indicated
this week that it would leave the decision on Avro to the board.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Israel will free most Intifada prisoners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL is ready to free almost all of the more than 10,000 Palestinian
detainees it is holding for Intifada related offences, as a confidence
building measure in the run-up to the start of Palestinian self-rule in Gaza
and Jericho next spring, writes David Horovitz in Jerusalem.
A plan for the release of the detainees was presented yesterday to Mr
Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, by army chiefs.
Final details of the prisoner release are to be hammered out at talks
between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators beginning next Wednesday.
Mr Rabin confirmed on television last night that 'prisoners will be freed'
but he declined to give details. However, a source close to him said the
plan provided for the freeing of most Intifada offenders, but the transfer
of several hundred top security prisoners - 'those with blood on their
hands' - from West Bank and Gaza jails to prisons inside sovereign Israel.
The army also detailed its proposals for ensuring the safety of Jewish
settlers, for co-operation between Israeli and Palestinian security forces,
and for the construction of various bypass roads to ensure secure travel for
Jews in the territories.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Ghost of Vietnam looms over Somalia muddle: The dilemma
facing President Clinton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton may have pacified for the moment a restless Congress
and public with his exposition on Thursday evening of US policies in
Somalia, doubling the size of US forces there but promising the withdrawal
of almost all of them by March 31.
But he did not answer, even to the satisfaction of those sympathetic to his
dilemma, many of the questions still surrounding the US involvement in a
distant country where, in the post-cold war era, no apparent US national
interest is at stake. Perhaps the biggest of these is his assertion that
conditions on the ground in Somalia will be so much improved six months from
now that the UN and other nations, including Africans, can assume the US
burden.
In purely domestic terms Mr Clinton undoubtedly scored points with his
argument that the US simply cannot 'cut and run' because American soldiers
are killed or captured. Quoting General Colin Powell, the immensely
respected and just retired chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, to this
end lent an additional validity.
It also helped that he disavowed any central US role in shaping Somalia's
future in the longer term beyond trying to prevent in the months ahead a
return to anarchy and starvation and sending Mr Robert Oakley, the diplomat
who knows Somalia well, back to facilitate any negotiations.
But Mr Clinton's attempt to strike a middle ground between the twin poles of
an early withdrawal and a bigger commitment struck many in the US as
indelibly reminiscent of the early stages of US involvement in Vietnam.
Already, comparisons are being freely made in the media here between General
Mohammed Farah Aideed, the Somalia faction leader, and Ho Chi-minh, the
Vietcong master tactician. The sense that his rag-tag, though well-armed,
urban army would be easy meat for US firepower has been disabused by last
weekend's disastrous engagement.
Mr Clinton said in his speech, which never mentioned General Aideed by name,
that it was crucial not to personalise the situation, and yesterday Mr Les
Aspin, the secretary of defence, did not rule out negotiations with the
warlord.
Yet US officials seem uncertain about General Aideed's intentions. On the
one hand there is fear that he may seek to exploit US captives, as the
revolutionary regime in Iran did in 1979-80: on the other it would be
logical for him to lie low and husband his resources until after US forces
depart, thus undermining Mr Clinton's rationale that the US merely wanted to
make it possible for Somalis 'to reach agreement among themselves'.
In this muddled context, the precise role of the beefed-up US military
contingent remains unclear, beyond the task of protecting forces already on
the ground. The president's mission statement included a reference to
keeping the pressure on those who would frustrate the political process and
the delivery of humanitarian supplies, but whether this amounts to a fully
fledged assault on General Aideed's forces in south Mogadishu is unknown.
There is also palpable tension between the US administration and Mr Boutros
Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general. He is widely accredited with
persuading the US to go after General Aideed after the murder of 24
Pakistani peacekeepers in June which, in turn, led to the loss of American
lives.
It follows that there is little confidence in the ability of Mr Boutros
Ghali and the UN to assemble the sort of peacekeeping presence able to take
over from the US. If he fails - and if Mr Oakley is also unable to persuade
other African nations to step in - then Mr Clinton may find himself facing
another tricky decision next spring.
There is another serious consequence of the Somali question. The tenor of
political and public reaction in the US can leave no expectations that the
US would agree to send its military to help enforce any peace in Bosnia were
a settlement there to be reached. Indeed, it will only require a US soldier
to lose a life in Haiti, where 600 are supposed to smooth the way for the
return of President Jean Bertrand Aristide, for the overall cause of
peacekeeping in American eyes to have been dealt a grievous blow.
But buying time with Congress and the public does help. Mr Clinton's
popularity ratings, awful this summer, are recovering towards where he stood
at his inauguration, mostly because he has seemed more sure-footed and
innovative at home. That is the business he needs to get back to.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Labour tension threat in Japan over jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S trade union movement shed some of its traditional compliance
yesterday by urging employers not to cut jobs and wages.
The call came in a resolution at the end of the annual convention of the
7.8m-strong Rengo trade union confederation. While bland by European
standards, it points to the arrival of labour tension, the latest
consequence of Japan's worst recession for 20 years.
The downturn has already forced some of the biggest companies to shed jobs
and consider cutting bonus payments, in the process challenging the post-war
traditions of lifetime employment and generous overtime pay.
Mr Akira Yamagishi, Rengo president, warned that the confederation was
determined to win pay rises in next spring's annual wage round, despite
companies' efforts to cut wage bills. Management demands to choose between
pay cuts or job cuts 'can never be accepted'.
Rengo, which represents nearly 12.5 per cent of the workforce, has been
Japan's only union federation since its foundation in 1989 from a merger of
labour groups.
It is unclear how unified it is or how it will try to achieve the aims it
spelt out yesterday. The main electronics unions appear ready to accept a
small decline in bonuses, and unions generally have been unwilling to take
effective strike action.
Rengo's resolution also urged the government to cut income tax by Y5,000bn
(Pounds 31bn) and to abandon plans to lift the retirement age from 60 to 65,
needed to ease the demands on the social security budget.
Japan's employment problem is nothing like as serious as that of its US and
European competitors. Nevertheless, the workforce has been worried by the
long series of job cuts and warnings on pay.
Earlier this week Mr Takeshi Nagano, chairman of the Nikkeiren employers'
federation, warned that management would consider cutting salaries to ensure
full employment in the next fiscal year. At least three leading carmakers
are considering reduced winter bonuses this year and two steelmakers may
give staff extra time off on low pay.
Wages were under pressure even before the latest squeeze. The average
private sector rise last year was 1.9 per cent, the lowest for 34 years,
according to the national tax administration agency. Growth is widely
expected to be even lower this year and next.
Koyo Seiko, the bearings producer, yesterday became the latest Japanese
company to announce job losses. It will shed 1,200 jobs. Japan's economy
will not grow at all this calendar year, according to latest estimates by
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, revising down
its provisional growth forecast of 1 per cent last July.
Mr Kumiharu Shigehara, head of the OECD's economic department, told Japanese
newspapers growth would be slightly less than 2 per cent next year.
Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance minister, called the estimate 'pessimistic', but
admitted that recovery had been stalled by an unusually cool summer and a
stronger than expected yen. However, he saw no reason to devalue the yen, in
response to news conference questions.

FT  09 OCT 93 / US peace initiative bypasses the UN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US, bypassing the United Nations, has written to the president of
Ethiopia, proposing an international inquiry into violence in Mogadishu
blamed on warlord Mohammed Farah Aideed, Reuter reports.
The initiative appears similar to a proposal from Gen Aideed to former US
president Jimmy Carter last month when Gen Aideed offered to submit to the
judgment of a special commission.
At the time the proposals got short shrift from UN secretary-general Mr
Boutros Boutros Ghali and the US.
US ambassador Madeleine Albright announced the news to a Security Council
meeting at which members supported President Bill Clinton's decision to send
more troops into Mogadishu but also concentrate on political moves to
reconstruct the country.
Several diplomats questioned the parallel political moves by Washington as
Mr Boutros Ghali was heading to Ethiopia to bring African leaders into the
peace process.
The bodies of two US soldiers have been recovered from Sunday's fierce
street battle in Mogadishu, raising the death toll to 15. Another three are
still missing.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Mandela wants S Africa to join Lome pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NELSON MANDELA, the African National Congress leader, yesterday asked the
European Community to allow a democratic South Africa to join the Lome
Convention governing trade, aid and co-operation between the EC and 69
developing countries.
At talks in Brussels with Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president,
and Mr Manuel Marin, EC development commissioner, Mr Mandela is understood
to have expressed a preference for accession to the Lome accord, rather than
other options for EC-South African relations.
The ANC president won EC pledges to help build a new civil service, army and
police force, and Community support to prepare voters for multiracial
elections next April.
Mr Mandela said that while South African membership of Lome was under
discussion, the republic's mixture of pockets of wealth surrounded by
backwardness meant it should be regarded as an economy in transition, rather
like the central European economies.
The EC has progressive market access and substantial aid agreements with
east and central Europe. But current thinking in Brussels favours a
relationship with South Africa as part of a more integrated bloc of nations
in southern Africa. This is based on the premise that Pretoria would join
the Southern Africa Development Community, which South Africa already
dominates economically by the strength of its trade and industrial links.
EC officials are uncomfortable with the idea that South Africa, with
comparative advantages in areas such as agriculture, a developed financial
system, industrial capacity, and advanced transport and communications
infrastructure, should be slotted into a format such as Lome designed to aid
much less developed former colonies.
Meanwhile in New York, the UN General Assembly yesterday agreed to end most
economic sanctions against South Africa, two weeks after Mr Mandela, in an
address to the world body, proposed lifting the restrictions
However, the oil embargo will remain in place until the Transitional
Executive Council agreed last month becomes operational, probably around the
end of the year.
In South Africa the government was yesterday criticised by the ANC and the
Pan Africanist Congress for an early morning raid on a home in Umtata,
Transkei in which five people died. The PAC denied that the house was used
by its military wing.
Meanwhile, conservatives have formed the Freedom Alliance, grouping former
members of the Concerned South Africans Group (Cosag) - Bophutatswana,
Ciskei, Inkatha, the Conservative Party and Afrikaner Volksfront. At the
same time, Bophutatswana and Ciskei withdrew from the negotiating council -
the forum for multi-party talks - and ended all meetings with the government
and ANC.
The Alliance's short-term aim is to present a single, united negotiating
team which will seek concessions on federalism from the ANC. In the longer
term, it seeks to displace the National Party as the country's second
largest political group behind the ANC.
