FT  15 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Intrum Justitia sees static result
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Intrum Justitia, Europe's leading debt collector, yesterday fell
28p to close at 100p after warning that the declining value of Nordic
currencies and a delay in recovery in Switzerland would hit profits for this
year.
In September the group, based in the Netherlands and listed in London,
reported pre-tax profits up from Pounds 6.81m to Pounds 7.47m for the six
months to June 30.
However, the group said annual profits after tax would be 'approximately the
same as for 1992, which is below current market expectations'.
Last year pre-tax profits were ahead 26 per cent at Pounds 16m. The final
dividend of 2p made a total for the year of 3p. The group still expects to
recommend an increase in the final dividend this year.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Yorkshire confirms approach by LWT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Pounds 600m battle over the future of London Weekend Television hotted
up yesterday as Yorkshire-Tyne Tees admitted formally that it had received
'a preliminary approach' from the London broadcaster.
Mr Ward Thomas, chairman of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, was prompted by speculation
to acknowledge the approach, which could involve LWT taking over Yorkshire
and Anglia Television acquiring Tyne Tees.
Under new government rules, which come into effect on January 1, one ITV
company can hold two broadcasting licences but no more.
Neither LWT nor Anglia would make any statement on their intentions
yesterday.
Granada, the television, rental and leisure group, which last week launched
a hostile bid for LWT, immediately pounced on the Yorkshire admission.
Mr Alex Bernstein, the Granada chairman, said the announcement meant LWT had
accepted the Granada view that scale was essential if ITV was going to
compete effectively.
LWT shareholders, Mr Bernstein said, would be faced with a clear choice: to
combine with 'one of the strongest and best managed media and leisure
companies in the UK' or to combine with an ITV company 'making significant
losses and burdened with high licence payments'.
LWT shed 12p to close at 576p yesterday; Granada finished up 6p at 501p.
The defence led by Sir Christopher Bland, chairman of LWT Holdings, will
outline the thinking behind the approach to Yorkshire. The hope is that
eventually LWT-Yorkshire and Anglia-Tyne Tees would be allowed to combine to
form a super-region - even larger than that created by Carlton
Communications' planned takeover of Central Television.
Sir Christopher insisted yesterday he would never buy any company as a
'poison pill'.
Granada turned its attack yesterday on any possible LWT-Yorkshire tie-up and
pointed out that the combined annual bids that have to be paid to the
government for Granada and LWT amounted to Pounds 16.6m or 5 per cent of the
two companies advertising revenue.
With LWT-Yorkshire the figure would be Pounds 45.3m or 16 per cent of
advertising revenue.

FT  15 DEC 93 / C&amp;W quits the biddingfor Hungarian group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK telecommunications group, yesterday pulled out of a
consortium bidding for a 30 per cent stake in Matav, the Hungarian state
telecoms concern, only hours before the deadline.
C&amp;W withdrew from the MagyarCom consortium, leaving Deutsche Telekom, the
German state-owned operator, and Ameritech, the US regional Bell company, as
the remaining partners.
The UK company said it had 'reluctantly concluded' that its strategic
objectives would not be addressed by its 'continued involvement as an equity
partner'.
It is understood that C&amp;W was unhappy with the shareholding structure of the
group, which gave 50 per cent to Telekom and 25 per cent each to C&amp;W and
Ameritech. C&amp;W was also uncomfortable with Matav's price after fierce
competition from the three competing consortia which put in final bids
yesterday.
Offers are believed to range around Dollars 900m (Pounds 605m), valuing
Matav at nearly Dollars 3bn and making the privatisation the largest yet in
eastern Europe.
C&amp;W's international experience had given credibility to MagyarCom's promise
to develop Hungary as a regional telecoms hub. The UK company's withdrawal
weakens Telekom in its battle against rival groups led by France Telecom and
Italy's Stet International. The outcome is expected on December 17.
Stet, which heads a partnership with Bell Atlantic of the US, put in the
highest preliminary 'indicative' bid and is believed to have raised its
final bid to more than Dollars 900m.
France Telecom and its partner US West, the regional Bell company, have
mounted a high-profile public relations campaign presenting their bid as the
most technically inspired. US West has a stake in Hungary's largest cable
television operator and has promised to transfer its experience of
multimedia broadband networks, allowing Hungary to make a technological
'leapfrog'.
Hungary's budget deficit continues to miss targets agreed with the
International Monetary Fund and so proceeds are expected to be a priority in
evaluating bids.
It is not the first time that Budapest has been hungry for revenue and
bidding has become too rich for C&amp;W. This summer Hungary maximised proceeds
in the tender for two digital mobile telecoms concessions. C&amp;W's consortium
dropped out after refusing to raise its bid from Dollars 12m. The winning
bids approached Dollars 50m.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Forte closes in on Ciga as competition falls off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forte's chances of acquiring the Italian-based Ciga luxury hotel chain rose
last night when Host Marriott of the US withdrew its competing bid.
Host Marriott said it had suspended negotiations to acquire Ciga because it
had been given insufficient information to counter Forte's offer.
ITT Sheraton, which had also expressed some interest in Ciga, said last
night that it had not submitted a bid for the chain.
Forte executives are expected to make a presentation today to Mediobanca,
the Milan merchant bank that has organised a restructuring of the highly
indebted Ciga.
Forte said last October that it had agreed to take over the management of
Ciga, which has net debts of more than L1,000bn (Pounds 397m).
Under the agreement Forte said it would pay Pounds 33m cash and insert some
of its own luxury hotels with a value of about Pounds 125m into an Italian
operating company, in which it would have a majority interest.
Ciga's bank debt would be transferred into a separate property holding
company in which the operating company would have a 15 per cent stake.
The deal would give Forte access to a prestigious luxury hotel brand -
something it sought in the 1980s with its bid for the Savoy group. The
agreement to manage Ciga raised questions over whether Forte would need to
continue its pursuit of Savoy. Ciga has 35 hotels in Italy, Austria, France,
Greece, the Netherlands and Spain.
Some of Ciga's creditor banks were unhappy with the Forte agreement,
however, and criticised Mediobanca for not examining alternatives. Barclays
of the UK was believed to have been one of the most vociferous critics of
the agreement with Forte.
Host Marriott emerged as the most credible rival to Forte last month when it
said it was in discussions over the possible acquisition of Ciga. It said
Marriott International, its sister company, could run some or all of the
hotels.
Although ITT Sheraton said a bid for Ciga was under 'preliminary review',
Host Marriott's discussions with Ciga were seen as a more potent threat to
Forte.
Forte, which has been conducting its due diligence investigations of Ciga,
argued that it had more experience of running luxury hotels than the other
two groups.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Trafalgar House loses Pounds 347m: Rights issue to raise
Pounds 404m - Charges total Pounds 468m / 1p payout this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Simon Keswick, chairman of Trafalgar House, yesterday described the
group's Pounds 425m rights issue and placing as a 'fresh start' for the
troubled conglomerate that posted a pre-tax loss of Pounds 347.2m in the
year to September 30.
The loss, which compares with a restated pre-tax deficit of Pounds 11.2m,
was struck after the group recorded exceptional charges totalling Pounds
397.3m (Pounds 97.3m), comprising asset write-downs, property provisions and
rationalisation costs. Shares in Trafalgar, which has interests ranging from
engineering and construction to London's Ritz Hotel and the Cunard liners,
fell by 10p to close at 77 1/2 p yesterday.
Mr Keswick, who is also chairman of Hongkong Land Holdings, which holds a
25.3 per cent stake in Trafalgar, said the Pounds 404m net proceeds of the
1-for-3 convertible preference share issue and placing would provide the
group with 'a strong and transparent balance sheet'. The Pounds 70m placing
was designed to attract new institutional investors to the group. 'It is all
part of starting afresh,' he said.
Hongkong Land, which has already invested about Pounds 200m in its Trafalgar
equity stake, said it planned to take up its full entitlement at a cost of
about Pounds 90m. It would also apply for additional shares under the
placing.
The announcements underline the degree to which Hongkong Land dominates
Trafalgar's new management team, which took over from Sir Nigel Broackes,
the former chairman, and Sir Eric Parker, former chief executive, last year.
In addition to Mr Keswick, Hongkong Land's four board representatives
include Mr David Gawler as finance director. Mr Keswick insisted that the
extensive write-downs and provisions did not represent a 'kitchen sink'
approach to the accounts.
He described them as 'just normal prudent accounting'.
The new board's review of the balance sheet led to write-downs and
provisions of Pounds 330.7m, including provisions announced at the interim
stage of Pounds 100m. Asset write-downs charged to revaluation reserves
added Pounds 39.8m.
A change in accounting policy on capitalising finance charges added Pounds
30.6m to exceptional items, rationalisation programmes Pounds 65.3m and
directors' compensation payments Pounds 1.3m. The charges totalled Pounds
467.7m.
Although substantial property and other provisions had been expected, some
elements were a surprise - for instance, Pounds 42.1m for its ill-fated
Emerald oil rig, Pounds 22.3m for group properties and Pounds 17.5m to cover
early repayment of costly debt.
Over all these charges swamped the group's Pounds 77.5m of operating
profits, down from Pounds 126.8m. Turnover was flat at Pounds 3.88bn.
The 47.6p loss per share compares with a 12.2p loss. A final dividend of 2p
makes a total of 3.25p, against 6p. However, shareholders were told to
expect a total of not more than 1p for the current year.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Avoiding hazardous stocks in a bull market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This far into a bull trend the general market risk may seem to be
reassuringly low - there have been no substantial reversals for many months
 -but we still suffer specific risk. That has been painfully obvious in the
UK during the past few days as various companies including Fisons,
Courtaulds Textiles and Trafalgar House have issued warnings or unveiled
skeletons in the cupboard.
There are echoes of the minefield characteristics of the US market a few
months ago when blue chips ranging from IBM to Philip Morris appeared to be
making a habit of badly upsetting expectations.
In the UK really substantial sectors such as breweries, food retailing and
pharmaceuticals are showing declines on the year even though the stock
market as a whole is up nearly 20 per cent. Such sectors look rather dull,
and the heavy volume of money coming into the market has been chasing more
exciting prospects. Those have to be found (or invented) in the cyclical
recovery sectors, several of which have produced sector index growth of more
than 50 per cent in 1993 so far. The question is, however, whether investors
are in touch with what is going on in the real world. In particular, don't
they know that there is still a serious recession in continental Europe? Do
they know that apparently unstable politicians are receiving millions of
votes in Russia?
During 1992 investors were selling property companies and gold mines, which
were at the bottom of the sector league tables. In 1993 property and gold
mines have been soaring back to prominence and are right at the top. The
transformation does not make investors look very clever at anticipating
events, but it does demonstrate the power of liquidity flows in relatively
small stock market sectors.
In a liquidity-driven bull market the weight of money will drive prices
higher. As long as interest rates are falling, the stretching of the
valuation basis can be justified by reference to historical ratios of the
yields available on bonds and equities. But eventually bond yields will
cease to decline; it may well be that the US long Treasury bond yield
bottomed out two months ago at 5.8 per cent (although the UK government
long-dated bond yield, now little more than 6.5 per cent, is still falling).
The bull market in equities must then end unless improved corporate
fundamentals can take up the running. There has to be a shift to an
earnings-driven market.
This can be tricky, because there are obvious contradictions. Bonds respond
positively to weak inflation and low economic growth (unless growth is so
weak that the stability of government financing is threatened). Companies,
in sharp contrast, want an economic environment in which they can raise
prices and achieve volume growth. But in the UK, manufacturers' output and
prices have been stagnant since the summer. The implication is that although
the bond bull market may continue to run, equity valuations are becoming
more and more stretched. We can expect more shocks as companies try to bring
investors into closer contact with reality.
However, the apparent progress of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
talks towards a reasonably successful conclusion, in spite of the cultural
and agricultural sensitivities of the French, has naturally helped the
securities markets in the past few days. For all the fashionable comparisons
of the 1990s with the 1930s, we shall not have to contend this time with
self-destructive trade politics.
But in the context of a sluggish world economy it may well be that the
initial benefits of a new Gatt round will come in lower inflation rather
than growth in output. Manufacturers in the advanced countries will be under
still more competitive pressure from the industrialising nations, and the
focus will be on sectors of special advantage such as, in the case of the
US, the entertainment industry whose interests the Americans have been so
carefully fostering.
The investment implications could therefore be that there will be more good
news for bonds in many western countries, but also more pressure on the
valuation basis of equities and, most obvious of all, more specific risks.
Toss away your yield ratio charts and start honing up your stock selection
skills.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Noble Lowndes fined Pounds 740,000 over poor investment
advice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Noble Lowndes and Partners, the financial adviser, has been fined Pounds
740,000 by City regulators for breaches of rules, including giving bad
advice to customers.
Imro, the self-regulatory organisation for the investment management
industry, said yesterday that the firm had admitted four disciplinary
charges.
As well as the fine, Noble Lowndes must pay Imro's costs of Pounds 45,000
for the disciplinary action. So far it has also paid out Pounds 580,000 in
compensation to customers.
NLP said that the charges of giving unsuitable advice and 'churning' -
buying and selling shares under management for no other reason than to earn
commission - related to the activities of four personal financial services
consultants. None of the four, who operated from offices in Leeds and the
Midlands, is still working for NLP.
Between May 1988 and February 1992 they engaged in 'systematic' switching of
investments between products in ways that 'were not justified from the
customer's objective'. Altogether, 225 clients were involved.
Imro launched a formal investigation in April this year to examine possible
breaches of its rules from one branch office which had been drawn to its
attention by NLP's internal audit.
In consultation with Imro, NLP appointed the accountancy firm Binder Hamlyn
to conduct a thorough review of all the client files concerned. When it is
finished in about six months, its investigation will have covered samples
from the files of up to a third of the 240 sales consultants employed over
the relevant period.
Imro also found that NLP had failed to keep proper written records on, for
example, customers' circumstances or their understanding of the investment
risk, and it criticised the procedures for monitoring compliance and for
identifying potential 'churning' of customers.
All the costs are to be met by the TSB group, which sold Noble Lowndes to
Sedgwick, its present owner, in September for Pounds 110m.
Mr Robert Walker, managing director of personal financial services at NLP,
said yesterday that the charges related to single-premium investment
products, such as bonds or unit trusts.
Although NLP provides actuarial consultancy services for the pensions
industry as well as giving financial advice, the mis-selling did not relate
to pensions business.
Mr Walker and Mr David Strauss, NLP's chief executive, highlighted the
changes in compliance procedures and in management that Sedgwick had made,
and emphasised its commitment to ensuring that all clients were fully
compensated.
In June, Imro imposed a Pounds 750,000 fine on Invesco MIM, the fund
management group, which admitted 55 breaches of City rules.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Halifax cuts rates to savers by 0.5 points to aid lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Halifax building society, the UK's largest, has cut its rates to most savers
by 0.5 percentage points from today.
The Halifax move to widen its margins to support mortgage lending follows
its announcement last week of a reduction of 0.35 percentage point in its
base mortgage rate, to 7.64 per cent, which followed the recent 0.5 point
cut by the Bank of England in base rates.
The conflicting pressures on societies over their savings rates - which must
attract investors and enable societies to offer competitive mortgage rates -
were shown by Alliance &amp; Leicester, the fourth largest. Having cut its rates
to investors, it launched a one-year investment bond intended to compete
with the government's plans for a 'granny bond'.
Woolwich building society, the third largest, followed Halifax with a cut in
its rates to savers of an average of 0.41 percentage points.
Its standard variable mortgage rate is to fall by 0.24 points, to 7.75 per
cent, to existing borrowers in January, and to new borrowers with immediate
effect.
Mr Dick Spelman, Halifax general manager in charge of marketing, said the
new savings rate represented a fair balance between the interests of the
society's borrowers, who total almost 2m, and its 12m savers.
A&amp;L's move reflects concern among societies about the government's plans for
a guaranteed income bond for people over the age of 65. The A&amp;L bond, called
Special Edition, will carry a variable interest rate and will offer the
option of taking a monthly income if a balance of more than Pounds 2,500 is
maintained.
Further evidence of societies' concern to keep their savers came from
National &amp; Provincial, the eighth largest. It said that where its savers had
obsolete accounts yielding little interest, even if they did not respond to
being asked which new account they would like to transfer into, it would
move them automatically to whichever it thought the most appropriate.
Retail savings are particularly important to building societies, since,
unlike other mortgage lenders, their access to cheaper, wholesale markets is
limited by their regulatory regime.

FT  15 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: European airlines
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The collapse of the Alcazar alliance has led to a big strategic rethink in
the European airline industry. But the need to rationalise operations means
that carriers are still seeking alternative groupings. Austrian Airlines
said yesterday it was in talks with Swissair and Lufthansa over strategic
co-operation. But it may stumble for the same reason Alcazar failed.
Lufthansa is firmly wedded to United Airlines as its transatlantic partner.
Swissair remains linked to Delta.
Swissair's 10 per cent shareholding in Austrian and close operational links
suggests that the two carriers will move as one. And Swissair seemingly
favours the re-creation of Alcazar with Austrian and SAS but minus KLM. By
exploiting Swissair's existing links with Delta and Singapore Airlines, a
combined carrier could emerge as a viable global operator.
Such bold action will be needed by many European airlines if they are to
secure their future. British Airways and KLM are emerging in a league of
their own as efficient low-cost carriers boasting attractive hubs and
international networks. KLM is committed to further rationalisation and may
feel it can go it alone, especially if it could raise fresh equity. Other
European airlines will jostle for position in the second division.
Lufthansa, Swissair, Austrian, and SAS must cut their cost bases to regain
competitiveness. Air France will have to implement its latest
rationalisation plan just to remain in the game.

<TEXT>
The scale of interim dividends from regional electricity companies should
not hoodwink investors into expecting similar generosity at the full year.
Yesterday's 20 per cent increase from Southern Electric was aimed - like
others in the sector - at rebalancing the dividend away from the year-end.
Some investors will doubtless buy stock for the additional interim payment,
in which case the shares might suffer more than usual after the ex-dividend
date.
Still, dividend growth of perhaps 15 per cent this year is reason enough to
hold electricity shares and explains why the Recs have out-performed water
companies. Both sectors were privatised on yields 50 per cent above the
market average. While water remains weighed down by regulatory worries,
electricity companies have broken free. Yields, a shade above the market
average, show how far the risks are seen to have diminished.
Since both sectors face regulatory reviews next year, that out-performance
might seem strange. But with dividends covered three times by earnings and
positive cash flow under all but the most draconian settlements, Recs look
better placed to cope with tighter price controls. Water companies will be
borrowing heavily to finance capital expenditure through the second half of
the decade. Dividends will thus remain a potential point of conflict with
the regulator. Since the Recs have both a stronger hand and greater freedom
to distribute, the yield differential looks like more than a passing phase.

FT  15 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Gatt
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Excitement at the prospect of a successful Uruguay Round has not spilled
over into European equity markets. Part of the reason for yesterday's falls
is that there is an inclination to take profits in many markets anyway. Part
is that the consequences of failure in the Round were always seen as more
serious than the benefits of success. Trade liberalisation does open the way
to non-inflationary growth, but only over an extended period. Some
industries inevitably face painful adjustment first.
Failure would have brought the immediate risk of disruptive trade conflicts
which might have justified a sharper sell-off in equity markets. As it is,
the deal does not mean that peace has broken out in every area. The US is
retaining the notorious section 301 of its Trade Act which permits
unilateral action against trading partners, and there is clamour for
something similar in Europe too. There is still the risk of conflict in
areas like steel and audio-visual trade - French television stocks were
conspicuously weak yesterday.
Moreover, the good news from Gatt was overshadowed by the Russian elections.
Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky seems to be toning down his rhetoric. But he remains
an unpredictable politican who has established a power base in a country
that seems unable to cope politically with economic adjustment. Western
financial markets may have to discount the impact on confidence, not to
mention a possible curtailment of the peace dividend. Against that
background, a tortuously agreed Gatt deal hardly constitutes a buy signal.

FT  15 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Trafalgar on dry Land
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Longstanding shareholders in Trafalgar House have reason to be grateful to
Hongkong Land. Had it not ridden to the rescue with the backing of its old
friends at HSBC, the company would by now almost certainly be in the throes
of a painful debt rescheduling. So it may be impolite to ask too many
questions. Two are worth considering anyway. Did Hongkong Land know what an
expensive business it was buying into? And does it matter that Hongkong Land
has taken effective control while owning just 25 per cent of the shares?
Only Land knows the answer to the first. If it still believes in the
long-term rewards, one must suspect after yesterday's provisions and
write-downs that it was unprepared for the short-term pain. Otherwise it
could have waited until the shares were cheaper. The second question may
matter little at present. That will change as the company recovers. Land's
interests and that of other shareholders will not then necessarily converge.
Land's minority stake would then look increasingly incongruous.
Take the dividend, for instance. Land does not need the cash. It should be
more naturally interested in boosting Trafalgar's earnings by seeing the
company pays a minimum in ACT. The new convertible issue looks attractive in
terms of yield - watch out for switching when the shares go ex-rights - but
the ultimate appeal depends on the conversion rights. That in turn requires
a rapid build-up of the dividend. If there is a grand scheme behind its
involvement, Land has yet to reveal it. But it is already too late for
anyone to complain.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Fluctuations in the balance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The past 15 months have seen one of the most spectacular series of exchange
rate upsets in Europe since the breakdown of the gold standard in the 1930s.
Since early September 1992, the lira, Swedish krona and peseta have declined
by between 23 and 24 per cent against the D-Mark. Sterling's fall has been a
less dramatic 7 per cent, although at one stage 10 months ago it was down 16
per cent.
Moreover, because Europe's hardest currencies, the D-Mark and guilder,
themselves have declined by 14 per cent against the dollar over this period,
the lira, krona and peseta have fallen by roughly 35 per cent against the US
currency during the last 15 months.
Analysing the effects of these changes on countries' trade balances is a
complicated matter. This is partly because exchange rate changes affect
exports and imports in different ways and with long and variable time lags.
Measurement has been made especially complicated by the erratic quality of
trade figures this year for countries of the European Union, because of
statistical changes after the introduction of the single market at the
beginning of 1993.
Unpublished figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development, however, give an indication of the consequences. These figures,
based partly on estimates because of delays in collating EU statistics, show
the total volume of exports of manufactured goods from Germany and France
fell by an annual rate of 10.8 and 11.3 per cent respectively in the first
six months of 1993. This followed increases of 1.9 and 5 per cent
respectively in 1992. Among other ERM members, Belgian manufacturing exports
fell 6 per cent in the first half, while for Holland the volume fell 3 per
cent.
The largest export gains in the first half of 1993, according to the OECD,
were registered by Finland (up 25.1 per cent), Spain (up 12 per cent) and
Italy (up 9 per cent). British manufacturing exports fell 2 per cent by
volume in the first half, apparently reflecting sterling's relative firmness
after its earlier sharp falls, following a 2.6 per cent increase in 1992.
Individual countries' trade figures, although affected by greater than usual
statistical uncertainties, also provide a measure of the impact.
According to official Italian figures, Italy's total exports rose 19 per
cent in value in the first half of this year compared with the same period
in 1992. The rise in volume terms was 7 per cent.
The UK's overall visible trade deficit declined to Pounds 7.6bn in the first
eight months of the year from Pounds 13.4bn in the whole of 1992, with the
improvement particularly in trade with non-EU countries.
Spain, too, has profited from three devaluations of the peseta within the
ERM since autumn 1992. Improved export competitiveness, combined with the
effect of recession in reducing imports, has led to a sharp reduction in the
trade deficit this year, with Spanish exports growing by an estimated 7 per
cent in real terms this year, according to official Spanish statistics.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Jaw-jaw in Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The meeting between the British and Irish prime ministers planned for today
should result in an agreed statement on the way forward to a peace deal for
Ulster. It is always a mistake to be unduly optimistic about Northern
Ireland, as the latest IRA 1,000lb bomb, discovered and defused in Belfast
yesterday, indicates. Yet there is evidence of a strong desire for peace in
both the north and south of Ireland. More to the point, the possible
outlines of an eventual peace agreement that should command support from all
but the most recalcitrant extremists can now be discerned.
One element might be some form of devolved assembly for the governance of
the province. Its exact composition and functions would have to be
negotiated with the legitimate political parties of Ulster. Once the IRA has
convincingly turned away from violence Sinn Fein will doubtless be invited
to join those negotiations. Mechanisms for co-operation between Dublin and
Belfast might be included in the eventual package.
Such constitutional details are of secondary importance to the Anglo-Irish
declaration of intent on which Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds spent so
much telephone time yesterday. In this delicate area every word is
potentially lethal. Both prime ministers propose a guarantee that the
constitutional status of Ulster will not be changed without the consent of
its people, but agreement on everything else has been difficult.
Referendum
The IRA, which should not be permitted to call the tune, might, it appears,
accept a northern veto on Irish unity, but only if the proposition is first
approved by a referendum of all the people of the island of Ireland, north
and south. That is unacceptable to many unionists. Mr Reynolds has offered
to relinquish the articles in the republic's constitution that claim the
territory of Northern Ireland, in return for a British statement recognising
as legitimate, and promoting, the aspiration for Irish unity. Mr Major has
had to consider the possibility of setting off a new outburst of violence by
loyalist paramilitaries if he appears to lean too strongly in the republican
direction.
In marches and opinion polls the people of Ireland and Ulster have expressed
their desire for the talks between the two prime ministers to succeed.
Business leaders concur, as the FT's survey of senior business opinion in
the province indicates. The poll, taken on Thursday and Friday of last week,
reflects the views of chief executives of leading firms. Of 80 companies
approached, 56 responded. This suggests an unprecedented willingness to
express a business view of the politics of Northern Ireland. It is a measure
of the economic damage that the troubles have done.
Opportunities
Perhaps it is not so surprising that 90 per cent of those who replied to the
FT questionnaire said that an agreed political settlement that achieved an
end to the violence would have a 'very' or 'fairly' positive effect on
business and economic opportunities. The chief executives were, however,
evenly split on the prospects. Most of them do not believe that terrorism
can be defeated by military means. Some 70 per cent believe it impossible to
defeat the IRA; the corresponding figure for the loyalist paramilitaries is
64 per cent.
In the nature of things in the province business leaders are more likely to
be Protestants than Catholics. It is striking that 61 per cent of them
accept the notion of separate referenda in both parts of the island, albeit
on the assumption that the purpose would be to affirm a deal guaranteeing a
majority veto in Northern Ireland and leading to an end to the Republic's
constitutional claim to the north.
There is also a remarkable degree of support for negotiation with Sinn Fein
 -36 per cent at once, or as soon as the IRA announces that it will abandon
violence, and 59 per cent after the IRA has kept to a peaceful path for a
period of time. Just over half the respondents favoured stronger devolved
power structures in the province, and a third thought business would prosper
if there were north-south links. This survey reflects moderate opinion.
Today's statement of intent should challenge terrorists on both sides to lay
down their arms.

A round of applause, please, for Britain's high street banks. Their branch
staff manage to answer the telephone within three rings, 63 per cent of the
time. Admittedly, it's not as good as most of their commercial customers,
but it's better than their deadly rivals - the building societies.
So reports a company called Teleconomy, which rang 615 bank and building
society branches. However, when it extended its search for bank staff who
could say more than 'what?' and 'don't know', the banks came out less well,
particularly in the south east, where only the Royal Bank of Scotland's
branch in Station Road, Reading, was rated 'excellent'.
But building societies staff need not be too down-hearted at the results.
They might be slower to answer, but they were friendlier when they did so.
Nationwide came top, while Lloyds Bank, which trains staff to answer calls
within four rings, scraped in fifth.

The UK water industry is, not surprisingly, prone to fishermen's tales. Some
of them are even true, such as this one. Martyn Webster, managing director
of Southern Water, suggests that European Union bureaucrats have failed to
consider the full implications of increasing water and sewage treatment
before it is chucked out to sea via three-mile pipes.
Webster says fish eat what he coyly refers to as 'solids', and that the EU
directive - well-intended though it may be - will unwittingly deprive fish
of popular feeding grounds, and fishermen of income.
Not sure the Eurocrats will bite on that one, Martyn.

Has John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, gone soft? The cabinet's most junior
member and its resident rightwing rottweiler, had a perfect opportunity to
stake his claim as Baroness Thatcher's heir when he addressed the
parliamentary press gallery's monthly lunch yesterday. Instead, he delivered
a boring eulogy on the citizens' charter and the prime minister's
back-to-basics campaign.
To make matters worse he retold rather a good story about his arrival in
Downing Street as an adviser to Mrs Thatcher 10 years ago. Annoyed by being
constantly described in the press as a hardliner, he complained to Bernard
Ingham, the prime minister's redoubtable press secretary. 'In this business,
you're either a hardliner or a wet. Which do you want to be?' Ingham
responded. Up to now, no-one has been in much doubt.

Concerning Gerald Corbett, the man who moves from the finance director slot
at Redland to the same position chez GrandMet, the market is agreed on one
point - that he is extraordinarily ambitious.
But, while news of his departure took a bit off the Redland share price,
GrandMet's share price wobbled more yesterday. Both markdowns can't be right
and the super-confident Corbett could not help sounding mildly unsettled.
The difficulty seems to be establishing when an accomplished finance
director becomes a numbers man who is simply too clever by half. While the
food and drinks conglomerate has a high level of disclosure, the complex
figures still need a lot of explaining. But then, for an upwardly mobile
fluent communicator, surely that is half the fun?

The picturesque Jack Valenti must be a disappointed man. President of the
Motion Pictures Association of America, Valenti can but weep at the Gatt
negotiation's apparent failure to achieve a US-European Union deal on
audio-visual trade.
Lyndon Johnson's former presidential speech writer, Valenti's efforts
finally seemed to have been defeated by the stubborn French yesterday. But
at least he was briefly able to bask in the glare of public attention once
more, last experienced with such intensity when he and fellow Texans
scuttled from the White House along with Vietnam-plagued Johnson.
In his current battle Valenti showed he had lost none of his talent for high
drama. In one of his keynote addresses on the subject - 'The Unique,
Matchless Non-Clonable US Trade Prize: The American Movie' - Valenti likened
the appearance of EU directives on the audio-visual landscape to 'vagrant
weeds in a lovely
garden'.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Gatt and the media
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is tempting to conclude that the decision to exclude audio-visual trade
from the Uruguay Round is the inevitable result of divergent perceptions.
The US negotiating position has been based on the outright pursuit of
economic advantage. But according to the European Union, and particularly
France, the central issue is the preservation of cultural identity.
However, the distinction is largely false. Though some of the EU's arguments
have merit, many look like a smokescreen for efforts to perpetuate cosy
broadcasting practices which serve the interests of politicians and media
monopolists more than those of viewers. On these grounds, Europe has as much
to lose as Hollywood from the failure to agree a liberalisation deal.
The EU's case is strongest, and Washington's weakest, on the question of
subsidies. The US wanted curbs on public funding of film and entertainment
production. Yet it also insisted American artists should share the proceeds
from European levies on recording tapes. As well as being inconsistent, this
latter demand was an unacceptable attempt to intervene in the fiscal
policies of sovereign states.
However, the biggest stumbling block has been the EU's attempts to limit the
proportion of programming from outside its frontiers which may be shown on
television. Such restrictions already apply, in principle at least, to
national broadcast networks. Now Brussels plans, against strenuous US
objections, to impose similar quotas on cable, satellite and
video-on-request channels.
Tidal wave
The pretext is that Europe's viewers and entertainment industries will
otherwise be swamped by a tidal wave of Hollywood programmes, sold at
knockdown prices because their costs have already been covered by sales on
their large home market. Both the measures proposed to support this policy
and the motivations behind them are indefensible. That Europe's
entertainment industries cannot match Hollywood's scale economies is not due
to some unfair US advantage. It is because European film makers and
broadcasters have been so much less successful than their American
competitors in producing and marketing programmes which appeal to audiences
outside their home countries.
In any case, there is something profoundly impractical about applying 'local
content' rules to a business as international as media entertainment, in
which capital, talent and production resources regularly flow freely across
borders. More preposterous still is the idea that quotas can be enforced on
rapidly proliferating cable and satellite channels, some of which originate
outside the EU's borders.
Sheer power
What is disturbing is that European governments believe the game is worth
playing. The charitable explanation is that they have yet fully to
comprehend the sheer power, scope and diversity of the new media
technologies. Another view is that many of them are motivated less by
high-minded defence of cultural integrity than by a concern with preserving
the capacity for influencing public opinion afforded by control of the
audio-visual media.
If that seems fanciful, note that the French government this week has named
as head of the two state-controlled television stations an interviewer known
for his close links with conservative politicians. And Mr Silvio Berlusconi,
who has skilfully used political connections to help him dominate Italy's
privately owned broadcasting media, has allied himself publicly with Mr
Umberto Bossi, head of the Northern League.
It may be argued that the importance of political control over the media
will gradually diminish, as the choice of alternative delivery channels
expands. The danger is that the more immediate that prospect becomes, the
more extreme will become the measures taken by governments to thwart it.
They may not stem the tide, but they risk handicapping European efforts to
compete effectively on the new media markets. Though it would have benn
unthinkable for the issue to have torpedoed the Uruguay Round, the EU's
stubborn refusal to be nudged towards liberalisation is a reason for sorrow,
not rejoicing.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Few havens in stormy seas: FT writers on the effects on
European exporters of exchange rate instability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FT writers
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European business has had a rough ride into the new world of floating
currencies.
After the succession of crises in Europe's exchange rate mechanism over the
past 15 months, hopes of a smooth transition to a single European currency
have been dashed. Companies have been affected differently by the exchange
rate upsets, which started with the ERM withdrawals of sterling and the lira
in September 1992 and culminated in the forced widening of fluctuation bands
in August. The overall effect, however, seems to have been a deepening of
Europe's recession, now the most severe since 1974-75.
Mr Rutbert Reisch, treasurer at Volkswagen, the German car group, says: 'We
look upon European currencies as a freely floating exchange rate system. We
treat the pound, the lira, the peseta and the French franc just like the US
dollar, the Canadian dollar or the yen.'
In recent days the Belgian and French currencies, underpinned by firm
domestic monetary policies, have returned to the narrow bands of the ERM's
'hard core' that preceded the July-August shocks. But European governments
and central banks reject any possibility, for now, of formally
re-introducing narrow bands, as this would encourage fresh disruptive
speculation.
Although the downturn is bottoming out in the continent's two largest
economies, Germany and France, gross domestic product across industrialised
countries in Europe is likely to grow only 1.5 per cent next year after
contracting 0.2 per cent this year, according to Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development forecasts.
Exporters from countries with devalued currencies, such as Italy, Britain,
Spain and Sweden, have gained competitiveness - helped by the success of
these states in holding down domestic wage costs. Yet for the whole European
economy, these benefits have been outweighed by the negative economic impact
of currency appreciation in Germany and in ERM members still linked to the
D-Mark.
Since Germany is the destination for 20 per cent of the total exports of its
EU partners, this year's estimated 1.5 per cent contraction of the German
economy has hurt Europe.
The effect of low growth on the Continent on British export prospects will
be spelt out on Friday in the Confederation of British Industry's latest
monthly survey. Mr Andrew Sentance, the CBI's economics director, says UK
exporters have often failed to realise hopes that devaluation would produce
sales gains in the rest of Europe. 'The increases in export volume have come
mainly from non-EU areas like North America, Japan and the Far East. The
problem with Europe is that it is not growing.'
Britain's Imperial Chemical Industries, which registered a 15 per cent
increase in exports in the third quarter this year, is one of the few big
European manufacturers to see the currency changes as an unalloyed blessing.
'Increased export competitiveness after the depreciation of the exchange
rate has been our saving grace,' says Mr Richard Freeman, ICI's chief
economist.
German companies, by contrast, have registered sharp declines in
competitiveness. While production costs in Germany have been rising faster
than in most of its trading partners, the D-Mark has registered a real
revaluation of about 9 per cent on a trade-weighted basis over the past two
years.
German exports have become cheaper in the US and other countries linked to
the dollar, thanks to a general fall of all European currencies against the
dollar since summer 1992. But Germany conducts only a small share of its
trade with the dollar area.
A senior Bundesbank economist notes that this is the first postwar German
recession in which increased exports will not be able to lead the recovery.
The revaluation squeeze is the main reason for large job cuts and vigorous
restructuring throughout the German motor, chemicals and engineering
sectors, says Mr Hans-Peter Frohlich, an economist at the Cologne-based IdW
economic institute. 'German industry can cope with the crisis. The big
problem is how society will cope with the effects,' he says.
Amid the general gloom, there are some bright spots. Among the companies to
have profited from exchange rate turbulence, Italian exporters head the
list. The lira's decline has allowed them to draw maximum benefit from a
fall in wage inflation following last year's abolition of the scala mobile
system, under which wage rises were linked directly to inflation.
Mr Stefano Micossi, research director at Confindustria, the Italian
employers' federation, says: 'Devaluation has been extremely beneficial to
Italian industry. Companies with a big export component in their total
turnover are already seeing an upturn. The crucial part was devaluing while
having dismantled wage indexation.'
Italian sales have risen especially sharply to non-EU countries, led by Asia
and Latin America, with exports to China expected to double to more than
L4,000bn (Pounds 1.56bn) this year, representing almost 3 per cent of
Italy's total sales abroad.
But industrialists in countries still linked to the D-Mark have more sober
stories to tell.
KNP BT, a big Dutch paper and packaging group, is feeling the negative
effects of the exchange rate changes in its graphics and information systems
businesses in Spain and Italy. It must compete with big Scandinavian-based
paper companies, which have profited on export markets because of declines
in the Swedish and Finnish currencies.
France has maintained a tight monetary policy since the ERM crisis to keep
as close as possible to the D-Mark. The franc's success in regaining its
narrow-band ERM trading range ranks in Paris as a minor victory for the
government.
Some French executives say, however, that the price of maintaining a firm
franc - the slow pace of interest rate cuts since the August ERM squalls -
has been too high.
The chief executive of a leading French industrial conglomerate complains
that France's interest rates are still too high to allow satisfactory
growth. 'Today we are experiencing the most serious crisis for 50 years,' he
says.
In Denmark - where the National Bank, like the Bank of France, has tried to
maintain a close link to the D-Mark - the strong krone has put pressure on
corporate profits. Carlsberg, the breweries group, reported a 29 per cent
increase in the volume of beer sold worldwide (most brewed abroad) in the
year to September 30. In terms of Danish krone, however, net sales
(excluding excise taxes) increased only 10 per cent, and operating profits
were almost unchanged.
In countries with devalued currencies, too, the corporate picture is far
from rosy. In Spain, the peseta's devaluation has benefited exporters as
well as some domestically orientated companies, such as cement groups, which
have seen foreign competitors forced to increase their prices. But the
peseta's decline has had a negative effect on companies with large foreign
currency debts. Casualties include the electrical utilities as well as Seat,
the Spanish subsidiary of the Volkswagen car group, which has been hit by
heavy losses on its borrowings - almost all in D-Marks.
In view of Sweden's large devaluation since it severed its link with the
European Currency Unit in November last year, Swedish economists reckon the
country's industrial competitiveness has risen by 20 per cent over the last
year. But Swedish exporters have yet to reap the expected rewards. 'The main
reason we haven't benefited as much as we could have done is the recession
in Europe, particularly in Germany,' says Mr Magnus Lemmel, head of the
Federation of Swedish Industries.
Another restraint is that many of Sweden's big multinationals made heavy
investments in the rest of Europe during the 1980s. In many cases, key
elements of production are now based in hard currency countries such as
Germany and France.
For European companies' exports, the integration of the single market can
bring drawbacks as well as benefits. Most members of the EU and the European
Free Trade Association now conduct between 65 and 80 per cent of their trade
with each other - a degree of interdependence which can prove
counter-productive when Europe's economies suffer simultaneous downturn.
According to Ms Frauke Neumann, a trade specialist at Germany's Munich-based
Ifo economic research institute, many German companies are trying to correct
what they see as their 'over-dependence' on the European market.
Ifo says recent indications of brighter German export prospects are based
especially on expectations of revived demand in East Asia, the US and
eastern Europe. The dollar's strength has been an additional factor
prompting German companies to switch their export efforts.
But sales to such regions can give only sporadic hope to exporters trying to
escape recession and currency uncertainties in Europe.
Most European business leaders instinctively favour currency stability as a
means of improving their corporate fortunes. But a precondition for more
settled exchange markets is that governments maintain tough measures to
increase economic convergence. In view of the unpopularity of these
measures, there are doubts, in a number of countries, on how long they will
be maintained. As Europe heads for another year of low growth, there is
little sign that currency stability is about to make a comeback.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: The case against civil service
privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BARRY A. REAMSBOTTOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Most of the press, including yourselves, failed to report the most
significant fact contained in the government's Next Steps Agencies White
Paper review ('Reform boost for Whitehall', December 10). Once again, the 90
agencies have achieved better than the three out of every four tough
efficiency and quality targets set for them over the previous 12 months.
Each year the targets get tougher, but performance continues to improve.
To argue that to have only privatised one area of the civil service
represents a policy failure is to miss the point. What sense is there in
forcibly putting central government work into the hands of private companies
if it can be done more cheaply and efficiently in the public sector? The
success to date of the in-house teams winning market testing contracts
clearly demonstrates that the civil service can compete on costs with the
very best of UK, US and European companies.
Privatisation may well help to satisfy the ideological appetites of some
ministers but what is the benefit to Britain of a greatly reduced civil
service if the taxpayer is actually paying more for those services?

FT  15 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: 'Disaster' for jobs if Thorp not
opened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From DONALD MACGREGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The decision allowing Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant to go ahead is
imminent, as you reported ('Thorp plant to be given go-ahead', December 14).
If it is announced today it will fall by coincidence the day before the
latest unemployment figures are available. The two subjects are critically
intertwined, and at the GMB we are concerned to protect our members' jobs
and the environment within which they work and live.
The consequences for thousands of jobs should Thorp not be commissioned are
frightening in the current economic climate. For Sellafield and west Cumbria
it will be a disaster.
The plant would support 2,100 full-time jobs, with the additional knock-on
effect likely to be the creation of a further 1,000 new jobs. Thorp is a
vital part of British Nuclear Fuel's work at Sellafield and is crucial to
the future of the 8,000 jobs on site.
We hope the government will announce that Thorp can finally go ahead. The
decision to commission would come after the most vigorous and comprehensive
examination of all the issues, not the least of which is safety and the
environmental effects.
At every stage of the Thorp project, from conception and design to
construction and commission, the regulatory authorities have scrutinised and
endorsed the companies' activities.
BNFL is at the cutting edge of new technology, winning jobs and vital
currency for Britain. If the government's claim to support British companies
is to be believed then Thorp must go ahead. The GMB is convinced that all
the evidence shows a positive decision on Thorp is the right one. It would
put BNFL on a sound footing and give the nuclear industry a welcome vote of
confidence.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Tax change forced Scottish plant job
cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER G KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your Article 'US group cuts 200 jobs in Ayrshire' (October 29) misses a
very key point - that the UK and EU governments effectively changed the tax
position of the plant in Scotland.
When Conner opened its plant in 1990, disc drives imported into the EC
attracted a small duty (4.9 per cent). This amount helped Conner cover the
higher costs of production in Scotland compared to plants in the Far East.
Our competitors made several attempts to get this duty removed - finally
doing so via a quota loophole which included imports from certain countries
in Asia where most disc drives are made. We were then left with paying duty
on parts being imported while finished products were imported duty free.
Conner did not get the support it should have from the Department of Trade
and Industry and the Scottish Office to close this loophole or administer
the quota effectively. Conner has committed significant capital, resources,
technology and management time to its operation in Scotland. We also
benefited from a fine workforce. But if a government changes the regulatory
conditions such that higher cost and lower prices result, the business model
on which a plant is founded will no longer hold up.
The real nonsense from the UK taxpayers' standpoint is that they paid to
help set up the plant, then paid for competitive products to be imported
from the Far East.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Little knowledge is a dangerous thing: UK vocational
education is under fire in a new report, write John Authers and Lisa Wood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An employment consultant listening to Mr Kenneth Clarke's announcement in
the Budget that the UK government would introduce a 'modern' apprenticeship
scheme suggested to his wife that their son might like to pursue such a
route.
'My son . . . an apprentice?' she screamed. 'He is bright and will go to
university.'
This kind of traditional academic snobbery is one of the biggest problems
facing British manufacturing today. Deep-seated skills problems threaten to
stifle recovery and leave the UK vulnerable to competition from both
European and increasingly high-tech Asian economies.
A report* published today pinpoints the crisis. It says the system of
vocational qualifications phased in by the government over the past three
years is a 'disaster of epic proportions'.
Professor Alan Smithers and his team from Manchester University's Centre for
Education and Employment concentrate their attack on two reforms: national
vocational qualifications (NVQs), which are work-based and measure an
individual's ability to do a task, and the general national vocational
qualification (GNVQ), intended as an alternative to A-levels mainly for
students in full-time education. Both qualifications - introduced in
workplaces and schools - are based on what a student can do, rather than the
knowledge or theory acquired about a particular subject.
In comments which will intensify the debate between adherents of the new
system and its critics, Prof Smithers claims both NVQs and GNVQs are
inferior to previous training schemes and to comparable European courses.
Response to the report has been swift. Mr Tony Webb, director of training at
the Confederation of British Industry, one of the driving forces behind the
new qualifications, said: 'There is a great deal of misunderstanding about
what NVQs are. To an employer it is what somebody can do that matters.'
In marked contrast, Professor Sig Prais, of the independent think tank, the
National Institute for Economics and Social Research, a noted critic of
NVQs, said: 'The government may now be sufficiently embarrassed in order
that it reconsider the whole system.'
Such a move is highly unlikely despite the fact that training for
16-to-19-year-olds in the UK is unco-ordinated and controlled by different
government departments. GNVQs, for example, are an education department
responsibility, while NVQs come under the employment department.
Both departments are trying to give more status to the new qualifications.
For instance, the apprenticeship scheme announced in the Budget, under the
employment department, will be based on NVQs. Meanwhile, the current review
of the National Curriculum for 14-to-18-year-olds, by Sir Ron Dearing for
the education department, is expected to recommend a stronger emphasis on
GNVQ.
So what has the government been trying to do with its vocational education
standards and provision? Mr Tim Boswell, further education minister said:
'We believe the broad structure is right and that we can build on it to have
a really powerful range of qualifications.'
Nevertheless the problem is plain. Britain's workforce is under-educated and
under-qualified. Only 18 per cent of the UK workforce, for example, is
qualified to craft level - skilled carpenters for example - whereas in
Germany the figure is 56 per cent, France 33 per cent and the Netherlands 38
per cent.
Other international comparisons are revealing although direct contrasts
along the lines attempted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (see accompanying graph) are difficult because countries use
different training schemes.
Prof Prais points out that the German figure for 16-to-18-year-olds in
full-time vocational educational is swollen by the numbers of apprentices on
the country's 'dual scheme', who spend most of the week with their employer,
spending only one or two days at a college.
However, his own figures also rank the UK's vocational provision low
compared with its main economic competitors. He says that 64 per cent of the
British workforce has no vocational qualifications, compared with 26 per
cent in Germany, and 23 per cent in Switzerland.
An awareness that there is a shortage of skilled workers has forced the
government to rethink vocational education. It has sought to establish three
routes into the world of work for young people: a work-based route built on
NVQs; the GNVQ (now renamed 'vocational A-levels' by the education
department); and the 'A' level.
An effective, competence - based qualifications system is critical to
reform, the government believes. But here is the rub - deciding what amounts
to competence pits academics such as Prof Smithers against business bodies
such as the CBI.
According to Prof Smithers, the educational theory of NVQs 'is loosely
derived from behavioural psychology, and argues it is what people do that
counts, their competence (to perform a task)'. Examiners assume that what
pupils know or understand can be inferred from what they do.
By contrast, Prof Smithers and other conservative academics believe that
both practical ability and trainees' theoretical grasp of their tasks must
be tested. In most European countries, trainees take practical and written
examinations, both of which must be judged acceptable by external examiners,
before they can gain a qualification.
The added theory can be vital, critics of the current system claim. One
college lecturer suggests that a young NVQ-qualified craftsman could build a
brick wall, but 'because he had never been taught about the effects of
freezing weather on water, he would not know what to do when it was cold,
and neither would he know what to do in hot weather. So your wall would
probably fall down within a couple of years.'
Testing on the continent is also more rigorously linked to the needs of the
workplace. In Switzerland, for instance, trainees lose marks for taking more
than a fixed time to complete work, and must produce consistent quality.
Prof Prais says that in the UK, examiners are more concerned to ensure
candidates can reach a certain standard - not necessarily that they do so
consistently - and do not set a time limit for the work.
According to Prof Prais: 'It's vital for the economics of production for
someone to be trained to do something reliably and punctually. We have given
up testing for that kind of thing.'
A National Institute study of workplace practices in Europe found serious UK
inadequacies which could be attributed to training:
Machinery maintenance was found to be routine on the continent, but in
Britain was left to smaller 'firefighting' teams of qualified craftsmen.
Normal machine operators did not understand how to practise good
maintenance.
In the clothing industry, qualified German workers could reach an efficient
working speed on a new garment within three days, while an English worker
would typically take three weeks.
On this evidence, British employers seem sorely let down by the education
and training system. Even though they may recruit workers who are competent
in their immediate tasks, they will not in the long run have a workforce
with a broad range of flexible and competitive skills.
Changing the system to satisfy their needs along the lines identified in
Switzerland and Germany requires both clarity of government objectives and a
recognition by employers that their best interests lie in a deeper
commitment to high-level training. Prof Smithers report shows that consensus
on the way forward is as far away as ever.

Sir, Nigel Andrews ('Why videos are not so nasty'. December 3) seems to be
sure that no extremes of violence, horror, evil or vice portrayed on screen
in the home can harm anybody except, perhaps, 0.1 per cent of the viewers,
who, he admits, might imitate what they saw. Of some 50m, that is rather a
lot of people.
His argument that all the evils of society should be represented in our
culture is at least debatable. Represented how, and to whom? Adult
intellectuals may be unharmed or, indeed, enlightened by literature that
could put evil ideas into more feeble-minded folk and would cause children
to act out undesirable situations. Few would deny that Jude the Obscure
offers what Nigel Andrews might call cultural insight, but would he like
small children to watch, on the screen, one child hanging two others and
then himself behind a bedroom door? And that very act, in the story, was, as
the doctor said, because a child had seen the terrors of life before he was
old enough to have the staying power to resist them.
Whatever the argument about censorship, it must be obvious that the screen
in the home throws enormous responsibility upon parents, many of whom are at
least careless, if not thoughtless or even feckless. A caring society should
bear them and their children in mind as well as being concerned with
intellectual freedom. Perhaps Nigel Andrews has had less experience with
children than your ex-teacher correspondent Diana Schomberg (Letters, same
date).

Sir, If the parliamentary timetable is so tight that the government is
obliged to introduce guillotine motions to ensure the passage of its
legislation this week and the opposition has decided to withdraw pairing
co-operation ('Labour halts co-operation with Tories', December 10), why is
parliament starting its Christmas recess on December 17, one week before
most of the rest of the country commences its Christmas holiday?

FT  15 DEC 93 / All is not yet lost: Russia's democrats can still prevail if
their nerve does not fail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'It would be quite wrong,' said Mr Quentin Davies, MP for Stamford and
Spalding, 'for me as a foreign observ-er to express a preference for one of
your political parties over another. But of course we are all delighted that
you have chosen the democratic path.'
'Yes,' said the lady who was counting ballot papers at the Palace of Culture
in Serpukhov, about 100km south-east of Moscow, in the small hours of Monday
morning. 'But I wonder for how long.'
This is a question many people inside and outside Russia have been asking
themselves, since Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the authoritarian nationalist
leader who has the nerve to call himself 'Liberal Democrat', emerged as the
main winner of Sunday's election. His will be the largest single party in
Russia's first freely elected parliament, and the combined forces of
nationalism and communism will outnumber those firmly committed to
democracy.
The stakes are raised by President Boris Yeltsin's success in winning
approval for a constitution that vests sweeping powers in the presidency.
Those powers will be dangerous enough, some think, in Mr Yeltsin's hands.
How much more so if Mr Zhirinovsky were to emerge as his successor.
Ominously, perhaps, Mr Zhirinovsky was the one opposition leader who
supported the new constitution.
But all is not yet lost. Everything depends on how Mr Yeltsin uses his new
powers. He modelled them deliberately on those of the French president,
though in some respects they go further. Most notably, he now has the power
to 'issue decrees and executive orders' which 'shall be binding throughout
the territory of the Russian Federation'. The only limitation is that they
may not contravene the constitution 'or federal laws'.
The constitutional court - composed of 19 judges appointed by the upper
house of parliament - has power to declare presidential decrees
unconstitutional.
But it is only if they have the effect of introducing martial law or a state
of emergency that they require direct approval of the upper house.
The constitution follows the French rather than the American model in that
the government, though appointed by the president, must enjoy the confidence
of the lower house of parliament, called the State Duma. The prime minister
can only take office with the Duma's consent. The government, once formed,
serves at the president's pleasure, but if the Duma expresses its lack of
confidence in the government twice in three months, the president must
either dismiss the government or dissolve the Duma.
Mr Yeltsin has given himself the right to dissolve the Duma and call new
elections if it rejects his candidate for prime minister three times. The
right to dissolve after a no-confidence vote does not apply in the first
year of a new parliament's life.
In theory this gives the newly elected parliamentary majority the power to
force Mr Yeltsin to 'cohabit' (a la francaise) for at least a year with a
government that enjoys its support.
In practice, this will not happen, because there will not be a parliamentary
majority in that sense. Mr Zhirinovsky is far from being in a position
comparable to that of Mr Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist leader who was able to
impose his own choice of prime minister on President Francois Mitterrand
after winning this year's parliamentary election in France.
Even in the half of the Duma elected by proportional representation, using
party lists, Mr Zhirinovsky's party will be far short of an overall
majority. And things will be much less clear in the other half, elected by a
single ballot in single-member constituencies.
In Britain, there are long-established and highly organised parties with a
firm base of public support, giving a strong advantage to the leading one or
two parties and accentuating polarisation. But in Russia parties are new and
hardly organised. In Sunday's election most constituencies had many
candidates, very few of whom advertised a party affiliation on the ballot
paper. Voters appear to have been either unaware of such affiliations or
uninfluenced by them.
So even if Mr Zhirinovsky forms a close alliance with the communists and
agrarians (which is by no means guaranteed) he will still not command a
majority unless he can win over a broad swathe of deputies who have no
strong party affiliation, mandated mainly to defend local interests.
It may be weeks before the balance of power within the Duma becomes clear,
and even then it will be a shifting one. The skills required for analysing
this phase of Russian democracy will be those of historians like Sir Lewis
Namier, who analysed 18th-century British politics in terms of the local,
family and business connections of individual MPs, or Sir Ronald Syme, who
by collating a variety of sources laboriously identified the bit players in
the turmoil of the late Roman republic.
In a contest for the votes of independent or semi-independent members, a
strong executive is at a great advantage, even without a strong party base
of its own, as monarchs from George III to Bill Clinton could attest.
Let us hope Mr Yeltsin makes good use of the powers he has given himself -
or rather that the people have now given him. Let us hope he resists the
temptation to try to co-opt Mr Zhirinovsky, or to compete with him in 'Great
Russian' chauvinism.
We should know, by now, that fascism only thrives on appeasement. Mr
Zhirinovsky remains eminently beatable, if democratic Russians do not lose
their nerve.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Public finance must lure private
funding to transport network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From FRANCISCO L BORGES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As a US market leader in insuring municipal bonds, we would endorse the
comments made in your editorial, 'A mega-bond for London' (November 29),
that the issue of bonds secured by future revenue streams could be the
answer to the capital's transport infrastructure problems.
However, our experience suggests government should recognise that, in most
cases, public finance up front would be required to attract private
investors. Bond finance could come in after one to three years of operation
when a track record of revenue streams and a credit rating for the issuing
body had been established.
A number of 'live' projects is required to develop a senior bond market for
long-term debt. Therefore, the chancellor's budget announcements on
development of private finance initiatives are a welcome step, although a
firm foundation for the ground-rules needs to be established.

Does it matter that many of the programmes made under BBC2's Bookmark
umbrella have been so good that the series has now won the right to make
programmes in which the 'book' content may be a bit hard to find? No it
doesn't. Excellence is always to be welcomed, and anyway there is invariably
some bookish connection. For today's programme they took Israeli writer
David Grossman into the Occupied Territories on the day after Israel
recognised the PLO to discuss the moral aspects of the Arab/Israeli conflict
(8.00).
Crime Story has not been the greatest series of its sort, but today's 'real
life' episode is a memorable one. When clothes belonging to Labour
politician John Stonehouse were found on a Miami beach some assumed he had
committed suicide, but others said 'Who's he trying to kid?' Sure enough, he
had sloped off to Australia and was later brought back to face trial (9.00
ITV).
In Stark Ben Elton, writer adaptor and star of this story about businessmen
scheming to take over the world, is still trying to get the celibate Rachel
into bed (9.25 BBC2).

FT  15 DEC 93 / Arts: Joan Cross - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD CRICHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The soprano Joan Cross, one of the most distinguished singers since the
first world war, has died at the age of 93 in London. Born in 1900, she
studied under the composer Holst. She then graduated from the Old Vic chorus
to small solo parts before becoming leading soprano at the sister-theatre,
Sadler's Wells. This phase of her career culminated in 1945, when she sang
Ellen Orford in the first production of Britten's Peter Grimes.
Joan Cross remained closely associated with Britten, as a founder member of
the English Opera Group formed in 1946 and as the creator of a succession of
leading roles in his operas - the Female Chorus in The Rape of Lucretia,
Lady Billows in Albert Herring, Queen Elizabeth in Gloriana (at Covent
Garden), Mrs Grose in The Turn of the Screw. She worked as opera producer in
London, Holland and Norway and, with Anne Wood, founded the Opera School
(later National School of Opera) in 1948.
In praising all she did at a time of operatic consolidation in Britain there
is a danger of overlooking Cross's excellence as a singer of the standard
repertory. In Mozart her Fiordiligi and in Verdi her Desdemona must serve as
just two admirable examples of her use of an English-type soprano voice
under masterly control with quiet but unmistakable authority.
She was not a glamorous performer, but her sense of style, respect for words
and music and sharp intelligence were ample compensation. In a wartime
Beggar's Opera her gin-soaked, tatterdemalion Mrs Peachum revealed a gift
for character acting not fully exploited. She was awarded a CBE in 1951.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Now that BBC1's hugely enjoyable series To Play The King has ended (with all
the pieces neatly stored in position for a third story as soon as Michael
Dobbs can write it) will BBC2's Stark take its place as the weekly drama
treat we look forward to? Probably not. Stark, adapted by Ben Elton from his
own novel, and starring Elton as the sex-starved nerd who stumbles across a
conspiracy to pollute and take over the world, looks good enough: the
Australian locations and the cast are more than adequate. But there is
nothing here to compare with Ian Richardson's virtuoso performance as 'FU',
the vulpine politician in To Play The King. Furthermore, Elton's story,
which seems to be a sort of green thriller, carries little conviction either
as a thriller (it feels like a parody) or as a piece of environmental
campaigning. Elton may genuinely feel strongly about such matters as toxic
waste, but that is not the impression you get from Stark. His character's
desire to get long legged mini-skirted Rachel into bed is much more
convincing.
In the end it was Michael Ignatieff's bottomless reservoir of liberal
understanding that was the undoing of Blood And Belonging. Of course
sympathy for the refugee, the widow, the persecuted minority is admirable
and perhaps even a necessity if you are to gain access and complete your
series when your subject is nationalism. But given how appallingly
destructive the mindless love of landscape has proved over so many
centuries, given the insane vehemence with which people fight, even unto
death, for the sake of a few folk songs, unconvincing fairy stories and
embroidered waistcoats (all right, 'national costume') it is surely the duty
of a man with Ignatieff's intelligence to take a somewhat sceptical view of
nationalism.
'All very well for someone secure in his own culture and country to be so
dismissive', you may say, but it would seem to me as sensible (or, rather,
as stupid) to die for the Apennines and Catholicism as for the Chilterns and
morris dancing. Ignatieff spent his time listening sympathetically to people
from Croatia to Canada who were only too eager to pour out their
totalitarian bile for his cameras. Perhaps he would have made fewer friends
but showing a little more anger at the futility and destructiveness of this
attachment to myths and mountains would have made for a better series.
Rhodes Boyson on Clive Anderson Talks Back: 'Mrs Thatcher was a tremendous
person. I liked her very much. You could bounce golf balls off her without
her noticing'.
Do television producers bother to watch their own programmes prior to
transmission ? If the answer is yes, then perhaps they should try watching
them on the video recorders in their own homes rather than on professional
studio equipment. The thought is prompted by this week's 'Performance' drama
on BBC2: The Changeling. All the viewers I have spoken to have said the same
thing: thanks to the 'background' music, foreground sound effects, and the
actors' insistence on mumbling, it was difficult and sometimes impossible to
hear the lines, at least in the early part of the play. If this was obvious
to viewers why not to the professionals? Either they believe that the music
and sound effects are more important than the words, or they are so familiar
with the text that they do not notice the words cannot be heard. Or they
just do not care. Whatever the reason, it is time someone high up in the
broadcasting world did something to stop the slide towards the inaudible,
not only in television but, ludicrously, in radio too.
It may also be time for someone to tell Bob Hoskins, who played De Flores,
that there are more ways of expressing emotion than widening your eyes while
gritting your teeth together and flailing your lips around. If he has
nothing to replace this limiting and amateurish habit, he should be told to
go and watch Anthony Hopkins' performance in The Remains Of The Day which
provides a masterclass in the facial expression of emotion without words.
Alan Yentob, Controller of BBC1, has a nice sense of humour. If you had said
last week that it was possible to produce an Omnibus documentary about the
death of Tchaikovsky which would make Ken Russell's movie The Music Lovers
look quite restrained, most people would have laughed like drains. Yet John
Purdie and Anthony Holden managed it. As alternatives to the standard yarn
about the composer dying after drinking a glass of water from the cholera
tainted river (the version favoured by previous biographers including
Russell) Holden offered two other possibilities: that he was ordered to
commit suicide by a kangaroo court of old-boys from school because of his
homosexuality, or that he contracted cholera from one of St Petersburg's
rent boys. Yentob's little joke was to screen The Music Lovers immediately
after the Omnibus. Thus we could watch Andrew Faulds, MP, shamelessly over
acting, and Glenda Jackson, MP, in a nude scene that was long and
melodramatic even by Russell's standards.
For anyone with a more than recreational interest in television, it is worth
catching at least one episode of Channel 4's new Monday night police series
Homicide since it will probably prove seminal without ever being awfully
popular. The theme is entirely conventional: stories of a group of over
worked detectives, this time in Baltimore. It is virtually impossible today
to make an American police series which does not owe debts to Hill Street
Blues, and sure enough Homicide interweaves the stories of various
detectives and teams of detectives; moreover the attitudes and
idiosyncracies of individuals are as important as the plots. Last week
producer/director Barry Levinson kept the entire episode inside the precinct
room, with the air conditioning broken down, a challenge which looked more
like a student exercise in script writing than a real attempt to entertain
the viewer.
It is the style, however, which is likely to be copied elsewhere. Levinson
is using all sorts of techniques from journalism and sport to make Homicide
look different. When people talk the camera is often hand-held, creeping
right round them or swinging jerkily from one to another, as in a
fly-on-the-wall documentary. During interviews he will fade to black instead
of mixing or cutting. Every now and then he throws in a multiple-image shot,
a bit like that famous photograph of a golf swing showing the club in all
360 degrees of a circle, or simply repeats a shot quickly while the dialogue
continues. Much of it looks like tricksiness for its own sake, but it also
looks undeniably different and it will be a surprise if other programme
makers do not follow suit.
It turned out that If You See God Tell Him was not a situation comedy at
all, but a situation tragedy. We should have guessed from the length of the
episodes (45 minutes) and the absence of a laughter track that something was
afoot, but what fooled us were the writers: we knew Marshall and Renwick
from Hot Metal and Alexei Sayle's Stuff and assumed they would give us more
comedy. Actually Godfrey Spry, absolute believer in the literal truth of the
advertising slogan, stood revealed in the last (delayed) episode as a truly
tragic figure, tried and convicted for a murder he did not commit.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Arts: Je regrette 'Piaf' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I missed the two great musical flops in London: the Norwegian Which Witch at
the Piccadilly last year and Eurovision which has just closed after a
near-record short run at the Vaudeville. They can hardly have been worse
than Piaf, which deserves an even shorter run at the ill-fated Piccadilly.
To be accurate, Piaf is not quite a musical. The piece has been around for
some years, but not in such a big theatre. Here it is described as 'a
musical play', written by Pam Gems, starring Elaine Paige and directed by
Sir Peter Hall. Although Piaf may suggest an evening of song and nostalgia
for things French, Piaf the woman had an interesting life in interesting
times. It is conceivable that there is a good play to be written about her.
This is not it. A warning notice in the Piccadilly foyer should have warned
us off. The show, it says, contains 'strong language'. Here is a random
example (from Alexander Pope) of strong language at its best: 'Yet let me
flap this bug with gilded wings, This painted child of dirt that stinks and
stings'. There is scarcely a word in it that would offend on its own, yet
the overall effect is lethal. To the Peter Hall/Mary Whitehouse school
(birds of a feather) 'strong language' means boring, repetitive swearing.
How standards have slumped]
One four letter word is used, I think, only once. 'Who wants some little
cunt looking like a war widow?' says Paige's Piaf, 'when they could have
Doris Day?' Unfortunately it misfires. The natural reaction to this
production is to think that a preference for Doris Day any time is
absolutely right.
Swearing is not the only gratuitous element. Piaf may not have been
well-educated, yet she must have spoken a more interesting and attractive
French argot than the painful English with which she is here afflicted. The
point about Piaf was that she could sing and did it in a French that carried
around the world, just like Marlene Dietrich in German. It must have been
quite difficult being French or German in the early 1940s, and having to
live with the consequences afterwards. To reduce Piaf to some kind of
inarticulate Lancastrian cockney is a huge disservice to a woman whose songs
and spirit we shall continue to admire. This is the very worst kind of
patronising English insularity.
Other gratuitous acts include sex and violence. At the start there are some
silly simulations of the sexual act, which are done much better and more
suggestively in the current production of Cabaret at the Donmar Warehouse.
Violence is served on a plate. People kick each other in the groin and hit
each other on the face at the first opportunity. Some of it may be intended
to be funny. Yet you do not need to act out violence in full: only suggest.
One sympathises with Ms Paige for wanting to play the part. She is a fine
actress who can belt out a song. But someone should have deterred her from
this production: Peter Hall, perhaps? Incidentally 'Je ne regrette rien'
which finally comes after two and a half hours, is a wonderful number, but
if you think about the words only a fool could believe in them. There should
be a lot of regrets about this Piaf.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thank heaven for stories and storytelling; and for theatre and
theatricality. The New Adventures of Pinocchio, with which the Mermaid
Theatre has just reopened, has virtually nothing going for it except that it
tells a story its audience (average age 2-10) wants to follow, and tells it
in a way that could only be achieved by live theatre. No adult should go
unless accompanied by at least one child; but, for those that do, there is
some delight to be had in studying the way it works upon the tinies.
The staging, directed for Parasol Theatre by Richard Gill, makes blunder
upon blunder. When the puppets 'speak', it is obvious that 'their' voices
are spoken by adults - both amplified and muffled to boot. One actor hollers
his lines - a bore, but audible. Another fails to project hers: prettily
inaudible. A third speaks his in a fake Italian accent so thick that even
the grown-ups have to do some deciphering. Several of the lines are too
literary to make sense to the kids. Pinocchio is said to be a puppet without
strings, but we see both strings and puppeteer. These mistakes puzzles the
children and their attention wanders.
Yet never for long, because they want to know what will happen next; or,
rather, they want to know that the story will work out the way they have
been told it works out. Also because, though the characters have been far
better depicted by Disney and in books, there is innocent fun to be had in
watching how live theatre brings off such things as Pinocchio's nose growing
or shrinking; or the sea-voyage out from Naples harbour; or Pinocchio and Pa
battling in the waves. Not to mention how the whole tale is told by a cast
of five, with puppets, dance, mime, and the staple panto routines of
'Be-hind you]' and 'Oh-yes-you-are]'
I would like nonetheless to say there must be better things than this in the
West End for young children this Christmas. But are there? True pantomime
these days only occurs outside the centre of our capital. I worry about
this, for Christmas is a perfect time in which to introduce kids to live
theatre in all its multi-layered fun. Suitable fare for kids should be more
widely on offer in town. But if you feel that your child is too young for
rock musicals or Roald Dahl, and unsuited to the sublime theatrical fantasy
of ballet, then Pinocchio it will have to be.
At the Mermaid Theatre, EC4, 071-410-0000. Until January 8

If the Philharmonia has been popping champagne corks, it is keeping them
quiet. For all the speculation it seems politic to wait until the Arts
Council formally announces its verdict on the funding for London's
orchestras, a decision which has widely been reported to favour the
Philharmonia.
For the time being it is business as usual. On Monday, that entailed a
Russian concert at the Royal Festival Hall, where its main rival, the London
Philharmonic, is orchestra-in-residence (but for how long?) The programme
offered the popular coupling of Rachmaninov and Tchaikovsky, while there is
still the excuse that it is a commemorative year for both of them. (The BBC
documentary on the mysterious circumstances surrounding Tchaikovsky's death
will have been fresh in people's minds.)
There was just one work by each. Of the pianists that I have heard playing
Rachmaninov's Third Piano Concerto recently, Vladimir Ovchinikov is the one
best equipped to tackle the concerto on the scale it demands. He has the
notes, including the long cadenza, and judges the balance with the orchestra
well. He is not too barnstorming like Donohoe, not over poetic like Hough,
never just the dextrous technician.
Unfortunately, it is those negative virtues that one comes away with at the
end. If only he could be more daring expressively, Ovchinikov might
communicate more of what he feels about the music. It might seem ungenerous
to say so, after he had laboured so diligently for nearly an hour, but it
was only Yevgeny Svetlanov's brazen whipping-up of the final orchestral
climax that brought the concerto triumphantly sailing into port.
Svetlanov is one of the musical world's showmen. His performance of
Tchaikovsky's Fourth Symphony was flamboyant and colourful, uncomplicated in
its assessment of the issues the symphony addresses. None of that 'What did
Tchaikovsky die of?' nonsense for him. Svetlanov's Tchaikovsky is in the
grip of raging high blood pressure and exhibits a dangerous excess of red
corpuscles.
Asked to play boldly and loudly, the Philharmonia has no trouble delivering
the goods. It could even play the last movement with panache at the speed
that Svetlanov wanted. But there is limited sensitivity to colour and
internal balance in the orchestra's playing, of the kind it will need to
show if it is to live up to the 'international first division' reputation
being thrust upon it. The Philharmonia needs an experienced orchestral
trainer at its head. Its choice of new Music Director, due to be announced
as soon as the Arts Council is ready, will be crucial.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Business and the Environment: Prevention is better than cure
 -Frank McGurty on the changing US approach to pollution control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Why then has the US
Environmental Protection Agency only recently begun to examine ways of
reducing industrial pollution before it is produced?
Many of the reasons can be found in a joint study released last month by the
EPA and Du Pont, the chemical company. The project, which identified ways to
minimise waste generated at a New Jersey chemical plant, is perhaps the best
illustration to date of how the US approach to pollution control is
evolving.
The collaboration began in February 1991. As part of a settlement over
violations at its Chamber Works plant in Deepwater NJ, Du Pont agreed to pay
a fine of Dollars 1.8m (Pounds 1.2m). More significantly, its deal with the
EPA included an undertaking to examine how to reduce wastes at the facility
and to make its findings available to competing chemical producers and
research organisations.
Two important conclusions emerged. First, prevention is much more effective
than traditional 'end-of-pipe' remedies, which usually simply transfer
hazardous waste from one medium to another - say, from water to land fills.
Second, pollution prevention - or 'source reduction' - can cut operating
costs, improve product quality and boost profitability.
When all of its recommendations have been implemented at a one-time capital
cost of Dollars 6m, Du Pont expects to save about Dollars 15m a year, with a
reduction of up to 73 per cent in hazardous waste from the processes
selected for study.
Traditionally, the EPA has favoured sticks over carrots. Its mission had
centred on assuring compliance with federal regulations through a system of
permits, inspections and enforcement actions.
The focus was on rigid rules and equipment specifications, which are often
based on outdated technical data. Amazingly, pollution generated by
individual industrial sites was often neither measured nor analysed.
Last spring, a study conducted by the EPA and Amoco at its oil refinery in
Yorktown, Virginia, revealed that neither party knew the source of dangerous
benzene emissions there.
Nevertheless, the EPA had required the company to spend Dollars 41m on a
system to capture benzene vapours from pools of waste water, known as
separators.
The real problem, the study found, was fumes escaping when oil was loaded on
to barges. EPA rules, based on data compiled in 1959, did not address the
loading process, and Amoco complacently accepted the agency's
short-sightedness.
'The system encourages companies to put in place managers who know the
regulations and how to comply with them,' says Kevin Mills, an attorney with
the Environmental Defence Fund, a private non-profit making group. 'This
priesthood of specialists typically acts very conservatively, in
well-documented, safe ways.'
Tension between regulators and the regulated is an even more formidable
obstacle. Source reduction, the Du Pont study suggests, is incompatible with
the antagonism that seems to flow from the EPA's traditional role as
policeman.
The study 'recognises that the best environmental solutions come when
government establishes priorities and realistic goals, and when industry
accepts the responsibility of meeting them in the most efficient way,' says
Paul Tebo, Du Pont's vice-president for safety, health and environment.
The EPA first compiled a list of 33 chemical processes at the plant, which
produces about 650 products using 4,000 chemicals. The company was free to
select 15 of them and develop its own recommendations on cutting the waste
they generated.
Some of the solutions which Du Pont put forward involve subtle refinements
of complex procedures. In examining a process that produces nitroaromatic
compounds, the assessment team initially focused on a single step. Later, it
concluded that only a series of small improvements to all of the process's
flow-control systems would result in substantial waste reduction.
The lesson for other companies is that waste-minimisation assessments must
often be expanded beyond their original scope. In many cases, only close
scrutiny of the entire process can lead to effective action.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Business and the Environment: Japan divided as Thorp waits -
Tokyo's green lobby claims Britain will become a dump for nuclear waste
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It may not be the most palatable of messages, but it is one that Tadatoshi
Akiba, a member of the Japanese parliament's environmental lobby, is keen to
spell out. 'I think we have the obligation to tell the British people that
it is inevitable for the UK to become the storage place for Japan's nuclear
waste and plutonium,' he warns.
Akiba is one of nine parliamentary members urging the review of Japan's
contracts to reprocess used nuclear fuel at the Pounds 2.8bn thermal oxide
reprocessing plant (Thorp) in Sellafield, north-west England. The group
claims the global surplus of plutonium and the international trend away from
fast breeder development will eventually force Japan to curtail its nuclear
policy. They warn that under the current contract, British Nuclear Fuels,
the plant's owner, may end up holding stockpiles of unprocessed nuclear fuel
and plutonium if Japan decides to curb plutonium use.
Ahead of the British government's imminent decision on the future of Thorp -
it is expected to give the go-ahead - there have been claims and counter
claims about the project's viability from Japan, Thorp's largest foreign
client. The official line of the Tokyo government over its commitment to
Thorp and to its plutonium reprocessing programme, remains unchanged. But
the environmental lobby is using Thorp as a chance to highlight the
complications facing Japan's nuclear policy.
Japan's electric power utilities have already shipped 2,300 tonnes of used
nuclear fuel to Sellafield to be processed. According to Akiba, BNFL is
required to check whether Japan can actually use the processed plutonium
before it is shipped back. Hence, if Japan ends up with too much supply or
decides to curb its nuclear energy policy, Thorp will end up with unwanted
plutonium. He also says the contract stipulates that BNFL will lose its
right to send back the plutonium to Japan after 25 years. However, BNFL says
there is no time limit on the return of plutonium.
Some questions surrounding Japan's stance will be answered at the end of the
year by the country's Atomic Energy Commission, when it ends its sixth
mid-term reassessment discussions on Japan's long-term nuclear policy.
Meanwhile, the electric power utilities refute the environmentalists'
claims. Kohji Kaneko, general manager of the Federation of Electric Power
Companies' nuclear power department, says BNFL would have the right to
decide how to dispose of the unprocessed used nuclear fuel, plutonium, and
nuclear waste: this could include sending it back to Japan. 'It's
unthinkable that BNFL would sign such an one-sided contract,' he says.
Yasutaka Moriguchi, the director in charge of Japan's nuclear fuel policy at
the Science and Technology Agency, strongly denies the possibility of a
change in the country's nuclear programme in the future. The country's
plutonium policy was drawn up by officials in the late 1950s when they
discovered it as a 'dream energy source' which was ideal for a country
lacking energy resources and dependent on imported fuels.
Japan's goal of becoming completely self-sufficient in energy was reinforced
by the oil crises of the 1970s; the country relies on oil and uranium
imports for more than half of its electrical power. Since then, the
government has introduced nuclear power aggressively, allowing 42 nuclear
power plants to be built over the last 20 years, and has stood by its
plutonium policy on the assumption that uranium would be scarce and
expensive in the future.
However, uranium prices have plunged following discoveries in Canada and
Australia and a decline in demand for uranium. Some analysts believe the
world's uranium supply will last for another 130 to 150 years. Uranium and
plutonium from the deactivated nuclear weapons of Russia and the former
Soviet republics have added to the glut of nuclear fuel.
Japan currently has 4.5 tonnes of plutonium, of which the environmental
lobby claims that there is no planned use for three tonnes. The government
denies any possibility that Japan's nuclear policy will be altered. It also
claims that it does not have a plutonium surplus and the demand and supply
situation match up. By 2010, Japan will have 85 tonnes of plutonium of which
22 to 33 tonnes will be used in fast breeder reactors, 10 tonnes in added
thermal reactors and 50 tonnes in light water reactors.
Moriguchi says critics of Japan's nuclear programme are short-sighted. 'Of
course, we can't use the whole 4.5 tonnes now because we haven't built all
the plants yet. But it takes more than 20 years to build one nuclear power
plant.'
He argues that the current global oversupply of uranium and plutonium is
temporary: 'Some 1,000 tonnes of uranium is only four to five years worth of
global demand.'
Fears of Japan making nuclear weapons with the plutonium are unfounded, he
says, since its nuclear programme is closely examined by international
inspectors.
Kaneko also expects a sharp rise in demand from developing countries which
are increasing their reliance on nuclear energy in the near future. 'Since
Japan's goal is to be completely self-sufficient, Japan wouldn't buy from
outside even if there is a glut,' says Moriguchi.
He points out that Japan will not drop its plutonium development plan as
other leading western countries, with energy resources, have done. 'We're
not like the US or UK which have energy resources like oil and coal in their
own countries.'
Critics counter such arguments that the plutonium cycle cannot be sustained
with additional uranium to create the fuel. Atsushi Sakurai, a physics
researcher, says Japan cannot free itself totally from having to import
uranium. For instance, if Japan - for any conceivable reason  - broke off
ties with the US, its main supplier of uranium, nuclear power stations using
plutonium would only run for five years.
Meanwhile, there is evidence that the electric utility companies have
started to drag their feet due to the cost of building new nuclear plants.
The chairman of the Federation of Electric Power Companies recently
announced the delay of construction of the demonstration fast breeder
reactor planned for the late 1990s. Analysts expect this in turn to delay
commercial use of fast breeder reactors until after 2020.
The companies are spending more than Y1,200bn (Pounds 7.5bn) for the
construction of Rokkasho, a complex in northern Japan, which includes
nuclear waste storage, enrichment facilities, and a planned reprocessing
plant.
So what are the chances of Japan shifting its nuclear energy policy? The
environment lobby says that due to mounting international fears of nuclear
proliferation, a logical conclusion would be for Japan to scale down its
plans. Under the new coalition government, including leftist parties which
formerly opposed nuclear power, Japan could well shift its policy.
However, the administrators will probably try to avoid the embarrassment of
announcing a complete change in stance and, at best, will officially
postpone the current schedule.
One indication of what could happen may be gleaned from Mutsu, Japan's first
nuclear-powered vessel, mothballed after a radiation leak on its maiden
voyage in 1974. After strong public opposition to a further test voyage, the
decision to scrap the project last year forced the government to admit to
failure on reaching a national consensus on nuclear energy.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Jobs: Unreal dreams . . . and other sacrifices - Two
contrasting viewpoints on the failure of theorists to chart the route to
social progress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One thing the Jobs column has marvelled at these past 20 years is that
people as busy as you readers find time to glance through it at all. So it
is probably tempting fate to start its last appearance before January by
recommending books for you to pore over in the meantime.
But, even at the risk of seeming bumptious to boot, that is what it is going
to do. The reason is that the scarcely credible changes which have lately
overtaken the world we work in are still far from fully appreciated, and the
two tomes in question go a fair way towards driving them home.
Take for example the demise of planned economies. Their failure to match up
to the market-driven kind seems to strike most people as clear disproof of
the socialist theory that co-operation could triumph over competitive human
nature. But few of us apparently recognise that the same human foible is
just as much an obstacle to the theory of free trade.
One of the rare exceptions is the American author Edward Luttwak. His latest
book argues that, while the break up of the Soviet Union may have ruled out
military war between top nations, they are sure to go on battling with each
other for industrial dominance, and it is only those armed with effective
industrial policies that will be able to provide worthwhile jobs for large
chunks of their population.
Companies from the winning nations will buy up the losers' best outfits,
transferring senior posts to their own home lands. Elsewhere, the highest
hope for most natives will be a middle-management job in a group run
colonial-style from abroad.
Moreover, although the book's title is The Endangered American Dream1, Dr
Luttwak makes clear that the danger he fears is not confined to the US.
Indeed the country he holds up as a warning is Britain, which he thinks has
already sacrificed much of its hope of prosperity to theoretical dreams of
free trade.
But the onslaught on such theories is taken still farther by the other book
called Shame and Nececessity2 which, despite being less immediately relevant
to workaday issues, is at least as good a read. Its author is the
philosopher Bernard Williams, and his focus is the really ancient Greeks -
those who lived before the heyday of Socrates in the fifth century BC. - who
he thinks offer us important lessons, not least because their very different
ideas of morality were by no means inferior to ours.
Among other things, they were less reluctant to face the fact that might is
often in effect the same thing as right, and were better at persuading
holders of power that obligations go with it. For example, those seen to
have misused their power did not expect to get away by keeping their
admissions to the minimum feasible, and adopting a lower profile. The
accepted penalty was a public display, not of mere guilt, but of shame which
in the extreme case demanded suicide.
In short, the oldest Greeks believed that the tolerable running of a society
is dependent on the will of individual citizens to act morally - a view
which has since been superseded by theories that social progress depends on
suprahuman forces, such as Marx's dynamics of history and Adam Smith's
invisible hand.
Professor Williams argues that the theories have failed to serve as an
adequate substitute for the personal moral code of the pre-Socratic Greeks.
But his belief that we have much to learn from them doesn't extend to
advising us to re-adopt their principles entirely, which the Jobs column
thinks is in some ways a pity.
Misuses of power strike me as on the increase, and if it takes shamings to
curb them, so be it. Certainly I'd prefer to stop short of obliging
offenders to shed their blood. But that would at least make for a more
dignified mode of exit than the quiet acceptance of a few thousands from
tax-payers' funds, with which sacked British ministers apparently soften
their downfall nowadays.
Finally this year to the more seasonal topic represented by the table to the
right, which gives a guide to the cost of acquiring and trying to escape
from a hang-over in 18 international centres. The figures have again been
not just supplied, but double checked, by the Runzheimer consultancy of
Rochester, Wisconsin.
First comes the acquisition stage: the local prices of a litre apiece of
particular although undisclosed brands of whisky and of vodka, followed by
the average price of both as the 'on-cost'.
The next four columns cover the attempt to escape: 100 branded aspirin, 36
Alka Seltzer (except in Tokyo and Cairo where they are apparently not on
sale), and half a pound of instant coffee, which are also averaged out as
the 'off-cost'.
The final column lumps the on and the off together to give the total damage
. . . to the pocket at any rate.
Which said, I wish you all the compliments of the season, and hope to meet
you again in the first week of January.

FT  15 DEC 93 / People: Miles to become Barings' joint deputy chairman
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If you are 57 and have been the Taipan of one of Hong Kong's biggest trading
houses, it hardly seems worth starting a second career.
But Michael Miles, an executive director of the family-owned John Swire &amp;
Sons, obviously feels that the sixth decade of life is ample time for a new
start; he is about to become a full-time merchant banker.
Miles, who started with Swire in 1958, has spent most of his life in the
Pacific basin.
He was chairman of John Swire &amp; Sons (HK) between 1984 and 1988 and is also
a former chairman of Swire Pacific and Cathay Pacific, Swire's two biggest
quoted subsidiaries.
Early next year he becomes a joint deputy chairman of Barings, alongside
Andrew Tuckey, 50, which means that Miles will be joint number two at
Britain's oldest merchant bank.
A non-executive director of Barings since 1989, Miles is not a banker but
sat on the board of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation during his
time as Swire's Taipan.
Although he is only six months younger than Baring chairman Peter Baring,
who is expected to hand over to Andrew Tuckey in a couple of years time,
Miles hopes to be in his new job for 'three to four years'.
He will continue as a director of John Swire &amp; Sons and will retain 'certain
specific Swire group executive responsibilities'.
Barings' decision to add a well-connected outsider to the team of four
executive directors running the group underlines its ambitions in an area
where old contacts are often just as important as bright ideas.
More than a quarter of its 3260 staff are based in the Pacific basin. One
rival merchant bank speculated that Miles had been hired as a 'high-powered
door opener' rather than for his managerial skills.
Barings and Swire appear different but share similar characteristics. Both
grew out of firms of family merchants which started trading at the start of
the 18th century.
Although Barings is better known in the City, the Swire group is much
bigger. In its last financial year it made pre-tax profits of over Pounds
600m on turnover of Pounds 3.6bn and along with its associates employs
74,000 people.

FT  15 DEC 93 / People: Builder constructs new GrandMet financial path
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gerald Corbett, Redland's 42-year-old finance director, right, has been
headhunted to join Grand Metropolitan, a company with a market
capitalisation more than three times that of Redland. The food and drinks
group's share price fell 13p to 445p, while the building materials stock
came off a more modest 6p to 577p.
His appointment follows a surprise re-shuffle in September, as a consequence
of which George Bull was promoted to chief executive of GrandMet and David
Nash, the previous finance director, moved up to become head of all food
operations.
Corbett describes himself as a 'pre-active, open and communicative ' finance
chief, who has steered Redland through 'the worst recession in the
construction industry in the UK this century'. He points proudly to
Redland's 'financial ratios which are some of the best in the sector, a
gearing ratio of 30 per cent and interest cover of 8 times'.
He has been in the post six years, and is only four years younger than
Redland's chief executive, Robert Napier. By contrast he is eight years
junior to the next youngest member of the GrandMet board. 'Yes, GrandMet is
a lot bigger,' says Corbett, 'but that is what it is all about, isn't it?'
Corbett came to Redland from Dixons, where he had been director of corporate
finance. Before that he had worked as a management consultant with Boston
Consulting Group. He has an MBA from London Business School.
Though evidently surprised at the fall in the share price yesterday, he was
not prepared to comment directly on the market's view of his appointment.
He says Redland will look outside for his replacement; he will probably
leave after the annual results in March, at which time his successor will
'hopefully' be in place.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Management: Facing up to responsibility - In a second
article on 3M, Christopher Lorenz describes reactions to its European
reorganisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Stig Eriksson and Peter Williams report that most people are delighted
to be given greater responsibility and power, with more independence from
their boss, they might seem to be stating the obvious. But the two European
managers of 3M, the diversified US multinational, have also found that
others 'are uncomfortable, and need to be coached', as Williams puts it.
The type of response depends partly on the person's character and
experience, but also often on their nationality, adds Eriksson. People from
relatively authoritarian cultures such as Germany, France and Italy, tend to
be unsettled by being allowed considerable autonomy, and can take longer to
get used to it.
Eriksson and Williams, who are at the heart of a radical reorganisation of
the 21,000-person European operations of 3M, have experienced both types of
reaction from their staff this year.
The reorganisation, which took effect in January, has transferred most
business responsibility from separate country subsidiaries to a network of
19 pan-European divisions - what 3M calls 'European Business Centres'.
As a result, many managers in individual countries now report direct to
European bosses, often in a different country and several hundred miles
away. About a thousand managers have been affected directly.
Most of the structural changes have already been made (see FT Management
page, November 10). But Eriksson says all sorts of team-building and other
'change processes' are still under way in order to get people 'really to
accept cultural diversity, and make it a strength'. With different
nationalities now reporting to each other across borders, all sides must
work hard at developing their relationship.
A number of other 'rough edges', as 3M's top man in Europe, Doug Hanson,
calls them, are also having to be smoothed out.
Most of 3M's new Euromanagers have reacted positively to the changes, in
spite of the heavy travel involved. Their enthusiasm is epitomised by the
views of three of them: Fabio Barcellona , a 34-year-old Italian who now
shuttles across Europe from his office in Milan; Clare-Noelle Bigay, a
29-year-old Frenchwoman who does the same from near Paris; and Reza Vaziri,
a 40-year-old Italian-Swiss who has moved from Switzerland to near
Dusseldorf in Germany. He is one of the few to have been relocated.
Barcellona , and Bigay work several levels below Eriksson, a Finn who is the
Brussels-based managing director of 3M's medical products business, while
Vaziri is a couple of levels below Williams, the head of 3M abrasives,
located west of London.
Barcellona, marketing supervisor for 3M's line of sterilisation products,
attributes its 15 per cent sales growth in this recession-torn year mainly
to the reorganisation: 'It's given people new motivation, from marketing
teams down to the sales forces and dealers - it's contagious'.
Bigay agrees, saying the change is already creating such cross-border
cohesion that a new product which she is helping launch across Europe this
month 'would have taken another year previously, because the countries
worked individually'.
As an experienced manager, Vaziri was used to operating with a considerable
'power distance' in his native Switzerland, from where he moved late last
year to run the German sales and marketing operations of one of 3M's
abrasives businesses. His German predecessor in that job reported to a
fellow national on the same site as himself. But Vaziri's boss is a
Frenchman based near Paris.
Vaziri says he is entirely happy with the new arrangement. He talks to his
new boss once a week on the phone, and they meet more or less monthly,
usually alternating between Dusseldorf and Paris. 'That's actually more
often than I saw my boss in Switzerland,' he says. One of the main reasons
why 3M has had relatively little trouble putting the reorganisation into
practice is that there was a growing consensus at all levels that the
previous structure was in need of change.
Among the old cross border consultation processes was a widely publicised
system called 'European Action Management Teams'. These teams helped plenty
of new product ideas to be exploited across borders, but always relatively
slowly. Williams says they were more forums for debate than platforms for
action.
'It was extremely difficult to get enough knowledge and commitment across
frontiers. One had to do things through product directors in Brussels who
didn't have full authority to get things done,' adds Eriksson. So giving
European tasks to managers in any single country 'was very difficult. They
were judged by their local results, so they had to do it like 'church work'
 -in their spare time'.
Expanding on why the old organisation hampered 3M's responsiveness to the
customer, Eriksson says: 'Europe is definitely consolidating, through
alliances of customers and of distributors. Dealers are getting together
every day in office equipment, pharmaceuticals, health care and other
areas.'
Yet 'we didn't do a good job of key account management', says Hanson, 'there
was no central responsibility'.
Williams recalls 3M's difficulties when a large oil company wanted to
refurbish 5,000 sites across Europe. 'It was a major problem getting
everyone harnessed behind it,' he says.
Another problem was that 'we didn't have good control of pricing policy',
Hanson adds. One country would go for price rather than volume, and its
neighbour for the opposite. 'So distributors complained, and bought across
the border.' He says the problem was most important 'for the confusion it
created'.
As well as being more effective at serving multinational customers and at
transferring local skills across borders, the re-organisation is helping 3M
get new product ideas into the marketplace much more rapidly. 'These days we
expect roll-out times to be cut by 50 per cent,' says Eriksson.
Such improvements are coming in spite of the difficulty of redesigning
various information systems as fast as the organisation has changed.
Hanson's outstanding list of 'rough edges' includes:
The need to clarify new procedures following the shift of spending authority
from countries to businesses.
The development of guidelines for the cross-border harmonisation within
businesses of recruitment, remuneration and other personnel practices. These
are all relatively clear for sales and marketing jobs but not for staff
ones. 'That's an issue we haven't resolved yet,' says Hanson. 'I guess I
wasn't forward-thinking enough to see it as a problem.'
The development of 'a bit of a silo mentality' within individual European
business units, which in some cases is reducing the effectiveness of what 3M
calls 'related selling': the sale by one business unit of another's
products. 'That was easier to do within individual countries than it is all
across Europe,' says Hanson.
By no means every part of the organisation is experiencing all these
problems. Frederico Gavioli, a 30-year-old Italian, who is part of the pan
European 'core team' for biomedical electrodes and has special
responsibility for several European product launches, says: 'We're sharing
our resources much better than we used to - we no longer duplicate between
countries. And everyone here is used to change. To be a 3M person you must
live with it.'
What about the risk - inherent in any pan-European organisation - of losing
touch with national markets? Gavioli and other junior and middle managers
say this has been avoided by their retention of national marketing
responsibilities alongside their new European ones. As one of them says:
'The key to this is that I still have local customers on the phone every
day, as well as people in other countries.'

FT  15 DEC 93 / People: Vereker moves to ODA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The game of musical chairs at the top of the education department has
produced another surprise move, with the appointment of John Vereker,
formerly the department's head of schools, to become permanent secretary of
the Overseas Development Administration.
He succeeds Tim Lankester, who is moving to head the education department
following the controversial departure of Sir Geoffrey Holland to become
vice-chancellor of Exeter university.
Vereker, 47, cut his teeth in the education department's more controversial
jobs, serving as the first chairman of the Student Loans Company,
established to start the gradual replacement of student grants with loans.
He also defies Whitehall stereotypes by being a graduate of Keele
university, albeit one who was previously educated at Marlborough college.
Vereker graduated with a combined honours degree in English and political
institutions.
He now becomes one of Whitehall's youngest permanent secretaries, and
presumably has a chance of moving eventually to be permanent secretary of
the education department - both Lankester, and Sir Geoffrey's predecessor
Sir John Caines moved to that job from heading the ODA.
Sir Geoffrey remains sphinx-like about why he left the education department
after less than a year. He moved there after five years as permanent
secretary at Employment, and favoured merging his old department's
responsibilities for training with the education department.

tells Judy Dempsey of his attempts to help fellow 'Ossis' with their
presentation

<TEXT>
When the Berlin Wall came down, Torsten Schlingelhof quit the stage, folded
his jazz band, and moved to Berlin from his native Weimar. But he quickly
tired of his jobs in the capital. What disappointed him most was the way
east Germans presented themselves.
Schlingelhof decided to do something about it. 'I saw the way in which they
lacked self-confidence,' he explains, 'and how they were unsure about how to
deal with the opportunities which opened up before them.' Schlingelhof and
his friend Jutta von Brunkau started their image advice consultancy, Atmeum,
in February last year.
'The east Germans have found it difficult to cope with the changes,' says
37-year-old Schlingelhof. 'For 40 years, they were not allowed to express
their individualism publicly. They had to act in a collective way. But in
their heads, they were individuals. I want to draw out this individualism. I
suppose I try to provide a bridge between the collective mentality and
individual self-expressionism.'
Schlingelhof's method, like his manner, is informal and relaxed. His
clients, mostly women aged between 30 and 55, can register for an individual
course or in groups.
'I first ask my clients what they do, and what they want from life. The
answer is invariably the same,' says Schlingelhof. 'Many of them are
professional women. Before unification, they were working as lecturers,
teachers, or art historians. Their jobs were secure. Now they have to
compete in the market economy. They all want self-confidence, particularly
when they apply for a job, but they do not have the tools to achieve this.'
With his staff of six, including Wilfried Markert, a retired voice teacher
at east Berlin's renowned Schauspielschule, Schlingelhof advises on
deportment, dress, style, and how to articulate with confidence. Business
has not been particularly brisk - about 350 people have passed through his
doors - but as Schlingelhof explains, 'our clients are shy about coming'.
Half of them are from west Berlin, according to Schlingelhof. 'I believe
that in west Germany, you are not meant to admit that you lack
self-confidence.'
Katharina Gruhl, a 30-year-old west Berliner who runs her own management
consultancy agency, approached Schlingelhof 'because I wanted to project
myself. Atmeum has given me great self-confidence'.
Gruhl is surprised that Schlingelhof is an Ossi, or Easterner. 'He is so
untypical of the Ossis. He is confident. But I realise that by going to the
studio, I can learn about how the Ossis think as well. That is very
important for breaking down the mental wall between the Wessis and the
Ossis.'
Schlingelhof feels both bemused and irritated when Ossis or Wessis discover
he is an east German. 'Some Wessis have this image that the Ossis are from
another planet. Indeed, I had a lot of difficulty in obtaining a bank loan
largely because the banks were suspicious because I was an Ossi. They
distrusted me because I had no previous record in running a business. But we
have to start somewhere.'

Shanks &amp; McEwan, the waste management company whose share price has nearly
halved since early October, has found a new finance director. David Downes,
47, finance director of Hunter Saphir, the fresh produce distributor, joined
the company yesterday.
He replaces Alastair Fowler, 55, whose surprise resignation on October 1,
helped precipitate the collapsed share price. The company said that Fowler
retired early because he did not want to move down South as the company
relocated its headquarters from Scotland. However, the combination of his
abrupt departure, followed by poor interim results, led to a sharp drop in
the Shanks' share price. Following yesterday's announcement the share price
rose 5p, to 92p.

Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the Financial Reporting Council, is stepping

His replacement is expected to be announced shortly by the Department of

Sir Ron, who was chairman of the Post Office Corporation in 1981-87, will
still be very actively occupied by his other commitments, including the
Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority.
He was persuaded to take on the Financial Reporting Council, a body of his
own making, since he chaired the official 1988 report which recommended the
creation of a new machinery for accounting standards-setting and

FT  15 DEC 93 / Terror reinsurer collects Pounds 100m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pool Re, the specialist terrorist damage reinsurer set up after commercial
insurers withdrew from the market, has collected more than Pounds 100m in
premiums, it emerged yesterday.
More than 159 insurers have been admitted to the scheme and a further 75
applications could be accepted by the end of the year, the company said.
The apparent success of the new arrangement comes after earlier threats by
insurers that they would refuse to support it.
It also suggests that the government's contribution as a backstop on claims
for terrorist damage that Pool Re cannot support will be minimal.
Insurers expressed concerns in the summer about the structure of Pool Re,
and over a lack of consultation with the sector by the DTI.
Mr Keith Loney, company secretary, said that Pool Re now had Pounds 100m
invested. Substantial additional amounts would be provided by insurers by
early in the new year.
He said Pool Re had so far paid out only Pounds 29m on claims relating to
the Bishopsgate bomb in April. He estimated the total could be Pounds 300m.
Pool Re also expects claims from the Bournemouth bombing in August of about
Pounds 2m.
The first set of accounts for the company will not be published until
spring, but Mr Loney said its annual administrative costs were less than
Pounds 1m. Pool Re last increased its premiums - which are passed on at the
same rate by the insurers to policyholders - in July. Mr Loney said
Commercial insurers would absorb the first Pounds 100,000 in claims before
Pool Re paid out.
The NatWest Tower in the City of London, damaged by an IRA bomb in April
this year, is to be refurbished next year.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Ofsted criticises curriculum tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The national curriculum tests which were boycotted last summer by teachers'
unions in England and Wales were 'too burdensome for effective teaching',
government inspectors said yesterday.
Teachers' unions said the report vindicated their industrial action and
predicted that they would win enough concessions to call off their dispute.
The report by Ofsted, the education watchdog, confirmed union claims that
less than 5 per cent of state secondary schools took the tests last summer.
It added that there were 'significant failings' arising from the complex
structure of the tests, and that the tests in English for 14-year-olds,
which aroused strong and widespread opposition, were 'flawed'.
It recommended a cut in the range and number of assessments across the
curriculum.
The government stressed the report's few positive findings. Baroness Blatch,
education minister, said it 'provides further confirmation that the
assessment arrangements are raising educational standards'.
But she admitted that the curriculum had become too prescriptive and
difficult to manage, and said the government had already agreed to cut
testing and marking times for seven and 14-year-olds by 'roughly a half'.
The National Union of Teachers said government concessions needed to go
further. Mr Peter Smith, of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said:
'Ofsted are absolutely right. Educational standards cannot rise until the
bureaucracy is reduced.'

FT  15 DEC 93 / Ford extends Christmas shutdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thousands of workers at the Ford Motor Company are being forced to start
their Christmas holiday earlier than usual because of falling demand for its
products in continental Europe.
Today will be the last production day for Ford assembly workers at the
Dagenham works in east London except for those working in the engine plant.
This will mean a loss of 13 shifts over seven days. Production will not
restart at Dagenham until January 5.
The company said yesterday that the early shutdown was partly caused by
plans to carry out changes to the production lines to improve the safety of
Fiesta vehicles.
Workers at the company's Halewood plant on Merseyside will not work tomorrow
or on Friday, in line with the three-day working that started last month. At
Southampton and Bridgend workers are also being compelled to take more
shifts off this week in addition to their Christmas break.
Although the workers will be paid basic rates during the break they will
lose shift premiums and bonuses during the extra six days off work. It is
estimated this will mean a cut of 10 per cent in pre-Christmas earnings for
many of Ford's manual workers.
Mr Jimmy Airlie, chief Ford negotiator for the AEEU engineering and
electrical union, said: 'Ford's action reflects economic realities. Britain
is still deep in recession.'
At Vauxhall's Luton plant the production line will stop for an extra four
days after the December 22 to January 4 break, restarting on January 10. The
company's Ellesmere Port plant will return to operation on January 4.
The Rover Group and Peugeot Talbot said yesterday that they would be taking
a normal Christmas holiday - from Christmas Eve until January 3.
Sales of Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars are unlikely to exceed 1,500 a year -
compared with a peak of 3,333 in 1990 - 'for the foreseeable future', Mr
Michael Donovan, commercial managing director of the Vickers-owned carmaker,
said.
But with the company's break-even output, including big provision for
research and development, down to 1,300, it is viable, he said.
Mr Donovan said that the prediction made in the summer by Sir Colin
Chandler, Vickers' chief executive, that Rolls-Royce would return to
profitability this year - after running up total pre-tax losses of Pounds
110m in 1991 and 1992 - was being borne out by the level of year-end sales.
He said Rolls-Royce's financial performance was being boosted strongly by
the unexpected success of the Pounds 170,000 Bentley Continental coupe
model. Sir Colin has said that in the long term Rolls-Royce would need to
find some form of partnership to develop a new generation of models.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Ulster move sparks hope and dismay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Early reaction to yesterday's breakthrough in efforts by Mr John Major and
Mr Albert Reynolds, the British and Irish prime ministers, to agree a joint
declaration on Northern Ireland was mixed.
There was anger and bewilderment in the Ulster Unionist party. Mr Chris
McGimpsey, the UUP honorary secretary, said: 'We will not prejudge the
declaration, but it will be quite outrageous if a secret deal has been done
behind the backs of the people of Northern Ireland.
'We are the largest political party in Northern Ireland and we have been
kept in the dark. We are at a complete loss and don't know what is going
on.'
Mr David Trimble, UUP home affairs spokesman, said the 'only' question was
whether Mr Major had stood by the democratic rights of the people of
Northern Ireland. Anything that undermined these rights would be 'badly
received'.
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, said last night that it would
consider any agreement between the British and Irish governments. Mr Tom
Hartley, the party's national chairman, said: 'Both Mr Major and Mr Reynolds
know what is required to bring about a lasting peace.'
Mr Peter Robinson of the hardline Democratic Unionist party said: 'There is
nothing in the agreement capable of stopping loyalist paramilitary activity
nor is there anything to the advantage of the unionist community - it cannot
therefore bring peace.'
Mr Mark Durkan, chairman of the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and
Labour party, said he welcomed the indications that the two governments had
made progress.
'We have always recognised that the two governments have a range of
responsibilities and opportunities which don't obtain for other parties such
as ourselves. The more the two governments can seize such opportunities and
discharge such responsibilities together, then the better for everyone.'
Mr Kevin McNamara, shadow Northern Ireland secretary, said he wanted to know
if what the two governments had agreed would bring an end to 'warfare' and
'be acceptable to both communities'.
Mr Ken Maginnis, the UUP's security spokesman, said: 'If the two governments
could with one voice underpin the principle of consent for the people of
Northern Ireland then the terrorists would be left with no claim to
justification. I don't think it would be worth making a statement if they
couldn't do that.'
Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, was upbeat on prospects for peace.
He said: 'It will be a balanced declaration, threatening no one's interests,
and there is no hidden agenda by either government.'

FT  15 DEC 93 / Day of frantic telephone diplomacy brings accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was a day of frantic telephone diplomacy.
By the time Downing Street aides summoned lobby journalists to a remote nook
of the Palace of Westminster at 8.11pm to signal that a declaration had been
agreed - bar a few uncrossed t's and undotted i's  - prime minister Mr John
Major and his Irish counterpart had spoken twice. Some of their officials
had been on the line far more frequently.
The result was confirmation that the Major-Reynolds roadshow, which had
taken in Brussels, Dublin and Brussels again in little more than six weeks
would reconvene - they hoped in triumph - in London today.
The language the aides used was still cautious. 'Some details', they said,
had still to be 'sorted out'. But it was clear that - barring an
extraordinary setback - the two premiers will today unveil the long-promised
joint declaration that they hope will pave the way for peace.
The cautious aides 'expect' the prime minister to brief MPs on developments
in the afternoon.
The prime minister's day of detailed, last-minute haggling on Ulster started
about 10am when he met Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, Mr Michael
Ancram, Northern Ireland minister, Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary,
and others. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, was in
Belfast.
At 10.25am the first 15-minute phone call between Mr Major and Mr Reynolds
took place. Some square brackets cordoning off sensitive areas of text in
the unfinished declaration were rubbed out.
But more remained to be done. It was decided that the two leaders would have
to speak again later in the day.
In the meantime Mr Major had to deal with prime minister's questions in the
House of Commons where, curiously, the situation in the province did not
crop up - although the Rev Martyn Smyth, the Ulster Unionist MP for South
Belfast, made a dogged and unsuccessful attempt to catch the Speaker's eye.
The second conversation came about 4pm. Some progress was made in the course
of a 'constructive' 10-minute exchange. But not enough. Aides were saying at
4.30pm that a third conversation between the leaders might be necessary.
This turned out to be pessimistic. Officials were able to clear enough of
the remaining logjam for the lobby journalists to be summoned.
Mr Reynolds will arrive at Downing Street at 11am today and - perhaps - make
history.

and Tim Coone report on industry leaders' opinions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business leaders in Northern Ireland expect an economic boost to the
province's economy if there is peace, and are ready to see concessions made
in talks that could later include Sinn Fein.
These are the overall findings of a Financial Times survey published today.
It is a rare snapshot of the attitudes of Northern Ireland's businessmen and
women on the political situation and the paramilitary violence in the
province.
Since the troubles began 25 years ago, the business community has in the
main kept its political views private for the good reason that its factories
and offices, or the executives themselves, could become targets of the
paramilitaries.
A majority of the companies insisted on completing questionnaires
anonymously. A handful of those contacted by phone, however, volunteered to
expand on their answers.
One senior executive said of devolution: 'This is absolutely necessary
because without it we will never have the politicians with the calibre we
need to lead us.'
Another commented: 'If the management of a business had been in conflict
with its trade unions for 25 years, that business would have gone under a
long time ago.
'My advice to the politicians is that they must sit down together and talk,
and talk and talk, because that way you can always find there are ways of
moving forward.'
Only 4 per cent of executives said they had ever considered relocating to
the mainland because of the violence, although the chief executive of one
leading employer in the province admitted that relocation had been
considered.
Virtually all said that the violence had not significantly affected the
day-to-day running of their businesses. But they all saw an economic
dividend in prospect if there were peace, with 90 per cent anticipating a
positive effect on business and entrepreneurial opportunities.
They differed more on the precise new structures that would maximise this
peace dividend. Only 5 per cent would continue with the present political
structure while 57 per cent wanted stronger devolved power structures and 27
per cent wanted stronger north-south links. Only 4 per cent saw the best
economic prospects in a united Ireland.
On the political level the respondents were divided in assessment of the
likelihood of a settlement, with optimists roughly matching pessimists.
They also disagreed
about the extent of the concessions that should be offered to achieve a
settlement. About two-thirds of the executives thought neither the IRA nor
the loyalist paramilitaries could be defeated militarily.
Yet a third supported acknowledging the aspiration of Irish unity, and 61
per cent would concede enhanced north-south structures for economic
co-operation.
But only 20 per cent would back such structures for enhancing political
co-operation and 14 per cent were against any of these concessions being
made.
Ninety-five per cent would allow Sinn Fein to the negotiating table: 7 per
cent immediately; 29 per cent as soon as the IRA announced it would abandon
violence; and 59 per cent after a substantial period of non-violence.
Just as encouraging for the nationalist position was the fact that 61 per
cent supported the position taken by Dublin that there should be separate
referendums for north and south.
Only a tiny minority of companies feel Sinn Fein should be indefinitely
excluded from the political process.
The survey covered most of the leading private-sector employers in Northern
Ireland. The respondents together account for almost 25 per cent of the
workforce employed in the private sector.
It was conducted on the basis of strict confidentiality. Nevertheless, the
fear of retribution from paramilitary groups was given as the reason for not
participating by 10 companies. Such nervousness - one multi-national
authorised its local senior executive to participate in the poll only after
a tortuous series of consultations at board level - suggests that the survey
may underestimate the extent to which businessmen and women in Northern
Ireland consider themselves threatened by terrorism.
The chief executives of 80 companies were approached, of which 56 responded.
Many said they were taking part in order to contribute to the current
political debate.
Overall, almost a third of their business is conducted with mainland
Britain, almost 40 per cent within Northern Ireland, a quarter overseas, and
only 7 per cent with the Irish Republic, broadly reflecting the pattern of
trade in the province. The poll was carried out on Thursday and Friday of
last week.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Soldiers injured in bomb attack
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two soldiers were slightly injured last night in a bomb attack on a foot
patrol near the army's main base in Londonderry. The attack came on the day
that the Northern Ireland Office released figures showing that spending on
law and order will edge closer to Pounds 1bn next year.
Proposed spending for 1994-95 will amount to Pounds 931m, compared with
Pounds 902m for 1993-94 and Pounds 912m pencilled in for next year under
original plans.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said next year's total -
which excludes the cost of the heavy army presence in the province -
reflected the priority he attached to defeating terrorism.
He said: 'It saddens me to see the substantial resources which, year after
year, are consumed in our fight against terrorism.'

FT  15 DEC 93 / Production begins of hatchback Carina E
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Toyota yesterday started production of a hatchback version of its Carina E
saloon at its Burnaston plant near Derby, John Griffiths writes.
The new model will account for half of the plant's output, which is to rise
to 100,000 units next year from 37,000 this year.
Toyota Motor Manufacturing (UK) said the rise would lift the company's
spending with its 200 European suppliers to Pounds 380m next year from
Pounds 100m this year. The rise is partly due to European content rising
ahead of schedule.
Mr Yukihisa Hirano, the company's managing director, said that local content
would reach 80 per cent by the end of next year, about six months ahead of
schedule. It has risen from 60 per cent when the plant came on stream last
December to 70 per cent, the company said.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Sensing centre to be probed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Remote Sensing Centre, a part of Britain's space establishment
which was privatised last year, is to be investigated following a report by
the National Audit Office, the government's spending watchdog, Daniel Green
writes.
The report, published yesterday, says that the centre, majority controlled
by British Aerospace, could have a 'privileged position' because it may be
able to take competitive advantage of the close links it still has with the
British National Space Centre, a government agency.
The BNSC is expected to start its costing and pricing investigation into the
sensing centre soon.
The sensing centre, which made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 389,000 on sales
of Pounds 4.1m last year, said it was aware that other space-sector
companies were wary of its position but any fears were unfounded. It said it
would, however, re-examine its costing and charging schemes.
The NAO report broadly praised the UK's space policy.

Toyota yesterday began production of a hatchback version of its Carina E
saloon at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
The new model will account for a half of the plant's output, which is to
rise to 100,000 units in 1994 from 37,000 this year.
Toyota Motor Manufacturing (UK) said the output rise would lift the
company's spending with its 200 European suppliers to Pounds 380m next year
from 1993's Pounds 100m. The steep rise is partly because 'local' - European
 -content is rising ahead of schedule.
Mr Yukihisa Hirano, the company's managing director, said that local content
will reach 80 per cent by the end of next year, about six months ahead of
schedule. It has risen from 60 per cent when the plant came on stream last
December to 70 per cent now, the company said.
About Pounds 50m is being spent with Toyota's 80 components and 20
raw-materials suppliers in the UK this year, rising to Pounds 190m in 1994.
The Burnaston plant is recruiting 500 more employees in readiness for the
start of a second shift in February, lifting it close to the 1,700 envisaged
for full phase-one production of 100,000 cars a year.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Research says aggression possible result of games addiction
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Many young people become aggressive as a result of being addicted to
computer games, with some spending more than four hours a day in simulated
armed combat, research presented yesterday at the London conference of the
British Psychological Society shows.
A survey by psychologist Dr Mark Griffiths and Mr Nigel Hunt, from Plymouth
University, suggested that one-in-five teenagers was addicted to such games.
They said: 'Approximately one-in-five players admitted to aggressive
behaviour as a direct result of their playing.'
Only five out of the 387 children aged 12 to 16 surveyed had never played
computer games. Almost one in three played every day, and almost half played
most days.
One in three believed games were addictive, while 20 per cent said they were
expensive. Some 3 per cent admitted playing truant to play games, while just
over 7 per cent admitted obtaining bad school marks because of their
playing.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Curriculum tests rapped by Ofsted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The national curriculum tests which were boycotted last summer by teachers'
unions in England and Wales were 'too burdensome for effective teaching',
government inspectors said yesterday.
Teachers' unions said the report vindicated their industrial action and
predicted that they would win enough concessions to be able to call off
their dispute.
The report by Ofsted, the education watchdog, confirmed union claims that
less than 5 per cent of state secondary schools took the tests last summer.
It added that there were 'significant failings' arising from the complex
structure of the tests, and that the tests in English for 14-year-olds,
which aroused strong and widespread opposition, were 'flawed'.
It recommended a cut in the range and number of assessments across the
curriculum.
The government stressed the report's few positive findings. Baroness Blatch,
education minister, said it 'provides further confirmation that the
assessment arrangements are raising educational standards'.
But she admitted that the curriculum had become too prescriptive and
difficult to manage, and said the government had already agreed to cut
testing and marking times for seven and 14-year-olds by 'roughly a half'.
The National Union of Teachers, the largest teachers' union, said government
concessions needed to go further. Mr Doug McAvoy, NUT general secretary,
welcomed the report's findings as proving that the teachers' dispute had
been educationally and not politically motivated and said: 'The government's
so-called slimming down of the tests for next year will be as inaccurate as
their so-called slimming down in the past has been.'
The other two teachers' unions held out more hope of a resolution. Mr Peter
Smith, of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said: 'Ofsted are
absolutely right. Educational standards cannot rise until the bureaucracy is
reduced.'
Mr Nigel de Gruchy, of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of
Women Teachers, said Ofsted had 'hit the workload nail on the head'.
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said the report confirmed
Labour's belief that national testing was 'an overload'. She said: 'Mr
Patten has attempted at every opportunity to force through an overloaded,
overprescriptive syllabus and highly bureaucratic testing procedure.'

FT  15 DEC 93 / Rolls-Royce 'viable' with sales of 1,500 cars a year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sales of Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars are unlikely to exceed 1,500 a year -
compared with a peak of 3,333 in 1990 - 'for the foreseeable future',
according to Mr Michael Donovan, commercial managing director of the
Vickers-owned luxury car maker.
But with the company's break-even output, including substantial provision
for research and development, down to 1,300, it is viable, Mr Donovan said.
The prediction made in the summer by Sir Colin Chandler, Vickers' chief
executive, that Rolls-Royce would return to profitability this year - after
running up total pre-tax losses of Pounds 110m in 1991 and 1992 - is being
borne out by the level of year-end sales, Mr Donovan said.
The company last made a profit, of Pounds 32m, in 1990.
He disclosed that Rolls-Royce's financial performance was being boosted
strongly by the unexpected success of the Pounds 170,000 Bentley Continental
coupe model, which is said to account for 20 per cent of output.
The company's 'standard' model, the Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit, sells for
about Pounds 100,000.
Sir Colin has said that in the long term Rolls-Royce Motor Cars would need
to find some form of partnership to develop a new generation of models. Mr
Donovan said it was possible that future model developments would be
achieved through a number of partnership projects.
He indicated that, in the longer term, the company could make wider use of
aluminium, new lightweight steels and possibly even diesel engines to
accommodate energy and environmental concerns.
Given the pace of diesel engine development, 'one should never say never
when it comes to one being fitted to Rolls-Royce'.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Mutinationals give Budget response
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Multinational companies have given a muted reaction to the Budget, a survey
by accountant Ernst &amp; Young shows.
Nearly three-quarters thought it would make it neither easier nor harder for
them to conduct business. Almost half said the Budget left their level of
confidence in the UK economy unchanged while 38 per cent said it had
increased.

FT  15 DEC 93 / MPs rap Revenue on inheritance tax stance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Inland Revenue was criticised yesterday by the Commons public accounts
committee for failure to impose more stringent penalties against inheritance
tax fraud and negligence, Andrew Jack writes.
MPs on the committee called on the Revenue to review the level of penalties
and ensure that they were sufficient to provide 'a just remedy and an
effective deterrent'.
They said it was unsatisfactory that under the present arrangement the cost
of producing evidence of fraud was often considered too high to justify the
effort because of the low value of penalties.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Accounting standards changes planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Accounting standards-setters will produce proposals for changes to the
reporting of pension-fund costs and deferred taxation during the next few
months, the Financial Reporting Council's annual review said yesterday,
Andrew Jack writes.
The Accounting Standards Board, a subsidiary of the council, will also
examine related-party transactions and the treatment of associates and joint
ventures as part of an ambitious programme.
The review shows that the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the accounting
watchdog controlled by the council, considered 45 cases in the past year, as
well as 19 cases outstanding at the start of the year. Eleven were not
pursued, and there was action on 42 of the remaining cases.
Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the council, says in the review that financial
reporting is being taken seriously by all company board members.
A number of 'corporate disasters' had shown the need for financial reporting
to serve shareholders, creditors and employees better, he says.
The review rejects any suggestion that the Accounting Standards Board is
focusing on balance sheets at the expense of profit and loss accounts, or
moving towards a system of current-cost accounting.
It says the board will revise its process for ratifying statements of
recommended practice developed by outside bodies, with new sub-committees to
consider proposals in financial services and for non- profit-making
organisations.
It adds that the board will ask early next year for comments on the
operation of its first financial reporting standard on the cashflow
statement and will consider amendments.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Generators to learn their fate: Electricity regulator may
refer two leading power companies to MMC early next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Professor Stephen Littlechild, electricity industry regulator, is expected
to make a long-awaited statement today on the UK's two largest power
generators but is unlikely to reach a final decision on whether to refer
them to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Although he has previously promised to make a decision on National Power and
PowerGen by the end of the year, it is likely that he will give them about a
month to respond to demands in his statement.
That would open up the possibility of a referral to the commission in the
early part of the year. Any delay will deepen the uncertainty over the
government's plans to sell its 40 per cent stakes in the companies in the
next financial year. The holdings are worth in excess of Pounds 3bn.
Prof Littlechild promised in the summer to make a decision on referring the
generators after sharp rises in prices in the electricity wholesale pool
through which power is traded in England and Wales.
He had already been examining their costs and profit margins.
The regulator's action followed widespread criticism from large energy
users. The users, who suffer the most from the price rises, buy their power
supplies directly from the pool rather than from an electricity supplier.
Prof Littlechild said that referring the generators would be one of several
options if he found that the prices they charge for running their generating
sets are unacceptably high.
He has also been considering whether to introduce price controls to limit
the charges that the generators levy or whether to reach an agreement with
them on the sale of some of their plant.
The generators have been arguing that either option would be unacceptable
because the prices they charge provide them with only a reasonable rate of
return.
Some analysts believe the generators would prefer to risk the consequences
of a commission reference rather than accept price controls or agree to
voluntary disposals.
Prof Littlechild's statement today is one of several expected within the
next few weeks.
He is also considering an appeal by large energy users over proposed reforms
to the bidding process in the electricity pool.
In addition, Nuclear Electric has asked him to give it a licence to allow it
to sell power directly to industrial customers.
Today's statement on the generators is expected to be given to the Stock
Exchange early this morning.

FT  15 DEC 93 / N&amp;P to sweep away obsolete accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National &amp; Provincial, the eighth-largest building society, is to transfer
Pounds 380m held by 600,000 savers in 40 obsolete accounts into new
accounts, most of which will pay higher interest than the old ones.
The society estimated that about Pounds 20bn was languishing in obsolete
bank and building society accounts in the UK, depriving investors of up to
Pounds 800m a year that they would earn in other accounts.
The N&amp;P savers - accounting for 25 per cent of customers but only 5 per cent
of savers' deposits - will be invited by letter to move to new accounts. If
they do not reply the society will move the accounts for them. Savers will
not have the option of staying with the old accounts - all will be closed.
It says that no saver will be worse off as a result of the automatic
transfer and that many will earn up to 4.5 percentage points gross above
their current rate. Savers will be able to retain special features of an old
account, such as standing orders, even if they are not a feature of the new
one.
Mr Stephen Geraghty, N&amp;P director of customer engagement, said savings on
administration costs would be small compared with the Pounds 5m it would pay
in extra interest. N&amp;P has seven investment accounts for new customers.
The society has spent Pounds 15m a year since 1991 on a campaign to keep
depositors informed about savings rates. About 1m customers have moved to
new accounts as a result. N&amp;P says it will be rid of obsolete accounts by
the end of March. If so, it will be the first building society to sweep its
savings cupboard clean of old accounts.
At least half of N&amp;P's obsolete accounts are the legacy of mergers and many
date back to the days of the Provincial and Burnley building societies which
merged in 1982 to form N&amp;P. Mr Andy Marchant, savings manager, said: 'Very
occasionally someone may not want to move because they are fond of an
account belonging to an old society that they are still loyal to.'
Obsolete accounts include the Whitehaven Old Series which pre-dates the
second world war. There are only 13 savers, earning 0.5 per cent a year
gross. 'It is quite possible that the customers may be deceased,' said Mr
Marchant.
The Burnley Old Series dates back to 1984, while the Keighley account has
only 12 savers.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Pension schemes planned by unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Five of the biggest trade unions plan to make new industry-wide pension
schemes available for their members.
Money-purchase schemes, similar to schemes pioneered in Australia, are being
established in sectors where few employers traditionally offer company
schemes.
The first, negotiated by Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, is expected to be
tried out in January. One covering the voluntary sector should begin by
April. Its administrators said it was supported by the MSF technical union,
the TGWU general union and the Unison public services union.
The GMB general union is exploring the idea in sectors including retailing,
where it has about 40,000 members working for Asda, the supermarket chain.
The union said it did not envisage being involved in a scheme before 1995.
Mr Bill Day, the union's national pensions officer, said: 'We are involved
in construction, engineering, oil rigs and the clothing sector and we are
keen on developing schemes in all those areas.'
The schemes are being co-ordinated by Jacques Martin Unity, a joint-venture
company formed by Unity Trust Bank and Colonial Mutual Life Assurance
Society, the Australian insurance company.
Mr Greg McTaggart, Jacques Martin Unity's chief executive, said the schemes
would cover whole industry sectors and companies would be asked to
contribute for employees. He said: 'We have talked to a number of small
employees who think it's the best thing since sliced bread. The big unknown
question at the moment is, will employers pay?'
The more employers who took part, he said, the more potential the schemes
would have for portability across a sector.

The GMB general union is exploring the idea in sectors including retailing,
where it has about 40,000 members working for Asda, the supermarket chain.
Only about 1,200 members are in the company scheme. The union said that it

Mr Bill Day, the union's national pensions officer, said: 'We are involved

Mr Greg McTaggart, Jacques Martin Unity's chief executive, said the schemes

contribute on behalf of employees.
He said: 'We have talked to a number of small employees who think it's the
best thing since sliced bread. The big unknown question at the moment is
'Will employers pay?''.
When the first scheme was started in Australia employers agreed to make
contributions as an alternative to a wage increase. 'Whether such a
trade-off is acceptable to the average man in the street here is anybody's
guess,' Mr McTaggart said.
The more employers who took part, he said, the more the schemes would have
the potential for portability across a sector. A principal objective, he
said, was to provide some occupational pension cover for trade union members
outside company schemes.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Banker 'controlled sham company'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The former chairman of Wallace Smith Trust, the collapsed merchant bank, had
'complete control' over a separate Canadian company alleged to be at the
centre of a Pounds 100m fraud, an accountant who worked directly to him told
the Old Bailey yesterday.
Mr Patrick Nicholas, a prosecution witness, said Mr Wallace Duncan Smith,
the bank's former chairman, had made him a director of Dundalk Investments,
a company officially based in Edmonton, Alberta. Had he known the true
nature of Dundalk's activities, he would never have got involved with the
company, Mr Nicholas said.
The prosecution alleges that Mr Smith swindled Pounds 100m from other banks
to prevent Wallace Smith Trust collapsing after it ran into financial
difficulties. It claims that Mr Smith used Dundalk, a 'sham' company without
any assets, to carry out a series of transactions which gave the impression
that Wallace Smith Trust was trading profitably.
Mr Smith denies charges of theft, obtaining money by deception, false
accounting and fraudulent trading.
Mr Nicholas, a director of the Canadian company, worked from an office in
Jermyn Street, London.
He told Mr Timothy Barnes QC, prosecuting, that Mr Smith had complete
control over Dundalk's activities.
Mr Nicholas's own unofficial investigation into Dundalk's finances showed it
had no assets of its own, he said. The trial continues.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Private funding helps move museum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A private-sector consortium yesterday put up Pounds 6m of equity to help
fund the transfer of the Royal Armouries national museum from the Tower of
London to Leeds. The deal is said to be the first to use risk capital to
back a museum project.
The backing, led by 3i, the venture capital group, triggers Pounds 28.5m of
public funding the government made conditional on private-sector support.
The Royal Armouries will retain curatorial and artistic control, but the new
museum will be run by a specially created private company, Royal Armouries
International, financed by venture capital and Pounds 8m of loans from the
Bank of Scotland.
3i's contribution to the equity syndicate is Pounds 2.25m, with Pounds 2m
from Electra Investment Trust, Pounds 1m from Yorkshire Electricity and
Pounds 750,000 from Gardner Merchant, the leisure group, which will also
provide management and catering services.
The chairman will be Sir James Glover, a BP director and commander of
British land forces between 1985 and 1987. The chief executive will be Mr
Christopher O'Boyle, a former director of Prudential's property division.
Both have taken equity stakes.
Of the public funding, Pounds 20m is from the Department of National
Heritage. Leeds Development Corporation, a government agency, is
contributing Pounds 5m and Leeds City Council Pounds 3.5m.
The museum opens in 1996.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Tory right fends off challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservative right was in firm control of the party's backbench
committees last night after fighting off a final challenge from the
centre-left.
Mr John Townend, a member of the rightwing 92 Group, was re-elected chairman
of the finance committee by a large majority in a contest with Mr Nigel
Forman, a member of the Mainstream group.
The result marks a further defeat for Mainstream, which was set up in the
summer to bolster support for Mr John Major, the prime minister.
The group failed last month to take control of the executive of the powerful
1922 Committee of backbench Conservatives, which was captured by the 92
Group last year.
Last night's result, which followed an unusually high turnout of 160 MPs,
was welcomed by rightwingers and received stoically by the centre-left.
Mr Townend said the election reflected backbench support for his views on
the need for tight public spending control and minimal tax increases.
Mr Forman said backbenchers had voted for stability. 'The Tory party
tradition is to support the status quo. They did that tonight,' he said.
Mainstream's only success was the removal from the 1922 executive of Sir
George Gardiner, the MP for Reigate, who was one of the most vocal critics
of the Maastricht treaty. Sir George was replaced by another 92 Group
member.
The group's failure to weaken the right's hold on the party's committees
underlines the organisational ability of the 92 Group.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Tobacco advert to be dropped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imperial Tobacco, the Hanson subsidiary, is to scrap its current advertising
campaign for Embassy Regal cigarettes, featuring a character called Reg,
after a complaint from the Health Education Authority that the
advertisements appeal to children.
The Advertising Standards Authority said yesterday that the advertisements
had passed its vetting process and had not contravened a code of practice on
tobacco advertising, but it 'considered that further use of the campaign
would be unwise and therefore requested that it be discontinued'.
The authority's recommendation is likely to fuel debate about whether
controls on tobacco advertising should remain voluntary, or whether all
tobacco advertising should be banned, as the European Commission has argued.
The government is expected to announce a tightening of voluntary controls,
one aim of which would be to head off a private member's bill to ban tobacco
advertising - except at point of sale - being tabled by Mr Kevin Barron,
Labour MP for Rother Valley.
The Embassy Regal posters, which have appeared mainly in Scotland, Wales and
northern England and have won advertising industry awards, feature Reg's
views on life. An example is: 'Reg on party politics - If you drop ash on
the carpet you won't get invited again.'
Research by the Health Education Authority was said to have shown that the
Reg character had become an 'icon' among children. The authority said
surveys showed that 'children in Manchester no longer called each other a
Wally to denote stupidity, they called each other a Reg'.
Imperial Tobacco said yesterday it did not accept the Reg campaign had
encouraged any children to start smoking, but it accepted the Advertising
Standards Authority's role 'as the final arbiter on such matters'.
It added that its own study had concluded that the Health Education
Authority's research was 'highly selective' and 'highly misleading'.

The Consumers' Association yesterday admitted to being embarrassed after the
Advertising Standards Authority found it guilty of misleading advertising.
The authority upheld a complaint by a reader of New Scientist over a leaflet
promoting a prize draw run by the association's Which? magazine.
The leaflet was headed: 'We've doubled your chances of winning the Pounds
250,000 grand first prize. Specially for readers of New Scientist.' It went
on: 'We usually offer six prize draw numbers but for you we have allocated
12 numbers.'
The complainant maintained that if everyone received 12 numbers, the chance
of winning would remain the same. The association admitted that the insert
appeared in 90 magazines, though it said most entries would have come from
mailings offering six numbers.

The authority said it was 'concerned that the insert implied that the 12
numbers were unique to readers of the New Scientist' and upheld the
complaint.
Ms Lesley Godwin, the Consumers' Association head of marketing, said
yesterday: 'The ASA is there to monitor advertising and it's absolutely

FT  15 DEC 93 / High-street recovery slows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Retailers are experiencing a patchy recovery with few signs of a rapid lift
in sales before Christmas, the Confederation of British Industry said
yesterday.
Although retail volumes were up last month on a year previously, the
year-on-year rise was less than in September and October and optimism about
short-term business prospects has fallen back.
But companies running shops and supermarkets are planning to increase
capital spending over the next 12 months by more than at any time since
1987.
Staff numbers in retailing are also up on 12 months ago, the first
year-on-year increase since late 1990, mainly on account of retailers hiring
more part-time workers.
The findings, from the CBI's latest survey of the distributive trades,
underline how consumers are increasing spending only slowly after the
recession.
The survey took soundings from 494 distribution companies - taking in
wholesalers and car showrooms as well as shops - between November 9 and
December 1. It may have been affected by uncertainty before the Budget on
November 30.
Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel and a
director of the Kingfisher retail group, said growth in the sector 'remained
uneven'. There had been little sign of a pre-Christmas boost, with many
people following the pattern of previous years and delaying shopping for as
long as possible in the hope of finding bargains.
The weak level of retail price inflation is underlined by shops having
raised prices in the past year by the smallest amount since the CBI began
the surveys 10 years ago.
Among specific sectors of retailing, grocers and chemists shops turned in
relatively good sales growth last month, while furniture, carpets, general
household durables and alcoholic drinks did badly.
In the wholesaling industry, companies reported overall year-on-year sales
growth last month, although business was weaker than in October. The general
slowdown among wholesalers is expected to continue up to Christmas.
Motor traders reported modest year-on-year sales growth in November, but
expect a fall in the year to December.
Of retailers in the survey, 51 per cent said volumes rose in November
compared with a year previously, while 28 per cent said sales were down.
That gave a balance reporting higher sales of 23 percentage points, compared
with the balances of 26 and 25 points in October and September and 3 points
in August.
For all retailers, the balance of 11 percentage points of shops saying sales
were poor for the time of year was the least encouraging result since May
last year.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Largest companies improve liquidity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's large industrial and commercial companies improved their
short-term liquidity position in the third quarter as they used the proceeds
of share and bond issues to build up current financial assets and repay
short-term borrowings.
Seasonally adjusted figures released by the Central Statistical Office
yesterday showed that the overall liquidity ratio of large UK companies
increased to an estimated 123 per cent at the end of the third quarter from
111 per cent at mid-year.
The ratio measures current assets maturing in less than a year as a share of
liabilities that have to be repaid in less than a year. It is based on a
survey of 350 of Britain's biggest companies and gives an indication of the
short-term financial strength of the large-company sector.
The liquidity ratio of large manufacturing companies increased to 105 per
cent at the end of September from 96 per cent at the end of June.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Construction prices forecast to rise 8%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Construction prices are forecast to rise by 8 per cent during the next two
years, casting 'doubt on the chancellor's assertion that falling prices will
offset cuts in spending on roads and housing', says a survey published
today.
The survey, by the building-cost information service of the Royal
Institution of Chartered Surveyors, says builders faced with rising material
costs will be forced to increase prices.
Its forecasts are based on analysis of tenders accepted for building schemes
during the past three months.
The findings fly in the face of the Mr Kenneth Clarke's assertion in the
Budget that falling prices will enable the government to cut public spending
without damaging construction programmes.
Mr Christopher Vickers, a senior partner at quantity surveyors EC Harris and
construction spokesman for the institution, said construction prices had
fallen by a fifth since 1989. Building contractors could no longer afford to
absorb rising material prices, and as a result were increasing tender
prices.
Prices of constructional steel, cement, concrete, plasterboard, engineering
bricks and some types of glass have all risen this year and more increases
are likely, say material producers.
The institution says the knock-on effect will require contractors to raise
prices by 2.5 per cent between the fourth quarter of this year and the
fourth quarter of 1994. It says further increases in 1994-95 would push
prices up by 8 per cent over two years. The value of new commissions won by
architects fell by 5 per cent during the three months to the end of
September compared with the previous quarter, says a survey by the Royal
Institute of British Architects published today.
The survey, which is a good guide to future order trends in the construction
industry, says the fall was due partly to the ending of capital allowances
for industrial building.
None the less, the decline emphasised the 'fragility of the construction
industry recovery'. New commissions to architects had risen in each of the
two previous quarters.
More architects (27 per cent) expected workloads to increase than those (21
per cent) expecting work to reduce. But the positive balance had fallen to 6
percentage points from 14 percentage points.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Beckett slams move to cut sick-pay cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Planned reductions in the statutory sick-pay subsidy would impose
'substantial' costs on small employers, in spite of assurances from
ministers that the changes should reduce industry's costs, the Labour party
said yesterday.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, told the Commons that the
government had deceived its backbenchers by disguising the true impact of
changes in the sickness benefit rules and rushing them through parliament
this week.
She said small employers paying less than Pounds 20,000 a year in national
insurance would face bigger costs because they would receive no subsidy for
the first four weeks of sickness pay. Surveys suggested that the average
employee was rarely sick for longer.
Labour has withdrawn parliamentary co-operation in protest at the cabinet's
decision to guillotine debate on the sick pay legislation and a bill
increasing national insurance contributions.
However, the government won the first round in its battle to get the bills
through when a motion cutting short debate was approved by 307 votes to 266,
a government majority of 41.
Labour, which has withdrawn pairing arrangements in an attempt to force all
Conservative MPs to attend the Commons for every vote, said its campaign of
not co-operating would continue when parliament resumed after the Christmas
recess.
Labour MPs forced a series of votes on non-contentious issues late last
night, underlining the leadership's determination to make life as difficult
as possible for the Conservatives. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, told
Labour MPs in a letter that the guillotine procedure was 'indefensible'. His
statement appeared designed to dispel rumours that the campaign of not
co-operating would be dropped when the Commons rises on Friday.
However, the political temperature was raised by Mr John Major, the prime
minister, who told MPs at question time that the campaign was a 'sham'. He
said it was designed to cover up the 'total mess' made by Labour's treasury
team during the parliamentary debate on the imposition of value added tax on
heating fuel.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Plaid Cymru suspends pairing arrangements
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party, yesterday followed Labour's lead
by suspending pairing arrangements with government MPs.
Mr Ieuan Wyn Jones, party whip, said its four MPs would review the decision
'once it becomes clear whether the Labour party intend to run a hard
campaign to bring down the government'.
The decision means Mr John Major, the prime minister, will be unable to miss
votes without reducing the government's majority. He is paired with Mr
Dafydd Wigley, the Plaid Cymru MP for Caernarfon.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Anger over change to new agency rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE and STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British companies which have sacked their commercial agents and renegotiated
their agency agreements to reduce the impact of new rules bringing UK law
into line with Europe may lose money following last-minute changes.
Companies had been advised, on the basis of draft regulations issued by the
Department of Trade and Industry in June, to consider renegotiating their
agreements because cancelling them after January 1 could cost between Pounds
5,000 and Pounds 80,000 per agreement in compensation.
The regulations, which will apply to any agency agreement in force on
January 1, are designed to give self-employed commercial agents greater
protection. They make it harder for companies to terminate agreements and
guarantee agents compensation if sacked.
The draft regulations provided that compensation should be paid for any
damage suffered by the agent following termination of the agreement.
But after complaints that this left companies open to pay unlimited damages
the government has made a last-minute change to the regulations to allow
industry to cap compensation.
Instead of paying damages companies can agree to indemnify the agent for a
sum equivalent to a maximum of one year's commission if the agreement is
terminated.
The change, which was set out in the final regulations published on Monday,
gives companies greater flexibility in negotiating new agreements.
Mr Ian Campbell, director-general of the Institute of Export, welcomed the
change but said: 'I can imagine a lot of companies will be annoyed if they
have acted on advice and changed their agreements, and will now have to
spend money to change them again.'
Mr Colin Dawson, managing director of Frank Whitelegg, which makes coil
winding machines and equipment for electric-motor repairs, said: 'It must be
a good idea to limit the compensation. Many companies could have been in for
an expensive time if the directive went through unchanged.'
Mr Tim Foster, of City solicitors Warner Cranston, said companies which
renegotiated agreements in anticipation of the new law were annoyed that
they had to change them again before January 1.
The DTI said yesterday it had been made clear that the regulations published
in June were only a draft and that changes could be made to the final text.
It added: 'We would never advise people to give advice to industry on the
basis of a draft.'
But Ms Rebecca Attree, an agency law specialist with London solicitors
Laytons, pointed out that even those clients who had held back from
renegotiating their agreements in case there were last-minute changes to the
rules were irritated. 'They now find they have very little time left to meet
the deadline - 10 days to be exact,' she said.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Graduates 'happier on dole than in stop-gap jobs'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Graduates are happier and healthier if they stay unemployed until they get
the job they really want, according to research by Dr Tony Cassidy, a
psychologist of Nene College, Northampton.
He told the British Psychological Society yesterday that graduates doing
stop-gap jobs, such as working as sales assistants, were worse off than
those on the dole.
Those in stop-gap jobs were more likely to complain of difficulty sleeping,
feeling weak and believing they were inferior. Those who were unemployed
felt more motivated to achieve and more optimistic.
The Confederation of British Industry took issue with the findings, arguing
that the research could also be taken as further proof that universities
were failing to prepare students for the world of work.
Mr Robbie Gilbert, employee relations director at the CBI, said: 'It has
been a long-standing complaint of employers that universities do not prepare
people for work and this research could be said to support that view.'
Mr Gilbert said that there was no reason to doubt the conventional wisdom
that employers were likely to be more impressed by someone who had been
working rather than sitting at home.
Dr Cassidy said only one in 10 of the 160 young people he surveyed was in a
job of choice. Graduate unemployment stands at about 12 per cent.
Defending his findings, Dr Cassidy said: 'What this survey shows more than
anything is the importance of giving proper career guidance to students in
their final year. This would identify their strengths and weaknesses and
prepare them for potential problems.'

FT  15 DEC 93 / Matrix Churchill trial was 'ludicrous': Former trade
minister tells Iraq arms probe of 'surrealistic' government operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last year's abortive prosecution of three British businessmen for illegally
selling machine tools to Iraqi weapons factories should not have happened,
Mr Alan Clark, former trade minister, told the Scott inquiry yesterday.
Mr Clark said the trial of the executives of Matrix Churchill, the
machine-tool manufacturer, was 'ludicrous' and served no public interest.
On his second day of evidence Mr Clark said: 'It (the trial) was long after
the event. I didn't see what damage had actually been done. I didn't see any
deterrent effect this was going to have on others. I didn't really see any
justification for it.'
Mr Clark described how officials and ministers had approved the export of
machine tools knowing they were defence-related because they hoped to gain
further intelligence information.
He referred to the 'surrealistic' atmosphere in which the government and
intelligence services operated under guidelines that were supposed to
restrict defence sales.
'Intelligence was telling you what the machine tools were going to be used
for but the machine tools had to be provided to protect the source that was
telling you about the machine tools. There was a total circularity that was
absurd,' Mr Clark said.
He told the public hearing: 'One would have thought that (Customs) were
under an obligation to acquaint themselves with the facts,' before going
ahead with the prosecution.
Mr Clark said that 'to some extent' he himself had been 'negligent' by
giving an inaccurate witness statement prior to the trial. The statement had
denied outright that he had given machine-tool manufacturers approval to go
ahead with exports to Iraq knowing they had a military use.
It was his admission at last year's Old Bailey trial that he was 'economical
. . . with the actualite' which prompted the prosecution's collapse.
Earlier yesterday Mr Clark suggested that the Foreign Office had
deliberately ignored the diversion of illegal arms exports to Iraq via
Jordan for foreign policy reasons.
After describing Jordan's 'notorious role' in breaking sanctions Mr Clark
said: 'I never understood the level of trust which was reposed in Jordan. I
assume that wider diplomatic considerations came into it.'
He told the inquiry that he was 'so angry' with Jordan that, following the
invasion of Kuwait, he prevented King Hussein from officiating at a parade
at the British military academy of Sandhurst.
A British military engineering company has been charged in the US with
secretly selling to Iraq an assembly line used to make artillery fuses.
Four executives of Ordtec in Reading, Berkshire, have been convicted in this
country of similar offences. Ministers stopped documents, which indicated
that the government knew what the company was doing, from going before the
court.
After the collapse of the Matrix Churchill case the four Ordtec executives,
who received suspended sentences or were fined, said they would appeal
against their convictions.
Mr Michael Chertoff, US attorney for New Jersey, said Ordtec and Rexon
Technology Corporation of Wayne, New Jersey, were accused of violating the
US Arms Export Control Act by attempting to ship the equipment through
Jordan.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Lawyers told to end court 'abuse'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lawyers in serious fraud cases were warned yesterday by an Old Bailey judge
not to go on 'fishing expeditions' which were forbidden by law and an abuse
of court processes.
Judge Neil Denison made his remarks as he discharged three witness summonses
obtained by lawyers acting for Mr Mohammed Baqi against accountants Price
Waterhouse, the Bank of England and Treasury solicitors.
Mr Baqi, former managing director of Attock Oil, is due to face trial next
year on charges arising from the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International. He is charged with dishonestly supplying documents to BCCI's
auditors Price Waterhouse.
The judge said the summons against Price Waterhouse required the firm to
produce all the documents in the BCCI case.
This was no more than 'a fishing expedition' in the hope that a trawl
through the vast amount of papers which Price Waterhouse would have to
analyse at their own expense might produce something useful to the defence,
he said.
The summonses against the Bank of England and Treasury solicitors had a
similar purpose.
The judge said: 'This sort of fishing expedition is expressly forbidden by
law and to try to get it by witness summons is an abuse of the process of
the court.'
When judges and lawyers engaged in large fraud trials were constantly
exhorted by the Court of Appeal to narrow the issues to be considered by
juries the issue of witness summonses such as these would do nothing to
simplify the trial, he said.

The government appeared last night to be preparing for a European Union

Mr Michael Jack, fisheries minister, warned the Commons that a deal might be
imposed by the EU fisheries council in Brussels on Monday, in spite of
British and Irish objections.
The government also announced that legislation restricting the number of
days on which fishing vessels can put to sea has been suspended following a
court challenge by fishermen. The High Court has referred the so-called
'days at sea legislation' to the European Court.
The government refused to confirm that a Pounds 25m decommissioning scheme
designed to help trawler owners leave the industry will continue after next
year. Mr Jack said ministers wanted to reconsider all the options for
meeting fishing quotas set by the fisheries council.
The issue is complicated by the requirement for a decision by the end of
this year on a EU fisheries regime to replace the transitional arrangements
for Spain and Portugal. The existing regime, which expires in 1996, has
assisted UK fishermen by limiting access to territorial waters for Spanish
and Portuguese vessels.
British ministers have argued that overall controls on catches must be
increased to compensate for the impending relaxation of the restrictive
regime. Only Ireland has given strong support to this position, raising
fears that Britain will be outvoted.
Opposition MPs urged the government to abandon the days-at-sea legislation,
and guarantee the future of the decommissioning scheme to help reduce the
British fleet. Mr Gavin Strang, shadow agriculture minister, said: 'This
decision was another botched opportunity. What the industry needed was a
clear-cut decision that days-at-sea restrictions had gone for good.'
He added that the government's refusal to guarantee the future of the
decommissioning scheme was 'petulant.' The suspension of the days-at-sea
rule strengthened the case for an enhanced decommissioning scheme.

He announced draft legislation designed to bring UK law in line with the

the home country of any insurer its regulator wherever it operates within
the EU.
The draft legislation includes requirements for additional disclosure on
derivative contracts, shareholder controllers and valuations.

Labour yesterday stepped up its campaign against bureaucracy in the NHS,
James Blitz writes.
At prime minister's question time Mr Smith claimed recent reforms of the NHS
had allowed health organisations to spend more money on bureaucracy and
public relations.
He referred to Sir Robin Buchanan, chairman of the NHS Supplies Authority
and a former Tory councillor, whose organisation was recently criticised for
spending decisions. Mr Smith said that the organisation had 'wasted hundreds
of thousands of pounds changing a single word in their name'.
Mr John Major said spending on NHS administration was 'very tightly examined
and controlled' and more patients were being treated than ever before. The
prime minister added that NHS administration amounted to only 2 per cent of
total costs.

The government is to suspend the implementation of restrictions in the
number of days fishermen can spend at sea pending a ruling by the European
Court, Mr Michael Jack, fisheries minister, announced yesterday.
Earlier this month the High Court referred to the European Court a
government proposal to restrict the number of days that fishing vessels can
spend at sea to 1991 levels. The restriction was aimed at conserving fishing
stocks.
The ruling came after a legal challenge by the National Federation of
Fishermen's Organisations, which represents 6,000 fishermen in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Beckett slams move to cut sick-pay cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Planned reductions in the statutory sick-pay subsidy would impose
'substantial' costs on small employers, in spite of assurances from
ministers that the changes should reduce industry's costs, the Labour party
said yesterday.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, told the Commons that the
government had deceived its backbenchers by disguising the true impact of
changes in the sickness benefit rules and rushing them through parliament
this week. She said that reductions in sick-pay subsidy for employers and
increases in National Insurance Contributions (NIC) for employees were
taxation items deserving a considered debate by MPs.
Ministers pressed ahead with plans to get both bills through their Commons
stages by tomorrow, however, saying that they had already been well
discussed in both the Queen's Speech and Budget debates in recent weeks.
Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, said when introducing a guillotine
motion to curtail debate on the legislation that neither bill was 'long and
complicated'. Both had to be on the statute book by February if employers
were to be presented with a timely indication of their new costs.
Mrs Beckett said small employers paying less than Pounds 20,000 a year in
national insurance would face bigger costs because they would be getting no
subsidy for employees who were sick for up to four weeks. She said surveys
suggested that the average employee was rarely sick for longer.
Ministers said the increased costs were offset by recent cuts in the NIC
rate for employers.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, told Labour MPs in a letter released last
night that it was 'indefensible' that the sick-pay and social-security
contributions bills should be forced to pass all their parliamentary stages
in one day.
He said the opposition was determined to continue its campaign of not
co-operating with the government when parliament resumed.
His statement appeared designed to dispel rumours circulating at Westminster
that the campaign, triggered by the guillotine proposals, would be quietly
dropped when the Commons went into recess for three weeks on Friday.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Labour attacks rises in cost of NHS bureaucracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Smith, the leader of the opposition, accused a leading NHS executive
of 'grotesque mismanagement of public funds' as Labour yesterday stepped up
its campaign against bureaucracy in the National Health Service.
At prime minister's question time in the House of Commons, Mr Smith claimed
recent reforms of the NHS had allowed health organisations to spend more
money on bureaucracy and public relations.
'It is disgraceful that in the health service the sums of money being spent
on increased bureaucracy, on huge salaries and perks for managers and on
glossy public relations seem totally out of control,' he said.
He referred to Sir Robin Buchanan, chairman of the NHS Supplies Authority
and a former Tory councillor, whose organisation was recently criticised for
spending decisions.
Mr Smith said that the organisation had 'wasted hundreds of thousands of
pounds changing a single word in their name'.
In reply Mr John Major said that spending on NHS administration was 'very
tightly examined and controlled' and that more patients were being treated
than ever before.
The prime minister added that NHS administration amounted to only 2 per cent
of total costs. 'There are very few companies that could match that,' he
said.
However, Mr Smith's attack comes amid signs of disquiet within the cabinet
over the cost of NHS reforms. Health service officials have said that Mrs
Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, is privately concerned about
recent increases in NHS managers' salaries. Mr John Redwood, the Welsh
Secretary, also issued a strong attack last month on growing NHS
bureaucracy.
Under the NHS reforms regional health authorities have been given greater
autonomy for spending on hospital and ambulance services. Ministers say that
greater competition in the health service should encourage institutions to
keep costs low.
But Mr Alan Milburn, a Labour Treasury spokesman, said yesterday: 'There is
a very powerful message to get across about the extent of costs under the
current administration and the increase in bureaucracy.'

FT  15 DEC 93 / World Trade News: EU to consider Uruguay draft today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EU foreign ministers will today consider whether to give their seal of
approval to the draft Uruguay Round accord, a long-awaited decision which
depends on resolving French demands for stronger European trade mechanisms.
Last night, hints of a compromise emerged in Brussels which raised hopes
that the foreign ministers would succeed in their bid for approval of the
Gatt world trade deal before the midnight deadline.
UK, German and Brussels diplomats suggested yesterday that London and Bonn
were ready to soften some of their opposition to French demands which would
make it easier for the European Commission to take action against unfair
traders through speedier anti-dumping measures.
It remained unclear whether the concessions would be enough to satisfy Mr
Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, who declared last Monday that Paris
would sign a Gatt deal only on condition that trade weapons were
strengthened. However, in a TV interview last night, he called the Gatt deal
'a compromise more than honourable' and said France had achieved its
objectives on all major issues.
The news that Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, had succeeded in
removing the culturally-sensitive film and broadcasting industry from the
Gatt draft agreement achieved in Geneva yesterday was seen as a major boost.
Today Sir Leon is expected to call on EU foreign ministers to consider the
merits of the deal in its entirety, rather than raising outstanding points
of grievance.
Ministers will not vote on the deal today since there is no possibility,
either legally or politically, for EU member states to outvote France. Sir
Leon has used the formula of 'all for one, and one for all' used by the
Three Musketeers.
But the final seal of approval appears to rest on France's requests for
tougher trade weapons which threaten to overturn the principle that a
minority of free-trade countries led by the UK and Germany could use their
combined voting weight to thwart trade retaliation.
These include acceleration of anti-dumping measures, as well as the
invocation of 'safeguard' measures to deal with sudden surges of cheap
imports. France would also like to create a new EU instrument similar to the
US Section 301 market-opening weapon.
A core issue concerns how EU member states can obtain redress if their
complaints about unfair trading are upheld by the Multilateral Trade
Organisation, the new body which will replace Gatt panels. Some officials
said the free-traders might be ready to concede simple majority voting in
this area.
Other officials said Germany and the UK might give ground on anti-dumping
but were reluctant to make it easier to invoke safeguard clauses. Creation
of a new European 301 mechanism to achieve 'nuclear balance' with the US
remains highly contentious.

FT  15 DEC 93 / World Trade News: US opts to bide time on audio-visual
battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jack Valenti, head of the Motion Picture Association of America, nursed
his disappointment with fortitude in Geneva yesterday over exclusion of the
audio-visual sector from the Uruguay Round package, despite three days
without sleep, and a day without food.
'The real losers are the people of Europe,' he said: 'They will have much
less choice.'
But in Paris there was little sign that locals appreciated their loss.
France's ministers of culture and communication, echoed by the country's
film industry, claimed they had won a famous victory in keeping audio-visual
broadcasting out of the Gatt agreement with the US.
'We got what we wanted from the start, which is basically the cultural
exception,' said Mr Alain Carignon, the communications minister.
Mr Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, will today put the EU's draft
Gatt accord with the US before the French parliament, confident of winning
approval.
Mr Valenti was emphatic that the row of recent weeks had been much less
about preservation of European culture than France and other EU protagonists
claim: 'If you equate Europe's game shows and talk shows with Moliere and
Racine, then that's about culture. But the culture issue is a transparent
cloak, and I want to disrobe Europe on this.'
He argues that the US has captured a rising share of film showings in Europe
 -now estimated at 80 per cent - because of the poverty of offerings from
European film-makers.
He noted that the rise in the US share of the French film market was due not
to rising US showings, but to falling audiences for French films. Between
1983 and 1992, audiences for French films in French theatres fell from 90m a
year, to 48m a year, he said. US showings declined slightly, from 70m to
68m.
For many Uruguay Round negotiators, the row over access to Europe's film and
television markets has been a bemusing irrelevance, an essentially bilateral
affair. As the dispute has dragged closer to today's Uruguay Round deadline,
it has become a matter of increasing frustration and annoyance.
Negotiators yesterday could not celebrate the outcome, but were at least
happy with the fact that it was at last out of the way - with a bare 40
hours to go before the talks deadline.
US negotiators have insisted that they have been immensely flexible in the
audio-visual dispute, steadily relaxing demands as the past three months of
talks dragged on.
At 3am yesterday, the bottom-line US proposal included four components:
The EU would be free to continue reserving 51 per cent of local television
programming to European productions, but the US wanted this to apply to the
24-hour day as a whole. At present, for example, France bars non-European
programmes from all prime time.
For satellite, cable and other 'signals' of the future, where there may soon
be as many as 300 signals, the US was willing for the EU to reserve 50-70
per cent of all channels, but was opposed to EU demands that each and every
channel must carry 51 per cent European content. Among existing channels,
this could bar the Comedy Channel, Nickelodeon, the Disney channel and the
Discovery Channel, and create problems for Sky One and Sky Movies Plus. US
artists and producers should be entitled to 'their fair share' of the levies
raised on blank audio and video tapes, but would commit to invest the funds
raised in Europe's film and television industries. Pay-per-view and
video-on-demand channels should not be restricted, since consumers make a
free choice to watch one film rather than another.
What the EU finally offered in the early hours of yesterday was a standstill
on existing legislation, providing a binding EU commitment that no more than
51 per cent of programming would be reserved; and a commitment to begin
open-ended talks on how the audio-visual sector should be handled
multilaterally.
Left with the choice of rejecting the EU proposal, or accepting a deal which
'would have enshrined the principle of limiting viewers' rights to see what
they wish ..and recognised a system which denies artists and producers the
right to funds legally earned through royalties,' Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade
representative, opted to reject the deal.
'We have decided not to accept a meaningless fig-leaf,' he said. 'We can
best advance the interests of our artists, performers and producers  - and
the free flow of information around the world - by reserving all our legal
rights to respond to policies that discriminate in these areas.'
Mr Valenti last night was less focused on whether retaliation was possible.
'I'm flying home to get a good night's rest, and then we will try to sort
out what the future holds,' he said.

FT  15 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Accord boosts spirits in Scotch whisky
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scotch whisky exports from the UK, worth Pounds 2bn last year, should be
boosted by the Gatt agreement.
'In the short term, implementation of the 'zero for zero' agreement,
initiated in Tokyo in July, will remove import duties for Scotch in seven
countries, lopping almost 50p off the price of a bottle in New Zealand, for
example, and just over Pounds 1 a bottle in Japan,' said Mr Bill Bewsher,
director general of the Scotch Whisky Association.
'Real strides will be made in international markets if there is swift and
significant action to reduce import tariffs by 30 per cent overall,' he
added. Such a move would reduce the price of a bottle by Pounds 2.50 in
Egypt, Pounds 1.90 in Korea, and 60p in Venezuela and Poland.
With agreement on reducing tariff barriers, Mr Bewsher said, the time was
right for serious negotiations on non-tariff restrictions.
Scotch whisky at present faced tariff and non-tariff barriers in about 130
markets. Excise tax discrimination was widespread.
In Japan, Scotch was taxed between six and nine times the rate of shochu,
the local spirit. Other non-tax barriers were equally damaging to Scotch's
ability to compete in overseas markets. Korea hindered market access through
a system of licensing distribution; Argentina required immediate payments of
duty on imports but allowed domestic drinks 45 days and Hungary operated
quotas.

FT  15 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Cuba and Caricom in bid to increase trade
</HEADLINE>

   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cuba and the Caribbean Community have signed a controversial agreement
establishing a joint commission to increase trade and technical co-operation
between the island and its neighbours.
The commission, which has been attacked by the US State Department and by
several US legislators, will oversee co-operation in several areas,
including trade and the development of the region's sugar cane industry.
The agreement, which was signed on Monday, is aimed at increasing the volume
of trade between Cuba and Caricom, improvement in sugar cane yields,
co-operation in developing livestock and fisheries, and will combine
research in biotechnology, particularly for agricultural and technical
applications.
The commission represents several years of work by the Cuban government to
raise the level of contact with its neighbours, many of which have been slow
to entertain the Cubans because of concern over a negative reaction from
Washington.
Mr Ricardo Cabrisas, Cuba's external trade minister, said on Monday that the
establishment of the joint commission will allow Caribbean companies to make
use of new economic opportunities in Cuba.
'Our economic and commercial space resulting from the opening of our economy
is being occupied by capital and markets of diverse origin, and we would not
like the Caribbean to arrive too late,' he said.
'We invite the Caribbean not to waste this opportunity to link ourselves
more closely and create better conditions with a view towards a future
economic integration of the Caribbean.'
The region's private sector was told by Mr Edwin Carrington,
secretary-general of Caricom, to pursue investment opportunities in Cuba,
and in other countries with which Caricom has similar agreements. Jamaican
hotel companies have invested heavily in Cuban tourism.

FT  15 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Deal seen as triumph for multilateral
rules
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The deal finally struck yesterday by Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade
representative, and Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade negotiator, was greeted as,
above all, a triumph for the multilateral trading system.
There was disappointment that in the three key services areas -
audio-visual, financial services and maritime transport - the degree of
trade liberalisation was minimal. But the fact that all three sectors were
squarely within the services agreement of the Uruguay Round was met with
relief.
This means all three areas fall under multilateral rules and disputes
settlement procedures and will be subject to future negotiations to bargain
away present restrictions.
The US and EU have also agreed to continue talks on a revised Gatt code
governing subsidies to civil aircraft in hope of concluding a deal by the
end of next year, before the round comes into effect.
Moreover, the US has finally agreed to support the creation of a
Multilateral Trade Organisation with strengthened powers to settle disputes.
Under the MTO accord, governments must use multilateral procedures wherever
they apply, which will include, for the first time, disputes over services
and intellectual property.
This implies tight constraints on the future use of unilateral action by the
US, a primary goal of the European Union and other trading partners from the
beginning of the Uruguay Round in 1986.
'Use of Section 301 won't be possible where there are multilateral rules,'
Mr Hugo Paemen, chief EU negotiator, said yesterday, referring to the US law
authorising unilateral reprisals.
On financial services, the US has staged a tactical retreat on its
controversial two-tier plan for access to its banking, securities and
insurance market. The solution reached between the US and EU, brokered by
Gatt mediators, preserves the overriding Gatt principle of
non-discrimination between trading partners through most-favoured-nation
treatment.
The US will offer a basic level of access to its domestic financial services
market to all Gatt members, irrespective of what they have agreed to do in
return. Access beyond the basic level will be subject to an MFN exemption
and so will depend on whether countries offer reciprocity.
However, when the Uruguay Round package comes into force, in January or July
1995, the US will suspend this MFN exemption for six months. If, at the end
of that time, it is satisfied with the offers other nations have made to
open their financial services markets, the suspension will be made
permanent.
This gives negotiators a breathing space of 18 months to two years to
conclude better market-opening deals on financial services which would
enable the US to extend MFN treatment to the whole of its domestic financial
market. The US has Japan most closely in its sights, along with some East
Asian and Latin American nations.
On maritime services, the EU has withdrawn its liberalisation offer in
response to Washington's refusal to put more than 3 per cent of its deep-sea
shipping business on the table. Thus, there will be no liberalisation of
maritime transport by the US and EU, and other nations such as Japan are
likely to follow suit.
Though US objections finally scuppered an attempt to 'multilateralise' the
bilateral US/EU pact limiting state supports for Airbus, the two sides have
agreed to try to reach accord on a revised Gatt civil aircraft code within
the next 12 months.
Meanwhile, the bilateral pact remains in place and, after securing certain
detailed changes, the EU has accepted that civil aircraft should be covered
by the new Gatt subsidies agreement.

FT  15 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Air Canada buys Airbus widebodies worth
Dollars 800m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Airbus aircraft manufacturing consortium yesterday announced
six firm orders from Air Canada for its new long-range A340-300 widebody
airliner worth more than Dollars 800m (Pounds 537m).
It also said it was setting up a new division in Beijing called Airbus
Industrie China to reinforce the group's commercial, industrial and product
support operations in the fast-growing Chinese aviation market.
Airbus will create a training centre and spares facility in Beijing as part
of its expansion into the Chinese market.
The Air Canada order for A340 aircraft follows last week's order by Cathay
Pacific, the Hong-Kong based airline, for a similar order for six A340-300
long-range air-liners.
The two deals are a boost for Airbus which is competing fiercely against the
US Boeing company's new 777 twin-engine widebody airliner with its A340
four-engine aircraft and its twin-engine sister, the A330.
Airbus is also seeking to make growing inroads into the Chinese market
against tough competition from the US manufacturers which have already
developed a strong presence in China.
The European consortium currently has three customers and airline operators
in China including China Eastern in Shanghai, China Northwest Airlines in
Xian and China Northern in Shenyang. It has won orders for 18 airliners from
China this year.

<TEXT>
A judge in the US state of Colorado struck down yesterday a measure that
would have banned all state laws to protect homosexuals, Reuter reports from
Denver.
The measure, which arose from a citizens' initiative and became an amendment
to the state constitution in November 1992, set off a national boycott and
has cost the state millions of dollars in revenue from conventions. Various
groups declined to hold gatherings in Colorado while the amendment was in
place.
Denver District Court Judge Jeffrey Bayless ruled the measure
unconstitutional yesterday. He had earlier blocked implementation of the
amendment until his final decision.
The measure would have repealed existing ordinances designed to protect
homosexuals from discrimination while prohibiting the enactment of similar
laws in the state.

Mr Paul Mozer, the former head of government bond trading at Salomon
Brothers, was sentenced to four months' imprisonment last night for his role
in the Treasury auction scandal that pushed the Wall Street securities firm
into deep crisis in 1991, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
Mr Mozer had faced a maximum of 10 years in prison under the offence.
Judge Pierre Laval of the US district court in Manhattan, who described the
38-year-old Mr Mozer's crimes as 'foolish, arrogant and insouciant,' also
fined him a total of Dollars 30,100.
Yesterday's sentencing followed a plea agreement earlier this year between
the former Salomon trader and federal prosecutors. Under the terms of the
agreement Mr Mozer pleaded guilty to two felony counts relating to his
falsifying of customer bids during auctions of US government securities.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Canada's care under the spotlight: Bernard Simon on a
welfare system that some say needs re-targeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A visitor to Toronto, Montreal or Vancouver can quickly spot some obvious
differences between Canada and the US. Homeless 'street people', an
all-too-common sight in cities south of the border, are rare. Even the most
down-at-heel parts of Canadian cities are nowhere near as decrepit as New
York's Harlem, the south side of Chicago or east St Louis.
One reason is Canada's comprehensive and generous social security system.
Anyone out of work can claim unemployment insurance of up to CDollars 425
(Pounds 215) a week for almost a year. When that runs out, the welfare
system kicks in with payments of up to CDollars 1,530 a month for a family
of four, plus benefits such as subsidised housing and free medicines.
Pensioners receive as much as CDollars 841 a month. Even rebellious
teenagers who storm out of home are eligible for 'student welfare', with few
questions asked.
Canada's healthcare system offers a panoply of benefits found in few other
countries. Financed by company payroll taxes or individual levies (depending
on the province), it provides comprehensive and sophisticated treatment for
everyone through a doctor of their choice.
But the outward appearance of a compassionate and successful social security
net masks some deep-seated flaws.
There is a consensus that the programmes have lost direction, failing to
solve the problems of those who need them most, while lavishing benefits on
many for whom they were never intended.
Welfare, which was at first aimed at society's most disadvantaged people,
has increasingly become a haven for the able-bodied unemployed.
Professor Paul Hobson, an economics professor at Acadia University in Nova
Scotia, and Ms France St-Hilaire, research director of the Institute for
Research on Public Policy in Montreal, estimated in a recent article that
only 30-50 per cent of Canada Assistance Plan recipients - the programme of
last resort - come from such vulnerable groups as the disabled, elderly or
single mothers, down from 90 per cent in the early 1970s.
Unemployment insurance is under fire both for its generosity and its
structure, under which the duration of benefits varies according to regional
unemployment rates. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development's latest annual report on Canada, the system reduces 'the
incentive and the mobility of unemployed individuals in finding a new job'.
Few politicians dared discuss the highly-charged topic of social security
and health-care reform during the general election campaign last October.
Since then, however, policy-makers of all persuasions have acknowledged the
need for a far-reaching overhaul.
'I'm convinced that the time has come when the political will exists to make
changes,' says Prof Hobson.
The catalyst has been the spiralling cost of the programmes at a time when
the federal government and the provinces are under intense pressure to rein
in widening budget deficits.
Unemployment insurance and social assistance payments now make up almost 3
per cent of gross national product, compared with 1 per cent in 1965.
According to the OECD, Canada has overtaken Sweden with the highest
per-capita health care spending among countries with national health
systems.
With social security, health care and education making up about 60 per cent
of total outlays by all levels of government, economists agree that
wholesale reform of these programmes is the only way to make a meaningful
dent in budget deficits.
Changes so far have been mostly on the margin. For instance, the provinces
have gradually trimmed the list of subsidised medicines available to senior
citizens. The federal government earlier this year left numerous loopholes
in a law which withholds unemployment insurance from people who voluntarily
leave a job.
But the challenges of going further are enormous. Devising more
narrowly-targeted programmes with incentives for recipients to escape the
welfare trap is only part of the problem. Social security funding raises
issues that go to the heart of Canada's national values and constitutional
make-up.
Many Canadians view their social security system as one of their defining
hallmarks. The attempt to trim benefits will almost certainly raise a
political storm.
Responsibility for funding and delivering social security is split between
the federal government and the 10 provinces. But the division is a messy
one. Many programmes delivered by the provinces are partly financed by
federal tax revenues.
Ottawa's hold on the purse-strings has left the provinces open to arbitrary
cuts. Since 1990 for instance, the federal government has capped the growth
of its transfers under the Canada Assistance Plan to the three richest
provinces - Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia.
It has also frozen the per capital entitlement for health care and higher
education transfers. The federal contribution to these programmes in Ontario
has dropped to 31 per cent from 52 per cent in 1980. The drop helps explain
why provincial deficits have soared in recent years, and why Canadian
provinces are now among the most active borrowers on international capital
markets.
The provinces have suggested that instead of relying on transfers from
Ottawa, they should be given wider taxation powers themselves.
Such proposals raise fears, however, that a fundamental tenet of the
Canadian federation - uniform standards of social services across the
country - will be undermined as each province tailors its suit to fit its
cloth. According to this argument, provinces with the broadest and most
stable tax base would soon be offering the best social services.
Already, some are toying with the idea of health care user-fees. Under the
existing Canada Health Act, any province which imposes such levies forfeits
federal funding.
The looming debate on social programmes will clearly span a far wider range
of issues than how to get people off the dole and the welfare rolls.
Canadians also face some tough decisions about the kind of country they want
to live in.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Lower rates set off strong spending rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Lower US interest rates are sparking a strong increase in consumer spending
on durable goods, official figures indicated yesterday.
The Commerce Department said retail sales rose by 0.4 per cent last month
and by 7.1 per cent in the year to November. However, sales of durable goods
 -such as furniture, household equipment and building materials - rose by
0.9 per cent and 13.7 per cent in the same periods.
Car sales were down fractionally last month, following a 5 per cent gain
between September and October and a 14 per cent increase in the past year.
Durable goods are sensitive to interest rates because most consuemrs borrow
to finance most purchases.
The figures are not adjusted for inflation, which is running at an annual
rate of just under 3 per cent in the US.
Officials also sharply revised up sales figures for October to show a gain
of 1.8 per cent from September, rather than 1.5 per cent as previously
reported. Sales of durable goods rose a sharp 3.5 per cent.
The figures are the latest in a series of robust economic statistics,
including a sharp fall in the jobless rate to 6.4 per cent last month and
big increases in factory orders and production.
Mr David Munro of High Frequency Economics, a New York consultancy, said the
sales figures pointed to growth of real consumer spending at an annual rate
of 'at least 4.5 per cent' in the current quarter.
However, he added, a reduction in the pace of consumer spending was likely
early next year because real disposable incomes were growing at an annual
rate of only about 1 per cent. Retrenchment by consumers would lead to slow
down in real economic growth from an annual rate of about 4.5 per cent
currently to 2-3 per cent.

Police have recaptured a reputed drug baron who was among Brazil's most

Mr Abidiel Pinto Rabelo, 39, was seized by detectives on Monday in Campo
Grande, capital of the central state of Mato Grosso do Sul, when he left the
luxury house in which he was living with his family.
He went on the run last July after a gang of 10 armed men had released him
from police custody while he was returning from a dental appointment in Sao
Paulo to continue a 28-year jail term.
Rabelo was originally arrested in July 1991, when police found more than
half a ton of cocaine in a truck he was driving.
He is a suspected to be a member of the drug mafia in the far-western
Brazilian state of Rondonia, on the border with Bolivia.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Segregation revives in American schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Schools in the US are becoming more segregated by race, thus reversing 30
years of progress and of policy designed to produce more integrated
classrooms, says a new, federally commissioned study.
The Harvard Project on School Desegregation attributed its findings more to
higher birth rates and a new wave of immigration than to the flight of white
Americans to the suburbs.
Mr Gary Orfield, its director, gloomily concluded: 'The civil rights impulse
of the 1960s is dead in the water and the ship is floating backwards to the
shoals of racial segregation.'
The study found that 66 per cent of all black students and 74 per cent of
Hispanics attended 'predominantly minority' primary and secondary schools in
the 1991-92 academic year, the highest percentages for both communities
since 1968.
In 1954, the US Supreme Court ruled - in Brown vs the Topeka, Kansas, Board
of Education - that segregated education was unconstitutional. Flowing from
that landmark judgment, government policies, especially in the 1960s and
1970s, were primarily directed to promote integration, in some case by
court-ordered busing of school children.
These policies were substantially reversed by the Reagan administration. Mr
Orfield ascribed the study's findings to the delayed effect of this change
in approach.
The south, the target of the most bitter integration battles, is now less
segregated in education, but recent trends suggest it is moving in the same
way as the rest of the country.
The biggest concentration of segregated schools is found in the larger
cities, primarily in the north and north-east. In state terms, Illinois,
Michigan, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania contain the most
predominantly black schools; New York, New Jersey, Texas, California and
Illinois the most schools predominantly given over to Hispanic students.
The study makes the explicit, but unsurprising, link between poverty and the
concentration of minorities in schools. Black and Hispanic students, it
said, were much more likely to be in schools with poor academic records.
It recommends redrawing and enlarging school district boundaries to
encompass both inner cities and suburbs, thus making it possible for
students to have greater choice. It doubted that existing federal programmes
to improve the quality of inner city education were sufficient.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Ethanol to escape pollution formula
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration is poised to overturn its predecessor's decision
to include ethanol in a new petrol formula designed to reduce pollution.
The US Environmental Protection Agency is expected to announce tomorrow that
it will return to the formula originally negotiated with oil companies and
environmental groups in 1992, cancelling President George Bush's decision to
add ethanol.
Mr Bush's original decision was widely seen as an electoral concession to
maize growers, whose crops can be used to produce ethanol. Ethanol was a
sensitive issue in important electoral states such as Illinois.
Under the Clean Air Act, reformulated petrol which contains more oxygen, and
should therefore burn more cleanly, must be sold from 1995 onwards in nine
US cities with high smog levels. The reformulation programme could
eventually be extended to many other cities.
Ethanol is already incorporated in reformulated fuel sold in the winter in
cities with high levels of carbon monoxide, but the EPA has questioned
whether its use reduces other smog-forming chemicals.
The inclusion of ethanol can make petrol evaporate more rapidly, sending
polluting chemicals into the air. The Bush administration's decision,
therefore, would have shifted more of the cost of complying with the act on
to the shoulders of oil refiners, who would have had to develop a less
evaporative formula of petrol to offset the effects of the ethanol.
Ethanol has been strongly supported by a potent political coalition. Besides
corn-growers in the mid-western states, ethanol is heavily touted by
agribusiness companies such as Archer Daniels Midland, one of the most
generous contributors to the political campaign funds of both parties.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Bankruptcy debt up 25%: Sign of growing bad-loan burden
carried by banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Outstanding debts of Japan's corporate bankruptcies in November jumped 25.6
per cent from a year earlier to Y1,032bn (Pounds 6.3bn), a record for a
single month and a sign of the mounting bad loan burden carried by the
country's banks.
Teikoku Databank, the credit research agency, said the debt figure was
boosted by the collapse of Muramoto Construction, which owed about Y590bn,
but a continuing increase in recession-related bankruptcies is keeping the
failure rate at an unusually high level.
The agency said 1,176 companies failed during the month, a fall of 11.4 per
cent from a year earlier and 6.5 per cent from October.
Another sign of economic weakness released yesterday was a 10.5 per cent
fall year-on-year in Tokyo department-store sales during November, the third
consecutive month of double-digit decreases. The Japan Department Stores'
Association said clothing sales were 12.4 per cent lower and those of
household articles slipped 17.1 per cent.
The Economic Planning Agency suggests that a recovery in consumer spending
and capital investment will lead a broader recovery, but a 13.5 per cent
fall in machinery orders in October, against a year earlier, indicates that
companies are still reducing capital spending.
Compared to a month earlier, the EPA said private machinery orders dipped
15.2 per cent and those from the public sector fell 8 per cent, while
exports increased 2.4 per cent.
The Yamaichi Research Institute of Securities and Economics said Japan is
likely to have zero growth next year, if the yen remains at around Y110 to
the dollar, public works spending is increased by Y5,000bn and income taxes
are cut by Y6,000bn.

offers'. The number of job offers advertised at the Iidabashi Public
Employment Security Office has halved since two years ago. The number of job
seekers visiting the office each day has doubled in three years.
As the recessionary pressures facing the Japanese economy have continued
unabated, more companies are finding they can no longer afford to honour the
Japanese tradition of lifetime employment.
'Japanese companies do not lay off employees, because that is socially
unacceptable,' says Mr Kazutoshi Saiki, vice-chief of business at the
employment office. 'But there are a growing number of people, older men in
particular, who are being encouraged to retire early. And when that happens,
it becomes too uncomfortable for them to stay with their company.'
Officially, unemployment in Japan is 2.7 per cent - still moderate compared
with the west. The ratio of job openings to job seekers throughout the
country has reached 0.67, the lowest in more than six years.
At Iidabashi there are still 1.32 job offers per job seeker but it is
especially difficult for two groups of people - general office workers and
those over 40.
To a larger extent than in the past, growing unemployment in Japan is a
white-collar problem. Most of those flipping through folders or talking to
staff behind the counters at the employment office in Iidabashi are
middle-aged navy-suited men, and women both young and old. For general
office workers, the jobs to job seekers' ratio is as low as 0.32. Two-thirds
of calls received by an employment hotline set up by an association of
lawyers in mid-November, were from men and women over 45.
When hiring from outside, most Japanese companies value personality, ability
to fit in with the group or attitude to work above qualifications or past
experience. It is also felt that paying an outsider an attractive salary
could damage the morale of long-serving employees who are having to work
their way up the corporate ladder.
As a result, people looking for a second career often feel that the pay and
status being offered to a newcomer fail to reflect their true worth.
Furthermore, companies seeking extra employees are medium- to smaller
businesses which generally cannot meet the more attractive conditions
offered by larger companies.
Things are likely to get worse before they gets better. According to a
Labour Ministry survey of manufacturing companies last month, nearly half
said they felt the strains of excess labour.
Mr Saiki argues that the Japanese employment system, which creates general
managers rather than specialists and which prizes loyalty over
qualifications, has created this mismatch between job seekers and jobs
available. Unless Japanese society itself changes, things will not improve
for middle-aged people looking for new jobs, he says.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Four companies fined Y4m each over bid-rigging
</HEADLINE>

Japanese legal authorities yesterday convicted and fined four printing
companies for violating anti-monopoly rules by rigging bids for contracts
with a government agency.
The Tokyo High Court convicted Dainippon Printing, Japan's largest printing
company, as well as Toppan Moore, Hitachi Information Systems and Kobayashi
Kirokushi of rigging bids for sticker supply contracts with the Social
Insurance Agency and imposed fines of Y4m (Pounds 25,100) each.
The conviction comes against a background of persistent criticism by the US
that Japan's anti-monopoly rules were too lax, and pressure to strengthen
enforcement of its anti-monopoly act particularly against exclusionist trade
practices such as bid-rigging.
US officials have been particularly critical of alleged bid-rigging by
Japanese construction companies of public works contracts. However, no
conviction has ever been made against bid-rigging in the construction
industry despite several orders by the Fair Trade Commission against
construction companies to stop such practices.
Judge Masayoshi Kondo described the case as particularly serious because the
convicted parties continued to rig bids in defiance of the FTC order and
with the sole purpose of sharing the profits among themselves.
The bid-rigging by the companies cost the agency and taxpayers Y420m in
damages in fiscal 1992 alone, he said. The fine of Y4m each is close to the
maximum Y5m for cases brought prior to January when the maximum penalty was
raised to Y100m.
The US has been highly critical of the Japanese practice of designated
bidding, which creates an environment that easily allows bid-rigging. The
High Court in its ruling noted that the Social Insurance Agency had
inadvertently co-operated by narrowing the number of designated bidders and
basing its assumed successful bids on the estimates submitted by them.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Digging for a new identity: Robert Thomson on life without
coal in northern Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Surrounded by pieces of timber that were to be fashioned into a wooden box,
the former coal miner forced together the tongues and grooves of two sides
that would not quite fit. He crouched with a dozen other men who had shared
a mine shaft until last year, all attempting a conversion to carpentry in
the hope of finding an income and a life after coal.
Changing identity in Japan does not come easy. These miners had always
introduced themselves by company name first, Mitsui, and family name second.
They had a clear hierarchy in the mine shaft, a hierarchy dismantled on the
retraining room floor, where each pair of calloused hands starts with the
same planks of wood and is judged on the symmetry of a completed box.
The coal miners of Ashibetsu, in northern Japan, could be unwitting
trend-setters. Just as Mitsui has closed an unprofitable mine, Japanese
manufacturers are contemplating closing loss-making factories and wondering
where to put middle-aged administrative workers, who still hope their
company will keep the promise of lifetime employment.
As the miners must cope with a change in occupation, small communities which
have lost an old identity are attempting to fashion a new one. In Ashibetsu,
they have a saying 'from tanko to kanko', from coal mines to tourism, which
is supposed to replace the black stuff as the fuel of local wealth.
Theme parks are a popular choice for local governments casting around for a
new character, and Ashibetsu has built a Canadian Village. Its claim to fame
is Japan's largest lavender field, but it is far from Tokyo and for much of
the winter the park is snowed under and the six imported Canadians are idle.
An hour's drive away, another town has built a German theme village and the
countryside is dotted with little bits of other countries. But, in
Ashibetsu, the coffee shop in the town's centre still has a lump of coal on
a pedestal, and the local candy comes in the shape of just-mined coal.
Mr Katsuhiro Tainaka, aged 54, now a trainee carpenter, was among the last
373 miners at Mitsui Ashibetsu. He was the local organiser for the regional
head of the miners' union, a position of subservience and of importance: 'I
guess it's a Japanese way of looking at things, but he was my lord and I
would still do absolutely anything for him.'
Having worked in a mine for 35 years, Mr Tainaka is adjusting his vision to
the harsh light above ground. His wife Kazue says he eats less but has
already put on nearly half a stone and looks pudgy: 'When he was working, I
would cook plate after plate of food, and he would just eat and eat. He
would be too tired to talk.'
The couple met on a holiday camp run by the Lenin Society three decades ago,
when miners were adopted as popular symbols of the working man by the
country's communists. In those days, Mr Tainaka thought a revolution
inevitable, but the union and the company gradually merged. When Mitsui
announced that the mine would have to close, the miners understood that
cheap imports had made them redundant and accepted the decision.
Mr Tainaka keeps his mining hat on the mantelpiece, beside the shining
blackness of a coal lump that he hauled out before the shaft was closed.
Playing with a grandson occupies his time, but his income has fallen by more
than half and the loss of mateship is more damaging: 'When you are in a
mine, people depend on you. You can't make a mistake. You have to work
together.'
Of the workmates with him at the end, a third have left town, a third have
new jobs, and about a third are being retrained. Two have committed suicide.
The Tainakas have stayed in the mining company apartment, but most of the
blocks lining the town's roads are empty and sales in local stores have
fallen about 20 per cent this year.
Shopkeepers complain that a new road intended to be Ashibetsu's lifeline is
strangling them. Instead of shopping locally, Mr Tainaka and other residents
drive 40 minutes to the nearest city, where cheaper discount stores outside
the old distribution networks have sprouted in the past two years.
The speculative binge of the late 1980s bypassed Ashibetsu, but the area is
nonetheless suffering trauma. Investment losses have put large companies
under extra pressure to close local factories and to halt fresh investments,
leaving a just-finished industrial park waiting for its first customer. And
the yen's appreciation this year means Ashibetsu is up against northern
China and Thailand in the tough contest for scarce funds.
Local governments have not lost enthusiasm. Mikasa city, another old coal
mining centre in central Hokkaido, has a population of 16,126 and is
shedding people at the rate of 400 a year. Mr Ginichi Aoki, the mayor,
delivers a vivid description of Mikasa's bright future. He spreads maps out
on the table, and points to the high-tech centre, the culture zone, the
industrial parks and the tourism belt.
'I am going to Tokyo this weekend to tell a mayors' conference about our
plans. We are determined to attract people to live and visit here. We will
make this a happy place,' Mr Aoki insists.
Outside his office, a traffic signal's electronic chirping beckons absent
pedestrians to cross. A banner hanging across the front of the civic centre
proclaims that the town is aiming for 500 days without a road accident. Of
all the grand plans, that is the most attainable in Mikasa's empty streets.

Richer governments responsible for most of the flow of official aid to

world with newer aid demands from eastern Europe, writes David Buchan in
Paris.
The Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development said it was putting eight of the poorest
republics of the former Soviet Union on its list of countries receiving
'official development assistance'. Such aid would count towards the pledge
of OECD governments to try to raise their aid budgets to 0.7 per cent of
national output.
Donors yesterday promised Zimbabwe enough official aid to bridge its 1994
financing gap of some Dollars 789m, but urged Harare to continue
liberalising, cut public spending and foster investment.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Arafat visits London with Mideast peace in balance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, arrived
in London on a two-day official visit yesterday with the future of the
Middle East peace process finely balanced.
The PLO and Israel agreed on Monday that negotiations over the
implementation of the September 13 declaration of principles were in crisis
following the fruitless meeting between Mr Arafat and Mr Yitzhak Rabin,
Israel's prime minister, in Cairo at the weekend.
The two sides had set a target of December 13 for the start of Israeli troop
withdrawals from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho. But the
talks have foundered over the control of border crossings, the size of the
territory to be administered by the Palestinians around Jericho, and the
Israeli troop presence required to protect Jewish settlers in Gaza.
The two leaders have agreed to meet again before the end of next week and Mr
Arafat repeated yesterday that he was still hopeful an agreement could be
reached.
The failure of Israel to begin the troop withdrawal as scheduled has sparked
bitterness among Palestinians in the occupied territories, where violence
again flared yesterday with two Arabs shot dead in Gaza and another 12
wounded during clashes with Israeli forces.
Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, yesterday urged Mr Arafat to be
firm in opposition to violence and to reassure Israelis the risk they had
taken for peace was reciprocated. He also urged the PLO to persuade Arab
countries to relax the trade boycott against Israel and to build up
bilateral contacts as soon as possible.
Before leaving Strasbourg for London yesterday, Mr Arafat said that the
entire credibility of the peace process would be a stake if Israel failed to
honour the April 13 deadline for completing its military withdrawal from
Gaza and Jericho. The PLO leader was responding to a statement from Mr Rabin
in which the Israeli leader stressed there was nothing sacred about any of
the dates set out in the declaration of principles signed in Washington.
If Mr Rabin said that, 'there is doubt for the credibility of the peace
process,' added Mr Arafat. The PLO leader is due today to hold talks with Mr
John Major, the UK prime minister, before leaving for Dublin.
Meanwhile the remaining 215 Palestinian deportees from the 415 who were
expelled a year ago from the occupied territories to southern Lebanon, were
informed by Israel that they could return home today. Most support radical
Islamic groups.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Japan trade surplus falls back from peak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's trade surplus has peaked after three years of uninterrupted
expansion, as import growth outpaced exports during November and the surplus
fell 2.2 per cent year-on-year to Dollars 7.398bn (Pounds 4.95bn).
The Ministry of Finance said the turnround reflected the influence of the
yen's appreciation by 14 per cent against the dollar this year, adding that
the surplus should continue to shrink in coming months.
Japanese trade officials hope the contraction of the surplus will be matched
by an easing of trade friction, as the large and growing figure had been a
target for criticism by the US and Europe.
The fall in the surplus follows a gradual reduction in year-on-year
increases in recent months. In July, the surplus expanded by 28.7 per cent,
in August 6.7 per cent, September 3.8 per cent and October 0.91 per cent.
Exports during November rose 4.1 per cent to Dollars 28.38bn, while imports
rose 6.4 per cent to Dollars 20.99bn, reflecting an increase in component
imports from the east Asian factories of Japanese manufacturers.
Trade with China continued to expand rapidly, regardless of Beijing's
attempts to cool its economy. Japan's exports to China rose 19.6 per cent,
while imports from China rose 33.3 per cent, including a 62 per cent
increase in machinery imports.
Japan's seasonally-adjusted exports slipped 3.9 per cent, while imports rose
2.9 per cent from a month earlier and the surplus was Dollars 8.81bn,
compared to Dollars 10.51bn in October.
The surplus in trade with Washington continued to expand during November, as
exports to the US increased 8.3 per cent to Dollars 8.84bn and imports rose
only 4.3 per cent to Dollars 4.54bn. However, the surplus with the European
Union decreased for the 10th consecutive month, falling 36.2 per cent to
Dollars 988.1m.
Demand from the US computer industry lifted exports of semiconductor parts
by 42.5 per cent, while exports contracted of colour television sets,
videocassette recorders, and audio equipment, all of which are increasingly
produced elsehwere in Asia by Japanese manufacturers.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Indian brokers start protest strike

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Indian stockbrokers went on strike yesterday in protest at a decision by the
Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), the market watchdog, to
suspend forward trading in securities.
The authorities imposed the ban on Monday in an attempt to slow a rapid
surge in share prices, up 29 per cent from early November as investors
rushed back into the market in large numbers for the first time since last
year's Rs40bn (Pounds 850m) Bombay securities market scandal.
The intervention triggered a sharp sell-off on kerb (unofficial) markets and
on the Madras Stock Exchange, the only exchange which stayed open yesterday,
where the local index fell 3 per cent.
The autumn rally, which took the Bombay Stock Exchange's index of leading
stocks to an 18-month high, was started by overseas investors buying shares
for the first time since India last year opened its stock market to
foreigners.
The authorities acted this week out of concern that too many local investors
are trying to take advantage of this wave of foreign buying by trading in
the forward market, where purchasers can carry outstanding purchases from
one settlement period to the next without paying for them in full, and so
can acquire control of large volumes of shares with relatively little money.
The informal forward market, which accounts for 70 to 90 per cent of trades,
has long been a target of Sebi's attention. Officials believe its operations
allow infringements of securities regulations to be disguised. Brokers say
the market, called badla, is vital for efficient trading.
Officials are particularly anxious to avoid a repetition of last year's
scandal in which money was illegally siphoned from banks and invested in
speculative stock market trading.
A parliamentary committee is completing a report into the affair which is
expected to pin some blame on the authorities for failing to monitor the
markets adequately.
The last time the forward market was suspended was during last year's
scandal. This time Sebi has put no time limit on its order. It has
instructed brokers to clear half their forward positions by January 6 and
the rest by January 20.
Brokers are furious at the board's action because forward trading accounts
account for much of their business. Foreign investors expressed concern that
the board's intervention increased the uncertainties of investing in India
but added that the liquidation of forward positions would increase the
supply of stock to long-term investors. Mr Mark Bullough, director of the
Indian operation of Jardine Fleming, the international investment bank,
said: 'Overall, foreign financial institutions do not appear unduly
concerned by this particular regulatory change.'

Pakistan yesterday set a deadline for resolution of a dispute over US arms
sales and said it would go shopping elsewhere if the matter remains
unresolved beyond next April.
Mr Assef Ahmad Ali, foreign minister, told three visiting US senators
Pakistan would look to other countries if the US arms sales, suspended three
years ago, are not restored. Islamabad has already paid over more than
Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) to buy items including 71 F-16 fighter aircraft.
'No country can allow its security to be compromised,' Mr Ali said after
meeting the delegation including Senator Larry Pressler, who sponsored the
amendment requiring the US president to verify Islamabad was not capable of
producing nuclear weapons before economic and military aid could could be
given.
Last month, the White House sent a draft law to congress which would the
president greater freedom to back aid to any recipient country, if that
would promote US interests. Pakistan sees that as a breakthrough in having
aid restored.

South Africa's multi-party Transitional Executive Council yesterday set
itself on collision course with right-wing parties, threatening legal action
against the KwaZulu black 'homeland' of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi and
blocking a development loan to nominally independent Bophuthatswana.
The African National Congress, which dominates the TEC together with its
political allies, has been flexing its muscles in the council since its
installation a week ago.
Last week, the ANC provoked a showdown with the government by insisting the
TEC urge withdrawal of the Internal Stability Unit from the Bhambayi
squatter camp, Natal, and the East Rand townships near Johannesburg.
Yesterday, Mr Hernus Kriel, law and order minister, agreed to withdraw all
but a token ISU force from Bhambayi. A decision on the East Rand was delayed
pending talks between police and residents.
Another showdown with the government loomed over whether police will be
deployed in northern Natal, as demanded by the TEC last week. Such
deployments would bring the TEC into confrontation with the KwaZulu
government, which administers parts of northern Natal as a self-governing
state.
ANC officials admit the TEC cannot force Mr Kriel to act (it can only
recommend action), but they want to show the TEC has power in policing,
which is important to free and fair elections. But sending police to
northern Natal could provoke conflict with KwaZulu, which rejects the TEC's
authority.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Return to ERM bands ruled out

<TEXT>
Creation of a single European Union currency does not depend on a formal
return to the tight movement bands of the exchange rate mechanism, according
to Mr Henning Christophersen, economic affairs commissioner, Reuter reports
from Brussels.
'You cannot exclude that a group of countries could go into Emu (economic
and monetary union) stage three without having formally re-entered the
narrow bands,' a European Commission spokesman quoted Mr Christophersen as
telling Danish journalists.
But he said Mr Christophersen stressed that currencies still had to be
stable and close to their central rates in the European Union's system of
semi-fixed exchange rates.
Mr Christophersen's comments mark a policy shift for the Commission.
The EU's executive has always insisted that there had to be a formal move
back to the grid's narrow bands before a single currency could be created.
EC finance ministers gave in to more than a year of money market turmoil on
August 2 and opened the currency grid's fluctuation bands to 15 per cent
either side of central rates from 2.25 or 6 per cent.
Only Germany and The Netherlands held on to their 2.25 per cent bands under
an informal deal.
The move prompted speculation that the EU's timetable for creating a single
currency in 1997 or by 1999 had become more fantasy than fact.
Senior EU monetary figures say a formal tightening of the bands could not
take place in the near future and in any case would simply serve to offer
money markets easier targets.
They have said that the most sensible way forward is for countries to set up
informal support agreements with each other along the lines of the
German-Dutch deal as the ERM's hard core begins to crystalise. Since August
2 both the Belgian and the French francs have crept back inside the narrow
band and the Danish crown is sitting just outside. In effect, the so-called
hard core has virtually re-formed itself.
One monetary committee member said last week this proved formally setting
the narrow bands had itself been a mistake and should not be repeated.

FT  15 DEC 93 / EU banks warned on money transfers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
People ought to be able to transfer money from one European Union country to
another more quickly and cheaply, to subscribe to a foreign newspaper or buy
goods by mail order, the European Commission said yesterday, Reuter reports
from Brussels.
And it was ready to force banks to comply if they failed to do so of their
own accord.
Transferring 100 European currency units cost on average Ecu24 (Pounds
18.28) at the beginning of 1993 and took almost five days, according to a
study carried out by the Commission. This was unacceptable if the EU's
single market for goods, money and people was to be meaningful, the
Commission said in a statement.
'European consumers are right to complain about the current situation on
cross-border payments. It is a field where the great market has got to
benefit citizens,' the statement quoted Mrs Christiane Scrivener, the
commissioner in charge on consumer policy, as saying. The Commission
approved an action plan yesterday which could culminate in the adoption next
summer of measures to force the banks to act if a study to be carried out
early in 1994 showed that no concrete progress had been made.
'The Commission gives the banks a 'grace period' to allow for more
transparency and efficiency when making cross-border payments,' the
statement said.
International transfers of money are expensive because they involve manual
operations often involving more than two banks. This means that costs are
charged not to the sender but also the beneficiary. There are more than 200m
cross-border payments below Ecu2,500 in the EU each year but they account
for only 1.3 per cent of total banking transactions, according to 1991
figures.
However, the banking industry continues to contest the Commission's right to
impose rules on its operations.

Eight people were killed and 10 were wounded in a heavy mortar and artillery
attack on central Sarajevo yesterday, the latest in a series of relatively
isolated but deadly attacks on the besieged Bosnian capital, Reuter reports
from Sarajevo.
Doctors at Kosevo hospital, the main casualty centre, said five women and
three men were killed when two mortar rounds landed near the Drvenija bridge
and near the barracks of the Egyptian UN brigade. A Bosnian soldier was
killed by a sniper in the Vogosca district.
The latest fighting has forced UN peacekeepers to close the airport, which
is under their control. Fierce fighting was also reported in central Bosnia.
Moslem troops launched a heavy artillery and mortar attack on Croat
positions around Zepce.

Mercedes-Benz said last night it would build its new A-class 'Baby Benz'
city car at its Rastatt plant in Germany rather than at other sites it had
considered in Britain, France or the Czech Republic, Reuter reports from
Bonn.
The company said that management and the works council had agreed on the
site after long and difficult negotiations.
Mercedes said it would give further information at a press conference
scheduled for this morning by its parent company, Daimler-Benz.
In the talks on the plant's site, the works council and unions favoured the
Rastatt plant, which was completed last year. According to analysts it is
under-utilised.
Mercedes, worried about plummeting sales and profits, favoured other,
lower-cost sites, company sources said.
Analysts said Mercedes had to be extremely careful with costs for the
A-Class because it would be competing in a high-volume market where profit
margins are very small.
The IG Metall engineering union had threatened reprisals if Rastatt were not
chosen.
The A-Class, due to go into production in 1997, will be built at a rate of
about 200,000 a year and 2,500 workers will be employed.

Until now, Austria had been relatively free of the racist violence seen
elsewhere in Europe.
Many Austrians have grown increasingly concerned at the large influx of
immigrants since the collapse of the communism in eastern and central Europe
and the onset of the civil war in the former Yugoslavia, but the letter-bomb
campaign shocked a public unused to political violence and brought
widespread sympathy for the victims.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Czech voucher sell-off improves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Public interest in the Czech Republic's second wave of mass voucher
privatisation has surpassed official expectations, with more than 6m Czechs
out of a total population of 10.3m having registered for voucher books by
the December 8 deadline, according to preliminary government figures.
After a slow start, which encouraged the government to extend the original
deadline by one week, investor interest picked up sharply. Mr Ivan Kocarnik,
finance minister, said a strong advertising campaign on television and radio
helped to boost interest.
Analysts say the high take-up level for voucher books should ensure the
privatisation programme's success. Shares in some 770 companies, with an
estimated book value of CzK145bn (Pounds 3.4bn), will be sold in the current
wave. The Czech government considers voucher privatisation the most
effective and quickest way to reform the Czech economy and to transfer state
assets into private hands, with restructuring being left to the new owners
of privatised companies.
For individual Czech investors, voucher privatisation offers a sure gain at
little cost. A voucher book costs CzK1,000, on top of which there is a small
registration fee, but on average they can hope to gain CzK20,000-CzK30,000
in return for their investment once the vouchers have been exchanged into
shares.

FT  15 DEC 93 / SPD-union plan for chemicals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's embattled chemical industry, facing soaring costs from tough
environmental legislation, was yesterday offered a new plan to secure its
long-term future.
The opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the 800,000-strong chemical
workers' union, IG Chemie, published a joint paper seeking to reconcile the
demands of strict environmental controls with the need to preserve jobs in
the sector.
Key recommendations include the simplification of environmental legislation,
acceleration of planning procedures to speed up the introduction of
environmentally-friendly products, and a clear timetable for the
introduction of tougher rules on the avoidance and disposal of harmful waste
products.
At the same time, the SPD remains firmly committed to tougher environmental
controls, including the use of criminal legislation to prosecute offenders.
The joint paper, published with top-level support from Mr Rudolf Scharping,
the SPD leader, and Mr Hermann Rappe, leader of IG Chemie, the chemical
workers' union, amounts to clear recognition of the unique problems facing
the industry because of Germany's strict environmental legislation. The SPD,
which is heavily involved in policing the industry through its control of a
majority of Germany's 16 federal states, wants to introduce new
environmental tax reforms aimed at promoting 'ecological and economic
innovation'. IG Chemie is clearly concerned at the employment implications
for the industry, and stresses instead the need for a working group
involving other groups to define the precise aims of such new tax reforms.
Both sides agree that the problems of the German chemical industry are not
simply a result of excessive costs arising from the whole range of
environmental standards, but rather a reflection of inadequate research and
investment in environmentally-friendly techniques.
They argue that the German chemical industry will only be able to compete
successfully on the international market if it remains at the forefront of
environmental technology. But they agree on the need for a reduction of red
tape.
'What is required is an increase in transparency, and acceleration of
procedures,' they say. 'One aim might be the creation of a single volume of
environmental legislation.' They also propose an enquiry to identify the
most serious bottlenecks in new investment in the industry.

FT  15 DEC 93 / France's welfare deficit worsens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The financial hole in France's welfare system will reach FFr57bn (Pounds
6.5bn) this year and, despite tax increases and cuts in medical and pension
payments, will still be around FFr43bn next year, a government commission
reported yesterday.
France's welfare funds are still largely funded off-budget by employer and
employee contributions, though the state is now having to dig into its own
pocket to provide about one-fifth of this year's estimated FFr1,027bn
welfare spending. Thus, the government has been able to keep this year's
budget deficit at its original target of FFr317bn, while the welfare funds
sink deeper into the red.
Recession, rising unemployment and stagnation in salary levels has meant
that this year's increase in total receipts of the pensions, family
allowances, health and accident insurance funds rose only 2.3 per cent,
barely matching inflation, while payments increased by 6.4 per cent. 'The
social security system is suffering the biggest financial crisis of its
history at the very time when it is most needed,' said Mr Jean Marmot, head
of the social security accounts commission.
The long-term strategy of the government is to shift more of the welfare tax
burden off company payrolls and on to the national budget funded by general
taxation. To this end, it has already doubled the 'generalised social
contribution', a form of income tax, and is being urged by some of its
backbench deputies to raise value added tax as a means of bailing out the
welfare funds. But, clearly nervous that further tax increases might kill
off the incipient economic recovery, Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, the budget
minister, said this week that introduction of a 'social VAT' was premature.
The unemployment insurance fund is counted separately from other welfare
funds. But it, too, is in the red. In a move to combat rising joblessness,
the Patronat employers' federation, which together with the trade unions
finances and manages the nation's dole fund, set its member companies the
goal of hiring up to 200,000 young people by the end of 1994.

FT  15 DEC 93 / VW expects Seat pact today: Closure of Barcelona plant will
cost Germans some Pta30bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Volkswagen, the German car group, is expected to secure agreement today to
close down the Barcelona plant of Seat, its loss-making Spanish subsidiary.
The deal, between Seat's management, the unions and the local authorities,
is also to shed temporarily 40 per cent of the company's labour force, a
total of 9,000 jobs, in the biggest single lay-off in Spain's industrial
history.
The struggle by the German giant to reach agreement for the closure of
Seat's sprawling and mostly obsolete Zona Franca factory on the city's
outskirts has been costly as well as time-consuming and marked by strikes
and by clashes with riot police in central Barcelona.
Seat has three plants in Spain and it opened a new plant west of Barcelona
earlier this year. The attempt to streamline Seat has sharply illustrated
both the rigidities of Spanish labour legislation, which the government
intends to reform, and the power of Spain's trade unions, which have called
for a 24-hour general strike next month to protest against the government's
reforms plans.
Under the terms said to have been agreed yesterday with unions, management
and the regional government, Seat is committed to re-employing within two
years 4,600 workers who have fixed employment contracts, and it is bound to
make up unemployment benefits to ensure that the laid-off workers will be
receiving at least 80 per cent of their take home pay.
The cost of the settlement, which includes Pta5m (Pounds 24,500) cash
payments for employees accepting early retirement, is conservatively
estimated to be costing Volkswagen's Spanish unit Pta30bn and could
represent as much again for Spain's hard-pressed social security system.
The management, which hopes that part of its laid-off labour force will be
absorbed by a components manufacturing industrial park that is scheduled to
occupy the site of the Zona Franca plant, had initially refused to guarantee
re-hiring employees and baulked at adding to the unemployment benefits.
Apparently rattled by the violent drift that Seat worker demonstrations were
taking in central Barcelona, the Catalonian government last week persuaded
the company's management to raise its terms, gaining a grudging union assent
to the lay-offs.
The irony of the settlement is that it could have been considerably less
costly for the management had it been able to wait for the government's
planned labour market reforms before implementing the cutbacks. But the
company wanted to act swiftly - in the first nine months this year it posted
losses of Pta87bn, and Volkswagen has made a Pta120bn cash injection to
rescue Seat's 1993 balance sheet conditional on the closure of the Barcelona
plant before the end of this year.
The draft of the government's labour reform law, which is expected to be on
the statute book by next summer, allows companies to reduce their labour
force for organisational and production reasons - both of which could be
plausibly argued by Seat following the opening of its new plant - and to pay
off redundant workers with 20 days of salary per year worked up to a maximum
of 42 months of pay.
Had this new legislation been in place two years ago, when Seat was making
money and planning to shift its production out of its Barcelona base, the
car producer could have adjusted its labour force far less painfully.
Under the current labour legislation, a company has to argue impending
bankruptcy, as Seat has done over the past two months, before it can lay off
workers. Or it must be prepared to pay unfair dismissal settlements which by
law represent a minimum of 45 days of salary per year worked - an expense
that is even greater than the lay-off procedure chosen by Seat.

Gazprom, the Russian company which controls the world's largest gas

require technical expertise unavailable in the country.
Mr Rem Vyakhirev, Gazprom chairman, told a Financial Times conference in
Vienna yesterday that there 'would be no question of any direct foreign
investment or profit sharing' in projects in which current Russian
technology was adequate.
He said the restrictions applied both to exploration and production of gas
reserves as well as to pipeline and other distribution systems. But Gazprom
might utilise foreign finance for such projects, he said.
Direct foreign participation was welcome, however, in higher-risk
developments. These were defined as those in which the 'geologic or climatic
challenges' required more advanced technology than that available in Russia.
'In those cases we would be willing to work at all stages with foreigners,'
Mr Vyakhirev said.
Gazprom is increasingly looking to remote Siberian and Arctic sites, such as
the Yamal Peninsula, as well as to the largely unexplored northern Russian
continental shelf, for future reserves.
Mr Vyakhirev yesterday confirmed that current prices paid by western
European customers for Russian gas were inadequate to support the
development of such areas.
He also questioned whether it was wise to open up the Russian pipeline
system to allow other producers in the former Soviet Union to deliver their
gas to western Europe.
'The system is already over-committed,' he said. 'we are putting money into
expansion . . . access should mean investment.'
Mr Vyakhirev said Gazprom intends to expand the southern pipeline route to
western Europe which passes through Ukraine. This is despite the 'serious
problems' which have arisen between Moscow and Kiev over the pipeline, and a
proposal to build a new line to western Europe through Belarus and Poland.

change

The World Bank has agreed to modify its loan policies in a move that could
open the way to a wave of new lending to Russia and the other states of the
former Soviet Union.
Its executive board yesterday voted to establish a negative pledge clause
waiver allowing Russia to pledge assets such as oil revenues as security for
loans from other lenders.
If no objections are heard by the close of business today, Russia will be
able to move immediately forward with a Dollars 2bn loan from the US
Export-Import Bank for its oil and gas industry.
'This action has the practical effect of allowing an infusion of capital
into Russia at a crucial time in that country's development,' said Mr
Kenneth Brody, Eximbank's president. Uzbekistan will also receive the
waiver.
In Washington, officials said the board meeting had been scheduled for some
time and its timing was not directly linked to the Russian election.
World Bank policy normally requires borrowing countries to sign a negative
pledge waiver, certifying that they will not pledge their assets to any
other lender. This requirement helps to ensure that the World Bank ranks at
the top of the list of creditors to any country and to preserve its credit
rating.
The policy has, however, hampered the flow of capital into Russia since
investors have been uncertain about repayment.
The World Bank had agreed in principle in March to lift the negative pledge
clause, but restricted the circumstances in which it will grant a waiver to
apply principally to the former Communist countries in transition to a
market economy.
The conditions required the implementation of a programme of macro-economic
adjustment, but yesterday the board agreed to accept evidence that a country
was making progress towards a market economy and privatisation.
The waiver will also be granted for only two years, rather than the three
years originally planned.

The Clinton administration was yesterday reassessing, with growing concern,
its policies towards Russia.
Officials travelling with Vice President Al Gore, who arrived in Moscow
yesterday, conceded that the successes of the nationalist and Communist
parties and the worse-than-expected performance of the reformist groups
raised serious doubts about whether President Boris Yeltsin could achieve a
working relationship with the new parliament.
In Washington, the State Department spokesman for the first time directly
attacked Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the nationalist leader, for holding views
which were 'anathema to our principles of democracy, human rights and the
democratic process, economic reform and relations amiong sovereign states'.
On Monday, both President Bill Clinton and Mr Gore had taken consolation in
the fact that the new Russian constitution, enhancing presidential
authority, had been approved at the polls. Mr Clinton said Russian democracy
had a new foundation and he was not particularly surprised at the rise of
the nationalist groups given the recent suffering of the Russian people.
Mr Gore, en route from Kazakhstan, even expressed the hope that if the
reformers could bury their differences and assemble even a narrow
parliamentary majority, then Russia could still be on course to a market
economy.
But the latest election returns have dampened even this guarded optimism. Mr
Gore himself was reduced to comparing what might happen in the Russian
parliament with the US Congress, where floating and narrow majorities on
specific issues had become the order of the day.
Other officials travelling with him were less philosophical. One was quoted
as saying that the results were 'very bad' and 'a dramatic change'.
Another noted that US policies were geared as much towards promoting
economic reform as they were to supporting Mr Yeltsin. 'If one part of the
government is against reform, we could not support it,' he said.
Washington post-mortems were conspicuous for criticism of Mr Yeltsin for
misjudging the electoral climate and deciding to stay above the fray. He
was, it was freely said, the only populist counterweight to Mr Vladimir
Zhirinovsky, and his refusal to campaign actively for Russia's Choice, his
preferred party, had given the nationalist leader an opportunity to
capitalise on popular discontent.
The unspoken hope was that Mr Yeltsin would not take up the option of facing
Mr Zhirinovsky in a presidential election next year but seek to soldier on
until 1996, by which time economic reforms might be producing dividends.
The State Department spokesman implied there was very little practical
alternative to the US continuing to deal principally with the executive
branch in Moscow. US contact with other power centres, specifically the
nationalists and the Communists, has been minimal.
Foreign policy concerns were given an airing yesterday when Mr Warren
Christopher, secretary of state, met Mr Andrej Olechowski, the Polish
foreign minister, who has been outspoken in demanding a closer relationship
between eastern European countries and Nato, up to the point of eventual
membership.

FT  15 DEC 93 / The Russian Elections: Local officials gain a national
platform - Some of the president's old foes have won seats on the federation
council

The first results of voting for the federation council - the new
parliament-to-be's upper house and the one which represents the interests of
the regions - show it to be overwhelmingly filled with representatives of
the regional nomenklatura.
Of different persuasions, they are all there, above all, to lobby for their
regions. They also include some old foes, both of President Boris Yeltsin
and of the reformers.
Mr Aman Tuleev, leader of Kemerovo, comes in on a big vote. He gave some of
the most virulent anti-Yeltsin speeches in the former parliament. From
Sverdlovsk comes Mr Eduard Rossel, the former governor sacked by Mr Yeltsin
for attempting to make his region a new Urals republic.
Two of the men alleged to have masterminded the abortive coup in August 1991
are in. Still untried, they are Mr Vasily Starodubtsev and Mr Anatoly
Lukyanov. From the republic of Kalmykia comes the millionaire president, Mr
Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, who before the suppression of the last parliament
attempted to organise anti-Yeltsin sentiment outside it.
There are also reformers, like the first deputy prime minister, Mr Vladimir
Shumeiko, from Kaliningrad. But the largest part of the parliament will be
of uncertain political allegiance, capable of being mobilised both for and
against the president and the government.
For some, such as Mr Rossel and the leaders of many of the republics, the
constitutional issue will be given pride of place. The Russian constitution,
now embedded in law, is clear that all areas are subordinate to the federal
levels of power. However, some have already claimed sovereignty within
constitutions which they themselves have adopted.
This is an issue which, like many others, has been finessed until now, but
which will rise again all the more strongly now that the republican leaders
have a democratic mandate and a pulpit from which to state their case.
In the single mandate seats for the lower house, or state duma - being half
the 450 seats elected on a first-past-the-post system rather than on party
lists - the situation is also unclear. Russia's Choice, the main reformist
party, believes it has done much better here than in the half elected by
party lists, which is dominated by Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's Liberal
Democratic party.
In part this was for the negative reason that the central electoral
commission banned the mention of any party affiliation, and thus people
voted for the best-known name - many of whom were democrats - rather than
for an anti-reform party which they might otherwise have preferred.
However, the disorganisation among the democrats showed itself here as well.
In the Central Petersburg district, the nationalist television presenter Mr
Alexander Nevzorov came first past the post with 25 per cent of the vote,
while the two democratic candidates took almost double between them. The
latter, from Russia's Choice and the Yabloko grouping, apparently disliked
each other more than they did the prospect of Mr Nevzorov's victory.

FT  15 DEC 93 / The Russian Elections: New man of power pulls on velvet
gloves - Zhirinovsky tones down the rhetoric for Chrystia Freeland and John
Lloyd
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND and JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'We are ready to serve in the cabinet,' said Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky
yesterday, emphatic behind his large desk. 'I would, with great reluctance,
be prepared to be prime minister, but better if others were.'
The leader of the Liberal Democratic party (LDP) was holding court in his
fourth floor party headquarters. The man to whom Russia and much of the
world looks - with hope or fear - for a sign of what he will do with his
victory is clear as to his tactics: he wants power, and power at the very
centre of the state.
His reluctance to be prime minister is probably genuine. His
second-in-command, Mr Alexander Vengerovsky - who sits a little to his side,
with a licence to speak - is being promoted as the party's choice for the
post they believe they deserve. Beyond that, according to Mr Zhirinovsky,
they will claim the posts of foreign, defence, security and interior
ministers: the 'power ministries' responsible for order and external
relations.
They will demand that the present holders resign - especially hated is Mr
Andrei Kozyrev, foreign minister - and that Mr Yegor Gaidar, first deputy
premier, and Mr Anatoly Chubais, deputy premier for privatisation, go too.
The first bill they will promote in the lower house (state duma) when they
take their seats in January is one establishing a national guard. This, for
all the moderation they now insist is their true face, is the party of law
and order. It is a posture which has allowed them to claim the voice of the
Russian people.
Mr Zhirinovsky also won because he leads a party united under his
unquestioned leadership, capable of projecting simple, clear messages
addressing popular concerns and playing up popular prejudice.
As he comes into his scruffy, pullulating offices, the word runs through the
crowd 'Shef idyot]' ('the leader's coming'). He strides in, erect and
vigorous, shaking the hands of the petitioners awaiting him. In his office,
lined with portraits of Russian generals and beneath a party slogan
proclaiming 'Freedom - LDP - Law', he talks to an old man with veteran's
ribbons brought in greet him, telling him to 'go and see my colleague; all
your problems will be dealt with, without delay, all, all'.
He is unfazed by his sudden power. He simply denies previous positions no
longer needed. 'How many times must I tell you? (beating the desk). We have
no claims on other countries] As for the Russians in the other former Soviet
states, they either stay where they are or come back. They are free to do as
they like.'
Along the hall is a queue of prospective party members to swell the claimed
membership figure of 176,000, already massive for a Russian party. One of
them, Mr Alexander Denisov (40), says he does not want to offend the
Americans but 'Kozyrev was giving them our country.' He was a photographer
but, he says, left his trade rather than be forced to take pornographic
pictures of women. On the way into the office, Mr Pavel Kuzovkin (28)
presides over a stall selling black T-shirts with skulls and demons on them,
and tapes by Madonna and Michael Jackson. He is a designer of nuclear plants
fallen into petty trading, but he 'likes Zhirinovsky because he let me set
up this stall. Yeltsin I don't like, he makes my life harder'.
Mr Zhirinovsky, having been carried to victory in the polls on a wave of
populist rhetoric, is now taking great pains to position himself as the
leader of Russia's political centre.
Occasionally he slips up. Yesterday, for example, after emphatically
insisting that he opposed all forms of racial, religious or ethnic
discrimination, Mr Zhirinovsky declared: 'It is true that now there is a
wave of anti-Semitism in the country, but we are not the ones who provoke
it, rather, it is being provoked by people of Jewish nationality.'
But when he remembers he is no longer on the campaign trail, he is the soul
of moderation. At home, he says he leads 'the party of compromise', which is
willing to work with President Boris Yeltsin, or, if the president prefers,
serve as 'a constructive opposition'. Abroad, the man who waxed poetic about
'Russian soldiers washing their boots in the Indian ocean' in an
autobiography published earlier this year now denies any expansionist aims.
'We are the party of peace, of co-operation, of culture,' Mr Zhirinovsky
assured the FT yesterday. 'We will never take a single step toward the west.
I will tell you ten times over, we are against the return to Russia of the
territories which belonged to the Soviet Union.'
Well aware that a large part of his party's appeal lies in the ambiguity of
its platform, he is reluctant to specify the policies he will advocate from
his new position of power. The most he will say is that the Liberal
Democrats will pursue four goals: an end to all economic subsidies to former
Soviet republics; the export of Russian armaments; the withdrawal of the
Russian army from all foreign territories; and the creation of 'civil
society' in Russia.
It is on economic policy, a 'no-win' issue if ever there was one, that Mr
Zhirinovsky most assiduously refuses to be pinned down. Apart from the
windfall he expects from arms exports - waving a metal flask a Russian
factory is producing instead of nuclear submarines to illustrate the folly
of defence industry conversion - he is reluctant to describe how he plans to
raise Russians' standard of living. Triumphantly attired in a tuxedo and
flanked by his shadow cabinet at a news conference yesterday, the most Mr
Zhirinovsky would say was that he favoured 'a mixed economy' with equal
rights for the state and private sectors.
He is more expansive when it comes to foreign policy. Apparently having
undergone an overnight metamorphosis from expansionist to isolationist, and
sublimely untroubled by previous pledges to extend Russian territory, he now
says he does not want 'a single metre' of territory beyond Russia's current
borders. Suddenly more liberal than Mr Yeltsin's own government, Mr
Zhirinovsky even says that he has no objections to eastern European
membership of Nato. 'It is up to them.'
This conciliatory stance is clearly intended to make collaboration with the
Liberal Democrats more palatable for Mr Yeltsin. Indeed, Mr Zhirinovsky, who
expects to meet the president soon, is confident that 'the president has a
positive feeling toward us, and toward me personally, because we have taken
a centrist position'.
If Mr Yeltsin chooses not to co-operate with this kinder, gentler
incarnation, that is not a problem either. Mr Zhirinovsky's eyes remain
firmly fixed on the ultimate prize in Russian politics, the presidency,
which has become a more powerful post now that the draft constitution has
been voted into law by Sunday's referendum. Mr Zhirinovsky, who says that he
will not insist that Mr Yeltsin stick to his earlier promise to hold
elections in 1994, is confident of winning whenever a vote is held.
'My only fear is that I might be the only strong candidate for the
presidency,' he says. 'I would not like the presidential marathon to be too
soft.'
Apart from a burning belief that it is his personal destiny to save Russia,
Mr Zhirinovsky's confidence is based on his realisation that he can
communicate a message which is compelling for millions of Russian voters.
This message, emblazoned on thousands of campaign posters, is his promise
'to raise Russia off its knees]'
Whether advocating isolationist or expansionist policies, Mr Zhirinovsky's
consistent promise is to ruthlessly put the interests of the people of
Russia above everything else. He is vague indeed when it comes to the ways
in which he will make Russians rich, but his is the boldest voice promising
to make Russians strong.

FT  15 DEC 93 / The Russian Elections: Major defends sovereignty of former
satellites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, KEVIN BROWN and Agencies
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major, the British prime minister, yesterday delivered a clear
warning that the west would resist any threats to the sovereignty of former
Soviet satellites.
'The UK and the international community have recognised the independence of
countries that were formerly part of the USSR. We expect their sovereignty
to be respected,' he said. He was echoing an alarm felt across Europe about
the implications for Russian foreign policy of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's
success in the elections.
In recent weeks the Liberal-Democratic party leader has repeatedly
questioned the sovereignty of some of the former Soviet territories, such as
the Baltic states and at times threatened Japan, Turkey, Finland, and
Germany with military aggression.
But although the British foreign minister, Mr Douglas Hurd, added his voice
to the chorus of concern, decribing the results as 'alarming', western
diplomats in general yesterday maintained their cautious stance. They
insisted that it was too early to assess the longer term implications of the
nationalist surge while it remains unclear what role Mr Zhirinovsky might
play in any future government.
Nevertheless, the success of his party seems set to add a nervous edge to
the Nato meeting next month, as well as fuelling western unease about
Russia's requests for an official role as 'peacekeeper' in the former Soviet
republics - a request that Mr Hurd and other western European governments
have hitherto given a cautiously warm hearing.
Ambassadors from Europe and the US at a meeting of the Western European
Union in Brussels yesterday denied there would be any policy change yet. 'We
do not see a need to change our policy, neither Nato nor the WEU,' Mr Willem
van Eekelen, WEU secretary general, said after the meeting.
But in a comment which marks a shift of tone from recent western statements,
Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary general, warned that the alliance should
remain vigilant towards Russia and maintain a military balance.
However, he insisted that the alliance had no need to change policy towards
Moscow after Sunday's vote.

FT  15 DEC 93 / The Russian Elections: Ukraine tightens grip on its N-arms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The nationalist victory at the Russian polls has left Ukraine's 52m citizens
nervous about the future of their newly independent state, and could further
stall Ukraine's stated intention of becoming a non-nuclear power.
For many leaders and politicians, Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's strong showing
is a concrete sign that Russia poses a real territorial threat.
'Our feelings have been justified,' Mr Dmytro Pavlychko, head of the
parliament's foreign relations committee, told Ukraine's most popular
newspaper. 'I think it should now be clear to many in the west why we have
taken such a position on disarmament.'
In the face of strong international pressure Ukraine is standing firm on its
demands for security guarantees and fair financial compensation for the
2,760 short-range nuclear warheads it transferred to Russia last year and
for its 1,656 remaining warheads.
Kazakhstan's ratification on Monday of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
(NPT) has left Ukraine as the last of the former Soviet states outside
Russia to renounce its nuclear status.
Though President Leonid Kravchuk has promised to resubmit the Start-1 and
NPT treaties to the new parliament after elections in March, the new rise of
Russia's radical right goes to the heart of why Ukraine is reluctant to send
its 176 strategic missiles to its unstable neighbour without achieving
western security guarantees in return.
'It is reason to hold on to the weapons in parliament and will push us to a
more anti-Russian position,' said Aleksandr Charodeyev, a pro-Russian
parliamentarian from the eastern coal mining region of Donetsk.
'Zhirinovsky's victory only strengthens nationalism within Ukraine. There is
a great danger that there could be two nuclear powers with nationalist
tendencies pitted against each other. This is a deathly, dangerous threat on
a planetary scale.'
Ukraine's military experts acknowledge that their missiles are long-range,
designed to hit targets half way around the globe and cannot be aimed at
near-by Moscow. Also, Ukraine has no operational control - Russia still
controls the 'red button' and targeting codes. Many Ukrainians nevertheless
perceive that their missiles somehow protect their borders against invasion.
Mr Kravchuk himself has so far adopted a 'wait and see' attitude on the
Russian election, but he did say yesterday: 'I can't agree with the
indivisible Russia extending to its February 1917 borders. If this turns out
to be the official state policy of Russia, then we will come out with a
reaction.'

FT  15 DEC 93 / EU and US clear last hurdles to trade deal: Negotiators set
aside differences on financial and audiovisual services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL and FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The last obstacles to successful completion of the Uruguay Round global
trade pact were effectively cleared in Geneva yesterday when the US and the
European Union agreed to disagree over long-standing differences.
While there was disappointment that the two world trade leaders failed to
settle differences over financial and audiovisual services and shipping and
aircraft subsidies, there was relief that weeks of brinkmanship were over,
and the Uruguay Round deal was in sight.
Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, welcomed the breakthrough, which came after all-night
negotiations. 'I am confident that we can conclude the round on Wednesday,'
he said.
President Bill Clinton declared that the US was on 'the verge of an historic
victory' in its efforts to open markets. He acknowledged that 'thorny
details' remained to be settled, but said he had instructed US negotiators
to push hard to get them out of the way.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, said the US and the EU had
'broken the Gordian knot'. The deal would bring tariff barriers down more
than any other agreement in history, expand US exports and apply
international trade rules for the first time to services, agriculture,
intellectual property and investment. Mr Kantor claimed the global economy
'will be Dollars 6,000bn (Pounds 4,000bn) wealthier' over the next decade
because of the deal.
In the market-opening deal agreed between the US and the EU, each will cut
tariffs on the other's products by just over 50 per cent. Such cuts are
commonplace in market-opening deals with other countries, and compare with a
target of 33 per cent set by negotiators in 1988.
Sir Leon Brittan, the EU trade commissioner, shared Mr Kantor's regrets that
differences over audiovisual services, shipping and financial services had
not been resolved. He also cautioned that the deal finalised yesterday was
between the US and the EU, with the other 111 Uruguay Round participants
still to be brought on board before this evening.
EU foreign ministers will today consider whether to give their seal of
approval to the draft Uruguay Round accord.
Mr Sutherland said problems remained in the sensitive areas of financial
services, textiles and intellectual property, but did not expect these to
block completion of the round.
However, the failure of the US to win better access to Europe's film and
television market was bitterly felt yesterday by US film industry lobbyists
in Geneva. Mr Jack Valenti, who heads the Motion Picture Association of
America, described the outcome as a loss for the people of Europe, who would
have less choice on programming in future.
News that the EU had succeeded in removing the culturally sensitive film and
broadcasting industry from the Gatt draft was seen as a significant boost in
Brussels. 'It is a total victory for France,' said one official, referring
to that country's fierce battle to defend European culture.
France also succeeded in reopening the Blair House agreement on subsidised
EU farm exports, and in defending its aluminium industry against threats of
lower tariff protection.
By refusing to accept any audiovisual deal, the US hinted yesterday that its
options were open to press legal challenges to Europe's broadcast regime,
but EU negotiators were sceptical about this prospect.
Complex compromises have been proposed for financial services and shipping,
which effectively buy time for both sides to negotiate settlements over the
next two years.
One conspicuous success from the negotiations was US support for creation of
a Multilateral Trade Organisation to replace the Gatt, with wider powers.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Britain and Ireland agree Ulster peace accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An Anglo-Irish declaration aimed at ending 25 years of IRA violence and
paving the way for a permanent political settlement in Northern Ireland will
be unveiled in London today by Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds.
After a day of non-stop telephone diplomacy between the British and Irish
prime ministers, Whitehall officials said the statement would be released
after a Downing Street meeting between the two leaders this morning.
With only a few minor differences remaining to be settled, Mr Major expects
to spell out the accord in the House of Commons a few hours later. He was
last night also considering the possibility of a prime ministerial broadcast
to outline the details to the people of Northern Ireland.
The declaration, designed to reconcile the competing interests of the
province's unionist majority with the aspirations of Irish nationalists will
be hailed by both leaders as the best chance since 1968 for an end to
terrorism.
Mr Reynolds and the Irish foreign minister, Mr Dick Spring, briefed a
specially convened cabinet meeting late last night on the joint declaration.
The cabinet fully endorsed the document in its final draft form.
The Whitehall officials said that the document would underline the
'irrelevance' of the military campaign being waged by the IRA to secure a
united Ireland. British intelligence reports suggest the leaders of the IRA
and Sinn Fein, its political wing, are already embroiled in a fierce
argument over whether to end the campaign.
The statement will also provide the springboard for the relaunch of talks
among the constitutional parties aimed at restoring devolved government to
Northern Ireland.
But even as Mr Major and Mr Reynolds were clearing the remaining obstacles,
some leading unionist politicians were questioning if the declaration would
bring lasting peace.
The statement will include a firm guarantee to the Protestant majority in
the province that its status as part of the UK could only be changed with
their consent. It will also signal Mr Reynolds' willingness to drop the
Republic's constitutional claim to the north in the event of a permanent
political settlement.
But in return Mr Major has agreed to language in the declaration which goes
further than hitherto in acknowledging the aspirations of those seeking a
united Ireland. He has accepted wording affirming the right of
'self-determination' for 'the people of Ireland, north and south'.
The statement will also underline that the British government has no
'selfish or strategic interest' in keeping Northern Ireland within the UK if
a majority of its people were to vote for unity with the Republic.
Despite the strong affirmation of the veto on any constitutional change
wielded by the majority, such phrases could provoke an angry reaction among
unionists.
Mr Reynolds, who has said he would not accept any declaration which did not
offer a reasonable prospect of an end to the IRA campaign, also appears to
have won agreement on the establishment of a new Irish convention.
Mr Major will stress that the convention, designed to provide an early
opportunity for Sinn Fein to join talks, will not have any real authority.
He appears to have succeeded in removing from the communique a call for
parallel referendums in the north and south.
But the precise phrases in this section of the communique will be critical
in determining the impact of the declaration.
If they move too far in the direction of Sinn Fein, they will threaten a
unionist backlash against Mr Major's government and its fragile majority at
Westminster. That in turn could trigger a renewed escalation in the
terrorist campaign being waged by Protestant paramilitaries.
Officials acknowledged last night that the two leaders were uncertain if the
statement would persuade the IRA to abandon its military campaign. One
British minister said it might mark the 'beginning, not the end' of the
search for peace.
An important figure in the moderate Ulster Unionist party, whose support
will be essential, was less sanguine. He predicted the declaration would be
a 'mish-mash with one bit of it contradicting the other'.
Mr Spring was optimistic about the prospects for peace. He said: 'I believe
peace is possible in a very short period of time . . . the intention (of the
joint declaration) is to lead to a cessation of violence and with that our
hopes go.'

FT  15 DEC 93 / Reformists pin hopes on Yeltsin's support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Leaders of Russia's shaken pro-reform camp yesterday began consultations on
a new government following the weekend's elections but said the survival of
market reforms would depend mainly on President Boris Yeltsin's will to push
them forward.
The most popular reform party, Russia's Choice, became more confident that,
in coalition with the three other main reformist parties, it could command
more seats than the combined anti-reform forces of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's
neo-fascist Liberal Democratic party, Communists, and Agrarians.
But both Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the Yabloko bloc, the second
largest reformist party, and Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister and a
founder of Russia's Choice, said it was up to the Russian president to throw
sweeping new powers granted him by the constitution behind reform.
'The president must . . . clarify what policy he wants,' said Mr Yavlinsky.
Mr Fyodorov added: 'I'm sure he won't compromise (over reform) but he has
yet to speak openly.'
The main pro-reform parties have precluded co-operation with Mr Zhirinovsky.
'It is clear that nobody wants to have anything to do with this maverick and
moron,' said Mr Fyodorov. First results yesterday for the parliamentary
seats filled on a first-past-the-post basis suggest reformists may perform
more strongly in those than in earlier results for seats determined by
proportional representation.
Preliminary results for the seats decided by proportional representation
gave Mr Zhirinovsky 24 per cent, followed by Russia's Choice with 15 per
cent, the Communists with 11 per cent, and others, including Yabloko, with
about 7 per cent.
Mr Zhirinovsky, whose ultimate goal is the presidency, said he would join a
coalition government only if his party could occupy the foreign, defence,
security and interior ministries.
However, trying to project a more moderate image than his ultra-nationalist
and expansionist platform, he promised not to 'destabilise' the situation if
he was left out of the government, indicating that he would use parliament
to increase his popularity.
Mr Yeltsin, who has said he would use his new powers to pursue democracy and
reforms, has made no comment about Mr Zhirinovsky's electoral success.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Business community happy to see Sinn Fein at negotiating
table
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ninety-five per cent of Ulster's business community would be content to see
Sinn Fein at the negotiating table as part of the search for peace if the
IRA were to abandon violence for a substantial period, according to a
Financial Times poll, write Tim Coone and Jimmy Burns.
Only a handful of companies share the view of the Rev Ian Paisley of the
Democratic Unionist party, who argues Sinn Fein should indefinitely be
excluded from the political process.
Ulster executives also back the politically controversial proposal which has
been at the heart of Dublin's peace plan to test any political settlement
through separate referendums in both parts of Ireland.
The survey - the first of its kind - will hearten the London and Dublin
governments as it shows that senior executives firmly back their efforts to
achieve peace. But the executives do not believe that either the IRA or
Loyalist paramilitaries can be defeated militarily.
Financial Times reporters sought the views of 80 chief executives of
Northern Ireland's leading businesses last week. Fifty-six responded and
they were divided about the prospects of a settlement, with optimists
roughly matching pessimists.
More than 60 per cent were prepared for the British government to concede
enhanced north-south structures for economic co-operation to achieve a
settlement.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Cable groups'telecoms link will rival BT and Mercury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The backbone of a national telecommunications network to rival those of BT
and Mercury in the UK will be in place by mid-1995, following a move by
cable television and telephone companies to create six regional networks.
The networks will cover London, the Midlands, the north, East Anglia, the
south coast and Scotland, bringing together the combined telephone and
television operations being set up in 62 urban areas by 20 cable companies.
Fibre-optic and microwave links will permit the companies, mostly US owned,
to engage in joint programming and send regional telecom traffic across each
other's networks without having to use BT or Mercury.
Payments to BT and Mercury are the largest telecommunications outgoing of
the cable companies. They want to cut their interconnection requirements to
a minimum. Cable telephone subscriber numbers have grown from 109,000 to
300,000 this year, and are rising by about 20,000 a month.
A regional network covering the London area will be the first launched,
early next year. It will connect the networks of six operators within the
M25 area.
Mr John Sheridan, chief executive of Encom, a subsidiary of Bell Canada
Enterprises which is building networks in east London, said 'very
considerable' savings would result.
The Midlands region will be the second to become operational, linking
Birmingham Cable's network, the country's largest, with that of Southwestern
Bell in the Black Country.
A northern regional network, linking the networks of Yorkshire Cable,
Southwestern Bell in Liverpool and Nynex in Manchester, is likely to be
operational within a year, with the other three regions following
afterwards.
Mr Richard Woollam, director of the Cable Television Association, said: 'I
think all six will connect up, though it may not be the cable companies that
do it.' An option, he said, was to use microwave links or leased lines from
existing operators and new entrants to cover long distances between regions.
Birmingham Cable already has a microwave data link with south London, leased
from National Transcommunications, the former transmitting and engineering
arm of the old Independent Broadcasting Authority.
No regulatory hurdles prevent the cable companies from linking their
networks.
Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, said granting the necessary
licences would be a 'formality'.
The cable companies are reluctant to talk openly about trans-regional links
for fear of souring relations with Mercury, which carries most of their
long-distance traffic. However, they have already taken steps to cut
interconnection payments.

FT  15 DEC 93 / UK and Ireland near Ulster peace accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An Anglo-Irish declaration aimed at ending 25 years of IRA violence and
paving the way for a permanent political settlement in Northern Ireland will
be finalised in London before the end of this week.
After a day of non-stop telephone diplomacy between the Mr John Major and Mr
Albert Reynolds, Whitehall officials said the statement would be released
after a meeting of the two prime ministers later today.
Mr Major expects to spell out the accord to MPs before parliament breaks for
Christmas recess on Friday. Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said
last night Dublin and London were now 'very close to agreement'.
But even as the British and Irish prime ministers were clearing the
remaining obstacles, some politicians in the province were questioning if it
would bring lasting peace.
The declaration, designed to reconcile the competing interests of the
province's unionist majority with the Irish nationalist aspirations will be
hailed by both leaders as the best chance since 1968 for an end to
terrorism.
Its release will follow weeks of intense and often acrimonious negotiations
between Mr Major and Mr Reynolds, culminating yesterday in a frantic series
of telephone conversations between the two men and their officials.
Downing Street officials said the two prime ministers had resolved the main
differences over the declaration, but further negotiations would be needed
during their meeting to clear up some less important issues.
The statement will include a firm guarantee to the protestant majority in
the province its status as part of the UK could only be changed with their
consent.
It will also signal Mr Reynolds' willingness to drop the Republic's
constitutional claim to the North in the event of a permanent political
settlement.
But in return Mr Major is thought to have agreed to language in the
declaration which goes further than hitherto in acknowledging the
aspirations of those seeking a united Ireland.
Mr Reynolds, who has said he would not accept any declaration which did not
offer a reasonable prospect of an end to the IRA campaign, has been pressing
the unionist veto to be coupled with a broader commitment to Irish
self-determination. He also wants an all-Ireland convention to provide an
early opportunity for Sinn Fein to join talks.
The precise phrases in that section of the communique - will be critical in
determining the impact of the declaration.
If they move too far in the direction of Sinn Fein, they will threaten a
unionist backlash against Mr Major's government and its fragile majority at
Westminster. That in turn could trigger a renewed escalation in the
terrorist campaign being waged by protestant paramilitaries.
Officials acknowledged last night that the two leaders were uncertain if it
would persuade the IRA to abandon its military campaign. One British
minister said it might mark the 'beginning not the end' of the search for
peace.

FT  15 DEC 93 / Russian reformists pin their hopes on Yeltsin's support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The survival of economic reforms in Russia depends on President Boris
Yeltsin's will to push them forward, leaders of Russia's divided and shaken
pro-reform camp said yesterday.
The most popular reform party Russia's Choice become more confident that, in
coalition with the three other main reformist parties, it could command more
seats than the combined anti-reform forces of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's
neo-fascist Liberal Democratic party, Communists, and Agrarians.
The earliest results were for parliamentary seats being selected by
proportional representation from party lists. First results yesterday for
seats filled on a first-past-the-post basis suggest that reformists may have
benefited by being unaffiliated. Reformists seem to be winning such seats
because many are former officials whose names were recognised by voters.
The latest results for the seats being drawn from party lists which are
being determined by proportional representation, gave Mr Zhirinovsky 24 per
cent, followed by Russia's Choice with 15 per cent, the Communists with 11
per cent, and others, including Mr Yavlinsky's Yabloko bloc, about around 7
per cent.
Although serious bargaining on forming a new government was delayed as
participants waited for proper 'working results' before committing
themselves, the main parties spelt out their conditions for joining the
government.
Mr Zhirinovsky, whose ultimate goal is the presidency, said he would join a
coalition government only if his party could occupy the foreign ministry,
defence, security and interior ministries.
Yesterday he adopted a more moderate tone compared with his on-the-stump
comments, in an effort to soothe critics fearful of his ultra-right and
expansionist platform.
He promised not to'destabilise' the situation if he was left out of the
government, indicating that he would use parliament to increase his
popularity.
However, all the main pro-reform parties have excluded any co-operation with
Mr Zhirinovsky.
Mr Yeltsin, who has said he would use his new powers to pursue democracy and
reforms, has made no comment about Mr Zhirinovsky's electoral success.
Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the second largest reformist party after
Russia's Choice, said the reformers' success would depend entirely on how
President Yeltsin used the sweeping and permanent powers granted to him by
Russia's newly approved constitution.
Mr Yavlinsky said any new cabinet would have to be homogeneous and not like
the present government in which 'one third is building communism, one third
is building capitalism, and a third are looking after their personal
affairs.' He said it was also essential to give up attempts to dash to
financial stabilisation overnight because the fight against inflation would
only lead to 'bloody clashes'.
He said the electoral victory of Mr Zhirinovsky's 'national-socialist' party
of was in large part a reaction against reforms which had been harsh and
incoherent.

FT  14 DEC 93 / International Company News: London Electricity lifts interim
payout by 32% to 7.4p a share

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
London Electricity yesterday announced an increase in its interim dividend,
which at 32 per cent was well ahead of any of the other UK regional
electricity companies.
London's increase reflects the adoption of a policy which makes it the first
regional power company to state an aim to pay a third of the total dividend
at the halfway stage. Other electricity distributors tend to aim for 30 per
cent.
Analysts increased their dividend forecasts for the full year marginally to
about 22.2p. The shares rose initially but closed the day unchanged at 644p.
In the six months to September 30, London made pre-tax profits of Pounds
69.9m (Dollars 104.5m), against Pounds 52m, restated to take in the effects
of the new coal contracts. Turnover on continuing operations was down from
Pounds 584.3m to Pounds 581.6m.
Earnings per share rose to 24p from 17.7p and the dividend to 7.4p from
5.6p.

FT  14 DEC 93 / International Company News: Bombardier sees loss on Channel
project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CALAIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bombardier, the diversified Canadian transport group which is making the
Channel tunnel shuttle, expects to make a loss on its contract to supply
railcars, but hopes that the technical prestige of the contract will bring
future compensation and orders.
Mr Michel Lord, a vice-president of Bombardier, said that his company would
not have signed its CDollars 820m (USDollars 621.2m) contract in 1989 to
supply 254 railcars if it had known there was going to be an eventual
CDollars 450m cost over-run.
Bombardier said the over-run was almost entirely due to design changes
imposed on contractors by French and British government safety inspectors,
such as a 10cm widening of some doors, and demanded compensation.
In a deal reached earlier this month with Eurotunnel, the operator of the
undersea rail link, Bombardier settled for CDollars 157m in cash and up to
25m shares in Eurotunnel, which at their current valuation would bring the
compensation up to CDollars 375m.
'A speedy out-of-court settlement for less is far better than spending 10
years in court for more,' Mr Lord said. Bombardier, which in accepting the
shares has become Eurotunnel's largest single shareholder, hopes that in
other contracts it would be able to recoup losses it had made on the Channel
tunnel project and find a use for the technical lessons it had learnt.
'The Eurotunnel railcars are the most sophisticated product we have ever
made in this line,' said Mr Ward, because of their size - some are
double-decked to take cars - and because of the security equipment required
in the 50km tunnel.
Speaking at the French end of the tunnel which has now been handed over by
Trans Manche Link, the construction consortium, to Eurotunnel, the latter's
director-general, Mr Andre Bertrand, indicated yesterday it would still be
some time before Eurotunnel presented its final bill.

Saft, the battery manufacturer which is a subsidiary of Alcatel-Alsthom, the
European telecommunications, energy and transport group, has agreed to buy
the aerospace battery activities of two US groups, Gates Corporation and
Johnson Controls, writes John Ridding.
Gates' aerospace batteries division manufactures nickel-cadmium and nickel
hydrogen products and employs 130. Johnson Controls, based in Wisconsin, is
a specialist in lightweight, high-powered batteries suitable for use in
communications satellites.
Saft, which already has production centres in the US, has annual sales of
about Dollars 600m. Its space division recorded sales of Dollars 10m last
year, more than half of which came from satellite applications. The company
said the planned acquisitions would make it one of the world's largest
satellite battery manufacturers with annual sales of about Dollars 17.5m
from this activity.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Ruhr plans a challenge for Disney
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mickey Mouse may be in trouble in the cultural fortress of France, but Bugs
Bunny isn't bothered - he is planning to hit the ground running in
neighbouring Germany, in the unlikely surroundings of the industrial Ruhr
region.
Warner Brothers, the US entertainment arm of the Time-Warner media empire,
and the Nixdorf family, who made their money from Germany's leading computer
company, yesterday announced plans to open a DM350m (Pounds 138m) 'film
leisure park' and studio complex at Bottrop, once the heart of a thriving
coal mining industry.
Now Bugs Bunny, Batman, and the Gremlins, not to mention the stars of
Germany's biggest international war film spectacular, The Boat, will seek to
bring some good cheer - and jobs - back to the depressed industrial area.
The leisure park will be on a smaller scale than the troubled Euro Disney
theme park outside Paris, but it still amounts to the biggest film industry
investment ever undertaken in Germany, according to the delighted state
government of North Rhine-Westphalia.
The idea is to combine both a leisure park, with roundabouts, shows and a
funfair, with a studio complex for both film and television productions, on
the lines of Warner Brothers' Movie World complex in Australia.
The venture is intended to provide 900 jobs in a region badly hit by the
collapse of coal mining. Unemployment at Bottrop alone is some 12.3 per
cent.
Mr Kurt Schmitz, mayor of the town, greeted yesterday's announcement of
'provisional agreement' on the investment with enthusiasm.
The decision amounted to 'one of the greatest financial commitments ever
undertaken by an individual investor in Bottrop,' he declared. 'For the town
of Bottrop, the Warner Brothers decision is particularly happy, because it
means that the efforts of the community to carry on the process of economic,
structural change have been given a new impetus.' It was all a matter, he
said, of transforming an economy dependent on the primary industry of
mining, into a blooming landscape of the tertiary sector - the leisure
industry.
The North Rhine-Westphalia state government, battered by rounds of
redundancies in the traditional coal mining and steel industries, has
promised big subsidies to promote the project. Money will come from the
state's mining industry development programme, according to Mr Gunther
Einert, economics minister.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'If the whole country's voted like our town, the result will be a disaster,'
said Mr Alexander Kulakov gloomily.
It was 3am yesterday and Mr Kulakov, deputy mayor of Serpukhov, about 100km
south-east of Moscow, was surveying the growing piles of ballot papers. His
fellow citizens, it was by now clear, had voted in large numbers for the
Liberal Democrat party of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, variously described as
extreme nationalist or neo-fascist, and had put the Communist party in
second place.
In the referendum on President Boris Yeltsin's proposed constitution the Yes
and No votes were neck and neck.
Mr Kulakov, immaculate in brown tie, yellow shirt and brown but non-matching
jacket and trousers, said he had been a German teacher for 23 years before
taking to municipal politics. Although not a member of any party, he
proclaimed himself a supporter of Russia's Choice, the party backing Mr
Yeltsin and advocating faster economic reform. At Serpukhov town hall, that
seemed a lonely thing to be.
Serpukhov is in the heart of the belt of territory encircling Moscow that
until last year was out of bounds to foreign visitors because many military
bases and industries are sited there. Many inhabitants see themselves as
having little to gain and much to lose from rapid political and economic
change; and they had used the freedom of a new political system -
multi-party democracy - to make that clear. Yet the scrupulous fairness with
which local officialdom had embraced that system was undeniable. Mr Kulakov
also stood out in the town hall by being one of the very few males in sight.
Presiding over the proceedings was the secretary of the municipality, Mrs
Zinaida Yakimenka, who gravely accepted the 'protocols' or returns brought
in by the officials - also women - from polling stations.
One of the last sets to arrive came from the nearby Palace of Culture,
carried proudly in procession across the square by Galia Shornikova, the
secretary, and Tatiana Suyarkova, the president of that polling station,
followed by colleagues carring the actual ballot papers in sealed packages.
Why was this work seemingly a female monopoly? 'Because men won't work for
these wages,' was the good-humoured reply. All involved in the count were
employees of a single 'construction' company, but became rather coy when
asked what exactly it constructed. Mrs Shornikova gave her profession as
'quality engineer', Mrs Suyarkova as 'head of department'.
Russians had voted in the referendum and in four different elections, only
one of them (for half the seats in the state Duma or lower house of
parliament) clearly pitting rival parties against each other. In the other
three - for the regional assembly, the upper house or 'federation council'
and for the half of the Duma elected in single-member constituencies - few
candidates were identified with parties on the ballot paper.
Candidates who did best in Serpukhov were people who had lived and worked in
the area. Most of them either had no party affiliation known to those who
were counting the votes, or were associated with quite different parties
from the ones that did well in the vote for party lists.
One could perhaps qualify Mr Kulakov's remark: if all of Russia voted like
Serpukhov, the new parliament may be a disaster, but not because it is
clearly dominated by one or two parties. On the contrary, it will contain
many people with no clear party affiliation, but mandated to defend local
interests. That should be a body wide open to presidential influence, if the
president knows how to use it.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Survey of Charities Investment and Finance (7): The
Salvation Army
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
More than a century after the Salvation Army began its work among the
homeless and destitute, the need for its services remains strong. The army
adopted Strategy for Change, a reappraisal of its services for London's
homeless, two years ago; its recommendations are currently being
implemented. These involve a Pounds 35m upgrading of all the army's existing
facilities for the homeless in the capital.
Breaking the cycle of homelessness is central to the new approach.
Self-containing flats will be provided to enable hostel residents to move
into long-term accommodation, while Salvation Army social workers and
volunteers have been trained in outreach work to make contact with homeless
people on the streets.
The success of such work depends on a regular flow of income from charitable
appeals, and this year has been a fraught one for the Salvation Army. It
announced in the spring that it had lost about Pounds 6m 'through the
fraudulent activities of third parties.' Police investigations, legal action
to recover money, and inquiries by the Charity Commissioners are all
continuing.
The events have not yet had a serious impact on the Salvation Army's
fundraising - perhaps because its strong social service record is so
established in the public mind - but such incidents send shudders through
the voluntary sector. Although charity managers point out that even banks
sometimes fall victim to fraud, they recognise that a single problem is
likely to enhance the perception among some sections of the public that
charities are run by amateurs.
For this and other reasons large charities are giving increasing priority to
ensuring that they have professional management structures.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Survey of Charities Investment and Finance (8): Independent
advice needed - Investment management strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT ALLDIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Trustees with substantial sums to invest should consider appointing an
independent investment manager to them in drawing up their investment
policy.'
This statement, taken from a Charity Commission pamphlet*, shows that the
Commission is now actively encouraging charities to seek investment advice.
Hymans Robertson, the consulting actuaries, estimates that at the end of
December 1992, Pounds 13.047bn was under the management of the 25 leading
investment firms offering charitable fund investments. Of that, Pounds
10.874bn is divided into 1,144 segregated accounts.
These sums are still small compared to the total funds managed in the
pensions industry. But charities are making increasing use of the number and
range of managed funds available. Two things show why:
First, the Official Custodian estimates that divestment back to the
charities' trustees will take about five years (starting in January 1993).
Trustees are now responsible - and liable - for the performance of their
investments on behalf of the charity.
But many trustees and charity managers have neither the time (nor the
knowledge) actively to manage their investment portfolios day-to-day: 'All
we want is an investment expert who we can trust so we don't have to worry
every day whether a particular stock has gone up or down,' says Ian
Theodoreson, finance director of the Save the Children Fund.
Second, the need for a better investment return. Charities depend very much
on contributions and fundraising (the top five by total voluntary income
alone pooled more than Pounds 292m in 1992). But they are also big spenders
(those same five charities spent Pounds 385.7m in the same year).
The shortfall has to be made up by sales of goods and services, government
grants, rent and investment. But with the government trying to reduce its
expenditure and income from goods and services and struggling in the
recession, charities have become increasingly dependent on their investment
returns.
Most of the big fund managing firms offer two main investment alternatives
Segregated managed funds. These can start at any funding level, with minimum
sizes of zero to Pounds 15m. Management fees, however, tend to be weighted
against the smaller fund levels. For example, Fleming Investment Management
fees start at 0.8 per cent for the first Pounds 5m, 0.4 per cent for the
next Pounds 6m, 0.3 per cent for the next Pounds 25m and 0.2 per cent
thereafter. Mr Paul Drake, head of the charity team at Baring Global Fund
Managers, says it manages segregated funds for charities with funds in
excess of Pounds 10m. 'It is ludicrous for small and medium sized charities
with less than Pounds 10m in segregated funds, to pay these fee levels.'
Fee levels - not always comparable in terms of services offered - range
widely. According to Hymans Robertson's survey, annual charges for managing
a Pounds 5m fund ranged between Pounds 35,000 (top quartile) down to Pounds
20,000 (bottom quartile. For charities with Pounds 25m to invest,
comparative figures ranged between Pounds 100,000 and Pounds 50,000.
Common Investment Funds (CIF). CIFs are small in terms of the total amount
invested relative to segregated funds, but they have grown in number and
range since the divestment from the Official Custodian. The Charity
Commission allows two investment alternatives - equities or fixed interest
securities. From this, most fund managers are now offering three CIF
investment products: UK equity, fixed income and overseas investments.
However, the Commission (stating its objectives for investing charitable
funds) presents fund managers with the dilemma of how to protect the fund's
capital while at the same time 'obtaining the best income from those
funds.'*
As a rule, most fund managers tend to view equity-based portfolios as
offering the best investment. 'We have an important educational role to play
in steering charities away from concentration of investment in monetary
assets towards an equity biased strategy,' says Mr Drake at Baring.
Mr Jonathan Maylin-Smith, fund manager at the Church, Charity and Local
Authority Fund Managers (CCLA) says: 'Charities should stick with an
equity-based investment policy.'
Overseas CIFs are becoming increasingly popular, but fund managers are not
unanimous about their benefits. Flemings hopes to launch its overseas fund
by the end of January 1994. Baring already has Pounds 7m-Pounds 8m in an
overseas equity fund. Murray Johnstone Asset Management offers funds that
have exposure to UK, US, Japan and South East Asian equities, fixed interest
and smaller companies. Global equity and overseas equity vehicles are also
available.
Some fund managers are not convinced that so many products are warranted:
'Charities need income and overseas investment tend to offer lower income.
And for most UK charities, distributing in the UK, it is difficult to
contemplate an investment abroad,' says one.
However, the spread of CIFs is unlikely to diminish. Baring, for instance,
is now looking into the viability of a small UK companies fund, on the basis
that the sector has the best prospects to benefit from an upturn in the UK
economy. Ethical-based CIFs have also been mooted, but fund managers
question if their returns will be adequate: 'The legal position is quite
clear. The trustee's primary responsibility is to maximise the return to the
fund,' says Mr Maylin-Smith.
But the range of UK equity-based investment alternatives has not been helped
by changes in domestic tax law. In the last UK March Budget, the chancellor
announced that advanced corporation tax (ACT) is to be reduced from 25 per
cent to 20 per cent on dividends in two stages by April 5, 1994. As
charities receive a tax credit on top of their net dividend income which
they use to reclaim the ACT paid on their behalf, any reduction in the rate
of ACT will result in a fall in their gross dividend return. Charities
therefore stand to lose 5 per cent in dividend over the period.
But of those fund managers questioned, most were not too concerned:
'Charities should not change their investment policy because of the changes
in ACT. Equities have performed so well as the interest-rate cycle has
turned down,' says the CCLA's Mr Maylin-Smith (significantly raised
dividends and enhanced scrip alternatives have also helped).
But at time when the Government is turning to charities to take up the slack
from the welfare state, and when charity income is at a premium, says Mr
Drake, 'we have to acknowledge it is a negative.'

FT  14 DEC 93 / Survey of Charities Investment and Finance (9): Christmas
spirit never stops - Alan Pike previews the festive season - 1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Throughout December, the offices of the Charities Advisory Trust have
bustled with the spirit of the Christmas after next.
The trust is one of the main promoters of charity Christmas cards and Hilary
Blum, its director, is already deeply involved in thinking about designs
that will go on sale for Christmas 1994.
Set up in 1979, the trust was established to advise charities on their
trading activities. During the 1980s a growing number moved into various
forms of trading, but the business skills for selling and marketing success
do not automatically exist on the staff of charities.
Christmas cards were the trust's first venture. Ms Blum's aim has been to
improve the service, quality and income that charities receive from card
operations, and she has consciously driven the trust's range to the top end
of the market to improve margins.
The trust's Card Aid outlets now sell tens of millions of cards a year,
although Ms Blum says that smaller charities able to sell at least 500 packs
can sensibly have their own cards.
The trust's most recent venture has been its Museum Stores in London, which
sell reproductions of items in museums and art galleries around the world.
The first store opened in 1988; two more have been launched this year.
Ms Blum's staff have also helped real museum shops. Birmingham City Museums
and Art Galleries asked the trust to revive the fortunes of its retail
outlets, which were losing Pounds 100,000 a year - now returned to
profitability.
The trust operates on basic business principles of avoiding waste. 'That
even applies when I am away from London on business,' says Ms Blum. 'I don't
just walk around the local art galleries for pleasure - I'm always looking
out for new ideas for Christmas cards and the Museum Stores.'

FT  14 DEC 93 / Survey of Charities Investment and Finance (6): Scots are
squeezed - A golden jubilee north of the border
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations is celebrating 50 years of
activity co-ordinating and supporting the work of charities north of the
border.
'Fifty years on, many issues remain remarkably unchanged,' comments Mr
Martin Sime, the council's director, in its golden jubilee report. Many
items on the list of issues that half a century has failed to change are
summed up by Mr Sime in the words 'inadequate funding.'
Scottish charities, like those elsewhere in the UK, have recently been
affected by the impact of the recession on individual and corporate
donations and the continuing squeeze on public spending. But there are
factors that place particular financial pressures on the Scottish voluntary
sector.
While some household name organisations like Barnardos and National
Children's Home operate on both sides of the border, many other large
charities do not.
Most of Scotland's charities are purely Scottish based. This almost
invariably makes them smaller than their English counterparts - and size is
an important component of success in modern charity fundraising.
Charities Aid Foundation figures show that, while the top 200 fundraising
charities increased their income last year, smaller ones suffered a drop.
Only a handful of specifically Scottish charities are in the top 200.
The problem for the Scottish voluntary sector of charitable fundraising
being dominated by big names is compounded by the fact that, although many
of the largest charities do not provide services outside England and Wales,
their advertising campaigns still attract funds from Scottish donors. There
have even been examples of Scottish financial institutions entering
sponsorship deals with charities that do not operate in Scotland.
Scottish voluntary sector leaders believe that it is insufficiently
appreciated that many 'national' charities do not cover the whole UK, and
that this also affects the level of support Scotland receives from
London-based corporate head offices and grant-making trusts. Less than 5 per
cent of grant money from trusts goes to Scottish causes.
The 1992 Charities Act does not apply in Scotland, where the sector is less
rigidly regulated, and the powers of the Charity Commissioners do not extend
there. There is anxiety that this may be about to lead to dubious
fundraisers turning their attentions on Scotland.
'We are particularly worried about the abuse of telephone fundraising, which
the act has tightened up in England and Wales,' said Mr Sime. 'There will be
an enormous temptation for unscrupulous fundraisers operating in England to
simply dial Scottish numbers instead.'
While there are doubts among managers of Scottish charities about the
appropriateness of importing the Charity Commission model from England,
worries about the adequacy of Scottish charity law has prompted an SCVO
campaign for a better regulatory framework.
Voluntary organisations provide a third of all training for the unemployed
in Scotland, while 840 local voluntary sector projects are funded through
the government's Urban Programme. This makes public funds particularly
important to the sector.
Although the Scottish Urban Programme is not being run down - as in England
and Wales - there are fears that money from its Pounds 80m annual budget
will in future be diverted from supporting local anti-poverty and economic
development projects to housing and other purely physical redevelopment
activities. Without the strong social dimension that voluntary organisations
can provide, argues the sector, physical regeneration cannot achieve its
full potential.
Voluntary sector leaders are also concerned about the likely impact of local
government reorganisation in Scotland, with the proposed abolition of the
big regional councils. They seek transitional financial protection for
regional voluntary organisations likely to face loss of funds and closure.
Scottish voluntary sector leaders share many common concerns with their
colleagues elsewhere in the UK. These include worries about the extent to
which the national lottery might undermine donations to established
charities.
'Will there be much competition if someone is selling lottery tickets and
someone else is shaking a tin?' says Mr Sime. 'And the reality is that the
Treasury will take twice as much in tax out of the lottery as charities will
get from their share of its gross income.'
A shared source of anger throughout the UK is over the weakening of
charities' finances by having to pay VAT. Throughout this year's Edinburgh
International Festival volunteers from the Waverley Care Trust collected
money for its Milestone House Aids hospice. They raised around Pounds 5,000
 -the same amount as the hospice's costs will rise by having to pay VAT on
fuel bills.
A third area of concern, particularly strong in the relatively small
Scottish fundraising economy, involves the extent to which high-profile
one-off appeals distort public giving to the detriment of other charities.
One such appeal, for a children's hospital, raised Pounds 11m and another
for a children's hospice has now been launched with a Pounds 10m target.
'People are obviously entitled to give to whatever causes they choose, and
there is no certainty that money donated to big, highly-publicised appeals
would go to other causes,' said Mr Sime. 'But the voluntary sector has to
try to find ways of encouraging donors, particularly statutory funders and
grant making trusts, to become more strategic in their funding.'
Some of the questions raised in the SCVO's jubilee report would not have
been recognisable as issues to the council's founders 50 years ago.
Is there a definition of the voluntary sector that can embrace all the new
agencies, like trust hospitals, as well as traditional bodies? Can the
sector at one and the same time serve the purposes of government and
maintain its independence? They are reminders of the extent to which the
voluntary sector, in Scotland and the rest of the UK, is undergoing a period
of rapid challenge and change.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Survey of Charities Investment and Finance (5): How to run a
one-off appeal - Fundraising and funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since she spearheaded the Wishing Well Appeal for redeveloping London's
Great Ormond Street children's hospital, Marion Allford has found herself a
popular target for voluntary sector staff seeking tips on fundraising.
This is hardly surprising. The Wishing Well was one of the most remarkable
and successful single-issue appeals ever mounted in the UK. Launched in
October, 1987, the fundraising campaign, made famous by its logo of a
child's face smiling through a tear, had reached its original Pounds 30m
target by January 1989 - with no sign of the flow of money it had unleashed,
abating. It closed in June, 1989 - a year ahead of the original schedule -
having raised Pounds 54m. This rose to Pounds 84m when interest and
contributions from public funds were added.
Ms Allford, a fundraising consultant who specialises in charity appeals, has
now shared her experience in Charity Appeals - the Complete Guide to
Success*, a manual published in association with the Institute of Charity
Fundraising Managers and with the support of Business in the Community.
The book - net royalties will go to Great Ormond Street - is far more than a
description of the Wishing Well experience. It is a thorough, comprehensive
guide to running one-off capital appeals, giving detailed advice across such
wide-ranging aspects of fundraising as donor research, insurance, media
events, lotteries, budgeting and commercial partnerships.
Ms Allford acknowledges that the Wishing Well's emotional cause, sick
children, was one that few other charities could rival in terms of its
potential for gaining public support. Since the Great Ormond Street success,
two other hospitals - the Royal Marsden cancer hospital, London, and the
Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh - have, with advice from the
Wishing Well team, adopted similar appeal strategies with positive results.
They raised Pounds 25m and Pounds 11m respectively.
One-off appeals for single projects - whether on the scale of big hospital
appeals or to repair the organ of a village church - are a particular,
specialised sector of charitable fundraising. They need to make immediate
impact and reach their financial targets relatively quickly. Established
charities face different fundraising requirements, and many have developed
increasingly sophisticated methods to try to combat the effects of the
recession.
Techniques such as direct mail, now often conducted on charities' behalf by
agencies, became common in the 1970s and 1980s. They have recently been
complemented by attempts to target potential donors more precisely and
develop long-term relationships with them. There is also a trend towards
affinity marketing campaigns, linking charities' names with credit cards or
commercial products.
Professional, business-style fundraising techniques are usually only
available to big charities with substantial fundraising budgets and, at a
time when there has been little overall growth in total giving, this may
help explain why the largest charities are performing against the trend.
Charities Aid Foundation figures published last month show that Britain's
200 biggest charities increased their total income by 4 per cent in real
terms in 1991-92. In contrast, those in the 200-400 size bracket suffered a
9 per cent decline.
The CAF research reveals some striking recent changes in sources of
charities' voluntary income. Fundraising events produced 14 per cent less
income last year than in 1991. Revenue from charity shops, by contrast,
increased by 16 per cent.
Corporate support - both financial and in terms of staff secondments,
expertise and other assistance - forms a central part of many charities'
plans. This, like many other areas of fundraising, has been affected by the
recession. The CAF survey shows that only nine companies gave more than
Pounds 5m to charity in 1992-93, compared with 13 the previous year.
Many charities, particularly smaller ones, often face serious problems
meeting core funding - donors are generally more willing to finance
particular charitable projects and campaigns than to meet the basic running
costs.
Core funding difficulties can sometimes drive charities to closure. Trustees
of the National Council for Child Health, the only charity promoting
immunisation and preventative health care in children, decided at an
extraordinary meeting last month to wind up the organisation. The charity
had failed to persuade grant-making trusts or private sector donors to
contribute to its core funding after a three-year government grant had come
to an end.
Mediation UK, which promotes mediation rather than resort to the courts as a
means of resolving disputes, has warned that it will have to dismiss Ms
Marian Liebmann, its director, in February unless new funds are found. Ms
Liebmann says charitable trusts that financed Mediation UK's launch are not
prepared to continue providing core funding, and that the charity's
executive committee is spending so much time fundraising that it cannot
provide an adequate service.
The problem of finding funds to continue supporting projects once they have
been launched was highlighted last month by the Church Urban Fund, the only
national grant-making charity working exclusively in the inner cities and
peripheral estates.
In a report to the general synod of the Church of England, the fund - which
normally makes initial grants for between three and five years - said it had
expected that worthwhile social projects 'would be picked up by state or
local government funding, and that some activities would be taken on to a
parish's or diocese's ordinary funds.'
Such developments had occurred much less than expected, and the Church Urban
Fund will now have to introduce mechanisms to evaluate claims for
established projects' continued funding against the needs of emerging
schemes.
'We have to try to ensure both that worthwhile current work is not cut
prematurely short, and also that creative new activity is not stifled,' says
the report. The issue is one of the central dilemmas facing all
organisations funding the voluntary sector.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Survey of Charities Investment and Finance (4): 'Social
market' will join the economy - The Centris research project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Voluntary Action, a report published in October by the Home Office for the
Centris research project, will be best remembered for two things.
First, its remarkable recommendation that charitable status and accompanying
tax relief should be abolished. Second, the speed and force with which the
government, at the level of speeches by the Prime Minister and the Home
Secretary, distanced itself from the report and assured charities that tax
relief was safe.
So critical was the response to the report's plans for ending charitable
status and tax relief that it diverted attention from the remainder of its
contents, which recognised that the voluntary sector is undergoing
fundamental change as a growing number of charities deliver welfare services
financed by public contracts.
The time had come, suggested the report, for such charities, National Health
Service trust hospitals, and opted-out schools, housing associations and
private sector companies involved in social activities, to be linked in a
redefined third sector of the economy, or social market.
'The new economy would be regulated, controlled and promoted in various
ways, and a key feature of it would be that there would be sufficient
coherence to call it a third sector. Much service delivery. both at local
and at national level, presently in the public, private and voluntary
sectors, could go into it.'
The Centris report reflects a growing interest in the social market or
social economy, a concept which traditionally has had less clarity in the UK
than some other European Union countries, such as France. Publication of the
report coincided with a forum on the social economy organised by Unity Trust
Bank, which brought together representatives of a wide range of
organisations that could fit within a definition of the social economy.
As speakers at the forum acknowledged, the first hurdle - definition - is
not a easy one to jump. If all potential candidates were included, the
social economy could encompass building societies, provident private health
insurers and co-operatives, as well as charities, housing associations,
trust hospitals and similar organisations.
Mr Paul Ramadier, an EU official, told the Unity Trust seminar that on such
a broad definition, social economy organisations were of enormous economic
and social importance. There are 100m members of insurance and healthcare
mutuals in Europe, and social economy enterprises account for 20 per cent of
European savings. The co-operative sector has 60m members and has provided
3m jobs.
Mr Ramadier identified two social issues, unemployment, and the increasing
proportion of elderly people in the population, as examples of areas where
the contribution of organisations from the social economy would increase.
'The resources of the whole community will need mobilising, and in my view
that can only be done through social economy organisations.'
The seminar described social economy organisations as those 'engaging in
economic activity to fulfil primarily social, mutual or community
objectives.' While resisting a tighter definition, delegates agreed that it
would be helpful if policymakers took the sector's contribution more
seriously. There are plans for an annual social economy forum with a
standing committee, and an exchange of ideas and information.
A concern expressed at the Unity Trust seminar was that there was a
'damaging association of not-for-profit organisations with inefficiency' - a
particular concern in the voluntary sector. Many third sector organisations
believe their managerial skills stand up well to public or private sector
comparison, and are looking for ways of spreading this message.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Survey of Charities Investment and Finance (3): Good cause
to cut some charges - Competition among the banks for charity accounts is
hotting up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The good commercial news for charities is that competition among the main
banks for their accounts is hotting up. The less good news is that this has
not - not yet - translated into free banking for all.
But the competition is far from over. Last month, Girobank launched an
aggressive campaign with the somewhat over-stated claim that the high street
banks had effectively ended free banking for fund raisers, while the TSB
started an account aimed at charities.
Another bank has just carried out a direct mail exercise intended to entice
at least some of the largest of the 15,000 charities away from their current
banks.
In August, the Co-operative bank produced two new accounts for charities.
Lloyds has recently begun offering a 'treasurers account' aimed specifically
at people running charities or clubs.
Furthermore, after leaving its tariffs unchanged for some years, Midland is
now planning to offer what it says will be a more competitive and
'pro-active' deal in January.
Though the banks make little or no money from charities and clubs -
indeed,they emphasise that their aim is not to make a profit out of good
causes - the sector is so large that the main banks cannot afford not to be
in it at all. Banks want their market share.
To some banks, such as the TSB or the Co-operative, the sector is
particularly important, either because of their background as a mutual
institution or because of the particular style of banking they are selling.
Midland is offering the new deal as part of its strategy of becoming a more
'community-based' bank.
Unless the charity concerned is a large organisation, banks are unlikely to
offer much in the way of sophisticated financial services. While some banks
offer advice to people setting up or taking over small charities, most seem
to feel that what most charities want is a 'no nonsense' cheque account,
with perhaps a deposit account or some interest on the credit balance.
The largest charities are treated very much as businesses, and the banks say
that they accept that they should pay for the services they receive.
Those services, and the charges they pay, are negotiable. Negotiation with a
branch manager is also available to small charities or organisations to try
to improve the deal being offered by the banks.
So for small charities, free banking is available on the high street, but
may involve some shopping around and hard bargaining. You also need a clear
picture of how your organisation works: for example, whether it draws a lot
of cheques, or is able to maintain a steady credit balance.
You may well not have to be one of the (PIKE TO INSERT FIGURE) registered
charities to benefit from banks' professed desire not to make a profit out
of good causes. Other fund-raising activities or communal activities - such
as Brownies, or the cricket club - can also qualify for almost all the
ranges of accounts available for charities.
Only the TSB, so far, has restricted its latest offer to registered
charities, and even that may be widened over time. But the more
controversial your cause, or the more purely social the organisation, the
less flexible the bank is likely to prove if the terms for free banking in
the account are not met.
Banks generally make a sharp distinction between their charitable donations
and their charitable banking: so should charities. The fact that your
charity or cause has received some money from a local branch should not
incline you to bank there unless it really offers you the best deal.
On the other hand, if you have a bank manager involved in running your
organisation, you have a good chance of getting a good deal from his or her
bank. (If you have more than one, you may be able to run a competitive
tender for who gets your business.)
The right sort of account to get free banking will depend most heavily on
the level of credits and amount of activity going through an account.
Lloyds estimates that about 85 per cent of all charities and clubs carry out
fewer than 10 transactions a month. This is fortunate for charities if they
bank with Lloyds. The treasurers' account offers free banking and some
interest if the number of withdrawals is lower than 10 a month, but after
that the cost per withdrawal is Pounds 2.00.
Other high street banks have similar limits on withdrawals: Midland
currently offers free banking if in credit and fewer than 25 debit items a
quarter, with a charge of 74p per item beyond that.
Barclays has no published guidelines as such. It leaves to the discretion of
managers whether or not they should charge (after the one year's free
banking offered to all charities and clubs).
For a good cause, the broad guidance to managers would be to provide free
banking where there are up to about 15 transactions a quarter, although if a
steady balance was maintained, then more transactions could occur before
charging.
At both Barclays and at the National Westminster bank, the prevailing
emphasis is on the local manager's discretion, so the approach could vary
even between different branches in the same town - another argument for
shopping around.
Nat West says that it tries to do no more than cover its costs, and
estimates that, at current interest rates, Pounds 1000 in an account over
the year would support about 100 entries through the account.
All the banks emphasise the discretion of the local bank manager and the
need for flexibility in this area. Unless a charity has been extremely badly
run, a bank is unlikely to want to risk bad local publicity by charging for
a slight over-stepping of the numbers of transactions, or a slight drop in a
credit balance below the minimum level for a particular type of account.
All this means that, quite apart from general reasons for change (such as a
new treasurer taking over), it is worth ensuring that the inertia that
affects many people's attitude towards their personal bank accounts does not
apply to a bank account in the name of a charity.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Survey of Charities Investment and Finance (2): Gilts
swallow funds - Investment restrictions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Charities Act 1992 was much heralded at the time. It seemed to promise a
new era of investment freedom for charities restricted by the 1961 Trustee
Investments Act.
More than a year later, however, there is still no sign that the out-dated
requirement for charities to invest most of their funds in gilts will be
lifted in the near future.
The Trustee Investments Act (TIA), which in its day was a liberalising
measure, requires charities' investments to be split between 'wide' range
vehicles, such as UK equities (but only those passing certain conditions)
and UK authorised unit trusts, and 'narrow' range, which is basically UK
gilts. No more than half can be in the wide range.
It has been estimated that hundreds of millions of pounds of potential
investment returns have been lost since 1961 because of the
under-performance of gilts relative to equities. Nigel Siederer, director of
the Association of Charitable Foundations (ACF), which has been lobbying for
a broadening of the investment rules, says that if a charity had put half
its money in gilts and half in UK shares in 1961, it would now find that it
had about 85 per cent of its funds in shares, because of the comparative
growth rates.
The 1992 Act gave the Home Secretary the power to relax these restrictions
as he saw fit. This was expected to mean a swift move to allow charities to
invest a smaller portion of their funds in gilts, and more in equities,
including overseas equities, which tend to perform better over the long
term.
But the Act also stipulated that changes were only to be made with Treasury
approval. Cynics may argue that a Treasury with a large deficit to finance
is unlikely to welcome a change in the law which will almost inevitably lead
to a flood of gilts on to the market. Whatever the motivation, there has
been no indication from the government that relaxation is imminent.
The ACF has been consulting charities about what form any changes should
take. Mr Siederer's view is radical: 'If possible we would like the whole
notion of division of funds done away with. It seems much better to look at
requiring charities to take proper advice.'
As a compromise, he looks to the model of pension funds. 'Pension funds,
which are in a very similar position, will tend to keep 5 to 10 per cent of
their money in gilts anyway, but not very much more than that. We are
actually suggesting that the division should be moved from 50/50 to 90/10,
but we would rather see it done away with altogether.'
It is not known exactly how many charities are restricted by the TIA, but it
is thought to be about a third of the total. The TIA provisions apply only
to charities whose constitutions do not specify their investment remit. Most
of the larger, better known charities which may originally have been bound
by the TIA, have found it worth their while to go through the procedure of
asking their trustees to agree a change in their constitutions, to allow
investment managers a freer rein.
The TIA is not the only source of investment constraints. Many charities
have a need for regular income from their investments, which can be very
difficult to meet in the current investment climate, with its low interest
rates. This has coincided with the tail end of the recession, with its
impact on grant income and donations, to make more charities worried about
the income they are earning from their funds.
'The fixed proportion of income they require is set sufficiently high to
make the normal type of fund, with a high proportion in equities,
inappropriate, so they need more in fixed interest type assets,' says John
Harrison, of Fleming Investment Management.
This is still going to be the case for many charities even if the TIA
restrictions are relaxed. 'More liberalisation these days must be sensible,'
says Andrew Hind of Barnados, who is also chairman of the Charity Finance
Directors Group. But he adds: 'It is dangerous to think of charities as a
homogenous group. There are still going to be a large number of endowed
charities for whom income is the key thing. If you cannot touch the capital,
there is no point in having wonderful capital growth in equities, if that is
not available to you to meet your commitments.'
In the period leading up to last year's crisis in the exchange rate
mechanism, unconstrained charities also started to look abroad for income.
'The proportion of investment in overseas bonds has grown quite markedly
over the last 18 months or so,' says Mr Harrison. 'Overseas bonds were
almost unheard of in charities' portfolios two years ago, but are a fairly
high proportion of the total now - about 6 per cent.' However, now that
sterling is no longer so overvalued, he expects that proportion to decline.
'Sterling is where the expenses arise.'
Mr Harrison sees an historic tendency for charities to shadow pension funds
in their investment patterns, and for that reason he suspects that the
holding of overseas equities may grow: the average pension fund is 28 per
cent invested in overseas equities, whereas unconstrained charities have on
average only 24 per cent in overseas equities.
Mr Hind sees it in a different light. He thinks the way that the charities
act has highlighted trustees' responsibilities could make them more
conservative in their investment attitudes, pushing them away from overseas
equities and other investments which could be seen as in the least risky.
'Trustees are likely to want to play it safe even more than they did before.
Perhaps the impact will be felt in terms of the selection of fund managers,'
Mr Hind suggests. Trustees could feel uneasy about justifying the use of
anyone but the leading fund managers. 'I think we may see a concentration of
portfolios into the big five or 10, in a way that we have not seen before.'
One result of the 1992 Act which is already becoming visible is the winding
down of the office of the Official Custodian, whose role was to administer
the investments of thousands of charities, dealing with day to day dividend
payments and so on.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Survey of Charities Investment and Finance (1): No help from
the Budget - Charities are now at the centre of a redefinition of the UK
welfare state. As provision of welfare services fragments between the
public, private and voluntary sectors, charities are under pressure to
provide more - and to be financially efficient
</HEADLINE>

Do charities exist at all?
This pained, bewildered question was posed in the response to Mr Kenneth
Clarke's Budget from the Charities Tax Reform Group, which represents many
of the largest voluntary organisations.
The immediate cause for alarm was the absence of any specific new financial
support for charities in the Budget, and in particular the government's
failure to address the burning question of irrecoverable VAT which costs the
sector nearly Pounds 350m a year.
But the comment also signifies a wider sense of frustration over whether any
comprehensive strategy for charities exists at all. Government policies are
pushing the voluntary sector into mainstream welfare service delivery, while
many of its leaders feel that the financial and structural implications are
not being fully addressed by either ministers or some charities themselves.
1993 is closing dramatically for the sector. Voluntary Action, a report by a
group of former advisers to the Home Office voluntary services unit (the
Centris report) proposed in October that charities should literally not
exist at all, with recommendations for abolishing charitable status and tax
relief. The report argued that charities funded through contracts with the
public sector had surrendered their independence, and advocated a clear
split between charities delivering services and campaigning organisations.
The government reacted with immediate assurances that tax relief was safe,
but broader issues raised in the report will not disappear. As Mr Michael
Howard, home secretary, commented last month, the report had 'stimulated a
discussion on the very nature of voluntary activity.'
Some leading figures in the sector believe this debate, in the context of
the changing shape of the welfare state, is so significant that there should
be a royal commission on the voluntary sector.
As with any other sector of the economy, finance dominates the immediate
issues facing charities. The recession has had the inevitable effect of
curtailing income growth. But, according to the Charities Aid Foundation,
all charities have not been equally affected: the very biggest organisations
gained at the expense of the rest.
While the largest 200 fundraising charities saw their voluntary income grow
by 4 per cent in real terms last year; medium sized ones suffered a 9 per
cent reduction.
The same pattern applied to income from government and local authority fees
and grants, rents and investments. This rose by 5 per cent for the biggest
200, while falling by 16 per cent for charities in the medium-league 200-400
size bracket.
Financial pressures, combined with stricter requirements on trustees under
last year's Charities Act, are forcing charities of all sizes to give top
priority to the performance of their investments.
Under the act the Official Custodian, a public official who handled the
investments of many smaller charities, is returning them to the charities in
a staged exercise to 1996. Many of these organisations are being attracted
to common investment funds (CIFs), a unit trust arrangement for charities
operated by fund managers.
The first decision for charity trustees lacking previous experience of
dealing with fund managers is between choosing a charities specialist or one
of the large investment groups. Not surprisingly, both work hard to persuade
charity trustees that there is only one choice they could sensibly make.
Viscount Churchill, a director of Church, Charity, and Local Authority Fund
Managers - one of the specialists - says: 'We have long experience of
investing for charities and churches and find that our dedicated interest is
appreciated by clients. Our staff are particularly well equipped to deal
with questions arising from particular legal restrictions facing charities
and ethical and other concerns.
Big organisations also have teams of charity specialists on their staff.
While stressing the benefits of a large group, they are anxious to
demonstrate that their interest is not confined to large charities.
'We recognise the need to cater for smaller charities without full-time
finance managers, and offer a personal investment management service with
access to a fund manager, to charities with as little as Pounds 20,000 to
invest,' says Martyn Bensley, head of Fleming Investment Management's
charity division. As a spin off, Mr Bensley offers small charity clients
free places on management training courses run for Fleming's own staff.
Parts of the Charities Act are being phased in, and it had been expected
that regulations covering professional fundraising, reports and accounts and
collections would be introduced between March and December next year. At
least some of these - and the publication of a final version of the Charity
Commissioners' SORP 2 recommended accounting practices for charities - will
be delayed. The government has decided to await the outcome of a
deregulation task force examining charities.
While a tighter legal structure may help increase standards of efficiency
and integrity, it will not provide a short-cut to solving immediate
financial pressures.
Charities are particularly concerned that they cannot recover VAT even in
circumstances where local authorities that provide identical services do not
pay it, and had lobbied the Chancellor for a rebate system similar to a
Canadian one. Not only did the government fail to respond, but this year's
two budgets will increase financial burdens on charities. The National
Council for Voluntary Organisations estimates that VAT on power and cuts in
tax credits on dividends will cost the sector around Pounds 100m a year.
Increased petrol duty will bring a bill for Pounds 29m, while transferring
sick pay to employers will cost around Pounds 20m.
This year's community care reforms have seen charities drawn further into
the provision of services that were once a public sector monopoly. The
British Red Cross, for example, provides aftercare at home for people
released from hospital, medical equipment loan services, patient escorts and
transport under contract to local authorities.
The British Red Cross community programme depends greatly on volunteers, and
is a good example of the way in which charities are seeking to mobilise the
support of voluntary workers in far more sophisticated ways than simply
rattling tins on flag days. Volunteers working on the British Red Cross's
Home from Hospital scheme, which supports dependent patients after
discharge, undergo training including body mechanics and mobility, emergency
life support and hygiene practice. Some are being trained for specialised
tasks like administering eye drops and catheters.
Volunteering is something the government is keen to encourage, and Mr John
Major, the prime minister, recently announced plans to establish a national
network of volunteers. From next year, local organisations will be able to
submit bids under a new government-sponsored grant scheme for projects that
increase the scale and impact of voluntary effort. Mr Major also intends to
double the number of awards for voluntary service in future honours lists to
300.
Involvement of charities in the delivery of services is a reality and will
grow. But two concerns remain.
One is financial - a report last month produced by three charitable groups
after consultations with Whitehall departments warned the government not to
place additional burdens on the voluntary sector without making adequate
resources available.
The second issue is ethical, and raises the questions about the 'very nature
of voluntary activity' referred to by Mr Howard. Do charities that rely on
government finance lose their independence? How businesslike can a charity
become? While there is obvious need for managerial and financial efficiency,
there are signs of public aversion to over-commercial fundraising techniques
and charity shops that imitate High Street retailers. And will volunteers
continue giving their free time to huge, businesslike charities engaged in
open competition to win public sector contracts?
There has been a 20th century tradition of public bodies providing
mainstream welfare services, and charities acting as the advocates of the
service recipients. The government's purchaser-provider split in health and
community care has begun to reverse that process. Local authorities and
health authorities are becoming the champions of the consumer, and unelected
charities and arms-length trust hospitals and community units the providers
of services.
Some voluntary sector leaders think the implications of that issue alone are
profound enough to merit the attentions of a royal commission.

FT  14 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Recs strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   A 32 per cent interim dividend increase by London Electricity
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
by far the biggest rise in the recs' interim reporting season to date - took
the market by surprise and saw the group's shares hoisted to a record 655p
at the outset of trading.
Even the most optimistic analysts had been expecting an increase of nearer
20 per cent. However, the accompanying statement with the figures said that
the company is rebalancing its interim and final dividends, shifting from 30
per cent and 70 per cent to a one-third/two-thirds ratio. This took the
early shine off the shares and they slipped back to close unchanged on the
session at 644p.
London is the latest among a number of the electricity companies seeking to
rebalance their dividend payments. Last week Eastern, Midlands and East
Midlands all announced dividend rises in the region of 20 per cent.
Other electricity shares mostly moved similarly to London, making rapid
progress at the outset before slipping back. Midlands was an exception,
touching a peak 695p, before closing 5 ahead at 694p.
Northern Ireland Electricity, the best performing stock among the utilities
last week when the shares jumped 18.5 per cent, added 7 at 257p. Southern
Electricity, due to report this morning, is expected to boost its interim by
at least 20 per cent. The stock finished 4 cheaper at 672p.
Southern Water, also reporting this morning and expected to increase its
interim by a much more sedate 8.4 per cent to 7.7p, appreciated 11 to 648p.
This mirrored general switching operations by the institutions, out of the
recs and into the recently underperforming water issues. The latter were
also boosted by news that the European Commission is diluting its directives
on moves on water quality and waste water treatment.
Glaxo bucked the market trend as confirmation of a joint marketing agreement
was seen as paving the way for a batch of good news over Christmas. The
shares rose 4 to 686p.
The pharmaceuticals group released anticipated news that it had formed a
joint venture with Warner-Lambert, of the US, to develop and sell
over-the-counter versions of Glaxo drugs, particularly Zantac, its ulcer
treatment and biggest seller.
The company is also expected to be the main beneficiary of the traditional
end-of year approvals for drugs by the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA). Analysts expect the FDA to approve a tablet form of Glaxo's migraine
drug Imigran (known as Imitrex in the US) as well as Serevent, its asthma
drug. Goldman Sachs forecasts Imigran sales will hit Pounds 750m by 1997
from Pounds 116m in the year to June 1993.
Bank shares, among the market's best performers last week, suffered from
general lack of interest and sporadic bouts of profit-taking for much of the
session, but picked up well in the last half-hour. TSB was outstanding, the
shares approaching their all-time high and eventually standing a net 5 up at
248p on 5.1m traded.
Insurance issues featured in the day's big programme trade. Royal moved up 5
to 323p, although there were hints of possible end-of-year window dressing
in the shares.
Housebuilder Berkeley Group raced up 20 to a year's high of 480p as the
market registered its approval of a sparkling set of interim figures.
SmithKline Beecham clawed back from earlier weakness on news that the
Department of Health had granted it a licence to market Famvir, a new
anti-viral compound for treating herpes. The shares ended unchanged at 375p.
Meanwhile, Wellcome rebounded from a big fall on Friday, The stock gained 12
at 639p, with some investors squaring positions ahead of the company's
annual meeting on Thursday. BZW was said to have recommended the stock.
Chemicals company Croda International receded 5 to 338p as Hoare Govett
downgraded from a buy and recommended taking profits.
NatWest Securities was largely responsible for driving the recently
depressed oil sector sharply better. The broker said oil share prices
already discount unsustainably low oil prices, especially BP, which it said
'now discounts an unrealistically pessimistic long term oil price of around
Dollars 14'. BP shares moved up 9 to 324p.
Dull results from Greene King saw the shares retreat 15 to 553p and prompted
a series of downgrades from drinks analysts. Most pulled their full-year
forecasts back to the Pounds 21m level, a decrease of around 8 per cent.
They also said that the group's struggle to defend its market share was
likely to put a renewed bid for Morland - in which it still retains a 29 per
cent holding - off the agenda. Morland shares reflected this, slipping back
5 to 538p.
There was strong buying of Eurotunnel shares ahead of its egm tomorrow to
approve its Pounds 500m one-for-three rights issue. The Channel tunnel
operator has been enjoying a boost to sentiment since its official opening
last week. The shares jumped 33 to 509p in heavy London trade of nearly
500,000. The stock was the best performer on the Paris bourse.

FT  14 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Fisons down on warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bad news continued to surface at Fisons as the pharmaceuticals group
announced that it expected no profits this year and was sacking its chief
executive, Mr Cedric Scroggs. The one-time Footsie company saw its share
price slide 24 to 113p, its lowest level for more than nine years. Turnover
was unusually high at 30m shares as investors rushed to sell.
Part of the trading volume was said to have been prompted by a block of 1m
shares dealt at 138p as part of a programme trade - unfortunately on the buy
side.
The company said it was writing off Pounds 28m to cover a change in trading
policy and would take a Pounds 16m charge on its scientific instruments
division. It would also have to pay out for management con-sultancy and job
cuts. The net effect would be to reduce 1993 prospects from Pounds 100m to
zero. Forecasts for 1994 were cut back by around Pounds 20m, to Pounds 100m.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, placed its A-1 Fisons rating
on Credit Watch. Mr Nigel Barnes of Hoare Govett said: 'It is a real mess. I
would steer clear of Fisons, although it has some yield advantages now and
could be back in the bid target range once the rubbish is cleared.' The
group has been hit on previous occasions by profits warnings and management
changes over the past two years.

FT  14 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Premiums on the key December futures contract on the FT-SE Index hit zero
for the first time yesterday and gave a welcome relief to dealers struggling
to roll out their positions ahead of Friday's all-important expiry of the
December contract on the FT-SE 100, writes Peter John.
December futures opened strongly on a brief rush of hopes that the
Bundesbank would lower rates at its fortnightly council meeting on Thursday
and pave the way for a further cut in UK rates.
Unlike the underlying cash market the futures contract was unfettered by the
effect of dividend payments and spiked up to a high of 3,278. Then,
profit-taking took the contract back and by the afternoon it came back to
its estimated fair value premium and matched the underlying market for the
first tine.
This gave the arbitrageurs a chance to unwind their short positions by
buying the futures and selling the cash market. Much of the turnover
represented investors rolling out their holdings to the March contract,
which saw 5,255 lots traded by the close compared with 11,800 for December.
But the spread between March and December remained far higher than most
analysts estimates - it was at 20 by the close against fair value
calculations of a 15-point premium - and restrained some institutional
investors from making their move. December hit 3,259 by the official close
and rose again in after hours dealing.
Traded options turnover was down at only 25,600 contracts against 38,900 on
Friday, with Glaxo the most heavily traded stock option, having 2,202 lots
dealt. Asda was active on 1287 contracts.

FT  14 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities hold steady as the new
account opens - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Share prices put on an encouraging performance yesterday in the first
session of the extended three-week Christmas trading account in the UK
equity market. Some profits were taken but the final reading of minus 6.7
points on the FT-SE 100 Index was less than the technical downward
adjustments required by dividend payments on stocks in the Footsie 100-share
list. Earlier in the session, the Footsie had bounced from the 3,248 area to
end the day at 3,254.6.
Ex-dividend adjustments bedev-illed the market in early dealings, when some
traders claimed that the Seaq screens were slow to disclose the technical
fall in the market. After edging ahead by nearly 7 Footsie points at first,
the market drifted lower until taking a body blow from Fisons. The drug and
scientific equipment group announced a dividend cut, along with
restructuring moves and the departure of the chief executive.
Other factors subduing equities included the looming deadline for a solution
of the Gatt world trade dispute and the prospect of expiry on Friday of the
December contract on the FT-SE 100 Index, which has played such a
significant role in leading the stock market recently.
The premium on the December future contract, which has to be in line with
the stock market on Friday morning, was reduced yesterday, but the March
contract, which will take over from December as the futures leader, remained
at a good premium against cash.
London was also cautiously in line with continental European bourses, which
were awaiting the meeting on Thursday morning of the Bundesbank policy
council in the hope of a cut in German interest rates. However, London's
confidence that UK base rates will be reduced early in the new year appeared
undisturbed.
Buyers continued to push the second line stocks ahead and, in spite of the
heavy fall in Fisons shares, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index closed 6.3 up at a new
peak of 3,607.6. Traders reported a programme deal, worth around Pounds
100m, across the range of equities.
Seaq volume dipped to 653.8m shares from the 862.5m on Friday, when retail
business was worth Pounds 1.8bn, well to the top end of this year's daily
ranges. Retail business topped Pounds 6bn last week, confirming the highly
profitable levels of activity in UK equities.
The stock market was helped by a recovery in major oil stocks behind a rally
in crude oil prices. Buyers appeared from London early in the session and
were joined later by US investors. Pharmaceutical stocks were also in good
form.
The strongest features at first came in utilities, where electricity
generating groups scored further advances after London Electricity announced
a significant increase in the dividend payout. However, initial gains were
reduced.
Uncertainty over the outlook for interest rates in Germany weakened several
construction issues. Among the sectors closely linked to domestic interest
rates, however, stores did little more than shade easier in unimpressive
trade. Brewery and consumer sectors, too, gave up no more than a few pence.
Traders commented that the Christmas mood had begun to show itself on the
stock market. Although confirmation of a satisfactory outcome to the GATT
talks in Geneva will help sentiment, trading volumes are expected to slacken
once Friday's futures expiry is out of the way.

FT  14 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow surges as long bond fall
is shrugged off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US blue chip stocks staged an impressive late rally yesterday after
shrugging off weakness on the long end of the bond market, writes Frank
McGurty in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 23.76 ahead at 3,764.43,
setting a record in two consecutive sessions. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
gained 1.77 at 465.70, but the secondary markets were down, with the
American SE composite off 1.51 at 464.77 and the Nasdaq composite 1.02
easier at 759.72. New York SE volume was 256m shares and advancing issues
trailed decliners by 969 to 1,053.
Lacking fresh economic news to guide sentiment, investors turned to the
listless US Treasury market. With the 30-year government bond posting a
moderate loss in reaction to higher gold prices and an early jump in
commodity prices, equities quickly slipped into negative territory.
The closely watched Commodity Research Bureau index later shifted direction
and eased. But the inflation-sensitive long bond failed to recover and was
down  13/32 at 100 5/32 in late trading.
However, blue chips managed to establish a degree of independence in
mid-afternoon, buoyed in part by the recent spate of favourable economic
indicators. A two-point Dow gain at 2pm snowballed into a hefty advance.
With gold bullion up sharply on the Comex, precious metal issues advanced.
American Barrick rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 28 3/8 , Lac Minerals Dollars
 1/4 to Dollars 9 1/8 , Homestake Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 22 5/8 and Newmont
Gold Dollars 1 to Dollars 47 1/8 . Among non-ferrous metal producers,
Phelps-Dodge added Dollars 1 at Dollars 49 3/4 , Reynolds Dollars  1/2 at
Dollars 48 1/4 , Alcoa Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 73 5/8 and Cyprus Minerals
Dollars 1 at Dollars 26 1/8 .
At the top of the NYSE's most active list, IBM climbed Dollars 2 1/8 to
Dollars 56 3/8 on news of the sale of its Federal Systems division to Loral
for Dollars 1.58bn, about 50 per cent more than initially expected. Loral
forged ahead Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 35.
In the banking sector, BankAmerica was down Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 45,
Chemical Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 39 1/4 and Golden West Financial Dollars
3/8 at Dollars 38 1/8 after Smith Barney Shearson removed the stocks from
its 'recommended' list.
US Surgical jumped Dollars 2 to Dollars 22 7/8 after Smith Barney upgraded
the issue to 'outperform' from 'sell'. Healthsouth climbed Dollars 1 7/8 to
Dollars 21 3/4 .
Nutmeg Industries surged Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 17 3/8 on the announcement
that VF Corp had agreed to acquire the company for Dollars 17.50 a share. VF
put on Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 44 3/4.
Southwest Airlines advanced Dollars 2 to Dollars 36 after agreeing to
acquire Morris Air. Other airline stocks failed to benefit from a further
drop in Nymex crude oil futures. UAL lost Dollars 5/8 to Dollars 149 1/2,
AMR Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 68 3/8 and Alaska Air Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 14
7/8.
On the Nasdaq, ProCyte plummeted Dollars 4 5/8 to Dollars 10 7/8 after
suspending clinical trials of its lead product at the request of the US Food
and Drug Administration.
Canada
Toronto ended higher on strong gold issues and advancing mining stocks
buoyed by signs of improving metal market conditions.
The TSE 300 index put on 13.1 at 4,293.4 but declines led advances by 464 to
371 after volume of 66.7m shares. Golds and other mining climbed 1.90 and
1.55 per cent respectively.

FT  14 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Pacific Basin climbs
again with string of new highs
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Investors refrained from trading due to mounting uncertainty over the
stability of the seven-party coalition government, and the Nikkei average
closed just marginally higher, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
Volume totalled a mere 210m shares, down sharply from Friday's 600m, the
settlement day for December futures and options contracts. The 225-issue
index gained 69.90 at 17,237.33 after a day's low of 17,123.81 and high of
17,563.36.
Advances outscored declines by 594 to 400, with 174 issues unchanged. The
Topix index of all first section stocks put on 5.43 at 1,462.14, and in
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 1.19 to 1,201.52.
The Nikkei declined soon after the opening on arbitrage unwinding; it gained
ground in the early afternoon on a rise in the futures market, but late
profit-taking eroded most of the advance. Traders said attention was focused
on the negotiations within the coalition government over the partial lifting
of Japan's rice import ban.
The Socialist party, which depends on the rural vote, has threatened to
leave the coali-tion if the government decides to agree formally to the Gatt
compromise plan, and some investors feared that the worst case scenario
would be a break-up of the coalition.
Investors also awaited further details of the expected additional fiscal
package to be floated in the press. The government is likely to release the
details of the budget for the next business year start-ing March, along with
a stim-ulatory fiscal package after Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime
minister, reaches a dec-ision over the rice issue.
Foreigners led buying in export oriented high-technology stocks. Sony rose
Y140 to a year's high of Y5,340, as did Aiwa, up Y20 at Y1,840.
East Japan Railway gained Y5,000 at Y422,000 and Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone added Y5,000 at Y735,000. Other telecommunications-related issues
were also strong, with Fujitsu, the day's most active issue, climbing Y20 to
Y835 and NEC advancing Y24 to Y904.
Brokerages were easier on profit-taking, with Nomura Securities losing Y10
to Y1,840 and Nikko Securities declining Y20 to Y1,110.
Large retailers were strong on hopes of firm sales in the gift-giving
season. Mitsukoshi moved forward Y15 to Y805 and Tokyu Department Store Y22
to Y600. However, supermarket chains lost ground, Daiei shedding Y20 to
Y1,430 and Ito-Yokado Y10 to Y5,570.
In Osaka, the OSE average was 68.01 firmer at 19,322.79 in volume of 79.7m
shares.
Roundup
The region built on last week's gains, and produced six new record highs in
the process.
HONG KONG added modestly to last week's outstanding rise, the Hang Seng
index ending 20.48 higher at 10,248.59 in spite of a renewed Chinese
broadside against Governor Chris Patten's plans to push through his
democratic reforms for the colony.
Turnover was estimated at HKDollars 9.23bn, still strong but down from
Friday's record HKDollars 11.94bn. The most active blue chip, HSBC, advanced
HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 96.50.
SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index moved ahead 24.87 to end at a new
closing peak of 2,245.27 for the third straight trading day on a record
turnover, driven by retail and institutional buying. Volume was a record
736.7m shares valued at SDollars 1.60bn, against the previous high of 717.8m
shares worth SDollars 1.46bn set on October 28.
KUALA LUMPUR hit its new high on speculative and institutional buying, which
took the KLSE composite index up 14.50 to 1,090.35, volume rising from 754m
to 939m shares.
MANILA's brokers, full of enthusiasm, said that equities were building up
for a bull market in 1994. Yesterday's 65.92 gain to a new high of 2,579.21
left it more than doubled from the 1993 low of 1,270.68 on January 4.
KARACHI, continuing to put political stability ahead of a weak cotton crop,
managed its record peak on settlement day, climbing sharply as local traders
followed buying by foreign funds. The KSE index strengthened 30.69 to
1,888.24.
BOMBAY ended higher after an early retreat, lower prices triggering a fresh
round of buying. The BSE index closed 52.91 up at 3,454.81 and brokers said
foreign funds were still voraciously on feed.
TAIWAN made an eight-month high and turnover, too, jumped to its highest
level since March. The weighted index put on 3.8 per cent, closing 178.23
stronger at 4,929.81. Turnover soared to TDollars 93.87bn, from TDollars
49.68bn in Saturday's shortened session. Foreign interest in financials
boosted late buying across the board.
SEOUL, the prime exception, was dragged lower by profit-taking and
institutional selling, the composite index fin-ishing 16.85 down at 850.03.
Securities houses face a government order requiring them to liquidate
holdings beyond 60 per cent of their equity capital by the end of the year.

FT  14 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets: Hong Kong posts year's best rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Continued strong liquidity in a market rapidly becoming short of stock
combined with technical factors to keep Hong Kong firmly on the upward
escalator last week, recording the sharpest five-day advance for any market
this year.
Miss Sara Dodd of HG Asia sees liquidity as the key to Hong Kong's 10 per
cent rise last week, which took the cumulative gain over the last 12 months
to more than 98 per cent as measured by the FT-Actuaries World indices in
local currency terms.
Miss Dodd believes that political developments are having little affect on
the market's direction, noting that further strong demand has been evident
from the US and that there have been reports of some large purchases from
Japan.
There have been stories, too, that local Hong Kong-Chinese investors have
come to the conclusion that their earlier hopes of an easier market were
little more than wishful thinking.
James Capel notes that the market became increasingly technical, with
futures trading reflecting options hedging. Capel believes that, in its
present mood, the market could rise from the present 10,248 to 12,000,
although because of the technical nature of trading it could also fall back
from that level very quickly.
European markets produced a largely lacklustre performance, although Italy
was an exception as the second round of local elections provided no
unpleasant surprises and parliamentary passage of the budget looked to be
back on track.
In a review of the Italian market, Mr Oliver Kamm and Mr William Cowan of
James Capel note that the final results of the local elections make the PDS
the leading party in Italy and that, as such, it has to be taken seriously
as a potential partner in any future government.
However, they believe the market has already discounted a worst case
scenario of intensifying political instability.
They add that while the equity market has been depressed since August
because of investor perceptions about political risk, as well as concern
about the volume of rights issues and forthcoming privatisations,
fundamental macroeconomic prospects are favourable over the next 12 months.
The team says that following its sharp decline since August, the market
offers reasonable rather than compelling valuations, trading on a multiple
of 26 times 1993 earnings and 22 times for 1994.

FT  14 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt slips back after
hitting all time high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Early gains on most senior bourses had disappeared by mid-afternoon
yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT rose to a new all-time high on short covering, the DAX index
hitting an intraday 2,187.28, and lost the better part of its gains
thereafter. The index closed 11.62 higher at 2,172.75 and shed most of that
gain in the post bourse, where the Ibis-indicated close was 2,163.82.
Mr Jens Wiecking of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf said that the market began to
look uncomfortable at lunchtime when the DAX future, usually quoted at a
premium to the cash market, was actually quoted at a discount for a while.
'Many insurance companies had hedged their portfolios by selling futures
rather than the cash market,' said Mr Wiecking, 'and then had to buy the
futures back.'
Turnover rose from DM9.1bn to DM9.4bn. Metallgesellschaft fell another DM30,
or 9.3 per cent to DM293 on its recent, poor results and liquidity problems
associated with oil market contracts. AEG fell another DM6 to DM169 after an
earlier run-up on restructuring hopes.
Thyssen, strong late last week, put on DM5 to DM264.50 on a report that the
group would consider pulling out of the steel business entirely, in order to
protect the 60 per cent of its workforce in other areas; among the other
risers, the chemicals, precious metals and pharmaceuticals group, Degussa,
climbed DM10 to DM463 ahead of its preliminary results for 1993.
PARIS had a morning in positive territory, but ended with the CAC-40 index
1.82 lower at 2,196.31 after the EC Trade Commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan,
said in the afternoon that some details of the GATT talks would have to be
worked out after the December 15 deadline.
Turnover rose from FFr3.34bn to FFr3.9bn. Eurotunnel jumped by 6.3 per cent,
rising FFr2.65 to FFr44.75 in heavy volume of 5.8m shares following the
handover of the tunnel, said brokers, and acceptance by Transmarche Link of
the principle of being paid in Eurotunnel shares. The defence and
electronics group, Thomson-CSF, was up FFr4.70 at FFr159.70.
Elf Aquitaine, the oil company, fell FFr2.60 to FFr417.80.
The chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, Rhone-Poulenc, fell FFr2.60 to
FFr149.50 on an earnings downgrade by Goldman Sachs. After hours, its merger
with Institut Merieux was postponed as the latter estimated the cost to
profits, this year and next, of withdrawing albumin products.
ZURICH stayed on the upgrade and set a new high, the SMI index adding 15.7
to 2,876.9 on the outlook for interest rates and corporate profits.
Alusuisse, a recent laggard, rose SFr11 to a year's high of SFr587 on strong
demand from US funds which are turning their attention to cyclicals from
banks and pharmaceuticals. A rise in aluminium prices was attributed to
reports that Russia was considering a 10 per cent cut in production to
reduce the current glut which has depressed world markets.
Swiss Reinsurance added SFr10 to SFr770 on the view that the shares had more
upward potential once the current rights issue had been digested by the
market.
AMSTERDAM drifted lower amid light futures-related selling, although the
undertone remained firm. The CBS Tendency index eased 0.1 to 139.9.
Royal Dutch added 90 cents to Fl 196.70 on reports that the government would
lift a 10-year ban on offshore gas and oil drilling in the environmentally
sensitive Wadden Sea at a news conference after the market closed. The area
contains 100bn-200bn cubic metres of natural gas and an unknown quantity of
oil.
Unilever shed Fl 2.60 to Fl 219.20: the recent high share price has prompted
Goldman Sachs to remove it from its recommended list.
Van Ommeren picked up Fl 1.50 to Fl 49.10 and Pakhoed Fl 1.10 to Fl 42.60:
both fell sharply on Friday when the government announced it was moving its
strategic oil reserves from Rotterdam Port to German salt caves.
MILAN resumed its advance, although shares were unable to maintain their
best levels amid some late profit-taking ahead of tomorrow's end of the
December account. The Comit index added 5.34 to 588.45.
Renewed enthusiasm for privatisation candidates helped the market along. Sip
added L65 or 1.9 per cent to L3,410 and Stet rose L105 or 2.7 per cent to
L4,020.
Credito Italiano slid L30 to L2,350 on profit-taking after its strong gains
last week when its share offer was heavily oversubscribed. Fiat added L111
to L4,276 as interest in the company's rights spread out to the ordinary
shares. Rights not taken up from the recent issue are being traded on the
market this week.
DUBLIN's ISEQ overall index picked up 15.70 to 1,838.63, the market driven
by strong foreign demand for Smurfit. The paper and packaging group, a
laggard early in the year, added another 7p to IPounds 2.95: it has risen
from a low of IPounds 2.20 at the end of October in line with an improving
paper sector on Wall Street.
STOCKHOLM's Affarsvarlden index added 7.2 at 1,357.8, helped by a SKr12 rise
in Ericsson 'B' to SKr332 as foreign selling pressure eased.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Markets Report: D-Mark edges lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The D-Mark rose in early dealings as hopes that the Bundesbank might cut
interest rates this week faded. However, it slipped later to finish slightly
weaker against the US dollar and some European currencies, writes Conner
Middelmann.
The German currency received an early lift from a report in the Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung daily newspaper that the Bundesbank's central bank
council is not planning to lower official interest rates on Thursday - its
last meeting of the year.
Citing an unnamed central bank source, the paper said the Bundesbank had
made clear by setting securities repurchase agreements at a fixed rate of 6
per cent until January 5 that there would be no more interest rate cuts
before the year-end. There has been some speculation that the Bundesbank may
lower its 5.75 per cent discount rate and 6.75 per cent Lombard rate at the
meeting.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, said last week that the
policy-making body would discuss the M3 money supply growth target for 1994
at this week's meeting. He also said that next year's M3 target is likely to
be close to this year's 4.5 to 6.5 per cent range. According to a poll of
private economists conducted by Reuters, the Bundesbank is widely expected
to set an unchanged or slightly lower target.
The German overnight rate tightened slightly amid the outflow of monthly tax
payments. Call money was changing hands at around 6.10 per cent, up from
around 6.05 per cent on Friday.
The March three-month Euromark interest-rate contract on the Liffe eased by
0.05 point to 94.52 on strong volume on fading hopes for a rate reduction
this week.
The dollar traded around DM1.6950 early in the day, but strengthened on late
short-covering to reach a high of DM1.7065. It ended at DM1.7050, up from
DM1.6990 at Friday's close. In New York it finished at DM1.7080. Most
traders expect the US currency to remain in a relatively narrow trading
range between DM1.69 and DM1.73 until the year-end.
The D-Mark also weakened against the French franc, although traders reported
few flows and said that volume was thin.
The French franc strengthened within its former narrow ERM fluctuation band
against the D-Mark to a high of FFr3.421, before ending at FFr3.422, up from
FFr3.424 on Friday.
The Bank of France left its 6.20 per cent intervention rate unchanged at its
latest open-market operation, injecting FFr9.8bn of liquidity into the money
market.
The Belgian franc closed at BFr20.94 to the D-Mark, down from BFr20.91 on
Friday. The Danish krone finished at DKr3.923 per D-Mark, slipping from
Friday's DKr3.913, while the Italian lira weakened in volatile trade to
L989.4 from Friday's L985.8 close.
The pound firmed against the D-Mark but lost some ground to the dollar. It
closed at DM2.5425, up from a previous DM2.5400. Against the dollar,
sterling ended at Dollars 1.4905, down from Dollars 1.4950.
The latest UK price data, indicating continued low inflation pressures,
rekindled hopes of further interest rate reductions but did little to weaken
the pound. Industrial output in October rose 0.7 per cent, while
manufacturing output was up 0.1 per cent, largely in line with market
expectations.
The short sterling futures contract reflected continued expectations of
another near-term base rate cut. The March contract gained 4 basis points at
94.96, while the December contract, which expires tomorrow, was unchanged at
94.64.
Traders are eyeing tomorrow's release of the November retail price index and
November retail sales data for further clues on the inflation picture and
the outlook for UK interest rates. 'There is a feeling that Wednesday could
be the (Bank of England's) window of opportunity, if the numbers are good,'
said a London money dealer.
The market median forecast for RPI (ex-mortgage interest payments) is for an
unchanged 2.8 per cent year-on-year. Retail sales are expected to have
increased by 0.2 per cent on the month and by 3.6 per cent on the year.
The sterling money market was relatively tight, traders said. The Bank of
England forecast a shortage of around Pounds 1.65bn in the morning, and in
early operations purchased bills totalling Pounds 1bn for resale to the
market on January 4 at an interest rate of 5 13/32 per cent.
In further operations, the Bank bought bills amounting to Pounds 222m at 5
3/8 per cent, followed by Pounds 42m of bills at the same rate in the
afternoon. It provided late assistance of around Pounds 400m.
The Japanese yen was little changed against the dollar, but observers said
it is likely to continue its weakening trend against the US currency in
coming months. It ended at Y108.95 to the dollar, up mildly from Y109.15 on
Friday. It closed at Y108.98 in New York.
With the Japanese economy all but ground to a halt, Mr Tony Baron, chief
strategist at PaineWebber in London, is calling for continued sharp interest
rate cuts by the Bank of Japan to stimulate growth.
Mr Baron expects the 1.75 per cent official discount rate to be reduced to
at least 1 per cent, if not lower. Moreover, as the US economy picks up and
the Federal Reserve shifts towards a tightening bias, he expects the yen to
drop to Y112 by the end of January and as low as Y125 by the end of 1994.

Dutch pig and poultry farmers will be forced by 1995 to cut the amount of
pollution-causing manure their animals produce to 30 per cent below 1986
levels under a law passed by parliament yesterday, the ANP news agency said,
reports Reuter from the Hague.
If the farmers cannot reduce the amount of phosphorous nutrient in the
manure applied to land by 30 per cent they will will be required to cut
animal numbers. Further reductions will be required up to the year 2000 to
achieve levels the land can absorb.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Talks on European zinc output
cuts 'encouraging'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European zinc producers are still on course to implement a scheme to
eliminate substantial over-capacity by the permanent closure of one or two
smelters next year. The cost of the so-called 'shut-down' scheme would be
met by the European industry as a whole.
A weekend meeting between senior industry executives in Brussels made good
progress, it was suggested yesterday. A draft agreement was discussed in
detail and this set out the terms and obligations for each individual
company taking part in the shut-down scheme, said Eurometaux, the European
non-ferrous metals association.
Discussions with the European Union authorities had also been 'encouraging'
 -EU approval is needed before the proposals can be implemented.
One industry executive said there was 'genuinely constructive discussion'
during the weekend talks and the metals market had been wrong to assume that
an instant decision would be possible. 'These things take time,' he said.
The producers are to meet again in mid-January.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US floods wash up winners as
well as losers - While some farmers' crops were devastated others flourished
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Farmers are always subject to the vagaries of weather, but this year in the
US mother nature was more fickle than usual, flooding grain crops in the
midwest and visiting drought on the south-east. Within the affected areas
neighbours had sharply different fates: a farmer on high ground in Iowa
could boast a record maize crop while his lowland colleague was wiped out by
a swollen river.
'There was a real dichotomy of winners and losers. That is the real outcome
of a year like this one,' says Mr Alan Barkema, agricultural economist with
the Kansas City Federal Reserve.
The harsh weather reduced the US maize harvest, the largest crop in the US,
to 6.4bn bushels (162m tonnes), 30 per cent below the record 1992 harvest.
Soyabean production dropped 19 per cent, to 1.8bn bushels, according the the
US Department of Agriculture's latest estimates. The harvest shortfall
leaves the US with just enough feedgrains to meet this year's domestic and
export needs, and very little carryover to cushion any problems with the
1994 harvest.
While analysts are busy counting bushels and fretting over grain supplies,
farmers who escaped disaster are enjoying their best year ever. Net farm
income is forecast to rise to a record Dollars 59bn in 1993, and thanks to
the drawdown in grain stocks, the government is asking grain farmers to
plant fencepost-to-fencepost next year, eliminating acreage set-aside
programmes for the first time since supply-management farm programmes were
initiated in 1981.
As a result, Mr Bob McElroy, a financial analyst with the Agriculture
Department, estimates that net cash farm income in 1994 will be very close
to the 1993 record. The three-year streak of farm prosperity, he explains,
stems from the boom-and-bust nature of the crop sequences.
The 1992 maize harvest was huge, giving farmers more grain to sell, but at
low prices. As crop conditions worsened in the first half of this year,
grain prices rose, allowing farmers to market stocks at high prices. Mr
McElroy, like many other analysts, expects prices to remain firm through the
first half of 1994, benefitting farmers who still have grain to sell.
In addition, the Dollars 2.5bn in disaster relief payments authorised for
farmers by congress have begun to trickle into farm communities, partly
offsetting the estimated Dollars 5bn in crop losses suffered this year.
With more land coming into production next year (some 80m acres will be
planted to maize) and with ample moisture remaining in midwestern soils,
there is a chance for a bumper harvest next summer. However, a good crop is
far from certain. Agronomists say the after-effects of flood-drifted soil,
soggy fields and disabled equipment could delay spring plantings along
midwestern rivers and provide enough uncertainty to continue to support
world grain prices.
In the meantime, seed and fertiliser producers are gearing up for a busy
spring and farmers who have reaped profits are becoming re-acquainted with
their tractor and combine harvester dealers. US tractor sales were up 9 per
cent in the year to October and the nation's top tractor makers - Deere and
Company and the JI Case division of Tenneco - have boosted production in the
fourth quarter.
Deere reported fourth quarter profits of Dollars 103.5m this week, up from
Dollars 4.2m last year, with a large portion of the improvement coming from
North American sales of agricultural equipment. Case expects to have Dollars
1.6bn in agricultural sales in the US this year.
Mr Tom Reynolds, an economist at Deere, is cautious in his forecasts. He
thinks low interest rates, increased income, and to some extent, increased
confidence in the farm outlook have helped equipment sales. He says,
however: 'It is hard for me to say we'll see the start of a boom in farm
equipment sales. I think we'll see a small improvement, not a boom'.
Other measures of the farm economy - land values and farm debt - also
indicate that US agriculture is in a period of slow but solid growth. Land
values have been rising 2.5 to 3.5 per cent a year, in step with the overall
growth of the US economy. US farm debt, which peaked at Dollars 194bn in the
depths of the farm recession in 1984, has subsided to Dollars 138bn.
Farmers have been slow to take on new debt this year, an indication that
they also are not expecting an agricultural boom. Although grain and
soyabean stocks are historically low, and prices are high, producers are
aware that, even if the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations
are concluded successfully, world agricultural trade is not going to recover
soon.
High soyabean prices have already inspired record plantings in Argentina and
Brazil, and those crops will compete with US supplies on world markets. The
former Soviet Union, the US's best grain customer two years ago, is still
suffering credit problems, while China, its second-biggest customer, is
reducing wheat imports. Overall, the US Deparment of Agriculture forecasts
that feedgrain exports will drop to 1.35bn bushels in the 1994 fiscal year,
down 15 per cent from 1993 and well below the peak of 2.2bn.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Finnish technology to clean up
Russian smelter's emissions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, REUTER and LAURIE MORSE

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW, CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pollution from the Kandalaksha aluminium smelter in Russia will be
substantially reduced by an upgrading to be carried out by Kumera
Corporation, a Finnish engineering company, using technology from Reynolds
Metals of the US.
The project, which is to cost less than USDollars 50m, will also boost
Kandalaksha's capacity from 62,000 to 70,000 tonnes a year.
Kumera suggests that this is the first environmental modernisation project
for a complete aluminium smelter in Russia since privatisation of the
industry started there.
The Finnish government will give some financial support to the project
because Kandalaksha is on the Kola Peninsula and some of its fluoride
emissions are blown across the border into Finland.
Reynolds has well-tried technology to improve the performance of outdated
Soderberg smelters and Mr Vesa Kumpulainen, Kumera's chief executive, says
this technology not only cuts pollution substantially but also saves energy.
Once the project has received Russian government approval, the work is
expected to be completed in 30 months.
The Russian government is recommending that its aluminium industry should
make across-the-board production cuts of 10 per cent, Mr Alexander Deineko,
deputy head of the Russian industry department, said, Reuter reports from
Moscow.
He admitted, however, that he did not know how the newly-independent
producers - most of the smelters are now joint-stock companies - would react
to this official recommendation, which follows meetings with officials from
other aluminium-producing countries in Washington.
Another official, Mr Ruben Petrosyan, head of Raznoimport, Russia's
aluminium export organisation, said all the countries were considering a 10
per cent production cut and an accord might be reached at talks in Brussels
on January 18.
The New York Mercantile Exchange, the big energy futures market, is planning
to revive a failed aluminium futures contract in an effort to capitalise on
price risks created by the world oversupply of aluminium, writes Laurie
Morse in Chicago.
Mr Daniel Rappaport, the chairman of Nymex, said that he hoped to launch
aluminium futures in conjunction with his exchange's proposed merger with
New York's Commodity Exchange, the precious metals futures exchange, but
would go ahead with the project even if the merger failed.
Nymex, best known for its successful crude oil futures and options, also
trades platinum futures. Mr Rappaport said that if the foray into aluminium
was successful, the exchange would attempt to establish trading in zinc and
nickel futures.
The exchange's board members are scheduled to vote on the Dollars 50m Comex
merger package this week. If the plan is cleared by the board, it must then
be approved by Comex directors and presented for approval to the memberships
of both exchanges. Comex's volume and seat values have jumped this year in
the wake of the 1993 gold rally, causing some members to question the value
of the merger and putting the outcome of the plan in doubt.
Mr Rappaport promised Comex members that he would invest heavily in a new
aluminium contract if the merger was approved.
Comex launched an aluminium futures contract in 1984, but volume was thin
from the outset and it last traded in November 1990. The exchange formally
delisted the contract this year.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Government Bonds: Gilts lifted by producer prices and rate
cut hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UK government bonds continued their inexorable rise yesterday, helped by the
release of favourable economic data and the expectation that inflation will
stay low, possibly paving the way for a further cut in the base rate.
The biggest gains were seen in the index-linked sector, where long-dated
issues rose over a point. Dealers said the sharp rise reflected the fact
that the index-linked sector had underperformed the rest of the market
recently and was simply 'catching up', encouraged by the release of some
strong buy recommendations from a couple of gilt-edged specialists.
Among conventional stocks, the longer-dated issues performed well, with
gains of over half a point on the day, spurred on by the producer price
data.
Producer output prices were unchanged in November compared with October,
while the annual rate fell to 3.6 per cent from 4 per cent. Input prices
showed a monthly increase of 1.2 per cent, but the yearly rate declined by
1.8 per cent.
While the figures provided cheer for the gilts market by suggesting that
inflationary pressures remain subdued, dealers said the key focus of the
market is the release tomorrow of the Retail Price Index. Market
participants expect underlying inflation to be unchanged or slightly lower
for November.
Gatt and the Bundesbank provided the two main talking points in the European
government bond markets.
Most market participants are optimistic about the prospects of an agreement
on Gatt by the December 15 deadline. In addition, there is plenty of
speculation that the Bundesbank may cut its official interest rates at
Thursday's council meeting.
German government bond futures reached a new high on reasonably good volume,
with dealers saying the market was buoyed by hopes of a cut in the discount
and Lombard interest rates this Thursday.
Even though the repo rate was fixed at 6.00 per cent until January 5, some
dealers said there was a chance of a 25 - 50 basis point cut in headline
rates at this week's council meeting.
In addition, the market will be closely watching the Bundesbank's M3 target
announcement.
The bund futures contract, which opened at 100.76, hit a new all-time high
of 100.95 before slipping back to 100.86 by late afternoon.
Among the high-yielding European markets, Italy ended nearly half a point
higher, helped by a more settled political background, expectations that the
1994 budget will be approved, and hopes of a possible cut in official
interest rates before Christmas.
However, some dealers said that the thin, pre-holiday volume meant that the
market's move was somewhat exaggerated.
Spanish government bonds closed lower, mainly on domestic selling.
Japanese government bonds ended firmer in the cash market as market
participants shrugged off last Friday's news of 0.5 per cent growth in
third-quarter GDP and chose instead to focus on the gloomy quarterly Tankan
survey from the Bank of Japan.
The yield on the benchmark No 157 JGB opened at 3.125 per cent and ended at
3.12 per cent, having traded at 3.1 per cent (corresponding to the lowest
benchmark yield in over six years).
The market had expected the third-quarter GDP figures to show a decline
rather than a rise.
However, dealers said that the market paid more attention to the Tankan
report, which helped support speculation that the Bank of Japan may lower
interest rates in order to stimulate the economy.
Longer-dated US Treasury bonds posted moderate losses amid a mixed reading
on commodity prices, but notes with shorter maturities were unchanged in
light activity.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  13/32 lower at
100 5/16 with the yield climbing by about 3 basis points to 6.233 per cent.
At the short end of the market, the two-year note was unchanged at 100 1/32
, yielding 4.216 per cent.
After falling late on Friday despite a tame report on November consumer
prices, the inflation-sensitive long bond showed further weakness in the
face of a sharp rise in Comex gold prices and an early increase in the
closely watched Commodity Research Bureau index.
The 30-year issue remained anchored in negative territory throughout the
session, even though Nymex January crude oil futures - down 46 cents a
barrel - offered a more positive picture. The 21-commodity CRB index later
reversed direction to show a 0.76 decline to 224.43 late in the day, but the
long bond failed to bounce back.
Most traders were keeping to the sidelines, as the market looked ahead to
November retail sales data, which are due out today.
Forecasts centre on a 0.4 per cent increase, after a 1.5 per cent jump the
previous month.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), acting to dampen a sharp
rise in stock prices, is banning carry-forward deals at four major
exchanges, Reuter reports from Bombay.
The SEBI said the ban would apply to the Bombay, Calcutta, Ahmedabad and
Delhi stock markets. Brokers have been given until the middle of January to
liquidate their carry-forward positions.
The Bombay 30-share index has risen by 32 per cent since the start of
November. The SEBI ordered brokers to reduce their forward positions by 50
per cent by the end of the current account period, which ends on January 6.
The remaining forward positions will have to be liquidated during the
following account period ending in mid-January.
Brokers said the ban showed that the government was still haunted by last
year's Dollars 1.28bn securities scandal.

FT  14 DEC 93 / International Bonds: Fisons offers to buy back or exchange
outstanding issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fisons, the UK pharmaceutical company which yesterday announced a radical
restructuring plan, sought to protect investor confidence by offering to buy
back its outstanding bonds or exchange them for new bonds with a shorter
maturity.
In October, Fisons made its first public bond offering since 1986 when it
raised Pounds 100m through an offering of 10-year Eurobonds with a coupon of
8 per cent. At the launch, the bonds were priced to yield 120 basis points
over the 8 per cent UK government bond (gilt) due 2003.
At the time, the yield spread was judged to be fair in view of the company's
lack of a long-term credit rating and its poor equity performance. However,
the bonds did not perform well in the secondary market and their yield
spread over gilts widened gradually. By last Friday, the bonds were yielding
145 basis points over 10-year gilts.
JP Morgan, which lead-managed the deal for Fisons, said that holders of the
bonds could sell them outright at Friday's closing level or exchange them
for a new offering of five-year bonds with a coupon of around 7.5 per cent
on a one-for-one basis.
The new bonds will be priced to yield around 150 basis points over the 6 per
cent gilt due 1999 on the first day of the exchange period, which is
expected to take place in the new year and last for four business days.
'Fisons is concerned about its standing with the public investor base and as
a result is taking responsible action in order to ensure an orderly market,'
a JP Morgan official said.
Fisons's market stabilisation operation appeared to have been successful
yesterday. Although JP Morgan said it had bought back some bonds, there no
reports of panic selling and the spread on the bonds remained at 145 basis
points.
Syndicate managers said that most investors appeared to be waiting for the
dust to settle before deciding whether to sell their bonds or exchange them
for the shorter maturity.
The news of the restructuring prompted Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's, the
international rating agencies, to place Fisons' commercial paper ratings, of
A-1 and Prime-1 respectively, under review for a possible downgrade.
Elsewhere, the Australian subsidiary of Toronto Dominion Bank raised
CDollars 100m through an offering of five-year Eurobonds. The proceeds were
thought to have been swapped into Australian dollars.
An official at lead manager ScotiaMcLeod said that the issue would inject
fresh liquidity into the five-year area of the Euro-Canadian dollar sector
which currently appeals to retail investors in the Benelux region.
The bonds were priced to yield 42 basis points over the new five-year
Canadian Treasury benchmark and when they were freed to trade the spread
remained unchanged.

<TEXT>
Smith New Court, the UK equities market-maker, has joined OMLX, the London
Securities and Derivatives Exchange, with a view to becoming a market-maker
in the exchange's planned FT-SE Mid-250 derivative contracts.
The London Stock Exchange last month awarded licences to introduce
derivatives on the index of medium-sized UK companies to both OMLX and the
London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange (Liffe), which
already lists futures and options on the FT-SE 100.
Smith New Court already trades Mid-250 futures over-the-counter, according
to Mr Lenny Barshack, its director of derivatives, who added that the firm
was keen to support this and other contracts on sectors of the UK stock
market.
OMLX plans to launch the new derivative contracts in the first quarter of
1994, according to chief executive Mr Lynton Jones, and is considering
appointing two tiers of market-makers, with different levels of obligations.
This issue is currently being examined by the Mid-250 Steering Group, of
which Smith New Court is a member. Liffe has not yet set a launch date for
the new instruments.

FT  14 DEC 93 / International Company News: Germans launch blitz on British
palate - Expansion plans of Rewe, the food retailer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A German businessman who describes himself as a lover of the UK is setting
out on a personal mission - to corrupt the eating habits of the average
British family.
'We helped to corrupt the food culture of Germany,' says Mr Hans Reischl,
the man who has built up the privately-owned Rewe group into Germany's
largest food retailer, 'and we are hoping to do the same in the UK.'
Mr Reischl, who wears English-made shoes and spends two weeks of each year
on holiday in the UK, said in a recent interview at the Rewe group's Cologne
headquarters that the quality of food in mainstream British supermarkets was
too high.
'I want to give the British consumer more choice about where he or she goes
shopping,' Mr Reischl declared. 'We want to bring greater competition to the
UK market. This will inevitably lead to a deterioration of your
food-culture.'
The process has already begun. Following the purchase of a 26 per cent stake
in Budgens, the UK food retailer, Rewe has opened the first eight or nine
stores in a planned chain of at least 40 discount food stores.
Modelled on the down-market format which has taken Rewe's sales in Germany
to DM33bn (Dollars 19.5bn) last year, these stores offer 1,200 to 1,300
items of stock compared to 6,000 in a normal Budgens store.
Prices will be at least 10 per cent lower than in normal food supermarkets.
'There is no limit to our expansion plans,' said Mr Reischl. 'If we get the
acceptance we expect, there will be a snowball effect throughout the
country. We plan to open one or two stores a month next year.'
Mr Reischl confesses an enormous personal admiration for the traditional UK
supermarket groups.
On his visits, he takes pleasure in walking around the Sainsbury store
nearest to his hotel. He says he soon finds himself rapt in wonder at the
range and quality of food on offer.
'Every now and again we have tried to introduce up-market food to our German
stores, but the German housewife just won't buy filleted salmon,' he
laments. 'Look at the sandwiches you can buy in an English supermarket -
there is no way we could sell them at that kind of price to a German
consumer.'
He says poorer consumers get a raw deal in UK supermarkets, but philanthropy
 -bringing cheap food to the poor - plays only a limited role in his
thinking. More important is the profit motive.
Rewe, like a number of other German retailing groups to have started opening
discount stores in the UK, has its eye on the wide profit margins generated
by the big four UK supermarket groups.
UK supermarkets earn up to 7 per cent on sales which compares with 1 per
cent earned by the Rewe group. This gap in margins represents a wealth of
opportunity for the German discounters.

Speculation about the future of Malaysia Airlines (MAS), increased yesterday
with indications that the government is about to sell part of its remaining
stake in the airline in a deal worth up to MDollars 2bn (Dollars 770m).
Share dealings on the Kuala Lumpur stock market in both MAS and Malaysia
Helicopter Services (MHS), a small company specialising in support services
for the oil and gas industry, have been suspended.
It is widely believed that MHS will be used as the vehicle for the sale of a
substantial block of government held MAS shares.
After a partial privatisation in 1985, MAS is now 42 per cent owned by Bank
Negara, the Malaysian central bank, and 5 per cent each by the governments
in the east Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak.
The Brunei government holds another 10 per cent.
Whether Bank Negara will sell all its MAS shares is still not clear but
there are reports of a complex share swap. Analysts say the government is
anxious to capitalise on buoyant stock market activity to rid itself of its
holding in MAS.
The Malaysian state-controlled airline has been flying through financial
turbulence. It announced pre-tax profits for the six months ended September,
of MDollars 6.4m (Dollars 2.5m), a 96 per cent drop compared to the same
period last year.
Analysts say MAS is paying the price for an ambitious fleet expansion
programme launched three years ago just as the worldwide airline industry
was heading into recession.
In the course of its present five-year plan to 1996-97, MAS has orders for
72 aircraft costing a total of MDollars 10.6bn.
MHS is controlled by Mr Tajudin Ramli, a leading Malaysian businessmen. Mr
Tajudin's main listed company is Technology Resources Industries, a group
mainly involved in telecommunications.
Mr Tajudin recently announced that through MHS he was taking a 20 per cent
stake in World Airways, the US charter carrier.
While the Malaysian government appears anxious to make MAS more competitive
and less dependent on state funding, analysts feel that the state will
ensure it maintains considerable influence over any new fully privatised
entity.
One of Mr Tajudin's backers is believed to be Mr Daim Zaidnuddin, one of
Malaysia's richest businessmen.

South Korea's three main electronics groups - Samsung, Goldstar and Daewoo -
yesterday predicted significant increases in earnings and sales for 1993.
Samsung Electronics, the leading group, estimated net profits at Won150bn
(Dollars 185m), up 107 per cent. Sales will rise by 38 per cent to
Won8,100bn, it said.
The rapid profits expansion is primarily due to Samsung's semiconductor
division, which is the world's largest supplier of D-ram memory chips.
Strong global demand for D-ram chips and firm prices have boosted earnings
margins this year.
Goldstar estimates that net profits will grow by 126 per cent to Won60bn for
1993. Sales will increase by 16 per cent to Won4,400bn.
Growth was largely due to exports in consumer products, which have been
aided by the Korean won's depreciation against the Japanese yen and improved
its competitiveness against Japanese electronics manufacturers.
Daewoo Electronics expects that net profits will grow by 26.5 per cent to
Won21bn, while sales will rise by 19 per cent to Won2,050bn.
Daewoo has benefited from several popular products in the domestic market,
including improved versions of washing machines and tvs, its strongest
product lines.
South Korea will become the world's sixth largest motor vehicle producer
this year and is expected to become the fifth biggest within the next two or
three years.
Korea will produce 2.04m vehicles in 1993, overtaking Spain for sixth place,
according to the Kia Economic Research Institute, which is affiliated with
the country's second largest car manufacturer.
Production of motor vehicles will rise 17.8 per cent this year, the sharpest
increase among the the 10 main car producing countries, and exports will
grow by 37 per cent due to the Korean won's depreciation against the
Japanese yen.
Korea is likely to replace Canada as the world's fifth leading car producer
within the next several years.
'Most car factories in Canada are subsidiaries of foreign carmakers and its
domestic market is nearly full. Moreover, with the North American Free Trade
Agreement, some factories in Canada are expected to move to Mexico, where
the labour is cheaper.

The Taiwan government's offer of 18m shares of Chung Kuo Insurance was fully
subscribed, Reuter reports from Taipei.
Underwriter Chiao Tung Bank said the shares, equal to 15 per cent of the
company's stock, were priced at TDollars 54 a share and would raise TDollars
972m (USDollars 36m). More than 1m applications were received, with 9,000
applicants awarded 2,000 shares each, said Chiao Tung.
The Taiwan government eventually plans to give up its majority stake in the
group. Chung Kuo is one of three state-owned companies, along with Chiao
Tung and Farmers Bank of China, that applied to list last year but postponed
the move because of a weak stock market.
A domestic and overseas flotation of shares in China Steel is planned for
early next year.

The DBL Liquidating Trust, handling the disposal of what is left of the
defunct investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert, announced yesterday it was
selling New Street Capital, the successor firm to Drexel, to an Atlanta
investment group, and liquidating its portfolio of mostly junk bond
securities.
The Trust said it expected to realise more than Dollars 600m from the sale
of the Drexel assets, of which Dollars 209m will come from Green Capital,
the Atlanta firm buying the on-going business of New Street, a small
merchant bank with 24 staff. The remainder will come from the sale of New
Street's securities portfolio, which consists primarily of junk bonds.
The proceeds will be used to pay the holders of Drexel warrants, who will
receive a total of about Dollars 21m, and the investment bank's creditors. A
spokesman said it had yet to be decided how the funds from the sale of New
Street securities will be distributed among Drexel's creditors.
The disposals represent virtually the final chapter in the story of Drexel.
Under the junk bond king Mr Michael Milken, the firm became one of Wall
Street's premier investment banks during the 1980s, before the collapse of
the junk bond market dragged it into bankruptcy. Mr Milken served 22 months
in a federal prison for violations of securities laws.
After the deals, all that will remain will be a portfolio of illiquid
high-yield securities, estimated to be worth no more than Dollars 30m.

'information highway'

<TEXT>
US vice-president Mr Al Gore yesterday praised the formation of a
'cross-industry' collaborative group to accelerate development of
'information superhighways' - high-speed digital networks that will link
businesses and homes throughout the US.
Twentyeight companies, including AT&amp;T, Apple Computer, Citicorp, BellSouth,
Digital Equipment, IBM, Intel, Hewlett-Packard, and Cable Laboratories, the
research arm of the cable industry, yesterday announced the formation of the
Cross Industry Working Team (XIWT), to 'promote and accelerate the
deployment' of an advanced National Information Infrastructure (NII).
The NII is a major initiative supported by the Clinton administration and a
broad range of US industries.
'The NII will provide the foundation for a national transformation to an
information-based society, a key element for the US to sustain leadership in
the world economy,' said Mr Gore, a long-time proponent of information
superhighways.
'It is gratifying to see the XIWT bringing together many of the most
knowledgeable technologists in the country to help create a technical vision
for the NII.'
Mr Gore is to outline the administration's proposals for regulation of the
NII later this month and, with industry groups, is developing a new
'competition model' that will define how telecommunications, cable
television and other industry groups can participate in creating and
operating information superhighways.
The focus of the XIWT group, however, will be on technicalities that enable
different types of computers and networks to share information.
'The XIWT is an important complement to other policy-related efforts,' said
Robert Kahn, president of the Corporation for National Research Initiatives,
a non-profit-making, technology think-tank that organised the group.
'By fostering technologies that cross traditional industry boundaries, XIWT
hopes to contribute significantly to the development and deployment of a
world-class NII,' he said.
Among the activities planned by XIWT are development of common technological
approaches, pilot projects and technology forums.
'The XIWT is building a framework for a truly co-operative approach by
industry, academia and government to developing the information
infrastructure,' said George Fisher, chairman of the Council on
Competitiveness and chairman of Eastman Kodak.
Bellcore, the telecommunications industry-supported research laboratory,
yesterday announced that it will work separately with several companies to
develop and demonstrate prototype technologies for the NII.
Bellcore has created a 'Collaboratory on Information Infrastructure' to
develop prototype software that will make it practical for all people to
navigate these networks.
The companies involved in Bellcore's Collaboratory include television
broadcasters, computer manufacturers and the telephone industry.
Lanny Smoot, executive director of the Collaboratory, said it hoped to
contribute to the development of technologies that will make the NII
practical.
He said: 'The technologies we will explore could one day lead to the
availability of a vast array of services - electronic shopping malls,
collaborative electronic education and distance learning, access to
multimedia information, electronic libraries, multimedia messaging,
multimedia games, and interactive multimedia entertainment.'
Bellcore demonstrated several potential applications of the information
superhighway. These included systems that let people 'virtually' attend
meetings via desk-top computers; a computer-aided three-dimensional medical
imaging system; life-size video conferencing and a 'video visiting' system.

FT  14 DEC 93 / International Company News: Scandinavian tale of the red and
the black - Swedish banks needed government help to change colour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bailing out Nordbanken and Gota Bank has cost the Swedish taxpayer a cool
SKr81.6bn (Dollars 9.8bn) and the state has swallowed a further SKr110bn of
their bad loans, but their merger, announced last week, was still presented
as a success.
Two factors explain the paradox. First, the merger should mark the end of a
series of emergency operations mounted over the past year to keep Sweden's
banking system afloat. Second, there is general relief that the banking
crisis proved neither as expensive nor as prolonged as feared only a few
months ago.
'I think we have managed the crisis in the financial system rather well,'
said Mrs Anne Wibble, the tough finance minister not usually given to bouts
of public self-congratulation.
'It could really have been a disaster, but the problems now seem to be
becoming a thing of the past - touch wood.'
The marriage of Nordbanken and Gota Bank, which will be preceded by the
state's recapitalisation of Gota, is the last in a string of rescue acts
performed by the government since a spate of loan losses plunged Sweden's
banks into crisis last autumn. The two, which together will have a leading
24 per cent of Sweden's lending and deposit market, were the hardest hit.
Both had to be wholly taken over the by the state.
In both cases, direct aid injections were not enough to keep them in
business. The Bank Support Authority (BSA), established to manage the bank
crisis, set up so-called 'bad banks' to group the bulk of their bad loans.
These will stay in state hands and could take as long as 15 years to unwind.
Bad loans worth SKr67bn were lifted out of Nordbanken into a new company
called Securum - which required SKr35bn in state capital. A similar
operation at Gota Bank will create Retriva, holding Gota loans worth SKr43bn
and needing SKr7.3bn in capital.
In the meantime, the BSA has forked out SKr8bn to Swedbank and SKr2.5bn to
Foreningsbank, bringing to SKr92.1bn the total amount of state aid committed
to the banking system.
Some SKr60bn of this has a direct impact on the state budget, exacerbating a
deficit which this year runs to more than 13 per cent of GNP. But the
government's feeling of relief is understandable when what might have been
is taken into account.
In May, when the BSA was officially inaugurated, the banking system was
still in distress. An application for state aid was still outstanding from
Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, the leading commercial bank and a flagship of
the Wallenberg family empire, which feared it would fall below the 8 per
cent international capital adequacy standard.
Both Swedbank and Foreningsbank were also negotiating for further
substantial assistance.
But they have all since withdrawn their applications, as the 25 per cent
fall in the value of the Swedish krona and tumbling interest rates
transformed their earning power over the summer.
Instead, S-E Banken, Swedbank and Svenska Handelsbanken have raised SKr16bn
between them to rebuild their capital bases, mainly from share issues
launched in a fast-rising stock market.
Moreover, the government anticipates the final net cost of its bank rescue
operation may not be much more than SKr50bn, once it recoups the yet-to-be
determined price Nordbanken will pay for Gota Bank, the proceeds of the
planned privatisation of the merged bank and the sale of assets held by
Securum and Retriva.
The latter hold extensive property claims in Europe and beyond, making the
Swedish state one of Europe's leading real estate owners.
There is a lingering question over the Nordbanken-Gota merger. Instead of
using the bank crisis to engineer greater competition in the bank sector -
and bring in foreign participation, as Mrs Wibble earlier advocated - the
two worst-performing banks have had their balance sheets thoroughly
laundered by the state and been set up in a powerful market position.
Nordbanken is already back in profit and Gota is set to follow.
Criticism from rival banks has been muted, however. One Stockholm analyst
said there was wide acceptance that no one would have benefited from the
collapse of Nordbanken or Gota Bank, which could have triggered a general
loss of confidence in an already weakened banking system.
Given a continued downward trend in interest rates and the prospect of a
modest recovery in the economy next year, the banks appear set to leave the
dramas of the past year behind them. All should show a profit in 1994 - a
far cry from the red ink in 1992, when losses in the system amounted to
SKr50bn.
But there is little room for complacency. BSA officials estimate the banks
are still carrying problem loans worth as much as SKr100bn, leaving them
perilously exposed to any unexpected upturn in interest rates.
The government says it is keeping in place a blanket guarantee to honour
bank commitments issued at the beginning of the crisis - just in case of
more trouble.

FT  14 DEC 93 / International Company News: Laidlaw lays plans to sell stake
in ADT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Laidlaw is issuing an innovative debt instrument that opens an avenue for
the Ontario-based waste and transport services operator to dispose of its 24
per cent stake in ADT, the Bermuda-based security and vehicle auction group.
Laidlaw is ADT's largest single shareholder, but the two companies have had
a fickle relationship since Laidlaw's former chief executive Mr Michael
DeGroote showed his confidence in ADT chairman Mr Michael Ashcroft five
years ago by investing in his company.
But Laidlaw has recently signalled its wish to dispose of the ADT stake,
which it considers a non-core investment. Mr Ashcroft is due to step down as
a Laidlaw director after next month's annual meeting.
The terms of the Dollars 280m debenture issue give Laidlaw the choice of
converting the securities into ADT shares after five years, converting them
into Laidlaw stock, or redeeming them for cash.
In the meantime, debenture holders will share any increase in ADT's share
price to a maximum of Dollars 12.60, a 40 per cent premium on the existing
share price of Dollars 9. Any appreciation above Dollars 12.60 would be
exclusively for Laidlaw's benefit.
The crux of the issue's structure is that Laidlaw believes ADT shares are
presently under-valued. It is confident that ADT will benefit from a
refinancing package, and from bank covenants which preclude it moving away
from its core businesses of security services and vehicle auctions.
'When they do appreciate, we want to share in that appreciation,' an
official said yesterday. Laidlaw presently values ADT on its books at
Dollars 11.69 a share.
The issue does not prevent Laidlaw, however, from selling its ADT shares
before the conversion date, if it receives an attractive offer.
The debentures, which are underwritten by a group of Canadian securities
dealers, will be issued in two tranches, one denominated in Canadian dollars
carrying an interest rate of 6.75 per cent, and the other in US dollars with
a coupon of 6 per cent.
The maximum yield, if ADT shares climb to Dollars 12.60, would be 12 per
cent a year.

FT  14 DEC 93 / International Company News: Hungary mounts rescue of 10
commercial banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Hungarian government yesterday unveiled a two-stage Dollars 1.4bn
bailout for 10 commercial banks whose capital has been wiped out by loan
losses.
In the first stage later this month the state will inject Ft110bn (Dollars
1.1bn) to restore solvency to Magyar Hitel Bank, Kereskedelmi Bank and
Budapest Bank, the country's three largest commercial banks, and five
smaller financial institutions.
On average the banks have negative capital equivalent to about 15 per cent
of risk-weighted assets and the infusion is needed just to raise the banks'
capital adequacy to zero.
The rescue is necessary before the closing of the 1993 accounts to rebuild
confidence in the troubled banks after a World Bank aide-memoire declared
them 'technically insolvent'.
A further recapitalisation in the first half of 1994 will include two more
banks and raise capital adequacy ratios to at least 4 per cent at a cost of
an estimated Ft30bn.
The government hopes that its support will speed privatisation of the banks
and that the contribution of new investors will provide the final boost to
take capital adequacy ratios to the 8 per cent standard set by the
Basle-based Bank for International Settlements.
Hitel Bank has the largest call on the government's funds with a capital
need of over Ft50bn. It is the largest commercial bank and main lender to
the engineering companies which have suffered most from the collapse of
Comecon markets.
The latest commitment comes on top of the state's assumption of bad debts
from the banking sector at a cost of Ft100bn in 1992 and a similar Ft40bn
exchange earlier this year.
The government is spreading the burden by effecting the recapitalisation
through 20-year bonds. Yesterday's announcement nevertheless takes to nearly
Ft300bn the total cost of Hungary's efforts to shore up its banking system.
In return, the finance ministry is exacting a heavy price in terms of lost
independence for banks participating in the government's 'consolidation'
scheme.
The capital increase will dilute the shareholdings of existing investors and
the ministry has said it intends to demand a controlling golden share in any
bank in which its stake does not reach 75 per cent.

Pirelli, the Italian cables and tyres group, is to float up to half its
Australian cables subsidiary to raise cash in the recession.
The company will sell up to 50 per cent of Sydney-based Pirelli Cables
Australia, which employs about 600 people and expects sales of ADollars 135m
(USDollars 88.2m) this year.
Pirelli, the world's second biggest cables maker, is joining a growing queue
of companies taking advantage of local circumstances to float their
Australian operations. The company did not indicate precise timing, but said
the deal would take place within the next six months.
Pirelli justified the decision, in which it is being advised by Baring
Brothers, under a strategy to establish a local profile for the operation
and provide access to domestic sources of equity.
The Asian telecommunications market is growing extremely fast, and an
Australian listing could help to raise additional funds.

share plan

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister, yesterday gave details of
the golden share to be retained in Elf Aquitaine, the oil group which is due
to be privatised early next year.
According to Mr Alphandery, the terms of the golden share will require
government approval for other investors, either acting individually or in
concert, to raise their shareholdings in Elf above the limits of 10 per
cent, 20 per cent and 33.3 per cent.
The golden share, which will be of unlimited duration, will also give the
French government a veto over asset sales if it feels they threaten the
national interest. This veto will apply to asset sales in Elf Aquitaine
Production, Elf Antar France, Elf Congo and Elf Gabon, an official said.
In addition to the golden share, the French government will retain a holding
of between 10 and 15 per cent in Elf through Erap, the state holding
company, which currently controls 50.8 per cent of the oil group's shares.
The precise level will be set at the time of privatisation, which Mr
Alphandery said would take place in the first few months of next year.
Mr Alphandery said that the measures would 'assure the protection of
national interests' following Elf's privatisation. 'With the golden share on
the one hand and the state's stake on the other, we have found the right
balance,' he said.
Oil industry analysts said yesterday's announcement reflected the
sensitivity of the privatisation of Elf Aquitaine, France's largest
industrial group. 'The golden share is no surprise,' said one analyst, 'but
the government is clearly retaining a maximum of control under the terms of
the privatisation law.'
The sale of the stake in Elf Aquitaine will be the first privatisation to
take place next year. It will be the largest so far in the government's
programme to sell 21 publicly-owned groups.

FT  14 DEC 93 / International Company News: German banks put reticence aside
 -An industry less defensive after record profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just as many rich Germans lead a modest lifestyle, German banks do not like
to flaunt their prosperity. But in the past few weeks, the big banks have
put reticence aside and told the world how they are making more money this
year than they have ever done before, despite the deep recession afflicting
their customers.
One big bank after another has reported a surge in profits for the 10 months
to October, even after making provisions for mounting bad and doubtful
debts.
The growth was most pronounced at Commerzbank, the third-largest of the big
banks, where operating profits after provisions rose by 52 per cent. But it
was still impressive at Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, where profits rose
by 11 per cent and 16 per cent respectively. At Bayerische Vereinsbank and
Hypo-Bank, the two big Bavarian banks, profits grew at a spectacular 28 per
cent and 27 per cent respectively.
The main impetus for the growth came from buoyant conditions in world
securities and currencies markets, which helped the banks make record
trading profits on their own account and generate healthy commission from
dealing on their clients' behalf.
On top of that came an increase in profits from mainstream lending business.
Bank lending was still growing at a six-month annualised rate of a robust
9.2 per cent in October, despite the depth of the recession. Mortgage
business is growing at a still higher rate as demand for loans has been
stimulated by extremely low long-term interest rates.
Offsetting the growth in profits was a sharp deterioration in domestic
credit quality - all of the big banks with the exception of Commerzbank
reported substantial increases in provisions to cover questionable risks. At
Deutsche Bank, provisions surged 54 per cent to DM2.5bn (Dollars 1.47bn) in
the first 10 months of the year and are likely to reach DM3bn for the year
as a whole.
On balance, even the full flexibility of German accounting - which gives
managers considerable scope to deploy 'hidden reserves' to keep reported
earnings at whatever level suits them - could not serve to hide the fact
that over all German banks' profits were embarrassingly good.
Coming at the trough of the German recession and a time of misery for the
growing ranks of the country's unemployed, the figures have put the banks'
chief executives on the defensive.
'Are we not allowed to do well, just because other sectors of the economy
are doing badly?' asked Mr Jurgen Sarrazin, chief executive of the Dresdner
Bank. 'On the contrary: now is the right time for banks to show their
strength, as a frail financial sector would push the economy deeper into
crisis.'
His cry was taken up by Mr Hilmar Kopper at the Deutsche Bank, who was not
ashamed to spell out that Deutsche's DM4.2bn profits were bigger than those
of the next five banks put together. Mr Kopper said that German banks made
less money than their international rivals, and should not be ashamed of
making money. 'I'm always expecting letters of congratulation,' he quipped,
'but they never seem to arrive.'
Resentment about the economic might of the banks is as least as old as the
Federal Republic of Germany. Ever since Mr Hermann Josef Abs, the legendary
former chief executive of the Deutsche Bank, rebuilt the commercial banking
sector in the aftermath of the second world war, there has been a
none-too-subdued debate about the 'power of the banks'.
Critics of the banks, the best known of whom is Mr Otto Lambsdorff,
economics spokesman of the Free Democrats (FDP), believe the banks enjoy an
over-mighty concentration of economic power that is detrimental to consumers
and competition.
That power, critics allege, stems from the banks' extensive holdings in
German industry, their seats on the supervisory boards of big German
companies and their ability to vote their clients' investment portfolios to
further their own commercial ends - not to mention their ability to make
vast profits amid recession.
'The power of the banks must be broken apart,' Mr Lambsdorff said last week
ahead of a hearing in Bonn at which politicians met to consider whether
banks should be subject to new legal constraints on their activities. 'The
power of the banks damages Standort Deutschland - Germany as a place to do
business,' said Mr Hans Martin Bury, an MP for the opposition Social
Democrats.
Bankers brush off the the criticism with more annoyance than usual - partly
as they know from the experience of recent months that power does not come
without responsibility. During good times it may be a fine thing to own big
stakes in dozens of big industrial companies, but amid a recession the
stakes become a headache.
For example, today's meeting of the Deutsche Bank board will doubtless focus
on problems at Metallgesellschaft, the troubled metals to mining
conglomerate in which Deutsche owns an 11 per cent stake. At other board
meetings the troubles of Daimler-Benz (28 per cent owned by the bank) or the
ailing Maho machine tools company (18 per cent) will have dominated the
agenda.
A second reason for annoyance is that bank profits cannot be sustained at
current levels, as Mr Kopper at Deutsche Bank said last week. He explained
that much of the bank's growth in profits in the first 10 months was due to
buoyant foreign operations, where profits climbed 40 per cent. In Germany,
there was no escaping the recession, and profits at the parent bank actually
fell by 9 per cent.
Where Deutsche leads, others tend to follow, and it seems unlikely that the
banks' immunity to the downturn will last much longer. Bad debts will
continue to climb and securities markets - back to more normal levels of
activity - will not provide a cushion of substantial trading profits. In a
year's time Mr Sarrazin of the Dresdner Bank will look back with nostalgia
on the days when he had to be defensive about making record profits.

rises

<TEXT>
Varde Bank, Denmark's 10th largest bank with assets of about DKr11bn
(Dollars 1.65bn), is being broken up and the healthy business will be
acquired by Sydbank Sonderjylland, the South Jutland banking group, Sydbank
said yesterday.
Varde Bank, which serves the region of the West Jutland port of Esbjerg,
underwent a financial reconstruction a year ago, when the central bank and
the larger commercial banks put up guarantees to enable it to stay in
business. But fresh losses this autumn sent the bank's capital adequacy
ratio under the Danish legal minimum ratio of 9 per cent and negotiations to
find a solution to the bank's problem have been continuing for several
weeks.
The final arrangements for winding up the bank will be announced today. An
option being considered, according to Varde Bank, is the creation of an
asset management company, or 'bad bank', to take over the biggest of the bad
debts, which are linked to property engagements.
Denmark operates a deposit insurance system to prevent losses for deposits
of up to DKr240,000.

FT  14 DEC 93 / International Company News: Bombardier sees loss on Channel
project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Bombardier, the diversified Canadian transport group which is making the
Channel tunnel shuttle, expects to make a loss on its contract to supply
railcars, but hopes that the technical prestige of the contract will bring
future compensation and orders.
Mr Michel Lord, a vice-president of Bombardier, said that his company would
not have signed its CDollars 820m (USDollars 621.2m) contract in 1989 to
supply 254 railcars if it had known there was going to be an eventual
CDollars 450m cost over-run.
Bombardier said the over-run was almost entirely due to design changes
imposed on contractors by French and British government safety inspectors,
such as a 10cm widening of some doors, and demanded compensation.
In a deal reached earlier this month with Eurotunnel, the operator of the
undersea rail link, Bombardier settled for CDollars 157m in cash and up to
25m shares in Eurotunnel.
Bombardier, which in accepting the shares has become Eurotunnel's largest
single shareholder, hopes that in other contracts it would be able to recoup
losses it had made on the Channel tunnel project and find a use for the
technical lessons it had learnt.

Due to the introduction of the Single Market, EC countries are currently
changing to a new system of compiling trade statistics. All trade
figures are seasonally adjusted, except for the Italian series and the
German current account. Imports can be derived by subtracting the
visible trade balance from exports. Export and import data are
calculated on the FOB (free on board) basis, except for German and
Italian imports which use the CIF method (including carriage, insurance
and freight charges). German data up to and including June 1990, shown
in italics, refer to the former West Germany. The nominal effective
exchange rates are period averages of Bank of England trade-weighted
indies. Data supplied by Datastream and WEFA from national government
and central bank sources.

FT  14 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Tiphook delays interim statement
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tiphook, the container leasing and transport rental group, said its
half-year results would be announced 'rather later' than usual because of
talks about the possible sale of its container division to Transamerica, the
US financial services and leasing group.
The UK group normally reports its mid-term results in December.
Tiphook's operating container fleet in November stood at 491,633 20 ft
equivalent units, down 3,975 on October's level.
November's average utilisation was 81.98 per cent, against 82.31 per cent.
The European truck trailer fleet stood at 25,192, up 127 on October. Average
utilisation was 83 per cent, against 78.3 per cent.

FT  14 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Radio Clyde advances to Pounds 3m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Radio Clyde, the USM-quoted broadcaster, turned in a near-threefold increase
in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.09m to Pounds 3.03m for the year to
end-September.
The improvement was achieved on turnover up 12 per cent to Pounds 14.6m
(Pounds 13m), and included exceptional credits amounting to Pounds 618,000 -
against Pounds 738,000 costs last time. Comparisons were restated in
accordance with FRS 3.
The bulk of the exceptional credit arose from the disposal of about 50 per
cent of the company's 28.6 per cent investment in Satellite Media Services.
An increased final dividend of 6p is proposed, for a total of 9.5p (8.5p).
The distribution comes from earnings per share of 24.7p against 5p -
restated under FRS 3 from 13.2p.
The company intends to change its name to Scottish Radio Holdings.

FT  14 DEC 93 / UK Company News: London Electricity jumps 34%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Electricity's airport distribution network, bought from BAA in March,
helped the company lift pre-tax profits by 34 per cent to Pounds 69.9m in
the six months to end-September.
The airports arm made an operating profit of Pounds 5.3m in the half and the
company expects a contribution of about double that for the full year.
Mr Roger Urwin, chief executive, said the business was a long term
investment which would make increasing contributions to earnings
London Electricity was also helped in the half year by its decision to
withdraw from retailing. Losses in the operation were eliminated, whereas in
first half of last year they were Pounds 4.6m.
The company's aim of reducing its payroll by 2 to 3 per cent a year was
exceeded in the first half when staffing fell by 452 to 5,212, with the help
of the retail disposals. Reductions in the core business amounted to 151.
The company has cut 1,500 jobs since privatisation, 1,000 of them in the
core businesses.
COMMENT
The 32 per cent dividend increase is rather more spectacular than it may
seem. Assuming the company sticks to its line of paying two thirds of the
full year payment in the second half then the total of 22.2p will be only
fractionally higher than the market was already expecting. Nonetheless,
there was enough in yesterday's results to justify the recent rise in the
share price. They demonstrate the value of getting out of retailing at a
time when some other regional companies are struggling to justify
persevering in it. The move into the airports company, the most significant
acquisition by any rec, also looks astute as it will provide growing
earnings in a safe, if dull, business which London is well qualified to run.
At group level, yesterday's managerial appointments also represent a
significant strengthening of the board. The shares are trading on a
prospective yield of about 4.3 per cent. That seems about right this side of
the regulator's review of the recs' distribution businesses. The market
remains nervous about London's relatively high cost base and its task is to
persuade the regulator that the costs are entirely a result of operating in
the capital.

FT  14 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Dutch group may snooker European Leisure
plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Dutch investment company with a large stake in European Leisure, the
debt-laden snooker hall and discotheque operator, is opposing the board's
restructuring plans as 'evidently unfair.'
Van Heyst Investments, which has 11 per cent of European Leisure's
preference shares and 3 per cent of the ordinary equity, has written to 19
other preference shareholders urging them to vote against the proposals. Mr
Henk van Heyst, director of Van Heyst Investments, believes that the 20
groups represent 95 per cent of the preference shares. He said yesterday
that so far he had had no response.
European Leisure needs 75 per cent of the votes cast at its meeting in
Dublin next Tuesday for the restructuring to proceed. Under the proposals
the banks could end up with as much as 71 per cent of the company in four
years' time.
Mr van Heyst accepts that the banks will get the biggest stake, but believes
the preference shareholders, whose claim on the current equity is about 80
per cent, are getting a raw deal. They would, he said, end up with only 27
per cent of the equity not held by the banks, compared with 63 per cent for
the ordinary shareholders.
Separately, Mr Maurice Cresswell, a private investor with 1m ordinary
shares, has written to Mr Clive Bastin, European Leisure chairman,
criticising the group's proposals as 'utterly astounding and totally
unacceptable.'
Mr Ian Rock, European Leisure chief executive, said yesterday that the group
had sought to balance within the restructuring proposals the interests of
all parties. 'We are hopeful of persuading all classes of shareholder to
vote in favour.'

FT  14 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Standard Life new premiums top Pounds 2bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Standard Life, one of the UK's largest insurance companies, said yesterday
that its new premium income in the UK over the year to November 15 had
increased by 20 per cent to Pounds 2.08bn.
It said that continuing increases in single premium investment had more than
compensated for the trend away from annual premium business.
In both annual and single premium products, however, the amount of new
business in individual pensions was lower than in the previous 12 months.
New business from annual premium individual pensions was down 4 per cent to
Pounds 66m, while from single premium personal pensions it was down 9 per
cent to Pounds 648m.
Individual pensions were the only single-premium products to record a fall
in new business.
Standard Life said that the personal pensions market as a whole had been
affected by the recession, with people giving priority to meeting their
day-to-day needs rather than longer-term saving.
There was a sharp increase in new investments into Standard Life's
investment bonds, which more than doubled over the year from Pounds 190m to
Pounds 467m.
Standard Life attributed this to the return of confi-dence to the stock
market as well as its own investment record.
The company said that 65 per cent of its new business came from financial
inter-mediaries, with the rest coming from tied agents and the small direct
sales force it is building up now that its 'tie' with the Halifax Building
Society, the UK's largest, is to be broken.
Including business in Canada and the Republic of Ireland, Standard Life's
new premium income rose 15 per cent to Pounds 2.8bn.

FT  14 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Hays buys agency for Pounds 5.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hays, the business services group, has reaffirmed its faith in the reviving
recruitment market by paying Pounds 5.1m for Modus Holdings, a specialist
agency which provides information technology staff.
Modus, which has two branches north of London, provides computer systems,
programming and operating staff. The management will stay with the business.
Hays said Modus would fit well with its Accountancy Personnel business,
which has 120 branches providing accountancy placements and is part of the
group's personnel services division. Client contact within both businesses
was with finance directors and there would be opportunities to cross-market
client databases and expand Modus through the Hays personnel network.
Hays' operating profits from personnel plunged from Pounds 19m in 1990 to
just Pounds 4.8m two years later, but the division showed a 40 per cent
recovery to Pounds 6.7m in the year to June 30.
Mr Ronnie Frost, executive chairman, said the recruitment market was
continuing to make steady progress. 'Every single week is better than the
last on temps, and permanent staff are beginning to show.' Modus made
operating profits of Pounds 950,000 on sales of Pounds 13.9m in the 11
months to December 10. Hays has acquired the share capital for Pounds 2.7m
and assumed debt of Pounds 2.4m.
The consideration consists of Pounds 2.04m in loan notes, Pounds 540,000 in
cash and Pounds 120,000 through issuing 45,045 Hays shares.

FT  14 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Booth Industries closes division
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Booth Industries Group is pulling out of structural steelwork with the loss
of two thirds of its workforce following continued weakness in the company's
markets.
However, Mr Robin Booth, managing director, said the move was not final and
the company would re-enter the market when conditions allowed. He added that
the decision would not take effect for three months when the present order
book ran out.
The announcement accompanied interim results showing further pre-tax losses
of Pounds 377,970 (Pounds 110,043 profits) after a fall into the red in the
second half of the previous year. Turnover fell from Pounds 12m to Pounds
7.97m.
Full provision for the withdrawal would be made in the full year accounts,
amounting to the greater part of retained reserves. The company said these
would be replaced by the sale of tangible assets 'which had been held for
many years'.
Mr Booth declined to identify the assets but thought there would be no
problem in realising sufficient funds to cover the provisions and leave cash
for expansion.
The Bolton-based company will be left with its provision of high
specification doors and fire engineering equipment.
The company blamed the steelwork side for the losses in the six months to
September 30. Mr James Booth, chairman, said the group had been restricted
to working on contracts in an 'intensely competitive domestic market'.
Losses per share came out at 9.45p (1.84p earnings). The interim dividend is
passed (0.7p).

FT  14 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Coda plans listing in new year - Float
proceeds of up to Pounds 25m will be used for R&amp;D and expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coda, the Harrogate-based accountancy software designer for standard,
mid-range computers, is to seek a main market listing early next year to
raise up to Pounds 25m.
The bulk of the money will go towards speeding up research and development
of new products, and expansion in the US, EU and Asia-Pacific.
Coda's latest results, published yesterday, showed pre-tax profits of Pounds
3.75m at the October year-end, a rise of 16 per cent. Turnover rose 31 per
cent to Pounds 23.5m.
Mr Rodney Potts, chairman, who founded Coda with two friends in 1979, said
expansion so far had been financed by growth. NatWest Markets, the sole
outside investor - but with only 7 per cent of equity - was not pressing for
an exit.
However, flotation will also help fund an employee share ownership programme
to give a stake in the business to as many of Coda's 300 staff who want it.
Since the company trades on selling accountancy packages designed by
accountants to accountants, Mr Potts sees wider share ownership as an
important potential motivator in a competitive market.
County NatWest Ventures bought in eight years ago, when Mr Potts and Mr
Chris Lennox, technical director, needed to buy out their co-founder, who
wanted to leave.
Coda concentrates exclusively on accounting software, functioning
independently of hardware manufacturers but using open systems which can run
on IBM, Digital or Hewlett-Packard computers, as well as interfacing with
popular relational databases.
Its integrated accounting system runs in more than 1,000 companies in 40
countries. Customers include P&amp;O, Reckitt &amp; Colman, TDK, Caterpillar, Sears,
Nedlloyd and Superdrug.
Business is also growing for accountancy software run on personal computers
linked to mainframes or joined into local area networks.
This accounted for nearly Pounds 1.5m of last year's sales.
North American sales, where Coda has eight offices, were Dollars 16m (Pounds
10.7m), ahead more than 40 per cent. Its Asia-Pacific headquarters is in
Singapore with branches in Australia, Hong Kong and New Zealand.
The remaining nine offices are in Europe, where technical obstacles have
included different accounting standards and tax regimes, automatic language
translation and the need for bigger entry fields in Italy to get all the
figures in.
As part of going public, Mr Colin Gaskell, chief executive of 600 Group, and
Mr David Eggleton, until 1990 head of corporate information systems for BP,
have joined Coda as non-executive directors.

FT  14 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Century Inns makes Pounds 4.7m in first
year of trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Century Inns, the pubs operator, recorded pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.7m on
turnover of Pounds 19.8m for the 12 months to end-September, its first full
year of trading.
The outcome compared with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.2m (Pounds 2.1m
before exceptional start-up costs) in the previous 10-month period, on
turnover of Pounds 13.1m.
Operating profit for the period under review was Pounds 8m, compared with
Pounds 4.4m (excluding exceptional items amounting to Pounds 900,000) for
the preceding 10 months.
The company said its performance in its first full year reflected not only
the annualisation effect of purchases during 1992, but also substantial real
growth in earnings.
Mr Alistair Arkley, chief executive, predicted 'reasonable growth' in
pre-tax profits in the current year.
Century, which now has 301 public houses in Yorkshire and north-east
England, was founded in November 1991 by Mr Arkley, former managing director
of Brent Walker Brewing and Trading, and two senior colleagues.
The three, who between them put in about Pounds 250,000, raised more than
Pounds 60m for their management buy-in from Schroder Ventures, Mezzanine
Management and National Westminster Bank.
The business was launched with the purchase of 185 pubs from Bass. Century,
with headquarters in Billingham, Cleveland, now has assets of Pounds 52.6m.
Mr Arkley said he believed the company could grow to 500 pubs within its
existing management structure.
The anticipated sale of Scottish &amp; Newcastle pubs, following its purchase of
GrandMet's Chef &amp; Brewer chain, may give Century a chance to grow, he said.
Century Inns would this year start laying the administrative groundwork for
flotation, he added.

FT  14 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Rebel holders threaten Fife
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rebel shareholders at Fife Indmar yesterday threatened to force a financial
crisis at the Scottish engineering and distribution company if they failed
to win control at an extraordinary meeting this week.
Mr Charles McDonald, a non-executive director and rebel leader, said he
would cash in Pounds 300,000 of loan notes and probably sell his 8.5 per
cent stake - the largest non-institutional holding - if moves to oust the
board were voted down.
'They'll have a lot of shares coming on to the market. The price could
collapse,' he said yesterday.
The warning followed allegations of costly acquisitions and poor financial
management at Fife.
Mr Gavin Hepburn, chairman, has dismissed the claims and accused the rebels
of publishing inaccurate information about the group.
He also held out the prospect of a threefold increase in the final dividend
to 2p if the current board remained in control.
The rebels yesterday pledged to match Mr Hepburn's offer and said they would
invest an extra Pounds 1m in the company.
Mr McDonald said he had the backing of more than 20 per cent of the private
investors, although institutions, which control a total of 45.7 per cent of
the shares, have not yet signalled their intentions.

FT  14 DEC 93 / UK Company News: BTG asks SE to investigate shares rise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Business Technology Group has asked the Stock Exchange to investigate the
'substantial' increase in its share price following the completion of the
pre-marketing of a placing and open offer last week.
The office equipment supplier is raising an unspecified amount at 12 3/4 p a
share for working capital and to help pay for an acquisition.
BTG said that adverse trading in the third quarter of 1993 had resulted in
significant losses, increasing pressure on finances and requiring an
immediate injection of equity.
It added that it was in discussions which might lead to a significant
acquisition.
Yesterday the shares slipped 1 1/2 p to 13p.

FT  14 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Richards deficit cut to Pounds 71,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After a fourth quarter which turned out to be 'more difficult than expected'
Richards, the Aberdeen-based textile company, ended the year to September 30
with a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 71,000.
The outcome, which compared with a loss of Pounds 1.99m last year, was
struck on turnover down from Pounds 71.9m to Pounds 67.8m. Of this,
acquisitions accounted for Pounds 1.75m and discontinued operations for
Pounds 144,000 (Pounds 3.35m).
Positive aspects to the results were a Pounds 362,000 gain from the sale of
properties, the release of a 1992 provision amounting to Pounds 663,000
relating to the withdrawal from linen manufacture and a bomb compensation
claim, and a Pounds 50,000 profits contribution from Toweropen, acquired in
August.
The directors said that Kyle Knitwear had again suffered a significant loss
and this company was now up for sale.
After a tax credit of Pounds 201,000 (Pounds 750,000) earnings per share
came out at 0.54p (5.33p losses). The final dividend is cut to 1.93p (2.93p)
making a total for the year of 3p (4p).

20,550
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Losses at Mining &amp; Allied Supplies, a distributor of precision bearings and
power transmission products, were cut from Pounds 189,413 to Pounds 20,550
pre-tax over the 12 months ended September 30.
The deficit took account of a Pounds 663,812 provision for discontinued
activities to conform with FRS 3 and a Pounds 69,577 rise in interest
charges to Pounds 572,185. The latter mainly reflected additional funding
for the purchase of Richard Hough Bearings in June.
Turnover of Pounds 24.6m (Pounds 18.7m) included an acquisition contribution
of Pounds 1.17m.
Operating expenses accounted for Pounds 6.34m (Pounds 4.58m).
The dividend for the year is being stepped up from 0.5p to 0.75p as a
measure of confidence and group prospects.
Losses per share widened from 0.3p to 0.5p.
The directors are proposing a name change to Bearing Power International.

FT  14 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Rise to Pounds 7m at Hardys &amp; Hansons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two new pubs and the refurbishment of some older establishments helped
Hardys &amp; Hansons, the Nottingham-based brewer, lift pre-tax profits from
Pounds 6.87m to Pounds 7.04m in the year to October 1.
'We are not beginning to see a recovery here. We could not say the recession
is beginning to end,' said Mr Richard Hanson, chairman and managing
director.
Turnover rose to Pounds 31.7m (Pounds 30.3m). Mr Hanson said prices had
increased in line with the rest of the industry and, stripping out the new
premises, volumes were stable.
He said cost pressure had pushed prices up by 4p in September bringing the
cost of a pint of bitter to Pounds 1.14p in the company's managed pubs.
The company launched three new canned beers in July. Yesterday's figures
benefited from these for only three months.
A 9.8 per cent increase in trading profits to Pounds 6.32m (Pounds 5.76m)
was not fully reflected at the pre-tax level. Income from interest and
dividends fell from Pounds 962,000 to Pounds 638,000 as rates fell and funds
were invested in the company's estate.
Hardys now has 255 pubs in the east Midlands with about one third directly
managed and the remainder tenanted.
About 100 pubs are based in Nottinghamshire, with the same number in
Derbyshire.
The board is recommending an increased final dividend of 5.5p giving a
higher total for the year of 8.5p (7.9p).
Earnings per share rose to 18.935p (18.647p).

FT  14 DEC 93 / UK Company News: SB wins UK approval for anti-viral drug
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SmithKline Beecham has launched itself into a new and potentially lucrative
healthcare field with the approval in the UK of famciclovir, its anti-viral
drug.
It has been granted a licence from the UK Department of Health to market the
compound under the trade name Famvir for the treatment of herpes zoster,
better known as shingles.
It will allow SmithKline Beecham to challenge the effective monopoly in
anti-viral drugs held by Wellcome, its UK rival.
The business is currently dominated by Zovirax, Wellcome's best selling drug
with annual sales of more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m).
Famvir would go on sale to doctors 'early next year', said SmithKline.
The company would not comment on the pricing of the drug, which has to
secure approvals in all the world's main drug markets to ensure its ultimate
success.
It has submitted famciclovir in more than 20 countries, with US approval
likely next year. About 40 per cent of world sales of Zovirax are in the US;
the UK accounts for about 5 per cent.
SmithKline Beecham is also seeking approval for the use of famciclovir in
treating conditions other than shingles.
Less than one third of Zovirax sales are used in the treatment of shingles;
the rest goes on herpes of the face and trunk, genital herpes and chicken
pox.
Although Zovirax has effectively had a monopoly in the anti-viral market,
this is about to change.
Patents on the drug begin to expire this year, although they remain in force
until 1997 in the US, which accountsfor almost half of total sales.
Wellcome has already launched over-the-counter versions of Zovirax as part
of an attempt to forestall the effect of competition from generic
competition.
Glaxo and Warner-Lambert of the US yesterday confirmed that they have signed
agreements under which they will form a joint venture to develop and market
over-the-counter versions of Glaxo's prescription drugs.
The joint venture will initially concentrate on developing Zantac, the ulcer
treatment that has been the world's best selling drug for several years, for
the non-prescription market.
OTC Zantac would probably be sold as a treatment for stomach upsets and will
be submitted in 1995 to the US Food and Drug Administration for approval.

FT  14 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Racecourse stakes comes under orders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The race to find a new owner for Epsom racecourse, home of the Derby, began
in earnest yesterday as Lazard Brothers, the merchant bank, made available
an information memorandum for potential bidders.
Known to be in the running are Racecourse Holdings Trust, a subsidiary of
the Jockey Club, and the Racehorse Owners Association.
Epsom is being sold along, with Kempton Park and Sandown Park, by the
Horserace Betting Levy Board, the statutory body that acquired the courses
more than 20 years ago in order to preserve them from possible property
developers. The courses comprise almost 1,000 acres within the M25.
Estimates of their value range between Pounds 20m and Pounds 50m.
Mr Rodney Brack, chief executive of the Levy Board, said that 20 potential
buyers had been listed so far, with a small proportion from overseas.
The Levy Board will retain the freehold of the courses, and provide the
purchaser with long leases subject to covenants guaranteeing the future of
racing. 'If a purchaser fails to honour the covenants, the Levy Board will
be in a position to take action,' said Mr Brack.
United Racecourses, the Levy Board subsidiary that runs the three courses,
last year had turnover of Pounds 9.9m, of which Pounds 2.8m came from
non-racing activities.
Racecourse Holdings Trust already owns nine courses, including Cheltenham
and Newmarket, and ploughs all its profits back into racing.
The Racehorse Owners Association, which has 4,500 members, in October set up
a committee to investigate the possibility of buying the courses. The
committee includes Mr David Sieff of Marks and Spencer and Sir Eric Parker,
former chief executive of Trafalgar House.

FT  14 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Calderburn paying up to Pounds 10m for
specialist supplier
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Calderburn, the office furniture group, has paid an initial Pounds 6.25m for
SBFI, a specialist supplier of dealing desks to financial institutions.
Initial consideration comprises a mixture of new shares, cash and loan
notes.
In addition, deferred consideration of up to Pounds 4.5m is linked to profit
targets.
In the three years ended March 31 turnover of SBFI had risen from Pounds
10.2m to Pounds 14.6m and pre-tax profits from Pounds 143,000 to Pounds
1.21m.
Calderburn directors believed that the acquisition would significantly
improve the group's growth prospects and enhance earnings per share.
They anticipated that group pre-tax profits for 1993 would be in the order
of Pounds 2m (Pounds 2.83m) after charging non-recurring costs of about
Pounds 400,000.
It was their intention to recommend a maintained total dividend of 7.7p via
the payment of a 4.9p final.
SBFI's markets take in the UK, Europe and east Asia.
Shareholders' approval will be sought for the acquisition at an
extraordinary meeting convened for December 29.

FT  14 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Yorkshire-Tyne Tees set to contain deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, the lossmaking ITV company, rose by 2p to
163p despite the delay in announcing year-end results and the decision to
pass the final dividend.
The company also confirmed yesterday that pre-tax losses for the year to
September 'will not exceed Pounds 9.5m'.
The share price was almost certainly held up by the fact that the forecast
losses were not as large as some analysts feared, and by the interest from
London Weekend Television in an agreed takeover.
Mr Ward Thomas, chairman of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees - a company in which
Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake - conceded
yesterday that 'everybody is talking to everybody', and that included LWT
and Yorkshire.
In fact, the Yorkshire board on Friday gave LWT permission to begin due
diligence on an agreed bid.
LWT, which is the subject of a hostile takeover bid from Granada - the
television, rental and leisure group - is expected to publish a defence
document this week.
The company will outline the 'quartet' theory in the hope of finding an
alternative to being swallowed up by Granada.
Under the proposals, LWT would take over Yorkshire and Anglia Television
would take over Tyne Tees. Under proposed government ownership changes one
company can own two licences but no more.
The hope would be that eventually further liberalisation of ownership rules
will come, allowing a grand alliance of LWT, Yorkshire, Anglia and Tyne
Tees. The shares of those involved changed remarkably little yesterday, with
LWT down 4p at 588p and Anglia down 2p at 418p.
Mr Thomas said yesterday he thought the quartet theory 'makes a lot of
sense' in that it would balance the growing dominance of Carlton
Communications, which has made an agreed bid for Central, valuing the
Midlands ITV company at more than Pounds 800m.
Mr Gerry Robinson, chief executive of Granada, insists that the offer for
LWT - worth more than Pounds 600m  - is the 'cleanest and clearest' and
above all is 'available now'. All the signs are that Granada is considering
a modest 'sweetener' to clinch the LWT deal.
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees promised yesterday to announce audited year-end results
by the end of January. The delay came because negotiations with customers on
the repayment of oversold advertising time had not been completed.
The final pre-tax loss is likely to be about Pounds 8.5m rather than the
contingent figure of Pounds 9.5m, and it is likely that most of the problems
of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees have been dealt with in the 1992-93 accounts, with
hopes of a return to profit in the current financial year.
Industry speculation suggests that Yorkshire-Tyne Tees has had disappointing
advertising sales in November and December.

FT  14 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Losses approaching Pounds 15m expected from
Chrysalis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chrysalis, the music and entertainment group, is expected to announce on
Friday that it incurred losses of nearly Pounds 15m in the year to
end-August.
The cost of winding down MAM Leisure, the amusement machine subsidiary, is
thought to account for more than Pounds 10m of the deficit. About Pounds
4.5m of losses came from operating activities, of which about Pounds 1m is
thought to have been lost in continuing businesses.
With the disposal of the amusement machine subsidiary, Chrysalis is now
concentrating on music, visual entertainment, radio and its Lasgo export
business.
Last August, the group officially re-entered the music business, nearly two
years after selling its recording interests to Thorn EMI.
Its new label, Echo, is headed by Mr Steve Lewis, former managing director
of Virgin Music.
Last September, Chrysalis announced that Pony Canyon, the music division of
Fujisankei, the Japanese communications group, had agreed to buy a 25.1 per
cent stake in Echo for Dollars 17.5m (Pounds 11.7m).

FT  14 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Anglian Water warns of job losses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Anglian Water yesterday announced the first stage in a restructuring of its
core water business which is likely to result in a number of job losses next
year.
The first to go will be Mr John Simpson, group operations director and
managing director of the utility Anglian Water Services.
Mr Simpson, aged 54, announced his early retirement along with the company's
statement that it would merge Anglian Water Engineering and Business
Services - which provides billing, engineering and computing services - and
'certain support functions' into the regulated business.
His responsibilities will be assumed by Mr Alan Smith, managing director of
AWS. Mr Simpson's remuneration, excluding pension payments, was reported in
last year's accounts as Pounds 120,000.
Mr Chris Mellor, finance director, said it was too early to discuss the
level of job losses. 'But clearly if we are going to constantly improve our
efficiency over time then one of the ways is to gradually reduce our
workforce,' he said.

Berkeley Group, one of Britain's most successful housebuilders during the
recession, yesterday announced an 83 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 12.6m during the six months to October 31.
The company's shares improved 20p to 480p on the announcement.
Turnover rose 37 per cent to Pounds 103.9m as the number of homes sold
increased from 468 to 656. Earnings per share improved 50 per cent to 11p
and the interim dividend is lifted from 1.65p to 1.9p.
The company said it had cash in hand of Pounds 41.7m at the end of October
following its successful Pounds 44.1m rights issue in the spring. That
compared with shareholders funds of Pounds 187.4m.
Mr Tony Pidgley, managing director, said there had been a modest recovery in
the housing market since Britain left the ERM in September last year.
'House prices have recovered by 6 or 7 per cent, the 10 per cent they lost
when we left the ERM,' said Mr Pidgley. 'Demand from purchasers also has
increased. Gross margins as a result have risen to about 20 per cent. The
prospects for housing are the best they have been for five years.'
The rights issue cash is to be used to purchase land for housebuilding. At
the end of October the company owned 4,000 plots with planning permission
with a further 1,000 plots which it expected to buy.
Many of these sites were acquired at the bottom of the recession, two years
ago, when land prices were cheaper. Mr Pidgley estimated that land prices
had risen on average by 30 to 40 per cent during the past 12 months.
He said: 'Some of the prices that have been paid have been too high in my
estimation. We are pleased that we bought early and therefore are under no
pressure to pay these prices.'
He expected house prices to rise by no more than in line with general
inflation during the next two years - 'maybe no more than two or three per
cent a year'.
The company was also pleased with the timing of its Pounds 130m commercial
property joint venture, formed in March 1991 with Saad Investments. This was
sitting on a useful profit following property price rises this year.
COMMENT
Berkeley richly deserves its reputation as one of the best managed companies
in the sector. If the art of housebuilding is the timing of land purchases,
Berkeley has got it right in spades. Having sold its land holdings at the
top of the market in 1989 it started buying before prices began to rise
sharply. The timing of its commercial property joint venture looks equally
impressive. Profits, if the portfolio was sold now, could approach 30 per
cent. Group profits, assuming the portfolio is held, could still reach
Pounds 28m this year and rise to more than Pounds 35m in 1994-95. The shares
based on yield may look a little expensive but are worth it based on the
quality of its management performance to date.

Berkeley Group yesterday announced details of two new joint ventures.
It has been appointed by Thames Water to build an Pounds 80m development at
its redundant Barn Elms reservoir in south-west London. The scheme includes
a 110 acre wildfowl reserve as well as provision for 300 homes.
Berkeley has also formed a joint venture with Higgs &amp; Hill, the building
company, to pursue commercial property developments. Schemes will only be
financed and developed when they have been pre-let to tenants, said Mr Tony
Pidgley, Berkeley's managing director.

FT  14 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Greene King below expectations at Pounds
9.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Depressed conditions in the East Anglian beer market hit Greene King's first
half pre-tax profits which, on an adjusted basis, rose 1 per cent to Pounds
9.6m.
The result was below market expectations and the shares lost 15p to close at
553p.
The company sells two thirds of its beer volumes in East Anglia, but managed
to restrict its sales decline to 1 per cent against a reduction in overall
market demand of 7 per cent. 'The region is the most depressed in the
country,' said Mr Simon Redman, chairman.
'There is little evidence of a pick-up there, though in our new trading
areas further south there are now some signs of recovery.'
On an FRS 3 basis, pre-tax profits for the six months to October 31 rose 41
per cent to Pounds 9.5m, but the figure was distorted by exceptional costs
of Pounds 2.8m last year for the bid for Morland, the Thames Valley-based
brewer.
Mr Redman said that no further move against Morland, in which Greene King
retains a 29 per cent stake, was imminent. 'We shall continue to keep our
options open,' he added.
Trading profit of Pounds 12.7m was 5 per cent lower on turnover ahead 4 per
cent at Pounds 70.2m. Spending on brand advertising increased from Pounds 1m
to Pounds 1.6m.
Apart from difficult trading in its home region, the company faced
competitive discounting in the free pub trade. Profits reflected a slight
reverse in volumes and margins; but bad debt provisions of Pounds 620,000
were in line with last year.
Volumes in the take-home market, which accounts for 3 per cent of sales,
rose 6 per cent.
Managed pubs, increased to 194 with the acquisition in September of 44
outlets from Bass, improved margins and raised drinks sales 13 per cent and
food sales 57 per cent. Food's share of total sales grew from 11 per cent to
13 per cent.
Profits of the company's 676 tenanted pubs were marginally higher in spite
of a decline in beer volumes.
Capital spending on pub acquisitions totalled Pounds 19m and a further
Pounds 3.16m was spent on pub improvements, a third of it on the tenanted
estate.
Borrowings at the half year end amounted to Pounds 99.8m and gearing rose
from 34 per cent to 42 per cent.
Adjusted earnings per share came out at 16.4p (16.3p), and the interim
dividend is raised 4 per cent to 3.85p (3.7p).

FT  14 DEC 93 / IBM spins off FSC defence unit to Loral for Dollars 1.58bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines is to sell its Federal Systems Company
division to Loral, the US defence contractor, for Dollars 1.58bn (Pounds
1.05bn) in cash.
Last month IBM said it had received several offers for FSC, believed to be
from American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, Martin Marietta and the Hughes Aircraft
division of General Motors, as well as Loral.
FSC is a US-based division of IBM that sells computers systems and services,
mainly to US government agencies.
It employs 11,400, almost all in the US. The division posted 1992 revenues
of Dollars 2.2bn, up from Dollars 1.9bn in the previous year, but its
business has been relatively flat amid US defence spending cuts.
For 1992 FSC recorded a net profit of Dollars 71m after being assessed for a
portion of IBM's restructuring charges.
About 60 per cent of FSC's business is defence related and 40 per cent is
complex systems integration projects for agencies such as the Federal
Aviation Administration and the Postal Service.
FSC expects 1993 operating income, before corporate and restructuring
charges, of Dollars 165m on revenues of around Dollars 2.2bn.
Loral is acquiring all of FSC's businesses, except Fed-eral Systems
Marketing, which sells standard IBM products and services to government
agencies.
Loral said the acquisition will be 'anti-dilutive', and will be financed
through borrowings.
'The Federal Systems Company consistently has been a leader in the highly
specialised governmental marketplace,' said Mr Lou Gerstner, IBM chairman.
'Nevertheless, this market is changing rapidly today and we have determined
that this sale is in the best long-term interest of IBM and its
shareholders. We're pleased that FSC employees will join a company that is
committed to the defence marketplace over the long term.'
Mr Gerstner, who joined IBM earlier this year, has made clear he is not in
favour of breaking up the company.
The specialised nature of FSC and its heavy dependence upon defence
contracts, in an era of defence cuts, made it a prime candidate for sale as
IBM slims its operations.
Seperately, the FAA said it was facing a Dollars 1.2bn cost over-run on a
new air traffic monitoring system, a project on which Federal Systems is the
prime contractor.
IBM's share price rose Dollars 2 1/8 to close at Dollars 57 3/8 in New York.
Loral rose Dollars 2 3/4 to close at Dollars 35.

FT  14 DEC 93 / London utility dividend rises 32%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Electricity yesterday announced an increase in its interim dividend
which at 32 per cent was well ahead of any other regional electricity
company.
London's increase reflects the adoption of a policy to pay a third of the
total dividend at the half-way stage. Other electricity distributors tend to
aim for 30 per cent.
Analysts increased their dividend forecasts for the full year marginally to
about 22.2p, after an interim rise from 5.6p to 7.4p.
Mr Roger Urwin, chief executive, said the move to a one-third, two-thirds
split in dividend payouts was logical in view of a change in the company's
business portfolio.
Recently negotiated coal contracts meant the supply business was close to
breaking even in the first half of the year. It had reported substantial
losses.
The withdrawal from retailing and acquisition of BAA's airport distribution
network business for Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted also affected the
balance between the two halves.
In the six months to September 30, London made pre-tax profits of Pounds
69.9m, against Pounds 52m, restated to take account of the new coal
contracts. Turnover on continuing operations was marginally down from Pounds
584.3m to Pounds 581.6m. Earnings per share rose 36 per cent to 24p from
17.7p.
Distribution profits, up from Pounds 53.8m to Pounds 61.6m, were helped by a
1 per cent increase in sales and by cost cuts. Mr Alan Towers, finance
director, said lower than expected increases in inflation and one-off
payments to customers in the autumn meant there would be no significant
increase in distribution revenues for the whole year.
Mr Urwin said a 1.8 per cent growth in commercial volumes was the first
significant increase for 18 months.
Operating costs for the distribution and supply businesses were Pounds 3.7m
down at Pounds 112m. London marginally failed to join the regional power
companies that have become cash positive at the end of the first half.
London has appointed Mr Michael Kersey, chief executive of an Australian
subsidiary of AMEC, as energy services director, and Mr Andrew Robertson,
assistant secretary of Kingfisher, as company secretary.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Grown from fertilisers but floundering in mire: The sorry
history of a one-time high-flyer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For Fisons, the UK pharmaceuticals and scientific equipment group,
yesterday's bad news was only the latest episode in a succession of
management changes, profit warnings and restructurings over the past three
years.
This was once a high-flying company, transformed during the 1980s - under
the then chairman and chief executive Mr John Kerridge - from a loss-making
fertiliser manufacturer into a drugs and equipment group that was touted as
the next Glaxo.
After Mr Kerridge took the helm in 1980, Fisons' share price rose from a low
of 12.5p to a high of 513p in July 1991. Five months later Mr Kerridge
resigned for reasons of ill-health. Yesterday the stock closed down 24p at
113p, its lowest since 1984.
Fisons' difficulties first manifested themselves two years ago following
regulatory problems with the US Food and Drug Administration. The subsequent
management reshuffle left Mr Patrick Egan, a non-executive and Unilever
veteran, as chairman. After some delay, Mr Cedric Scroggs, the scientific
equipment director, was promoted to chief executive.
The first managerial change was fairly orderly. The latest crisis, which
climaxed on at a Sunday night board meeting, has left the company in
disarray, without a chief executive, without a finance director and without
an apparent strategy.
Mr Egan's first task is to replace Mr Scroggs and Mr Roy Thomas, the finance
director who resigned on Friday. That could prove difficult. The chances of
finding a credible executive from the drugs industry to replace Mr Scroggs
are remote, given the company's plight.
The scientific instrument business will suffer a collapse in operating
profits this year, falling from Pounds 12m last year to a loss of about
Pounds 16m.
Mr Egan says the business is a curate's egg. The organic analysis equipment
operations are good; parts of the inorganic business are performing well,
but others are in difficulty. One inorganic business is regarded as
non-core, while surface science is losing money.
In the drugs division some dubious accounting practices have come to light.
It was boosting sales and profits by offering heavy discounts to wholesalers
towards the year-end. This policy, which started as early as 1984, became
increasingly important until, in 1991, it generated additional sales of
Pounds 78m out of a divisional turnover of Pounds 427m.
After Mr Kerridge left, the board decided to gradually wind down such
discounts, reducing them to Pounds 62m last year and about Pounds 50m this
year.
However, the collapse in the scientific instruments business forced the
board's hand.
Mr Mike Redmond, pharmaceuticals managing director, insists the division is
sustainable. He has launched a cost-cutting programme called 'funding
Fisons' future'. Its initial aim is to cut 15 per cent from fixed costs,
saving Pounds 25m a year by 1996. Provisions of Pounds 10m will be made in
1994 and Pounds 5m in 1995 and there should be a net benefit in each year,
according to Mr Egan. He insists the company has cleared out the stables and
management can now take a firm grip.
But management protests that the pharmaceuticals business is sustainable are
open to question. The division's new product, Tilade, has proved a
disappointment in Europe, it has no product in late-stage development, and
it has not been able to obtain compounds from other sources.
The obvious answer is a merger or takeover by another company. One option is
for a Japanese drugs group, anxious to acquire development expertise and
distribution in the US and Europe, to approach Fisons. The timing is
awkward, though, because of Japan's recession.
Nevertheless, with Fisons' share price cheaper than at any point in a
decade, a suitor may emerge. Otherwise it is difficult to see how this
former fertilisers group can escape from the mire.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Lifeboat arranged for bondholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fisons yesterday sent out a lifeboat to holders of its only public bond
issue, a Pounds 100m offering of 10-year Eurobonds, by offering to buy back
the bonds at Friday's closing level or to exchange them for a new issue of
five-year bonds, writes Antonia Sharpe.
Investment bankers at JP Morgan, who had spent the weekend hammering out the
strategy, said that Fisons had taken this action because it wanted to
maintain a presence in the bond market without placing investors at a
disadvantage.
News of Fisons' restructuring plans caused some embarrassment to JP Morgan
as only two months ago it had arranged the company's first public bond
offering since 1986. The deal had been seen as a feather in JP Morgan's cap
in view of Fisons' lack of a credit rating and its poor performance in the
stock market.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Air France presents recovery plans to unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Christian Blanc, chairman of Air France, yesterday revealed proposals to
stem losses at the state-owned airline and set a target of matching the
performance of Lufthansa, its German rival, by 1997.
The proposals, which come two months after a recovery programme was
abandoned in the face of a bitter strike by employees, have been presented
to the airline's 14 union groups. A final document will be discussed with
company employees in January and February.
Mr Blanc, who took over as chairman following the resignation of Mr Bernard
Attali, the architect of the previous recovery plan, painted a grim picture
of the group's financial and operating performance. His response involves
cost-cutting, plans to increase productivity, and the prospect of allocating
shares to employees in return for pay cuts.
Mr Blanc told employees that Air France would report losses of about
FFr7.5bn (Pounds 862m) this year and would have debts of FFr36bn at the end
of December, compared with about FFr26bn last year. 'Air France does not
earn enough, spends too much, and its productivity is inferior to its
competitors,' he said. 'The situation requires a rapid change in methods and
morale - a supersonic acceleration.'
Air France, which is due to be privatised, has set a target of a 10 per cent
increase in productivity for each of the next three years. Operating costs
would be cut by 7 per cent a year and staff costs by 10 per cent each year
for the next three years.
Mr Blanc wants to use voluntary means, such as early retirement, to cut
staff numbers by 2,100 from the current level of just under 63,000.
The airline's higher-paid employees will also be offered shares in the
airline in 1997 in return for voluntary pay cuts. Mr Blanc said it could
involve 'a significant part of the company's capital'.
The national carrier also said it had to reform its rigid bureaucracy and
inflexible work practices, cited as among the main causes of its high costs
and losses. On transatlantic flights, for example, Air France said it spent
FFr117 for every FFr100 received.
Mr Blanc described the situation as 'grave, but not irreversible'. Lufthansa
was chosen as a target because it was a similar size and faced similar
social costs and conditions.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Trafalgar braces for bad news: Provisions and large
write-downs on revalued property will swamp conglomerate's profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trafalgar House, the troubled conglomerate, will today report substantially
larger than expected year-end asset writedowns and provisions.
Full-year provisions are likely to total about Pounds 400m dwarfing even the
most pessimistic estimates from analysts, who have been predicting
provisions of up to Pounds 270m, including Pounds 120m of provisions to
cover restructuring and property write-downs announced at the interim stage.
Provisions on this scale will swamp the expected small underlying annual
profit and appear to confirm Trafalgar's reputation for coming up with
unexpected bad news. Last year Trafalgar reported a Pounds 30.3m pre-tax
loss.
The size of the year-end provisions reflects the determination of
Trafalgar's new management to get to grips with the group's problems and
clean up its battered balance sheet.
Trafalgar is now firmly under the influence of Hong Kong Land, which has
invested Pounds 200m and built up a 25 per cent stake. Hong Kong Land has
four board representatives including Mr Simon Keswick, chairman, and Mr
David Gawler, finance director.
Trafalgar's board instituted a business review with the group's new
financial advisers, Robert Fleming and Schroder Wagg. Independent valuations
were made of the group's properties, including group-occupied properties
which have previously been held at cost or on the basis of earlier
valuations; the commercial property portfolio; the group's hotels including
the Ritz, which were last valued in 1989; and the Emerald oil rig in the
North Sea. It is understood that these new valuations have shown the need
for substantial write-downs.
Some analysts also believe that Trafalgar's board may have decided to repay
part of its more costly debt such as the 10 7/8 per cent bonds due in 2014.
This would absorb some of the proceeds of the planned Pounds 400m rights
issue of convertible preference shares, details of which are also expected
today.
The rights issue was announced in October when Trafalgar issued a profits
warning and said the business review had concluded that the February rights
issue was not sufficient to to support the group's expanding engineering and
construction businesses, the refurbishment of its fleet and plans to invest
in infrastructure projects. Trafalgar's share price closed 2p higher at 87
1/2p.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Thorp set to receive go-ahead this week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A decision allowing the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield,
Cumbria, to go ahead is expected within 48 hours.
Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, and Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture
minister, have been meeting for weeks to decide how to reduce the risk of
environmental groups persuading the courts to overturn the decision.
Greenpeace, the pressure group which has most vigorously opposed the Pounds
2.8bn plant, has said it will apply immediately for a judicial review.
The government is expected to tell British Nuclear Fuels, the plant's owner,
that it can begin operating Thorp within weeks. The delay is intended to
give time for a legal challenge.
Ministers have been under pressure to announce a decision before parliament
goes into recess at the end of this week.
Pressure on the government will come as politicians from Japan, the UK and
US urge the government not to allow the plant to start.
Forty-two members of congress and parliament from the three countries have
written to Mr John Major, the prime minister, urging the project's
cancellation.
Their letter was also sent to Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, prime minister of Japan,
whose nuclear utilities are Thorp's biggest customers, and to President Bill
Clinton of the US, which supplied much of the fuel used in the Japanese
nuclear reactors.
The letter says: 'The start-up and continued operation of Thorp necessarily
will result in a large stockpile of plutonium, contravening the stated
policies of Japan and the US.'
Members of the US Congress have been urging Mr Clinton for months to step
into the Thorp debate. The administration has said it believes that
continued production of plutonium is not justified on economic or national
security grounds. Thorp is expected to produce about 60 tons of plutonium
over the next decade.
Among those signing the letter were Senator Dale Bumpers, Congressman Joseph
Kennedy and Congressman Pete Stark in the US, Mr Tadatoshi Akiba and Mr
Tatsukuni Komori in Japan, and Mr Tony Benn in the UK.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Gatt deal hopes hinge on US audio-visual demands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Successful completion of the Uruguay Round of trade talks appeared last
night to hinge on proposals presented in Brussels by Sir Leon Brittan,
European Union trade commissioner, detailing US demands on access to
Europe's television and film markets.
EU foreign ministers, after their briefing from Sir Leon, broadly endorsed
his negotiating stance on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade deal.
Sir Leon told them it offered unprecedented market openings and the prospect
of fair competition in international trade but said the EU should resist the
US demands on access to Europe's cinema and television markets.
After the talks, ministers agreed to reconvene tomorrow to discuss the Gatt
deal. Sir Leon returned to Geneva where he went into late-night negotiations
with Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative.
Sir Leon's spokesman said: 'It is extremely delicate . . . there is still a
considerable climate of tension.' On the audio-visual dispute, Mr Douglas
Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, said: 'The Americans are pushing very hard
but equally there is very strong resistance.'
A senior German official said there had almost been a solution to the
controversy on Sunday night but the American team had presented new demands
on President Bill Clinton's instruction.
Mr Kantor refused to expand on the proposals he had laid out to Sir Leon,
nor on how the US would respond if the EU rejected them. He remained adamant
that settlement of the audio-visual issue was critical to successful
completion of the round.
Although the audio-visual issue continued to block settlement of the round
just two days ahead of the deadline, Gatt officials reported hectic progress
in all other areas. Settlement of a row over US demands for changes to
protect its anti-dumping laws provided an overnight impetus.
One official said that 'the gavel had dropped' on almost 97 per cent of the
Uruguay Round text. 'We have achieved an extraordinary series of agreements
in a very short period of time,' said Mr Peter Sutherland, director general
of Gatt.
The US audio-visual proposals included calls for US programmes not to be
restricted from prime-time viewing; for Europe's broadcast directive not to
apply to new technologies; for Europe's royalties on blank tapes to be
payable to US as well as European artists, but spent in Europe; and for no
restrictions on video-on-request channels.
It was suggested that Sir Leon proposed to EU foreign ministers that only
the last of these proposals be accepted. He told ministers that the EU
should reserve the right to keep the audio-visual sector out of the Gatt
deal altogether, as France has demanded.
Fears receded that political crisis in Japan might scupper the round when
the Social Democrats, who form part of the ruling coalition, softened their
stance by backing plans to allow limited rice imports.

FT  14 DEC 93 / PO chief warns of increase in charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Post Office investment plans and profitability are being put at risk because
of uncertainty over the government's review, the corporation said yesterday.
In an outspoken attack on ministers for failing to make up their minds, Mr
Mike Heron, chairman, threatened an increase in postal charges if the
government did not change the present regime.
He said: 'The long uncertainty is highly damaging, especially when coupled
to the trebling this year of the cash we have to pay the Treasury. I do not
believe the status quo can continue.'
The Post Office's external finance limit target - the amount it has to pay
the government - has risen to Pounds 230m next year, and is set at Pounds
210m for the following year.
In the short term, Mr Bill Cockburn, chief executive, said it could meet the
targets only at the expense of capital expenditure and investment. In the
long term, it would mean higher stamp prices and might even threaten the
corporation's 15-year history of profitability.
The Department of Trade and Industry, which initiated the review 18 months
ago, is understood to have ruled out full-scale privatisation, but is known
to be sympathetic to its call for greater commercial freedom.
It said yesterday its review, which is not expected to be published until
early next year, was 'complex and difficult'. It added that pressure on
public finances meant that everyone, including the Post Office, had to make
a contribution to the PSBR.
However, Mr Edward Leigh, who was responsible for the Post Office until
dismissed as trade and industry minister last summer, accused the government
of a 'political funk' for not privatising the corporation.
Mr Robin Cook, Labour's shadow trade and industry secretary, said: 'The
strong language which Mike Heron uses to complain about the government is
unprecedented for a chairman of a public corporation.'

The new rules allowing a five-day delay in publicising large UK equity
trades, introduced yesterday, are the stock exchange's latest effort to
balance the interests of market makers with the overriding need for
transparency. Publication of all bargains within five minutes, introduced
after Big Bang, was considered too tight and discouraged market makers from
dealing in large blocks of shares. Yet the 24-hour delay in publication of
large trades, allowed after 1989, fell foul of the Office of Fair Trading.
The 90-minute delay allowed until yesterday satisfied the regulators, but
still left the market makers unhappy.
It is a fair bet that the new rules will not last long. The maximum five-day
delay is generous, but the stock exchange has defined a large trade more
narrowly than before. On average, less than 100 bargains a day meet the new
criteria, of which only a handful typically involve FT-SE 100 stocks. Even
so, any erosion of transparency creates problems of its own. Equity options
traders might feel themselves at a disadvantage to market makers in the cash
stock. The proof of the pudding will be whether the rules increase the
number of block trades and thus improve liquidity, especially in smaller
company shares. Still, the criteria for judging success has been left
worryingly vague. The regulators would do well to make sure that marginal
improvements in liquidity are not being bought with significant losses of
transparency.

Granada's barb that an independent LWT risked being marginalised in the
brave new world of television has clearly struck a funny bone. LWT has since
been constructing inventive theories for how a 'quartet' of television
stations could now merge. LWT is quite right to explore every avenue to
maximise shareholder value. But from the outside, it is hard to see how it
can devise a satisfactory scenario.
LWT might have hoped its 14 per cent shareholding in Yorkshire-Tyne Tees
would have provided a sound starting point. But this liaison has turned into
a nightmarish blind date. The confirmation of further bad news and a passed
dividend from Yorkshire yesterday has only complicated the game. A straight
deal with Anglia might have represented a simpler and more attractive
defence.
Granada will be itching to conclude its bid quickly to frustrate any
alternative plans and may be prepared to sweeten its terms to do so. LWT's
institutional investors, who bought shares in anticipation of industry
consolidation, are likely to prove fickle friends, especially when prices of
30 times historic earnings are being thrown around for starters. They may
also dwell on the longer term trends in television. After reaping the
benefits of the cyclical rebound in advertising revenue, ITV franchises will
face a tough challenge growing earnings thereafter. Commercial television is
a relatively mature industry. Future advertising growth will be at least
partially undermined by emerging satellite and cable rivals.

With wholesale price inflation apparently so muted and manufacturing output
flat, it is not immediately obvious why the Bank of England should still be
banging on about corporate margins. Where domestic margins have increased,
it is more a case of costs being cut than prices put up. The manufacturing
output figures may understate the true level of demand - surely the spurt in
electricity production cannot all be due to cold weather. But the anecdotal
evidence suggests consumers remain extraordinarily price conscious.
The export trade presents a different picture. If they believe figures which
have become highly suspect, the authorities have some reason for
disappointment that export prices have increased about as fast as import
prices since the UK left the ERM. Business is apparently taking advantage of
the devaluation to widen margins rather than increase volume. The trend is
worrying because it suggests failure to adapt to a low inflation
environment. Presumably companies would be jacking up domestic prices if
only the market would permit. The Bank will have to labour the point to
drive home what is a long term message. If the fight against inflation is
not to be too painful, companies must believe that the authorities will not
accommodate excessive margin increases. That does not exclude the
possibility of lower base rates in the short term. Tomorrow's retail prices
index could be a better guide to the immediate chances than yesterday's
speech by the deputy governor.

FT  14 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Fisons' bitter pill
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fisons' ability to shock knows no bounds. Poor relationships with regulators
and inadequate manufacturing standards in pharmaceuticals were the cause of
its pre-Christmas profits warning two years ago. Now it transpires that
profits have been massaged by selling cut-priced drugs to wholesalers
shortly before the year end. Setting the accounts straight will cost Pounds
28m this year. The swing into loss in scientific instruments is more
worrying. Even if management grip can be restored, the business looks poorly
positioned in weak markets.
The broader lesson is that Fisons' top management has not undergone the
necessary transformation since Mr John Kerridge resigned as chairman and
chief executive in 1991. Instead of introducing a tough outsider at that
stage, Mr Cedric Scroggs was elevated from within. His departure doubtless
owes much to his role as architect of the apparently unsound instruments
division. But other directors must bear their share of opprobrium for not
tackling the problems sooner. It must now be doubtful whether Fisons can
attract a figure of sufficient stature to restore investors' confidence.
While cutting the dividend will help conserve cash at a time of rising
capital expenditure, it is by no means clear that the company has the
resources to flourish as an independent force in pharmaceuticals. There is
always the hope that a drug industry giant will step in to provide both cash
and management muscle. A market valuation of around Pounds 750m at
yesterday's closing share price might start to arouse interest. While the
price is falling and the surprises keep coming, though, potential bidders
have every incentive to wait.

How the mighty thud when they fall. Once France's arts minister, Jack Lang
now needs a job; he has been stripped of his parliamentary seat for having
spent too much on his campaign in the spring elections.
Lang, 54, bluntly denounced the loss of his seat as an 'attack from the
right'. True, the conservatives never concealed their hatred of him, one of
the most popular and powerful members of the socialist cabinet and a close
confidant of President Francois Mitterrand. They also loathed his policies
as arts minister, not least his elaborate grands projets, like the Louvre
renovation scheme.
But Lang undeniably went over the FFr500,000 limit that French politicians
are allowed to spend on their electoral campaigns - FFr90,000 over the limit
to be precise.
He is also banned from standing for the French parliament for at least a
year. That may not trouble him too much; he is eyeing next year's European
parliament elections.

US secretary of state Warren Christopher has a pressing task: to find a
deputy to succeed Clifton Wharton, summarily disposed of last month.
He has a few names in the hat but it's reasonable to think Raymond Seitz,
currently ambassador in London, is in with a fair chance. Christopher is
said to be looking for an experienced career diplomat.
Seitz is certainly that. He also has the advantage of early availability;
next year retired Admiral William Crowe takes over in London.
Two other contenders - Tom Pickering and Stapleton Roy  - occupy the hot
spots of Moscow and Beijing respectively and may be difficult to move.
Another veteran diplomat, Morton Abramowitz, now running the Carnegie
Endowment in Washington, has ruled himself out because of sharp disagreement
with US policies in Bosnia. But Michael Armacost, former US Ambassador in
Japan, is free.
Whoever gets the nod still faces confirmation by the Senate, which has been
sticky with nominations this year. President Clinton has ineffectually
complained about the Senate's sluggish ways. So far this year he has sent
618 candidates for the top 957 jobs; but only 465 are in place.

Kroll Associates, the international corporate sleuths, is known to be a
company that likes to get its name in the story, if not in the headlines.
But on the subject of Michael Oatley, its UK director of operations and the
man reported to have acted as intermediary between the British government
and the IRA in 1990, it is unusually reticent.
Oatley joined Kroll in February 1991 after 'retiring' from the British
intelligence agency MI6. At one time he was seconded to the Northern Ireland
Office and did work in the Foreign Office's Middle East department. Beyond
that, Kroll won't be drawn, pleading the Official Secrets Act. Yesterday
58-year-old Oatley was away on Kroll business at an 'undisclosed foreign
destination'.

WTA might make it. GAT is in with a chance, as is MTA. But GATO and WHAT are
probably all dead ducks.
There's nothing like skirmishing over acronyms to get a serious politico hot
and bothered. The selection above are all candidates to replace the scarcely
understood Gatt, or General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, due to expire
any minute.
US negotiators fret that MTO, or Multilateral Trade Organisation will
displease the US Congress. It sounds too much like ITO, or International
Trade Organisation, which Congress vetoed in the late 1940s on the grounds
that trade sovereignty was threatened.
In 1990 Congress raised the same objection against WTO, World Trade
Organisation. So maybe General Agreements on Trade, GAT? The General
Agreements on Trade Organisation - GATO  - fails because it's Spanish for
cat.
But the biggest no-hoper so far proffered must be the World High Authority
on Trade, or WHAT.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Personal View: How to contain ITV's menacing octopus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL GRADE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's push to enable independent television companies to become
major international media players by relaxing ownership rules is in danger
of wrecking its own policy of encouraging more domestic competition. It is
hastily enacting legislation that may result in new competitors and small
existing regional ITV companies going out of business altogether. The
government seems prepared to leave the regulators - the Independent
Television Commission and the Office of Fair Trading - to sort out the mess.
It is not yet 12 months since the 40-year ITV airtime sales monopoly ended,
when Channel 4 started selling its own airtime, and the first glimmer of
competition was introduced. Yet before that market has even had a chance to
develop, we have legislation going through Parliament this week which will
allow Carlton to take over Central, and Granada to take over LWT - moves
that have the potential to restrict, not encourage, competition.
Concentration of ownership in principle is probably a good thing. A
rationalisation of the antiquated and cumbersome ITV federal system is long
overdue. But what the government has failed to recognise in this hasty
revision of its new (and very recent) ownership rules is its devastating
effect on the fragile and newly developing competition for domestic TV
advertising.
Ownership is one thing - selling airtime another. If Carlton is allowed to
sell airtime for (as well as own) Central, and keep its resultant minority
stakes in GMTV and Meridian, we may well have a potential world player, but
the government will also have created a menacing octopus whose tentacles
will strangle home competition.
Similarly, Granada's hostile bid for LWT would put it in an equally dominant
position, with minority stakes in GMTV plus Yorkshire and Tyne Tees, and a
sales arrangement with Scottish Television.
There you have it - a recipe for two huge potential players to dominate the
scene, with the capacity to carve up the ITV production network between
them, and the airtime sales market as well. Two players would have control
and/or influence over a combined total of 70 per cent of Channel 3's
revenue.
Certainly Channel 4 will feel the pressure, but not as much as those
Cinderella companies which have not been invited to the takeover ball,
regional licensees such as Border, West Country, Anglia and new satellite
and cable ventures.
There is a simple solution to this cartel scenario which would in no way
interfere with the government's global strategy for ITV. It lies in
preserving the ITC's so-called 25 per cent rule. This regulation limits the
size of ITV joint sales operations to 25 per cent each of ITV's total
revenue. The ITC laid down this rule as recently as 1991 because it was
concerned that the new competitors, such as Channel 4, had not become
established.
The major advertisers I have spoken to see only one consequence of relaxing
the 25 per cent rule - arbitrary price rises by the big two ITV operators,
Carlton/Central and Granada/LWT. As evidence I offer this response last week
from one large advertising agency: 'We support the 25 per cent rule as it
is, but we daren't say so publicly. We can't afford to risk the biggest ITV
players taking it out on us.'
The 25 per cent rule is up for review early next year. The ITC must not
relax it. Competition has not developed as fast as it might have. Yes,
Channel 4 is a great competitive success, but it holds less than 20 per cent
of the television advertising market. There is no sign yet of a fifth
national channel which would offer more competition. Growth of satellite
advertising revenue has not taken off yet. ITV remains the biggest game in
town with 75 per cent of revenue.
Incidentally, the government might have avoided lumbering the ITC and the
OFT with this problem if it had provided Carlton and Granada with the
obvious bidding competitors - other UK media players. What stopped it from
relaxing cross-media ownership rules at the same time? This would have
allowed other global British media players such as Pearson, the Daily
Telegraph group and Associated Newspapers to join the TV ownership club.
Could it just be that the government was afraid that, if it relaxed these
rules, its favoured player, Rupert Murdoch's News International, would have
been first into the new members' book?
Ah well, just another missed opportunity for the government to get its
broadcasting policy on to its own, much-vaunted level playing field. Thank
goodness for the ITC's 25 per cent rule - it is the last bastion of fair
play. Now is the time for all good regulators to come to the aid of the
market.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Private post
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is easy to sympathise with Mr Mike Heron, chairman of the UK's Post
Office. His comments yesterday about a growing sense of crisis in the
organisation and the need to avoid a spiral of decline may be exaggerated.
But the frustration caused by the government's inability to make up its mind
about the Post Office's future and by continual raiding of its coffers is
real enough.
Ideally, the Post Office would be privatised. This would free the group to
act in a commercial manner. Gone would be the days when investment plans
were curbed as a result of being included within the public sector borrowing
requirement. The Post Office would also, no doubt, find scope for efficiency
among its 180,000 staff.
Unfortunately, privatisation does not seem to be on the agenda. Although
ministers have been reviewing the options for 18 months, few believe they
will back a sell-off. This is largely for political reasons. The government,
mindful of its slim parliamentary majority, is anxious to avoid the sort of
controversy that surrounded rail privatisation.
But ministers should not settle for inaction. Instead, they should embrace a
twin-track approach: granting the Post Office greater commercial freedom,
while setting up a transparent regulatory structure.
First, the Post Office should be free to exploit its existing assets more
intensively. It should, for example, be able to use its post offices to
distribute a wider range of services. The more the network is used, the less
the danger of politically damaging closures. Moreover, though it is unlikely
the Post Office can be free of PSBR constraints until it is privatised,
there is no reason why it should not come up with imaginative proposals for
attracting private finance for new investment. Such a market test for risky
new ventures like electronic mail, where the Post Office's capacity to
compete has yet to be proved, would in any case be better than splashing out
taxpayers' cash.
Second, setting up a regulator now should help calm some of the anxieties
backbenchers have over privatisation. It would, for example, be possible to
work out how to maintain a nationwide delivery service while opening the
postal business to greater competition.
Such a twin-track approach would not only be desirable in itself. It would
also prepare the Post Office for the time when privatisation becomes
politically feasible. Ministers cannot afford to go on dithering.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
European leaders have been emphasising the principle of subsidiarity to
counter post-Maastricht complaints that Europe's decision-makers had lost
contact with the people. Decentralising, where possible, the exercise of
power throughout the European Union represents a plausible way of quelling
voters' suspicions about the influence of unaccountable bureaucracies.
However, to adapt a phrase from its deliberations on unemployment, the EU
must recognise that there are no miracle cures to the problem of putting
subsidiarity into practice.
The weekend announcement that the European Commission will repeal 16 pieces
of legislation deemed to contradict subsidiarity is an encouraging step.
Much more needs to be done, however, both to define the areas where the
doctrine can sensibly be applied, and to make more transparent the way it is
implemented.
The Euro-laws to be recast into more manageable 'framework' directives
include 1980 legislation on drinking and bathing water quality. Britain and
France argued that these gave national authorities insufficient leeway to
set their own methods of achieving overriding quality and health standards.
It is ironic that two countries with highly centralised governments should
have successfully defended a principle normally seen as promoting
devolution. However, detailed regulations on water quality - an area which
does not materially affect cross-border competition, and where centralised
rules offer no economies of scale - can be left to democratic forces in
member countries.
Rather as attic-clogging lumber must regularly be discarded, continuous
checks are needed to ascertain whether Brussels' existing stocks of
legislation are in line with subsidiarity. Equally important, new laws must
conform to the principle. The Commission needs to exercise a benign
centralising influence in verifying that member states enforce directives on
the single market. As the Union matures, the Commission's role will move
anyway towards executing and monitoring measures, rather than initiating
them.
One problem is the opacity of the system under which governments ask the
Commission to check whether legislation passes the subsidiarity test. If the
EU set up a consultative body of independent experts to produce annual
reports on how subsidiarity is being applied, that would be a valuable way
to show voters that the principle adds up to more than just one inelegant
word.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Bitter harvest of disunity: Divided reformers in Russia have
failed to stem the rise of extreme right and left parties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The scale of the defeat for reform in Russia is potentially massive - but
only potentially. Enough political scope remains for reform to continue, or
at least for the achievements of the past two years to be preserved. It
depends on the main actors: most of all, on the lead player, President Boris
Yeltsin.
The incomplete results of Russia's first democratic elections on Sunday show
the Liberal Democratic party of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky in either first or
close second place in the half of the State Duma, or lower house, chosen by
party lists. The Communists are either second or third. A senior aide to Mr
Yeltsin forecast early yesterday that the anti-reformists would command
double the vote of the reformists, and while the percentages might change,
the basic fact would not.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, leader of Russia's Choice and first deputy prime minister,
has already conceded defeat of a kind - chiding himself and the other
reformist parties for disunity, and commenting that: 'Frankly, there was
something so comic about this figure (of Zhirinovsky), he seemed simply a
kind of parody of Adolf Hitler. We didn't fully grasp how serious was his
threat.'
The threat from the neo-fascists and the Communists is in one sense
aggravated because they - especially Mr Zhirinovsky - have no clear
programme. Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the Yabloko group, which is
likely to be the fourth-largest party in the parliament, and who thus can
claim to be the second reformist party, said that 'their programmes are
neither for the market nor against the market. They are the most dangerous
kind of demagogues.'
Mr Zhirinovsky, displaying once more the demonic energy which appears to
power him beyond the laws of thermodynamics, peppered the media yesterday
with interviews demanding for his party the chairmanship of the lower house,
declaring his party's readiness to enter government, and forecasting Russian
expansion as far as the Indian Ocean.
He must be very pleased. For the past two years he has run an organisation
whose only well-known member is himself, and which has never entered into
coalitions with other nationalists. His steady belief in his own talents,
energy and mission to gain political power, coupled with a machine-gun wit
and breathtaking territorial claims, does indeed call up a vision of Adolf
Hitler returning for the second time as farce - but a farce which still has
the capacity to transform itself back into tragedy.
Mr Yeltsin, it would seem, has two alternatives in face of this surge from
the extreme right and left. First, he can broadly continue his programme -
as Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, yesterday urged him to do by
showing 'political will' in face of the nationalist surge. This would mean
retaining reformers like Mr Fyodorov, Mr Gaidar and Mr Anatoly Chubais, the
deputy prime minister, for privatisation; continuing to support their
economic plans; and attempting to steer legislation through parliament by
putting together coalitions issue by issue.
This is possible, in theory. The passing of the draft constitution has made
Mr Yeltsin one of the most powerful elective presidents in the world, with
the ability to issue decrees without any let or hindrance by parliament.
Apart from his powers, he has shown in the past two years no inhibition
about using patronage to buy over those whom he cannot persuade.
Further, the composition of the parliament is largely non-party: members of
the 178-strong Federation Council, or upper house, are elected from the
regions and republics on the basis more of their local status than their
ideology. The same, to a slightly lesser extent, applies to the half of the
lower house elected on a first-past-the-post system. The impression gained
by many foreign observers was, first, that most people were confused by the
complex voting papers and, second, they voted on name recognition, not party
affiliation.
The result is likely to reproduce what was evident in the previous Supreme
Soviet - a bolota, or marsh, in which the deputies roll this way and that.
The threat is that the marsh hardens in opposition to a president and a
government which ignore their wishes.
However, Mr Yeltsin's instincts and history may lead him in a second
direction, that of the presidential figure who wishes to remain above the
conflict by constructing a government which draws its membership from a
wider constituency of views than the present one - with ministers either
coming directly from the neo-fascist and Communist parties, or reflecting
their position.
The first signs are that he will go this way. Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, the
Mephistophelean figure who is his press secretary, wasted little time in
telling the Interfax news agency that there was much in the fascists' and
communists' electoral programmes which 'quite corresponds to the social
aspect of the president's policies - that is, the social policy of the
state, patriotism, making Russia great'.
The latter two appeal to Mr Zhirinovsky, and to Mr Gennady Zyuganov, the
Communist leader who has repeatedly said he is a Russian nationalist before
he is a communist internationalist. However, Mr Kostikov's bland statement
masks the obvious question - how far does Mr Yeltsin's embrace of patriotism
have to go before it finds common ground with a neo-fascist party whose
leader has claimed Poland and Finland for a renewed Russian empire? Even Mr
Zyuganov was quoted yesterday as saying that he did not go down the same
road as Mr Zhirinovsky: 'We are realists.'
However, a lurch towards a harder-edged nationalism seems inevitable,
resulting in harsher treatment of the former Soviet republics to bring them
into line. This would confront impoverished Ukraine, in deep debt to Russia
and possessing missiles, a naval fleet and a territory (Crimea) which Russia
wants, with the terrible dilemma of knuckling under or attempting to
withstand a colder blast from the east than it has been used to since
Mikhail Gorbachev came to power eight years ago. It would also threaten the
fragile relations with Latvia and Estonia, where Russian troops remain; and
make clear to the Central Asian and Caucasian states that their leash is
still held by Moscow, and that it is shortening.
Were Mr Yeltsin to sway in this direction, it is all but certain that the
reformers would feel constrained to leave the cabinet, or would be asked to
do so. They have had only mixed success this past year; and though Mr
Fyodorov has made much of keeping the last quarter's budget within tight
limits, he appears to have done so only by cutting or deferring expenditure
which will have to be put through in this coming year. Only if they have an
even more solid base for support than they have enjoyed so far could they
hope to deepen reforms: and they evidently do not have that. Their tone
yesterday was mournful: Mr Chubais has been especially emphatic that 'I will
not shake fascists by the hand.'
The next stage of economic reform was always going to be the hardest.
Whether it was to be driven by Mr Gaidar's insistence on tight money, or Mr
Yavlinsky's preference for demonopolisation and faster privatisation, vast
unemployment is likely to burst into the open as practically bankrupt
enterprises go belly-up and cast their workers out to fend for themselves.
Giant plants - like Uralmash engineering in Ekaterinburg, the Vaz car plant
in Nizhny Novgorod and the Zil truck and car plant in Moscow - are now
working short time and juggling with huge debts.
The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, poised to support and to
lend to a reformist government, are now high and dry. A planned timetable of
meetings designed to drum up a new surge of aid for Russia, including a
summit between Presidents Yeltsin and Clinton in Moscow next month, is now
in doubt.
There has been a real advance in these elections: Russia has succeeded in
adopting a constitution which proclaims it an advanced democratic state
committed to private property and the rule of law. But the reality of these
grand phrases is still in suspension.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Russia's election result has been greeted with dismay, even before it is
fully known, by Russian would-be reformers and their friends in the west.
This is because of the strong showing by Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's
ludicrously misnamed Liberal Democratic party, and by the communists, and
the disappointing performance of the pro-reform parties associated with
President Boris Yeltsin.
Yet there may be greater cause for concern about the way Mr Yeltsin and his
allies will react to the result than about the result itself. Mr Yeltsin has
achieved his stated objective of winning popular approval for a new
constitution which gives him extensive powers and severely restricts the
power of parliament to prevent him using them. He now has the constitutional
strength, and his incumbent prime minister, Mr Viktor Chernamyrdin, has
already shown some of the political skills, required to manage a weak and
fractious parliament. Their western friends must encourage them to persevere
with reform, because only accelerated reform offers any hope of delivering
the economic benefits which may persuade Russians to resist the siren songs
of communist nostalgia and nationalist escapism.
Russia's most crying needs now are for legislation which will allow it to
attract foreign capital, for an effective privatisation of land enabling it
to return to self-sufficiency in grain, and for basic institutional reforms
allowing the government to control the money supply and ensure that real
interest rates are positive. Mr Yeltsin now has the chance - almost
certainly his last - to fulfil those needs. If he again hesitates in the
face of opposition, as he has too often in the past, he will be lost.
He would be especially unwise to seek to co-opt Mr Zhirinovsky, or to woo
away his supporters, by embracing some of their truculent chauvinism towards
the west and towards Russia's neighbours. To a limited extent he already
tried that during the election campaign - but fascism thrives on
appeasement, as history all too abundantly shows.
By the same token, the west must be prepared to resist any argument that
Russian appetites or neuroses should be indulged for fear of strengthening
Mr Zhirinovsky's support. It should continue to support Russia's political
and economic transformation - indeed should do so more effectively than
hitherto, notably by opening its markets more readily to Russian products.
But this can only be translated into support for Mr Yeltsin personally to
the extent that he continues to act as the agent of that transformation, and
if in foreign policy he shows full respect for international law and the
integrity of Russia's neighbours.
It should be made clear, in particular, that Russia has no veto over other
countries' membership of western organisations. Nato membership cannot be
extended lightly, and would in any case not solve the most immediate
security problems of central and east European countries. But it is those
problems - rather than the sensitivities of Russia's domestic politics,
which remain hard for outsiders to predict let alone influence - that should
be the determining consideration. The west can not afford to neglect the
vital task of filling the security vacuum in central and eastern Europe by
integrating it into the west European economy, and preparing the countries
concerned for EU membership at the earliest possible date.
It would be wrong to despair of a successful outcome to Russia's transition.
The election result merely underlines dangers and difficulties of which
serious observers were well aware. In response, the west must continue to
strike a delicate balance between strengthening Russia's understandably
nervous neighbours and working for the greater prize: a stable and
prosperous Russia anchored by ties of permanent friendship to the west.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Right diagnosis, wrong remedy for
Maastricht fatigue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GARY MILLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Edward Mortimer is right in his diagnosis of post-Maastricht fatigue in
Europe but wrong to look to the European Constitutional Group's
'constitution' for a cure (December 8), particularly in advance of the next
enlargement of the Union planned for 1995.
Behind this initiative is nothing less than a mischievous attempt to unravel
decades of slow and painful constitutional development that has successfully
provided for peace and an expansion of trade in the relations between an
ever-increasing number of member countries.
This achievement has been based on the very principles that the ECG seek to
undermine: the supremacy of Community (now Union) law refereed by an
independent court; the ability of the Commission to make legislative
proposals independently of particular national interests; the possibility of
majority votes in the council of ministers, so that one recalcitrant country
cannot veto the progress of others; and the ability of a directly-elected
European parliament to offer the democratic scrutiny of what goes on in
Brussels that one national parliament cannot hope to provide alone.
There can be no doubt that, without these principles, however imperfectly
they have been applied, we would not have had the single market or the
prospect of monetary union.
A constitution could bring the present Union closer to its citizens and make
its institutional machinery more open and comprehensible. But it will not do
so by ignoring these tried and tested principles.
For example, the ECG's proposal to add another parliamentary chamber
composed of national representatives to the Brussels ensemble will just
confuse the public even further and render an already cumbersome
decision-making process unworkable.
For a remedy to the malady he identifies, Mr Mortimer would do better to
look to the draft constitution for the Union which has been drawn up in the
past few weeks by the European parliament.
This will probably be presented to national parliaments in current and
potential member countries for consideration before the 1996 review of the
Maastricht Treaty.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, 'Why the FT knows its school tables' read the headline of John Authers'
article on school examination league tables on November 20. This being the
FT, the headline suggests one should expect a sophisticated analysis.
Some sophistication]
As far as this school was concerned, the article was ignorant about our
catchment area and assumed, amazingly, that the cohort from which our
A-level candidates was drawn was the same as for GCSE. A telephone call to
the LEA or to me would have indicated that this school serves a far wider
catchment than 'the plum academic area in north Oxford' and that its 1993
A-level candidates included 25 per cent who joined us at 16+ from other
schools. To compare our A-level results favourably with our GCSE ones and
conclude that our GCSE results are 'distinctly mediocre' displays distinctly
mediocre powers of analysis.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: British manufacturing far short of
world class
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr MICHAEL CROSS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Over the past two to three years, I and a number of colleagues in the
US and Japan have compiled an analysis of 'world-class' manufacturing
operations.
We used the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award criteria as a means of
defining world class, and any operations scoring more than 900 we called
world class. In all, we considered just over 12,000 operations and managed
to identify 1,039 operations scoring more than 900 on the Baldrige Scale.
The results show that Japan has 675 world-class manufacturing operations,
North America has 221, west Germany 71, Britain 40 and France 32.
When the number of operations are split by location, the result is revealing
about local circumstances. Of the Japanese-owned operations, 510 are in
Japan; for North American-owned operations, 113 are in North America. For
both the German and French operations the bulk are in their home countries,
with 67 and 29 respectively. Yet for the British operations, 34 are located
outside the UK.
I think we have a long way to go if the UK manufacturing base is to become
world class.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Wheel of fortune wobbles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Opinion polls showing the government at a nadir of popularity and the
official opposition at a peak tell us nothing. If the published numbers have
any meaning, it is surely that the Labour party has only one way to go:
down. That being the case, the Conservatives can expect to recover some of
the support they have lost since April 1992. This supposition works if you
believe in the Great Wheel of Fate theory of alternating poll leads for the
two tired old parties.
I suspect that Mr John Smith puts his faith in another Big Wheel, the one
that determines which party shall govern. The Labour leader acts as if this
mechanism exists to give every Buggins his turn, if only he waits. Watch
him. You would think that all he has to do is sit tight with his deputy, Mrs
Margaret Beckett, in their little swing chair. When the time comes, they
have merely to close their eyes, lean back and enjoy the inevitable whoosh
to the heights of power. From the top of the Wheel they may peer down on Mr
John Major, by then an ex-prime minister, walking disconsolately into
retirement.
Mr Smith would do well to note the wealth warning imposed on the financial
services industry. Past performance is no guide to future outcomes. Labour
has come back from nowhere before, but cannot be sure that it will do so
again. Much depends upon what Mr Smith himself does. Merely positioning his
party against the day when the Tories fall may not be sufficient.
You could forgive the Labour leader for taking a more sanguine view. Since
the collapse of communism, electorates in many countries have turned against
sitting governments. In the past few months voters have badly frightened the
prime minister of New Zealand and nearly exterminated Canada's Progressive
Conservatives. Italians have rejected their traditional political parties.
Russian voters showed at the weekend that they can be as cussed as the rest
of us. It is also true that if ever a government deserved to be thrown out,
it is the one we have. Britain's Conservative administration looks less like
a discredited rabble today than it did before the Budget, but not much less.
No party leader, least of all Mr Smith, would be foolish enough to assume
that the Tories will remain in so sorry a state right through until a
general election in, say, 1996. The correct supposition for any grown-up
strategist must be that economic recovery plus a closing of the Conservative
ranks will win back much of the support lost by the government since April
1992. Labour cannot afford to bask in its present deceptive popularity. It
has to address itself to what will doubtless be a far less propitious
political marketplace of the future. So far, Mr Smith has done little to
instill confidence that he knows how to do this.
Yet the contrary argument - that the party must simply keep itself united,
stay out of trouble, and pace itself properly - has some merit. Reasonably,
the Labour leader has devoted much of his first 16 1/2 months in his new job
to internal housekeeping. So far the net result of this has been a
disappointingly small reduction in the influence of trade unions, bought at
a high price in political pledges. At the same time, Mr Smith has embraced
wholesale constitutional reform, while kicking the electoral system into
touch by offering a referendum. He has at least managed to prevent a party
split over proportional representation. As to Europe, Labour played with
parliamentary fire during the Maastricht ratification debates, and might
have scuppered the bill. Yet today the opposition looks nearer to the heart
of continental affairs than do the Tories. When he approaches the European
Union, Mr Major walks on thin glass.
At the same time, Mr Smith has paid due attention to day-to-day tactics.
Labour is properly devoting much energy to reminding us that the Tories'
low-tax election campaign of last year was a swindle. This week Mr Smith has
withdrawn co-operation over the conduct of parliamentary business. This is a
justifiable response to the government's rash attempt to rush the
privatisation of sick pay and the increase in national insurance through the
Commons. Perhaps Mr Major thinks everyone is too busy Christmas shopping to
notice. Stories of MPs kept late on these matters might help spread the
message that paying more national insurance is the same as paying more
income tax, only less fair.
The test for the Labour leader comes next year, the 50th anniversary of the
1944 white paper on full employment. Mr Smith has already committed his
party to that half-century-old aspiration, without producing a convincing
plan on how to meet it. He is more at ease with the Keynesian Delors plan to
manufacture employment within the EU than was the government last week. An
OECD report on the subject, due next June, is as likely as not to be
critical of flexible employment policies that end in wholesale
casualisation, the creation of mere MacJobs. There is a painful nerve of
middle-class insecurity here, waiting for a canny political touch.
Late next summer we will also see the publication of the findings of the
Commission on Social Justice, set up by Mr Smith when he became leader.
Under Sir Gordon Borrie, the commission aims to redefine the welfare state
according to contemporary conditions of life, just over half a century since
Beveridge's first attempt. This is a higher-sounding aim than that of the
government, whose long-term review of social security is intended to cut
costs. Yet a Labour left conference has attacked the commission's findings
in advance of their preparation. This was done in the presence of Messrs
Bill Morris and John Edmonds, a pair of disappointed trade union bigwigs who
have found Mr Smith less malleable than they would like. One of the
commission's working papers, published yesterday, sets out options for
changing child benefit. The left won't like that.
The Labour leader should remember that a row - call it a vigorous debate -
on these matters is probably the best way of attracting public attention to
changed thinking. If/when the Smith Labour party has something new and
attractive to say, it had better forget about Scottish caution, shut its
eyes to the temporary blips in the polls, and say it. That way, it might
carry conviction, and possibly even win an election.

<TEXT>
Sir, It is a little depressing, even if inevitable, that all those whom you
have appointed Minister for a Day have sought to increase the budget and the
power of their ministries.
Perhaps you should balance each future appointment by offering a column to
the day's chief secretary to the treasury.
He could set out the case that people should be free to lead their own lives
without the interference and tax demands of the ministry.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Merger to raise Kent's industrial
development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL SABIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I noted with interest the article entitled 'Tecs set for bigger
industrial policy role' (December 6) by David Goodhart. He is right to
observe that the greater role in deciding regional industrial policy given
Tecs is a significant move. In Kent we believe that this is an exciting
opportunity to enhance and improve training and economic development
services in a county undergoing considerable change.
But I am concerned by your statement that in Kent the Tec will 'take over
the economic development activities of the Kent County Council'. This is not
the case. This is a merger between two organisations concerned with economic
development. As a result a new organisation will be created, building on the
strengths of the existing bodies. It is important that the business
community perceives something new and value added, rather than a bolt-on to
those that currently exist.
Like you, we believe that it may be a template to help shape the formation
of organisations elsewhere in the UK.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: A comic insight on bio-piracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr P A LEONARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I would like to share an anecdote on the issues around the protection
of pharmaceutical inventions through the Gatt (' 'Bio-piracy' under new
fire', November 30).
When a child, my two brothers and I were given one penny for each year of
our ages to spend on sweets each week. My elder brother also bought a comic
with this money, which cost him three of his 10 pence. My younger brother
and I were happy with this arrangement, since we spent all our money on
sweets and read his comic once he had. This did not seem fair, and my elder
brother soon stopped buying a comic - much to our disappointment. Finally,
we agreed we would each donate a penny for the shared comic and the problem
was solved.
The pharmaceutical industries of Canada, Egypt, India and 13 Latin American
countries you identified as opposing the obligatory protection of
pharmaceutical patents in the Gatt, want us to buy the comic for them to
read. The 'comic' is, of course, the investment in research and development
which innovative pharmaceutical companies must make to improve health care.
If these companies stop buying the comic, they go out of business. The
patent system will not stop anybody reading the comic, it will merely make
them wait a while, until the innovative pharmaceutical industry has prepared
the next issue.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Challenge of peacekeeping: A possible framework for
co-operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOUGLAS HURD and ANDREI KOZYREV
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The international community is starting to look beyond the conflict in the
former Yugoslavia, and is becoming increasingly aware of the true magnitude
and seriousness of ethnic and political conflicts in the former Soviet
Union. The problem is indeed a pressing one.
The disputes in the Transcaucasus, central Asia, and elsewhere in the former
Soviet Union are causing great suffering for those involved. They are a
source of legitimate concern to the Russians, who are worried by clashes
close to their borders. They are concerned too about the safety of ethnic
Russians living in those countries where there are conflicts, and about the
economic and social consequences of refugees fleeing to Russia (whose
potential number is estimated at more than 2m).
They believe that the problems in some of the former Soviet republics are
either ignored or misunderstood. The Russians fear that if they do nothing,
the conflicts will worsen and probably spread. They argue that they have a
legitimate concern in trying to resolve conflicts that threaten their
security. They ask why, when the international community is engaged in
peacemaking and peacekeeping in many of the world's trouble spots, similar
efforts should not be undertaken in the hot spots near them.
Equally, these disputes are of legitimate concern to Britain, its western
partners and the whole international community, both for humanitarian
reasons and because such flashpoints risk provoking regional instability. If
uncontrolled, they pose a variety of threats to European security, including
increased traffic in drugs and arms as well as international terrorism.
Crises in Russia's newly independent neighbours may also complicate Russia's
relations with the west: unless they are carefully handled, they risk
prejudicing the emerging relationship between us.
The west is sometimes suspicious of Moscow's attitude. There are no
differences about the need to resolve these conflicts: but there are
differences over how to go about it. The British government will not
underwrite Russian involvement unless it is sure that peacekeeping troops
will not turn into occupying forces. Nor are countries that secured their
independence when the Soviet Union was dissolved keen that the west should
concede to Moscow the same role it played in the Soviet empire. They fear
that this would compromise their sovereignty. When they are willing for
Russian troops to play a peacekeeping role, they want there to be some form
of international monitoring. This has meant that, even though the west lacks
the resources to engage directly in those trouble spots, it has been wary of
appearing to endorse Russian involvement instead, in case it had imperial
tendencies.
If we are to fashion a joint approach by Russia and its western partners to
the problem of peacekeeping in the former Soviet Union, we must address all
these concerns. Clearly Russia has an important role to play in this area.
If the Russians want international recognition and more active support from
the international community, the west in turn needs guarantees that Russia
will not regard recognition of its involvement as giving it carte blanche in
the former Soviet Union. Peace-keeping in the former Soviet Union, as indeed
peacekeeping elsewhere, must comply with internationally recognised
principles. It needs to be looked at on a case by case basis. Respect for
the sovereignty of the newly independent countries must remain paramount.
We agreed that the principles underlying Russian, CIS or international
peacekeeping operations would need to include: strict respect for the
sovereignty of the countries involved; an invitation from the government
concerned and the consent of the parties to the conflict; commitment to a
parallel political peace process; a clear mandate setting out the role of
the peacekeeping forces (which should whenever possible be multinational in
character); and an exit strategy for the peacekeeping forces deployed.
These principles should help stimulate a dialogue and political settlement
between the parties to the conflict, focus attention and, where possible,
resources on the settlement of conflicts in the former Soviet Union.
All this will help enhance Russian peacekeeping practices. Although the
Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the UN lack the
resources to put large numbers of peacekeepers on the ground themselves,
they may be able to suggest measures to enhance transparency and to monitor
the peace process. Extending co-operation within the North Atlantic
Co-operation Council, and also co-operation between Russia and Nato, might
help improve training for Russian peacekeepers. This is an area we shall
need to explore further.
We also need to put much more emphasis on preventive diplomacy. One of the
ways in which we can help prevent conflicts is to strengthen the democratic
institutions in the newly independent countries of the former Soviet Union.
The CSCE and other international institutions can play an important role
here, drawing the newly independent countries into a more active dialogue on
ways of promoting democratic values and principles. We discussed ways of
strengthening the CSCE's role, including the role of the High Commissioner
for National Minorities, at the recent Rome ministerial meeting.
We must try to find ways of managing and resolving tensions before they
erupt into conflict. It will not be easy, but we must try. Potentially
explosive cocktails of ethnic and political animosities could spread the
fire of intolerance all too easily to other countries and regions.
We need to deal with it together in the spirit of partnership. And we need
to deal with it urgently. Our security is indivisible and we must ensure it
by vigorous and imaginative efforts aimed at promoting peace for all as well
as rights for all.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Arts: Little Red Riding Hood - Pantomime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pantomime season at The Theatre Royal, Stratford East kicks off with
Little Red Riding Hood which has picked up The Three Little Pigs somewhere
on the way to granny's house in the forest. This is a traditional, enjoyable
and, at two hours flat, a child-friendly panto: no lewdness and only a bit
of cartoon violence. But it is still short of the laugh riot it could be.
The amalgam of characters includes a Wolf in the Noel Coward lupine mould,
all furry fury plus smoking jacket, lisp ('Wed Widing Hood'), an occasional
song and an overall excuse: 'Ah, it was a kwhy for help.' Then there is
Nigel the Woosterish woodsman hewing down the forest in plus fours and
weilding the axe like a sand iron; he is the love interest for Red, and
sings a parody of Luther Vandross so good that the object of his desires
notices, 'You've been eating those mushrooms again . . . Maybe we could be
pen friends'. Red herself is formidable in a gingham tablecloth of a dress
alongside her father who seems to have clothed himself in chessboards.
Of course there is an apple-cheeked granny, some crackling good porky
piggies who manage a fine trotter jive, a couple of wandering Cockney
'barrah persons' and a Liverpudlian dog which needs bolstering with a
special 'Bravery song' from the audience. The opposition are the Wicked
Witch (who turns out to be Red's long lost abducted mother) and her sidekick
Earwax who are, luckily, powerless beyond the storybook forest set.
The panto comes alive when the characters turn to the audience. They ask
what is going on, or taunt them, or in the Wolf's case, are blown off stage
by them. The music (Anthony Ingle) keeps the atmosphere going, especially
with a louche Wolf theme in the tracks of Henry Mancini's 'Panther' and a
good James Brown number for the Witches. The script is spattered with
gobbets of Shakespeare, Hollywood ('The company of wolves') and pop
reference ('I'm too sexy for my fur' says the Wolf).
The actors seem to enjoy the evening, especially when they have something to
work with and react to. The first casualty on the audience side was an
infant escorted away mewling and puking for an early bath after five minutes
of the first half; but happily she was the only dissenter in an evening of
genial warmth and good spirits. Jeff Teare Directs.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Arts: Classical in question - Exhibitions in Leeds and
Halifax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A visit to the handsome public galleries of Leeds this December or January
can be recommended as offering stimulating food for thought. The Henry Moore
Institute ends this year and begins the the next showing the work of four
European sculptors, and is also, at its sculpture studios at Dean Clough in
Halifax, offering the opportunity to experience one of the more experimental
works of the American artist James Turrell.
Those who wish to see Gas Works: A Ganzfeld Sphere - a chamber in which one
viewer at a time is exposed to the effects of red and blue neon and white
strobe lights - must act quickly; it closes on December 20. The sphere
offers not so much an aesthetic experience as a lesson in perception - the
changing colours and psychedelic patterns experienced inside are created not
on its smooth white dome but on the retina of the beholder, as each
individual reacts to the flashing lights. It also offers an insight into the
kind of obsessive interests (Turrell plans to revisit the piece at the end
of the show to continue his light experiments) which can eventually bring
about completely realised works of art.
The four works in the show at the Henry Moore Institute are all very
different: two have been made especially for the exhibition, two have not.
'Sea of Sun,' a maze of metal chains created by the English artist Andrew
Sabin, was first exhibited at the end of 1992 at the Battersea Arts Centre
in London. The effect of pushing through the series of rectangles he has
created from hanging painted steel chains is indeed like plunging into sun
dappled water, the coloured images, visible through each other, ever
shifting and never quite resolved. Some of the chain screens are covered
with abstract patterns, some with single faces, some with buildings or
landscapes. Viewing them is rather like recalling a dream, trying to catch
hold of that one half-remembered scene which will unlock the meaning of all
the rest.
The Spanish sculptor Jaume Pensa likes his metal traditional, although with
a post modern twist. He has used iron casts of iron-casting buckets as the
unit of construction of 'La Neige Rouge', 1991, a hollow rectangle made from
one hundred buckets piled up and facing inward. The lips of the buckets are
threaded with orange neon elements. Standing inside the rectangle in the
buzzing orange glow is like standing inside heat, being made molten by
colour alone.
Vittorio Messina, originally trained as an architect in Rome, made 'Confini
d'Occidente', 1993, especially for the exhibition. Using only ready made
industrial materials - breeze blocks, neon strips, pieces of wood,
carpeting, metal shelves, sanitary ware and an anatomical skeleton - he has
created a shabby temple, its structure and form recalling the classical
monuments of ancient Greece. Their reprise in these humdrum materials sets
off a dialectic between the forms of the past which we so revere and the
utilitarian functions of ordinary buildings, so often reviled. Being forced
to look at these brutal staples of our everyday lives, assembled in a manner
which consciously evokes the past, serves to remind us that history is made
now, too, in similarly unprepossessing settings, even when, as busy
participants, we fail to notice.
'Fallen Cornice', 1993, by Edward Allington, the present Gregory Fellow in
creative art at the University of Leeds, also questions the classical past
which still so informs our present attitude to art and architecture. Made
for a room at the Institute which retains the proportions of the original
merchants' offices, the eponymous cornice, recreated larger than life in
copper lies on the floor. In its descent from the ceiling, it has dragged
with it some of the inner workings of the building, suggested by lengths of
armoured cabling trailing from the roof. Allington's work explores the
continuing role of classical convention in our mass produced present,
economically conveyed by such ironic displacements .
Herbert Read, the centenary of whose birth is celebrated by a marvellous
exhibition at the Institute's next door neighbour, the City Art Gallery,
throughout the 1920s also questioned the dominance of the classical,
Mediterranean tradition in our view of art, suggesting that it should be set
against the romanticism of Northern Europe to be fully understood. This
early position became typical of Read's dialectical approach in his writings
about art, and allowed him to defend both abstraction and Surrealism during
the 1930s, when their practitioners were at daggers drawn, and in the 1950s
to accept the new precepts of abstract expressionism while still remaining
loyal to the naturalistically based work of Henry Moore and Barbara
Hepworth.
Only in his later years did his ability to accept and understand the new
begin to fade. His famous dislike of Pop Art may perhaps be traced to the
socialist and anarchist views of his youth, formed during his years at Leeds
University from 1912 to 1914 when he was also a member of the radical Leeds
Arts Club. The Pop artists' blithe acceptance of the crude mechanics of
capitalist advertising he found hard to take. 'For him,' his son Ben, one of
the curators of the exhibition, told me, 'art was always very serious.'
Read's move to London in 1933 thrust him into middle of the progressive
artistic community then beginning to gather in Hampstead which formed the
bedrock of his aesthetic development. The exhibition's greatest success is
to celebrate Read's individual vision, so much the product of the
circumstances of his life. It is moving to see works by Hepworth or
Nicholson or Moore presented to Read in the course of their long friendship,
and touching to see his huge desk, made to his own design when he was
championing modernism to an unresponsive audience when briefly professor of
fine art at the University of Edinburgh (1931-33). This quiet Yorkshireman
could be not only a radical but a true internationalist, helping to bring a
sceptical England its first sightings of surrealism and abstract
expressionism and, eventually, worldwide recognition. His final lecture,
given in Cuba 1968, was on 'The Problems of Internationalism in Art.'
Not just a writer, lecturer and thinker, he also got things done; he was one
of the founders of the Institute of Contemporary Art in London, for example,
becoming its first chairman in 1947. He never shrank from the difficult
questions and spent his life discussing the role of art in what he believed
to be its proper place, the very heart of a society's political and social
development. That he could do so with such confidence, that he was also not
afraid to allow his views to develop, was perhaps because as a lifelong
writer of poetry the creative process was an intimate part of his own
experience, giving him the strength to remain true to his aesthetic
instincts.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Arts: 'I lombardi' with Pavarotti - Opera in New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is an odd Met season: the three new home-grown productions are all of
Verdi operas, two of which are early pieces the company has never staged
before. Six weeks ago there was Stiffelio; now comes a work to make that
opera seem a triumph of sober maturity and deep interest: the ramshackle
story of fraternal rivalry, changed allegiances, betrayal and baptism,
hermit and heroine, battles and blessings set among the Lombards at the
First Crusade.
Time and the critics have not been kind to I lombardi. It was the first
Verdi opera to be performed in America - in 1847, four years after its
introduction at La Scala - but then inevitably was rapidly overtaken by
later works, and Verdi himself seems to have hoped to hasten its burial by
recasting it, also in 1847, as Jerusalem. Julian Budden calls it 'an
agglomeration of heterogeneous ideas, some remarkable, some unbelievably
banal' - a judgment which the Met production cannot but sustain.
Beautifully modulated responses to Bellinian cantabile flow up against the
blocky contours of trivial choruses; fine orchestral moments - some of them
very fine indeed, and exquisitely played under James Levine - exist
alongside raucous march tunes. There is the feeling of a sensibility at war
with itself, which may be the composer's response to the bellicose subject
matter, but which may also be the flailing of a young artist beginning to
gain possession of his talents but not yet certain how to use them.
The result is conspicuous wastefulness. I lombardi is almost baroque in its
scenic demands, requiring at least ten different sets and several costume
changes for the chorus. Happily these are areas in which the Met excels.
John Conklin, the set designer, provides a useful unity and grandness of
image by keeping a row of great gold-panelled doors along each side of the
stage, and his conjurings of the different locales are quick, emblematic and
strong: a Romanesque arcade and rose window for the basilica of the first
scene, Moorish arches for the tyrant of Antioch's palace, a painted
landscape for the River Jordan, a cyclorama of mustard light for the desert.
Dunya Ramicova's costumes are also simple and colourful - especially the
patterned robes of the Antiochans and the copper armour of the crusaders.
Nowhere, rightly, is there much effort at historical accuracy: these are
broad, modern reactions to the 19th century reacting to the 11th.
I lombardi is also wasteful in its treatment of minor characters. Viclinda,
cause of the dispute between the brothers, sings briefly in the first scene;
by the next act her daughter is praying to her spirit, without anyone having
bothered to tell us she had died. The tyrant of Antioch has his hot moment
at the start of that act, goes off almost at once to fight the invaders, and
returns as a corpse. Sofia, his wife, appears in just one scene, where her
sole function is to serve as an admiring audience for her son, Oronte.
Since this is Luciano Pavarotti's role, she acts as the embodiment of the
entire house - or certainly did so on the opening night, when Pavarotti was
at his most mellifluous and persuasive in this mama's boy aria. His tone was
unfailingly sweet, his comportment of the voice between registers assured,
and his decoration nimbly executed without disturbance to the line. This was
artistry. Sadly,he slackened his care and attention in his later scenes,
though there were excuses for that. In his love duet with the Christian
Giselda he had to hold to his line - and he did - against Aprile Millo's
disturbing mistunings (and she was as zealous in holding to her
quarter-tones). In his reappearance from the dead, the absurdity, together
with his backward placement on the stage, may have been responsible for
encouraging a more uniform, and uniformly loud, treatment.
Samuel Ramey, as Pagano, was more consistent in his singing, and in his
vivid presence: he alone on stage conveyed the impression he thought he was
in something that mattered. And he did so despite the fact that the piece
required him to present not one character but two, with no opportunity for
developing one out of the other.
In the first act Pagano is naked villain: Ramey aptly and ably used that
bark, particularly on long 'a' sounds, that he can produce without damage to
his melody. In the following three acts, where the move to the Holy Land
finds the wicked brother become a sombre eremite, he softened in tone, but
not in power. Even when prayerful and subdued, he was in command. The
honours belonged to him, to Pavarotti in his first aria, and to Levine and
the orchestra, whose leader, Raymond Gniewek, played decorously in the
violin concerto which underlies the whole last scene of the third act.
Bruno Beccaria was stark as the good brother Arvino. Anthony Laciura made
startling use of his high tenor as the Milanese grandee who comes rushing
into the opening scene with news of the coming crusade: Mark Lamos's
production'otherwise neutral, except in some regrettable choreographing of
the chorus'made him look like a Russian holy fool, which was effective. The
production remains in repertory until January 20, though Ramey leaves it
after Christmas.

In the last of the current run of BBC2's often excellent foreign affairs
series, Assignment, (7.45) Vincent Hanna investigates the way in which
Germany and other EU countries have, as he puts it, 'quietly agreed to amend
their immigration and asylum laws to make it administratively impossible for
people to seek political asylum in the Community unless they are rich or
well connected'.
Even worse refugee stories featured in the first episode of Robert Fisk's
series about the development of Moslem fundamentalism, From Beirut To
Bosnia. Today Fisk visits Gaza to talk to members of the 'Hamas' group and
to Palestinians and Israelis. Fisk's main motivation seems to be the
(probably correct) belief that practically no one in the UK cares about the
feelings of fundamentalists in the Middle East (9.00 C4).
Ironic that the BBC should announce now that they are scrapping 40 Minutes,
just when it has returned to form. Today's programme is about a group of
London entrepreneurs who went to Moscow to open up the market (9.40 BBC2).

FT  14 DEC 93 / Arts: 'Ritual Fragment', Mahler's Tenth - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Sunday Mark Wigglesworth conducted the London Philharmonic - except in
Harrison Birtwistle's Ritual Fragment, which needs no conductor. That was
one of the many elegies, or 'in memoriams', composed for the late Michael
Vyner, artistic director of the
London Sinfonietta, and it has worn well. All of the performers whose
instruments are portable take their turns at a central music-stand, one by
one, laying their own melodic wreaths over soft background commentary and
funereal thwacks on a bass drum.
If the LPO players are less used than the Sinfonietta team to playing while
processing, they went through their paces with unruffled gravity. The piece
wrought its proper spell. Birtwistle is now the LPO's 'composer in
residence', and the Ritual Fragment had been used in an Education Project.
Before the concert proper, we heard three school groups delivering
pre-improvised music inspired by it - or so we were told: except for one
excursion into jazz, it seemed shapeless stuff. Birtwistle's ideas are
inimitable, least of all by children.
In Mozart's Sinfonia Concertante K364, the great violin-and-viola one, there
was no special creative input from the orchestra, though Wigglesworth
handled it with an agreeably light touch. That was enough, for Thomas
Zehetmair and Tabea Zimmermann were a winning pair of soloists, his subtle,
fine-drawn line beautifully answered by her broad, mellifluous tone. Their
partnership was seamless; probably it hardly matters to them what the
accompanying orchestra does, as long as it doesn't get in the way.
As his own showpiece, however, Wigglesworth had chosen the Tenth Symphony of
Mahler, in Deryck Cooke's reconstruction. It sounded well-studied, at least
 -indeed, it might have served as a kind of study-performance: all the notes
were there, efficiently regimented and clear. There was nothing else to
recommend it.
Rigor mortis set in almost from the start, with the conductor's
extraordinarily unyielding tempi denying Mahler's long, anguished lines any
room to breathe. New thematic material arrived as if on a conveyor belt,
with no sense of event or fresh feeling. As an experiment in playing Mahler
without expressive, idiomatic rubato, one hopes never to hear it repeated.
Even the scherzo-movements were stiff, and the Adagios at the start and the
close were frigid.
The famous outcries were loud, but empty of dramatic force. Surely it must
be a mistake for any conductor to essay this fragmented Tenth before
mastering a lot of earlier Mahler? It made a weirdly dispiriting experience.

Unilever executive director Charles Miller Smith, who was in the running for
the chief executive's job at Barclays Bank, has finally found a seat in a
clearing bank boardroom. He has been appointed a non-executive director of
Midland Bank, the UK arm of HSBC Holdings.
Miller Smith, 54, is a main board director of Unilever where he has
executive responsibility for food activities in Southern Europe. He is
thought to be one of the two front-runners to take over the chairmanship of
the British arm of Unilever when the current incumbent, Mike Perry, retires
in about three years' time.
Miller Smith, who is also a non-executive director of ICI, replaces Charles
Mackay, chief executive of Inchcape, who joined the Midland board in
November 1992. Mackay, 53, will continue as a non-executive director of
Midland's parent HSBC Holdings.
Meanwhile, John Skae, 57, Midland's company secretary since 1985, retires at
the end of the year. Ralph Barber, 42, HSBC's company secretary, will assume
the additional responsibility as company secretary of Midland Bank.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Business and the Law: Benefits of the Bar's broken monopoly
 -The effects of last week's decision to extend rights of audience in the
High Court to solicitors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has taken almost 15 years of pressure and wrangling but the Bar's
200-year monopoly on advocacy in the higher courts has finally been broken.
Last week, Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, and England's four most senior
judges approved the Law Society's application for wider rights for
solicitors in private practice in England and Wales. The move will allow
solicitors to represent their clients in court - at present they are
confined to magistrates' court and county court advocacy.
The big City law firms have been quietly getting ready for High Court
advocacy, and the decision marks the start of an intense period of training
to prepare advocates for the challenge. It also puts an end to the
increasingly redundant notion that solicitors are mere general practitioners
and that it is barristers who are the true specialists.
The decision also represents a personal triumph for Lord Mackay. Rights of
audience for solicitors formed the central plank of what he had promised in
1989 would be 'the biggest shake-up of the legal profession this century'.
The shake-up has taken longer than he hoped, but he has survived the
hyperbole and at times intense hostility to his plans from the Bar and
judiciary. Whatever the Bar may say, this one measure will, over time,
change the practice of law in England and Wales irrevocably.
But perhaps those with the biggest cause to celebrate are the clients,
particularly international clients of City law firms, many of whom have
never understood why the person who knows their case backwards has to hand
it over to someone else to present in court.
Mr David Fraser, a litigation partner of Baker &amp; McKenzie, the world's
biggest law firm, says US clients accept the English system (there is an
element of a two-tier system in the US), but there is a resistance to paying
for an outsider to enter the loop at a late stage.
In future clients should benefit from a reduction in the cost of litigating,
and from greater choice and flexibility in the way their cases are handled.
This can only boost London's position as a centre of commercial litigation
and increase the already significant contribution of more than Pounds 400m
which international commercial litigation makes to Britain's invisible
earnings.
Mr John Trotter, a senior litigation partner at City solicitors Lovell White
Durrant, says the cost savings will depend on the nature of the individual
case.
If there remains a need for someone to take the solicitor's traditional role
of back-up and support to counsel, the savings from having a solicitor as
opposed to a barrister doing the advocacy may not be large. The main savings
are likely to come from not having to inform counsel about a case at a late
stage and from avoiding the Bar's 'brief fee' system, he says.
At present barristers' fees for a case are made up of a 'brief fee', a form
of retainer for taking on a case, and a daily fee or 'refresher', for each
day spent in court.
For a commercial trial estimated to last four weeks, the brief fee could be
as much as Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 40,000. If the case settles after two
days, the barrister loses only the daily refresher.
The Bar's justification for this system is that barristers have to be paid
for preparatory work carried out on a case and for the the time blocked out
in their diaries for the possible duration of the case. If a case settles
after two days, the barrister could be left twiddling his thumbs for three
and a half weeks.
Commercial clients will not agree to pay solicitor advocates a brief fee,
says Mr Trotter. The advocacy element of the case will be charged on a time
basis, so that, if the case settles after two days, the client will only pay
for two days. This should produce substantial savings, he says.
The Bar says that using solicitor advocates will be more, rather than less,
expensive. It believes that solicitors' considerably higher overheads will
make it impossible for them to compete on cost.
This is one of the main reason's why the Commercial Bar, in particular, is
not overly concerned by solicitors gaining rights of audience.
Mr Julian Wilson, a litigation partner at City solicitors Herbert Smith,
believes solicitors can compete effectively on cost in spite of higher
overheads.
First, cost savings can be made by removing the duplication of effort in
briefing a barrister. Second, solicitors are now more competitive on price -
the recession has put enormous downward pressure on solicitors' fees, which
the Commercial Bar has been sheltered from.
Most solicitors agree, however, that solicitor advocates will not appear in
the High Court overnight. It will be an evolutionary process, because of the
hoops they must jump through to qualify for a High Court advocacy
certificate.
Solicitors will have to show a degree of 'relevant' advocacy experience. The
big unknown is how the Law Society will interpret the rules about what is
and what is not relevant experience.
At the moment the rules suggest that experience in arbitrations and before
tribunals, applications before a judge in chambers, and experience gained in
the High Court instructing and working with barristers will all count.
The rules also suggest solicitors will have to show experience of formal
advocacy in court. This is likely to mean advocacy in the county court,
where solicitors already have automatic rights of audience. This could
present a problem for City law firms, because they do not do much county
court work.
The irony, says Mr Wilson, is that under the rules as they stand the
high-street solicitors who do the vast bulk of county court advocacy work
and may not want to do High Court advocacy will find it easier to qualify
for a High Court advocacy certificate than solicitors with the most
experience of the High Court.
Mr Wilson hopes that in county court cases, where high-street solicitors
would normally brief a barrister, they will in future refer county court
advocacy work to City law firms.
The resulting increased competition for county court advocacy would benefit
clients by leading to improvements in efficiency and lower prices.
There are plans to set up a commercial county court for central London next
summer with a jurisdiction of Pounds 50,000 - until July 1991, claims above
Pounds 5,000 went to the High Court. The new London commercial county court
would provide a valuable training ground for the City firms.
The firms are under no illusions, however. They know that gaining enough
county court work for their solicitor advocates will be difficult,
particularly if, as Mr Trotter points out, each solicitor has to show
experience of 20-25 court appearances a year for two years to obtain the
certificate.
In spite of these obstacles, the big City firms are determined to train
their solicitors to become advocates to offer clients a modern, all-round
commercial litigation service.
How much High Court advocacy do they expect to do? Mr Wilson would not like
to hazard a guess, but it will be many years before the majority of Herbert
Smith's advocacy requirements can be met in-house, he says.
Mr Trotter is also reluctant to be drawn, but would not be surprised if, in
10 years, Lovells is doing between 30-50 per cent of its own High Court
advocacy.
So it seems there will always be a need for a Commercial Bar, albeit a
slimmed-down one.
The problem for the Bar is that its training ground for the next generation
of barristers appears to be rapidly disappearing. City solicitors doing
county court work and high-street solicitors beginning to compete for Crown
Court advocacy will mean less work for junior barristers to cut their teeth
on.
And if Crown Prosecution Service lawyers get the right to prosecute in Crown
Court trials, there may no longer be enough work for junior barristers to
enable the independent Bar to survive.

FT  14 DEC 93 / People: Herbert retires from Tussauds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Michael Herbert, who joined the Madame Tussaud's waxworks when there were
still Tussauds in the business, is retiring after 18 years as chief
executive of Tussauds, which is part of Pearson, owner of the Financial
Times.
Herbert, who will retire on April 30 1994 at the age of 60, has overseen
Tussauds' growth into the UK's leading commercial operator of leisure
attractions visited by over 8m visitors a year.
Apart from Madame Tussaud's, the group now includes Alton Towers and Warwick
Castle which rank among the UK's top ten visitor attractions.
When Herbert joined Tussauds in 1967, as its first accountant, it was an
'unfashionable little public company' chaired by Reuters' Sir Christopher
Chancellor. It had poor financial controls, was visited by 1m people a year,
and was suffering from fierce competition from rival attractions such as the
London Zoo.
Herbert took over as finance director in 1971 and the group was trying to
buy Chessington Zoo from a subsidiary of Pearson when it found itself the
subject of a contested bid battle from Lew Grade, the television impresario.
Pearson won the day in 1978 and Herbert stayed on as chief executive.
One of the keys to Tussauds' success is that it has never made any attempt
to call itself a museum. 'We are in the entertainment business,' says
Herbert, who believes that this approach has helped Madame Tussaud's, in
particular, survive periodic threats from rival attractions ranging from the
advent of cinema to the hologram.
He will be succeeded by Michael Jolly, 41, Tussauds' chief operating
officer, who joined the group in 1983 after working on the marketing side of
Cadbury Schweppes.

FT  14 DEC 93 / People: Miller/Williams five-year partnership comes to an
end
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Miller, finance director of paper and packaging group David S. Smith,
is leaving in mid January after the interim results, ending a five year
'partnership' with Canadian-born chief executive Peter Williams.
Miller, 45, played down the reasons for his departure. 'It is a great job
here, and it is very difficult to explain why you do something like this
without sounding smug, but occasionally you wake up in the morning and
realise how ignorant you are. I'd just like a change.'
He feels he has helped change the company 'mostly for the good', and thinks
it is 'a safe time to leave'. He stresses there is no falling out with
Williams.
For his part, Williams acknowledges that it is 'a surprise when someone as
young as John decides to move on' but goes on to stress that 'there was no
corporate reason. I guess if you decide your backswing is rusty and you
value that . . .'.
This is the third job in which Miller has worked closely with Williams. Both
men had been veterans of Reed International, Miller since 1974, shortly
after qualifying as a chartered accountant. He began reporting directly to
Williams from 1987, as finance director of the European manufacturing
division.
Shortly thereafter, Williams led the management buy-out of Reedpack, the
paper and packaging businesses of Reed, which was then sold on to Swedish
Svenska Cellulosa, at a handsome profit, in 1990. Miller joined him as
Reedpack's finance director, picking up around an estimated Pounds 2m from
the proceeds of the buy-out.
He is replaced at David S. Smith by David Buttfield, the financial
controller, also a Reedpack man. 'I want to make clear this is not just jobs
for the Reedpack boys,' says Miller. 'We did do a proper outside search.'
Meanwhile, the outgoing finance director has yet to decide how to repair his
'ignorance', but would consider anything from 'positions elsewhere in
industry not necessarily as finance director' to spending a year studying
fine art at the Courtauld Institute.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Business and the Law: Not a matter for national discretion -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Medicines Directive leaves no discretion to member countries
when deciding whether to suspend or withdraw a particular product, the
European Court of Justice ruled last week.
The decision was made on a preliminary reference from the Italian State
Council. The Italian health minister had declared authorisations for certain
medicinal products invalid under an Italian law, which allowed him to do so
when products authorised for sale were not put on the market within 18
months.
Under European law, medicinal products are subject to a number of directives
aimed at progressively establishing free movement of such goods throughout
the European Community, while ensuring public health is protected. The
directives lay down rules on public health grounds for the suspension or
withdrawal of authorisations for such products. It is also clearly stated
that such rules are exhaustive.
The Court therefore had little difficulty in deciding that there was no
discretion which could be exercised by the national authorities in this
area.
The Court was also asked to rule whether a national law which allowed
authorisations to be declared invalid rather than suspended or withdrawn was
also contrary to European law.
The Italian government argued that declarations of invalidity were different
from measures of withdrawal or suspension and thus member states were not
limited in their use of the former by the terms of a directive which only
dealt with the latter.
The Court agreed that declarations of invalidity were different from
measures of withdrawal but held that their effect was the same - to annul an
existing authorisation. The Court also said that the present framework
established by the relevant directives would be affected if member states
were allowed to use ways of annulling authorisations other than those set
out in the directives.
C-83/92: Pierrel SpA v Ministero della Sanita, ECJ 5CH, December 7 1993.
Initiation of dumping review requires sufficient evidence
The European Commission must have sufficient evidence of the dumping of
goods and the injury caused before initiating a review of anti-dumping
measures, the European Court ruled last week.
The case related to the imposition of definitive anti-dumping duties on a
Brazilian exporter at the conclusion of a review. The problem arose because
in the original proceedings four years earlier, the Brazilian exporter had
been cleared of dumping.
The evidence which the Commission took into account when deciding to
initiate the review did not include evidence of dumping by that exporter.
The Commission argued that it was not necessary to adduce sufficient
evidence of dumping and injury before initiating review proceedings as the
original proceedings, for which such evidence was necessary, had not been
closed. All that was necessary was evidence of changed circumstances to
justify a review.
The Court said procedural rules for reviews made it clear that sufficient
evidence had to be adduced before initiating such proceedings. It then said,
however, it was not necessary for the evidence to relate to dumping on the
part of each of the undertakings concerned as anti-dumping proceedings
relate in principle to all imports of a certain category of products from a
third country, not to imports of products manufactured by specific
companies.
The Court said the Commission had relied on two pieces of evidence. First,
evidence provided by exporters who had been subject to anti-dumping duties
that their exports were no longer being dumped and that the Community
industry therefore no longer suffered material injury. Second, evidence that
there was overcapacity in the product market which had brought about a
substantial fall in prices in the Community.
The Court ruled that neither piece of evidence amounted to sufficient
evidence of dumping to justify a review.

<TEXT>
David Field, the AFC engineer, reminded me of the poor marine engineer who
appears in disaster films - up to his chest in water while the passengers
waltz on the deck above. Many of the systems he is using are obsolete. This
is bad news for everyone except a few contract programmers. They are able to
cash in on the rarity value of their skills and charge a premium - often
twice the going rate.
It is true that whatever decision you make about computer strategy could be
wrong. London Underground
chose Pick as the basis of its systems. At the time, it looked to have
advantages over systems such as Unix. Often, blind chance seems to decree
which will be the swan and which the turkey.
For this reason, companies must remain flexible in their IT strategy. Those
that declare that open systems are the only way forward may be left in the
wake of the Windows NT rush. Technicians are fond of declaring which is the
best operating system but that often has little to do with its success or
failure in the market.
I saw one chap at the Underground copying data manually from one screen to
another all day. The two
systems were unable to talk to each other. It was a depressing sight - human
beings were never meant for such drudgery. Planned enhancements to Divorced
will free him for more productive work.
The Underground seems plagued with such incompatibility - the old Romance
system passes data between two systems on magnetic tapes. The format used is
common to neither
system. One computer converts data into that format then the other converts
it back.
I feel that the benefits put forward are a long way from real management
information. While the old system was horrendous, the new one is in danger
of standing in isolation.
It is essential that any IT strategy embrace all the aims of the company
rather than taking a parochial view.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Technology: A revolutionary ticket to ride - Claire Gooding
looks at London Underground's new system for the management of fares in a
series on getting the most out of software / Software at Work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You can lie,' say the Underground posters, 'but your ticket can't'. The
magnetic strip on the back of the Tube ticket holds a wealth of information
used in Automatic Fare Collection (AFC). Often crumpled to the point of
extinction, the card is actually a vital engineering component in London
Underground's efforts to protect its revenue.
Fraud on the Tube is estimated at Pounds 30m annually. The ticket is not
just proof of a contract to travel: it can prove where and when in the
system you travelled. Already, it is used to claim refunds on delayed
journeys. In the future it could provide discounts and 'stored value'
credit.
Like the rest of the Underground, ticket technology is straitjacketed by the
legacy of the past, and every investment has to be viewed with an eye to the
future. This month, a new system goes into full operation which puts into
place the basis for future management of fares. Called Divorced (mostly
because the old system it replaces is known as Romance), it speeds up
financial reporting and provides the vital ticket-derived information used
in fraud detection. During tests it helped to estimate lost revenue during
the recent power cuts, including refunded fares for 20,000 delayed
travellers.
David Field, the AFC engineer for London Underground enjoys a challenge,
which is just as well. Keeping the Tube running on its worn-out tracks with
ancient trains and a dodgy power supply might be thought challenging enough.
'We have this undying belief that you can keep things working for 60 years
and more. And you can, if you spend money at the right time.'
Field specialises in introducing new technology into this scenario at
minimum cost and disruption. He is responsible for both the 'heavy metal'
end of AFC, the automatic ticket-vending machines, the gates themselves
(once dubbed 'Rottweilers'), and the hardware and software underpinning
them.
He sums up AFC's role succinctly. 'Reducing costs while improving service is
what we do - freeing money for other things.' In information technology, he
looks to spend the absolute minimum, and he wants 'building blocks' that
will contribute to future plans.
Field's customers are not those careless commuters who jam crumpled tickets
in his high-technology gates, but the accountants in the London Underground
revenue office. Automation started in 1964, with the first machine at Acton,
west London. Much of the equipment replaced by the gates originated in the
1920s, and it took until 1987 to complete the process. When Field came to
London Underground in 1985, the ticketing system was already specified and
he had to implement it.
Stations built in the last century cannot always be adapted for automatic
gating, but they can all be connected to a central computer, and most can
benefit from passenger-operated ticket issuing machines. These, and the
Ticket Office Machines (Toms) behind the counter are linked to a central
system which feeds real-time operational and maintenance systems as well as
revenue-tracking.
Field takes a global view of what is possible in public transport, fuelled
by his seven years' experience in the Hong Kong Mass Transit system, which
was built from scratch and completed in 1979. One of his dream tickets is
the idea of 'stored value' already used in Washington DC. A re-usable smart
card, resembling a credit card, could be recharged with cash, and
automatically debited on buses and taxis as well as the Tube. Field is only
too aware of the practical implications of extending such a system to the
entire transport network.
The project is currently out to tender and would need an investment of tens
of millions of pounds. Every station would need validation, and tickets
would need a machine-readable unique identifier, technically quite easy to
add to the current numbering system. Most of the information is already
there, partly because of information systems that have paved the way to
future developments.
'I managed to convince the management that a holistic approach was
essential,' says Field. 'It became obvious that, like everything else, the
computer system was wearing out.'
The target was to show revenue within 24 hours. But, as Field explains:
'Under the old system, if you buy your ticket at 9am on Monday, that doesn't
show on the revenue system until Wednesday morning. It concerned our
financial director that he couldn't reconcile what was banked with the
figures from the computer. And when we explained the security risks they
were taking, they were aghast.'
New computers installed for data collection provided some extra capacity.
This gave the AFC department a chance to put together software which would
not only upgrade the old revenue system with 24-hour reporting, but do some
'contingency planning'. This included catering for penalty fares - the
on-the-spot Pounds 10 fine planned for April 1994 - and line target
monitoring, which allows operational assessment of the ticket machines.
'We know penalty fares are coming along. We realised that much of the
management reporting, from both the engineering and operating viewpoint, was
not as efficient as it might be. People were using the PC route to get
around that, and transposing data, which is clumsy. The Divorced software
will eventually give us a seamless system.' Currently, the control centre -
into which the ticket-issuing machines report several times a minute - uses
an array of screens, and the controller has to retype log information from
one to another.
There were other considerations besides the revenue backlog. New requests
were becoming common, as Peter Cruickshank, the AFC software manager,
explains. 'There was a continuous flow of requests from the network planning
office about the types of ticket sold, and so on. The Romance system would
have needed major updates to cater for them.'
Cruickshank's previous experience with fourth-generation languages (4GL)
suggested that a 4GL might provide a low-cost solution. This would allow
flexibility for end users, and provide a platform for future developments.
Performance as well as ease of use was important. After rigorous
benchmarking, the AFC department selected PowerHouse, from Cognos. As ever,
the specification did not stand still: 'standard' reports mushroomed from 20
to 69, and new ideas were adopted during development.
A daily user of the system, and now manager of Divorced, end-user Mike
Dennis of the revenue office worked closely with the developers. His swift
demonstration shows how the system can now track the 700,000 daily ticket
sales, showing everything from the throughput of particular gates, to excess
fares, car-park takings and a detailed report on a ticket issued the day
before. 'It took six months to get to what we have now, and it does far more
than we originally specified.' That flexibility has been the main benefit of
using a 4GL,' says Dennis.
Apart from penalties and refunds, existing complex fares will become more
innovative, using timings and zonings for discounts. In effect, London
Underground has all the information in place for a revolutionary approach to
fares.
BUZZWORDS
PUBLIC OPERATED MACHINES (Poms) are automatic ticket-issuing machines which
include Few Fare Machines and Multi-Fare Machines. The Poms report
automatically to a control centre, which is monitored 24 hours a day.
TICKET OFFICE MACHINES (Toms) are operated by the clerk.
COMPANY SNAPSHOT
Nature of business: London Underground serves the London region with a
network of 273 stations, 10 lines and 254 miles of track, providing 2.5m
passenger journeys daily. Investment in new projects such as the Jubilee
Line extension to Docklands (Pounds 1.8bn) takes place against a struggle to
maintain an ageing infrastructure.
Employees: 17,000
Turnover: During 1992-93, income was Pounds 642m, with operating costs of
Pounds 621m. It has a lower investment by government than any other
underground railway in the world: Pounds 373m this year for the entire
London transport network including buses and Tube.
Key personnel: Dennis Tunnicliffe, managing director; Alan Watkins,
chairman; Nick Agnew, revenue support manager; David Field, AFC engineer;
Peter Cruickshank, AFC software manager.
TECHNOLOGY FILE
Software: The Divorced System was written in six months using the Cognos
fourth-generation language PowerHouse and Digital's Rdb database.  Explained
as Diverse Integration and Verification of Revenue Collection Electronic
Data, its name really derives from the Romance revenue system it replaces:
an application written in Pick Basic and running on two Fujitsu
minicomputers.  Rdb is used for the 'base data' on fares.
Hardware: The Fujitsus are being replaced by a two-node cluster of Digital
Equipment 4000/300 Vax minicomputers under the VMS operating system version
5.5. These were installed in July 1992 to upgrade the Data Gathering Centre,
which collects real-time data from stations.
Supplier:  Cognos, a US software house with a UK office in Bracknell won the
business on the basis of a benchmark race that included databases from
Oracle, Ingres and Digital, administered by an independent consultant,
Wokingham-based LSI.
Other Systems: Existing operational systems use a mixture of hardware
including old Digital PDP-11s, used for station simulation.  There is a
PDP-11 at most Tube stations: 274 installed at 248 stations, supporting
2,500 devices such as Poms and Toms (see Buzzwords), and the gates
themselves.
Cost: For the software alone the cost was Pounds 115,000 (with extra
hardware accounting for Pounds 75,000), the cheapest of all possible
solutions by about 30 per cent.
Development was done in-house by Peter Cruickshank's team.  Total project
cost is estimated at Pounds 360,000.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Management (The Growing Business): One-stop help shop -
Plans to speed up the development of a UK network of advice centres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Roger Stretch decided to buy some hi-tech laser machinery for his
family-owned metal working business, he realised he would need a Department
of Trade and Industry grant.
Casting aside a long-held suspicion of consultants, Stretch approached
Business Link Birmingham, which he was told had become a one-stop-shop
supplying advice and support to business.
'I am basically using the Business Link to sort out the paper work for me
and let me get on with running the business,' says Stretch, managing
director of Mackenzie Tools &amp; Production, a Birmingham-based metal working
company which employs 45 people.
Birmingham was the first of the Business Links to open its doors - quickly
followed by Leicester and Congleton - but the aim is to offer the service
throughout the UK. Within three years, the DTI hopes about 70 large and 130
smaller Business Links will be set up, all providing one port of call for
businesses wanting the support services now supplied by a multitude of
organisations.
To speed their development, Michael Heseltine last week increased the budget
for the roll-out of the Business Link brand from Pounds 3m this financial
year to Pounds 17m next year.
The idea of bringing the diverse sources of help for business under one roof
has gained strong national support, particularly from the business community
itself. That said, there are still problems to be overcome before the
network extends across the country.
In theory each Business Link office is meant to be a partnership between the
local Training and Enterprise Council, local authorities, chambers of
commerce, enterprise agencies and the DTI, all of which provide different
forms of support. All will have to subsume their identities beneath the
Business Link flag.
Each Link will structure its services as it sees fit but the range will be
similar. Business Link Birmingham, for example, offers advice, counselling
and support covering eight areas; exporting, sales/marketing, quality, team
development, property, management/finance, technology and legal/regulation.
The problem is that in some areas the chambers, Tecs and local authorities
are finding the idea of forming a partnership easier than actually putting
it into practice.
Some Tecs, for example, are trying to be too dominant within the partnership
and are incurring the DTI's censure; in other areas chambers of commerce
fear they may lose traditional sources of financial support once the
Business Links become self-funding in three years time. The strain has
already proved too much at Business Link Leicester which last month parted
company with its chief executive.
'Everyone is digging their institutional heels in and worrying about their
long-term sources of income,' says Brian Wright, chief executive of the
London Enterprise Agency and a member of the Business Link London steering
board. Partners have to be prepared to lose some power, control and local
identity if the Business Link concept is to have widespread success.
Under the careful watch of Heseltine, a great believer in removing the
disconcerting confusion for businesses seeking support, the DTI is
determined that these turf battles do not dilute the Business Link product
and turn it into just another provider of services.
Bids for Business Link contracts from places like Thames Valley, where there
is a strong chamber of commerce beside a strong Tec, are therefore
progressing well. By contrast, government approval of Business Links appears
to have been withheld in some of the home counties, where, for the moment at
least, there is a lack of strong partners for the local Tecs.
One pressure that might lead to stronger partnerships is local demand from
businesses for what Business Link can offer. Alun Dow, chief executive of
Birmingham Business Link, is in no doubt that this demand exists. 'The
majority of the enquiries have been a general interest in seeing what we can
do,' he says.
In the first nine weeks, his switchboard received 3,800 enquiries. From
these contacts his personal business advisers - in Birmingham's case a
network of 55 independent consultants who behave like general practitioners
 -will be conducting more than 340 diagnostic reviews. They make the first
contact with clients and, if necessary, refer them to specialist
consultants. So far 100 Birmingham companies have been passed on in this
way: they pay a fee subsidised by the Business Link for the service they
subsequently receive.
Business Link support has also shifted perceptably away from an earlier
focus on the smallest companies, many of which had no realistic chance of
growing. Business Link Congleton, for example, is willing to support
sizeable companies like Airbags International, a subsidiary of Electrolux of
Sweden.
Eighteen months ago, the Congleton company which makes safety airbags for
Ford, Saab and BMW, was about to embark on a manufacturing programme that
would increase its workforce from 30 to 200 people. It realised it needed
help handling the growth in its labour force and the transition from what
was effectively a research and development company. It turned to South and
East Cheshire Tec - now a partner in Business Link Congleton - for an
Investors in People programme which helps companies achieve a nationally
agreed standard for training and developing staff.
'Business consultants came in to look at the company to see where we were
hoping to get to and to look at the people we have employed and to match
them with our development goals,' says Ewen Guy, Airbags' personnel manager,
who was also sceptical of consultants who would not help implement their
advice. 'The Tec helps implement the programme; that is one of the main
reasons we took the Tec route.'
One danger of casting their nets this wide is that the quality of diagnosis
and advice may not be maintained. There may simply be a shortage of
adequately qualified consultants trained in Business Link's approach. 'The
personal business advisers will have to be paragons of all the virtues,'
says Wright. 'I wonder about the sheer volume they can get through.'

FT  14 DEC 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Granville teams up with
Postel - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Granville, the private investment banking group, has strengthened its links
with Postel, the UK's largest pension fund, and formed a joint venture to
manage the two groups' private equity portfolios.
The new venture, Granville Private Equity Managers, will manage Postel's
Pounds 195m private equity fund, Granville Development Capital's existing
funds and an additional Pounds 50m which Postel has allocated for new
investment in the next three years.
The deal is an example of the kind of consolidation that venture capital
industry observers expect to see over the next 18 months. A number of
venture capital groups are struggling to raise capital for new funds and
thought to be seeking strategic mergers.
Postel already has a 16 per cent stake in Granville. Two Postel fund
managers, John Brakell and Ray Maxwell, will move across to the new venture.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Marriage bureau for
business angels - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor made the UK far more attractive for business angels by
introducing incentives in last month's budget. But how does the business
seeking finance track down this elusive and largely anonymous breed? And how
does the angel know where to find suitable investments?
The answer is a marriage bureau. Hot on the tail of Kenneth Clarke's budget
the British Venture Capital Association, has produced a guide to these
introduction services.
Compiled by Colin Mason of Southampton University and Prof Richard Harrison
of Ulster Business School, the guide says the business angel can provide the
first rung on the financing ladder.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Management (The Growing Business): How to enjoy a good
grilling - The start of a new business forum in Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The questioning was tough. 'How many deals have you lost because your prices
were too high?' the electronics manufacturer was asked.
'I think about one,' he replied.
'That's not enough,' he was told. 'You're charging too little. If your
prices are too low you make yourself too obvious to your competitors, who
will react to put you out of business.'
This exchange took place recently not in a private meeting between a
managing director and his consultant but in front of about 60 businesspeople
and professional advisers one evening in Glasgow. It was Scotland's first
forum of this kind, aimed at encouraging the creation and growth of new
businesses, and is modelled on the Enterprise Forum pioneered by the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1978.
The bosses of two small electronics companies each gave a 20-minute
presentation, outlining their business, its history, how it worked and its
strategy. Then three senior figures from the Scottish electronics industry
gave a brief assessment of the company and asked hard questions.
Next, the other participants, from high tech companies, banks, accountancy
firms and venture capital companies, made suggestions and asked questions.
The grilling was moderated by an American facilitator.
The forum has been introduced to Scotland by a group of businesspeople and
professionals inspired by an initiative of Scottish Enterprise, the
development body, to improve Scotland's low rate of new company formation.
The business forum differs from other seminars and presentations in allowing
young companies to bare their souls in a non-adversarial atmosphere. The
chairman of the session, Peter Timms, managing director of Flexible
Technology, a PCB assembler, says the aim is 'to allow ambitious
entrepreneurs to test their ideas and overcome the uncertainty and
loneliness of running a young business.'
The companies which make the presentations benefit most: they publicise
their businesses, pick up advice, make contacts and meet potential
investors. But for everyone else it is still a chance to gain business,
either from the presenters or from contacts made during the evening.
The first presentation was by David Milne, managing director of Wolfson
Microelectronics, an Edinburgh semi-conductor company seeking to move from
designing chips to supplying finished products, manufactured under contract.
He had to explain to an assessor (who, unlike the rest of the audience, had
studied the company in advance) what really distinguished his company from
other semi-conductor producers.
The other presenter was Mike Eccles, managing director of Sunnyside Systems,
employing four people in Livingston, West Lothian, which makes electronic
test and measurement equipment for customers such as Rolls-Royce.
One entrepreneur from the floor wondered if Sunnyside Systems was taking
itself seriously enough. 'You seem to have got into this almost by chance -
I'm worried you might drop out of it by chance.'
Assessing the forum later, Eccles said that preparing his presentation
clarified his mind about the company and its strategy, and he found the
comments and suggestions useful. Above all he was subsequently contacted by
several potential investors and partners.
Milne found the technical critique useful but felt that one of the assessors
should have been a financial expert, 'to bridge the gap between financing
and manufacturing.' Although he was already close to securing finance for
the next phase of Wolfson's development, he believes he may have made
contacts at the forum who would help with the subsequent stage.
Both men appreciated meeting so many potentially useful people in a friendly
and supportive atmosphere.
Where the business forum could be even more constructive - or possibly
destructive - would be in assessing the business plan of a company that has
only a business plan, and no track record. The next forum, in February, is
scheduled to do exactly that.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Behaviour blamed on poor teaching
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ofsted, the education watchdog, said yesterday that bad behaviour in schools
was caused by poor teaching.
It said that most classrooms in England and Wales were calm and orderly, but
it noted concern that exclusions of pupils from schools were increasing
sharply, and that there were 'unacceptably wide' variations between schools
in the nature of offences which would lead to exclusion.
Ofsted said: 'For most pupils, good behaviour is associated with a
well-planned and varied curriculum and lively, stimulating teaching.
Expectations of high standards achieved through demanding tasks leave little
time for, or interest in, misbehaviour.'

The public and private sectors will compete to manage a mothballed prison
near Rochdale which is being redeveloped to help cope with growing prisoner
numbers, Alan Pike writes.
Buckley Hall, a former detention centre for 17 to 21-year-olds, closed in
1989 because of structural defects. Most of the existing buildings will be
demolished, and it will be rebuilt to house 300 prisoners by 1995.
The Prison Service intends to market-test the management of Buckley Hall by

FT  14 DEC 93 / Manufacturing upturn begins to falter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Flat manufacturing output since the spring has underlined the weakness of
the UK recovery and depressed state of many overseas markets.
Output by manufacturing industry fell 0.2 per cent in the three months to
October compared with the previous three months, and was at the same level
as in the first quarter.
Factory output between August and October expanded by a weak 1.4 per cent
compared with the corresponding period last year after the vigorous
year-on-year growth of 2.5 per cent recorded in May.
Even so, the subdued nature of the manufacturing recovery has been offset by
strong growth in energy output, which is at its highest level for five years
thanks mainly to increased oil production from the North Sea.
The seasonally adjusted numbers from the Central Statistical Office
illustrate the difficulties faced by much of industry in building up output
after the long recession.
Between September and October, manufacturing increased output by a muted 0.1
per cent compared with City expectations of a 0.3 per cent rise.
Since the second quarter of this year, output from this part of industry has
barely changed after a relatively robust 0.6 per cent rise in production
between the first and second three-monthly periods.
Between August and October, engineering and the sector covering food, drink
and tobacco both saw a drop of 0.4 per cent in output compared with three
months previously. On the same three-monthly basis, output of metals and
metal products fell 1.3 per cent, textiles and clothing was down 0.2 per
cent while chemicals production was unchanged.
A stronger picture of output trends emerges from all production industries -
manufacturing, plus energy and water. In the latest three-month period,
production industries expanded output 0.6 per cent on the May-to-July period
to reach a 2.2 per cent year-on-year increase.
Much of this strong performance was due to a rise in output from the mining
and quarrying sector, which includes oil and gas extraction. In the three
months to October, this sector increased output 2.9 per cent on a
three-monthly basis, or 7.1 per cent year-on-year.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Business schools may lose funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Institute of Economic and Social Research and the London
Business School face withdrawal of government support for their work in
economic modelling under options to be discussed over the next few months,
Peter Marsh writes.
One or both of the groups could find grants for modelling - computer
techniques used in forecasting - cut or even eliminated by a government
funding consortium that includes the Treasury and Bank of England.
At stake could be the survival of top-flight economics research at either
establishment. Between them they receive 70 per cent of the cash from the
consortium under its current phase of research.
The 'big two' supply two of the Treasury's advisory panel of seven 'wise
men' - the institute's Mr Andrew Britton and Professor David Currie, head of
economic forecasting at London Business School.
Two others - Professor Patrick Minford of Liverpool University and Professor
Wynn Godley of Cambridge University - might gain if the consortium reduced
the money going to the big two. Liverpool and Cambridge have both lost their
funding from the consortium over the past decade.
The discussion centres on whether to concentrate money on a few 'centres of
excellence' or to distribute cash more widely to encourage diversity.
The institute and the school are the main beneficiaries of a four-year,
Pounds 2.6m research programme organised by the consortium. The programme
funds only two other establishments - Warwick University, which receives 17
per cent of the cash, and Strathclyde University, which receives 13 per
cent.
The Economic and Social Research Council, a government funding agency, puts
up three-quarters of the cash. The Treasury contributes a fifth and the Bank
a twentieth. Under one option likely to be examined early next year, the
institute or the school might be excluded from a research programme when the
current phase ends in September 1995.
A leading academic economist with strong connections with the council said
there was 'a general sentiment of opposition' to the institute and the
school. 'Unless the consortium comes up with a lot more money they could
find their money chopped so that some of the tiddlers can flourish.'
Next month Professor Gordon Pepper of the City University Business School
will produce a report to the Economic and Social Research Council's Research
Programmes Board setting out priorities in modelling. The report will also
be circulated to the Bank and the Treasury.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Output prices held steady
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manufacturers have barely increased their prices since the summer according
to government figures released yesterday that illustrate the weakness of
inflationary pressures.
Prices of materials and energy bought by manufacturers were 1.8 per cent
lower in November than 12 months earlier, the biggest yearly drop since July
last year.
The figures from the Central Statistical Office underline how inflation has
been falling under the influence of low demand, small increases in wage
costs and a fall in the prices of many commodities such as oil.
Sterling's 10.4 per cent depreciation since Britain's exit from the exchange
rate mechanism in September last year has failed to spur inflation in spite
of higher import costs.
Between July and last month prices of manufactured goods for domestic sale
at the wholesale level have risen by just 0.2 per cent on a basis that does
not include adjustments for seasonal factors.
Prices were unchanged last month from October. In the year to November,
prices rose by 3.6 per cent - the smallest yearly increase since February
and a figure slightly lower than City expectations. In the year to October
output prices rose 4 per cent.
Excluding food, drink, tobacco and petrol - whose prices are affected by tax
changes - wholesale prices of factory goods rose 3.2 per cent in the year to
November, the same as in the year to October.
Adjusted for seasonal changes, prices of these classes of products rose 0.2
per cent in November compared with October while they increased 1.1 per cent
between July and last month on the same basis.
The fall in the year to November of prices of materials and fuel bought by
manufacturers came in spite of a rise last month in the costs of electricity
to large industrial groups. In the year to October, overall prices of
materials and fuel rose 0.5 per cent.
Prices of crude oil bought by manufacturers fell by 16.2 per cent in the
year to last month. Over the same period prices of UK-produced foodstuffs
fell 3.3 per cent, while prices of general fuels, chemicals, metals and
imported foods increased by 0.6 per cent, 0.9 per cent, 0.2 per cent and 4.9
per cent respectively.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Reassurance on video games
</HEADLINE>

Video games carry only a small chance of triggering epileptic fits, a study
ordered by the Department of Trade and Industry's Consumer Safety Unit said
yesterday.
People who suffer a first fit while playing games usually have an
unrecognised sensitivity to flashing light, said the report. Watching games
would 'very rarely' spark an epileptic seizure in people without a history
of the condition.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Budget 'likely to halve growth in construction'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the construction industry's foremost leading forecasting bodies has
halved its projections for growth next year, blaming measures announced in
the Budget last month.
The National Council of Building Material Producers, which represents more
than 2,000 companies, yesterday forecast that construction output would rise
by only 0.5 per cent next year after falling this year. Before the Budget
the council had been forecasting a 1 per cent rise.
Mr Peter Roberts, chairman of the forecasting panel, said growth would slow
as a result of reductions in government spending on housing associations and
roads. He said: 'The chancellor's Budget was not one for the construction
industry in the short term.'
He was also concerned that government attempts to encourage greater
private-sector investment in toll roads, railways and other infrastruc-ture
would not come through quickly enough to offset public spending cuts
elsewhere.
He said: 'It is essential the private finance initiative is kept at the top
of the political agenda and more projects are seen to come to fruition.'
The council has not altered its forecast that output will fall by 2 per cent
this year. This would mean that the value of output in constant 1985 prices
has fallen by almost 17 per cent since 1990. The council expects the pace of
recovery will accelerate in 1995 when it expects output to rise by 2 per
cent.
It says that the slower rate of growth forecast for next year was because of
a Pounds 900m cut in the Housing Corporation development programme. It
expects this will reduce the number of homes started by the public sector
next year from 42,000 to 36,000, falling to 33,000 in 1995.
Central government spending on roads was expected to fall by 7 per cent
while tough spending constraints on councils would affect investment in
local roads and council house repair and maintenance, the council said.
But it did not expect phased reductions in mortgage tax relief, also
announced in the Budget, to inhibit the recovery in the housing market. It
expects the number of private-sector starts to rise from 140,000 to 150,000
next year, increasing to 160,000 in 1995.
Factory and warehouse building was forecast to rise by 5 per cent next year.
The rate of decline in commercial construction, mainly offices and shops,
was expected to fall from 20 per cent to 5 per cent next year. Commercial
output, however, was forecast to rise by 5 per cent in 1995.

FT  14 DEC 93 / New town body to offer land as prize
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Commission for the New Towns, responsible for development and sales of
publicly owned assets in 21 English towns, is offering prizes of land at a
discount, or even free, to winners of a competition between councils and
private-sector partners, Paul Cheeseright, Midlands Correspondent, writes.
It is asking councils which have new towns in their areas to combine with
companies to submit plans by March for housing, commercial or leisure
developments on or near commission land. Winning plans would receive land at
less than its commercial value. The competition, announced yesterday in
Telford to coincide with the new town's 25th anniversary, is designed not
only to hasten development in the new towns but also to accelerate
commission land sales.
The commission is being wound up by the government in 1998, by which time it
hopes to have sold the assets in the new towns.
Since 1979 it has raised Pounds 2bn for the Treasury. Its contribution in
1992-93 was Pounds 165m and, with property markets still uncertain, is
expected to be about the same this year.
Assets for disposal include 9.6m sq ft of commercial premises and 18,000
acres of land. The largest concentrations of land are in Milton Keynes and
Telford, each of which has about 4,000 acres controlled by the commission.
No estimates have been drawn up of the effect of cheap land disposals on the
commission's annual contribution to the Treasury. This contribution is used
to offset part of the Department of Environment's urban and regional
spending. But the commission noted that the use of land which it could not
immediately expect to sell would enhance property values in the town where
the development took place.
The competition is being run jointly by the commission and the Association
of District Councils. It follows the established government policy of using
a contest to encourage the formation of partnerships between the public and
private sectors for a specific purpose or development.
The commission was anxious that its competition should not be seen as a
device for selling off land at distress rates. Rather, it said, the
reduction in the price of any land would be related to the quality of the
scheme being advanced by a council and its partners.
The English new towns, in addition to Milton Keynes and Telford, are
Aycliffe, Basildon, Bracknell, Central Lancashire, Corby, Crawley, Harlow,
Hatfield, Hemel Hempstead, Northampton, Peterborough, Peterlee, Redditch,
Runcorn, Skelmersdale, Stevenage, Warrington, Washington and Welwyn Garden
City.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Rover to raise car prices by 2.9%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The price of Rover cars is to rise by an average of 2.9 per cent from
Monday.
The increase, Rover's first for a year, is expected to be followed by other
manufacturers next month.
However, some of Rover's rivals indicated last night that the traditional
new year round of price increases - which has usually been triggered by
market leader Ford - may not materialise because of exceptionally
competitive conditions in the new car market.
Rover last increased its prices - also by an average of 2.9 per cent - last
December.
Ford prices have had a complex year. In January there were substantial
increases, mostly between 4.5 and 7.5 per cent. They were then cut by an
average of 5.2 per cent in April, though Ford increased them by an average
of 2.55 per cent in August.
Vauxhall imposed average increases of 2 per cent and 2.45 per cent in March
and August respectively. Peugeot has also put its prices up by a total of 3
per cent.

FT  14 DEC 93 / George plans shake-up as role changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England is planning an internal restructuring that could result
in its operations being grouped in two broad 'wings'. One wing would focus
on achieving monetary stability and the other on ensuring the stability of
the financial system.
Mr Eddie George, the Bank's governor, and its senior directors worked out
the plan to replace the Bank's present tangled allocation of
responsibilities in more than a dozen divisions and three departments at a
special weekend meeting earlier this month.
The plan, which is viewed in Threadneedle Street as a separate issue from
the debate over whether to give the Bank greater independence from the
Treasury in its conduct of monetary policy, is still being thrashed out.
If carried through, it will be the Bank's first significant internal
restructuring since 1980. The plan follows last July's change of top
management when Mr George moved from being deputy governor to governor and
Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea, former editor of the Economist, was appointed deputy.
Mr Pennant-Rea has formed a working party to handle the restructuring.
The plan to create a monetary wing responsible for price stability
recognises the more explicit counter-inflationary role that has been given
to the Bank since Britain left the exchange rate mechanism of the European
Monetary System in September last year.
The wing would include the parts of the Bank responsible for monetary
operations, including the markets section, as well as some banking
activities and the economic analysis division.
Banking supervision would be the main responsibility of the financial
stability wing, which would also take over the Bank's duties for making the
City function well.
These include the non-statutory supervision of bullion and foreign exchange
markets and gilt-edged marketmakers (Gemms) as well as its work on
payments-and-settlements systems, stock exchange dealings systems and
Lloyd's, the insurance market.
Officials stressed yesterday that the plans were still a 'strategic vision'
that would be refined over the next six months. There is no intention to
reorganise the Bank in one 'big bang' and no timetable for the full
implementation of the ideas.
The personnel consequences have still to be worked out. It is unclear how
the Bank's executive directors fit in the new structure, although the
imminent departure of Mr Andrew Crockett, the international director, to
head the Bank for International Settlements in Basle and the approaching
retirement of Mr Tony Coleby, the director handling monetary issues, should
create some flexibility.
The proposed restructuring would not affect the Bank's 'court', which
advises the management on policy. Any big change in the court's structure
would require an act of parliament, which is unlikely unless the Bank is
given independence.
The planned management changes would be compatible with a more independent
Bank, however. The movement to give the Bank greater freedom is expected to
be boosted on Thursday when the Commons Treasury and civil service committee
publishes a report that is widely expected to support more autonomy for the
Bank.
New capital issues by UK borrowers last month totalled Pounds 4.635bn of
which Pounds 3.592bn was denominated in sterling, the Bank said yesterday.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Deputy Bank chief warns of rate rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England yesterday gave its clearest warning yet that Britain
would raise interest rates if sharp price increases by companies threatened
to push inflation through the top of its target range.
Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea, the Bank's deputy governor, entered the debate about
whether companies have raised margins excessively.
He stressed that conditions of low inflation required different corporate
policies, with companies aiming for higher sales rather than higher prices.
A month ago, Mr Eddie George, the Bank's governor, sparked controversy when
he said more than half of recent increases in manufacturers' output prices
came from higher margins.
The row was fuelled by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, who said a sharp
10 per cent increase in export prices in the past year was a 'vivid
reminder' that UK management prefers higher returns rather than higher
volumes when competing overseas.
Yesterday, Mr Pennant-Rea denied that the Bank was telling managers how to
run their businesses.
However, he stressed that the government's aim of keeping the 12-month
change in the retail prices index, excluding mortgage interest payments,
within a range of 1 per cent to 4 per cent - and holding it in the lower
half of that range by the end of this parliament - would have a powerful
effect on companies' pricing policies.
'We plan to take inflation off the menu,' Mr Pennant-Rea told the City
branch of the Institute of Directors. That meant no big monetary boost to
pull the economy out of recession, no boom-bust cycle, and avoidance of
conditions that produced a big surge in wages.
Companies would not be able to raise prices on the assumption that
competitors were doing the same, he added.
Mr Pennant-Rea said that if companies raised prices beyond the target range,
'we, the policymakers, will raise interest rates. If firms show restraint,
aiming for bigger volumes rather than wider margins, then interest rates can
be restrained too.'
The deputy governor's warnings came against a background of disappointing
industrial production figures and official statistics showing only modest
inflationary pressures from producer prices.
Mr Pennant-Rea said the present low inflation climate opened the way for
companies to boost profits through higher volumes rather than prices. The
profitability of UK companies was 'pretty robust' and close to that in many
other countries. It meant companies would be pricing themselves out of the
market if they tried to boost their margins by raising prices.
With an inflation target, corporate price decisions had 'huge implications'
for the macroeconomic conditions that companies faced, he said.
'We are resolved to achieve overall price stability. Business will benefit
hugely from that,' he said.
But it would benefit even more if, in advance of that stability 'it begins
to think of the long term: of extra volumes and more market share as the
road to enduring profitability'.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Business failures decline sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of business failures and bad debts dropped by a third in the
third quarter compared with the same period in 1992, figures from Trade
Indemnity, the trade credit insurer, showed yesterday.
In further indications of the recovery, all regions and all industry sectors
reported declines in the number of failures in the period from July to
September.
The total of failures and bad debts, based on reports from Trade Indemnity
clients, was 1,171 against 1,780 in the third quarter last year. The latest
figures showed an 18 per cent decline on the second quarter of this year.
Mr William Simpson, chief economist, said the trend 'provides conclusive
proof that recovery in the UK is now established'. But he stressed that many
businesses reliant on summer business slow down in the fourth quarter while
those dependent on Christmas sales may also yet suffer difficulties.
The largest falls between the third quarters of 1992 and 1993 were 51 per
cent in Wales, 49 per cent in East Anglia and 45 per cent in Scotland.
The sharpest sectoral declines between the same periods were 40 per cent for
building and construction, 39 per cent for furniture and upholstery and 37
per cent for textiles and clothing. The smallest decrease in failures was of
just 2 per cent in northern England. There was a 15 per cent decline in the
north-west.
Trade Indemnity warned that the risk of smaller companies failing would
remain high because of their more limited access to funding.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Young joins Branson in lottery bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Young, chairman of Cable and Wireless, and Mr Richard Branson, chairman
of Virgin Atlantic Airways, yesterday announced they were joining forces to
launch a National Lottery bid which will covenant all its profits to a
charitable foundation.
Mr Branson said: 'If we can pull this off I think it will be the most
important thing we will achieve in our lifetimes.' Neither he nor Lord
Young, a former Tory cabinet minister, will take a fee. Lord Young, who will
chair the operating company, said yesterday: 'This is a very, very serious
bid which is properly worked out. Because of our structure we believe we are
going to have the most competitive bid.'
Mr Branson will be managing director of the operating company working
alongside a chief executive whom he refused to name. The leading technical
partner in the bid for the licence by the UK Lottery Foundation will be IBM,
the computer company.
The bid is likely to be one of at least eight contenders expected to submit
their bids in February.
If the Lottery Foundation wins the licence, Lord Callaghan, Sir Angus
Ogilvy, Viscount Tonypandy and Viscount Whitelaw will all become trustees in
addition to Lord Young and Mr Branson.
Mr Branson predicted yesterday that the public would spend Pounds 1 or
Pounds 2 a week more on the lottery each week if they knew that all the
profits were going to good causes.
Mr Anthony Fry, who is putting together a bid backed by NM Rothschild and
Tattersalls, the Australian lottery operator, said yesterday the Branson bid
would be no different from any other. 'Providers of capital and services
suppliers will want a proper return on their investment,' Mr Fry said.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Two economics schools face loss of state funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Institute of Economic and Social Research and the London
Business School face withdrawal of government support for their work in
economic modelling under options to be discussed over the next few months.
One or both of the groups could find grants for modelling - computer
techniques used in forecasting - cut or even eliminated by a government
funding consortium that includes the Treasury and Bank of England.
At stake could be the survival of top-flight economics research at either
establishment. Between them they receive 70 per cent of the cash from the
consortium under its current phase of research.
The 'big two' supply two of the Treasury's advisory panel of seven 'wise
men' - the institute's Mr Andrew Britton and Professor David Currie, head of
economic forecasting at London Business School.
Two others - Professor Patrick Minford of Liverpool University and Professor
Wynn Godley of Cambridge University - might gain if the consortium reduced
the money going to the big two. Liverpool and Cambridge have both lost their
funding from the consortium over the past decade.
The discussion centres on whether to concentrate money on a few 'centres of
excellence' or to distribute cash more widely to encourage diversity.
The institute and the school are the main beneficiaries of a four-year,
Pounds 2.6m research programme organised by the consortium. The programme
funds only two other establishments - Warwick University, which receives 17
per cent of the cash, and Strathclyde University, which receives 13 per
cent.
The Economic and Social Research Council, a government funding agency, puts
up three-quarters of the cash. The Treasury contributes a fifth and the Bank
a twentieth. Under one option likely to be examined early next year, the
institute or the school might be excluded from a research programme due to
start when the current phase ends in September 1995.
A leading academic economist with strong connections with the council said
there was 'a general sentiment of opposition' to the institute and the
school. 'Unless the consortium comes up with a lot more money they could
find their money chopped so that some of the tiddlers can flourish.'
Over the next few months officials from the council, Treasury and Bank will
discuss the next phase of the programme with academic economists.
Next month Professor Gordon Pepper of the City University Business School
will produce a report to the Economic and Social Research Council's Research
Programmes Board setting out priorities in modelling. The report will also
be circulated to the Bank and the Treasury.
Prof Pepper said his report would set out a 'powerful case' for expanding
economic modelling research. He did not want to spell out out how much extra
money he would seek from consortium members.
Prof Pepper's view will have to be assessed later in the year by the council
and the other consortium members, to see how much money is available in the
light of tight public spending constraints. After this will come the job of
directing cash to specific research groups.
Professor Charlie Bean of the London School of Economics, who is helping
Prof Pepper draw up his report, said the discussion about the new phase of
modelling posed general questions about funding research with limited money.
It was 'conceivable' that either the school or the institute could find its
funding cut 'in the cause of promoting diversity'.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Marketing departments 'fail to sell themselves in-house'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Marketing departments often lack accountability and are not involved in
activities central to companies' success, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountants
and consultants, said yesterday.
Managing directors 'are beginning to have reservations' about the marketing
function, with a fifth of directors forecasting that it will have a
declining influence on company success over the next five years, Coopers
says. Marketing and managing directors in 100 of the largest companies in
retailing, financial services, and consumer goods were questioned.
The report finds fewer than half of all marketing departments responsible
for the development of pricing strategies while only a quarter have
responsibility for customer service. Only 42 per cent are involved in
just-in-time programmes and 31 per cent are involved in total quality
initiatives - activities identified by Coopers as important to companies'
success. The study sees a gap between the perceptions of marketing directors
and their bosses.
In the area of strategic planning, 61 per cent of marketing directors said
they made an important contribution. Only 44 per cent of managing directors
agreed. Most procedures for measuring the effectiveness of marketing
activity are irrelevant and result in a lack of accountability, says the
report: 57 per cent of the companies surveyed use sales revenue, 53 per cent
use market share and 39 per cent use net profit to measure marketing
effectiveness.
'Since marketing has responsibility for few measurable outputs, it is
difficult to justify using criteria over which it has only a potential or
hypothetical impact,' the report says.
The report concludes that the most effective marketing departments of the
future will take on responsibility for all 'processes that contribute to
managing the customer and consumer interface'. These could include handling
customer complaints or devising payment procedures.
Mr Rod Wilkes, chairman of The Chartered Institute of Marketing, said he was
'totally at odds' with the report. Most fast-moving consumer goods companies
were marketing-led, and in any company 'it should be the marketing director
who co-ordinates the business plan,' he said.
Footballers who find themselves out of a job in their mid 30s are to get the
chance of a second career in marketing.
The Professional Footballers' Association is piloting a two-year part-time
course in Warrington which will lead to a certificate from the Chartered
Institute of Marketing.
Seven footballers, including Everton's Matthew Jackson and PFA executive
committee member George Berry, are taking part in the pilot. The aim is to
help footballers who want to get a marketing job in sport or industry after
they have given up playing.

FT  14 DEC 93 / PM says any accord must be 'balanced'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major acknowledged yesterday that a Anglo-Irish declaration designed
to restore peace to Northern Ireland would have to balance guarantees to
unionists with recognition of the aspirations of the province's
nationalists.
As British officials suggested that he might yet hold a third meeting with
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, as early as tomorrow, Mr Major
told MPs they were seeking a declaration that would end IRA terrorism.
Despite a fierce warning from the Rev Ian Paisley, Democratic Unionist
leader, of a Protestant backlash, Mr Major said both premiers wanted a
'balanced' declaration.
His comments appeared to signal that the government is ready to give some
ground to demands from Mr Reynolds that Dublin's acceptance of a unionist
veto must be accompanied by language in the statement which would have a
reasonable chance of securing a cessation of IRA violence.
Mr Major appeared to shift further in that direction with his explicit
acknowledgement during comments on the weekend IRA murder of two policemen
that he was looking for 'a circumstance that will end such murders in
future'.
It is thought that the talks inched forward during the course of the day. An
Irish government spokesman said last night that the two prime ministers
would be in touch by phone this morning to review progress and to try to
agree the date for their third meeting in as many weeks.
Mr Major said he could offer no guarantee that a declaration would be agreed
before parliament breaks for the Christmas recess on Friday, and it was
still possible that the talks would break down.
But Downing Street aides said a further meeting would take place before
Christmas.
Mr Paisley warned that the price demanded by the IRA was 'too high'.
Another warning was delivered by a leading member of Sinn Fein, the
political wing of the IRA. Mr Mitchel McLaughlin, chairman of Sinn Fein's
Ulster executive, said that if the opportunity of peace was 'squandered',
Northern Ireland could face civil war.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Major claims EU follows his lead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major claimed yesterday that other European Union governments had
adopted Britain's agenda for economic recovery and were endorsing policies
which many had regarded as 'unthinkable' a few years ago.
In an uncompromising statement in the Commons, the prime minister told MPs
that the government had endorsed Mr Jacques Delors' plans for higher growth
and employment only because 'we took out the bits we rubbished.'
What remained, he added, was the British prescription of firm control of
public spending and inflation, open markets, decentralisation and de -
regulation and flexibility in Labour markets.
But Mr Major's account of the weekend summit of EU leaders drew scorn from
opposition leaders. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, accused Mr Major of
backing in Brussels policies to boost employment but of failing to deliver
high-quality training and education in Britain.
The Labour leader also attacked Mr Major's refusal - underlined again in the
Commons exchanges - to agree to higher Community borrowing to finance major
European transport projects.
Mr Smith asked MPs: 'If projects make sense, what is so wrong about
borrowing for genuine investment in vital infrastructure projects that will
improve our economy, create jobs, stimulate growth and competitiveness and,
in the medium term, put our public finances in proper order?'
Mr Major said the EU had at last rejected 'outdated policies' involving
extra burdens on business and borrowing.
Stressing repeatedly the importance of a successful conclusion of the
present GATT round of world trade negotiations, Mr Major said that Europe
now agreed 'the only road to economic recovery is the one on which this
government is already embarked'.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Mayhew offered to go in leak row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Patrick Mayhew was ready to resign over the mistakes in government
papers giving details of secret exchanges with Sinn Fein leaders, it emerged
yesterday.
Friends of the Northern Ireland secretary say his 'sense of honour' led him
to offer his resignation after the mistakes which gave the republicans a
propaganda victory.
They said the mistakes were not his fault and that the papers - published
last month after the government admitted it had been in contact with
Provisional leaders over an extended period - were not kept at the Northern
Ireland Office.
The government admitted to the errors in the papers, with Sir Patrick
accepting 'full ministerial responsibility', late on the night of December 1
 -two days after it published its version of the exchanges.
It said the mistakes were made in transcription and typing and did not alter
the sense.
But the admission embarrassed the government because it confirmed that Sinn
Fein's version of one key document was accurate.
The mistakes in the government's version of this document were particularly
unfortunate in the light of repeated denials by Sinn Fein that it initiated
the messages - as claimed by the government.
Neither Downing Street nor the Northern Ireland Office would comment last
night.
There were suggestions that the government's originally released version of
the wording - now accepted as wrong - appeared to confirm Sinn Fein as the
initiator of the exchanges, while the Sinn Fein version implied otherwise.
Sir Patrick said the corrections cast 'no doubt whatsoever' upon the
authenticity of the first message in the exchanges, said to have come from
Mr Martin McGuinness in February, which said the conflict was over.
Downing Street said after Sir Patrick's original admission of government
contacts with the IRA leadership that there was no question of the Northern
Ireland secretary being forced to resign. The government's acknowledgement
of the contacts clouded the Dublin summit between Mr John Major and Mr
Albert Reynolds on December 3.
Nearly two years ago, Mr Major rejected an offer to resign from Mr Peter
Brooke, Sir Patrick's predecessor, after he had been criticised for singing
on a TV chat show within hours of an IRA bomb.

FT  14 DEC 93 / MPs' aerospace appeal rebuffed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday rejected calls from the all-party Commons trade and
industry committee for a detailed policy framework on the UK aerospace
industry.
Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, said: 'We do not believe that any
reliable or precise estimates can be made about the levels of research and
technology (in the British aerospace industry).'
Government officials likened the committee's recommendation for a detailed
framework governing decisions on aerospace as akin to a five-year plan which
would be unworkable and unpractical.
But Mr Derek Flatchett, Labour's industry spokesman, said the committee had
rightly identified a role for government.
'We need a new strategic view and vision of the partnership between industry
and government,' he said.
The committee warned that the industry could suffer 'irreversible damage'
without more government support and was falling victim to heavily subsidised
competitors from other countries.
Mr Sainsbury said the government would act 'within international rules' to
challenge the subsidies offered to Britain's competitors. He added, however,
that the current support was the envy of many other industries.
Mr Richard Caborn, the committee's Labour chairman, called on the government
to multiply aid five-fold to Pounds 100m.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Contracting-out may be clarified
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Officials at the Department of Employment said some of the legal uncertainty
surrounding contracting-out of public services could be removed early next
year when the European Commission reviews its Acquired Rights Directive.
The directive, which aims to protect the conditions of employment of
employees when their jobs are transferred from one employer to another, has
served as a deterrent to potential bidders for services being put out to
tender in local and central government.
Many private contractors say that Whitehall policies on how to implement
this directive, known as Tupe in its British form, are making sustainable
bids impossible.
The European Union's weekend summit agreed to include Tupe in the list of
policy areas that would be subject to a subsidiarity test, with a view to
simplifying the complicated regulations. However the government is unlikely
to succeed in excluding contracting-out from the regulations.
A new draft of the regulations will be presented early next year and will go
before ministers in June.
Mr John Hall, director-general of the Business Services Association, which
lobbies on behalf of contractors, has written to Mr Jonathan Aitken,
minister of state for defence procurement, complaining that the MoD
procurement executive requires contractors to guarantee not to sack
employees or change their conditions of employment for 15 months.
He said recent industrial tribunal cases to decide whether Tupe applies
usually concluded that the regulations do not apply.
Mr Hall is optimistic that the Commission review will redefine the concept
of 'undertaking' to ensure that Tupe only applies when whole organisations,
rather than functions, are transferred.
Other lobbyists pressing for reform of Tupe are more circumspect about
reform. Opponents of reform such as Mr Stephen Bubb of the Association of
Metropolitan Authorities say the Commission is more likely to tighten the
regulations than relax them.
Contractors have suffered a blow from the government actuary's department,
which has confirmed that bids for National Health Service work will have to
provide a pension package 'broadly equivalent' to the one currently enjoyed
by employees.
While the government had already indicated that pensions are covered by the
Tupe regulations, a recent industrial tribunal case cast doubt on this.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Allied Dunbar will resist Revenue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Allied Dunbar, the financial services subsidiary of BAT, is expected to
resist attempts by the Inland Revenue to clamp down on the self-employed
basis used by its managers on commission payments.
The company's advisers will soon enter detailed discussions with inspectors
from the Revenue's inquiry branch, which began to examine its affairs more
than a year ago.
One big insurer said yesterday that tax officials were 'picking off' new
sales consultants over the tax treatment of loans received from the company
in advance of commission payments. It said the Revenue was pressing for the
loans to be treated as income from the date of the loan, rather than from
the dates of the commission payments.
The Revenue last night denied that it was conducting any 'campaign' against
the life industry, or against the self-employed.
Allied Dunbar said it had already concluded separate discussions with the
Revenue on the subject. The company is preparing a series of reports to be
submitted early next year focusing on two significant areas which are dealt
with in varying ways across the divisions of the company.
The first is the treatment of 'soft commissions' or payments in kind through
the donation or use of equipment by brokers and marketmakers in exchange for
business.
Advisers to Allied Dunbar may request capital allowances if the Revenue
clamps down on the way these commissions are treated as income.
The second issue deals with bonuses awarded to managers in recognition of
commissions earned by their sales staff, which are currently treated as
self-employed income. A move to the pay-as-you earn system would provide
quicker and simpler tax collection.
Prudential and Legal &amp; General, two of the largest life houses, said their
sales managers received no payments on which they were taxed as
self-employed.
Advisers to Allied Dunbar said the sums under dispute were not very large.
It is believed that it has so far received no assessments for the past tax
year on the topics under investigation.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Last of Britain's pit ponies to be put out to pasture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's last deep-mine pit ponies are to be put out to pasture by the end
of March when the final eight are to be made redundant at Ellington colliery
in Northumberland, Chris Tighe writes.
Ponies have been working in British mines for two centuries, and their use
grew rapidly from 1860 when women and children were forbidden from working
underground. In 1913, there were 68,000 ponies in mines from Kent to
Scotland. In spite of the increasing mechanisation of coal mining, ponies
have continued to play an important role at many collieries. At Sacriston
pit in County Durham they were used until eight years ago, being led out for
the last time (above) in 1985.
At Ellington the pit ponies work up to seven miles out under the North Sea
pulling tubs of salvaged steel girders. At present they live about 300 feet
underground in their stables, with a round-the-clock team of horsekeepers
and a number of fat, mouse-eating cats for company. Each pony is assigned to
a three-man team of miners and works the 8.30am to 3.15pm shift. They have
one week's holiday a year above ground. Contrary to mythology, they are not
blind.
By spring, British Coal hopes to have found all eight, mares and geldings
aged from nine to 20, suitable homes. However, the ponies cannot be ridden
because they have never been broken in.
'There's a great feeling of comradeship between man and pony,' said Mr Ian
Lavery, NUM miners' union lodge secretary at Ellington, where 650 men, more
than half the human workforce, are to lose their jobs by 1996.
There would be mixed feelings and sadness at the ponies going, he said, but
they had been well cared for. He added: 'British Coal probably look after
the ponies better than their own men.'

FT  14 DEC 93 / Tories threaten to rebel over guillotine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government could face a rebellion by Tory backbenchers in the Commons
today when it takes its first steps to rush through two key pieces of
revenue-raising legislation.
Three backbench Tory MPs said last night that they were deeply unhappy about
today's 'guillotine' motion, which aims to get bills reducing the statutory
sick pay subsidy to employers and raising National Insurance contributions
from employees' through all their Commons stages by Thursday night. Mr
Richard Shepherd, MP for Arlidge-Brownhills, said that he would abstain from
voting on today's guillotine motion and on both bills later in the week. He
believes the decision to push the legislation through quickly is an
'infringement of free speech'.
The other two backbenchers, Mr Nicholas Winterton, MP for Macclesfield, and
Mr Patrick Cormack, MP for Staffordshire South, said that they were
considering abstaining, also in the belief that the guillotine will give MPs
too little time to consider the issues.
The government's majority of 17 means that ministers remain confident that
the legislation will pass on time and without hitches. But the rebellion
will put additional pressure on Tory whips after Labour's decision to
protest against the guillotine and abandon its arrangement to 'pair off' MPs
with opponents so that both can be absent during divisions.
Mr Derek Foster, Labour's chief whip, believes this move may make life
difficult for government whips, who will have to ensure that sufficient MPs
are in the Commons to vote the measures through.
Mr David Winnick, Labour MP for Walsall North, said there would be no
consensus over proposed reforms to the hours of Commons sittings 'as long as
the government treats the House with the contempt it is showing this week'.
If today's guillotine is passed, the Statutory Sick Pay Bill will be debated
for no more than six hours tomorrow, with MPs voting at 10pm. The debate
raising the National Insurance contribution will go through the same
curtailed procedures on Thursday. After consideration by the Lords, both
bills should be on the statute book in the new year.
It is not unusual for legislation to pass through the Commons at such speed,
but Labour says it is almost unprecedented so early in a parliamentary
session.
Ministers say the sick pay and National Insurance legislation have to be on
the statute book quickly so that employers can make provision for the
changes. The measures will raise about Pounds 2.5bn for the Exchequer next
year.

FT  14 DEC 93 / MPs told details of fraud at British Council
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two frauds and a theft in the past financial year have cost the British
Council more than Pounds 500,000, the Commons public accounts committee was
told yesterday.
Mr John Hanson, director-general of the council, a quango which operates
educational services outside the UK, told the committee he 'bitterly
regretted' the losses, which had led the council to abandon planned projects
in several eastern European countries as well as South Africa and Malaysia.
Sir John Bourn, the comptroller and auditor-general, told the committee the
biggest fraud took place last September, when Pounds 520,072 was paid in
foreign currency through the electronic transfer system into overseas bank
accounts of bogus suppliers following the receipt of seven fraudulent
payment vouchers by the council's banking section.
Mr Hanson told the committee the vouchers had been put into the council's
computer system by an 'external criminal gang'. The council's banking system
had not been 'protected with the same barrier of controls which had been
erected around the main payment system'.
Mr Robert Sheldon, chairman of the committee, suggested that the vouchers
'could only have been obtained from within the system', and said 'there
appears to be some criminal element within the body itself'.
Mr Hanson admitted that the criminal gang had access to 'insider
information', but denied that this necessarily came from a past or present
British Council employee. He said the gang could have been helped by a
temporary employee or contractor.
The police had arrested and charged three people in connection with the
fraud, and arrested a fourth, he said. None had ever been employed by the
council. To date, only Pounds 19,751 had been recovered.
Separately, Sir John told the committee that in February the council had
discovered that a finance officer in an overseas division had defrauded the
council of funds and travel tickets worth Pounds 51,861.
The fraud had been difficult to discover because 'the key control checks had
been delegated to the perpetrator,' Sir John said. Mr Hanson said the
employee had been dismissed, tried, found guilty and was awaiting sentence.
Sir John added that a member of staff had been dismissed following a
burglary of Pounds 8,145 from the council's office at Victoria station in
London, while transactions of about Pounds 9,000 in one of the London
departments 'appeared to have been fraudulent'.
Mr Hanson told the committee that the payments had involved overstated
claims for overseas travel and subsistence. The employee had retired in
February and could not be traced, so the money was to be retrieved by
deducting from payments made to him to cover his early retirement.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Portillo indicates tough spending stance will stay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's public expenditure control totals for 1995-96 and 1996-97
will almost certainly be adopted as the ceilings for next year's round of
public spending negotiations between the Treasury and other government
departments, Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, said
yesterday.
Signalling a continuation of the government's rigorous approach to public
spending, Mr Portillo told the Commons Treasury and civil service committee
that he expected the cabinet next summer would confirm the figures as the
remit for next autumn's spending round.
His reply indicated that non-cyclical expenditure, which has been set at
Pounds 251.3bn in 1994-95, will not be allowed to exceed Pounds 263bn in
1995-96 and Pounds 272.3bn in the following financial year. That would hold
the control totals to real increases of 0.9 per cent in 1995-96 and 1 per
cent in 1996-97.
Mr Portillo agreed with the committee that the tax increases planned in this
year's two Budgets would play an ever greater role in reducing the public
sector borrowing requirement over the coming three financial years. But he
said that some of the spending curbs announced in Mr Kenneth Clarke's Budget
last month would produce savings beyond the April 1997 limit to the
government's present spending plans.
Proposals to restructure invalidity and unemployment benefit would produce
savings after 1997, while more savings could emerge from the fundamental
reviews of spending priorities in large departments such as social security,
he said.
He disclosed that during the first half of next year the Treasury would be
investigating issues that transcend the boundaries between government
departments.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Hanson to sell Bristol site
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, has agreed to sell part of a
56-acre site in south Bristol as a campus for a further-education college.
This follows the failure to find a single purchaser for the site, which
incorporates one of Europe's largest air-conditioned factories.
The company plans to develop the site, once the headquarters of Imperial
Tobacco, which Hanson acquired in 1986, as a campus for South Bristol
College.
The factory will be demolished and replaced by an enterprise centre and a
non-food retail and leisure complex. Hanson estimates that the scheme will
cost up to Pounds 35m and that 1,200 jobs will be created.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Names' right to sue agents upheld
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Court of Appeal yesterday upheld the right of loss-making Names on the
Lloyd's insurance market to sue members' agents in a move that paves the way
for a series of legal actions next year.
The decision removes one of the final barriers to litigation by Names - the
individuals whose assets traditionally supported the insurance market - on
the Gooda Walker and Feltrim syndicates.
Sir Thomas Bingham, the Master of the Rolls, Lord Justice Hoffmann and Lord
Justice Henry ruled in the Court of Appeal that members' agents were
contractually responsible for any negligence by the management and
underwriters of syndicates they selected for Names. They did not grant leave
to appeal.
The ruling comes as the Names are deciding whether to accept a Pounds 900m
out-of-court settlement offered by Lloyd's.
The Gooda Walker Action Group is expected to write to its members at the end
of this week recommending that they reject Lloyd's settlement offer and
continue to pursue legal action.

FT  14 DEC 93 / New town body to offer land as prize
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Commission for the New Towns, responsible for development and sales of
publicly owned assets in 21 English towns, is offering prizes of land at a
discount, or even free, to winners of a competition between councils and
private-sector partners, Paul Cheeseright writes.
It is asking councils which have new towns in their areas to combine with
companies to submit plans by March for housing, commercial or leisure
developments on or near commission land. Winning plans would receive land at
less than its commercial value. The competition, announced yesterday in
Telford to coincide with the new town's 25th anniversary, is designed not
only to hasten development in the new towns but also to accelerate
commission land sales.
The commission is being wound up by the government in 1998, by which time it
hopes to have sold the assets in the new towns.
Since 1979 it has raised Pounds 2bn for the Treasury. Its contribution in
1992-93 was Pounds 165m and, with property markets still uncertain, is
expected to be about the same this year.
Assets for disposal include 9.6m sq ft of commercial premises and 18,000
acres of land. The largest concentrations of land are in Milton Keynes and
Telford, each of which has about 4,000 acres controlled by the commission.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Ministers confident bills will pass
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ministers are confident that they will get two important pieces of
revenue-raising legislation through the Commons this week despite Labour
disapproval of the speed with which MPs will debate the measures.
The government wants the bills - one reducing the statutory sick pay subsidy
to some employers, the other raising employees' National Insurance
contributions by 1 per cent - to go through all Commons stages by Thursday
night, and to be on the statute book early in the new year. It is not
unusual for legislation to pass through the Commons at this speed, but
Labour claims it is almost unprecedented so early in a parliamentary
session.
Last week, Labour vented its anger by ending the arrangement by which MPs
'pair off' with opponents so that both can be absent during divisions.
Mr Derek Foster, Labour's chief whip, believes this may make life difficult
for government whips, who will have to ensure that sufficient MPs are in the
Commons to vote the measures through. They may also have to take account of
some backbench unease about the impact of the measures. Today, the
government will introduce a 'guillotine' motion, proposing a limited debate
on both bills.
If this is passed, the Statutory Sick Pay Bill will be debated for no more
than six hours tomorrow, with MPs voting at 10 pm. The debate raising the
National Insurance contribution will go through the same curtailed
procedures on Thursday. Ministers said yesterday the sick pay and National
Insurance legislation had to be on the statute book quickly so that
employers could make provision for the changes. The measures will raise
about Pounds 2.5bn for the Exchequer next year. Ministers claimed that
Labour's decision to end the pairing arrangement was a bout of 'sour grapes'
following a failure to call for a separate Commons vote on the proposed
compensation package for VAT on fuel last week.
Labour MPs said the bills had to be rushed because of a timetabling mess
created by the Budget, which has left the government only four months
between last month's Budget and the implementation of some measures.
Labour also claimed that some of the legislation would be resisted by Tory
backbenchers.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Vocational training 'an epic disaster'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's new system of vocational qualifications is today attacked as a
'disaster of epic proportions' in a report by a group of leading academics.
Professor Alan Smithers of Manchester University's Centre for Education and
Employment Research says the national vocational qualifications (NVQs) and
general national vocational qualifications (GNVQs) are inferior both to the
training schemes which preceded them and to comparable courses in other
European countries.
The new qualifications are weak because they are geared solely to 'assessing
what students can do rather than what they know or understand', he says.
Mr Tim Boswell, the further education minister, interviewed for Channel 4's
Dispatches programme to be broadcast tonight, said the government would take
Prof Smithers' advice seriously.
'There will be some problems of course at the beginning,' he said. 'We are
always prepared to look at these and listen to practitioners, particularly
at the grassroots. But we believe that the broad structure is right and that
we can build on it to have a really powerful range of qualifications.'

FT  14 DEC 93 / Career union officials mooted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Union officials of the future could be career professionals, paid as highly
as the managers they face across the negotiating table, Mr Peter Wickens,
personnel director of Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK), has told the Commons
employment committee.
Young people could be recruited 'on the basis of their ability and interest
and that they can rise through the ranks by moving from one trade union to
another,' he said in written evidence to the committee's inquiry into the
future of trade unions.
He also criticised the move towards larger unions. 'It is ironic that at a
time when companies are actively devolving responsibility and
decentralising, trade unions seem to be becoming more monolithic.'
Mr Wickens urged unions to provide more training for their officers.
Officials should understand 'their members' contributions to productivity
and quality improvements and be able to formulate claims accordingly.'
Unions could have a role in redressing failures in vocational training, he
said. 'The voluntarist approach has not succeeded in establishing a genuine
commitment on the part of British employers.'
The unions should set a target that no young person aged between 16 and 18
should be employed without a guarantee of off-the-job training.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Brussels hits at generator over coal contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Power, the UK's largest generator, appears to be discriminating
against small, private-sector companies in five-year coal contracts
concluded last March, the European Commission's competition directorate
says.
Preliminary findings in an investigation by the directorate say National
Power is not justified in imposing a 10.5p per gigajoule difference between
prices it pays to state-owned British Coal and independent companies. A
confidential report by the directorate also finds that National Power
discriminates against opencast operators and in favour of deep mines in
allocating tonnages to private-sector operators.
National Power said yesterday it could not comment in detail on a report
which was not public. But it said it was confident that, when it had given a
full explanation, the commission would accept its position.
If the commission confirms its findings, the small operators are likely to
push for redress through the British courts.
The High Court is due to hear tomorrow and Thursday a separate dispute
involving National Power and South Wales and Monmouthsire Small Mines
Association over earlier contracts.
In the dispute involving National Power's existing five-year contracts with
independent producers, the commission's preliminary view says that the small
miners and blenders, who mix varying grades of coal, have been treated at
least as favourably as British Coal in the allocation of tonnages when they
are taken as a whole.
But it finds that National Power has disriminated in favour first of the
blenders and then the deep mines, both at the expense of the opencast
operators.
The report notes the commission has accepted the principle of a differential
between the price paid by generators to British Coal and independent
operators. This is because of additional costs associated with transport,
sulphur and investment when dealing with independent coal.
The commission's preliminary view is that the 10.5p gap is not entirely
justified but says it needs additional information to determine what the
differential should be.
It suggest the maximum should be 6.5p per gigajoule.
In a review of the commission's ruling, UK Coal, an FT newsletter, says
National Power may feel aggrieved in the ruling since it had done more to
protect the interest of private miners than other generators. However, the
differentials looked difficult to justify.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Vodafone granted fixed-wire licence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vodafone, the UK's largest mobile phone network operator, has been granted a
national licence to offer 'fixed-wire' services in competition with British
Telecommunications, Andrew Adonis writes.
Until now Vodafone, which has 1m mobile customers, has been forbidden from
building or operating a fixed network. It has been restricted to competing
with Cellnet, the mobile operator jointly owned by BT and Securicor, and
Mercury One-2-One, a joint venture between Mercury and US West.
Vodafone said it did not intend at present to compete head-on with BT. Mr
Terry Barwick, Vadafone's director of corporate affairs, said: 'The fixed
market is already highly competitive, and we intend to stick to what we do
best.'
The move follows a review two years ago which led the government to abolish
the BT/Mercury duopoly in the provision of fixed services.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Texan high-speed rail project near collapse
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Plans to build a Dollars 6.8bn high-speed railway linking the main cities in
Texas were on the brink of collapse yesterday after Morrison Knudsen, the US
construction group, decided to back away from a key element of the
financing.
The group said it had decided to withdraw its guarantee for an initial
Dollars 200m convertible bond offering because it was not prepared to take
the risk alone.
The project now faces missing a December 31 deadline for having in place its
first-round funding of Dollars 170m.
The Texas TGV, using technology developed for France's train a grande
vitesse, would have been the first high-speed system in North America. The
railway industry had hoped it would set a precedent for similar projects
across the US and Canada.
The railway was due to have been built by the Texas TGV Corporation, a
private-sector consortium comprising Morrison Knudsen and private Texan
interests.
GEC Alsthom, developer of the French TGV, and Bombardier, GEC Alsthom's
North American licensee, were to provide the technology.

FT  14 DEC 93 / US court ruling throws insurers into confusion
</HEADLINE>

   By GEORGE GRAHAM

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US life insurance companies are bracing themselves for an administrative
upheaval affecting Dollars 570bn of assets, after the Supreme Court ruled
yesterday that these funds must be managed in line with pension protection
laws.
The court said an insurance company must meet the fiduciary standards of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act for premiums paid by a group pension
plan, even when the money is placed in its general account.
Some insurance executives feared the ruling could oblige companies to set up
segregated accounts for their group pension clients, which would create
great difficulties in dividing the assets now pooled in their general
accounts.
Worries about the solvency of many insurance companies have led some pension
plans in recent years to ask for segregated accounts, but three-quarters of
the pension fund assets held by insurance companies are still pooled in
general accounts.
General accounts have been thought to be governed primarily by state law,
which in most cases says all policy-holders must be treated equally. The
federal act, though, can require additional protection for pension plan
participants.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Clinton sees 'danger' in health costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday warned that it would prove impossible to
cut social welfare spending without first attacking healthcare costs.
Next year, the US states, for the first time, would be spending more on
health programmes than on education, he said. This was 'a serious danger
signal' for the whole country.
His forum was a 'town meeting' on federal entitlements, at Bryn Mawr college
in suburban Philadelphia.
Mr Clinton came to office promising the end of 'welfare as we know it'. He
has already appointed a bipartisan commission to propose necessary reforms.
He has frequently spoken of the possibility of putting a two-year limit on
welfare payments, after which recipients would have to take public service
jobs.
But the main thrust of his largely unscripted, 45-minute lecture yesterday
was again on healthcare. Medicare and medicaid programmes combined, he
noted, accounted for about 30 per cent of the total entitlement budget,
second only to the 43 per cent consumed by social security payments to the
elderly.
Discretionary welfare spending, on the other hand, amounted to a mere 2 per
cent of entitlement spending, with an additional 4 per cent taken by the
food stamp poverty programme. The current average monthly welfare benefit,
he said, was lower in real terms than it was 20 years ago, and was only
costing more because of the growth in the number of poor people.
He quoted approvingly a Washington Post editorial yesterday which cited
medicare and medicaid as the 'real budget busters.'
From 1994-98, he said, the health care slice of the budget, in real terms,
was projected to rise by about 5.5 per cent and social security by 2 per
cent, against a 5 per cent decline in defence spending and a 2.5 per cent
drop in general entitlements.
In the current fiscal year, entitlements, dominated by health care and
social security, comprise about 47 per cent of the overall US federal
budget, versus 21 per cent for defence, 18 per cent for non-defence
discretionary spending, and 14 per cent for repayment of the national debt.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Menem gets his way on route to second term: John Barham on a
step forward for Argentina's president - and misgivings about its democracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Carlos Menem and his old rival Raul Alfonsn, in a ceremony
transmitted live on Argentine national television yesterday, signed an
agreement that opens the way for the fulfilment of Mr Menem's greatest
ambition.
He has been pushing with almost indecent haste to remove the 140-year-old
constitution's ban on successive presidential terms so that he can stand for
re-election when his mandate ends in July 1995.
In exchange for backing constitutional reform, Mr Alfonsn's Radical party
wins greater participation in government, Congress and the judiciary. The
divided and demoralised Radicals, realising that they have little chance of
winning the next elections, decided they had more to gain by negotiating
with Mr Menem than obstructing his ambitions.
The ceremony yesterday was the culmination of six weeks of negotiations
behind closed doors.
Congress must approve constitutional change by a two-thirds majority. Since
the Radicals and Mr Menem's peronists control more than 80 per cent of the
seats in Congress, approval by Christmas is almost a foregone conclusion.
Mr Menem is in such a hurry that Congress will have only five days of debate
before rising until March. Elections for the constituent assembly that will
rewrite the constitution are to be held then.
As part of their price for support, the Radicals also demanded a purge of
the nine-member Supreme Court. Justices are appointed for life, to insulate
them from political interference, but the opposition says the court lost its
independence after Mr Menem packed it with pro-government justices.
Mr Menem duly forced the resignation of two justices and a third promised to
retire in February. Last week, Radicals and Peronists agreed on their
replacements - one justice for each party and an independent.
For the pessimists, the horsetrading and negotiations in smoke-filled rooms
bode ill for Argentina's fragile democracy , the 10th anniversary of which
was celebrated last Friday.
It might be appropriate that the celebrations were uninspiring. There was a
rally in a sports stadium. Mr Menem and Mr Alfonsn planted 10 saplings in a
Buenos Aires park. Vandals uprooted them the next day.
There was no sign of the enthusiasm in December 1983 that had greeted Mr
Alfonsn's inauguration. That ended seven years of military rule which was
unusually brutal, even by Latin American standards.
However, most Argentines seem to approve the Peronist-Radical pact. La
Nacion, Argentina's leading conservative newspaper, is one of the few
dissenting voices. It protested in an editorial that 'a small group of men
whose only qualification is to have been designated by the two leaders (are)
discussing the text of Argentina's future constitution as if (theirs) was
the final instance of the reform process.'
It said this is being done with the 'evident intention of delivering the
constituent assembly a tightly-closed package' to be rapidly rubber-stamped.
Such secretiveness is a striking feature of Mr Menem's presidency and, to a
lesser degree, of Mr Alfonsn's years in power. Mr Menem has amassed more
power than any leader since Juan Peron ruled Argentina from 1946-55.
Peron was Argentina's only president to change the constitution and win
re-election. But he was toppled by the military, who scrapped the changes.
Mr Menem has drawn the teeth of the supreme court and the judiciary. He
ignores congress and rules by decree when necessary. He claims Argentina's
economic 'reforms would not have been possible without the presidential
system that we have'. These reforms have brought strong growth and low
inflation, further re-inforcing his popularity and authority.
The last 10 years have seen important advances. Civilian courts tried and
jailed generals for human rights violations in the 1970s, although Mr Menem
later pardoned them. The press is growing in confidence and aggressiveness.
The arts are flourishing. The military, discredited by its disastrous
1976-83 government, now proclaims its commitment to democracy.
Indeed, democracy has survived considerable stresses, such as four army
mutinies, 13 general strikes and the hyper-inflation of July 1989 that drove
Mr Alfonsn from office five months early.
While support for democracy and Mr Menem's market-oriented reforms has never
been stronger, Argentines complain that education, health, administration of
justice and employment opportunities have deteriorated since 1983 while
corruption is growing.
Six military coups since 1930, guerrilla warfare in the 1970s and 60 years
of economic upheaval have crippled the machinery of government. Democrats
argue that Argentina must consolidate stability by rebuilding its
institutions of state.
Political analysts say that, although Mr Alfonsn restored democracy and Mr
Menem brought economic stability, the latter is not the man to rebuild
Argentina's institutions.
Argentines often say their greatest hope for the future is the 'democracy
generation' of children born after 1983. These are supposed to grow up
untainted by the violent, bitter hatreds which have divided their parents
and grandparents.
If the Peronist-Radical 'tightly-closed package' is approved swiftly and
with little debate, Argentina will lose a fine opportunity to design new
political structures in order to help it avoid a repetition of its
blood-soaked history.

FT  14 DEC 93 / 'Flawless' mission over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seven US space veterans returned home to Cape Canaveral in triumph
yesterday, after completing all scheduled repairs to the crippled Hubble
Space Telescope.
'Thank you for the flawless flight,' mission control told them as the
shuttle Endeavour rolled to a stop. 'We look forward to using (Hubble) to
see further into our universe than ever before.'
The 11-day mission - which some commentators had called the greatest
challenge for the US space agency Nasa since the moon landings more than 20
years ago - was a very public success.
In the course of five televised space walks, the crew (average age 46)
completed all their scheduled tasks, surpassing Nasa officials' highest
hopes. They replaced or repaired 11 defective parts on Hubble, including
lenses to correct the telescope's short-sightedness.
Astronomers will not know whether the mission has restored Hubble's full
sight until Nasa has completed several weeks of tests.
The first images from the repaired telescope are expected in February.
Nasa was also keen to point out that the repair mission would bolster the
agency's credibility in arguing for at least Dollars 10bn from Congress to
build a permanent space station in orbit.
It showed how well astronauts can work in space, with miniature electronic
components and with bus-sized pieces of hardware such as Hubble itself.

Mr David Lange, former New Zealand prime minister, was appointed foreign
affairs spokesman in the shadow cabinet by Ms Helen Clark, opposition Labour
party leader yesterday, writes Terry Hall in Wellington. Mr Lange is widely
held responsible for a rift with the US, Britain and Australia from 1984
when he was foreign affairs minister and premier. Then, New Zealand banned
visits by nuclear-armed vessels, legislation over which led to the break-up
of the post-war Anzus treaty.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Mood darkens in Gaza's camps: Disappointed Palestinians vent
their fury as peace accord deadline passes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JABALYA CAMP, OCCUPIED GAZA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
It should have been a day of celebration marking the beginning of the end of
27 years of Israeli occupation of the crowded, impoverished Gaza Strip.
But instead, after Israel failed to meet yesterday's deadline under the
peace accord to start withdrawing its troops, crowds of Palestinian youths
vented their frustration in traditional fashion: lobbing stones and insults
at heavily armed Israeli troops stationed behind barbed wire fences.
In the sprawling rubbish-strewn Jabalya refugee camp, the birthplace of the
Palestinian uprising, youths in sandals and black and white headscarves ran
to the fences of Israel's military camp and sent burning tyres into the
compound. When soldiers in helmets and bullet-proof jackets moved towards
the stone-throwers and shot plastic bullets the youths clapped and whistled.
'I am not afraid to die,' said 17-year old Ahmed al-Hinawi, one of the
youths taunting the soldiers and holding a large rock in his hand. 'Death is
in God's will and if I die I will be a martyr.'
Two blocks away residents gathered to mourn the death of a Palestinian who
killed himself while training with a machine gun. Outside the concrete
breeze-block home pictures of Mr George Habash, leader of a Palestinian
faction opposed to the peace process, were festooned from the roof top.
Yesterday was business as usual in the strip although Colonel Shuki
Shichrur, deputy military commander, said the army had issued orders to the
soldiers to 'be sensitive' and prevent incidents or accidents. By the end of
the day three Palestinians had been killed and several wounded in separate
incidents across Gaza. One was shot dead as he tried to drive a stolen
ambulance booby-trapped with explosives into an army jeep.
'You can see how desperate people are,' said Mr Mansour al-Shawa, the
mayor-designate of Gaza City. 'The mood is filthy. People are really upset
and disappointed that the Israelis won't even stick to an agreement which
gives us virtually nothing.'
Mr al-Shawa said opposition to the peace process was mounting day by day.
'We thought we were on the way to regaining some of our dignity and
alleviating the pressures, misery and poverty, but now people feel cheated.
Many more people now are opposed to the peace. They say they prefer to live
under occupation than give up all their rights.'
The mood in Gaza was repeated across the occupied West Bank yesterday. In
Jericho, the designated capital of future Palestinian self-government,
Palestinians shut their businesses to protest against the delay in Israeli
military withdrawal. In Nablus soldiers also clashed with Palestinian
militants.
Palestinians and Israelis have warned that extremism is bound to grow as
uncertainty sets in about the future of the peace process. For the Islamic
fundamentalists and the PLO factions which oppose the peace accord, the
delay in implementation of troop withdrawal provided a rallying call to
disaffected Palestinians.
'You see. We can never have peace with Israelis,' said Mr Hisham al-Akra, a
21-year-old student who lives with 13 other family members in a four-roomed
shack in Jabalya camp.
Like many in Jabalya Mr al-Akra is a refugee who yearns after his ancestral
land now in Israel and who has little hope of returning home under the peace
accord.
'Even if the troops leave Gaza we will continue attacking them and Yassir
Arafat cannot stop that. We don't want this peace. We want to wait and
continue the struggle until we are stronger to win all our rights to our
land and the right of the refugees to return.
'The Israelis will never give anything. They show this every day. We will
have to fight them until we kill them all or send them back to the countries
they came from.'
The message is one many Palestinians find distasteful. But every day of
delay threatens to strengthen the hands of extremists to the long-term
detriment of a peaceful transition.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Land bill leaves Australians unclear where they stand: An
Aborigine rights law that pleases few
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Noel Pearson, a 28-year-old lawyer, tells a group of Australian senators why
he, and fellow Aborigines, negotiated a milestone land rights deal with the
government: 'It was a salvage exercise - a desperate salvage exercise.'
Michael Mansell, speaking for the more radical Aboriginal Alliance
Committee, tells the senators that the proposed legislation which has come
out of those negotiations and could be passed into law this week, would do
little to help his people. Worse, it could impede their rights in some
areas.
Both men are presenting their views in a Canberra committee room which, with
its air-conditioning and wood-panelling, is far from the scorched red earth
at the centre of this fight. There, everyone agrees, Aborigine communities
with rudimentary education and limited access to information, have little
hope of grasping the complex legal tussle that is going on.
'I can't say that half of Aborigines have any understanding of this bill,'
says Mr Mansell.
The Australian government's native title bill is also perplexing the
business community. Lawyers for the nation's mining and resource-based
companies have spent weeks scouring the wording and wondering whether money
poured into project development would now be secure from lengthy legal
battles.
'Let's put it like this. The lawyers haven't found any problems - yet,' says
one mining executive, when asked about the likely go-ahead for a stalled
multi-million-dollar deal. Summing up the general concern, Mr John Prescott,
head of BHP, Australia's largest industrial company, has likened the
legislation to 'reading porridge'.
For all the confusion, its significance is difficult to understate. In
simple economic terms, land-related industries are crucial to the nation's
prosperity. Mining and agriculture, for example, account for about 7.5 per
cent of gross domestic product and provide more than 60 per cent of
merchandise exports.
The native title bill represents an attempt by today's Australia to come to
terms with a less than glorious aspect of its past. When European settlers
first arrived in Botany Bay in the late 18th century, they worked on the
premise that land was uninhabited. This was despite an evident indigenous
population who were simply 'dispossessed'. This was compounded by decades of
shoddy treatment meted out to the Aboriginal community. A law prohibiting
racial discrimination came into force only in 1975.
Unemployment is high among indigenous people and social conditions are poor.
Tensions lurk close to the surface. The death recently of Daniel Yock, a
young Aborigine dancer who had been arrested in a Brisbane street brawl,
prompted riotous demonstrations, allegations of police brutality, and a
public inquiry.
The immediate catalyst for some form of native title legislation has been
legal rather than moral, however. Last year, the Australian high court
decreed that native title could exist where Aborigines had maintained a
close and continuing relationship with the land, although it added that land
titles acquired under accepted law since European settlement should not be
disturbed. The bill is an attempt to marry these two pronouncements.
In essence it provides for a system of 'validating' existing land titles.
Where this happened, and except in the case of mining leases, native title
claims would be extinguished. In the case of mining leases, native title
would be allowed to stand alongside an existing lease, then take over when
that lease expired.
However, where a genuine native title claim was extinguished, compensation
would be paid by state or federal government. A system of tribunals would be
set up to handle claims and adjudicate on compensation matters. Native title
holders or claimants would have negotiating rights over the land in question
but no veto right.
The compromise nature of the legislation means that its likely practical
implications please no one. On the Aborigine side, it is estimated that no
more than 10 per cent of the indigenous population would have any chance of
successfully asserting native title claims. In most cases, victorious claims
would be levelled against vacant Crown land, the largest amounts of which
lie in western Australia.
This makes all important the federal government's promise of a land fund to
help the majority of Aborigines who did not gain from the bill. 'The only
way my people in Cape York are going to benefit is via the land fund,' says
Mr Pearson, for example. But the dollar amount has yet to be spelt out.
Moreover, as more radical voices such as Mr Mansell's point out, even where
Aborigines do establish native title they would not get back everything
which the land holds. Mineral rights, for instance, would remain with the
Crown.
While the mining and pastoral industries know that government would pick up
compensation costs, this would not prevent long hearings to establish native
title rights. In theory, the private sector should be no more than a
bystander in this process; in practice, it would probably incur legal and
other costs.
Meanwhile, the ability of native title claimants or holders to negotiate
over developments may lead to unwanted delays. Such uncertainties - and
there are others - could affect the availability and cost of project
finance, it is argued. The nation's biggest mining companies warned this
month that the need to establish the native title position before beginning
exploration would divert the industry's investment abroad. 'You'll see the
exploration dollar vote with its feet,' says one executive.
And for the general public, there is the big unanswered question of how much
the compensation claims would cost, but the government refuses to be drawn.
One Treasury official has hinted that higher taxes may be down the road.
Opposition leaders have warned that the sums, including the land fund, could
be considerable; the government says it is impossible to assess, although it
expects that the number of successful native title claims would be limited.
Judging by opinion polls, this leaves the public as wary as everyone else
about the legislation's merits.

Philippine negotiations with Westinghouse Electric of the US to settle court
cases in the US and Switzerland over construction of a nuclear power plant
have collapsed, according to Mr Delfin Lazaro, energy secretary.
The negotiators described Westinghouse's position in the talks as 'contrary
to the country's dignity, interests and laws'. The Philippines will now
pursue claims filed against Westinghouse before the International
Arbitration Court in Geneva.
It will also appeal a case it had filed in a US court against Westinghouse
alleging the US company had used bribery to win the contract. The New Jersey
federal district court last May cleared Westinghouse of the charge. The
appeal will be filed on December 20.

FT  14 DEC 93 / N Korean leaders in power struggle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Signs of a power struggle were evident at the latest session of the North
Korean parliament held in Pyongyang late last week. The clash pits the
conservative old guard affiliated to President Kim Il-sung, 81, against a
younger generation of technocrats supporting Mr Kim Jong-il, the president's
son and designated successor, according to analysts.
'There is a generational conflict in all this,' said Mr Adian Foster-Carter,
director of the Leeds University Korea Project. 'The old guard are said to
fear for their prospects once Kim Jong-il takes full charge.'
A central point of dispute between the two factions is economic reform. The
conservatives believe that opening the economy to foreign investment will
undermine the stability of the government as North Koreans become exposed to
outside influence.
But the technocrats argue the North is in danger of economic collapse if the
country remains closed and sticks rigidly to the governing principle of
juche, or self-reliance.
The reformers appeared to carry the day at the latest parliamentary session
when they were given two or three years to restructure the economy,
including promoting foreign trade and light industry and agriculture at the
expense of heavy industry. This decision was accompanied by a report
admitting the economy faced serious problems.
But to mollify the conservatives, President Kim's younger brother, once
touted as a potential successor, was suddenly appointed a vice-president and
politburo member after an 18-year absence. Mr Kim Yong-ju, 71, disappeared
from view in 1975 after the president's son rose to prominence and was
proclaimed the next leader.
Some analysts believe Mr Kim Yong-ju may be appointed president, while Mr
Kim Jong-il will hold the more powerful positions of general secretary of
the Korean Workers' party and head of the armed forces.
'Splitting the leadership between President Kim's brother and son would
represent a balancing act to appease both the conservative and reformist
factions, while keeping power concentrated in the hands of the Kim family,'
said one analyst. President Kim has simultaneously held all three posts.
Other analysts discount speculation that the rise of Mr Kim Yong-ju
indicates President Kim is having second thoughts about his son assuming
power. Kim Jong-il still appears to be in charge of formulating policy on
the economy and other issues.
The two top economic posts were recently filled by those believed to be
reformers, including Mr Yun Gi-bok as chairman of the economic policy
committee of the Central People's Committee, the country's senior executive
body, and Mr Hong Sok-hyong as state planning chief.
Efforts to attract foreign investment have also accelerated in recent weeks.
The government has approved legislation allowing foreign bank operations and
foreigners to lease land and visit free trade zones without visas. This
follows introduction of a new foreign investment law last year that offered
tax incentives for joint ventures, although barriers remain on the
repatriation of profits.
South Korean and some western companies, such as Unilever, are studying
setting up light industrial plants in North Korea if the dispute over the
inspection of the North's nuclear facilities is resolved.
North Korea's interest in developing light industry using western aid would
enable it to provide consumer goods to the population in the hope of
retaining support for the government. It would promote the production of
goods suitable for export, such as textiles and electronic goods, as part of
the new policy to develop new overseas markets to improve foreign trade.
The renewed emphasis on agriculture in the new economic policy is meant to
overcome shortages in grain production that has cut food supplies and is
reported to have led to local disturbances.
Some analysts believe North Korea is using the issue of nuclear inspections
to win economic concessions from the west. The strategy may have been
adopted by Mr Kim Jong-il to prove his toughness to the old guard, while
promoting the goals of the reformers by gaining foreign aid in return for
allowing nuclear inspections.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China's aviation industry is in crisis after a spate of hijackings and three
air crashes this year, according to the country's civil aviation chief.
Mr Jiang Zhuping, head of the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC),
urged drastic measures to improve pilot performance and guard against
further disasters. He was quoted in the English-language China Daily
yesterday as calling for air safety to be an 'overwhelming priority'.
His comments coincided with the ninth hijacking this year of a Chinese
airliner to Taiwan, further compounding Beijing's embarrassment over its air
safety record. The hijacker commandeered the aircraft by pretending to have
a bomb in his pocket.
'Every airline, airport, navigation and maintenance unit will be checked in
the campaign to close safety loopholes and tighten discipline,' Mr Jiang
said.
He warned that those responsible for failing to uphold safety standards
would face criminal prosecution. Procedures at China's hard-pressed airports
are lax.
CAAC has sent inspection teams to airports and airlines throughout China to
check on standards. 'Poorly qualified pilots would either be demoted or have
their licences revoked,' China Daily said.
International aviation experts have long been warning that China's airline
boom (new airlines have mushroomed in the past few years to cope with a
surge in demand) has put an intolerable strain on resources.
The rash of hijackings to Taiwan has fuelled tensions between Beijing and
Taipei, with China alleging that the Taiwanese refusal to repatriate
hijackers was compounding the problem. In Taipei, Mr Jason Hu, Taiwan
government spokesman, mocked Chinese safety standards. 'In one of the
hijackings, a bar of soap was used. This time it's something in a pocket.
Next time a toothpick will do.'
China's air passenger traffic is growing by at least 25 per cent a year, the
fastest in the world. It now has 39 registered airlines.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A campaign is gathering momentum for government assistance to clear Japanese
banks' bad loans, as Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren, the
leading business federation, yesterday proposed public funds be used for
purchases intended to stimulate the property market.
The banks' losses are linked to the price collapse of their property
collateral, and fears are growing that the commercial property market will
be in free fall next year unless the government intervenes to support
prices.
However, Mr Hiraiwa's call for intervention was aimed not only at banks, but
also at the many non-financial companies which invested in property projects
during the late 1980s, the so-called bubble era, and are facing huge losses.
'Now seems to be the right time for the government to consider buying up
land,' Mr Hiraiwa said. His suggestion echoes proposals by other business
leaders for the government to buy land for public use, and even to purchase
property that will not ultimately be used for public purposes, if only to
stimulate the market.
The government is likely to consider advance land purchases as part of a
stimulatory package, for which preparation is expected to begin this week.
The Construction Ministry has indicated that it would like an easing of land
transaction taxes, but the Finance Ministry is likely to oppose any measure
that would reduce tax income.
Banks complain they have been unable to sell land held as collateral because
the property market is 'dead', while the rate of commercial vacancies in
Tokyo is estimated at 10 per cent and rising. In areas developed rapidly
during the bubble years, the vacancy rate is close to 50 per cent and the
determination of developers to complete projects is still adding to the
surplus of commercial space.
Demand for residential property has risen this year, but a study by the Real
Estate Companies' Association estimates that 81 per cent of apartment buyers
in the Tokyo area in 1988-92 are sitting on large potential losses.
The association calculates the average loss for an apartment bought in 1989
at Y12m (Pounds 73,500). This rises to Y22m for an apartment bought in 1990
and Y18m for a 1991 apartment.

Mr Jean-Pierre Elkabbach yesterday took charge of France's two
state-controlled television stations when he was appointed chairman of
France Television as part of the government's shake-up of the media.
Mr Elkabbach, 56, is known in France as an aggressive television
interviewer.
He is close to a number of prominent conservative politicians, notably Mr
Edouard Balladur, the prime minister. He co-authored a book with Mr Balladur
in the late 1980s.
The selection of Mr Elkabbach for such a sensitive position as the head of
France Television, which controls the France 2 and France 3 channels, has
been interpreted as an unashamedly political choice by the Balladur
administration.
Mr Elkabbach came to the fore in French television under the conservative
governments of the 1970s, when the state exercised stringent control of the
media.
He was so closely associated with the right that when the Socialists took
power in 1981 crowds chanted 'Elkabbach Resign]' at a victory rally.
However, Mr Elkabbach eventually became close to Mr Francois Mitterrand, the
socialist president, after collaborating with him on a television biography.
He takes over from Mr Herve Bourges.

The European Commission agreed yesterday to re-examine its proposed ban on
tobacco advertising, after EU health ministers had again failed to agree on
the controversial directive.
Mr Padraig Flynn, European health commissioner, said it was a 'matter of
great regret' that member states were unable to agree on a ban, which would
end all tobacco advertising in the European Union, except at the point of
sale.
The proposal has been fiercely opposed by the UK, which favours a system of
voluntary restraint, backed by a blocking minority of Germany, Denmark, the
Netherlands and Greece.
Lawyers advising the council of ministers yesterday disputed the
Commission's decision to press for a ban under single market rules in the EU
treaty. The Commission argues that, unless conflicting national legislation
is harmonised, publications containing tobacco advertising will not
circulate freely around the Union.
But the Commission and the Belgian presidency said yesterday they were
extremely surprised that the council's legal service had raised such
objections after two years of debate on the measure.
Mr Flynn said he could not comment on the possible options for the
Commission until he had considered the legal base for any new approach to
the problem.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Brussels looks to EIB first for infrastructure loans

The European Union should turn first to the European Investment Bank for
loans to fund heavy investment planned for transport, energy and
telecommunications networks, finance ministers agreed yesterday.
Mr Philippe Maystadt, the Belgian finance minister who chaired yesterday's
meeting of EU finance ministers, said the EU would have to consider other
means of funding trans-European networks only if the EIB had reached its
borrowing limits.
On Saturday, EU leaders confirmed that Ecu5bn (Pounds 3.8bn) of annual
spending on networks would come from the existing EU budget, and Ecu7bn of
loans and guarantees from the EIB and the new European Investment Fund. But
during the summit, some leaders and finance ministers - notably from Britain
and Germany - criticised European Commission proposals to raise an extra
Ecu8bn a year through the issue of 'Union bonds'.
If the EIB could provide the extra funds, it would provide a simple way out
of the potentially divisive debate about extra financing. Mr Maystadt said
yesterday the issue would be examined by the council of ministers, the
Commission and the EIB 'to deepen the analysis of the limits of EIB
involvement'.
He said Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, had designated Mr Henning
Christophersen, economics commissioner, to co-ordinate trans-European
networks policy.
Separately, ministers formally agreed the legally binding macro-economic
guidelines which will be the basis of economic convergence during the next
phase of European economic and monetary union, which begins on January 1.
The original draft guidelines were modified to take into account the
summit's conclusions. The agreed text suggests using new fiscal measures -
for example, environmental taxes - to fund a decline in social security
revenue.
The guidelines include a general call for lower interest rates, wage
restraint, lower budget deficits and lower government debt.

FT  14 DEC 93 / World Trade News: GM and Poland reach deal on car assembly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
General Motors, the US carmaker, reached agreement with the Polish
authorities yesterday to begin car assembly in Warsaw, in a joint venture
with FSO, the Polish state-owned carmaker.
The deal, reached after more than two years of negotiations, marks an
important step forward in the modernisation of the eastern European car
industry.
In the first stage, the venture will assemble up to 10,000 four-door Opel
Astra small family cars a year from SKD (semi-knocked-down) kits supplied
from GM plants in western Europe.
GM will send already-painted car bodies from its assembly plant at Antwerp
for final trim and assembly in Warsaw. Major components such as engines and
transmissions will be supplied from its plant at Bochum, Germany.
Production will begin in the second half of next year.
At first, GM will invest DM9.4m (Pounds 3.73m) to take a 50 per cent stake
and management control in the venture, which will have a workforce of about
250. It will invest a further DM10m within a few months, which will increase
its stake to 65-70 per cent.
Under the terms of the deal, GM envisages moving later to a more ambitious
second stage in which cars would be assembled from CKD
(completely-knocked-down) kits, which would require body welding and
painting to be carried out in Poland.
Output for the second stage could be increased to up to 33,000 cars a year
on three shifts with a workforce of about 1,000. This stage would increase
total investment in the project to about Dollars 60m (Pounds 40.2m). At
present, GM has 32 Opel dealers in Poland and is aiming to increase this to
about 50 next year.
As part of the planned co-operation, GM will take part in developing the
automotive components supply industry in Poland.
Last week, it announced that ACG, the GM group's automotive components
subsidiary, with two of its worldwide divisions Packard Electric and Inland
Fisher Guide, had signed a memorandum of understanding with FSO and its
affiliate ZEM-ELK to set up a feasibility study of the establishment of
joint ventures in components areas such as wiring harnesses, lighting, and
metal and plastic components.
GM said that several other ACG components divisions were also in discussions
with potential Polish partners, within the FSO group and outside.
As a further part of the deal, GM will advise FSO on measures to modernise
production of the Polish carmaker's present out-dated Polonez car range,
originally launched in 1978, the design of which dates back to the 1960s.
For the longer term, GM will assist in evaluating a replacement for the
Polonez, and it is understood to be examining the possibility of producing a
new low-cost car in Poland smaller than its present Opel/Vauxhall Corsa
supermini.
Mr David Herman, chief executive of Opel, said yesterday that 'Poland could
certainly be a good place to produce an entry level car.'
Fiat, the Italian carmaker, which recently completed the takeover of FSM,
the other former state-owned carmaker, already uses Poland as its sole
assembly location for its Cinquecento small car for supply to all European
markets.
GM said yesterday that as part of its assembly deal the Polish authorities
had agreed not to impose an excise tax on its local production. A 15 per
cent excise duty is charged on imported cars.
Mr Marek Pol, the new Polish industry minister, said that GM would be exempt
from paying profit tax waivers up to the amount of its investment of DM9.4m.
'There have been no inducements other than those regularly extended to
foreign investors,' Mr Pol said yesterday. But the contract gives assurances
that the Polish government will compensate GM for any losses resulting from
future changes in tariff and tax conditions.

FT  14 DEC 93 / Hamburg mayor accused of racism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The mayor of Hamburg was yesterday accused of stoking up racism by demanding
population quotas to bar non-Germans from moving into parts of Germany's
second-biggest city, Reuter reports.
Mayor Henning Voscherau told the newspaper Bild he wanted to stop the
creation of ghettos in poor neighbourhoods which were being 'threatened' by
inflows of foreigners.
'Whoever refers to 'threatened neighbourhoods' must know that he has
contributed to the anti-foreigner climate,' said government ombuds-woman Ms
Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen.
She said Mr Voscherau's comments were racist propaganda: '(They) show that
he is not ready to accept that the non-German population has long since
become an integral part of the Federal Republic.'
Mr Voscherau argued there must be limits to the proportion of foreigners
living in certain neighbourhoods. 'If you have a neighbourhood where 50 per
cent or more of the residents are foreigners, then it must be possible to
say that is enough,' he said.
Germany's 6m foreign-born residents, mainly labourers from Turkey and
southern Europe, make up about 7 per cent of the total population.

<TEXT>
Mr Jean-Pierre Elkabbach yesterday took charge of France's two
state-controlled television stations when he was appointed chairman of
France Television as part of the government's shake-up of the media.
Mr Elkabbach, 56, is known in France as an aggressive television
interviewer.
He is close to a number of prominent conservative politicians, notably Mr
Edouard Balladur, the prime minister. He co-authored a book with Mr Balladur
in the late 1980s.
The selection of Mr Elkabbach for such a sensitive position as the head of
France Television, which controls the France 2 and France 3 channels, has
been interpreted as an unashamedly political choice by the Balladur
administration.
Mr Elkabbach came to the fore in French television under the conservative
governments of the 1970s, when the state exercised stringent control of the
media.
He was so closely associated with the right that when the Socialists took
power in 1981 crowds chanted 'Elkabbach Resign]' at a victory rally.
However, Mr Elkabbach eventually became close to Mr Francois Mitterrand, the
socialist president, after collaborating with him on a television biography.
He has been regarded as the favourite to take charge of France Television
since Mr Herve Bourges, his left-leaning predecessor, announced he would not
stay on for a second term.
Mr Bourges, who implemented a radical cost-cutting programme at France 2 and
France 3, last week became France's ambassador to Unesco.
The appointment of Mr Elkabbach comes at a time of sweeping reform across
French television.
Mr Alain Carignon, the communications minister, is tabling legislation to
liberalise the broadcasting system.
His reforms will include relaxing controls over investment and renegotiating
the licence of Canal-Plus, the successful pay-TV channel.

FT  14 DEC 93 / UK wins 2.5% VAT for works of art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
British auction houses yesterday welcomed a European compromise covering
value added tax on antiques and art works, which should allow London to
maintain its competitive edge against New York in the lucrative world art
market.
European Union finance ministers ended 15 years of intermittent debate by
agreeing a common VAT system for second-hand goods, which covers everything
from Minis to Monets.
Under the complex compromise, works of art imported from outside the
European Union into the UK will be subject to a reduced 2.5 per cent VAT
until June 30, 1999.
Art works re-exported from the EU within two years of entry will be spared
the tax altogether.
Ministers have yet to decide when the directive will take effect.
The UK, centre of the European trade in antiques, currently exempts art
imports from VAT, encouraging non-European collectors to sell through
auction houses such as Christie's and Sotheby's.
Auctioneers and dealers had feared that in the interests of fiscal
harmonisation, EU ministers would force Britain to impose a heavier rate of
VAT on imports.
All other member states will have to impose a rate of at least 5 per cent on
art imports.
Britain's right to levy a lower rate could be extended beyond 1999 if a
special report to ministers by the end of 1998 concludes that increasing VAT
would hamper the competitiveness of the European art market.
Commission officials claimed that art works imported for sale in Geneva or
New York were subject to an average tax of some 3 per cent.
Christie's, which along with Sotheby's, dominates the international art
market, gave a guarded welcome to the proposals.
Sir Anthony Tennant, chairman of Christie's, said: 'We feel that this deal,
tenaciously negotiated by Sir John Cope (UK paymaster general), represents
the best solution possible to secure agreement and that it removes much of
the uncertainty surrounding the market in London. While we remain deeply
concerned about the position after 1999, we are pleased that there is to be
a review of the effect of an import tax before then. The net effect of these
new proposals is minimal in the short term.'
Mr Anthony Browne, a Christie's director, added that while the move was
welcome, Christie's would 'continue to argue vigorously that, if you set too
high a rate, it will damage the European art market'.
Sotheby's also expressed satisfaction. 'The 2.5 per cent until 1999 will
have only a marginal effect. We are pleased that the present uncertainty has
ended'.
Ministers also decided that VAT would be imposed only on the dealer's margin
on the sale of second-hand goods, rather than the full value, and that sales
of goods and art works between individuals would not be subject to VAT.
Certain member states will be exempt from elements of the new system during
a transition period.
Separately, ministers asked the Commission to continue studying the
harmonisation of withholding tax on savings, in spite of opposition from a
number of countries, led by Britain and Luxembourg, to any harmonised system
of savings tax.

A wave of strikes and protests by workers demanding overdue wages spread in
Bulgaria yesterday, Reuter reports from Sofia.
The Podkrepa trade union called ore and coal miners out on strike from
yesterday and said it expected the stoppage to attract a total of 25,000
miners by the end of the day.
The other strong labour grouping, the Confederation of Independent Trade
Unions which launched an ore-mining strike 13 days ago, said 20,000 strikers
were to decide yesterday whether to accept an agreement signed by the
non-party government and union leaders on Friday.
The Trud daily said yesterday the government had promised to transfer 283m
levs (Pounds 6m) to the ore mines.
But the Podkrepa mining federation said the union had demanded documents to
guarantee that government promises would be fulfilled.
'We demand a decision on which mines will be closed and our people must know
where they will work afterwards,' it said.
Delays in the restructuring of the pollution-hit ore mining industry, which
produces mainly lead and zinc, are widespread in the state sector where
unreformed enterprises are floundering.

reality - Weakening traditions and hard-nosed politics
</HEADLINE>

As the Japanese government agonised yesterday before announcing the symbolic
opening of the rice market, the country's department stores and supermarkets
were clearing their shelves for the annual displays of ceremonial rice cakes
for the New Year festivities.
Rice cultivation is still the basis of traditional events in Japan. Each
year the emperor plants rice seedlings in his private rice paddy behind the
palace walls and offers the crop to the deities in an imperial thanksgiving
ritual. White rice cakes and sake, a rice wine, are symbols of purity, often
used as offerings in Shinto and Buddhist ceremonies.
Japan's roots in rice farming are also given as a reason for its cultural
differences with the west. Japanese are said to be cultivators, who plant
and harvest a rice crop as a group and share the fruits of their labour.
Westerners, the myth goes, are hunter-gatherers, more individualistic and
more compulsive in that they eat what they kill.
However, the spiritual links between ordinary Japanese and the imperial
family and the farming culture are weakening and young people are becoming
ignorant of the symbolism of rice rituals. Farmers have had to lure
consumers with 'brand name' rice in garish packages.
In the past years, farmers' groups reached deep into Japan's past to conjure
images of the sacred importance of rice and of their role as the custodians
of the culture. But the inevitability of imports, and the fading of rice's
spiritual significance among ordinary Japanese, have encouraged farmers to
flex their muscles in search of a settlement of a material kind.
For the rice farmers who drove their tractors around Tokyo last week the
interest was more in the amount of compensation than the protection of a
tradition.
The argument against rice imports has also been supported by some
environmentalists who claim that the change in landscape that would result
from a reduction in the number of rice paddies would cause flooding during
the mid-year rainy period. Consumer groups, who oppose post-harvest
fungicide and pesticide treatment, believe foreign rice is unsafe.
For politicians dependent on the rural vote, compensation for farmers is
crucial if they are to maintain their appeal to the electorate. The size of
the imports - 4 to 8 per cent of domestic consumption over the six years
from 1995 - is so little that the rural landscape is more likely to be
affected by the modern civic centres and car parks demanded by politicians
as compensation for their areas.
Theatricals for domestic consumption have also played their part in Japan's
agonising over the rice issue. Mr Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister, flew to
Geneva last weekend in a last-minute protest. He followed a group of MPs
belonging to the Liberal Democratic party and Social Democratic party from
rice farming regions.
The government waited until almost the very last moment before the Uruguay
Round trade talks deadline to reveal its decision. Until then most officials
avoided a public debate and hoped to win public approval by simply stressing
Japan had to avoid being blamed for failure of the talks.
The enduring sanctity of rice in modern Japan has been a result of the
strength of the rural vote, a legacy of the 38-year rule by the LDP.
Uneven representation, where one rural vote is worth three votes in the
cities, supported the LDP's majority in spite of a declining farming
population. However, this is about to be changed by electoral reform, which
Mr Hosokawa hopes to implement during the current session of parliament.
The lifting of the symbolic ban will be good news for Japan's manufacturers,
who have faced international criticism for the country's trade surplus.
Business leaders, who hope that an opening of the rice market will take the
heat off export-oriented companies, have applauded Mr Hosokawa's decision.
Some in the business community hope that the benefits of cheaper rice will
be passed on to consumers and in turn boost sales of other goods.
Analysts estimate that imports of 4 per cent of domestic consumption in 1995
will result in a gain of Y178bn (Pounds 1.2bn) for Japan.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, overriding fierce domestic opposition,
said early today a reluctant Japan would open the country's heavily
protected rice market to limited imports and help clinch a Gatt world trade
treaty, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt chief, was quick to praise Japan's 'difficult'
decision, saying the move would help trade talks as they struggled towards
deadline.
After weeks of agonised debate, Mr Hosokawa's polarised coalition partners
finally agreed at 3.30am in Tokyo to back his plan.
'I have formally decided to accept the Gatt proposal (to open partially our
rice market),' Mr Hosokawa said after winning the endorsement of coalition
and cabinet. 'If Japan were to have rejected this plan, the Uruguay Round
would have collapsed and our country would have become the target of world
criticism.'
The decision to allow even limited imports almost split the country's
governing coalition. Until the last minute, the Social Democrats looked
deeply divided over whether to back Mr Hosokawa or support outraged farmers
who account for a big portion of the party's declining support.
The party, the largest but most unstable in the alliance, could have brought
down the four-month-old government if it had decided to quit the coalition.
That could well have held up a final agreement on a new world trade pact,
due in Geneva tomorrow.
However, after talks lasting nearly 12 hours, the party's top executive
grudgingly agreed to leave the decision to Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the
chairman, who said the Social Democrats must support the rice plan and stay
in the coalition.
Japan has agreed to import from 4 to 8 per cent of its domestic rice needs
from 1995, in exchange for a minimum six-year grace period before putting
tariffs in place of its import ban, as originally proposed by Gatt, Mr
Hosokawa said.
Japan would try to negotiate an extension of the grace period beyond the
sixth year to avoid imposing tariffs. 'The history of rice is the history of
Japan . . . so we made great effort to win an exemption (on the tariff
plan),' he said. 'Right now, we're not thinking that we should accept
tariffs in the seventh year.'

FT  14 DEC 93 / World Trade News: The gavel falls on most of Uruguay Round
</HEADLINE>

The whisper early on Sunday evening that Uruguay Round negotiators had
settled a fiercely fought row over a US bid to dilute international
restraint on the use of anti-dumping laws was a watershed at the end of an
otherwise fraught weekend.
After a low point on Sunday morning when Sir Leon Brittan, the European
Union's trade commissioner, talked of a crisis in negotiations with the US,
news of a breakthrough on the anti-dumping issue injected optimism. The view
among negotiators was that if an issue as apparently intractable as
anti-dumping could be resolved, then surely other outstanding disagreements
 -mainly linked with trade in services - must surely be resolved.
Late yesterday, the US and the EU remained at loggerheads on US access to
Europe's film and television markets, while US threats to exempt itself from
offering full most-favoured-nation status in financial services remained.
But, in the wake of an anti-dumping settlement, the gavel has fallen on most
of the Uruguay Round agreement.
A glimpse into how the anti-dumping clash was settled provides insights into
the carefully orchestrated fudges that have been needed in recent days to
bring the Uruguay Round deal close to completion, and to ensure that lobbies
back home see the gains, rather than the losses, that have been involved in
the process.
Of the 11 changes demanded by the US to the text of the Uruguay Round
anti-dumping agreement - which is intended to provide stricter international
discipline on dumping actions at a time of concern over their proliferation
 -US negotiators will tell their domestic audience that it has scored seven
out of 11.
Its key 'victory' has been to win agreement over 'standards of review',
where the US had been protesting at proposed new Gatt powers to re-examine
not just the handling of a dumping case, but the facts presented to it.
For opponents of the US proposals, there will be relief that demands for
stricter anti-circumvention rules have been rejected. Similarly, the
agreement will retain its 'sunset' clause forcing a dumping duty to expire
after a certain number of years. Concessions have been made to the US, but
these do not entitle the US to retain dumping duties indefinitely. More than
10 per cent of US dumping duties have been in place for more than 20 years.
Another important concession to the US has been amendment to the 'standing'
text which will entitle labour unions as well as companies to bring dumping
complaints to the government. US demands that the 'de minimis' clause be
amended have been agreed. These set levels at which imports are so
negligible that allegations of dumping will not be considered. However, the
US demand for the 2 per cent threshold to be cut to 0.5 per cent, has been
rejected. It will stay at 2 per cent.
'Trying to read this agreement is rather like reading goats' entrails,' one
dumping negotiator commented. 'We will all be looking at the same thing, but
the US will tell its domestic audience one thing, and others will tell their
domestic lobbies another.'
Japan, a fervent opponent of the proposed US changes, was licking its wounds
yesterday. One senior negotiator said: 'We did not want to touch the
original text, so we are not very happy about the outcome. But the political
reality is that the US needed support in Congress, so that was a concession
we have had to give to them.'
He insisted that the compromise outcome 'is at least less ambiguous than the
original US proposals'.
For Gatt negotiators, the compromise is historic: 'Every previous deal has
had to be imposed on countries with unreconciled disagreements,' he said:
'This is the first agreed text ever achieved in the area of anti-dumping,'
one said. Such are the climaxes to a negotiator's day.

FT  14 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Chipmakers try to scuttle push for Gatt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
US semiconductor makers are trying to scuttle the push for a final Gatt
agreement by urging Congress members to vote against ratifying it, unless
big changes are made on intellectual property rights protection.
'The entire industry will come down hard against Gatt,' Mr Craig Barrett,
chief operating officer of Intel, the world's biggest chipmaker, said.
Chipmakers charge that in its present form, the draft Gatt threatens their
ability to protect intellectual property rights, denies open access to the
European market and weakens US anti-dumping provisions.
Mr Barrett is angered by provisions that might force Intel to license its
patented technology to foreign makers. 'If a foreign government decided it
needed a chip industry, it could force us to license our technology.' The
draft Gatt proposal states that a patent holder must be paid 'adequate
compensation', but it is unclear how that amount would be calculated.
'Our only recourse would be to appeal to a Gatt panel; by the time the issue
was resolved, it could probably be moot,' because semiconductor technology
advances rapidly.
Passage of such measures could have a serious impact on the competitiveness
of the US semiconductor industry. 'It hardly motivates a company to spend
millions of dollars on product development if you are looking down a gun
barrel at people threatening to seize your technology.'
The US industry spends an average 12 per cent of revenues on research and
development. Intel has spent Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) developing its latest
line of Pentium microprocessors.
'In its current form, the draft Gatt hurts the US semiconductor industry and
threatens US jobs,' Mr Andrew Procassini, Semiconductor Industry Association
president, said. With nothing to gain from passage of the pact as it stands,
the SIA would oppose Congress ratifying it.
In addition to its objections to 'compulsory licensing', the US industry
views European offers to lower import tariffs on chips as 'totally
inadequate. The greatest tariff cuts occur in product areas exempt from
European duties because Europe grants waivers for semiconductors for which
there is no European competition. Europe is creating the illusion of big
tariff concessions, when the tariffs paid would change very little.'

Trade diplomats yesterday moved to squash concerns that the complex and
time-consuming tariff negotiations in the Uruguay Round of trade talks could
not be completed by tomorrow's deadline.
'We will have completed the substantive market access negotiations by
Wednesday,' said a senior trade official. 'What's on the table then will be
final and cannot be withdrawn.'
European Union negotiators caused consternation late last week when they
said they might be able to conclude item-by-item tariff bargaining with just
15-20 countries, representing about 90 per cent of world trade. On Sunday
the EU had definitively signed off on just one tariff accord - with Peru.
However, with the Uruguay Round rules package largely sewn up late on
Sunday, trade officials have been meeting round the clock to finalise deals
with trading partners covering thousands of farm and industrial products.
Intensive negotiations have also been taking place on opening markets for
services.
Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt director-general, said yesterday that tariff
offers could not be reduced but could be improved after December 15. 'That
process will be one of verification and augmentation,' he said.
Diplomats said it was not necessary for all 115 participants in the round to
bargain with each other. The biggest 20 to 30 nations will settle on tariffs
and then offer the same deal to others.
Smaller countries will be putting in tariff schedules based on their
understanding of the deal on offer as it concerns them.
Least developed countries have been given extra time beyond tomorrow's
deadline to prepare schedules.

FT  14 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Japanese premier secures coalition backing

<TEXT>
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, won the crucial support of a
key coalition party early today allowing him to unveil official approval of
Japan's plan to allow limited rice imports to help clinch a Gatt world trade
deal, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
Mr Hosokawa, after enduring weeks of hand-wringing and painful debate,
announced the decision after a 3am cabinet meeting.
The Social Democrats had looked deeply divided yesterday over whether to
back Mr Hosokawa on rice or support outraged farmers who account for a big
portion of the party's declining support.
The party, the largest but most unstable in the alliance, could have brought
down Mr Hosokawa's four-month-old government if it had decided to quit the
coalition.
Such a development would have certainly held up a final agreement on a new
world trade pact at the 115-state Uruguay Round of talks, due to wind up in
Geneva tomorrow.
However, after marathon talks lasting nearly 12 hours, the party's top
executive grudgingly agreed to leave the decision to chairman Mr Tomiichi
Murayama, who said the Social Democrats must support the rice plan and stay
within the coalition.
'We have had to accept that Hosokawa's decision (on rice) is right,' Mr
Murayama told a meeting of Social Democrat leaders.
'Our party's responsibility to help stabilise the government is increasing,'
he said as angry farmers protested in front of party headquarters in central
Tokyo.
The issue has traumatised the Social Democrats, who are increasingly
dependent on the farm vote as urban voters desert the hardline party in
droves.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, the foreign minister, who returned to Tokyo early yesterday
after a quick trip to Geneva to meet US and European trade officials,
defended the decision as unavoidable.
'Everyone agreed that failure to conclude the Uruguay Round will hurt the
global economy,' he said.
Mr Hosokawa may have cleared one hurdle but more troubles lurk around the
corner. The main opposition Liberal Democratic party had threatened to hold
a key budget bill hostage if the prime minister gave in on the rice issue.

FT  14 DEC 93 / EU acts to ease multiple share listings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European Union finance ministers yesterday approved a measure intended to
reduce the administrative burdens on companies seeking share listings on
more than one EU stock exchange.
The measure, which will be an amendment to the Listing Particulars
Directive, will allow companies listed on one exchange to use their existing
documentation as the basis for an application for another exchange. Before
becoming effective, the European parliament must give its opinion on the
issue.
Currently, companies seeking listings outside their home country must
prepare an entirely new set of documentation for a second listing, a
requirement which can discourage cross-border listings.
Mr Paul Smee, head of public policy and international relations at the
London Stock Exchange, said that while the amendment was not revolutionary,
'it is a first step towards cross-border listing. It is progress.'
It is expected the amendment will smooth the way for the Eurolist project
under which the 250 largest EU corporations will be able to obtain
cross-border listings. Eurolist will be open to those companies with a
market capitalisation of at least Ecu1bn (Pounds 760m), with annual turnover
of at least Ecu250m and which are prepared to seek a listing on at least
five European exchanges outside their home country.
However, the creation of Eurolist and the new listings amendment fall short
of what the London Stock Exchange has been seeking and what many regard as
essential to genuine integration of European stock exchanges.
Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, London Stock Exchange chairman, has called for mutual
recognition of listing requirements by EU stock exchanges. While the listing
and reporting requirements need not be exactly alike, stock exchanges should
agree to list the shares of those companies which have met listing
requirements in their home states.

FT  14 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Nigerian liquefied gas project to go ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A controversial Nigerian liquefied natural gas project which has been beset
by political and commercial uncertainty is to go ahead, according to one of
its main backers.
The multi-billion dollar project, one of the largest in the world under
consideration, has been restructured to emphasise private sector
involvement, according to Mr David Pearce, director of Shell International
Gas.
He told a Financial Times conference in Vienna yesterday that the
shareholding of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation in the project
would fall by 11 percentage points to 49 per cent.
Shell's share would rise by 4 percentage points, while that of Elf
Aquitaine, the French state-owned oil company, would increase by 5 points.
The International Finance Corporation, the private sector finance arm of the
World Bank, would take a 2 per cent stake. Agip, the Italian oil company,
was also a partner.
Mr Pearce said a significant amount of the planned equity in the project
would be placed in an escrow account to 'establish financial confidence'
among potential lenders. Shell is also assuming a larger role in the
management of the development. The need to re-bid contracts for the project
next year means it will not be completed before well into 1999.
The growing world demand for gas which has encouraged companies to embark on
projects such as that proposed for Nigeria was a recurrent theme among
speakers at yesterday's conference. Shell, for example, predicted a 50 per
cent increase in demand by 2010, excluding the former Soviet Union and
eastern Europe.
Most agreed that the strongest growth was likely to come in Asia. Mr Fritz
Voight of Exxon suggested that gas would remain the fastest growing fuel
there until 2010.
The optimism over steadily rising long-term demand was tempered, however,
with concerns over future prices, especially if oil prices remained low.
Many speakers noted that gas prices would have to rise substantially if
remote reserves were to be developed. But a rise in prices to the levels
needed to sustain such projects might undercut the competitiveness of gas or
lead to the abandonment of high volume, low value industrial markets.
