FT  17 MAR 94 / Malaysian PM says 'die is cast' over trade ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes of an early end to the Malaysian government's ban on trade with the UK
receded last night, when Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister,
said there would be 'no contracts in exchange for British Press freedom to
tell lies'.
In his most detailed explanation to date of the reasons for the ban, Dr
Mahathir says in a letter to the Financial Times that the 'die is cast'.
Malaysia decided three weeks ago to deny any future government contracts to
British companies because of its anger at British press reports of alleged
bribes offered to Malaysian politicians and disclosures of a link between a
Pounds 1bn defence contract won in 1988 and Pounds 234m of British aid for
the Pergau hydroelectric dam. The contracts freeze could cost UK companies
hundreds of millions of pounds in lost business.
Dr Mahathir says: 'If you have scruples, don't sell arms at all . . . When
arms are sold, long-term payments or offset programmes or special terms are
invariably offered by everyone.'
He adds: 'It has never been proven conclusively that it (the Pergau loan)
was for the arms purchase.'
He also says that the benefit for Malaysia of receiving the Pergau loan at a
subsidised interest rate, of 0.8 per cent, was 'marginal'. Malaysia could
have got similar terms from other countries such as Japan, he says.
If the subsidised loan had not been offered for Pergau, work on the dam
'could have gone to non-British companies'. The leading contractors on the
dam are the British construction groups Trafalgar House and BICC.
Dr Mahathir is convinced that the British media portrays Malaysians as
'corrupt' because 'they are not British and not white'. He continues: 'The
allegation against the Malaysian prime minister has turned out to be
baseless.'
He singles out The Sunday Times, which alleged that Malaysian politicians
had been offered bribes by the construction company Wimpey, for attack: 'The
Malaysian prime minister need not subscribe to that even as Andrew Neil
(editor of The Sunday Times) did not accept reports on his affair with
Pamella Bordes.'
Mr Neil said last night: 'The letter betrays a very confused mind.' He said
Dr Mahathir had not addressed the allegations made in last weekend's Sunday
Times that the Pergau loan had indirectly enriched Malaysians close to the
government, because it had been paid to an electricity company which was
privatised soon afterwards.

Foreign secretary Douglas Hurd told Conservative MPs he was not prepared to

veto. Hoping to unite the Tory party behind a compromise, he said
enlargement was a policy in Britain's national interests. Ministers are
still fighting to prevent the number of votes needed to block legislation
from rising from 23 to 27. Mr Hurd is understood to have told backbenchers
that '23 is best'.

FT  17 MAR 94 / Retail sales fall sparks calls for interest rate cuts:
Unemployment declines as earnings growth picks up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unemployment resumed its downward path last month, but a sharp drop in
retail sales prompted calls for another cut in interest rates to help the
economy weather next month's tax increases.
The number of people out of work and claiming benefit fell by a seasonally
adjusted 38,800 in February to 2,751,800, or 9.8 per cent of the UK
workforce, the lowest level since June 1992.
But retail sales dropped 0.5 per cent in February, dragging the year-on-year
growth rate down from 3.7 per cent in January to 2.5 per cent, the slowest
rate since May last year.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said it was time for an immediate
reduction in lending rates.
'The figures undermine bank and government optimism about the recovery,' he
said. 'Retail sales are falling even before taxes have gone up and the
government must act now to prevent further damage to the economy.'
But Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, vigorously defended the tax increases
as necessary to keep the recovery going.
'We have a background of a large amount of borrowing, as does every other
country coming out of the recession,' he said.
According to Mr Clarke, the government's programme for dealing with the
budget deficit will enable the economic climate to carry on improving, keep
inflation down, and allow interest rates to remain low.
But yesterday's mixed set of figures also included the first pick-up in the
annual growth rate of average earnings for two years. This affected
sentiment in the government bond market, where investors grew uneasy that a
long period of subdued wage rises was coming to an end.
The underlying rate of growth of average earnings in January was 3.25 per
cent, higher than the 3 per cent analysts had expected. The June long gilt
future fell 1 1/4 points on the news to 110 25/32 . Shares also fell
yesterday, with the FT-SE 100 index falling 24.5 points to 3,242.9.
Overall, the official retail sales figures painted a less downbeat picture
than a survey from the Confederation of British Industry earlier this week
which showed two successive months of slowing retail sales growth. The
official figures, from the Central Statistical Office, included a sharp
upward revision to January's month-on-month increase, from 0.6 per cent to
0.9 per cent.
The employment figures showed that January's unexpected increase in
unemployment was revised even further upward, from 15,500 to 19,800.
Generally, the figures from the Department of Employment suggested many of
the jobs being created are not in traditional areas. A rise in the number of
the self-employed was the main cause of the increase in employment in the
fourth quarter of 1993. Manufacturing employment continued to decline, while
the quarterly Labour Force Survey showed a continuing shift to part-time
employment.
Mr John Prescott, the shadow employment secretary, kept up pressure on the
department to alter the way it measures unemployment by saying that the
current figures gave a misleading impression of the true state of the labour
market. The employment department's chief statistician had, according to Mr
Prescott, admitted that changes to the count since 1979 had removed at least
400,000 from the official figures.
'That alone would push the official unemployment rate up to 11.2 per cent,'
said Mr Prescott.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: BA separates out engineering side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Airways is setting up its engineering activities as a separate
profit centre next month in an effort to reduce the airline's overall
aircraft maintenance and engineering costs, as well as expand engineering
services to other carriers.
The engineering and aircraft maintenance activities employ about 10,000
people out of BA's total 50,000 strong workforce and include facilities at
London's Heathrow airport and in Wales, where BA overhauls Boeing 747 jumbo
airliners and recently opened an aircraft avionics repair and maintenance
centre.
The engineering activities headed by Mr Alistair Cumming are also expected
to be strengthened by imminent management changes to boost the company's
engineering management team.
BA's engineering operations have seen significant growth over the last three
years. The company, which outlined yesterday its plans to its unions to
transform the engineering business from a cost centre into a profit centre,
sees strong potential for further growth in aircraft maintenance and
engineering services.
Already about 15 per cent of BA's overall engineering activities involves
work for other carriers and the airline hopes to develop this third party
business through its latest reorganisation.

London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures maintained Monday's enthusiasm
early on, the May position peaking at Dollars 1,325 a tonne. The rally
quickly ran out of steam as a sluggish New York market helped to take the
wind out of London's sails but the May price held on to Dollars 10 of its
rise to close at Dollars 1,316. COCOA'S rally also continued, with nearby
prices touching three month highs late in the day.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Carlson Companies of the US and Accor of France are pooling their business
travel operations in a joint venture, Carlson Wagonlit Travel (CWT), which
they plan to develop globally for their corporate clients.
With more than 4,000 travel agencies in 125 countries providing Dollars
10.8bn in revenue, they said the joint venture would have 8 per cent of the
world business travel market, 20 per cent ahead of their nearest rival,
American Express.
Through their combined purchasing power and synergies in computer
reservation systems and in developing a new travel credit card, the CWT
joint venture is aiming for a cheaper service for corporate clients.
The CWT joint venture will be 'a real working union, not a paper
partnership,' claimed Mr Travis Tanner, president of Carlson Travel.
However, the two parent groups will keep their respective hotel activities,
and even in business travel only envisage a full merger after their joint
activities are working smoothly.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Honesty urged over failure in Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A leading British charity yesterday called for 'an open acknowledgment of
the scale of sub-Saharan Africa's development fail-ure'.
In a strongly-worded attack on the World Bank's latest report on the region,
Oxfam said that bank-supported structural adjustment programmes had failed
to 'generate sustainable growth and significantly reduce poverty'.
The charity, which is heavily involved in Africa, declared that adjustment
programmes 'were preoccupied with lowering inflation through interest rates
and unrealistic money supply targets.
'Poorly planned and sequenced import liberalisation measures' had 'exposed
potentially competitive local industries to ruinous competition from
imports' Oxfam said in its statement.
The British charity accused the bank of 'complacency' in the face of what it
called Africa's 'deepening development crisis'.
The charity also attacked the bank's classification in its report of
Zimbabwe as a successful adjusting country as 'bordering on outright
deception'.
Zimbabwe's adjustment programme did not come until operation until 1991,
says Oxfam: 'Since when there has been no sign of recovery in investment or
export growth'.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Spanish workers prepare to fight Suzuki cutbacks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The future of Suzuki's Spanish subsidiary remained in doubt yesterday after
workers flatly refused to negotiate drastic job cuts demanded by the
Japanese company.
Suzuki told union leaders it intended to reduce the labour force at its main
plant in Linares by 70 per cent from 2,437 to 941. The company also plans to
reduce production of the four-wheel drive vehicles that the factory produces
by 50 per cent to 25,000 units this year and to impose a two-year wage
freeze.
Earlier this week Suzuki said it would drop a threat to close the plant if
unions agreed to job cuts. Santana, which is some 80 per cent owned by
Suzuki, applied for receivership last month saying it had sustained
accumulated losses of Pta21bn (Dollars 151m) in the past three years.
Union leaders said Suzuki had delivered a 'take it or leave it' ultimatum
which was completely unacceptable. They said there was no point in further
talks and that they would now concentrate on mobilising the Linares area in
southern Spain, where Santana represents the sole industrial activity and
provides for more than 30,000 indirect jobs.
The anger in Linares has been fuelled by the failure by both Suzuki and the
regional government to implement an agreement signed last year. Suzuki had
agreed to wage increases of between 4-6 per cent and to raise output to
50,000 units a year, while the authorities had promised subsidies.
The Santana union leaders are understood to be preparing big demonstrations
in Madrid at the weekend when the ruling Socialist party meets to holds its
national congress. Yesterday, plant workers put up road blocks around
Linares and temporarily occupied government offices in the nearby provincial
capital of Jaen.
The future of Santana, which previously made Land Rover vehicles, has been
in doubt since early last year.
The issue came to a head when the company filed for protection from
creditors on February 18, provoking fierce public reaction in Linares and
the surrounding region.
The strength of the Santana protest against the parent company Suzuki has
created concern in the government about its possible impact on the climate
for foreign investment in Spain.
The dispute has also generated political worries, with regional elections in
Andalucia less than three months away.

Weak links mean big risks - System security / As increasing amounts of data
are moved around the world, the need to maintain security integrity has
become paramount
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BANKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a direct relationship between the number of information tools used
by a company and the chances of its information system being insecure.
A singleton PC used at home can be the victim of the occasional virus, which
is often irritating to the user but rarely fatal to the system or the
information. For a company with multiple, linked networks of PCs,
workstations, departmental servers and enterprise repositories, however, the
potential risks can border on the incalculable.
The PC has moved from being little more than a toy used for tactical
personal productivity applications to become one of the key strategic tools
for delivering meaningful information to users. As such it has moved
centre-stage in the on-going struggle to keep information secure and systems
up and running.
The problem is, of course, that the PC's history contains nothing to
associate it with the concept of security. As security consultant, Robert
Schifreen, suggested, even DOS, the PC's native operating system, can be
readily re-written to make the machines a source of secure information.
'For example, it is possible to embed code in the operating system that will
log all keystrokes made on a PC,' he says. 'In that way, log-in sequences
and passwords can be recorded for later use.'
As increasing amounts of sensitive data are moved around the world using
datacommunications technologies, the need to maintain security and integrity
becomes paramount. This not only affects how users should view the weak
links in their information systems - predominantly the PCs being used - but
also security at a higher level.
Until now this has started to look like a problem solved. The US Government
is, however, currently considering throwing what many see as a large spanner
in the works, in the form of what is generally referred to as the Clipper
Chip technology.
Currently, many companies regularly employ a data encryption technology
known as DES (the Data Encryption System). This is one of several
alternatives that are, ironically, published specifications. This would seem
to degrade their value, but as Schifreen put it: 'Everyone knows how DES
works, but it is not easy to crack. It can be done, but it would need a team
of programmers a year and a Cray supercomputer to do it. By being a
published specification everyone knows the weaknesses of DES and works to
plug them.'
The US Government is currently considering an alternative to these
encryption systems, based around a hardware chip, known as the Clipper Chip,
which would contain the encryption algorithm. A company using the chip would
then be able to pass encrypted data to any other using the same system.
What has upset users, according to Schifreen, is the fact that the US
Government is considering passing use of this CIA-developed encryption
technology into law. All US datacommunications users would then be legally
obliged to employ Clipper, which would mean that recipients around the world
would also be obliged to use it. What makes the situation worse is the fact
that Clipper is a proprietary system, and that the CIA has written a back
door into the technology allowing information to be decrypted.
The fear is that, either through theft, or the actions of a disgruntled
employee, this code could fall into the wrong hands. Another fear is that,
because it is from the CIA, the backdoor code may be made available to other
national authorities.
Perhaps most important of all, however, is that because it is a proprietary
solution, its method of working and its weaknesses remain unknown. As all
encryption systems are ultimately breakable, this is being seen as a serious
potential weakness of the system.
As PCs become more prevalent as a strategic tool, other weaknesses may serve
to compound the potential problems of Clipper encryption. For example,
access control on PCs is still a weak area, though there are now products
available to solve the problem, if companies are willing to make the
investments necessary. This may be significant, for the most comprehensive
solutions can cost up to Pounds 1,000 per PC.
Many new PCs come with access control available as standard, but these tend
to be simple password systems where the password is stored in a
battery-backed CMOS memory. Removing the battery, therefore, will normally
circumvent the password.
Investment in security is a key factor not always considered by users. This
starts with education about the simplest access issues. For example, it is
rare for thought to be given to individual passwords and most people make
obvious choices. 'Many users choose words like FRED, SECRET, PASSWORD and
LETMEIN,' Schifreen said, 'which are easy to guess.'
Even Unix systems, increasingly popular both as workstations and servers,
suffer access control weaknesses. For example, there is a well-known bug in
Unix Mail which will allow embedded code in a mail message, which runs when
the message is read. The code can, for example, request the system to
transmit the receiver's password file back to the sender.
It can also be used to transmit a complete system's password listing. This
contains user IDs and their apparently safely encrypted passwords. There
are, however, shareware products available - such as Websters, a program
with 234,000 unique English words - which, when passed through the Unix
encryption algorithm, will produce a table against which the encrypted
passwords can be compared, and cracked. Using numerals in passwords usually
helps solve this problem.
Many such routes into systems can be trapped with sufficient thought and
planning by users. For example, an increasing number of these programs are
now available from Bulletin Board Systems, so access by staff to such
systems must be closely monitored, particularly on the larger networks. One
way of doing this is to audit the applications being run.
There is now a new class of application appearing that scans all the disks
on a network to locate and report on all applications found. This should
include those that are hidden behind filenames that do not include the
standard applications file extensions such as . exe, .com and . bas.
In this way, systems managers can know the location of all approved
applications, as well as those that are not approved. The benefits of this
are two-fold. Not only are potential security risk applications identified.
It also ensures that no illegal copies of applications are being used,
preventing possible legal action by the application's authors.

New paging system for Dutch prisons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WILTSHIRE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Dutch group Teletechnicom and the Swindon-based company Blick Telefusion
have won a contract to upgrade potentially life-saving radio-paging systems
installed in Dutch prisons.
Since 1986, the two companies have held the contract to supply radio-paging
systems to 30 of the 45 prisons in Holland. But an unprecedented series of
attacks on prison guards forced the Dutch ministry of justice to put out a
tender for a more sophisticated system to be developed.
Hostage situations have resulted in serious injury and even loss of life.
The new paging system is marketed abroad under the title, Bodyguard.
Location signals can be sent out by the pagers each time a guard passes one
the many location code transmitters installed in prisons buildings.
The pagers also register the last two loctions of the user in case of
emergency and loss of contact. This data is relayed to a computer terminal
programmed to show the location of all guards, using a schematic display of
the prison.
Others features include a 'man down' alarm, triggered by a floating mercury
switch, a silent hostage alert button.

Quicker calls for Whitehall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPT Communication Systems has won a large order from the Central Computer
Telecommunications Agency (CCTA) for the supply, installation and
maintenance of a new computerised telephone directory serving all 62
government departments in Whitehall.
The new system enables operators based in the Treasury to reduce response
times significantly for about 5,000 enquiries each working day.
Mr Peter Spencer of the telecommunications division of the CCTA, explains:
'With over 30,000 people working in more than 60 different departments, our
original system of using up to 12 paper directories had become too slow and
cumbersome, with an average response time of 25 seconds - too high for what
is essentially a public service.'
The new system allows the CCTA to locate individuals and redirect calls in a
fraction of the time, eliminating caller-frustration, he adds.

Pioneering with the cordless office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WILTSHIRE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While most office workers are still 'tied to their desks' by fixed
telephones, a new generation of cordless telephone systems is set to open up
a market worth up to Dollars 5bn a year by 1998, according to Ericsson, a
pioneering company in this sector.
Ericsson began developing business cordless phone systems in the mid-1980s
andclaims to be the first company to launch a DECT-based system, last year.
This Freeset system works as an 'add-on' to a company's existing phone
network. Low-powered radio base-stations are installed throughout the
premises, and controlled from a radio exchange, which connect directly to
the host telephone system. The main groups of users are organisations with a
large number of mobile staff - such as hospitals, factories and exhibition
centres - where instant communication is important.
The second main group of users are companies which are trying to redefine
the nature of office work, applying the 'hot desk' principle. Digital
Equipment Corporation, using the Freeset system, has been successfully
experimenting with a similar concept which it calls 'the natural office' at
its Swedish offices in Stockholm.
'Once people start using a cordless phone at work, it's impossible to take
it away from them,' comments Ericsson's Hans van der Hoek. In five years'
time, he expects one-third of all business phones sold will be cordless.

Most finance directors are dissatisfied with data management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WILTSHIRE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite the widespread acceptance of information technology, more than half
of the finance directors in a recent poll of top companies are still
dissatisfied with the quality of their current information management.
This is one of the findings of a survey by the independent research group,
MRD, which targeted financial directors from 100 leading companies in the
UK.
While more than half the companies are now using their own internal IT
department's resources to develop their strategies for information
technology, only 13 per cent say they use an external IT resource.
Together, these companies represented an investment in IT of more than
Pounds 175m.
The survey, commissioned by European Software Publishing (ESP), says that 98
per cent of respondents felt that personal computers had made their work
more productive, but the time-factor - not 'technofear' - was seen as the
greatest restraint on the wider use of technology.
'Even though the technology is sitting on their desks, still relatively few
managers are using the communications and information-sharing capabilities
of information technology,' adds the report.
'Large amounts of their day are spent in communicating - meeting,
telephoning, and so on - with their workgroup colleagues, but few are fully
using technology to support and enhance these activities.'

Finding solutions takes time - Fast software development / Object-oriented
computing is widely acknowledged to be the future direction for software
development. But discovering ways to build software fast is a painstaking
process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the ultra-competitive business world of the 1990s, a company's ability to
create new information systems rapidly is a pre-requisite for survival.
The key is to find ways to build application software which are both
flexible and scalable. Object-oriented computing, which sees an information
system as a set of self-contained components, is the most promising approach
and it is steadily gaining favour with both software developers and users.
Fast software development is a priority for both groups. A survey of
delegates to last October's 'Objectworld' conference in the UK, for example,
cited 'flexibility to change' and 'reduced time to market' as the two main
reasons for adopting the object-oriented.
Object-oriented computing is widely acknowledged to be the future direction
for software development and most software developers have pledged their
allegiance to the cause. The Object Management Group (OMG), an industry
organisation which promotes object-oriented computing, now claims 370
members and points to growing attendance at shows and exhibitions.
The object-oriented approach is making the running at both extremes and is
central to any debate on speeding up the production of software.
There are several reasons:
Firstly, object-oriented systems are built from sets of components which can
be re-used elsewhere.
This speeds up the development of new applications and makes existing ones
easier to maintain.
Secondly, object-oriented systems operate in a way that makes software
'portable' to other platforms and preserves investment in application
software.
Thirdly, objects reduce the complexity of applications software by enforcing
tight design disciplines.
Most importantly, object-oriented development techniques make it easy to
build prototype systems to demonstrate to users - which is widely
acknowledged as one of the keys to speedy application development.
'I think rapid application development is as much about the approach as it
is about the tools you use,' says Mr Vic Morris, UK managing director of
tools specialist Powersoft.
'As far as possible you want to break the application down to make it easier
for end users to do it themselves.
'If you look at what many users have done with their PCs - building complex
applications with spreadsheets, for example - you can harness that talent,'
he goes on.
Thinking of applications in terms of objects is the key, according to Mr
Morris.
'In the past, we viewed applications as a set of functions like, say, an
order processing system. It was very structured. Now with objects, we can
think in terms of business processes and put in place applications which can
support them,' he explains.
Mr Morris also places emphasis on the 'scalability' of applications. This
means, for example, an application program built for two or three users on a
small network should be able to cope with hundreds - or even thousands - of
users on a much larger system.
'We have recently re-positioned our Powerbuilder tool set to reflect this.
So you can start with a cheap desktop version and move up to a full
networked version and keep the same applications,' Mr Morris says.
Other tool vendors have taken a similar approach because it can speed up
production of larger systems if you can start with small ones and 'scale'
them up.
'All our tools are based on Smalltalk so you can move from our desktop
product Enfin to our corporate Synchrony product,' says Mr Jeff Sutherland,
vice-president of object development at software tools company Easel.
'But it is not enough just to scale up to a large number of users. You need
greater access to database and tools which can deliver the performance.
'We see the answer in tools which will do 80 per cent of what a user wants
automatically. The users can then concentrate on the bits they understand
best - the business objects,' he says.
Mr Sutherland believes that not enough is being done to promote object
technology at the application level. He is part of a group of software
developers pushing for the specification of business-based 'objects'.
'We have a problem at the moment with object-oriented technology. People
talk a lot about code re-use - but where is it?
'We see the need for re-usable business objects which can give different
views of the way the business operates to different users,' says Mr
Sutherland.
There are other, more serious, reservations about the use of object-oriented
design for speeding up software - initially, at least.
'Although object-oriented is the way forward, it is not a panacea. It's a
solid framework to build re-usable code,' says Mr Paul Burford, a systems
engineer with object-oriented tool specialist Next Computer.
'In the short term, it is not a quick way to get more out of programmers.
Although it reduces the number of lines of code you need to produce, there
is much more design input needed'.
Mr Burford cites the example of the Swiss Bank which used Next's Nextstep
object-oriented tool to build its systems.
'When we started at Swiss Bank four years ago we wrote objects that were not
re-usable so there was no advantage. But they recognised over time that they
had chunks of re-usable software,' he says.
'If you take a new environment it will never be quicker to start with
because of teething problems. But by taking an object-oriented approach you
have a chance to start putting in new features in a more natural way'.
While object-oriented design techniques provide a suitable framework for
building applications, the real productivity benefits come from software
tools.
Strategies for selecting development tools differ - according to the size
and data processing heritage of the individual company.
Larger companies tend to bring in programmer productivity tools so that
their information systems departments can respond more rapidly to users'
demands.
Smaller companies give their users their own desktop tools. Many companies
combine both of these approaches.
The result is a growing demand for tools which can support fast software
development and there is no doubt that these tools will use object-oriented
computing as a starting point.
What is clear, however, is that finding ways to build software fast, takes
time.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (28): A
central link in the chain - Factory of the future / Most of Britain's
leading manufacturing companies expect to invest heavily in information
technology in the next five years, reports Andrew Baxter. The most popular
planned investments are manufacturing management systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After 20 years of dramatic developments in the information technology used
by manufacturers - from the earliest computer-aided design systems to modern
relational databases and shopfloor management systems  - there is no let-up
in the pace of change.
Information technology (IT) vendors still see plenty of opportunities to
fulfil the changing needs of manufacturing companies, while the customers
are reacting to the disappointments of the past by taking steps to ensure
their IT needs really are met in future.
It is partly because of past disappointments, and the fact that previous
investments are no longer compatible with newer technologies, that spending
on IT by manufacturers remains a high priority.
According to a MORI survey last month for the ASK Group, developers of
business software, and the accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, 82 per cent of 100
companies picked at random from the UK's top 1,000 manufacturers expect to
invest heavily in IT in the next five years - and 60 per cent of managers
expect to spend more than Pounds 1m.
The most popular planned investments are manufacturing management systems,
where 73 per cent plan to spend money, and supply chain systems to improve
performance, where 62 per cent expect to invest.
This year's Computers in Manufacturing Show, at the National Exhibition
Centre, Birmingham, from November 22-24, will demonstrate some of the
state-of-the-art IT products seen by industry as a priority for their
broader business needs. Examples are virtual reality and rapid prototyping
tools to improve and accelerate product development, and just-in-time
software which allows manufacturers to operate lean production techniques.
These and other technology developments now becoming available provide some
clues as to what will be the IT needs of the factories of the future.
Mr Graham Williams, managing director of AT&amp;T Istel's manufacturing
division, believes the next five years could be exciting because of the
products which IT vendors are offering industry in order to help to tackle
key manufacturing problems.
The need for manufacturers to get closer to consumers has spawned the
concept of the extended enterprise in which not only suppliers, but also
distribution, is included. For example, says Mr Williams, IT can be used by
brewers as a means of viewing the hop-grower and also the public house as
part of its enterprise.
Similarly, the generation of electronic point-of-sales data can produce a
works order, and in turn create all the orders for materials and
sub-assemblies. This would aid the lean production process, as manufacturers
would only be making what their customers were buying.
All the technology to do this exists, says Mr Williams. Indeed, it is
already happening to some extent in the food industry, and will start to
happen very quickly in the process industries.
Mr Cliff Shuker, managing director of AT&amp;T Istel's Rover division, sees an
increasing need for IT applications that can be applied horizontally across
processes rather than simply used to improve the performance of individual
functions or departments.
Also, as customers increasingly dictate what happens in factories, they will
use IT to inject their requirements straight into manufacturers' production
schedules. Moreover,the development of massive databases provides the basis
for neural networks which can aid decision-making by tapping into past
experience.
IT users in manufacturing, too, have been thinking about the next steps in
their use of manufacturing technology. The most important initiative among
users is the AIT project - advanced information technology in design and
manufacturing - which is headed by Daimler-Benz and stems from users'
demands for more effective IT and better integration of systems at different
sites.
The pilot phase for the project, which comprises 16 aerospace and automotive
companies from six countries, began last November and the overall aim is to
strengthen the competitiveness of key European industries by three
consecutive action in three areas.
First, the initiative will seek to establish a consensus among European
industrial users of IT on their most important future requirements for
design and manufacturing.
Secondly, it will seek an agreement on these requirements with the IT
vendors, and, thirdly, an IT research and development initiative will be
launched to support the commonly-agreed requirements.
Significantly, the initiative's backers say they want it to become a
substantial user force recognised by the IT community, to ensure that future
products meet users' requirements.
Two other projects, combining users, vendors and universities, underline
further priorities for the development of IT in the factories of the future.
Just before Christmas, Crawley-based Reflex Manufacturing Systems, a
subsidiary of Rolls-Royce Aerospace, won approval from the European Union
for a project under the Esprit programme known as Discrete Cell Control.
Over the past five years, the adoption of manufacturing cells has grown
rapidly in industry because of their contribution to flexible manufacturing,
reducing work-in-progress and enhancing teamwork and multi-skilling.
Helped by an Ecu 1.3m Esprit grant, project leader Reflex and its partners
will, over the next 18 months, develop an open applications framework aimed
at providing a firm foundation for all cell control systems.
Reflex, a software house which specialises in manufacturing control and shop
floor scheduling systems, says the DCC will provide the means to design and
build systems, and empower autonomous cell operation, while enabling the
cell to co-operate with other production and engineering teams.
Mr Terry Jones, managing director of Reflex, says the aim is a standard cell
control environment which different IT suppliers can plug into efficiently.
Internal and external customers would also be able to view where their
products are in the cell.
The applicability of DCC will be evaluated through pilot projects at two of
Reflex' partners in the scheme, Intracom, the Greek electronics and telecoms
equipment company, and the Odense Shipyard in Denmark.
Odense, which has moved to cell manufacturing to produce super-tankers is
also involved in a project being carried out under the auspices of the
five-continent Intelligent Manufacturing Systems Initiative. This aims to
work out how concurrent engineering - interdisciplinary teamwork to
accelerate product development - can be carried out in a global
manufacturing context.
TransTec, the Birmingham-based specialist engineering group, is leading the
European side of the project. Like the Reflex project, it aims to design an
architecture - in this case of a CE system for global, multi-site
application.

The Picasso system
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AT&amp;T's Picasso still-image phone, above, allows users to send full-colour,
TV-quality still pictures, using an ordinary phone line - while
simultaneously talking over the same line. The system, priced at Dollars
3,295, takes about ten seconds to transmit a single image. The intended
market is for engineers and other professionals needing fast transmission of
detailed images.
The device looks like an office phone, but contains a data modem and
transceiver. To transmit a picture, users plug in a video camera, photo
compact disk player or digital still cameras. On the receiving end, a
computer monitor or TV set displays the picture.

Interaction of created worlds - Virtual Reality / Optimists see virtual
reality as offering a richer form of communication, but pessimists see it as
a disturbing retreat from the grimness of real life. Here, Philip Manchester
looks at one of the likely growth markets of the next decade
</HEADLINE>

Many advances in computer software have their origins in play. From the
early chess programs, which were used to demonstrate the power of electronic
brains in the 1950s, to the multimedia shoot-'em-up video games of today,
programmers have used games to push the envelope of software technology.
Advances in high-resolution graphics, data compression, animation and user
interface design have often been pioneered in games software before making
the transition to business. Games and other leisure-based uses of computers
have also laid the ground rules for computer-generated, alternative worlds
or what has come to be called virtual reality (VR). This new strain of
software now promises to open exciting applications in business.
'One way to see VR is as a magical window on to other worlds from molecules
to minds. Another way to see VR is to recognise that in the closing decades
of the twentieth century, reality is disappearing behind a screen,' writes
Howard Rheingold in his book, Virtual Reality.
It could be argued that anyone who sits in front of a computer all day to do
their job, already spends much of their life in VR. Even a simple program
like a spreadsheet can be engrossing enough to its user to suspend physical
reality.
The convergence of computers and communications pushes this even further.
Bulletin board systems and networked chatlines are now well established in
the US and growing fast in Europe. Network services like the Internet, CIX
and Compuserve have created a multitude of widely-dispersed, electronic
communities, each with their own culture. The phenomenon has spawned a new
language, a literary sub-genre (cyberpunk) and the idea of an ultimate
virtual nirvana called cyberspace.
There is, of course, not just one virtual reality, but many. At one extreme,
it is possible to become immersed in VR by using an enclosed helmet with a
built-in display and sensor devices which can pick up body movements.
At the other end of the spectrum, a serious desktop flight simulator such as
Microsoft's package for the PC, can be just as convincing.
VR purists argue that immersion is the only genuine VR experience and there
is research into all-over body suits which can take this to its logical
conclusion. The aim is that such a suit should act both as sensing device to
transfer body movements to the computer and also to convey a sense of touch.
Sensor suits to transmit body movement are already available. At the Virtual
Reality Expo show in London in February, for example, the UK company Virtual
Presence launched a 750 gram, Lycra suit equipped with 96 sensors, and there
are others available in the US.
Work is also under way to build systems which can respond to objects in VR
and transmit this sensation back to the user. Researchers at the University
of North Carolina, for example, have built a device which can be used to
manipulate images of molecules with a full feedback system. The Argonne
remote manipulator (ARM) is used to explore possible combinations of
molecules for new anti-cancer drugs. If the properties of the molecules do
not allow them to fit together, the resistance is conveyed back to the user
as a physical force.
There is also some speculation in fringe literature about the possibility of
direct connections from the human brain to VR systems - thus eliminating the
need for a suit.
At a more mundane and practical level, less intrusive VR software is now
within the reach of the PC user - mainly for games - but increasingly for
other activities such as mail order shopping or travel planning. Desktop
computers are now powerful enough to handle high-quality, three-dimensional
graphics and convey an impression of space. It is now possible to walk
around buildings which do not exist, fly a jumbo jet through a thunderstorm
and visit places on the other side of the world without leaving your desk.
The concept of VR has, of course, been around for some time. The
well-established flight simulator, for example, has been used for training
pilots since the early days of flying. More recently, simulated environments
have been devised for other training activities - such as working in
hazardous environments.
What marks out the new generation of VR software is that it goes beyond
merely representing the physical world - like a flight simulator - or
creating a possible future with a spreadsheet. VR enables the creation of
worlds which do not exist and allows interaction with them.
This has spawned a generation of software tools which can help to visualise
data in new ways.
Superscape, a VR tool from the UK company Dimension, has been used, for
example, to show the effects of drugs on the human body. The software allows
a user to navigate around a representation of the body and see the effect of
a drug down at the molecular level.
'The market is only now becoming aware that VR products are available for
low-cost computing. Once their eyes are opened to it, the ideas come rushing
in. We have about 30 applications built with Superscape and most of them
have come from customers,' says Mr Ian Andrew, managing director of
Dimension.
In addition to the drug simulation VR, which is being used by SmithKline
Beecham, Superscape has been used to build VR environments as diverse as a
telecommunications network simulation for British Telecom and an exhibition
modelling system for Dragon Exhibitions.
Although Superscape can support the more exotic VR peripherals, such as
headsets and sensors, Mr Andrew says that the demand is for applications
which are non-immersive and based on the desktop: 'Immersive VR was what
caught people's imagination in the first place - but most people are
uncomfortable with it. I'd say 90 per cent of what we do is for the desktop.
But we have left room to support the other devices and can offer users an
upgrade path when they need it,' he explains.
Faberushi, another UK VR specialist has built a multimedia virtual
exhibition system (VES) which re-creates the sound, look and feel of an
exhibition floor. Virtual visitors to the show can walk up to a virtual
computer screen and see a demonstration of a product.
'The interaction between people and machines is what is important about VR.
It lets you create spatial relationships which is very appealing - people
understand the rules of space,' says Mr Perry Huber, a consultant with
Faberushi.
'Proper VR allows you to move around in free form - like surrogate travel.'
Mr Huber also sees VR changing the way we use computers and improving the
user interface: 'One of the obvious things in the business environment is
that you can get way from simple graphical user interfaces. The three
dimensionality lets you bring a context to data and visualise it better.'
Data visualisation in three dimensions might seem far fetched. But imagine
explaining what a spreadsheet program could be used for ten years' ago.
VR offers the same potential to change the way data is viewed and presented.
Software developers are already experimenting with the possibilities. Maxis,
a US software company, has built a VR package which simulates the Wall
Street Stock Exchange in the form of a casino. Prospective investors can
risk their funds and enjoy themselves at the same time.
The market for VR products like these is expected to grow quickly over the
next few years and an increasing percentage of revenues will come from
commercial applications. Market researcher Frost &amp; Sullivan (F&amp;S) forecasts
a growth rate of 65 per cent a year in the US market, with revenues
exceeding a billion dollars by 1997.
Leisure-based applications are expected to dominate throughout this period
and show the largest growth. Another US market researcher - 4th Wave -
estimates that 70 per cent of 1993 revenues for VR products came from the
entertainment sector and this will increase to 76 per cent by 1997.
But commercial applications of VR technology on the desktop are likely to be
the most profitable - with training, data visualisation and computer-aided
design leading the way. Specialised commercial applications which can
harness the power of VR software will sell at a premium.
The parallel growth of high bandwidth telecommunications and multimedia
technology - both of which provide the infrastructure for VR applications -
promises to make the market for VR software one of the most exciting growth
areas into the millennium.
VR could also precipitate change in wider context.
The pessimistic view is that it will lead to the disturbing future described
by Aldous Huxley where people hide from the grimness of the physical world
at the 'feelies'. The optimistic view is that VR will enable humans to find
a richer form of communication, unimpeded by the laws of the real world.
One thing is clear, an increasing amount of communication between humans
will be mediated by computer software and, even when this is not called VR,
that is exactly what it will be.

The City gives its backing - Success for a VR software developer

<TEXT>
The business opportunities that virtual reality software technology can
offer were underlined recently by the public flotation of the UK company,
Virtuality Group.
It came to the London Stock Exchange in October 1993 with a share price of
170p, valuing the company at Pounds 44m and turning its founders into
multi-millionaires, writes Philip Manchester.
Since then, the share price has doubled and Virtuality is seen as a hot
investment.
Started as W Industries in 1987 in the classic computer industry style - in
a garage on the outskirts of Leicester in the UK - Virtuality earned
revenues of about Pounds 5m last year from sales of VR equipment and
software, placing it among the world leaders of the emerging VR industry.
Its customers include Matsushita, MCA Universal Studios and games company
Sega.
Virtuality has also attracted investment funds from IBM and Motorola, and
has ambitious plans in the VR software industry.
Co-founder and managing director Dr Jonathan Waldren is reported as saying
he wants the company to be the Microsoft of VR.
Virtuality's current products are at the high end of the VR market. The
company concentrates on what it calls leisure products - although its
definition includes education applications, as well as advertising and
promotional tools.
Virtuality's primary product is an 'immersive' arcade game machine which
sells for Pounds 25,000 upwards.
Sega plans to install Virtuality games in the 'super-arcades' it is building
world-wide.

new world on your desktop - Clever software helps cut the cost of virtual
reality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER

<TEXT>
One of the most important recent developments in Virtual Reality (VR) is the
fall in prices of hardware and software packages.
VR systems demand large computer resources and high-quality input and output
 -which has been expensive until recently.
But advances in hardware technology, such as faster PC processors, larger
capacity storage and graphics software have made desktop systems possible.
The most important element is the clever software which is needed firstly,
to build a virtual reality to suit a specific need and, secondly, allow a
user to visit and inter-act with it.
UK-based software developer Dimension sees a growing opportunity in the
emerging commercial market for VR tools on the desktop.
Its Superscape package, which sells for around Pounds 3,500, can be used to
build specific VR environments on a desktop computer.
The package has a broad range of users from British Telecom, which has built
a virtual network with Superscape, to the Shepherd School, which is using VR
to help children with learning difficulties.
One of the more exciting applications of Superscape is Tyne and Wear
Development Corporation's creation of VR model of the Pounds 180m Quayside
development in Newcastle.
The VR Quayside is being used to view how the development will look in
advance and sell it to prospective investors.

The clear message: innovate or perish - Technology developments in Canada /
Canada's successful IT companies demonstrate that to survive they must be
show greater speed and originality than their US competitors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
When you live next to a country as large as the US and want to succeed in
the information technology sector, you have to innovate to survive.
That is the story behind Canada's best personal computer and
telecommunications companies - which seem to win new business by creating
specialised solutions for surprisingly common challenges.
Take the success of Canadian personal computer fax software maker Delrina,
which hit the world markets in a big way with its WinFax software for
Microsoft Windows, a few years ago. Many companies had tried to produce
software which allowed users to fax documents direct from their PC screens,
but none had ever really achieved much success with it until this Canadian
company came along.
By closely identifying a need for simple design, low cost and an ability to
work with dozens of popular personal computer fax modems, Delrina almost
created the market for Windows-based fax software. Today it dominates that
market. It has been successful in building on the reputation of WinFax with
a range of form-design products and fax add-on systems, and operates in a
number of countries including a subsidiary operation in the UK.
Likewise, the Toronto-based Vivid Group identified at an early stage the
potential of 'virtual reality' technology. Using its implementation of this
idea, it started building entertainment and education systems.
Today, the company's Mandala System, an interactive virtual reality product,
allows users to indulge in a variety of 'virtual' experiences including
virtual ice hockey (something guaranteed to make it a big hit in Canada),
virtual volley ball or soccer, and even a virtual swim in the shark-infested
waters of Australia's Great Barrier Reef. The Vivid Group recently won the
ultimate accolade for its virtual reality technology when it was selected to
provide a key element of Paramount Pictures' Virtual Star Trek Transporter
Experience.
According to The Computer Paper, the founder and publisher of Canada's
largest computer publication, many successes of this kind do not stay
Canadian for very long. Douglas Alder, who founded The Computer Paper seven
years ago, says that moderate success is quite commonly followed by US
corporate acquisition.
He says that even raising initial venture capital is a tough slog for most
Canadian developers and entrepreneurs. 'There just aren't enough
millionaires in Canada,' he says. And even when Canadian companies do
achieve moderate success, there is no 'peer group of aspiring billionaires'
willing to spend the money, time and energy to help grow the Canadian
companies - 'most companies don't make it,' Alder says.
And when they do make it, they often become American companies in due
course. Take the case of SoftImage, the Quebec-based computer animation
specialists, recently acquired by US software house Microsoft for Dollars
130m.
In this case, SoftImage will be allowed to stay in Quebec and pursue its
existing business - while its technology will also be incorporated in future
Microsoft products.
Microsoft has been quite active in the Canadian technology sector. In 1991
it purchased Consumers Software, another Canadian company, and turned it
into its first big North American research and development facility outside
the United States.
Based in Vancouver, it now employs more than 100 people and has been renamed
Microsoft Workgroup Canada.
'We see a bright future for Canadian business and the local personal
computer industry,' says Mike Maples, executive vice-president at Microsoft.
'The Canadian personal computer hardware and software market is one of the
most advanced in the world.'
But being a Canadian personal computer hardware manufacturer is a tougher
business. Ask, for example, Benjamin K. Tam, president and chief executive
of Burnaby, British Columbia-based Darius Technology.
Tam has been making and selling personal computers in Canada for more than
six years, but admits that it is a tough market - particularly when many
Canadians can shop quite easily for US computers over the border.
Tam says that the recent Canada/US/Mexico North American Free Trade
Agreement (Nafta) does not make this job any easier.
'In the Canadian market, we are affected by the economic situation of our
giant neighbour, the US, as well as by the agreements and government policy
of the Canadian government,' he says.
'Nafta could affect us severely in the high technology sector. Although we
are known to be strong in the telecommunications side, we are not at all
competitive (in the computer market) because the sheer volume is not there
in Canada.'
One solution has been to sell recently-developed products, including a
network file server system based on Digital Equipment's powerful Alpha AXP
computer processor, in both the US and Canada.
As a result, Tam now boasts that 22 per cent of his company's annual sales
are in the US, with the rest in Canada. And in the near future, he is
expanding to the Far East - a move becoming increasingly popular among
Western Canadian companies.
Tam recently signed a Dollars 1.5m joint venture agreement with a
state-owned enterprise in China. It will begin manufacturing computer
displays in Shanghai this summer. Tam says that these products are being
made for both the Far East and North American markets.
In short, while Canada has the resources and the talent to create
world-class high technology companies, it may have to move quite quickly to
sell products outside its borders if these talents are to survive.
With a domestic market of only slightly more than 25m people, spread over
thousands of miles, this is perhaps not surprising.
In terms of land mass, Canada is the second-largest country in the world -
and distribution costs can be high. But judging by the successes of Delrina
and the Ottawa-based Corel Corporation (developer of the popular Corel Draw
software and now owners of the Ventura Publisher desktop publishing
suite)Canadian companies can succeed on the world market.
The secret is to be there from day one.

Potentially large market in the longer term - Like so much pioneering
technology, the first generation of these small devices has largely failed
to meet user-expectations - but a wave of improved products is on the
horizon / Tom Foremski highlights advances in personal digital assistants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) and personal communicators represent the
next big computer market, and for some industry observers, possibly the last
of the potentially large market categories for computers.
These small computer devices represent the logical progression of computer
technologies as they move from the desktop, to portable computers, to the
lap-top and finally to the so called palm-top. But like much pioneering
technology, the first generation of these devices have so far failed to meet
user expectations.
However, there are encouraging signs that the second generation of products
will overcome some of the problems.
Apple Computer was the first to coin the term 'PDA' which is rapidly turning
into a generic name for small computers with communications capabilities.
Tandy, which sells the Zoomer, sometimes uses the term 'personal information
assistant,' while IBM and AT&amp;T prefer the term 'personal communicator.'
They all describe a small computer that can be comfortably held in the hand
or slipped into a jacket pocket, with a touch-sensitive screen with a pen or
stylus input device and wireless communications capabilities for sending and
receiving electronic mail or faxes and transferring files to a desktop
computer.
A typical PDA will include software that consists of a word processor, a
diary for scheduling appointments, and a database to store information such
as phone numbers and addresses.
The first PDAs to hit the market were the Apple Newton MessagePad, Tandy's
Zoomer and AT&amp;T's Eo Communicator. Each has taken a slightly different
approach but all are united by the fact that their sales have been far short
of stellar.
The Newton MessagePad represents the most ambitious technology. It includes
sophisticated handwriting recognition software that turns the 'digital ink'
that is written by the user with a special stylus, into computer text. While
the handwriting recognition technology is state-of-the-art and works better
than most previous handwriting recognition technologies, its performance has
not impressed most users.
The handwriting recognition of the Newton fails to recognise many words,
resulting in a sometimes comical re-interpretation of the users words, as
satirised recently in the Doonesbury comic strip.
The Newton also has problems with foreign languages, especially German where
average word lengths are 10 characters instead of the six characters average
for English words. Newton has also been faulted for its communications links
which do not perform as well as expected.
The Tandy Zoomer, also marketed as the Z-7000 by Casio, has avoided, to a
large degree, the quagmire of handwriting recognition. It cannot recognise
cursive writing but it does have a very limited ability to recognise printed
characters. It prefers to store images of the user's notes instead of
performing the difficult handwriting interpretation.
The AT&amp;T Eo Personal Communicator packs more technology into its sleek box
than Newton or Zoomer, but it is twice the price. Unlike the others, it
includes a 20-megabyte hard drive that allows it to store much more
information. But it suffers from a short battery life - about two hours -
and you really need to upgrade the machine's memory to use its fax and
e-mail communications features.
All the leading PDAs have been criticised for being too slow and they all
use different operating systems which makes it difficult to produce a decent
number of software applications.
The Newton has its own proprietary operating systems, the Zoomer uses the
Geos software from GeoWorks, and the Eo device uses the PenPoint operating
system.
This multiplicity of operating systems makes life difficult for software
developers. They have to try to guess which device will sell enough units to
create a large enough potential market to justify the expense of
applications development. And without sufficient quantities of third-party
software, the PDAs face a limited appeal.
Despite the initial problems that have beset the first-generation PDAs, the
second generation devices promise improvements and new features that will
make them more useable and hopefully will fulfil the large unit sales
expectations of market researchers.
Apple, for example, is redesigning the Newton to add better communications
capabilities, and an improved operating system. Handwriting recognition is
also improved but, in what is an admission of a less-than-perfect system,
the next Newton will have the option to store images of a user's notes
without converting the handwriting to computer text.
AT&amp;T, stung by the disappointing sales of the Eo Communicator, is
redesigning the system, lowering the price and making it more of a mobile
telephone with computer features.
Other leading computer companies are also planning PDA introductions. Compaq
Computer, Motorola, IBM, and Sony are just a few of the big companies that
will introduce PDA-type devices later this year.
IBM's plans include a variety of PDAs designed for specific tasks, such as
one model equipped with voice recognition for dictating documents and using
a pen-input device for editing. Another IBM PDA is designed for e-mail
communications, allowing users to hear messages spoken in a
computer-generated voice and to dictate a response.
PDAs could benefit greatly from a standard user interface. General Magic, a
Silicon Valley-based company, earlier this year unveiled its Magic Cap user
interface which is specifically designed for PDA devices with communications
capabilities. The Magic Cap interface features a tiny graphical user
interface using a buildings metaphor. Users navigate through the systems to
reach different applications by choosing different types of buildings such
as a post office, for example, to send messages.
Magic Cap is designed to work with on-line services such as Compuserve or
AmericaOnline and specialised on-line services that use the companion
Telescript technology. Because of the small storage capabilities of PDAs,
on-line services are becoming a key factor in the success of PDAs. They will
offer data storage services to PDA customers and also carry e-mail and
faxes.
AT&amp;T recently announced its PersonaLink on-line service that will support
PDAs, and Apple's eWorld on-line service will support Newton users.
It is said that you can always recognise the pioneers by the arrows in their
backs and although the first generation of PDAs collected a fair number of
arrows, it is only a matter of time before the next generations become
ubiquitous and useful devices.

How automation cuts the invoice paper chase - Document image processing: two
case studies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Matching invoices to orders and goods-received documents tends not to be a
favourite job or a high priority for business people, writes John Kavanagh.
British Gas North Eastern, which has six districts and a Leeds headquarters
receiving 200,000 invoices a year from 8,000 suppliers, has automated the
paper chase with document image processing and has reaped considerable
benefit.
Paper movement has been drastically reduced, people holding up the process
have been pinpointed and cash flow has improved.
The paper chase used to involve an order document going to a supplier and a
copy being signed off as the goods-received note when the items arrived.
Invoices were sent to the finance department in Leeds, which passed them to
the relevant districts to be matched against the goods-received notes. These
notes and the invoices were then returned to Leeds for the details to be
keyed into the payments system. The documents were finally recorded on
microfilm.
Mrs Christine Kelly, invoice supervisor, recalls: 'There was paper flying
about everywhere.'
The invoice unit installed software from Image Systems Europe on its
existing office network of ICL personal computers and Novell network
software, which was already used for basic office automation such as word
processing and spreadsheet processing.
The PCs were fitted with large screens to display full images of documents
and two Fujitsu scanners and three Sony optical disc systems were added, all
supplied by Image Systems Europe. One of the optical disc drives is reserved
for copying each day's work, for back-up.
Goods-received notes and invoices are all scanned in as they are received
from districts and suppliers. The order number is keyed in and stored with
each document as the main reference point: an order number includes a code
representing the district which made the order.
The amounts on the invoice are also keyed in and put through a validation
program to ensure, for example, that the figures add up and that the VAT has
been calculated correctly.
This information has to be keyed in because document scanning systems handle
complete images and cannot recognise individual parts of different documents
to capture an address or total figure.
When the system receives an invoice it uses the order number to search for a
matching goods-received note. If it does not find one it automatically
directs a query to the relevant district office where staff can access the
central optical disc system through their own PCs.
Matched invoices are passed automatically to the payments system on the
region's ICL mainframe computer. The mainframe link is also used to retrieve
information such as supplier details from central files.
The system has brought significant staff savings and enabled fewer people to
deal with the same amount of work while providing better service. The paper
chase has been largely eliminated and keyboard data entry and verification
have been vastly reduced.
Cash flow has improved because more suppliers are paid on time. 'We no
longer pay them late - or early,' says Christine Kelly. 'Suppliers would
phone to ask for payment and it was difficult to find the right bits of
paper. We now have easy access to all the documents and can see if payment
is due.'
People's reluctance to check goods and sign goods-received notes was the
biggest problem before but the system has got to grips with this. 'It's
fantastic in this area,' Mrs Kelly says. 'Before, we knew we had queries but
couldn't keep track of them. We now know exactly where queries are and can
gee people up to act on them. We can now be proactive rather than reactive.'
Software details:
Product: Image Systems Europe tailors each document image and work flow
management system to the customer's needs. British Gas uses a version called
ISE Accounts Payable, which can match order documents to invoices and link
to accounts payable systems. A fax facility is available. The system was
launched in 1991. Number of users: six for ISE Accounts Payable: three
British Gas regions, Tesco, Top Rank and Woking Borough Council. The company
has 55 document and work flow management systems installed in the UK and
Europe.
Supplier: Image Systems Europe, formed as a UK company in Sheffield in 1990.
Turnover in 1993-94 was up by 48 per cent at Pounds 2.14m.
Price: Pounds 100,000-Pounds 150,000, including software, scanner and
optical disc system but excluding PCs and networks.
Hardware and operating systems: Novell networks, Unix computers and IBM-type
PCs running OS/2.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (21): A
better way to manage contracts - A simple document image processing system
installed by the pharmaceuticals company Medeva looks set for wider use
following quick installation and enthusiastic reports from staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Medeva, the UK pharmaceutical manufacturer, has installed Archis software
from Belgian company Softcore to manage images of contracts, typically with
other manufacturers, licensees and distributors.
Medeva has installed a network of five Apple Macintosh computers at its
offices in Leatherhead, Surrey, partly to run Archis and partly to support
office automation such as word processing, spreadsheet processing and links
to the company's electronic mail system.
The entire stock of 930 agreements, running to 18,000 pages, has been
entered and all new agreements are scanned in immediately.
The paper contracts have always been kept in fire-proof cabinets and a list
was maintained through a simple database system based on the Dbase III
product.
People working on particular agreements would consult the holder of the
list, intellectual property co-ordinator Gail Beale, to see if there were
any other relevant documents, and then hunt them out in the filing cabinets.
All the documents are now on-line to all staff in the department.
'It could take hours to get through these steps and find files, especially
if you wanted, say, all the agreements relating to a particular company,'
says Mr Peter Cozens, head of licensing and product acquisition.
'The files were just stored in chronological order. We can now search on
many criteria, such as company name and therapeutic area, so we can easily
find the history of agreements in a particular field.
'The system has improved the information we have available and our ability
to respond to different situations.'
It took Gail Beale three months to scan-in all the documents and assign
keywords to each one. She and Peter Cozens agree that the system is very
easy to use. A 'find' screen is presented when a user logs-in and a search
is generated by entering the keywords.
Access is being extended to the company secretary's office in London and the
system has attracted the interest of other departments.
'We could turn out to be a pilot for the whole company in document image
processing,' says Gail Beale. 'It's a very impressive system and I could see
other parts of the company getting considerable benefits.'
Software details:
Archis, a document file management package combining document images, video
and data and text files from other systems. The latest version, 2.0, was
launched in September 1993. Price: Pounds 995.
Supplier: Softcore, the Belgian developer, formed in 1988. The UK subsidiary
was formed in Uxbridge, Middlesex, in 1992. It has 47 staff, including five
in the UK. Turnover in 1993 was Pounds 1.5m. Number of users: more than 200,
including more than 50 in the UK.
Hardware and operating systems: Apple Macintosh central processor; Macintosh
workstations or IBM-type PCs running Windows.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (19): An
expensive option for the foreseeable future - Systems integration / The
perceived demand for systems integration has attracted a growing number of
supplier and services companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Like many computer terms, systems integration is hard to define. At one
level, any computer-based information system must be integrated or it will
not work. But the term has come to refer to a particular class of computer
system - that is, one which is assembled from a set of components in a way
which hides the technology from the customer.
The importance of systems integration as a discipline has grown steadily
since companies began the move towards open systems. A system does not, of
course, need to be 'open' to require integration - but this is where the
largest demand is.
Proprietary systems are also 'integrated' - but most of the integration is
performed by the manufacturer and the system is sold as a complete solution.
Open systems bring the advantages of user choice and flexibility - but there
is a price to pay. They are constructed from hardware and software
'components' which are usually sourced from several different manufacturers.
They will almost certainly involve the use of a technological design
framework which separates systems functions into users and services. This
approach is usually referred to nowadays as client-server computing.
Advanced skills are a pre-requisite to bring these components together to
create coherent and useful applications. Systems integrators must have a
wide knowledge of 'componentry' and how it may be brought together
successfully.
They must also have strong software development skills because integrated
systems invariably require some 'custom-built' components to meet the
application need.
The perceived demand for systems integration has attracted a growing number
of supplier and services companies in the past two or three years.
Established hardware manufacturers in particular have seen systems
integration as a growth area as margins on hardware have fallen. IBM, DEC,
Groupe Bull, ICL and Unisys have emphasised their systems integration
talents in recent years and their service revenues have grown accordingly.
They are not the only contenders. Large consultancy companies such as EDS,
Andersen Consulting and KPMG have also made a large dent in the market as
indeed have traditional custom software developers such as Logica, SEMA and
CGS.
Successful systems integration depends on a broad foundation of standards
for both hardware connections and software compatibility.
Some standards are drawn from formal efforts by international standards
bodies such as the International Standards Organisation (ISO) and the
American National Standards Institute (ANSI).
But many of the standards which make integrated systems possible have
evolved from proprietary industry standards such as IBM's SQL database
standard, which is used to link desktop data tools to database servers.
Given the importance of open systems standards, it is no surprise that the
lead in systems integration has come from the public sector.
The procurement policies of government departments have pushed the cause of
open systems and put many of them in the front line.
'The UK government's decision to force open systems by legislation has been
good for the systems integration market,' says Mr Philip Crawford, UK
managing director of Groupe Bull.
He goes on to say that there are other reasons why the demand for systems
integration has grown faster in the government sector than in the commercial
sector:
'For the last two years companies have been holding off making large
investment decisions because of the recession - and obviously the recession
hits commercial world much more than it hits the government sector.'
Mr Crawford adds that this has depressed the market - but that there are
signs that this is starting to change:
'The market has probably grown at around 15 per cent - when two years ago we
expected it to be more like 40 per cent. But it is now being driven by the
user. The demand for systems integration is coming from the user because
they are crying out for usable power.'
This demand is manifested in the demand to integrate desktop PCs into
existing systems. The PC is obviously the best way to deliver usable power
to the desktop.
Mr Crawford warns, however, that there are dangers:
'The PC is two different tools. If you think of it like a car - it is
excellent for driving around town but it is also pretty good on the
motorway. Good systems integration makes sure that the corporate strategy -
the motorway - does not overwhelm the desktop,' he explains.
Groupe Bull's systems integration strategy, like many others, is based on
developing the right combination of technical skills and relating these to
business problems.
It also sees the wisdom of securing alliances with other important players
in the market and recently signed an agreement with software developer
Microsoft to integrate PC software with its own larger systems.
'This is more than a marketing agreement. We have had to work hard to prove
to Microsoft that we have the integration skills and the support services to
do the job,' says Mr Crawford.
The deal will give Groupe Bull advanced access to important Microsoft
developments such as the Windows NT operating system, which looks set to be
a leading component in future client-server systems.
This level of software is increasingly important to the success of systems
integration as indeed is the move to object-oriented computing, which will
help to enforce standards for software components.
Despite this, systems integration will never be easy - especially as the
number of choices open to users increases.
'Users have developed an attitude which means that they expect information
technology to support them - whereas a few years ago they had to put up with
what they were given. But because of openness, there are far more decisions
to make now and it is certainly is not getting any the less complex,'
observes Mr Crawford.
Systems integrators are, therefore, in the unenviable position of having to
keep up with every new technology development at the same time as meeting
the growing demands of increasingly educated users.
For this reason, systems integration is likely to remain an expensive option
for the foreseeable future.

History often repeats itself - The UK's computing industry / The development
of the UK's computer manufacturing industry ran into problems from the
start.  Genius was let down by poor marketing and lack of government funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Fujitsu's takeover of ICL in 1990 brought an end to a UK-owned computer
manufacturing industry which dated back almost 40 years.
Yet according to some of its early leaders, who met at London's Science
Museum at the end of last month to discuss why the early UK promise was not
fulfilled, the fact that the industry had survived even beyond the 1960s was
quite remarkable.
The packed meeting, organised by the Computer Conservation Society,
highlighted the UK's disadvantages from the very early days.
'The UK's contribution was out of all proportion to its population and
industrial capacity,' said Mr George Davis, who worked at the National
Physical Laboratory on the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine).
'This was true at all stages: the creation of basic concepts, the research
and development leading to the first computers and the emergence of a
computer industry with competing suppliers.'
But Mr Davis argued that the breadth of this contribution meant that the UK
industry was too diverse from the start.
By the mid-1950s there were eight computer manufacturers. They included
Ferranti, English Electric, ICT (International Computers and Tabulators),
Elliott Brothers and Leo Computers - this last was the product of J. Lyons'
extraordinary expansion from tea shops into building computers.
Lyons is credited with being the first organisation to run commercial
applications. Notable among these were bakery production monitoring in 1951
and payroll in 1954. These landmarks inspired The Economist to publish a
feature article in 1954 which asked: 'Is this the first step in an
accounting revolution or merely an interesting and expensive experiment?'
The trouble was that the US, with a similar number of manufacturers, had a
far bigger home market on which to build the foundations for its industry -
and more government support.
'While the US government was supporting research and development in the late
1940s and early 1950s, with guaranteed orders at the end, the computer
industry was not seen as significant in the UK and was not supported,'
George Davis told the Computer Conservation Society.
This was underlined by the practical experiences of Mr Cecil Marks, who
recalled being seconded by Royal Ordnance, where he worked on administration
and accounting, using punched card equipment, to a study carried out by
government departments into the potential uses of computers. Scientists and
users from several departments, including the Treasury, worked for 18
months, culminating in the production of a hefty report and a meeting with
'a very senior civil servant.'
'At the end of the meeting he suggested that this was not the time to be
getting into computers,' Mr Marks said. 'That led to the ordnance factories,
at least, losing ground for more than 10 years.'
Other factors were brought to light by Mr Hugh Ross, who set up Ferranti's
London computer centre in the mid-1950s. He pointed to a dispute between
Ferranti and the National Research Development Corporation, over
manufacturing costs underwritten by the publicly-funded corporation, which
led to a nine-month ban on sales. As Mr Ross said, this had a 'crippling'
impact on UK success in the emerging market, as well as hitting Ferranti's
cash flow.
But Mr Ross also blamed an absence of financial management for Ferranti's
failure to fulfil its early promise. Even when he set up the London computer
centre, he said, he never had to account for any money he spent - indeed, he
had never had a budget in the first place.
Later, when he was responsible for Ferranti's pioneering documentation
service, one of the biggest spending units, Mr Ross again had no budget.
Moreover, he had never had to produce a business plan and was never called
to account. 'There was no financial management at all,' he said.
'I later joined STC and came in contact with management training provided by
its owner, the US ITT group,' Mr Ross added. 'This was terrific - and a
profound shock, after Ferranti. We had to produce business plans, prepare
budgets and report our monthly results against those budgets.'
Such personal reminiscences add flesh to historians' reports on UK genius
being let down by everything from poor marketing to lack of government
funding, compared with the US, France and Germany.
Whatever the combination of factors, George Davis showed how US
manufacturers took firm control within a dozen years of J. Lyons running
that first payroll system.
By 1967, IBM had installed over 21,500 computers of various sizes; UK market
leader ICT (soon to become ICL) had sold 844. These included 399 of the new
1900 range (which was to be the company's mainstay until the middle of the
1970s); meanwhile, IBM's System 360, launched the same year, was already up
to 5,730 installations.
In 1968, ICL was formed as the great white hope: the culmination of merging
the computing activities of all the early manufacturers. Yet it was still
dwarfed by IBM: George Davis showed that in 1969 ICL had a Pounds 115m
turnover and spent Pounds 13m on research and development, while IBM had a
turnover of Pounds 3,000m and a research budget of almost Pounds 170m.
However, a retired ICL executive director, Mr Peter Hall, stoutly defended
ICL's record. ICL and its ICT forerunner had been profitable for 35 years -
apart from in 1965, just after taking over Ferranti's ailing computing
operation; and in 1981, when the visionary Dr Robb Wilmot was transforming
the company for the emerging office computing revolution.
Mr Hall said Fujitsu allowed ICL to run itself, and that the company
generated all its own cash for takeovers and other investment, and did all
its own design work.
Whether that makes ICL any more British than IBM UK (or Rover Group in the
car industry, for that matter) is debatable. But Mr Hall argued that these
points suggest that the early promise of the UK computer manufacturing
industry, which had mostly merged into ICL by 1969, was fulfilled after all.
It is simply that a generation later the industry is all in foreign hands.
As today's tight margins on hardware increasingly cause computer
manufacturers to look to software and services for their profits, it is
equally debatable whether the virtual disappearance of a UK computer
manufacturing industry need be a cause for concern.
That concern is now focused more on the software industry, where some big
names have fallen into foreign ownership. Takeovers of Cap, Hoskyns, Istel,
Scicon and others have given substantial footholds in the UK market to, for
example, the telecoms giant AT&amp;T, General Motors' EDS subsidiary and the
French company CGS, Europe's biggest computing services group.
History, as they say, has a habit of repeating itself.
The Computer Conservation Society has regular meetings and works on
restoring ancient computers. It is also opening Bletchley Park (which
cracked German codes in the Second World War) for public visits. The
secretary is Tony Sale, (0234) 822788.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (16): A
radical change in culture - Case study, two companies break new ground
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Facilities management agreement between BP Exploration Europe (BPXEU) in
Aberdeen, and Andersen Consulting, broke new ground for both companies. In
effect, BPXEU outsourced not only the IT department and the accounting
software it had used, but the actual accounting function and staff as well.
The decision, taken in the early 1990s, affected the entire accounting
services of the UK and the Continental Shelf operations - a Pounds 12bn
business worldwide, employing some 7,000 people. Another unusual aspect was
the extreme secrecy of the arrangements: the 300 accounting staff affected
were not told until after months of negotiations and hammering out details
of the facilities management (FM) contract.
The driving force for BP Exploration towards facilities management was the
need to cut down all expenses by 30 per cent. Tom Wright, control and
planning manager at BPXEU , explains the pressures brought about by the
collapse of oil prices since the early 1980s - 'we realised we would have to
radically alter the way we did business to remain competitive. We had to
reduce costs 30 per cent across the board,' he says. 'It was a requirement
for every manager to achieve that within three years without compromising
health and safety.'
The core skill for BPXEU was its business of oil exploration, and a hard
look at the accounting services revealed that a line could be drawn between
what accounting information was truly necessary in-house, and what was not.
'It is vital that we have that information, for making policy and
interpreting business information, but not that we provide it ourselves,'
says Mr Wright.
'Similar styles' is the reason he gives for the choice of Andersen
Consulting, which already had a track record at BPXEU. When news of the
announcement broke in June, it was a brand new idea for both companies.
Andersen was to take over accounting staff as well as IT staff and computer
assets.
'Initially there was shock, even anger. However we had prepared pre-planned,
individual, intensive counselling sessions, and by the end of the day,
people understood the effect it was going to have. We though that was better
than months of uncertainty,' says Wright.
The business was transferred under transfer of undertaking legislation,
which protects the employees and their rights. Effectively they had no
choice, although for some, the centralisation of operations in Aberdeen,
from the six sites previously involved, pre-determined the decision.
'Everyone outside Aberdeen had a choice of relocation to new location or
accepting severance terms,' says Tom Wright. 'They were transferred - full
stop. There was no choice.'
Andersen took over the staff, the Vax computer and McCormack and Dodge (now
Dun &amp; Bradstreet) Millennium software used for the accounts. Wright himself
has no doubts that the deal arranged for BPXEU accounting staff actually
secured better career prospects and long-term employment.
'Andersen Consulting provides greater focus and incentive for the staff who
feel far closer to the business. If an accountant works for an accountancy
company, it is the focus of using the core skills in the core business that
drives the difference. No one believes that on 'day one,' of course, but
after six or seven months that is exactly what has happened.'
The pension rights were the only thing that had to be addressed - in some
cases 'topped up' to match the BP scheme for those transferring to the
Andersen pension scheme.
'The key benefits are the enthusiasm and the focus of the staff. It has
reduced costs by creating a single interface, instead of a myriad of
interfaces,' says Mr Wright. 'The real effect is that we have turned a fixed
cost to a variable, or at least semi-variable cost. As the service expands -
say, drilling increases or new fields come online, or we dispose of other
assets - so the cost varies. Now we can concentrate on the core business,
and it allows us to focus on the business of exploration and production. It
has simplified things. We don't have to worry about training, developing and
motivating 300 accounting and support staff.'
However, there has been no abdication of decision-making. 'We take all the
business decisions. They provide the financial analysis and variants
analysis, but they don't decide what should be done: the decision-making is
the core skill.' says Mr Wright. He believes the physical distance of the
Andersen operation, five miles away, was essential to bring about a change
of culture.
The initial contract is for four years: both parties reckon on three years
to get the costs down, although a longer partnership is envisaged.
'It's an opportunity to share benefits: if Andersen can grow the business,
they can bring the cost down. They have the focus to do it faster and more
efficiently. The other thing I'd emphasise is that we really did want the
best for our staff. We honestly believed they would have a better future
than in a business where the cost pressures of the North Sea were a constant
threat,' he adds.
The FM contract has had one more important psychological effect, he says.
'More than anything else, the move convinced everybody else inside BP that
we are serious about changing the way we do business.'
For Andersen, the business has grown as expected. It took 317 staff from
BPXEU, only 30 of them computer-based. 'That's what makes this deal so
unusual: it's a business function management, not just systems management,'
says Norman Cook, Andersen's associate partner, the head of the unit at
Aberdeen.
It now has extra customers, including Sun Oil in Aberdeen. Cook's view is
that Andersen's expertise has already brought savings. He is confident that
the current costs of Pounds 15m per year can be brought down by Pounds 5m by
1995 - 'we've saved a lot because we manage the bank balance tightly: Pounds
500,000 a year in funding charges alone.'
Bill Lattimer, partner in charge of market development for the outsourcing
practice at Andersen Consulting, believes this is the way FM is going - 'the
IT component is of less interest to the customer: it's not the important
element in Aberdeen. The way we have developed the people is important. We
have taken an organisation, a process, and completely redefined the way the
service operates and the way it interacts with its customers. The
value-added service we're providing is our skills in service definition and
management.'

Customer-driven approach - Facilities management, the supplier's viewpoint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Starting a facilities management company might seem a radical departure for
Bull Information Systems, but when Athesa, its new facilities management
(FM) division, was launched in February, Philip Crawford, the chief
executive, insisted that the new company was no departure but a logical
evolution from the role that Bull has long held with its customers, writes
Claire Gooding.
Mr Crawford sees FM as an international opportunity - 'the use of partners
to offer a full range of services in the outsourcing arena will be a growing
trend. We can draw on facilities in 28 countries,' he says.
The company is experienced in changing its role as the computer industry has
evolved. Its primary markets - healthcare, police and local government - are
among those most drastically affected by the demands of cost- cutting and
compulsory competitive tendering.
According to Athesa director, Brian Gunn, the move is customer-driven - 'we
are focusing to deliver a range of services, from under one roof. In the
last 12 months customers, especially in local government, have been asking
us what we are doing in FM.'
Bull has used partnerships of various sorts as the platform for its own
sundry changes of direction. As part of its adjustment to Open Systems, it
has developed strong links with software vendors and value-added resellers.
In the past Bull has done well as the prime bidder in single-source
contracts, with clients who are comfortable with the 'one bottom to kick'
principle.
The key to success, he believes, is flexibility in the use of staff. There
is a core of 60 Athesa staff in the division, but he intends to treat the
rest of Bull as on call. At one client, Glaxo, Athesa is providing a desktop
service where it is installing, maintaining and supporting PCs, LANs, and
Unix servers, not only in the UK, but in 26 countries worldwide. The
contract has been worth Pounds 2.4m since it began in 1992, and is expected
to be renewed at the end of its current period in 1994.
'We can bring our skills to the fore in forging new partnerships. There is a
range of skills and complementary expertise we can draw on. Perhaps those
skills are not unique in themselves, but what is unusual is that we can pull
it all together,' says Gunn.
Development and systems integration are complementary to Athesa's plans.
Bull's Systems Integration section will provide the experts who are needed
on projects needed, for any period from a week to two or three years. Athesa
will provide the long-term support for operations and applications support,
and management of IT. Bull's plans are standard in this area, involving the
takeover of staff and assets. 'We have the resources on tap, they get the
career opportunities,' says Mr Gunn.
Athesa's sister company, the People Plus head-hunters, are part of the
partnership. In one sense, Gunn argues, the source of supply is the
cornerstone of the business. There has always been a division in programming
between those who develop and those who maintain software.
While this distinction has been largely broken down by the increased use of
software packages, and the availability of fourth generation languages,
there will be times when the aristocrats of development will be needed on a
short-term basis.
In concentrating on the desktop delivery, Bull is not alone. Desktop and the
network have become more important, Supporting legacy systems is bread and
butter, but the market is heading towards improving, not merely maintaining
operations.
'It is in the area of business operations that the opportunities of
cost-benefits are to be achieved', comments Mr Gunn.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (15): A
make-or-break factor - Facilities management / In the term 'computer
services,' emphasis is shifting away from computers and towards services.
That is one reason why companies once dedicated to hardware or software are
moving into facilities management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The ability of a company to operate - or not - may depend on the management
of its computer system. This can be the 'make-or-break' factor, especially
as computers move close to the centre of business in areas such as
manufacturing, customer service and sales, as well as the traditional
accounting functions.
On this premise both factions on facilities management (FM) base their
arguments. The faction 'against' believes the computer system is so vital to
the competitive strength of core activities that it would be madness to
contract it out. Inside knowledge - expertise about computing, and the
business - should stay that way.
The argument about being in the centre of things hands equal ammunition to
those who promote FM. In a culture where compulsory competitive tendering
(CCT) is the norm, there are economies of scale in an outside (or
'outsourced') supplier providing the hardware, the software, and the
expertise to support it.
CCT demands that every contract decision must involve those classic
elements, 'measure and deliver' - dear to the heart of IT professionals. You
can't deliver what you can't measure. Furthermore, FM proponents argue that
they are much better at knowing how much things should cost, where economies
can be made, and delivering them, undistracted by the fluctuating concerns
of core operations.
Coding, programming and the support of end users are the central activities
of an IT department. The argument runs thus: how much better for individuals
to be at the profit making centre of a company whose business is supplying
IT services, than to be at the periphery of a company whose real raison
d'etre is baking biscuits, making cars, or exploring for oil.
It has to be said, on both sides, that the margins in supplying computer
hardware and even packaged software have dwindled. However, the
long-accepted figure of '80 per cent of IT spending is on support and
maintenance' stays constant. The tedium of arguing about who owns a problem
(software, hardware, network?) has driven many a user-company into
single-source-supplier agreements, and the idea of contracting out an entire
IT department is simply a logical step further in cost control.
The result is a burgeoning market in 'systems integration' and 'facilities
management' - new names for bundling activities, familiar since the earliest
days of computer services.
Systems integration is a broad church. It covers anything to do with
development - including every sort of alliance of software and hardware
involved in setting up new systems. FM is the contracting out of an entire
task and its maintenance - the contractors take over the assets and the
manpower necessary to the service.
The research company Dataquest estimates the value of the FM marketplace at
more than Dollars 2,500m in Europe, growing by 20 per cent a year. This
explains why some of the best-known names in the computer industry are now
turning to FM as a core activity.
They include the big, traditional firms of accountants such as Andersen
Consulting and Ernst and Young, and names once identified with
manufacturing, rather than merely supporting computers. Unisys and Olivetti,
for example, are among the companies which, once known for their proprietary
hardware, have turned to supplying services and support for almost any sort
of hardware and software, particularly the workstations and PCs termed
'desktop services'.
Nearly 1,000 of Olivetti UK's 1,400 employees are in the Customer Support
Group, working for a customer base largely in the financial and retail
sector. Unisys has recently signed up Bass Taverns, the UK's largest public
house retailer, for an FM contract worth over Pounds 3.9m over three years.
Its job is to support 2,500 pubs, developing and supporting Bass's Central
Retail System.
In the UK, other users of Unisys' outsourcing services include McDonald's
Restaurants. US users include the federal government, the Ford Motor
Company, and Nasa.
Hoskyns is an active FM company, one of the UK's largest computer services
companies, worth Pounds 200m, part of the French-owned Cap Gemeni Sogeti
Group. UK customers include Woolworths, Bristol Water, and Hoover -
'outsourcing is still the fastest-growing sector of the IT services market.
Analysts estimate that the European market will double by 1998 to a value of
Pounds 4bn,' says Peter Falconer, Hoskyns' associate director.
Falconer is looking to the European market to expand. Five recent contracts
for Hoskyns' Scandinavian sister company, adding up to Pounds 17m worth in
all, underline the ambition. 'The pace at which FM is adopted will differ
country by country,' he says. 'CGS is well placed to benefit from this
expansion, because it is committed to regional as well as global service
delivery.'
He argues that in-house IT departments find it difficult to keep pace with
the growing demands of the organisations they serve, and the increasing
complexity of PCs and LANs is putting more strain on them.
According to a 1993 survey by Romtec, desktop services (PCs, their
procurement, installation, configuration and support) is the fastest-growing
part of FM - worth over Pounds 1bn by 1995. Asset management, network
design, installation and administration, and the end-user helpdesk, all come
under the 'desktop' label. The desktop is one of the prime areas targeted by
Bull Information Systems, the newest arrival in the FM market, which
launched its Athesa FM division this February (see below).
Sharing the benefits of cost-saving is a convincing argument for FM, but
there is always concern about staff who have to change allegiance to the
'outsourced' supplier. (See panel on Andersen's BP contract for an example).
There are regulations to protect them: the Transfer of Undertakings
Protection of Employment Regulations 1981 retains current terms and
conditions for staff being transferred.
The government is anxious to remove obstacles to free market testing.
According to the William Waldegrave, the minister for public service and
science, speaking at a recent Financial Times conference on resource
management, 'The relevant provisions of the Deregulation and Contracting-Out
Bill, now before Parliament, are designed to extend the scope for market
testing activities in central and local government by removing obstacles to
the contracting-out of statutory functions.' This is good news for Athesa
and others - but staff affected might not be so pleased.
Unison, the UK's biggest trade union, and CMS, a division of British Steel,
claimed to have broken new ground when they recently signed a trade union
agreement which outlined practices and procedures to be followed when staff
transferred from Cambridge City Council to CMS, a division of British Steel,
which won the multi-million pound contract in late 1993. According to Mark
Pope, CMS sales and marketing manager, this was an important 'industry
first'.
'We believe it is important that our new staff have confidence in us, and we
in them.' The Unison office at Cambridge City Council stressed the
importance of contractors recognising unions. 'If we are to be subject to
the contracting out of services from local authorities, then it is important
that any successful contractor recognises unions: CMS was the only candidate
that had any track record of successful relationships with Unions.'
This is a hint that the change of culture associated with working for one
organisation rather than another might bring new patterns to the computer
industry. 'Partnership' - the key word emphasised by all FM suppliers -
means both partners making allowances if the marriage is to last.

Watchword for the future - Global mobile communications / Paul Quigley
charts the rapid progress towards a mobile millenium in communications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL QUIGLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Mind the gap]' warns a familiar, faceless voice to travellers on the London
Underground. This could well be the watchword for the future of global
mobile communications as a radical revolution takes place.
The 'gap' in this case is 'globalisation and personalisation' - the main
themes of the wireless age.
Few of us could have predicted the all-pervasive influence which personal
computers would come to have in business and personal life over the last
decade. Yet we are seeing the integration of voice, data, image, and
communications in a natural evolution towards the multimedia workstation.
Similarly, emerging technologies in mobile communications have catapulted
wireless, mobile and personal communications into one of the fastest growing
markets in the world. The range of technologies becoming available is
immense. Many people know about and use cellular telephones and radiopagers.
Others are aware of mobile data and digital cordless technologies. Plans are
well under way for future wireless and mobile communications systems which
will obfuscate the demarcation lines between wireless and fixed
telecommunications.
First generation cellular technologies - those in use today - are
predominantly analogue systems such as AMPS (American Mobile Phone System),
TACS (Total Access Communication System) and NMT (Nordic Mobile Telephone)
systems.
Radiopaging has been dominated by the POCSAG (Post Office Code Standards
Advisory Group) system. Second generation mobile technologies are now
becoming commercially available, introducing digital architectures to mobile
communications. These include GSM, CT2, DECT, CDMA and the lesser-known
IS-54 and PDC.
The speed of developments in the mobile industry accelerates apace. For
example, it took cellular phone manufacturers eight hours to make a cellular
phone in 1988; 30 minutes in 1992. Today it takes a mere 12 minutes - and
this is a telephone containing computer capacity of between 30m and 40m
instructions per second, equivalent to the power of mainframes of only a few
years ago.
GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) is in the limelight around the
world. Developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute
(ETSI), the technical standards body, GSM is the first harmonised European
standard to catch the imagination and the investment of users, operators,
and manufacturers alike.
GSM was developed as a pan-European digital cellular radio network
architecture; it has evolved over more than 10 years into the standard we
see today. Set to grow at an unprecedented rate over the next five years,
GSM is already far more than merely a European standard. Already it has been
adopted as the preferred choice of international mobile network operators in
countries as diverse as Australia, New Zealand, Russia, South Africa, Hong
Kong, China, India, Pakistan, and the Gulf states.
A report entitled 'GSM - Going Global', by consultancy Nexus Market
Analysis, forecasts that there will be 40m GSM users by the year 2002 in
Europe alone. Driven by falling handset prices, competitive tariffs and
wider network coverage, the market is growing at a phenomenal rate. The
international roaming capability of GSM, coupled with the phase two
supplementary service enhancements such as data communications and fax, is
making GSM a serious contender as the benchmark for future global mobile
systems.
DCS1800, a digital cellular standard based on the GSM specification for
lower power handsets, points to the future in the wireless market. Operating
in the 1.8 GHz band width, DCS1800 is intended for use as a mass market
personal communications network, or PCN.
With a design philosophy quite distinct from its forbears, the key to the
PCN market will be simplicity and ease of use. The target market for the
'personal communicator' is you and me.
In the UK there are two licensed PCN operators. Germany has licensed one
DCS1800 operator; so has Thailand. France is in the process of licensing a
DCS1800 operator and others are sure to follow. There is growing speculation
that US telecom regulators will grant Personal Communications Services (PCS)
licences to operators touting DCS at 1900 MHz.
Cordless technologies such as CT2 (second generation digital cordless
telephony) and DECT (Digital European Cordless Telecoms) are also reviving
the industry. CT2 has recently experienced mixed fortunes around the world.
The failure of CT2 as a public telepoint technology in the UK made many
people think it was a dead-duck digital technology. However, mass uptake of
CT2 in Hong Kong, France and elsewhere has forced a re-evaluation of its
future. (The advent of the DECT standard may have somewhat dampened this, as
DECT has found converts in the cordless PABX arena, the wireless local area
network (WLAN) market and even in the wireless local loop market.)
In radiopaging, developments in memory capacity, functionality and coverage
are vying to re-establish this elder statesman of mobile communications as a
flexible and feature-rich medium.
'Wireless Messaging' is the term used by many people in the industry for
radiopaging. ERMES (European Radio Messaging), the ETSI standard for digital
paging, is taking longer than expected to launch. Third generation systems
are already on the drawing board, with concepts such as 'Future Public Land
Mobile Telecommunications System' (FPLMTS), 'Universal Mobile
Telecommunications System' (UMTS) and 'Universal Personal
Telecommunications' (UPT) already well under development.
The backbone of these third generation systems will be Intelligent Networks
(Ins) which will enable users to rely on the intelligence in the digital
network to handle the mechanics and logistics of routeing, storing and
forwarding of data.
Competition in Europe and across the world has driven the market -
competition not only in handsets and equipment manufacture, but especially
between network operators. At a recent IBC conference on Pan-European
Digital Cellular Radio in Athens, GSM was seen as the de facto global
standard.
Yet, despite GSM's runaway international success, there is a continuing
debate within the industry over the future air interface of digital cellular
systems. GSM, DCS1800, DECT, and others use TDMA (Time Division Multiple
Access), which breaks up speech channels into multiple time slots. Over the
last few years the industry has been rocked by an alternative digital air
interface: CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access), a spread-spectrum
technology making better use of available frequencies.
As we hurtle headlong towards a new mobile millennium, a blurring of the
edges in place-to-place and person-to-person communications will give rise
to wholesale change. We're going global in a wireless world. Mind the gap]
Stand clear of the doors, please]

FT  16 MAR 94 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (13): A
tricky balancing act for leading vendors - Telecom equipment suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NEWMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is substantial uncertainty in the international market for public
telecommunications 'which is characterised by lower investment and
intensifying price competition particularly in the major industrialised
countries' - this was the gloomy prognosis for telecom equipment suppliers,
given by the Swedish manufacturer Ericsson, during its 1993 results meeting.
Five years ago this kind of outlook would have been deeply damaging for a
company like Ericsson. In common with its rivals in Europe - Alcatel and
Siemens - Ericsson placed a heavy reliance on the sale of switching
equipment to state-owned telephone companies in western Europe.
But Ericsson's focus has changed over the last two to three years. Mobile
communications is now its core business. And while Europe remains an
important market for sales of switching equipment, Ericsson is increasingly
tapping emerging markets such as India and China for new sales.
The telecom equipment market today is undergoing rapid change both in terms
of the products that are manufactured and the markets where they are sold.
Big business users are demanding high-speed broadband services to send
massive volumes of data backwards and forwards between their offices
scattered across the world. Radio is becoming the cheaper than copper for
access to long-distance networks. And the term 'multimedia' is causing panic
among equipment vendors. They will undoubtedly play a role in building
multimedia networks.
But software is the key to multimedia and if equipment vendors fail to reach
alliances with software companies, they may be left behind. The leading
equipment suppliers such as Alcatel, Siemens, American Telephone and
Telegraph and Northern Telecom are still making public switches.
But most state-owned telephone companies in western Europe and North America
are now reducing their investment levels. They have digitalised their
long-distance networks and modernisation of local networks for low-spending
residential customers is proceeding at a slower rate. Recession - first in
North America and now in Europe - has also taken its toll.
Increasingly, switch suppliers are targetting the emerging Asian markets.
China is the biggest prize and its requirements are so immense that there is
room for all suppliers. Ian Macleod, a telecommunications analyst at Natwest
Sellier in Paris, calculates that in 1992, total line deliveries (switch
orders are expressed in terms of the number of lines that can be connected)
to China came to around four million.
He estimates that the figure doubled to eight million in 1993, and that by
1996, orders could be running at 12m lines a year. To raise telephone
penetration to its planned level of 10 per cent by the end of the decade,
China will have to buy 100m lines between 1992 and 2000.
India's expansion programme will require the installation of 18m lines over
the same period. Major suppliers to Asia such as Alcatel and Ericsson are
gradually moving manufacturing facilities into local markets. There are
clear benefits to be had.
Production costs are lower than in Europe or North America. But this is not
the prime motivating factor. In many cases, governments insist on local
manufacture to provide jobs and prepare the way for indigenous production.
Some governments in eastern Europe make the acquisition of local production
facilities a pre-condition of contract awards. Otherwise, the local
manufacturers which supplied the national telephone companies during the
Cold War would inevitably face closure.
But it would be a mistake to imagine that western manufacturers are packing
their bags and heading east. Sales into developing markets are more of an
expansion than a re-orientation.
The riches are still in Western Europe and North America, although the
importance of public switching equipment is inevitably in decline. Alcatel,
the world's largest telecom equipment manufacturer, still relies on Europe
for 75 per cent of its sales.
Driven by a wave of liberalisation, the European telecommunications
equipment market will undergo radical change over coming years. The cosy
relationship between state-owned telephone companies and local manufacturers
will be forced apart as new operators attack the lucrative international and
business communications markets.
Closed markets will open as state-owned telephone companies begin to behave
like proper commercially-run companies. And national champions such as
Siemens and Alcatel will respond by selling their products to competitors to
Deutsche Telekom and France Telekom.
The UK telecommunications market is already the most liberalised in the
world.
Equipment manufacturers are widening their vision beyond BT and Mercury
Communications, and are facing immense pressure from both the new operators
and the incumbents to develop new technology that gives them a competitive
edge.
New international and long-distance telephone networks are being built,
wireless technology is being trialled for local telephone networks, and
cable television operators are being allowed to offer telephone services.
The requirements of big business users are setting the agenda for equipment
vendors. Coping with massive flows of data between sites has become a
headache for today's telecommunications manager.
A surge in demand for the interconnection of local computer-based networks
has led to the development of a fast packet-switching service for data
communications called frame relay.
Equipment vendors are facing stiff competition in frame relay from smaller
companies in the computer and networking sectors such as Cisco Systems,
Raycom Systems and StrataCom.
A bigger battle is being fought for dominance in Asynchronous Transfer Mode
(ATM), a technique for sharing the capacity of a telecoms channel between
those wishing to use it. ATM enables telephone operators to offer high
bandwidth services, such as high-speed data or video-conferencing, with
improved efficiency and greater flexibility.
ATM is already being touted as the backbone for multimedia and other
broadband services, and can be applied to both private and public networks.
All leading equipment vendors are positioning themselves for a share of the
ATM market. A group of 16 European operators in 15 countries is to conduct
an ATM trial this year, and all have awarded ATM contracts.
Familiar names such as Alcatel, Siemens, American Telephone and Telegraph
and Ericsson have won contracts along with Netcomm, a UK-based data switch
manufacturer.
Ericsson has prospered as a leading telecommunications equipment
manufacturer in a market which is undergoing rapid technological and where a
number of its rivals are stumbling. Alcatel, Siemens and Northern Telecom
all suffered profit setbacks in 1993.
They were hit by a fall in orders for public telecommunications equipment as
a result of the recession in North America and Europe. Meanwhile, products
based on ATM, and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy, its sister transmission
technology, are only now emerging from the laboratory and operators are
reluctant to commit themselves to major orders.
Lars Ramqvist, Ericsson's managing director, puts his company's strong
financial performance in 1993 down to a strategy which meant spending 15
times more on R&amp;D than on dividends.
In a speech at the 1994 Innovation Lecture in London last month, Ramqvist
said manufacturers needed to forego short-term profit in favour of higher
R&amp;D spending.
Ian Macleod at Natwest Sellier is confident that the combination of
liberalisation and new technologies 'promises a new phase of growth in the
world telecommunications equipment market.'
Leading equipment vendors are best-placed to benefit from the growth. But
they will have to get the balance right between selling old products into
new markets, and bringing out new products for their older customers in
Europe and North America.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (12): A
global scramble for partners - The big telecom operators / The emergence of
global service providers able to meet the needs of multinational
corporations is being slowed by a range of cultural and technical problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Telecommunications giants are stumbling towards global alliances which will
bring down national barriers and sideline second-division telephone
companies.
The telecommunications big boys say alliances are a response to the
communications needs of multinational corporations, but, at times, it seems
as though the customers are the sideshow, and the main event is a showdown
between telephone operators determined to outmanoeuvre each other.
BT carries much of the responsibility for the high levels of activity among
the world's largest telephone operators over the last three years. It tried
to set up an exclusive partnership with Deutsche Telekom and Nippon
Telephone and Telegraph in 1991. This fell apart after Deutsche Telekom
insisted on including its French allies, NTT got cold feet, and both the
Japanese and the Europeans realised that their competition authorities might
not think a joint venture company intent on exercising global competitive
strength was a good idea.
In fairness to BT, it saw a market emerging for the provision of global
communications services, and this has been the motivation behind its
attempts to put together worldwide alliances. Many other companies, despite
their claims, would be happy to keep the status quo and to exclude BT from
their markets.
Events have moved on since 1991: BT has taken a 20-per-cent stake in MCI,
the second largest US long-distance telephone company, and the two companies
are setting up a new company dedicated exclusively to selling services to
multinational corporations; France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom have set up
a joint venture company of their own; three second-tier European telephone
operators, PTT Telecom Netherlands, Telia of Sweden, and Switzerland's PTT
Telecom have set up a venture called Unisource; and American Telephone and
Telegraph has also announced a world strategy of its own.
Brokers in the global power game will emerge from these four groupings, but
the next few years will see a jockeying for position among the global
communications protagonists and the expansion of existing partnerships.
Other telecommunications companies waiting on the sidelines are US
long-distance operator, Sprint, Japanese operators, KDI and NTT, Cable &amp;
Wireless, Spain's Telefonica and Telecom Italia, the group that will emerge
from the restructuring of Italy's telecommunications services sector, but
they will face a number of obstacles along the way which will slow the
progress of global partnerships. The main ones are:
US partners: most multinational corporations are headquartered in the US.
The idea of a global communications company is that it can deliver services
in all of those countries where multinational companies have offices.
A presence in the US, therefore, is vital. Two of the groupings, Unisource
and France Telecom/Deutsche Telekom need US partners. AT&amp;T, MCI and Sprint
are the three obvious candidates for anyone in search of a US partner.
MCI has already thrown in its lot with BT, so this only leaves AT&amp;T and
Sprint. France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom were in serious discussions with
AT&amp;T last year with a view to an alliance that would have involved a pooling
of international telecommunications activities in a new company but Project
Atlantic has broken down following suggestions from the competition
authorities in Brussels that it would fall foul of rules on mergers. A
less-ambitious alliance is now under discussion, but this may not satisfy
the ambitions of AT&amp;T.
Unisource appeared to be lining up Sprint two years ago when the two sides
agreed to interconnect their data communications networks, but the agreement
was terminated at the end of last year after Unisource lost one of its first
customers, Swedish conglomerate, SKF Group, because of problems with the
interconnection of the two networks.
Systems integration: telecommunications networks are constructed in
different ways and by different manufacturers. When SKF Group cancelled its
contract with Unisource, it cited the failure of Unisource and Sprint to
provide seamless network integration.
Systems integration will be one of the main tasks facing BT and MCI when
they construct a global network platform. Customers in the US will connect
on to MCI's network, while BT is installing network facilities in Europe.
Old friends: partnerships already exist between international telephone
operators. When a UK company orders an international private circuit from
BT, for example, from London to Paris, BT has to liaise with France Telecom
for the half-circuit on the French side. Similarly, international telephone
operators have to pay each other for delivering calls to their customers.
Accounts are settled according to the international settlements procedure.
Complications arise when a country has more than one international operator.
For example, the UK has BT and Mercury, while the US has three large
international carriers, AT&amp;T, MCI and Sprint.
In this case, BT would divide its international outgoing traffic between the
US operators according to the market share of the three operators for
international calls from the US.
AT&amp;T has roughly 60 per cent of the US long-distance market, so it receives
60 per cent of all incoming calls. This business is highly lucrative as the
settlements procedure sets prices at above cost. If AT&amp;T was to side against
large international operators, it could threaten existing relationships.
This explains why AT&amp;T says it would prefer to offer global services in
partnership with state-owned telephone companies rather than in competition
with them.
Regulation: few countries allow competition with state-owned telephone
operators in basic voice telephone services. In Europe, restrictions will
not be removed until 1998, although many companies are already exploiting
uncertainties about the rules for competition in services to closed user
groups. Global alliances will also attract scrutiny from both national and
regional governmental bodies.
BT's acquisition of a 20 per cent stake in MCI had to go before the the US
State Department and Department of Justice, as well as the Federal
Communications Commission, the telecommunications regulatory authority. It
also needed clearance from the European Commission.
An alliance between AT&amp;T, France Telecom and Deutshce Telekom would face
even closer scrutiny, and is the main reason for the decision of the three
operators to seek a less-ambitious alliance than was originally envisaged.
Outsourcing: global alliances are founded on the assumption that
multinational corporations will, over the next few years, decide to
outsource their telecommunications networks to third parties. But Mr Lenny
Elefenbein, the managing director of US telecommunications consultancy, Lynx
Technologies, notes that 'while an impressive number of users have put out
requests for information, very few have actually awarded their businesses to
one of the carriers.'
He says that even the large carriers have been confused by the high ratio of
activity to closed deals and that several of them have commissioned internal
studies to determine 'why they they are not getting their share of the
perceived big outsourcing bonanza.'
Cultures: while MCI is an aggressive, marketing-driven company, BT is still
making the transition from a government department nine years after its
privatisation and ten years after the ending of its monopoly. Many observers
question the ability of the two companies to work together effectively.
The problems will be even greater for other transatlantic partnerships.
Other telephone companies in Europe are still under state-control and have
not even begun to make the transition to commercially-run companies that BT
started in the late 1980s.
There will be other problems along the way, many of them arising as global
consortia threaten to take lucrative business contracts from state-owned
telephone operators in smaller countries, leaving them only with the
unprofitable residential customers.
A momentum has built up behind the formation of global alliances which will
assure their emergence, but there will be problems along the way, and big
businesses - in whose interests the alliances are being formed  - will have
to wait a little longer before operators deliver the services that match
their global service claims.

Computer industry in transition - The seismic trauma that has rocked the
computer industry in the early 1990s is not just the result of a recession -
it is the result of a fundamental shift in technology / Philip Manchester
looks at network developments and the business benefits of client-server
systems
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The computer industry fared well in previous recessions because companies
turned to automation to save costs and cut staff. But in the early 1990s it
was different. Former giants of the industry - such as IBM and DEC -
tottered alarmingly and have yet to prove they will survive the upheaval.
The main cause is the transition from centralized, mainframe-based computing
to distributed client-server-based computing.
In many ways the transition reflects a wider change which is taking place in
industry generally; local autonomy from the distribution of computer power
and management responsibility.
Technologically, this change manifests itself in client-server systems - an
approach to distributed computing which separates users (clients) and the
services they use (servers).
Client-server computing has its origins in database management systems
(DBMS) and the trend to separate the software used to access data from the
software used to manage it.
During the 1980s, developers created a new model for DBMS which allowed
these two components to be distributed across computers on a network. The
front-end tools - data query languages and local applications - became known
as 'clients' and the back-end DBMS 'engines' became known as servers.
Database vendors such as Oracle, Ingres, Sybase and Gupta use this approach
in their products with the result that they can all communicate with each
other.
A front-end tool from Gupta, for example, can use a back-end DBMS engine
from Oracle without the user ever being aware of the location of the data.
Client-server computing extends this idea across the whole system and breaks
down functions according to their role either as a client or a server.
addition to DBMS servers, a modern network will have servers to handle
printing, communications, mass storage back up and so on.
This approach can bring many benefits. It allows users greater freedom in
their choice of hardware and software - with consequent cost-savings. It
makes systems more flexible and provides for better integration of different
types of systems.
'We have to tie the benefits to the business and I think client-server does
this in four ways,' says Mr Lawrence Hunt, director of distributed
processing at the UK software company ACT.
'Firstly, client-server is much more flexible than traditional mainframe
systems. If you want to get data for management information systems, this is
difficult with closed mainframes.
'Secondly, it lets you integrate application more easily. You can integrate
a PC-based spreadsheet into a mainframe database much more easily with a
client-server approach.
'Thirdly, client-server systems give much more independence from vendors.
All business want to future-proof their investment in applications software,
which probably represents 80 per cent of the cost of a system. Client-server
enables you to do this effectively.
'Finally, client-server systems can cut costs. We were recently installed a
client-server system at a large investment bank. The costs came to about
Pounds 1.5m. It would have cost Pounds 3m if we'd had to use a traditional
approach with mainframes,' says Mr Hunt.
Other financial institutions have also opted for the client-server approach
in a big way. The Nationwide Building Society, for example, has standardised
on Microsoft's Windows NT operating system as the lynchpin for a
client-server system which will support 10,000 personal computer users over
the next three years. It is also looking into the possibility of plugging
its Automatic Teller Machine network into the new system with Windows NT as
the controlling software.
National Westminster Bank has also adopted Windows NT as the basis for its
client-server developments.
Most organisations are adopting a cautious approach to the transition from
traditional centralized computer to client-server systems, however.
Paymaster, formerly the Paymaster General's Office, is typical - 'we are
introducing client-server slowly - function by function. We have started
with electronic mail and access to shared spreadsheet and are moving on to
introducing more function on desktop PCS,' says Mr Derick Harbottle,
director of information technology at Paymaster.
After many years of relying on an ICL mainframe computer to do everything,
Paymaster has embarked on an ambitious plan to integrate up to 800 users
into a three-layer client-server system using hardware from Olivetti and
software from Novell and Oracle.
The ICL mainframe will eventually become no more than a database server.
'We have a heritage of 'legacy' systems on mainframes and we had to see if
it was practical to move away from the mainframe. After a rigorous
right-sizing study to see if it was feasible, we opted for a staged approach
with a pilot project to start,' says Mr Harbottle. Paymaster's move to
client-server is the result of the same commercial pressure faced by
business. Following changes in the UK government's approach to public
services and the introduction of market testing, Paymaster has had to become
aware of the service it offers it customers.
'We have made the change for sound business reasons. We are forward-looking
company and need do more than sit back and let things just happen,' says Mr
Harbottle.
He goes on to emphasise that client-server should not be seen as a
technology solution - but a business solution which brings greater
flexibility to building information systems. He is also wary of expecting
too much in the way of cost savings - 'some people are talking about the
technical issues or the cost-saving issues. We prefer to concentrate on the
business benefits which will come from client-server,' he explains.
Any move to a new technology is bound to cause new problems and the
transition to client-server systems is no exception. Paymaster's cautious
approach - with carefully phased introduction of the new system alongside
the old, is an object lesson in how to move to client-server with the
minimum amount of pain.
'We try to avoid being at the bleeding edge of technology. Rather than
inventing our own, we would rather steel other people's wheels,' observes Mr
Harbottle.

Users pin hopes on ATM - Network capacity / Demand for space on computer
networks keeps exceeding supply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE BLACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The present structures of local area networks of personal computers,
Ethernet and Token Ring, running at 10 megabits and 16 megabits per second
respectively, will soon be unable to cope with the growing volume of
traffic.
As users compete for communications channels, the actual speed of delivery
to each of them is often only a tenth of the network's theoretical capacity.
When more users come on to the network, its performance degrades.
Network managers have responded to the rising demand by exploiting existing
systems more efficiently. This is one of the main reasons for the enormous
growth in sales of devices such as intelligent hubs, bridges and routers in
the past couple of years. They have helped a lot, but it will not be enough.
Fibre Distributed Data Interface, running at 100MBps, has been regarded by
many as the probable solution, but it has so far proved too expensive. FDDI
and Fast Ethernet, also running at 100MBps, may be overtaken by ATM
(Asynchronous Transfer Mode).
Experts now agree that ATM is the only technology that can give the
necessary transmission speed for communicating image, voice and data
together in real time at an acceptable price. It can use existing wiring,
which will help keep down the cost. It may therefore be what is needed to
start the long- expected spread of multimedia applications.
Ethernet and Token Ring have suffered from a lack of standards, which has
meant a large amount of conversion of data from one format to another. The
move to ATM, which is rapidly becoming standardised, may be equivalent to
removing official frontier controls.
Unlike its predecessors, ATM uses a technology known as cell relay, which
takes advantage of the high speed transmission capacity of fibre optic
cables. It handles data in fixed length cells rather than variable length
packets, which is thought to be more efficient. This should push the speed
of transmission up to a maximum of around 2.4 gigabits per second.
For backbone systems in office and factory buildings, 155MBps is expected to
be the usual speed; 45MBps may be typical for combined data, voice and
video. ATM will not put upper or lower limits on the transmission speed but
use that which is appropriate to the application.
Other important advantages of ATM are that it is a much simpler system than
the older ones and can be used for both local area and wide area networks,
which should further reduce migration costs and ease the task of network
management.
ATM was invented to serve the needs of the public telephone companies, but
was soon taken over by the pioneering computer companies of California's
Silicon Valley.
The ATM Forum, which was set up by the computer companies in 1991 and now
has over 200 members, comes out with a new standard every couple of months
and is rapidly completing the set which is needed.
It is setting a pace which the telephone companies cannot match. Mr Tim
Ward, strategic marketing director for Network Equipment Technologies (NET),
a leading company in the forum, admits that there has been a lot of 'hype'
for ATM but argues that it was necessary.
'It has turned people's attention to ATM as a local area network
technology,' he says.
'ATM-ready' LAN products began to come on to the market in 1992. ATM on LANs
is forecast to prove a more cost-effective solution than on WANs or on the
public carriers' services. So it is likely to be adopted for LANs long
before the telephone companies have worked out the details of their
offerings.
The largest corporations will probably be the first to take up the
technology. Banks want it in their dealing rooms, where video and news
agency reports may be joined on a single fibre optic feed.
Users are only experimenting with it at the moment; live applications will
follow in a year or two. Many of the telephone companies worldwide will
introduce their first ATM services this year.
According to Mr Sean Phelan, principal analyst for market research firm
Yankee Group Europe, pricing presents them with a dilemma. 'If they price it
too low they risk cannibalising their current revenues, but if they price it
too high the uptake will be very small,' he says.
'The arrival of ATM therefore represents a big opportunity for new entrants
into the telecommunications business.' For most users the big question is
when they should try to move to ATM.
A report last year by the Ovum consultancy said that potential users of ATM,
especially in Europe, were cynical about it, partly because current ATM
products did not match their expectations. Ovum said that ATM provided far
more than enough bandwidth but added that this did not translate into the
functionality required.
One of the authors of the report, Mr Iain Stevenson, says that their
cynicism may be dispelled by a number of new products from hub and router
vendors which will be delivered this year. He notes the telephone companies
are worried that ATM may leave them 'holding the string' for users who have
equipment on their premises which is intelligent enough for them to manage
their own networks.
'The telephone companies have to get closer to their customers to find out
what services they really want,' he says.
One of the technical concerns about ATM has been that receiving devices may
not be able to cope with the throughput. Data cells could get lost in the
pipeline and need to be re- sent.
'With only a small disruption an encyclopedia could have gone by,' notes Mr
Jim Boyle, vice-president of wide area networking for IBM. IBM has stated
that ATM is one of its key technology strategies and it is investing heavily
in research into network congestion. The design of ATM networks will be
difficult, at least until flow control software matures.
Users may therefore be wise to hire systems integrators to build these
networks for them.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (9): A
whole new shopping experience - Customers may one day don headsets for a
'virtual reality' armchair walk around their favourite stores
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imagine, 20 years from now, a couple want to hold a dinner party but cannot
decide what to cook.
They reach for a handset and call up some ideas from an electronic recipe
book on the high definition video screen in their living room. Unsure
whether one particular dish might be too difficult, they press a button for
a video recording of a chef showing how to prepare the meal step-by-step
Satisfied they can manage, they move on to the wine. Further clicks on the
remote control call up video recordings of winemakers wandering around their
vineyards, talking about their wines.
The choices made, the couple transmit an order via the handset to their
favourite food retailer. A few hours later, the ingredients and wine will be
delivered to a special hatch at their home. They may even be delivered at
the same time as the couple's regular, weekly shopping order.
Such a vision remains a fantasy. But retailers believe it could be a
reality, even a commonplace, by early in the next century. What will make it
possible is the conjunction of multi-media technology, allowing sound,
pictures, graphics and text to come together on one screen, with fibre-optic
technology, enabling huge amounts of information to be sent at high speed to
and from consumers' homes.
Technological advances in the past 20 years have revolutionised the way
retailers run their businesses, producing huge gains in operating
efficiency, but they have not fundamentally changed the shopping experience.
In the next 20 years, however, technology could revolutionise shopping
itself.
It will change the view of shops as simply repositories for goods to be sold
to the public. It is also likely to break down the barriers between
shopping, recreation, and even education.
The biggest growth area is expected to be TV shopping - already booming in
the US. The cable home shopping industry there - dominated by Home Shopping
Network and QVC (Quality, Value, Convenience) - where customers watch a
succession of products on screen and order by telephone, generated turnover
of Dollars 2.3bn last year. So-called 'infomercials', advertisements used to
sell products directly to the public, pulled in a further Dollars 700m.
On-line computer shopping services, in their infancy but expected to
mushroom, generated Dollars 200m.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, which has just completed a year-long, Dollars 1.2m survey
with sponsors NCR, Telxon and Citicorp into Retailing in the 21st century,
says that as the number of available cable channels increases, conventional
shopping channels are expected to proliferate, probably targeted at
increasingly narrow age and interest groups.
Established retailers are already seizing upon TV shopping as a potent
selling force. Macy's, the US department store group, is launching a
shopping channel later this year.
The next stage, as more sophisticated communication networks are developed,
could be the grouping together of information providers, network operators
and transaction companies. That would enable customers to select purchases
and transmit orders to retailers via a remote control, as described above.
An essential part of the growth of such channels is likely to be fast,
secure delivery of products to consumers' homes, posing new challenges for
retailers.
However, shops as physical entities will not die out. Many consumers will
always want the opportunity to examine or try on products before they
purchase. Convenience stores for top-up and impulse purchases are likely to
remain indispensable - although they may become more specialised.
But stores will have to ensure they provide a 'value-added' shopping
experience and come up with new attractions to lure shoppers away from their
TV screens.
Technological advances are expected soon to make shopping, especially
grocery shopping, less onerous. One way will be to end queues at check-outs
by developing shopping trolleys that scan purchases as customers make them
and automatically deduct the cost from their credit or charge card.
Symbol Technologies and Videocard have already developed a trolley with a
blanket of laser beams across the top which can read barcodes of goods being
put into the trolley, from any angle. The trolleys are being trialled in the
Netherlands.
The next step may be using silicon chips or tags which can be read by a
radio beam on the trolley. A prototype system has been developed by the
South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in conjunction
with the British Technology Group.
Eventually, however, customers may not need to put goods into trolleys
themselves. Supermarkets - and other stores - may display just one example
of each product. Customers will walk around the shop and wave a wand across
a bar code on the shelf to order and pay for a product. Their order will be
assembled behind the scenes by staff.
Surplus selling space might be used instead for cooking classes and
demonstrations, or multi-media kiosks offering information.
For those who do not insist on seeing or handling every item, the process
could be taken further. Why walk around a supermarket when you could be,
say, enjoying a meal in a restaurant, making selections from an electronic
shopping catalogue and picking up your order when you have finished your
coffee?
As well as making shopping more enjoyable, advances in information and
communications technology will give customers more choice and control.
Stores may no longer stock products, but instead offer customers the
opportunity, assisted by knowledgeable staff or consultants, to customise or
even design their own merchandise - for example to choose the colour, fabric
and precise size they want items of clothing to be made in, with the order
transmitted instantaneously to a factory and the finished product despatched
the same day.
In the US, the Blockbuster retail chain in a venture with IBM is allowing
customers to select tracks for and record their own compact discs on the
spot.
Japan is experimenting with mobile production units in trucks or vans for
goods such as spectacles and contact lenses, which take orders by telephone
and deliver products rapidly to a customer's home or workplace.
Themed and 'experiential' stores, such as those operated by Disney and
Warner Brothers, are also expected to increase, using technology such as
virtual reality to sell goods.
In the long run, customers may not stare at video screens at home, but
instead - a prospect that still sounds like science fiction - don headsets
that allow them to wander around virtual reality stores, or even virtual
shopping malls.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (7): The
paperless office pays off for structured tasks - The electronic office / The
paperless office is as far off as ever for what might be termed wide-ranging
jobs. But for highly structured tasks, such as handling insurance claims or
invoices, cutting down on paper can lead to substantial gains in
productivity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A number of new technologies make it possible for modern offices to cut back
on paperwork - they include image processing (which converts paper documents
into electronic images), workflow (which controls the flow of work between a
group of workers), electronic mail and electronic data interchange.
Image processing and workflow:
At General Accident's 1-2-1 division, which sells insurance directly to the
public, a Pounds 1.5 million AT&amp;T GIS image processing system has speeded up
claims processing and increased productivity by 20 to 30 per cent.
Bob Thomson, personal lines operations manager for General Accident, says:
'We're working in a very competitive environment and wanted to make
significant savings. A lot of resources were going into filing and looking
for paper, and we wanted all documents to be accessible from a single
source.'
Now the 1,000 to 1,500 items that arrive in the post every day are scanned
into the image processing system and assembled into electronic files, which
can be viewed on a computer. 1-2-1's 54 staff (who spend most of the time on
the phone) thus have everything they need to work on a claim on screen,
without having to get up and look for files.
Image processing and workflow software are also being used at the UK offices
of US oil company, Amerada Hess. They have enabled the company to process
higher volumes of invoices without increasing the number of accounts staff.
Amerada Hess' system, developed in conjunction with US image processing
company Filenet, scans every paper invoice into a computer system.
If the invoice is straightforward and the goods have been received and match
the original purchase order, the bill is paid. If it needs to be verified by
an engineer or a senior accountant, it is sent to their computer screens
electronically via Digital Equipment's Teamlinks package.
Once approved the invoice is automatically sent to the general ledger
department for a cheque to be issued. The system is faster and more
efficient than the old system in which all accounting information was typed
in to the computer from a paper invoice, and sometimes added to by an
engineer or accountant, and it now takes only minutes to locate one of the
50,000 invoices Amerada receives each year, rather than a day or longer.
Electronic mail
However, image processing and workflow are not the only route to reducing
paper. David Ferris, a British-born but US-based electronic mail (e-mail)
consultant says that use of e-mail can cut back on paper and give huge gains
in productivity.
He says that these gains will not necessarily come from interpersonal
messaging of the 'Are you free for lunch on Friday' variety, but rather from
the use of 'mail-enabled' applications, where an application such as word
processing or electronic forms has an e-mail option built in. Mr Ferris
says: 'Automating simple business forms, such as expenses, can cut a
company's costs by between one and two per cent of revenues.'
For example, time sheets created using JetForm software and sent via Lotus
Development's cc:Mail or Microsoft Mail, save California-based
diskette-maker and CD-ROM duplicator, Trace Dollars 270 a year per employee.
The system costs Dollars 44 a year per employee, giving a financial return
of more than 400 per cent a year.
E-mail can also provide other, less measurable benefits, such as improved
decision making, better communication across time zones, more up-to-date
market information, faster reactions to unexpected events, and shorter
product-development times from geographically dispersed teams. E-mail can be
used on all sorts of computer, but the fastest growing area of the market is
e-mail for local-area networks of PCs.
Another growth area is e-mail for executives who spend a lot of time out of
the office. One of the latest products designed for mobile e-mail users is
Lotus' cc:Mail Remote for Windows. This allows executives to exchange
messages with their in-house Lan e-mail system and keep in touch with what
is going on back at base. Larry Crume, vice president of messaging at Lotus,
predicts that it will be the company's biggest selling product this year and
could hit sales of a million copies.
Electronic data interchange:
At present, many large companies use e-mail primarily for internal
communications. By contrast, electronic data interchange (EDI) is used
mainly for inter-company communications, where cutting out paper can
significantly speed up the processing and transmission of information. (EDI
or paperless trading is the name given to the exchange of structured
business documents, such as orders and invoices, directly between
computers.)
For example, a sales management system underpinned by GE Information
Service's public EDI network, helped to cut the time it took for US orders
to arrive at Benetton's Italian clothing factories from three-to-ten days to
just hours.
Use of EDI is expanding. In Britain, 8,400 companies have adopted it and new
types of paperless EDI message are being developed all the time. For
example, a UK EDI standard for utility bills has been developed and is
waiting for European endorsement, and despatch and binding messages are
being developed for users in printing and publishing.
But large scale users of EDI have one big problem - how to communicate with
even very small suppliers or customers via EDI.
One solution is to use what is known as hybrid EDI where those who aren't
equipped to receive EDI documents electronically receive them on paper. A
number of options are available including BT's EDI-to-fax service for its
EDI*Net customers and the Royal Mail's Edipost (EDI-to-post). Here, EDI
messages are sent to the Royal Mail's electronic data centre and then
converted to paper for delivery by post. Recipients can phone back their
responses, which in turn will be converted into EDI messages.
Barriers to the paperless office
Hybrid EDI is a sensible compromise but it underlines just how difficult it
is to get rid of paper when paper is accessible to every business from the
corner shop to the multinational.
Another problem is that electronic images of paper documents are not legally
admissible in court, even though they can include signatures, and are
difficult to alter.
For example, Amerada Hess files copies of its paper invoices, in case its
auditors, consortia partners or the VAT office want to see them, and General
Accident is keeping paper records of documents scanned into its imaging
system on site for six months before deciding what to do with them. Jeff
Goldberg, an analyst at researchers Dataquest, says: 'The promised paperless
office has become the 'paperfull' office, partly because computers have not
yet achieved the readability, or portability, of paper.'
This is good news for printer companies - 'more and more data is being
stored on computers and people want to output it in a variety of ways,' says
Kevin Spinks, printer business manager at printer company, Lexmark. 'This
creates more and more paper and the demand for printers is growing at 15 to
20 per cent a year. I can't see the paperless office taking off this
century.'

The Tokyo headquarters of NEC, the electronics company, has one of the
world's most advanced commercial communications systems, writes Michael
Wiltshire.
Built on the site where NEC first began operations in 1899, the 43-storey
Super Tower, pictured above, features the NEC's Super Aladdin system for
total office automation. This includes electronic mail, electronic statement
and receipt systems for the collection and distribution of documents, an
electronic bulletin board, closed circuit and satellite television services
which links NEC's three north American subsidiaries - NEC America, NEC
Electronics and NEC Technologies.
Other features used by the 6,000 staff of the Super Tower include electronic
telephone notebooks which contain the 35,000 telephone numbers within the
company. There are also automatic message services on telephone terminals.
Office facilities of the Super Tower also include electronic secretarial
services for setting up schedules and monitoring business progress. Staff
work to a flexitime system - 'this seeks to encourage the self-esteem of
company employees by giving them more control and responsibility over their
working time,' says NEC.

Focus for all banking activity - Despite the high cost of applying the
latest information technology, the banks - faced with mounting competition -
can no longer survive without persistent investment in this area / Michael
Dempsey highlights IT applications in finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'We don't have warehouses full of cash. We have information about cash -
that is our product.' Thus, Peter Lazard, head of technology strategy and
research at Abbey National sums up the relationship between banking and
information technology, (IT).
On the surface, computer technology has become the focus of all banking
activity. The real assets of any financial institution are now locked away
in digital form. The rise of the technology-driven bank has coincided with
fierce commercial pressures and a relentless struggle to keep overheads
down.
IT briefly served to offer a 'holy grail' during the 1980s. Banks signed up
for huge projects on the grounds that more information meant better
business. By and large, they ended the decade disillusioned. Computers had
proved their worth, handling vast quantities of data but they had not come
cheap, and on the way banks found themselves employing a growing army of
programmers and systems analysts.
With financial deregulation in the UK, retail banks have faced new
competitors. Abbey National is a building society turned bank. Lazard notes
that Abbey National has used computers for thirty years. Historically this
meant large expensive mainframe machines. Falling hardware prices and the
event of the micro-processor saw computing break out of the mainframe world.
IT was suddenly available across the board.
'Technology was a barrier, due to cost. Now it is a gateway, an enabler
rather than an inhibitor. That is very significant to us.' Lazard says.
Abbey National operates systems ranging in size and supplier. Large
mainframes from IBM and Unisys still provide the backbone for essential
services such as savings, current accounts and insurance packages, but the
advent of powerful workstations that do not require IT specialists to drive
them has revolutionised the branch network. Abbey National has recently
completed a four-year programme to install rings of workstations linked into
local networks in each of its 685 branches.
These Olivetti machines are tied to a dedicated communications workstation
at each site, which is networked on a national basis through lines leased
from British Telecom. The object of the exercise is data-sharing through the
communications host machine. In theory, any member of staff can work with
any application on any workstation. The entire branch programme, including
banking software, cost Pounds 95m. Over the last seven years Abbey National
has invested a total of nearly Pounds 200m in IT.
Large though it seems, banks can no longer survive without persistent
investment in IT, a condition Lazard defines as a growing dependency on
information as a product. In theory, IT should allow banks to make better
use of that information.
One of Abbey National's computers is an AT&amp;T Teradata database engine, an
extremely powerful box dedicated to analysing customer data. The price tag
on the entire Teradata installation is around Pounds 10m, but this expensive
specialist tool is the only option if Abbey National is to exploit customer
profiles and mount direct sales campaigns.
Expert systems are computer programmes designed to replicate and multiply
human knowledge. Barclays Bank is employing Lending Advisor to back up
decisions on commercial lending. Software licences from supplier
Syntelligence cost upwards of Pounds 600,000. If the expert system can
succeed in producing a coherent and secure lending policy it is money well
spent.
The world of the expert system is a clear example of IT coming to be used as
a precision tool. In the past, vast banking IT projects stumbled because
computers were employed in an indiscriminate fashion. Banks have learnt to
target IT to deal with specific problems. Thus, multimedia, the mixing of
sound and video images with data on one screen, is seen as having large
potential for banks.
Multimedia computer terminals represent the logical next step in the march
of the automatic teller machine. Condensing all the human functions of
retail branch banking on to a machine has obvious attractions for
institutions determined to slash payrolls.
Some banks are seizing on multimedia to squeeze extra revenue out of
existing floorspace. Turin-based San Paolo Bank is installing Olivetti
multimedia terminals in its branches. San Paolo rents out space on these
machines to third parties who use the interactive video display to sell
services. The Trustee Savings Bank (TSB) has 1350 branches. and is
experimenting with multimedia equipment from AT&amp;T's NCR arm in two branches,
in Newcastle and Watford.
Paul Swainbrook's job as director of Teleservice at the TSB is to set up a
telephone banking system. He has worked on the multimedia experiments and is
blunt about the impact of such technology - 'customer shock proved much more
powerful than you might think.' The TSB discovered that without human
intervention, in the form of a Customer Care Officer, its account holders
would not do business with a box.
This experiment justified a policy of applying IT in a restrained fashion.
'It's about not being supply-driven,' says Swainbrook. 'You start out by
asking what the customer wants, and then give him the choice whether or not
to use the technology. Why persist with a solution if the customer doesn't
want it?'
The TSB is embarking on remote telephone banking courtesy of IT. Cheaper and
more powerful computers have enabled banks to set up parallel institutions
such as Teleservice within a practical timeframe. Teleservice pools the
skills of computer and telephony integration specialist Datapoint, telecoms
provider Mercury and IT supplier Unisys.
The project will cost tens of millions of pounds, but by a judicious
marriage of telecoms and IT, TSB will acquire a new banking structure
without the overheads of a physical branch network. Teleservice will follow
in the steps of Midland Bank's First Direct operation. Technology is the
enabler, but public interest is the motivator. Banks are finally taking a
firm grip on the IT toolbox.

FT  16 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Share prices respond to strong gains
in bonds - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong gains in British government bonds and further indications that
economic recovery is showing through in corporate results laid the
foundation for a 34-point advance in the FT-SE 100 Index yesterday. Trading
volume gathered pace as the stock market moved ahead to a confident close.
Investors were encouraged by good news on US inflation, by confidence ahead
of the Bund-esbank's money market repos tender today and by another round of
dividend increases from UK companies. The final reading put the FT-SE 100 at
3,267.4, with some analysts predicting that the 3,300 mark could be
challenged again before the end of the week.
A week heavy with important economic statistics saw the opening of
yesterday's session dominated by prospects for the US producer price index,
announced at midsession in London.
News that the core index had risen by only 0.1 per cent in February,
reducing the likelihood of a tightening in Federal Reserve credit policy,
was well taken in Europe.
UK equities, which had made modest progress during the morning, began to
move up strongly behind gains of more than a full point in long-dated
government securities.
On the domestic front, the switch in market sentiment in favour of signs of
economic recovery was encouraged first by news that UK construction industry
orders had jumped by 16 per cent in the three months to January, and then by
strong profits and dividend announcements from the construction and building
sectors.
An increase of around one-third in the dividend payment from Wolseley,
Britain's leading builders merchant, reinforced market confidence that
higher payouts will provide the drive for the stock market.
Little heed was paid to the latest distributive trades survey from the
Confederation of British Industry, which suggested a slowdown in the rate of
retail sales increase.
Store and consumer issues mostly followed the market trend, as investors
took the view that economic recovery will provide the basis for higher
levels of consumer spending. Heavy trading in Barclays reflected continuing
dividend optimism. The strength of sterling failed to deter shares in the
big exporting firms.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index gained 16.8 at 3,902.5 as buying spread through the
list of building and construction shares, many of which are outside the
FT-SE 100 stocks. By the end of the session, Seaq volume, at 616.1m shares,
showed a 10 per cent increase from Monday's total. Retail, or customer,
business on Monday was worth Pounds 1.25bn. While a little below last week's
average, retail business in equities remained healthily profitable for
London-based securities firms.
While sounding fully confident last night, market strategists pointed out
that today will bring significant tests for shares and bonds in the form of
the latest data on domestic retail sales, unemployment, average earnings and
unit wage costs. All will be scanned for evidence of progress in the
domestic economy, as well as for inflationary pressures.
With Wall Street a shade lower at the London close, it was clear that
attention had switched to Germany and that the UK market will focus closely
today on the progress and outcome of the Bundesbank repos tender, where some
analysts hope to see rates trimmed more sharply than they were last week.

'Evolutionary rather than revolutionary' - Multimedia in the office / Bill
Gates, founder and chairman of Microsoft, has poured scorn on most of the
multimedia trials in the US and Europe, reports Alan Cane. Microsoft is
meanwhile investing Dollars 100m a year in multimedia and aims to set the
agenda in the technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Microsoft, the world's largest personal computer software company, is
harnessing its resources to a new goal: leadership in the design of
multimedia systems.
It is already investing over Dollars 100m a year - out of an research and
development budget of Dollars 473m - on the critical operating software. Mr
Bill Gates, the company's founder and chairman, said earlier this month that
the company had more people working on multimedia than any other software
group.
The implication is that the company wants to establish its software as the
global standard in multimedia just as its MS/DOS and Windows operating
systems are the world standard for IBM's design of personal computers.
There have been some early clues: Microsoft is already working with Sega,
the Japanese games console manufacturer, on an operating system for a new
machine, although Mr Gates says the project is small and divorced from
Microsoft's mainline operating systems development.
Some weeks ago, it bought Soft Image, a Canadian company which is market
leader in the esoteric discipline of software for moving picture animation.
The special effects in the film Jurassic Park are its work.
Furthermore, it has announced it intends to test its multimedia software in
collaboration with Tele-Communications Inc.,( TCI), the largest US cable
operator. A first fruit from the venture will be a new channel of
programming aimed at the consumer market for computer hardware, software and
accessories.
What Microsoft intends to provide is the operating software which will
manage the flow of information of all kinds on to high speed networks and
the software which will connect it to personal computer operating systems in
the home or office. It may also provide some of the applications - a
personal money management program, for example.
Mr Gates says 'there are a lot of companies developing software for the
'information highway,' just as there were a lot of companies involved in
operating systems at the beginning of the personal computer business.
Everybody who is doing multimedia software will have lots of pilots. Based
on the quality of those pilots, some will emerge stronger than others'.
Mr Gates said Microsoft would begin testing home multimedia services in the
US and Europe in 1995. He did not expect substantial returns on his
investment for five years, although he thought that there would be
substantive developments in multimedia in 1996-97 with entire cities
converted to interactive networks.
Multimedia and the 'information superhighway,' the high-capacity network
which will link vast repositories of information with modified television
sets or personal computers, are creating intense interest among computer
companies, telecommunications organisations and entertainment firms. They
are jockeying to take advantage of what are expected to be lucrative new
business opportunities.
Bill Gates, however, argues that most are taking the wrong approach - 'dead
ends' were how he described them - 'because the user-interface is so simple,
and because they do not tie in to personal computers in the right way, the
results will be disappointing. The revenue and the usage that comes out of
them will not justify the huge infrastructure costs.'
most of the trials to date have been designed to exploit domestic
multimedia, offering, typically, menus of video films for home viewing, Mr
Gates says that business will make use of the multimedia first.
'The first widespread use of these capabilities will be in business,' he
predicted. 'It will involve things like video-conferencing and collaboration
which would enable you to do your job without going into the office. Or it
could help companies find expertise to help them out without the expert
having to travel.
'The network itself could create electronic markets able to find a resource
of any type.'
'So, what in the past we have seen as electronic markets for currencies or
stocks will move into items of all types where chequeing references and
other kinds of working together can be done very effectively in electronic
form.'
'This will be done by extending the range of the personal computer. One of
the early symptoms will be very low cost video conferencing where a PC is
connected up to an ISDN (integrated services digital network). Within two or
three years this will be extremely widespread.
(Intel, which makes the microprocessors used in the majority of the world's
personal computers, earlier this year announced a low-cost set of components
capable of turning a personal computer into a video-conferencing terminal).
Mr Gates thought that multimedia in the office would be evolutionary rather
than revolutionary, driven by proven technologies like electronic mail -
'the benefits of electronic mail are unbelievable. We could not run
Microsoft without that capability.
'Today, some think of electronic mail and work group software and the
Internet (an open, publicly available computer network spanning several
continents) as separate things, but with some enhancements to Windows due in
less than a year, we will bring all these things together.'
Once the technology and benefits have been established in a business
environment, that would be the time to move into the home.
Mr Gates was critical of the narrow range of many of the current multimedia
trials: 'Some of the early pilots will be particularly embarrassing because
they will not have the breadth of applications,' he said.
'The network operators running these pilots are acting against their own
interests because they are going to prove exactly what they do not want to
prove - that there will not be enough revenue generated to justify building
the infrastructure.'
'Until you have a broad range of applications, you will never be able to
demonstrate the true potential of these systems. That is why instead of
doing crummy pilots in 1994, we will start our trials in 1995.'
He extended his criticism to Oracle, the US database specialist with which
British Telecommunications has formed an alliance to test interactive
entertainment services in the home. Oracle will provide the software and
systems integration: 'I'm sure Oracle will change its approach because it is
a terrible approach,' he said.
Bill Gates' comments have to be seen against a background of intense
competition in the nascent multimedia business. Furthermore, he has never
been slow to promote Microsoft's efforts and pick holes in the competition.

Computers which appeal to the senses - The multimedia market is still in its
infancy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOIA SHILLINGFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Multimedia brings sound and video to the personal computer. Like sex, it
promises to appeal to the senses. Unlike sex, multimedia has yet to appeal
to a wide audience.
However, one application which seems likely to increase the take-up rate of
multimedia is desktop video-conferencing. The technology is also suitable
for point-of-sale promotions, interactive educational/training software and
 -in very skilled hands - designing multimedia presentations.
Here and on the following page we look at two areas with most potential:
desktop video-conferencing and multimedia at the point of sale.
Desktop video-conferencing: Some computers now come fully equipped for
videoconferencing, allowing users to transmit live video images of
themselves to other, similarly-equipped users, and to see on their PC the
person they are talking to.
For example, Sun Microsystems, the US workstation company, says its new
SPARCclassic Unix workstation, which costs Pounds 4,340 (Dollars 6,510), is
the industry's lowest cost, fully-configured multimedia workstation. This
includes camera, real-time video-capture and compression and a storage disk.
But most users will have to buy a multimedia kit if they want to carry out a
video-conference in a window on their personal computer.
In April BT and Olivetti will begin selling multimedia kits which allow pc
users to do this. The BT-Olivetti kits will cost Pounds 3,595; they include
a small video camera which sits on top of the PC, a card which slots into
the PC, and software.
In addition, the kit makes it possible for users to transmit still video
images, photographs or sound. BT says the kit will send video at 15-frames a
second when it goes on sale.
At this speed, video images will be rather jerky (it may look as if the
person you are talking to has just come back from a boozy lunch). So
'meeting' someone for the first time via a desktop video-conference is not
ideal if you want to make a good impression. It is more suitable for
follow-up 'meetings,' where being able to see the person you are talking to
may give a better idea of their reactions.
Will this form of communication catch on?
Yes - according to Judith Jeffcoate, of the research consultancy Ovum. She
believes that between 1996 and the end of 1998, revenues from pcs equipped
for video will exceed those from conventional videoconferencing equipment.
Suppliers are also upbeat about the potential market. An increasing number
have developed desktop video-conferencing products. They include
Canada-based Northern Telecom (with the Visit system distributed by UK
computer dealers P&amp;P); Intel, the US semiconductor company; AT&amp;T; BT and IBM
(with Coco); Apple (in the US); and Olivetti.
Many of these products allow people engaged in a video-conference to point
to or edit information they can both see on their screens. Intel says that
with its system, users at far-flung sites can edit a report together, both
looking at the same version on their screens.
The system is modular and it is possible for US users to buy the ProShare
shared editing software for Dollars 99 without the full videoconferencing
kit (which costs Dollars 1,200 to Dollars 2,500). Intel is spending Dollars
100m (Pounds 67m) a year on what it calls personal conferencing technology.
Its multimedia kits will go on sale in Europe this year.
To use one of its kits, the user must have a pc based on a powerful
microprocessor (486DX or Pentium) and must install an ISDN (Integrated
Services Digital Network) telephone line. Most other desktop
videoconferencing systems are also designed to work with ISDN, a high-speed
digital dial-up service.
Simon Goodwin, of AT&amp;T Global Information Solutions, expects the multimedia
market to be worth Dollars 900m by the end of 1995. He believes that growth
will be fuelled by three factors: falling prices for multimedia components;
the acceptance and roll-out of Euro-ISDN, replacing proprietary national
ISDN communication; and the combined efforts of important European
industrial participators in exploring new opportunities and requirements for
videoconferencing products.
Point-of-sale promotions: Another potential growth area for multimedia is in
point-of-sale (POS) devices. These can be used not only to promote products
but also to collect information about customer preferences.
Many POS devices developed so far are linked into ISDN, so that they can
relay customer orders back to head office or be updated with the latest
product and price information.
Examples include:
An interactive point-of-sales terminal which Ford plans to use in its car
showrooms to enable customers to see the car of their choice in the colour
and configuration they want - for example, four doors, spoilers.
A system which helps a customer to choose a hairstyle from a database of
4,000 styles. Hairstyles can be superimposed on to a video image of the
customer's face to see how he/she would look. (Although the system is used
by only 18 Belgian hairdressers, Comsys of Belgium, its developers, is
undeterred, and has crossed the channel in search of UK business.)
A point-of sale terminal for a big music retailer. This system, developed by
Applied Interactive Marketing (AIM) of Piccadilly Circus, London, allows
customers to sample albums which are to be released in the next few months
(by selecting a track and a seeing a video clip of the singer). Customers
can operate the terminal using touch-screen commands, and indicate which
releases they are interested in buying.
AIM says that developing a multimedia POS system can take as little as three
to four months or up to a year and a half. Costs of developing a system
range from Pounds 15,000 to Pounds 200,000.
Multimedia at the point of sale has a lot to offer. However, 24 multimedia
POS kiosks based in London's Heathrow airport illustrate the main problem
with the technology: most people are unfamiliar with multimedia
terminals/kiosks and are hesitant to try them out.
The colourful Galleria 21 Heathrow kiosks, designed by the John Herbert
Partnership (which was involved in the interior design of Terminal 4), use
AT&amp;T's multimedia technology. At first, people spotted the kiosks and
wondered what they were for. Most people did not know - so they did not use
them. Now the kiosks have been clearly labelled 'Tax free shopping' and AT&amp;T
says usage has increased. They allow travellers to use a touch-sensitive
screen to order goods via credit card.
The terminal works out how much the goods will cost, based on factors such
as which currency is being used in payment, delivery charge, and whether any
duty is payable. The goods thus ordered can be delivered to any destination
in the world within seven working days.
The tale of the 24 kiosks shows that a multimedia screen has only limited
powers of attraction. In order to reach a wider audience, multimedia
products must demonstrate clear benefits.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (2): A
whirlwind of innovation - Business assumptions will be repeatedly challenged
in the next few years as technological advances sweep the world of
communications. Multimedia, mobile computing and groupware are among the hot
topics, as Alan Cane explains here
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE

<TEXT>
The key technologies emerging as the catalyst of the next wave of business
and social change have computing power and communications in common.
Multimedia, mobile computing and groupware are the most promising business
opportunities over the next three years. According to a group of computer
companies canvassed last month by Input, a US-based marketing consultancy,
client-server computing, networking in its various forms and document image
processing were all seen as providing continuing business, but there was
less enthusiasm for last year's fashionable topics including artificial
intelligence and graphic information systems.
The computer company's choices are supported by a diversity of evidence.
Deals like Viacom's Dollars 10bn acquisition last month of Paramount
Communications, the US information and entertainment group, exemplify the
excitement multimedia is generating. In January 1993, 150 US newspapers
published a total of 25 articles about multimedia; in December, the same
newspapers published 425 pieces on the topic.
The market for notebook and subnotebook (hand-held) computers is expected to
grow at 20 per cent or more this year compared with only six per cent or so
for the industry as a whole. Prices of subnotebooks seem set to follow their
desktop equivalents downwards especially with the launch of the Compaq
Contura Aero at under Pounds 1000 and the relaunch later this year of IBM's
Thinkpad 500. There is continuing interest in personal digital assistants
(PDAs) combining computing power with communications despite a muted market
response to the launch of Apple's Newton PDA.
The market for groupware - software designed to run on personal computer
networks to support the co-ordination of office activities and exemplified
by Lotus 'Notes' - looks likely to double in the US and Europe over the next
five years. According to Ovum, a London-based information technology
consultancy, the installed base of PC networks has now reached the critical
mass necessary to provide the incentive for the adoption of groupware.
Elimination of barriers
What has changed over the past few months is the speed at which these
esoteric technologies are becoming realities. Last month, for example, 400
senior telecommunications executives from companies including AT&amp;T, BT, MCI
and Mercury, packed a seminar in the US to hear claims that business and
society would be transformed by multimedia through the elimination of
barriers of time, space and form.
Opening the conference, Mr Rudy Puryear, managing partner, strategic change,
at Andersen Consulting, warned that every business assumption would be
repeatedly challenged in the next few years: 'The mean time between
surprises is shortening,' he said.
Most of the corporations present were already investigating the potential of
multimedia; most had only developed a serious interest in the topic in the
past year.
To a large extent, their enthusiasm is being driven by commercial demands,
rather than customer-need. Telecommunications companies like AT&amp;T, MCI, BT
and Mercury need to generate better margins from their networks by moving
from 'pots' to 'pans' ('plain old telephone services' to 'pretty awesome new
stuff'). Computer companies need to find new ways to encourage customers to
buy more computer power as prices fall to commodity levels. Among those
which have already declared an interest in multimedia are Apple Computer,
Intel, Silicon Graphics and Microsoft as well as the games market leaders
Sega and Nintendo.
Mobile computers and groupware are firmly established in the market place.
There are, however, question marks remaining over the potential of
multimedia. It has not been helped by confusion over what the term implies.
The essential definition is the transformation of information of all kinds -
textual, graphical, still and moving video pictures - into computer language
('bits') in which form it can be transmitted down a single communications
channel - which could be a telephone line or a compact disk - to a modified
television set or personal computer in the office or home.
The service is interactive; customers can send back instructions and
requests through the network. What is important is that different bits of
information are co-mingled in the transmission stream; the system is
responsible for sorting out which are text, which are video and so on.
Dr Nicholas Negroponti, director of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology media laboratory, believes that the impact of multimedia on the
business and social world is inevitable. He points to four trends:
First, the 'disappearing desk top' as executives become peripatetic, using
mobile computers on the move or while working from home.
Second, continuing miniaturisation which will make complex and bulky
technologies such as speech recognition for pcs simple and easily
transported.
Third, increased use of the so-called 'Negroponti switch' - the use of fibre
to bring multimedia to the office and home leaving precious broadcast
bandwidth for mobile telephony and computing.
Fourth, the use of intelligent software 'agents' to roam through electronic
libraries gathering information of interest to their owners.
AT&amp;T already has systems which make use of this advanced concept.
Four elements are required for the profitable development of multimedia
systems:
Powerful computers are needed to store, process and keep track of the bits.
High capacity telecommunications channels are needed to transmit them to
office or home.
There has to be a ready supply of information to feed the system.
The customer must be willing to pay for the new services.
All the technological elements for full scale multimedia are pretty well in
place; the computer power, software and networks capable of transporting
millions of bits a second at reasonable cost. Fibre optic technology is now
staggeringly powerful, capable of carrying 150,000 times the volume of
conventional telephone wires. Fibres can be spun from glass so pure that it
is possible to see through a block 70 miles wide.
Chip technology is making possible the computing power to sort through all
those bits. Dr Wei Yen, a senior vice-president at Silicon Graphics, a US
company which specialises in the manipulation of electronic images, said
that the necessary computing power would be available through the
development of microprocessor chips called 'media engines' with the power of
a supercomputer but cost only Dollars 200 (Pounds 136). His media engine
would be available next year.
Given the ability to make one billion calculations a second, he said,
presenting life-like images on the screen did not present technical
difficulties - 'reality is all mathematics,' he smiled.
The chips, which will process bits 64 at a time like a supercomputer, will
be incorporated first in Nintendo's Reality Immersion Technology, claimed to
allow players to step inside real-time, three dimensional worlds.
Nintendo's involvement gives the clue to the principal remaining problem:
the search for attractive and marketable services to feed the multimedia
machine. Entertainment is an obvious option.
New electronic services
Time Warner Cable, the second largest cable operator in the US, intends to
launch this autumn one of the largest tests yet of multimedia services. It
will, in the first instance, allow customers to watch videos delivered via
their telephone lines. The intention, however, is eventually to offer a
'full service network.'
About 4,000 homes around Orlando in Florida are being wired up for the
trial, which could pave the way for a fuller range of electronic services,
such as home banking and shopping.
The Orlando trial uses a combination of fibre optics and coaxial cable for
transmission; in the UK, BT intends to offer a video-on-demand service
offering acceptable picture quality over ordinary telephone lines.
The intention had been to open the service next month; Time Warner announced
it would be delayed earlier this month to allow - 'additional refinements of
the underlying system software and the set-top terminal.'
Coupled with the collapse at about the same time of the proposed merger
between Bell Atlantic and the cable operator Tele-Communications Inc.,
observers were noting that the path to the establishment of successful
multimedia systems will not be that easy.
Many observers, indeed, believe that multimedia will initially be driven by
business applications. An option is telecommuting. France Telecom is
experimenting with a range of technologies including electronic mail and
groupware which could be combined so employees can work from home or
electronic telecommuting centres.

Shoot-out between PowerPC and Intel's Pentium - Personal computers, the
technology battle intensifies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Apple Computer's introduction of the first PowerPC Macintosh personal
computers blows the starting whistle on what promises to be one of the
toughest technology competitions in the history of the personal computer
industry.
On the PowerPC team, together with Apple, will be Motorola and International
Business Machines. Together, the three companies have co-developed a
microprocessor architecture which they aim to establish as a new industry
standard for PCs. They face the reigning champions of the PC microprocessor
market, Intel and its league of PC-manufacturing technology partners, led by
IBM.
One of the most curious aspects of this contest is that IBM is playing on
both sides. Long a close ally of Intel, IBM is the largest manufacturer of
Intel microprocessor-based PCs and says it intends to remain so. However,
the computer company is also a co-developer and manufacturer of PowerPC and
has stated that the new technology is central to its future strategy.
This ambiguity aside, the contest is a straight-forward shoot out between
PowerPC and Intel's Pentium, the latest version of its long-established
'x86' microprocessor lineage.
PowerPC has a Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architecture.
Theoretically, this suggests that it may be faster than Intel's Pentium.
However, PowerPC lacks the critical software base of Intel's microprocessors
and its performance in commercial systems is relatively unproven.
In contrast, Intel's Pentium has a huge head start in the marketplace as the
successor of the widely used Intel 386 and 486 microprocessors, the 'brains'
of most PCs in use today.
The Intel chips run Microsoft's popular MS-DOS and Windows operating system
software and the thousands of application programs designed to work with
them.
Apple's debut of PowerPC-based Macintosh computers will be a critical test
of the new technology. Apple is expected to launch three 'PowerMac'
computers ranging in price from about Dollars 2,400 to about Dollars 4,000
to replace its current 'Quadra' models aimed at business users. Apple says
that it intends to convert 40 per cent of its Macintosh shipments to PowerPC
by year's end, with the complete changeover occurring within three to four
years.
For Apple, the PowerPC represents an important transition from Motorola's
68000 line of microprocessors, which it has used since the introduction of
the Macintosh computer 12 years ago. Apple needed a new microprocessor to
keep pace with competitors using Intel's chips, but its decision to join
with IBM and Motorola in developing a brand new architecture makes the
transition more risky.
PowerPC's may have a speed advantage over Pentium. However, among existing
Apple customers the PowerMac may be judged as much for its compatibility
with existing Macintosh software as for its raw performance.
This could give the PowerPC a rough start in the personal computer market.
According to industry reports, about 90 per cent of existing Macintosh
software will run on the new Apple computers, but only via emulation
software which will significantly slow down performance.
Thus, although PowerPC may be theoretically capable of outpacing the Intel
Pentium, that may not be the practical experience of the first users of
personal computers based on the new microprocessor.
Apple says that about 75 application programs designed specifically for the
PowerMac will be available when the computers are introduced, and that
hundreds more are in development.
However, software companies are unlikely to make development of applications
programs for the PowerMac a high priority. Apple says that it expects to
sell up to one million PowerMac computers in the first 12 months. While this
would be a significant achievement for Apple, it presents a relatively
limited market for software designed solely for the PowerMac.
In contrast, Intel expects about 15 per cent of all PCs sold this year, or
approximately seven million units, to be based on its Pentium chips. Most of
the remaining 40m PCs will contain Intel 486 microprocessors. Thus,
Intel-based PCs represent a far larger potential market for software
applications than the PowerMac.
Therefore even if the PowerMac exceeds Apple's expectations, it will hardly
make a dent in Intel's dominance of the personal computer microprocessor
market.
Intel and its backers, meanwhile, are targeting Apple's existing market
share, aiming to take advantage of the uncertainties created by the
transition to PowerPC.
Apple, however, is not alone in its plans to offer PowerPC based personal
computers. IBM already offers a computer workstation based on the PowerPC
microprocessor. The company is expected to introduce a broad range of
'Power' machines for more general use, including portable PCs . But it is
not yet clear how IBM will position these products relative to its strong
Intel-based PC product line.
IBM is also actively seeking PowerPC endorsements from other computer
makers. The first, Canon of Japan, said recently that it will use PowerPC in
a new range of office computers and work with IBM and Motorola to develop
versions of PowerPC for use in hand-held and notebook-sized computers.
In Taiwan, PowerPC has attracted great interest among PC circuit-board
manufacturers. However, these sub-system manufacturers are unlikely to take
a leadership role in developing the PowerPC market. Instead, they tend to
wait for demand to develop in the US market.
'reference specifications' to PC manufacturers and software developers
interested in developing products around the new technology. Computers that
adhere to these specifications will eventually be able to run a smorgasbord
of operating systems and applications software, IBM says.
Microsoft has announced plans to port Windows NT to the PowerPC, and IBM's
new Workplace OS will run DOS, Windows, and OS/2 applications on the
PowerPC. PowerOpen, another 'multipersonality' operating environment, is
being developed specifically for PowerPC systems by Apple and IBM.
Together, IBM and Apple aim to establish a 30 percent share of the PC market
for PowerPC by the end of the decade, leaving Intel with perhaps 60 per cent
(the rest being clones of Intel microprocessors), down from about 80 percent
today.
Thus while PowerPC may somewhat diminish Intel's market share, not even its
most optimistic backers expect to overtake Intel's leadership in the
microprocessor market in the short term.
In the longer term, the outcome of the PowerPC versus Intel battle is likely
to depend as much on software developers as on the relative merits of each
type of microprocessor.

Floating down a Venetian canal or walking under the arched ceilings of a
medieval cathedral could all happen in the not-too-distant future without
the traveller leaving the armchair - see picture, right.
By holding a spaceball - that replaces the remote control pad - the armchair
traveller can explore the world through a virtual reality interface and
enhanced three-dimensional-type pictures on the home TV. This futuristic
tourism is just one of the TV-based home services being developed by BT
Laboratories at Martlesham Heath, near Ipswich in Suffolk.
Known as VRHS (for virtual reality home services), engineers are working on
a range of intuitive interfaces that could transform the way that TV is
viewed.

<TEXT>
Mirror Group Newspapers experienced exceptionally heavy turnover of 11m
shares as the market responded enthusiastically to the latest figures and
pushed the stock up 7 to 197p.
A lift in advertising revenues and trading margins, together with far better
than anticipated profits, saw forecasts raised to between Pounds 82m and
Pounds 85m for 1994. The only concern was the slide in circulation following
the price war started by News International.
The two English power generators, PowerGen and National Power, were among
the best performers in a generally strong utilities area following a strong
buy recommendation published by NatWest Securities.
The broker's strategic assessment of the two companies focused on the long
term attractions of both groups. Upgrading the stocks to a buy, NatWest
highlighted strong dividend growth, lack of regulatory threats and
recovering market share. PowerGen moved forward 13 to 552p and National
Power 12 1/2 to 463p.
North West Water, up 20 to 546p, Severn Trent, 15 better at 579p, and Wessex
Water, 15 higher at 671p, were the pick of the water stocks.
The placing of a block of 5.9m Vodafone shares at a discounted 564p by house
broker UBS, to finance the acquisition of a one-third stake in General
Mobile Communications from Generale des Eaux, of France, saw Vodafone dip 4
to 571p.
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi slipped a penny to 141p in spite of returning to
profitability. The market was disappointed by the group's margin growth. SG
Warburg reduced its 1994 profits forecast by 10 per cent to Pounds 30m.
An initial advance in electrical group Delta after the group revealed a
higher than expected dividend increase proved shortlived after brokers
downgraded current-year profits estimates.
Analysts were particularly concerned by the continuing pressure on profits
in the cable industry. The shares gave up 7 at 522p.
The list of brokers downgrading included Strauss Turnbull, which trimmed its
estimate by Pounds 4m to Pounds 59m. Several brokers advised investors to
switch out of Delta and into BICC, which appreciated 9 to 440p.
UK airports operator BAA closed 13 ahead at 1001p after a positive note on
the stock from NatWest Securities. The securities house, which expects 1994
profits of Pounds 324m, said: 'The company continues to produce traffic
growth marginally ahead of our expectations, giving us confidence in our
full-year profits forecasts.'
Analysts returned positive from pre-close season meetings with Granada,
helping the shares climb 6 to 561p amid profits forecast upgrades.
Euro Disney shares opened sharply down following the weakness seen after the
theme park group announced a financial rescue package on Monday. They later
rallied, ending the day 5 ahead at 395p.
Reports of a further round of price cuts in the milk market hurt Unigate and
Northern Foods, the shares slipping 3 to 348p and 2 to 218p respectively.
Tesco, off a penny at 223p, was said to be applying the renewed pressure on
suppliers, with expectations that other big operators Argyll, 3 ahead at
254p, and J. Sainsbury, 10 forward at 386p, are likely to follow suit. The
news follows weekend reports that Asda, up a penny at 60 1/2 p, was
pressuring suppliers to turn price promotions into permanent price
reductions.

FT  16 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Builders led by Wolseley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News that UK construction orders rose 16 per cent in the quarter ending on
January 31, plus stunningly good interim results from Wolseley, the UK's
leading builders merchant, saw the shares spearhead a general upsurge in the
building materials and merchants sector.
Wolseley's profits at Pounds 87m were around Pounds 17m higher than the most
optimistic forecasts in the market, while the 33 per cent rise in the
dividend compared with most expectations of an increase in the region of 10
per cent. BZW hoisted its current-year forecast for Wolseley from Pounds
153m to Pounds 187m and its 1995 estimate to Pounds 230m.
Mr Howard Seymour, building analyst at BZW, said Wolseley's 'phenomenally
good figures' confirmed the strong recovery coming through in the light end
of the building market.
Wolseley finished 73 higher at a record 975p. Since their elevation to FT-SE
100 status last June, Wolseley shares have climbed 46 per cent, compared
with a 12.3 per cent advance by the 100 index.
Wolseley's excellent results were followed by news of a near four-fold
profits increase from Heywood Williams, the building products group.
Marley is also expected to report bumper profits with its figures this
morning. A big line of Marley stock was taken out of the market last week,
prompting speculation that the figures would be much better than the market
expects. Most predictions for Marley point to pre-tax profits of Pounds
34m-plus.
Builders merchant Travis Perkins is expected to reveal more than doubled
pre-tax profits of some Pounds 20m tomorrow.
Marley rose 4 to 204p, Heywood Williams 7 to 437p, Graham Group, floated at
183p only a week ago, 8 to 214p, Meyer International 29 to 545p and Travis
Perkins 13 to 359p.
At the heavy end of the building materials sector, hopes of an early
reduction in German interest rates boosted Redland, up 9 at 571p, and RMC,
13 ahead at 972p.
Housebuilders, on the other hand, were unsettled by what was said to have
been a flat and uninspiring post-results meeting between George Wimpey and
construction sector analysts.
'We were expecting a bullish statement on housebuilding but got a rather
dismal appraisal,' said one analyst. Current-year profits estimates of up to
Pounds 50m were said to have been trimmed back to Pounds 45m and less in
some cases. Wimpey shares dropped to a low for the session of 206p following
the analysts meeting, before steadying to close a net 8 off at 210p.

FT  16 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Continuing hopes of a reduction in interest rates, and a firm performance in
bonds, helped stock index futures to a premium as the March contract pulled
the underlying cash market higher, writes Joel Kibazo.
The opening of the Liffe March contract on the FT-SE 100 at 3,227 was 6
points below the previous night's close, which initially led dealers to
expect a quiet session. But those early doubts soon faded, leaving March to
advance for most of the session, with 'solid US buying' said to have been
prominent in the first part of the day.
Having touched the day's high of 3,278, the contract finished at 3,272, up
39 from its previous close and at a 6-point premium to cash. Volume at the
official close was a healthy 16,480 contracts.
The Liffe Mid 250 March contract ended at 3,907 after business of 285 lots,
and June, which becomes the market leader next week, saw volume of 225
contracts. On the OMLX, the screens showed there had been no trade in the
FT-SE Mid 250 contract.
Turnover in Liffe traded options improved to 40,369 lots, with 21,792
contracts dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 2,043 in the Euro FT-SE option.
Ladbroke was the busiest stock option with a total of 2,309 trades.

FT  16 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Economic news fails to
prevent Dow fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US blue chip issues retreated yesterday in spite of a bond market rally and
more favourable news on the economy, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average blue chip indicator finished 13.39 off at
3,849.59, although the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 dipped just 0.38 to 467.01. In
the secondary markets, the American SE composite inched 0.07 ahead to 468.13
and the Nasdaq composite edged up 0.72 to 793.52.
New York SE volume totalled 329.3m shares, while advancing issues narrowly
led declines by 1,112 to 1,001.
After ignoring further weakness in the US Treasury market the previous
session, stocks were unmoved by yesterday's rebound by bonds. Equities, at
best, could only manage to struggle into positive territory during the
morning, aided by some solid numbers on industrial production, coupled with
a tame report on producer price inflation.
The Labor Department reported a 0.5 per cent increase in the February
producer price index, but the stronger than expected reading was largely
attributed to a jump in energy prices, due to harsh winter weather last
month. Excluding energy and food, producer prices were up only 0.1 per cent,
against a consensus forecast of 0.3 per cent.
The encouraging figure triggered heavy buying of the benchmark 30-year
government bond, which is especially sensitive to inflationary expectations.
Yields fell well below the worrisome 7.0 per cent level, giving some
breathing room to equity investors troubled by a swift rise in long-term
interest rates in recent weeks.
Still, enthusiasm was restrained, with most indices showing little movement
during the first half of the session. During the afternoon the blue chips
suffered a downturn which left market observers at a loss to explain.
Among the Dow industrials, Boeing fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 46 7/8 ,
United Technologies Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 68 and General Motors Dollars 1
1/4 to Dollars 61 3/8 . The other car makers also gave ground, with Ford
down Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 63 1/8 and Chrysler off Dollars  1/2 at
Dollars 59 1/4 . On a brighter note, AT&amp;T gained Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 52
3/8 and McDonald's rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 60 1/2 .
The star of the session was Kemper, which surged Dollars 20 7/8 , or nearly
50 per cent from its previous close, to Dollars 61 3/4 . The stock took off
in overnight trading on news that GE Capital had launched a Dollars 2.2bn
takeover bid for the financial services concern. The announcement came just
as Monday's session was drawing to an end.
The buying spilled over into other financial services companies. Equitable
was Dollars 1 3/4 higher at Dollars 24 3/8 , Sun America climbed Dollars 2
to Dollars 40 1/2 and Conseco added Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 58 5/8 .
In entertainment stocks, Capital Cities ABC forged ahead Dollars 11 3/4 to
Dollars 708 3/4 after announcing a proposed 10-for-one stock split. Time
Warner continued its impressive run, climbing Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 39
7/8 .
On the Nasdaq, Sun Microsystems put on Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 30 5/8 after
its new product line received good reviews from analysts, while Oracle shed
Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 34 1/8 .
Canada
Strong bonds and burgeoning economic confidence sent Toronto stocks to a
sharply higher close, defying the easier performance by Wall Street.
The TSE 300 composite index moved ahead 30.2 to 4,500.6 and rises led
declines by 465 to 339 after volume of 85.8m shares.
Twelve of the 14 sub-indices ended firmer, with energy up 1.0 per cent and
industrial products ahead 0.9 per cent.

FT  16 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Domestic component in bourse
revival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses found both domestic and international grounds for yesterday's gains,
writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS, up nearly 2 per cent, was little affected by the US PPI figures,
finding other and various reasons for the rise, including lingering hopes of
a Buba rate cut tomorrow, as well as support from the futures market.
The CAC-40 index closed 43.50 higher at 2,258.52.
There was strong activity among media stocks. Canal Plus, in particular, was
one of the session's most active performers, adding FFr54 or 6 per cent to
FFr1,050. It was suggested that the group was helped by reports that the
government was reviewing its request for a financial commitment towards the
development of a cable network.
Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, the construction group, up FFr8 at FFr592,
announced that its Dumez and GTM-Entrepose units would form a joint venture.
GTM dipped FFr28 or 5 per cent to FFr480. on the news.
Euro Disney, suspended limit down at one stage during the morning, recovered
to close the day up 85 centimes at FFr34.70.
FRANKFURT consolidated most of Monday afternoon's gains, the Dax index
showing a session rise of 20.42, and moved on again after hours with the
Ibis-indicated Dax closing at 2,178.91.
Brokers said that Monday afternoon's gains reflected Morgan Stanley's
raising of its recommended weighting in German equities. Turnover rose
again, from DM8.5bn to DM9.5bn.
Sentiment was lifted by Bayer which, unexpectedly, said that it would hold
the dividend at DM11. After a DM2.50 rise on the session the chemical group
rose another DM4.50 to DM380 after hours.
Relative strength continued in financials, in Siemens as it caught up with
other blue chips and in Volkswagen. But the most striking Dax stock gain was
in Schering: after an average response to Monday's progress report, the
pharmaceutical group put on DM37, or 3.6 per cent to DM1,073.
Mr Mark Tracey of Goldman Sachs said that there were six reasons for being
bullish about Schering: significant margin expansion in core
pharmaceuticals; Betaseron, the new multiple sclerosis drug; cost savings
potential; improvements in production techniques; strong cash flow; and
benefits from AgrEvo, the joint venture with Hoechst in agrochemicals.
AMSTERDAM firmed with strong interest seen in the heavily weighted issues,
DSM and Akzo Nobel, for example, adding a respective Fl 2.50 and Fl 2.80 to
Fl 124.40 and Fl 228.20.
The AEX index strengthened 3.37 to 427.27.
Hoogovens, which is expected to release 1993 results tomorrow that are
broadly expected to reveal another substantial loss, gained Fl 1.50 to Fl
68.70. Analysts expect the steel group to begin its return to profitable
operation in 1994, with the likelihood also that dividend payments will be
resumed.
Wolters Kluwer, the publisher, which satisfied investors with its 23 per
cent gain in 1993 profits, added Fl 1.50 to Fl 119.50.
ZURICH finished higher on the back of firmer US bonds, which rose after the
release of the US PPI figures. The SMI index rose 36.4 or 1.3 per cent to
2,906.9 but trading volume remained low.
Roche certificiates, the most active issue, put on SFr140 to SFr7,190.
SMH bearers slipped SFr20 to SFr880 amid doubts about further growth in the
watchmaker's market penetration, and the view that the Swatchmobile small
car project still had a long way to go.
Surveillance rose SFr70 to SFr2,110 after the inspection and verification
services group said that it expected its 1994 results to be in line with the
1993 outcome.
MILAN maintained its positive tone in spite of some selling ahead of today's
end of the monthly account. The Comit index added 4.28 to 678.06.
Demand from domestic funds and foreign investors helped some industrials and
blue chips higher. Fiat rose L33 to L4,998, Olivetti L55 to L2,510 and
Montedison L21 to L1,211.
Banco di Napoli fell L27 to L2,141 as Moody's, the US credit ratings agency,
said it had placed the bank's long-term credit ratings under review for
possible downgrade. The recently privatised banks remained firm: IMI rose
L27 to L12,640 and Credito Italiano put on L15 to L2,659. BCI added L125 to
L6,337, ahead of the first quotation tomorrow of its privatisation shares.
The new shares, sold by public offer at L5,400 without the L200 dividend,
were quoted on the London grey market yesterday at around L6,100.
MADRID gave credit to futures, foreign bourses and domestic bonds as the
general index rose 4.35 to 345.23 after a last minute spurt of buying.
Turnover rose to Pta32.14bn. There were specific interest rate hopes ahead
of tomorrow's Bundesbank meeting, and the interest-rate sensitive utilities
responded, showing the best gains of the day with Iberdrola, the most active
stock, Pta25 higher at Pta1,105.
TEL AVIV broke a four-session losing streak on buying by domestic pension
funds, the Mishtanim index shooting up by 13.2, or 6.75 per cent to 208.82.
This followed share price manipulation scandals which had dropped the blue
chip index by nearly 25 per cent from its 1994 high.

FT  16 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Region depressed by lack
of foreign interest

<TEXT>
Profit-taking following Monday's rally depressed share prices, and the
Nikkei 225 average finished marginally easier after moving within a narrow
range on technical trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index lost 17.30 at 20,508.85 after a day's high of 20,654.17 in the
morning and a low of 20,458.85 in the afternoon. Early buying by foreign
investors supported equities, but the Nikkei 225 was caught later between
profit-taking and arbitrage buying.
Traders were not discouraged by the falls because volume was heavy, with
some 550m shares changing hands, against Monday's 514m. A Japanese fund
manager said that while share prices still looked expensive on a
price/earnings ratio basis, the risk of a fall in values had declined,
helped by the fact that the economy seemed to have bottomed out. Rises
outpaced falls by 550 to 449, with 147 issues unchanged.
The Topix index of all first section stocks added 3.07 at 1,642.94 and the
Nikkei 300 gained 0.43 at 302.31. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed
3.75 to 1,363.71.
Machinery issues drew buying after the release of favourable data showing an
increase in industry orders. Minebea rose Y33 to Y748 and Nachi Fujikoshi Y9
to Y443.
The yen's retreat against the dollar supported high-technology issues. Sony
put on Y30 at Y6,330 and TDK Y50 at Y4,450. However, some issues which had
improved on the multimedia theme declined. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
dipped Y2,000 to Y952,000 and Fujitsu eased Y10 to Y1,040.
Mining issues, which had risen in tandem with the gold price, were lower.
Mitsui Mining and Smelting declined Y9 to Y416 and Sumitomo Metal Mining Y4
to Y928.
Banks rose on arbitrage buying, Industrial Bank of Japan firming Y10 to
Y3,290 and Sakura Bank Y60 to Y1,390.
In Osaka, the OSE average moved up 65.55 to 22,438.38 in volume of 172.7m
shares. Roundup
Weak turnover and declining share prices typified the region. Kuala Lumpur,
Jakarta and Karachi remained closed for holidays.
HONG KONG's turnover was down from HKDollars 3.9bn to a provisional
HKDollars 3.47bn, against figures of more than HKDollars 10bn in late-1993
when the market was booming. The Hang Seng index ended a net 116.51, or 1.2
per cent, down at 9,863.56 after an early 120-point gain.
US funds took profits and selling mainly hit blue chips, with Henderson Land
falling HKDollars 2.75 to HKDollars 47.75, Sun Hung Kai Properties HKDollars
1.50 to HKDollars 58.50 and Hutchison Whampoa HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars
32.25.
TAIWAN saw turnover shrink to its lowest this year, down from TDollars
40.39bn to TDollars 34.29bn, as the weighted index finished 59.63, or 1.1
per cent, weaker at 5,274.24, just one point above its 1994 low.
The heavily weighted financial sector was among the biggest losers, with
China Trust and China Development down TDollars 2 apiece to TDollars 63.50
and TDollars 119 respectively. It was said that reduced buying by foreign
institutions was hurting the market.
COLOMBO blamed foreign inactivity or selling, local institutional
profit-taking and a drive for liquidity in the retail market as the
all-share index dropped a further 31.92, or 2.5 per cent, to 1,268.38.
Turnover expanded from Rs116m to Rs142.8m.
BOMBAY edged up, but brokers said that trade was virtually paralysed by the
implementation of a ban by the Securities and Exchange Board of India on
forward trading. The BSE 30-share index rose 11.06 to 3,758.28.
The SEBI, India's main regulator for capital markets, had said that the
carry forward, or badla system of trading, was leading to excessive
speculation, and that it would allow resumption of the system only if stock
exchanges implemented several measures to make trading more transparent.
NEW ZEALAND defied the regional trend, the NZSE-40 index moving ahead 27.98
to 2,249.41 as the market found support from stronger European bourses and a
more stable local bond market.

FT  16 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Venezuelan equities are upset by tax
proposal - Transaction costs could rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new tax proposed last week by the Venezuelan government covering most
debit transactions at domestic banks has sent tremors through the Caracas
stock exchange.
On March 9, Mr Julio Sosa Rodriguez, Venezuela's minister of finance,
presented a series of tax bills to congress, including a proposed tax of
0.75 per cent on debit transactions at banks that will primarily affect the
country's private sector.
On the same day, the Caracas index reacted with a 4.3 per cent decline, and
over the week retreated more than 10 per cent in local currency terms.
The index recovered more than 3 per cent on Monday, but at midday yesterday,
prices were beginning to weaken once more. The market underperformed the
region last year, showing a 14 per cent gain in dollar terms, while turnover
slipped by 28 per cent compared with 1992.
Although equity investors in Venezuela were - and are - worried about a
number of problems, the proposed debit tax, as it is now being called, has
given them a new headache.
The tax, still to be approved by congress, has also raised fears that
trading will move offshore and that foreign investors will find the
country's equity market less attractive.
With some exceptions, banks will deduct the tax from the accounts of
individuals or companies whenever they order a debit to their accounts,
including issuing cheques or making an electronic payment.
A stock transaction requires at least four cheques or debit orders, each of
which would be taxed under the proposal. The new levy would increase
transaction costs significantly for domestic investors, and would have an
even greater effect on foreigners.
Ms Norys Aguirre, president of the stock exchange - the Bolsa de Valores de
Caracas - has asked the government to exclude exchange transactions from the
proposed levy. She warned that investors, especially from overseas, would be
driven away, noting that the tax would have theoretically added more than
Dollars 54m to last year's transaction costs.
Brokers and investors are also worried that stock deals will simply move
offshore in an effort to avoid the tax. Ms Aguirre pointed out that a
similar tax in Argentina was eliminated soon after it was applied when the
authorities realised that much of that stock exchange's activities had moved
to Uruguay; many Argentinians also decided to carry out their daily business
activities in cash rather than cheques.
The government has tried to soften the impact of the debit tax by noting
that it will only be in effect until December 31 and that, originally, a tax
of 2 per cent had been discussed.
The new tax is a sign of the desperate fiscal situation of President Rafael
Caldera's administration, which took office on February 2. It is trying to
cope with an economy in recession, a large fiscal deficit, high inflation,
declining income from oil exports (one of its main sources of Treasury
revenue), a banking crisis and other problems. It also hopes to raise
additional revenues through a proposed luxury tax and aims to reduce income
tax evasion.
Another tax initiative involves lifting the ceiling on corporate and
individual income tax from 30 per cent to 34 per cent. While this is not a
crippling increase, businessmen generally are unhappy as they work their way
through the second year of a recessionary economy.
The failure last January of Banco Latino, the country's second largest bank,
created an unexpected problem for the new government and provoked crises at
several other banks. The cash-strapped government has so far been forced to
supply Latino and other troubled banks with some Dollars 3bn in financial
assistance.
No-one can say for sure how the debt tax will fare in the new congress,
where the two political parties supporting Mr Caldera together hold under 25
per cent of seats in both the chamber of deputies and the senate.
The proposal got off to a bad start when Mr Henry Ramos, a spokesman for the
Democratic Action Party (AD), said the tax had never worked anywhere else.
Mr Caldera's parties need the support of one of the other three, larger
political blocs in congress in order to gain approval of the debit tax and
other tax proposals. So far, none of the three groups - AD, the Christian
Democrats or the left wing Radical Cause party - has indicated that it will
back the president.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Markets Report: Dollar steady on mixed data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Economic data released in the US yesterday revealed hints of inflation but
had little impact on the dollar, which has already factored in further
Federal Reserve tightening, writes Philip Gawith.
The US currency failed to make a sustained break through the key technical
level of DM1.6975 and finished in London at DM1.6963, up from DM1.6898 on
Monday.
Boosted by a fall in Japan's bilateral trade surplus with the US in
February, the dollar was also firmer against the yen, closing at Y106.150
from Y105.880. New York trading ended with the dollar at DM1.6960 and
Y106.05.
In Europe the recovery from recent interest rate pessimism continued, with
both sterling and Euromark futures rising across the yield curve. Market
speculation is that the Bundesbank will today announce a more generous cut
in its repo rate than the three basis points of the last two weeks.
The dollar weakened initially after the release of fairly modest inflation
data which appeared to postpone the need for higher US interest rates.
Although the headline figure showed February producer prices up by 0.5 per
cent, this fell to 0.1 per cent when the volatile food and energy sectors
were excluded. Cold weather in February pushed fuel bills to exceptional
levels.
The industrial production numbers released a little later, however, lent
support to the US currency. February industrial production rose 0.4 per
cent, against expectations of no change, while capacity use was 83.4 per
cent, against an 83 per cent forecast.
Mr David Cocker, currency analyst at Chemical Bank, said the capacity
utilisation measure had caused concern. 'We are almost at the level at which
in the past we have seen inflation pressure build in the US.'
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief currency strategist at Citibank, endorsed this
view, saying 'inflation pressures are bubbling below the surface' and that
there was nothing in the data to prevent the Fed from tightening if it
wishes.
Mr Cocker said the muted response of the dollar was explained by the market
already having factored in a rise in US interest rates. Mr MacKinnon said
the figures contained nothing new for dollar bulls. He predicted that the
dollar 'will find it very difficult to make progress against the D-Mark from
now on'.
Japan's February trade figures offered some solace for dollar bulls, showing
an unadjusted 0.9 per cent decline in the February surplus with the US from
a year earlier.
This positive note was promptly offset by comments from Mr Mickey Kantor,
the US trade representative, showing that the US would continue to play
tough over the trade talks. 'Our trade and economic relationship, a key
priority of the Clinton administration, is in serious disrepair,' he said.
The D-Mark was mixed in European trading ahead of today's repo announcement.
It was unchanged in London against the Belgian and French francs at BFr20.60
and FFr3.398 respectively. It was weaker against the Italian lira, at L985.4
from L988.1, and firmer against the Spanish peseta, finishing at Pta82.02
from Pta81.94.
Increased optimism about the pace of monetary easing was evident in the
Euromark futures. The June contract firmed four basis points to 94.60 and
the December contract 10 points to 95.06.
Analysts said German call money, in the 5.85 to 5.90 per cent range was also
helping, in that it indicated the market could accept a 6 to 7 basis-point
cut without difficulty.
Call money is now below the repo rate, which is 5.94 per cent. The
Bundesbank yesterday announced that it would be implementing another
variable rate repo.
Some observers were more aggressive in their forecasts, with Citibank's Mr
MacKinnon saying he 'would not be surprised' if the repo fell to 5.75 per
cent. 'The strength of the D-Mark gives the Bundesbank a chance to put
through quite a handsome repo cut.'
One factor likely to have a bearing on the size of the cut is the reportedly
easy liquidity position of the banks, which may have encouraged lower bids.
Sterling showed little reaction to the CBI's distributive trades survey
which showed a slow-down in retail sales growth. It eased slightly against
the dollar to Dollars 1.4915 from Dollars 1.4945, but was firmer against the
D-Mark, closing at DM2.53 from DM2.5254.
The CBI survey did have an impact in the futures market, with the June
sterling contract rising six basis points to 94.90 and the December contract
eight points to 94.60.
In the discount market the overnight rate maintained its firm tone of late,
trading around 6 per cent. Mr Philip Shaw, group economist at Union
Discount, said the Bank of England was continuing to have difficulty in
clearing the shortage. He said this reflected a shortage of bills rather
than pressure from the Bank.
Yesterday the Bank provided Pounds 550m of late assistance after earlier
putting Pounds 658m of liquidity into the system. This compared with a
revised forecast of a Pounds 1.25bn shortage.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Green' papermakers find
themselves out of pocket - Buyers are reluctant to pay adequate premiums for
the chlorine-free product
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The environmental movement has for years pressed pulp and paper mills to cut
their use of chlorine, which they claim is necessary to produce strong,
bright paper.
A growing number of producers, especially in Europe, have gone all the way.
Sensing a strong resistance among their customers to environmentally harmful
processes, some mills have spent heavily on processes that completely
eliminate chlorine as a bleaching agent in pulp and paper production.
Questions are now being raised, however, whether the producers have gone too
far. Evidence is mounting that customers are reluctant - at least for the
time being - to put their money where their mouths are.
Chlorine-free papers are not commanding the premium prices producers
expected, and which are required to recoup their sizeable investments in a
pioneering technology.
Doubts about the market's willingness to pay for the ultimate in
environmentally friendly paper are especially evident in North America,
where the vast majority of producers is strongly resisting pressures to move
towards the elimination of chlorine from pulp-making processes.
Mr Matthew van Hook, vice-president of the American Forest and Paper
Association's pulp group, told the AFPA's annual meeting last week that 'the
jury is still out on the environmental impacts of totally chlorine-free
(TCF) processes themselves, not to mention their technological and economic
feasibility'.
Chlorine owes its popularity as a bleaching agent to its ability to remove
unwanted resins and fatty acids from wood pulp while leaving intact the
cellulose fibres required for paper-making.
But chlorine is also a heavy polluter, adding toxic by-products such as
dioxins and chlorinated organic compounds, known as AOXs, to pulp mill
effluent.
It has increasingly been supplanted as a bleaching agent by hydrogen
peroxide, supplemented in some cases by an ozone-bleaching process and by
enzymes.
Chlorine-free pulp is especially popular in Germany, where the environmental
crusade against the forestry industry is strongest.
Germany, Switzerland and Austria consumed almost 1.9m tonnes of totally
chlorine-free (TCF) pulp last year out of total European demand of about
3.1m tonnes. Jaakko Poyry, the Finnish forest-products consultancy, predicts
that European demand will jump to between 5m and 6m tonnes by the end of the
decade.
For the present however, supply exceeds demand. Prices for northern bleached
softwood kraft pulp, the industry staple, are currently around Dollars 450 a
tonne.
Mr Martin Granholm, president of Kymmene, the Finnish forest-products group,
says that the present premium for TCF pulp is only about 10 to 15 per cent,
which is well below the figure of some Dollars 130 a tonne that forestry
companies say they require to reimburse the extra expense of installing
non-chlorine bleaching equipment.
In a speech at last week's AFPA meeting, Mr Granholm said it was 'quite
probable that some over-capacity will be created in Europe for TCF pulps.
This is predicted to lower the price premium that TCF pulps have had'.
Only one mill in North America, a 700-tonnes-a-day facility in California
operated by Louisiana-Pacific, at present produces totally chlorine-free
pulp. One-fifth of its 1993 output was chlorine-free, and it is scheduled to
be in continuous TCF production by September 1995.
The mill's environmental benefits are undeniable. Its effluent has a hazy,
pale yellow tint, compared to the coffee-coloured waste spewed out by mills
using chlorine. The levels of toxic AOX and dioxins are so small as to be
virtually unmeasurable.
But Louisiana-Pacific is far from recouping its investment of about Dollars
100m. Weak demand forced the mill to close during the last few months of
1993. It reopened in January and produced TCF pulp for just over a month
before being shut down again on March 2. The company has yet to decide when
it will restart.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazil seeks markets for orange
juice - US imports are expected to fall further
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil, the world's biggest exporter of frozen concentrated orange juice
with a commanding 86 per cent share of the international market, will need
to step up its sales efforts in Europe and Asia to compensate for further
declines expected in exports to the US.
Mr Rogerio Braga, president of Cambuhy Citrus, one of Brazil's largest
orange-processing companies, believes that the country's share of the US
market is likely to fall to between 5 and 10 per cent by the end of the
1990s, partly as a result of the recently agreed North American Free Trade
Agreement. This compares with the heyday of Brazilian exports to the US in
the 1970s, when 60 per cent of Brazil's total production of frozen
concentrated orange juice was sold in North America.
'Florida and Mexico, which has been granted special tariff conditions under
Nafta, will certainly be able to supply almost all of North America's
demand,' he told an international fruit conference last week in Rotterdam.
Speakers at the conference, which was organised by the port of Rotterdam and
Rabobank, the Dutch bank that specialises in agri-business, said that the
world's fruit sector also faced challenges caused by changes in the way
fruit and fruit juices were marketed. Increasingly, fruit growers and food
retailers were attempting to eliminate 'middlemen' such as brokers, import
agents, packers and wholesalers.
Mr Braga said the decline in orange juice sales to the North American market
over the past few decades was probably irreversible, meaning that Brazil
would have to concentrate on Europe, already its biggest market, and on new
markets in Asia such as Korea.
In spite of sharp increases in exports to Europe, there was room for further
growth, he said, because consumption of fruit juice was barely half the US
figure of 29 litres a person a year. In some countries, such as France,
Italy and Spain, consumption is still in single digits.
Consumption in Asia is low in absolute terms but rising rapidly.
'It took us 15 years to see Europeans consuming orange juice at half the
levels of Americans,' Mr Braga said. 'We might be able to get south-east
Asia to that level in half that time.'
Besides shifts in trade flows, Brazil and other fruit producers are
grappling with the shake-up in traditional relations between food retailers
and food suppliers.
The rise of discount chains and 'own label' products in established
supermarkets has affected every link of the chain, from growers to packers.
'Retailers are cutting their fat and have put tremendous pressure on the
food processing industry,' Mr Braga explained.
At the Netherlands' largest supermarket chain, Albert Heijn, the trend was
towards concluding partnerships directly with growers of fruits and
vegetables, said Mr Krijn Dorsman, executive vice-president of
merchandising. 'There are too many links in the chain between supplier and
consumer,' he said, noting that every link pushes up the retail price of
food.
The Dutch supermarket group has therefore moved towards a policy of working
with one exclusive partner for every product or product group in the fruit
and vegetable sector. This partner undertakes to provide sufficient supplies
to cover the supermarket chains' needs.
Mr Fred Hofman, a board member of the Bremen-based Atlanta Group, one of
Germany's biggest fruit importers, told the conference he believed that
importers and brokers would continue to have a role to play.
He added, however, that they would need to concentrate more on providing
services, such as quality control and the arranging of
'environmental-friendly' transport and packaging.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Europe's farmers face stark
choice over production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European farmers face a stark choice before the end of the decade between
tighter restraints on the use of land and chemicals or the complete
abolition of price support.
This is believed to be the central message of a detailed strategy document
to be considered today by the council of the National Farmers' Union of
England and Wales.
The NFU's long-term strategy group, which produced the report, believes the
recent Gatt deal will lead to another shake-up of the Common Agricultural
Policy before 2000.
'Current CAP policies are not going to increase consumption or bring down
the production of cereals and beef sufficiently to allow the EU to meet its
obligations under the Gatt settlement,' it says. 'EU farmers are approaching
a fundamental policy choice.'
This runs counter to assurances from the European Commission and the UK
government that no further fundamental change will be needed in sectors
subject to current CAP reforms to comply with EU commitments under the Gatt
deal.
The report is understood to rule out the option of exit bonds, under which
current agricultural support systems would end overnight and farmers would
be compensated with a fixed, finite payment, which would be tradeable.
The strategy group says this could push up the EU's annual spending on
agriculture - currently Ecu29bn - by 60-70 per cent in the short term and
would be politically unacceptable because it would lead to high rural
unemployment.
It also dismisses the extension of output quotas - such as those on milk -
to new sectors, saying this would be complicated to administer and would
conflict with the general reduction in government intervention in industry.
The choice, therefore, would be between tighter controls on inputs - for
example, by increasing the amount of set-aside land or reducing the amount
of nitrogen used - or abolishing the link between support payments to
farmers and their production levels.
Farm incomes would be better protected under a system of input controls,
assuming these would continue to be accompanied by subsidised exports and
import tariffs. 'But they may not be sustainable (beyond the 1990s) if
future Gatt rounds force lower levels of border protection and export
subsidies,' says the report.
The decoupling option would expose EU farmers to competition with world
prices, putting the full burden of support payments on the taxpayer. The
report suggests EU cereal prices could fall by a further 30 per cent before
reaching world price levels and that this might entail an unacceptably high
level of compensation.
The NFU plans to consult its 100,000 members, as well as the government, the
wider agricultural industry, and other European farming groups, in the
difficult task of achieving a consensus on future strategy.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Malaysian rubber and tin output
decline further

Malaysia's declining role as a commodity producer is highlighted by
statistics released here on 1993 rubber and tin production - two commodities
in which, until fairly recently, Malaysia led the world.
The Malaysian department of statistics says the country's total natural
rubber production in 1993 was 1.07m tonnes, a drop of 98,000 tonnes, or 8
per cent, from the 1992 figure. Within that smallholder output declined 7
per cent while estate production dropped 12 per cent.
Exports of natural rubber also dropped - by 9 per cent to 937,000 tonnes.
The decline in tin-in-concentrates production was sharper, by 28 per cent to
10,384 tonnes in 1993.
Malaysia's is industrialising fast and commodities are playing a decreasing
role in the overall economy. Serious labour shortages and low prices are
also forcing people to abandon labour intensive agricultural activities.
A surge in car sales in the US is being seen as the main reason for a rally
in natural rubber prices which, after several months in the doldrums,
reached a five-year high on far eastern markets last week. Traders say tight
supply due to prolonged monsoon rains in rubber producing areas has also
helped prices.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Government Bonds: German rate hopes spur big gains across
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European government bonds put on another strong performance yesterday,
boosted by hopes of a more rapid easing in German interest rates.
Firmer US Treasuries lent added support, although they underperformed their
European counterparts, Mr Ifty Islam, an economist at Merrill Lynch said.
The yield gap between the higher-yielding US 10-year benchmark and its
German counterpart widened to 39 basis points, from 30 basis points on
Monday and 24 on Friday.
Retail activity remained subdued, with investors awaiting today's allocation
of the Bundesbank's securities repurchase agreements, UK retail sales and
employment numbers, and US consumer price data.
However, some traders reported substantial buying of German, French and
Dutch bonds by US hedge funds.
Hopes for accelerated Bundesbank easing gave German bunds a strong boost,
with 10-year maturities gaining more than a point.
Looking to the Bundesbank's repo allocation, most dealers are calling for a
slightly larger drop in the minimum repo rate than the three-basis-point
declines of the last two weeks.
Most traders are betting on a reduction of between five and seven basis
points, with some calling for a 10-basis point ease.
The market was also abuzz with speculation over Thursday's Bundesbank
council meeting. As it is the last meeting before the central bank's Easter
break, there was some talk that it might announce fixed-rate repos at lower
rates for the following weeks. The next council meeting is scheduled for
April 14.
UK gilts also gained more than a point, boosted by strong bond markets
elsewhere and the latest Confederation of British Industry survey
in-dicating that UK retail sales slowed in February from January. Full sales
data will be released today, along with key employment numbers.
Meanwhile, traders expect the Bank of England to announce its next gilt
auction on Friday. Most are looking for an issue of medium-dated paper,
possibly the 6 per cent gilts due 1999. The June long gilt future rose 1 3/8
point to 113.
Italian bonds put on the strongest performance of the day, helped by the
successful five-year bond auction and short-covering in the futures market.
The June BTP future jumped 1.62 point to 112.17.
However, according to Mr Andre de Souza, market strategist at PaineWebber,
the rally 'was not investor-driven - it was more of a catch-up,' retracing
the losses of the recent global sell-off, when Europe's high-yielders
suffered most.
Japanese bonds weakened in Tokyo, pressured by a lacklustre two-year auction
and worries of further supply. However, they steadied in London trading. The
June JBG future dropped 0.68 point to 110.22 in Tokyo, but slipped only 0.02
point in London.
US Treasuries took some comfort from a keenly-awaited report on producer
prices. However, the positive sentiment was tempered by concern over
stronger-than-expected industrial production in February.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was ahead at 91
29/32 , with the yield slipping to 6.89 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was  1/32 better at 99 3/8 , to yield 4.946 per cent.
Despite the gloomy mood of recent weeks, traders were able to look past a
disconcerting headline figure in the Labor Department's producer price
report. The overall index showed a 0.5 per cent increase, a little worse
than analysts had forecast, but most of that gain was attributed to a
weather-related 2.8 per cent jump in energy prices. The core PPI, excluding
energy and food, showed a tame 0.1 per cent rise, against expectations of
0.3 per cent.
Prices across the yield curve improved on the news, but slipped a little
after the government reported that industrial production had climbed 0.4 per
cent last month, twice what the experts predicted.
Nevertheless the market, considered by many analysts to have over-reacted to
the bearish economic fundamentals recently, quickly regained its stride.
Bond prices were close to their session highs late in the day, with added
support from an afternoon purchase of securities by the Federal Reserve. The
move, known as a coupon pass, carried no policy implications.

FT  16 MAR 94 / International Bonds: Rarity value helps launch New Zealand's
FRN deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New Zealand's rarity value in the international bond market, combined with
the likelihood that Moody's is about to raise the country's credit rating,
ensured a favourable reception for its widely-expected Dollars 1bn offering
of five-year floating-rate notes (FRNs) launched yesterday.
Mr Alex Jurshevski, head of portfolio management at New Zealand's debt
management office, said the proceeds of the transaction would be used to
refinance maturing debt, and would allow the sovereign borrower to call
outstanding floating-rate debt.
He said New Zealand planned to call its Dollars 250m FRN offering due 1996
next week, and that it had already called an old issue of
sterling-denominated FRNs, worth the equivalent of Dollars 200m.
Mr Jurshevski said although New Zealand actively used its Dollars 3bn Euro
medium-term note programme, the government's intention to reduce the
country's NZDollars 66.7bn foreign debt meant it would be depend even less
on the Eurobond market for its funding in the future.
Mr John Orange, senior portfolio manager at the New Zealand debt management
office, said the government's strategy reflected its desire to reduce the
risk associated with foreign currency borrowing and its success in
developing New Zealand's domestic bond market.
Joint lead managers Morgan Stanley and UBS said around 80 per cent of the
notes had been sold by late afternoon. In eastern Asia, central banks and
government agencies were strong buyers of the notes, attracted by their zero
risk weighting for capital adequacy purposes.
Sales into Japan were limited, possibly reflecting a reluctance among
investors to take on new commitments ahead of the close of the financial
year at the end of this month. European sales were mainly to funds in
Switzerland, Germany, the UK and Italy.
The coupon on the notes, of three-month Libor less  1/8 , was in line with
market expectations. When the notes were freed to trade, they were bid at
the issue price of 99.78.
Hydro-Quebec is expected to launch a Dollars 500m offering of five-year
notes today, via CS First Boston. The notes are likely to yield around 15 to
18 basis points over Libor.
Pemex, the Mexican oil company, raised Dollars 400m in the FRN market in two
three-year transactions as part of a refinancing of a Dollars 1.5bn bank
facility. One transaction was structured as a 'volatility floater', which
offered investors the chance to improve their yield.
Standard &amp; Poor's has raised its ratings on Citicorp and units and removed
them from credit watch. S&amp;P said the action reflected the progress the
company has made in improving its financial strength. S&amp;P raised the senior
debt rating to A from A minus, and the subordinated debt rating to A minus
from triple B plus.
Moody's has placed the long-term ratings of Italy's seventh-largest banking
group, Banco di Napoli, under review for possible downgrading.
It said Italy's continuing recession made the bank vulnerable to further
impairment of its asset quality. Banco di Napoli's long-term ratings are A2
for senior bank deposits and A3 for subordinated bank deposits and
subordinated debt.

FT  16 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: Regulatory pact marks new era
in derivatives trade - The UK-US agreement comes at a vital time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's news of a pact to co-ordinate regulatory overseeing of
over-the-counter derivatives trading in the US and UK came as two of the
world's most influential groups of traders prepared to open annual meetings
in the US.
The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) opens it meeting
in Chicago today, while international derivatives regulators, and
representatives of the exchange-traded derivatives community are meeting in
Boca Raton, Florida.
Both organisations have put regulatory issues and international co-operation
at the top of their agendas. Although the two groups see themselves as
distinct and often at odds in competing for the world's risk-management
business, yesterday's regulatory announcement shows that the borders between
the two groups have blurred considerably.
The future, and the sustained growth of global derivatives trading - on and
off listed exchanges - hinges on the regulatory decisions of a variety of
countries. International bank regulators are busy formulating capital
adequacy requirements, disclosure rules, and special accounting that
includes transaction netting.
With their agreement, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the UK's
Securities and Investment Board, and the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission have demonstrated they want to join the bank regulators'
discussion, and have put the over-the-counter swaps dealers on notice that
they (the regulators) must be reckoned with.
For the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which is facing
reauthorisation this year, its co-operative efforts with the SEC and the SIB
may help head off Congressional criticism of its handling of exemptions for
certain energy derivatives. Added to this is the fact that it has, at times,
seemed ill-prepared to deal with a truly global futures and derivatives
crisis.
After four years of fractious debate, Congress gave the CFTC limited
overseeing of OTC derivatives in 1992, and promised to revisit their
regulatory treatment this year. The CFTC's initiative with the SEC may give
legislators, who have grown to understand the value of derivatives, more
confidence in the agency.
Taken unawares by the securities regulators' initiative, ISDA leaders had
been bracing this week for the release of another regulatory study on the
derivatives business.
Washington's General Accounting Office is overdue to release an extensive
examination on the industry. The GAO is known for its tough and
controversial reports, and is not expected to soft-hand derivatives dealings
like reports by industry groups such as the Group of Thirty.
After a year of such reports, and much discussion by legislators and bank
regulators, the SIB-SEC-CFTC pact smacks of action and provides an agenda
for co-operation on global OTC derivatives regulation.

<TEXT>
Aldus and Adobe Systems, the pioneers of desktop publishing software, are to
merge. They will form a half billion dollar company that will address a
broad range of electronic publishing applications.
Adobe will exchange 1.15 shares of its common stock for each share of Aldus
common stock. At current prices the transaction is valued at approximately
Dollars 525m.
'We are committed to achieving the cost savings necessary to make this
transaction non-dilutive in the first full year of the combined operations,'
said Mr John Warnock, chairman and chief executive of Adobe Systems.
'We believe our two companies, each with a rich history of inventing
different aspects of the electronic publishing revolution, are simply much
stronger together - both technologically and financially - than we would be
by remaining separate,' said Mr Warnock.
Adobe and Aldus are widely recognised for having created desktop printing
and electronic publishing, which has grown into a Dollars 2bn industry since
the early 1980s.
On a combined basis, the companies had revenues last year of Dollars 520m
and more than 2,100 employees. For fiscal 1993, Adobe reported revenues of
Dollars 313m and net income of Dollars 57m, while Aldus reported total
revenues of about Dollars 207m and net income of Dollars 9.5m.

NKK, the Japanese steel company, plans a wide-ranging restructuring aimed at
reducing employees by a further 1,300 and increasing profits by Y175bn
(Dollars 1.65bn) over the next three years.
The company, which faces heavy losses this year, says the restructuring is
intended to return the company to profit so that it can resume dividends by
1995-96.
Earlier this month, it revised its earnings estimate for the year ending
this month and said that it expects pre-tax losses of Y25bn.
Under the plan, NKK will cut capital spending to a third of levels seen over
the past three years, or about Y140bn.
The latest job cuts are in addition to 3,200 announced last year.

FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: Chinese group powers on with HK
float - Simon Holberton visits Dongfang, a leading maker of power generation
equipment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It takes nearly two and a half hours to travel the 59 kilometres from
Chengdu, the provincial capital of Sichuan in China's south-west, to Deyang,
the home of Dongfang Electrical Machinery.
Through a landscape undergoing a familiar transformation from agriculture to
industry, the journey is enlivened by the anarchic quality of motoring in
modern China. But it is one which the managers of Dongfang, China's third
largest maker of power generation equipment, hope will not deter investors.
The company expects to be floated on the Hong Kong stock exchange next month
 -the eighth of the first nine companies which the Chinese government
nominated last year for listing outside China - with an issue of about 125m
'H' shares.
Nomura, the Japanese securities house which is the lead manager, estimates
that this offering to foreign investors, which is equal to 25 per cent of
Dongfang's capital, will raise about HKDollars 350m (USDollars 45m). A
slightly smaller percentage of the company will be issued in the form of 'A'
shares to mainland Chinese investors and listed on the Shanghai stock
exchange.
In the Hong Kong stock broker jargon, Dongfang is an 'infrastructure play',
a 'warrant' on the fast-growing Chinese economy. The company appears well
positioned. According to Dongfang, it has a 40 per cent share of the Chinese
market for hydroelectric power generating equipment and a 25 per cent share
of the country's steam turbine generator market.
Overall it has a share of 30 per cent of the Chinese power engineering
market - a market which still has plenty of room to mature. Electrification
touches only 67 per cent of households in China, compared with 80 per cent
in Thailand and 82 per cent in India.
Moreover, if China is to sustain economic growth rates of around 10 per cent
a year it desperately needs more electric power plants. On current trends,
demand for electric power is set to double between now and 2000. According
to Mr Jacky Chiu, an analyst at Nomura Research Institute, this means adding
an extra 20,000MW of generating each year. But the gap between China's need
and its capacity to meet that need is large. The production capacity of the
three mainland manufacturers is only 10,000MW to 12,000MW a year.
'As the Chinese government has designated that most of the annual
requirement for power generation capacity should be satisfied locally, local
manufacturers have to increase substantially both production capacity and
technological levels in the next few years,' Mr Chiu wrote recently.
Underlining the need for rapid development of the power industry is the
decision of the Chinese government to offer foreign investors stakes in
other power companies. Recently 22 companies were nominated for foreign
(mostly Hong Kong) listings and among them is Harbin Power Plant Equipment
Group, China's biggest manufacturer of power generating equipment, as well
as four power supply companies.
Dongfang's managers say that increasing productive capacity and raising the
company's technological sophistication are the main benefits they see coming
from the listing in Hong Kong.
According to Mr Chen Weijian, general manager, Dongfang plans to invest
Yn920m (Dollars 105m) over the next three years in increasing the capacity
of Dongfang's works.
Of this, the lion's share (Yn670m) will go to upgrade its technology in
hydro power production. By 1997 it wants to increase production capacity of
its hydro generators to 1,600MW from 600MW. A smaller amount (Yn250m) will
be allocated to increase the production of steam turbine generators with
capacities of 300MW and 600MW.
Dongfang needs an infusion of capital for expansion. Its order book is full
until the end of 1996. Not only that but by that time China's biggest
hydroelectric development - the Three Gorges project on the Yangtze river -
is expected to be well under way.
When completed the Three Gorges will be the world's largest lake and
hydroelectric power system. In its first phase the project will consist of
26 700WM units. Although Dongfang will be just one of the suppliers to the
project company executives expect the Three Gorges to underwrite its future
for many years to come.
In pursuit of technology, the company is exploring joint venture
possibilities with European and North American power generation equipment
manufacturers. Dongfang is holding preliminary discussions with GE Canada
about a joint venture in hydroelectric power, and it recently signed a draft
memorandum of understanding with Siemens.
This gives the German manufacturer 51 per cent of a steam turbine assembly
and test factory. Siemens will put up DM26m for its share of the business
while Dongfang will provide the land and erect the factory. Executives
expect the joint venture to be operational in 1995.
As Mr Rao Fangquan, a deputy general manager, observed: 'The most important
aspect of a joint venture is not the capital but the technology, so our
company can develop.'

FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: Ball bearing makers agree supply
deals
</HEADLINE>

   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Minebea of Japan and FAG Kugelfischer of Germany, the two ball bearing
manufacturers recently hit by heavy losses, are to supply each other with
bearings in order to reduce their investment and production costs.
Under the agreements - signed in Thailand, where Minebea has its largest
factory - Minebea will supply FAG with miniature and small ball bearings,
while FAG will supply Minebea with small and medium-sized bearings.
The two companies will also swap technical knowhow.
They said they would notify the European Commission of the deal to obtain
clearance under the European Union's competition rules.
Executives from Minebea, which is particularly strong in Asia, and FAG, with
its European base, said each company would continue to market products
separately using its own brands.
'Each company will benefit from the manufacturing strengths of the other,'
said Mr Goro Ogino, Minebea president, in a statement, 'and both companies
will be able to realise important cost savings at the capital investment and
manufacturing level'.
Mr Peter-Juergen Kreher, chairman of FAG's management board, said: 'Today's
agreements represent a vital opportunity for us both to ensure our ability
to deliver a wider range of ball bearing products at the lowest possible
cost.'
According to the deal, Minebea will supply bearings with an outer diameter
of up to 24mm, while FAG will supply those with diameters between 24 and
35mm.
Both companies have undergone extensive restructuring. Minebea's net loss
was Y61.21bn (Dollars 578m)in the year to September 30, 1993, while FAG
reported a net loss of DM439m (Dollars 260m) in 1992.

Santos, the Adelaide-based oil and gas company, reports a near doubling of
after-tax profits to ADollars 219.3m (USDollars 157.5m) for 1993. In the
previous year, profit after abnormals was ADollars 112.7m.
In part, the sharp improvement was due to a turnround on abnormals. In 1993,
Santos booked a net gain of ADollars 34.9m, reflecting a ADollars 46.6m
surplus on the sale of the company's shares in Sagasco, which was taken over
by Boral last year, a ADollars 44.1m gain from tax-related matters, and a
ADollars 55.8m write-down of capitalisation exploration expenditure. In the
previous year, there was a ADollars 49.9m abnormal charge.
Santos also benefited from lower tax and interest charges, with the latter
falling to ADollars 38.2m from ADollars 50.3m. Earnings before interest and
tax in 1993 stood at ADollars 327.4m, marginally below 1992's ADollars
322.2m.

FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: Banks warn of Haka exposure

<TEXT>
Three leading Finnish banks, struggling to recover from the country's
financial crisis, warned yesterday that they faced further big credit losses
after the Haka construction group filed for bankruptcy.
Unitas, the country's second largest banking group, said the collapse could
produce write-offs of up to FM450m (Dollars 81.89m), but it stressed that
this did not alter its forecast of a substantially reduced deficit in 1994.
It said its total exposure to Haka amounted to around FM1.2bn.
Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, Finland's largest bank, said it would suffer a loss
of no more than FM200m from the bankruptcy. It added that the amount would
be covered by a FM900m provision, taken last year, for unidentified bad
loans. Its claims on Haka companies total FM815m.
A third bank, Postipankki, estimated potential credit losses at FM300m,
although its total exposure amounts to just over FM800m. It said the nominal
value of its collateral was more than FM750m.
'The final credit and guarantee losses are dependent upon both the
successful liquidation of the collateral as well as the orderly completion
of on-going projects,' Postipankki stated.
Rautaruukki, the Finnish state-controlled steel group, yesterday unveiled a
FM144m profit after financial items for 1993, a sharp turnround on the
FM697m loss reported for the previous year.
It benefited from firmer steel prices, cost-cutting and the weaker Finnish
markka. But the result was held back by high financing costs, lower demand
in western Europe, and continued losses at the company's Transtech rolling
stock unit. The group said it would not pay a dividend for the third
consecutive year.
Operating profits after depreciation were FM829m, or 11.8 per cent of sales
of FM7.01bn. This compares with profits of FM454m on turnover of FM6.50bn a
year earlier.

FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: NKK to cut 1,300 more jobs in
restructure

<TEXT>
NKK, the Japanese steel company, plans a wide-ranging restructuring aimed at
reducing employees by a further 1,300 and increasing profits by Y175bn
(Dollars 1.65bn) over the next three years.
The company, which faces heavy losses this year, says the restructuring is
intended to return the company to profit so that it can resume dividends by
1995-96.
Earlier this month, the company revised its earnings estimate for the year
ending this month and said that it expects pre-tax losses of Y25bn.
The company is being forced to pass its dividend for the first time since it
was stock market listed in 1949.
Mr Shunkichi Miyoshi, president, said NKK aimed to increase its ratio of
profits to sales in the engineering division to 5 per cent from the current
3 per cent.
Under the plan, NKK will cut capital spending to a third of levels seen over
the past three years, or about Y140bn.
Steelmaking operations will be streamlined by reducing the product range,
integrating production of some products at one plant and shifting production
of other products to an affiliated electric furnace steel maker.
The latest plan brings the total number of employee cuts to 4,500. Last
year, NKK said it would reduce employee numbers by 3,200 by fiscal 1995.
Reductions would be achieved through transfers to subsidiaries, cuts in
graduate employees and natural attrition.
NKK expects to continue its operations in electronics and property
development which are two areas the company has been working in.
It also hopes to increase its involvement in south-east Asia where it is
considering local production of steel or joint ventures depending on the
needs of each particular country.
The restructuring plan is not expected to affect National Steel, the US
company in which NKK has a 50 per cent equity stake.
National Steel itself is beginning to enjoy the fruits of its own
restructuring, Mr Miyoshi said, and NKK hopes to support the running of
National Steel by its US management.

R. H. Macy, the New York-based retailer operating under Chapter 11 of the US
bankruptcy code, recorded a further recovery in earnings in its second
quarter as cost-cutting took effect.
While sales during the period ending January 29 slipped Dollars 40m from a
year before, to just under Dollars 2bn, Macy's lifted net income to Dollars
60.5m, from Dollars 8.9m. Selling and other overhead costs were Dollars 68m
lower than a year before.
Cashflow, though still well below levels seen in the late 1980s, also
continued to show a recovery. Earnings before interest, tax and depreciation
in the quarter were Dollars 227m, up from Dollars 141m.

Nike, the US athletic footwear and apparel marketer, yesterday posted a
sharp downturn in revenues and earnings for its third fiscal quarter.
The poor performance reflected lagging US sales of its mainstay line of
basketball shoes, which have fallen out of fashion with young people over
the past year.
Net income in the three months to the end of February amounted to Dollars
63.2m, or 85 cents a share, well below last year's Dollars 89.4m, or Dollars
1.16.
Revenues dropped 10 per cent to Dollars 871.8m, against Dollars 972m last
time. In the US, sales were down 14 per cent at Dollars 562m. International
revenues dipped 2 per cent to Dollars 260m, but would have shown a 4 per
cent improvement if the effect of currency fluctuations were excluded.

FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: CTC shares suspended after move
on tariffs

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in CTC, the Chilean telecommunications group, were suspended in New
York and Santiago yesterday after Chilean regulatory authorities recommended
sharp cuts in fixed-rate telephone tariffs.
In New York, where CTC trades a quarter of its stock via American Depository
Receipts (ADRs), it fell 15.75 to 100.5, while in Santiago shares were down
8.32 per cent to 2,700 pesos.
Trading in Santiago was suspended for two days and halted in New York
pending news from the company.
CTC said it had lodged a complaint with the General Comptroller and would
seek to have the five-year tariff cuts declared illegal. Mr Claudio Garcia,
chief financial officer of CTC, said: 'We feel that we have a good chance to
correct the decree and that the government will correct some of these basic
errors.'
Tariff proposals submitted by the ministry of transport and
telecommunications would have a 'negative impact on its 1994-1998 business
plan', he said.
Potential loss of income to CTC from the proposed tariff structure is
calculated at Dollars 50m by Salomon Brothers, which downgraded the stock
from a buy to a hold. Salomon analyst Mr Alfredo Viegas said: 'CTC had been
expecting a slight increase; instead the government decreed sharp 30-40 per
cent decreases.'
Mr Viegas expected the impact on CTC's 1994 results to be 'large and
negative', predicting flat profits of around Dollars 240m instead of the
hoped-for 18 per cent growth.

FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: IBM chief expects a gradual
recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Lou Gerstner, chairman and chief executive of International Business
Machines, sees no quick fix for the computer company's financial woes. In
the annual report to shareholders, Mr Gerstner says that IBM will recover
'over time'.
'It won't all happen overnight, but we are making significant progress,' Mr
Gerstner says in a letter addressed to 'Dear Fellow Investor'. He
acknowledges, however, that 'you wouldn't know it from looking at the
financial results for the year (1993).'
IBM earlier reported net losses for 1993 of Dollars 8.1bn on revenues of
Dollars 62.7bn. In 1992 the company recorded a Dollars 5bn loss on sales of
Dollars 64.5bn.
Mr Gerstner charges that the company 'failed to keep pace with significant
change in the industry'. It 'has been too bureaucratic and too preoccupied
with our own view of the world. We have been way too slow getting new things
to the market,' he states.
'We believe we can fix these problems because they are caused by us and not
factors outside our doors,' says Mr Gerstner, directly contradicting past
statements by senior IBM managers who blamed IBM's problems on economic
pressures and market turmoil.
Mr Gerstner, who last July stated that 'the last thing IBM needs right now
is a vision,' now believes that 'strategy is particularly important for
IBM'. He is expected to begin to reveal those strategies at an analysts
meeting later this month.
IBM's plans, announced last July, to reduce its workforce by 35,000 by the
end of 1995, are unchanged. 'Based on current business conditions, we think
that's about the right number,' Mr Gerstner says.
Financial data revealed for the first time in the annual report point to
IBM's mainframe computers as the crux of its problems. Revenue from
mainframe computer hardware declined 27.6 per cent last year, to Dollars
10bn, while personal computer sales increased 23.3 per cent to Dollars
9.7bn.
The company's data storage products division reported a precipitous 18.2 per
cent revenue decline to Dollars 5.1bn, while services revenues rose 32 per
cent to Dollars 9.7bn.
The report also shows a sharp decline in European sales over the past year,
with sales in the US and Asia Pacific regions increasing slightly.
Having outstripped the US for the previous two years, European revenues fell
about 13 per cent to Dollars 21bn last year, from almost Dollars 24bn in
1992.

FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: Brazilian mining group prospects
for joint ventures - Companhia Vale do Rio Doce is seeking international
partners through its ADR programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK MCCURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new American Depositary Receipt programme launched by Companhia Vale do
Rio Doce (CVRD), the world's largest iron ore exporter, is meant to be a
first step in a plan to finance new joint ventures with foreign companies.
The basic programme, under which the company's ADRs will be traded in the US
over-the-counter market, is likely to lead to a new equity offering in the
US next year.
This should help fund joint ventures with foreign companies, particularly in
the pulp sector. The projects will need heavy capital investment in their
early stages.
Mr Anastacio Fernandes Filho, financial director, says the company embarked
on the ADR programme, launched last week, to attract foreign investors, and
to increase its international profile and share liquidity. Currently
foreigners own about 3 per cent of the capital.
'It will be easier to issue bonds or other securities with a wider investor
base,' he says.
Created during the second world war by Brazil, the US and the UK to supply
the Allies with iron ore, and later taken over by the government, CVRD has
always been regarded as an exception to Brazil's other federally-controlled
giants.
While Brazilian governments considered areas such as telecommunications and
oil production as strategically important, and took charge of key
appointments, CVRD was given greater autonomy so that it could compete in
international markets. As a result, its management has generally been more
independent of political pressures.
Its strategy has been to exploit its huge landholdings and deposits by
diversifying into other minerals, such as copper and gold. It has also moved
into areas such as pulp and infrastructure.
The company's policy has usually been to grow through joint ventures with
Brazilian and foreign companies, often offering exploitation rights towards
the cost of the project.
These joint ventures, mainly in pulp, copper, kaolin and aluminium, have
planned capital investment of about Dollars 1.5bn over the next five years.
'CVRD has not neglected its iron ore business, and has taken minority shares
in areas where it lacks experience,' says Ms Lika Takahashi, a research
director with brokers Baring Securities Brasil.
Despite the company's strong natural advantages and efficient management, it
has been hit by the world slump in commodity prices.
Net profits for the year to the end of December 1993 fell 12 per cent to
Dollars 262m, while net sales were down slightly at Dollars 2.15bn. The
company was also affected by increased interest costs on a yen loan at its
Albras aluminium joint venture. The appreciation of the yen against the
dollar contributed to a loss of nearly Dollars 100m.
CVRD's rail and port network has now been developed to generate profits from
outside users. The transport sector was its second-largest revenue source in
1993, providing 16 per cent of net sales. Iron ore and pellets still provide
the majority of sales, accounting for 57 per cent last year.
Excluding the results of the yen appreciation and government tax credits,
profits were about Dollars 200m, according to Ms Takahashi, who expects this
figure to reach about Dollars 450m by 1996 if commodities prices recover.
Partly because of the price slump, CVRD's shares appreciated by only 44 per
cent in dollar terms last year, compared with an index gain of more than 100
per cent for the Sao Paulo stock exchange.
Following the launch of a restructuring programme in 1990, CVRD's workforce
has been cut by a quarter to less than 18,000. Analysts expect continued
improvements in efficiency, especially since the company won increased
operational independence from the federal government, which still owns 51
per cent of shares, in 1992.
CVRD's restructuring followed a worrying pile up of debt in the late 1980s.
It switched 25 per cent of its debt from the expensive and short-term local
market to longer-term paper in international markets. Its current
outstanding debt is about Dollars 1.5bn, a debt-to-equity ratio of 25 per
cent, according to the company. However, very large debts in joint ventures
such as the Albras aluminium project are not consolidated.
According to analysts, the company will be open to criticism while it
remains government-controlled. Although CVRD's management believes
privatisation is inevitable, it is beset by political difficulties and has
fallen off the agenda ahead of October's presidential elections.
Sao Paulo-based mining consultant Mr Juarez Fontana dos Santos praises CVRD
as an efficient and low-cost producer.
Nevertheless he says the company remains over-centralised and bound by
government-imposed restrictive legislation on public tenders that slow down
decisions and purchases.
However, he maintains the company is attempting to become more flexible, and
that more independence may be achieved if changes are approved under a
congressional review of the constitution. This is under way, but may not be
completed this year.
He says the company's priorities for this year are to develop its rail
transport network by forming a group to bid for the privatisation of part of
the federal railway system.
It also intends to be more aggressive in its main iron ore market. Last
month, CVRD cut its ore prices to Japan, its largest market, in response to
discounts offered by Australian competitors. 'This year we'll be more
aggressive, offering quicker delivery and better quality for certain kinds
of ore,' says Mr Fernandes.

FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: Avesta aims to raise SKr600m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Avesta Sheffield, the Swedish-British steel producer, yesterday announced a
SKr600m rights issue to back a programme of investments and restructuring
designed to strengthen the group further after cutting losses sharply in
1993.
The company, formed in late 1992 from a merger of Avesta with the stainless
steel interests of British Steel, said losses after financial items were
reduced to SKr98m (Dollars 12.48m) last year from SKr574m in 1992. Sales
were up 20 per cent to SKr14.2bn.
It said the improvement came in spite of generally weak demand, especially
for its cold rolled products, hot rolled steel plate and tubes.
The reduced losses were attributed chiefly to merger synergies, the fall in
value of the Swedish and British currencies and reduced employers
contributions and energy taxes in Sweden.
No dividend will be paid, as was the case last year.
In January the company secured a five-year syndicated bank loan of Dollars
268.75m. The new financing will bolster Avesta Sheffield - 40 per cent owned
by British Steel - as it implements a SKr600m investment and restructuring
plan, provision for which was made in the 1993 accounts.
The plans include investment in a new continuous plate production plant in
the US and the upgrading of melting shops in Sheffield and Avesta.
A melting shop in Degerfors in Sweden is to be closed down.
Avesta Sheffield said overcapacity in Europe continued to depress short and
medium-term prospects for stainless steel, but stronger demand in the Far
East and the US supported a forecast of long-term growth in consumption of
4-5 per cent a year.
The company's investment and restructuring plan should give a quick return
by increasing productivity, reducing lead times and improving costs, it
said.

FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: Chairman of LSE makes pitch for
Chinese custom

A strong pitch for Chinese companies to choose London when seeking an
overseas listing was made yesterday by Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of
the London Stock Exchange.
Opening an investment seminar in Beijing, he told bankers, securities
managers and stock regulators that the London market had the breadth of
experience and liquidity to benefit Chinese companies seeking overseas
capital.
'Companies raise more money if they issue shares on a market like London's,
where there is much investor interest and liquidity,' said Sir Andrew.
The invisibles seminar, organised by the China-Britain Trade Group, was
partly aimed at countering a trend among Chinese companies to look first at
Hong Kong and New York when considering an overseas listing.
Some six mainland companies have listed in Hong Kong in the past year or so,
and one of these - Shanghai Petrochemical - secured a joint listing in New
York.
Another 22 Chinese companies, including a number from the power sector, are
under consideration for overseas listings. Several have indicated an
interest in floating their shares in London.
Sir Andrew, who will sign a memorandum of understanding with the Shanghai
stock exchange to facilitate co-operation in trading and listing, said the
London exchange would rationalise listing requirements to eliminate
differences.
Seminar organisers said there was a good response from Chinese participants
who indicated they had not been aware of the extent of business on the
London market where some 200 new companies sought listings last year,
raising Dollars 38bn in equity capital.

FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: Mutual fund takeover bid lights
up Wall Street - Richard Waters examines the implications of the uninvited
offer from GE Capital for Kemper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of a second big takeover in the mutual fund business in the US
in a matter of months lit up Wall Street yesterday.
Shares in Kemper, the Chicago-based asset management, life insurance and
broking company, leapt by 50 per cent, or Dollars 20 7/8 , from Monday's
close on an uninvited bid from GE Capital.
The sharp move pushed Kemper's market value up to nearly Dollars 2.5bn,
above GE Capital's offer valued at Dollars 2.2bn. It signalled Wall Street's
belief that either the General Electric subsidiary would have to offer more
or the approach would prompt a rare bidding war for the financial services
company.
The bid approach from GE Capital follows Mellon Bank's Dollars 1.8bn
acquisition of Dreyfus, which marked the most aggressive move yet by a US
commercial bank to enter the booming funds business. The share prices of
other mutual fund groups also jumped yesterday, on expectations of further
deals. Franklin Resources, for instance, rose Dollars 3/4, to Dollars 47
3/4.
GE's approach came in a letter from Mr Jack Welch, chairman of the US group,
to Mr David Mathis, his opposite number at Kemper. Although written on March
2, it was only made public by GE yesterday in an apparent move to put
pressure on Kemper's board to accept the deal.
It could also be designed to force a decision before any rival suitor has a
chance to make a move. The market has been rife with rumours of an approach
for Kemper since the Dreyfus deal.
Banco Santander, the Spanish bank which took a 3 per cent stake in Kemper in
the late-1980s, is one name frequently mentioned - although its potential
involvement in a rescue bid for domestic rival Banesto could give its
management more than enough to think about in the months ahead.
Other US domestic banks, seeking to emulate Mellon, are also seen as
possible bidders.
GE's approach has caught Kemper's management in an unenviable position. The
company is only just emerging from a period overshadowed by problem real
estate investments.
Last year, Kemper sold off its reinsurance operations, and earlier this year
completed its exit from the property/casualty business.
In the view of several analysts, it could be on the verge of a rebound in
earnings - although its stock price before GE's approach became public
seemed not to reflect this.
At around Dollars 40, the shares earlier this week were trading on a
multiple of around 12 to 13 times most analysts' expectations of earnings
this year, considerably lower than other companies in the sector.
Mr Michael Blumstein, of Morgan Stanley, estimates earnings this year of
Dollars 3.75 a share, rising to Dollars 4.40 in 1995 - a view echoed in a
recent research note from Allen Nadler at Merrill Lynch.
Ironically, it was the disposal of the reinsurance business which first left
Kemper vulnerable to a bid.
The sale involved the cancellation of most of the 38 per cent stake in
Kemper owned by the Lumbermen's Mutual Casualty Company, wiping out a
potentially supportive holding.
It is not surprising that Kemper's management team, having dealt with the
problems of the early-1990s, have not welcomed GE's bid. 'They hate the fact
that someone else will come in and take the credit (for their efforts),'
said one person close to the company.
Kemper's business now comprises three parts: a mutual fund business, with
Dollars 44bn under management; a life assurance operation specialising in
annuity business; and a regional securities brokerage. The company abandoned
efforts to sell its underperforming securities arm last year, after it
failed to attract a high enough bid.
For GE Capital, a Kemper acquisition would provide a springboard into the
fastest-growing areas of the US retail investment business - mutual funds
and variable annuities.
Kemper has Dollars 70bn in all under management, which together with GE's
Dollars 75bn would create one of the US's biggest fund management groups.
In a clear attempt to win the backing of Kemper's management, Mr Welch in
his letter dangled the carrot of a consolidation of all the asset management
activities under the Kemper umbrella, run by its existing managers -
although under the wing of GE Capital.
The all-cash bid of Dollars 55 a share values the group's outstanding
ordinary shares at Dollars 1.8bn, and would be worth Dollars 2.2bn after
taking into account convertible preferred stock and stock options.
While leaning heavily on Kemper's board before it meets this Thursday, GE
seems unwilling at this stage to launch an all-out contested bid.
Such an attack would be extremely rare in the financial services business.
An unwanted deal would run the risk of driving away Kemper's best people.
It would also have to win the backing of state insurance regulators. In
addition, mutual fund groups have a powerful poison pill at their disposal:
the boards of each fund run by the group could vote to have their assets
managed by another company.
If that were to happen, a contested GE takeover would become a hollow
victory.

FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: Fannie Mae in scheme for
low-income borrowers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) yesterday launched a
series of initiatives to provide mortgage financing to help low-income
families in the US buy their own homes. The plan involves boosting the
amount of 'targeted lending' to special groups by more than Dollars 140bn to
Dollars 1,000bn before the end of the decade.
Fannie Mae's scheme comprises a series of programmes aimed at providing more
information to potential homebuyers, making it easier for low-income or
disadvantaged families to win approval for a mortgage loan, and ending
racial discrimination in the lending process.
By the end of the decade, Fannie Mae hopes to have provided a total of
Dollars 1,000bn in financing to mortgage providers, and to have helped 10m
families buy homes.
The company is the largest provider of mortgages in the US. It does not sell
mortgages directly to homebuyers, but invests in mortgages sold by mortgage
companies, savings and loan institutions and banks.
Fannie Mae will direct the programmes at low and moderate-income, and
minority families, new immigrants to the US, people living in inner-city
areas or neglected communities, and people with special housing needs.
The programmes Fannie Mae plans to introduce include: multilingual
television, radio and print advertising; support for the government's
campaign against racial discrimination in mortgage financing; second and
third reviews of rejected mortgage applications and counselling to improve
families' chances of securing mortgages; new financing tools specially
designed to help the elderly, rural families, native Americans and other
groups to secure mortgages for new homes or renovations; and investment in
technology to speed up the mortgage approval process.

up 8% for year

<TEXT>
Consolidated profits at Generale de Banque, Belgium's largest bank, rose by
8 per cent last year to BFr11.6bn (Dollars 333m), up from BFr10.7bn in the
previous 12 months.
Mr Ferdinand Chaffart, chief executive, yesterday claimed that all the
branches of the bank's activities had contributed to the growth, which was
broadly in line with market expectations.
However, he noted that the bank had benefited in particular from falling
interest rates which had boosted financial markets and stock exchanges.
In spite of an overall drop in loans, private sector lending rose by 4.5 per
cent last year. Meanwhile, gross income had risen by 14 per cent as a result
of an expansion of the group's investment funds and foreign exchange
activities, coupled with the realisation of capital gains on government
bonds and the bank's recent sale of its stake in ABN-Amro, Mr Chaffart
added.
The board of directors has proposed an increase in net dividend to BFr340
from BFr320. With the bank hoping to benefit further from a weak D-Mark, in
spite of uncertainties about the scope for further German rate cuts, Mr
Chaffart said he remained 'optimistic' about the prospects for further
growth next year.

FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: Microsoft regroups to get closer
to its customers - The world's most profitable software company is to
refocus on global marketing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bill Gates, co-founder and chairman of Microsoft, the world's largest
personal computer software company, has nightmares in which his competitors
outsmart and overwhelm him in his bid to dominate the software business in
the home and office.
That fear must have played a part in the decision, announced in the US last
night, to reorganise Microsoft from top to bottom.
A memorandum to employees signed by Mr Gates, Mr Steve Ballmer and Mr Mike
Maples, who collectively make up Microsoft's 'office of the president'
spells out the worry: 'We are trying to reach new customers and partners.
Competitors like Lotus, Novell and Electronic Arts are more focused.
'To continue to be a leader we need to innovate not only in our products but
in our sales, marketing and operations. We cannot just follow and react to
what others are doing.'
Lotus Development Corporation developed the best selling spreadsheet 1-2-3
and market leading software for workgroups 'Notes'. Novell markets the most
popular PC networking software.
What is striking about Microsoft's decision to reorganise is that, unlike
other companies forced to restructure because of falling sales or trading
losses, it remains the world's most profitable software company.
In 1993 it reported net income of Dollars 953m on sales totalling Dollars
3.75m.
Its success is based on a broad range of market leading software packages,
but especially on MS/DOS and Windows, the operating systems used by 90 per
cent of the world's 100m personal computers.
Microsoft says that if it is to continue growing, it needs a fast,
responsive organisation focusing on the customer's needs.
Among the changes called for in the plan are:
Microsoft's core technologies must be shared across the company to achieve
economies of scale and offer customers greater consistency.
The company's product strategy has to be simplified. The memorandum says:
'We are overloading the market with lots of complex messages. We need to
develop clear themes that pull together what we say about our products.'
This is taken to be a reference to confusion in the marketplace over
Microsoft's advanced Windows N/T operating system and its derivatives
codenamed Daytona and Cairo.
Products are to be grouped in seven divisions: personal operating systems,
business systems and workgroup applications, desktop applications, consumer
applications, software developer systems, advanced consumer technology and
on-line services.
Sales activities will be grouped into three customer units to give greater
customer focus: 'We will align all worldwide sales and marketing people with
one of three customer types: end users, organisations, or other equipment
manufacturers. People within these customer units will live, eat and breathe
with their customers,' the memorandum says.
A renewed focus on the competition: 'We must understand not only
competitors' products but also their sales strategies, marketing strategies,
localisation strategies and so on. We must be aggressive in taking
legitimate competitive actions.'
The memorandum goes on to say the company has to make decisions faster and
be more efficient in marketing, sales and support: 'It must be clear that it
is better to take action, make mistakes and be forgiven than to wait and ask
for permission.'
The memorandum makes clear the company is planning on a global basis.
In the past, product marketing groups were focused primarily on the US
market and subsidiaries had to develop their own marketing programmes.
'In the future we will create global marketing programmes that can be
efficiently deployed in local geographies.'
The company denied that subsidiaries would become less independent, arguing
that it would collect information from its subsidiaries in developing global
marketing strategies.

The 1993 loss was CDollars 68.7m (USDollars 51.2m) down from CDollars 110m
in 1992 on sales of CDollars 928m, up 10.4 per cent. Paper shipments were
1.3m tonnes, up from 1.25m. The company said costs had been reduced and
strong timber prices and a lower Canadian dollar had helped.

<TEXT>
Royale Belge, Belgium's largest insurance group, yesterday said that an
expansion in its life insurance businesses had helped push profits up by 11
per cent last year.
Consolidated profits for 1993 were BFr4.9bn (Dollars 94m), up from BFr4.4bn
in the previous year. Turnover rose above BFr100bn for the first time, to
BFr104.4bn in 1993.
The board is proposing a dividend of BFr160 a share, up from BFr147 the
previous year. Mr Jean-Pierre Gerard, chief executive, said that the
improvement had been helped by the healthier financial climate and the
restructuring programme which the company has implemented in the past four
years.
This restructuring, which is expected to lead to a 20 per cent cut in the
workforce over eight years, has divided the group into two specific
operations, one of which deals with independent brokers, the other with
salaried agents.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Norway's Norske Skog, one of Scandinavia's largest pulp and paper producers,
is making a two-step share issue to raise around NKr800m (Dollars 73m).
In the first step, NKr400m is to be raised through a 1-for-10 rights
offering, with preferential rights given to existing shareholders to
purchase shares of the same class. A subscription price of NKr150 per share
has been proposed.
The second step involves authorisation of the board to issue up to 2,650,000
restricted non-voting 'B' shares, aimed at international investors, to raise
another NKr400m.
'In order to broaden the company's investor base, it will be proposed that
existing shareholders waive their preferential rights for the international
offering,' Norske Skog said.
Mr Jarle Langfjaeran, a company executive, said the proceeds of the two
offerings would increase financial flexibility to undertake a number of
planned projects.
He said that in 1994, Norske Skog intended to build a new de-inking plant in
Norway used for the treatment of waste paper. Construction is to begin later
this year. At the domestic Tofte chemical pulp mill, there is a programme to
gradually convert the mill to total chlorine-free pulp. Elsewhere in Norway,
a new saw line is to be installed at an existing mill, while there are a
number of other minor projects planned for this year.

FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: Bayer result raises hopes for
German chemicals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes of an end to the German chemicals industry's four-year profits slump
were raised yesterday by the release of better-than-expected earnings
figures from the Bayer group.
In line with the company's forecasts, the dividend was left unchanged at
DM11, and sales fell only 0.5 per cent to DM41bn (Dollars 16bn).
Although Mr Manfred Schneider, chairman, suggested in January that earnings
would be better than he had forecast, net income of DM1.37bn, down 12.2 per
cent, and pre-tax profits of DM2.35bn, down 12.6 per cent, were better than
many analysts expected.
Last year, when Bayer reported pre-tax profits and sales down 19 per cent
and 2 per cent respectively in the first three-quarters of 1993, management
said it expected a fall of 20 per cent in gross earnings for the full year.
The group, which had predicted flat profits in 1994, is likely to offer a
clearer view of earnings prospects at its annual press conference on Friday.
Bayer has traditionally fared better in recession than its main domestic
rivals, Hoechst and BASF - both of which announced a DM2 cut in their 1993
dividends - because of its strength in healthcare and relative lack of
reliance on basic chemicals. The drugs businesses generate some two-thirds
of total profits.
True to form, healthcare sales were 5 per cent up at the nine-month mark,
despite reductions in domestic health services.
Yesterday's figures were released after a meeting of the supervisory board,
which also agreed to propose an end to voting restrictions, imposed in 1975,
at this year's annual meeting.
The limit, restricting shareholders' voting rights to 5 per cent regardless
of the size of their holdings, was raised at last year's meeting, when the
management hinted it was prepared to consider change.

Stock Exchange this year, reported an increase in pre-tax profits to DKr593m
(Dollars 60m) in 1993 against DKr377m in 1992.
Net profits advanced to DKr462m from DKr266m, while turnover was up at
DKr13.30bn from DKr11.35bn, of which 38 per cent was in the US, 35 per cent
in Scandinavia and 24 per cent in Europe. Group employment increased to
125,900 from 115,000.
The group said the 17 per cent advance in turnover and 13 per cent increase
in operating profits took place while important markets such as Finland and
Sweden were in recession and against a background of currency turbulence.
The Swedish and Finnish currencies depreciated against the krone by around
20 per cent.
The Dollars 93.5m acquisition of the National Cleaning Group of the US on
June 1 doubled the size of the group's North American operations. An
unchanged DKr10 per share dividend will be paid, but after a one-for-five
subscription issue last year the total pay-out increases to DKr51.9bn from
DKr43.3bn.
The East Asiatic Company, the trading group with extensive interests in East
Asia, moved back into the black with a net profit of DKr144m in 1993
compared with a loss of DKr1.18bn in 1992.
Profit after net financial items increased to DKr275m from a 1992 loss of
DKr128m. Sales were up at DKr11.12bn from DKr10.29bn for the companies
continuing in the group. The group has restructured over the past 18 months,
selling off its container line shipping services and the Plumrose food
processing companies in the UK, the USA, Australia and New Zealand.

Societe Generale de Surveillance, the Swiss inspection and insurance loss
adjusting group, reported a 1.3 per cent rise in net income in 1993 to
SFr196.1m (Dollars 91m) in spite of a SFr27.2m exceptional charge for
discontinued activities.
Earnings per share grew faster, 7.15 per cent, to SFr22.02 per registered
share and SFr110.10 per bearer share, due to the successful campaign last
year to buy back for cancellation 5 per cent of the share capital. The
directors have recommended a 7 per cent rise in dividends.
Mrs Elisabeth Salina Amorini, SGS chairman, said the group looked forward to
the current year 'with confidence', expecting that the effects of internal
restructuring and the economic recovery in the US and the UK would boost
profits. Mr Serge Pahud, finance director, said no further restructuring
charges were expected this year.
Revenues last year were up 6.8 per cent to SFr2.6bn, thanks to 6.3 per cent
of internal growth, 1.5 per cent from acquisitions and a negative 1 per cent
from exchange rate adjustments. Operating income advanced 8.9 per cent to
SFr237.4m.
Mr Thierry Chereau, chief executive, said brisk business in Asia, Africa and
Latin America offset sluggish performances in Europe and North America.
Revenues from European countries were flat at SFr1.19bn, with growth in
eastern European countries preventing a decline. Revenues from North America
were up 9 per cent to SFr648.6m while income from the Asia-Pacific region
advanced 11.1 per cent to SFr562.7m.
Net financial revenues eased only marginally to SFr59m, in spite of the
downward trend of interest rates last year, but pre-tax profits dropped 1.8
per cent to SFr269.2m because of the restructuring charges.

FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: Wolters Kluwer advances 23%

<TEXT>
Wolters Kluwer, the Dutch publisher which is expanding rapidly overseas,
posted a 23 per cent increase in net profit last year, with a large part of
the rise due to a recent string of foreign acquisitions.
The company, which said yesterday that it expected to expand into five more
European countries this year, saw net profit rise to Fl 318m (Dollars 165m)
from Fl 258m in 1992. Turnover grew to Fl 2.62bn from Fl 2.36bn, while the
dividend is to be raised to Fl 1.52 from Fl 1.32.
The importance of recent foreign expansion is reflected by the fact that
more than half of last year's 21 per cent increase in operating profit was
generated by companies acquired during 1993.
Mr Mijndert Ververs, chairman, said Wolters Kluwer, which specialises in
professional, scientific and educational publishing, hoped to be able to
announce deals in the Czech Republic and Hungary within the next few months.
The total spent on acquisitions in 1994 is likely to be less than the Fl
700m spent on acquisitions and fixed-asset investment in 1993, he said. But
in keeping with last year, acquisitions in 1994 would be financed from
internal resources.
Wolters Kluwer's biggest acquisition last year was the takeover of Sweden's
Liber Group, which fits the company's strategy of expanding in countries
that are poised to become increasingly involved with the European Union.
This policy also lies behind its interest in eastern Europe.
The company expects to see a further increase in 1994 results, in line with
its goal of achieving an average 15 per cent increase in profit per fully
diluted share in the years until 1996. In 1996, it hopes to generate 70 per
cent of its operating profit abroad, compared with 62 per cent in 1993.
Turnover in 1996 is projected to increase to between Fl 3.3bn and Fl 3.5bn.

FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: Banesto wins JP Morgan support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The caretaker board of Banesto believes it has won the support of J. P.
Morgan of the US for a major dilution of the troubled Spanish bank's equity
as part a rescue plan.
Backing from J. P. Morgan, which controls Banesto's biggest shareholder,
would remove a doubt hanging over Banesto's AGM, scheduled for March 26,
when shareholders will be asked to accept a 43 per cent write-down in the
par value of Banesto shares. It would also pave the way for the troubled
bank's re-capitalisation by the domestic financial sector.
J. P. Morgan advised Mr Mario Conde, Banesto's former chairman dismissed by
the Bank of Spain in December after inspectors discovered the bank had
grossly over-valued its assets. J. P. Morgan engineered a large rights issue
for Banesto last year and, through the Corsair Fund that it manages, had
invested Dollars 175m of US institutional funds in the Spanish bank.
A spokesman for Banesto said yesterday that although J. P. Morgan had still
not delivered its support to the new board in writing there had been
fruitful and fluid high-level contacts in the past weeks with the US bank.
Relations with J. P. Morgan had been cool following Mr Conde's sacking.
The spokesman said there had been no contact with Mr Robert Mendoza, the J.
P. Morgan vice-president who introduced the Corsair Fund to Banesto and
masterminded the rights issue. He said J. P. Morgan's office in Madrid,
which had a limited role in advising Banesto's former management, had been a
party to the renewed contacts.
It is believed that the Corsair Fund could make a further investment in
Banesto's restructured equity base to remain a significant shareholder in
the bank. Under the proposed write-down and the subsequent
re-capitalisation, the Corsair's current 7.9 per cent holding in Banesto
will be diluted to 4.5 per cent.

FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: Strong profits recovery at
Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, the French utilities and communications group,
announced a strong recovery in profits in 1993 and said it plans to
restructure its construction and public works activities to strengthen their
position in international markets.
Mr Jerome Monod, chairman, said that preliminary results showed net profits
of FFr800m (Dollars 93m) last year, more than double the FFr379m achieved in
1992 but still below the FFr1.17bn recorded in the previous year. Turnover
rose by about 3.5 per cent to FFr93.6bn.
According to Mr Monod, the improvement in results and signs of recovery in
the construction sector helped explain the group's decision to merge the
building and public works activities of its Dumez and GTM-Entrepose
subsidiaries.
The combined company, to be called Dumez-GTM, will have annual sales of
about FFr25bn and a workforce of about 35,000. According to the chairman, it
should allow the group to compete more effectively for significant
infrastructure and public works contracts expected in France, Europe and
south-east Asia. Industry observers, however, expressed caution about the
benefits.
Mr Andre Jarrosson, chairman of GTM-Entrepose, said the reorganisation
should be completed by the summer. Under the terms of the proposed
restructuring, Dumez-GTM will be held 50-50 by GTM-Entrepose and Dumez.
Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez will continue to hold 60 per cent and 100 per cent
respectively of GTM-Entrepose and Dumez.
The group said no job cuts would be involved in the reorganisation, and
there would be no direct effects on the consolidation and reporting of
earnings. GTM Entrepose, which also has non-construction activities such as
engineering and offshore contracting, will retain its market listing.
Shares in GTM-Entrepose fell by FFr28 to FFr480, reflecting concerns about
the possible impact on minority shareholders and a reduction in net profits,
from FFr202m in 1992 to FFr170m last year. By contrast, Lyonnaise des
Eaux-Dumez exceeded market expectations with its turnround from 1992,
pushing shares up FFr8 to FFr592.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Poland's biscuit market crumbles to
McVitie's

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A large share of Poland's biscuit market yesterday fell to McVitie's, a
United Biscuits subsidiary, when the biscuit and snacks producer agreed to
pay Pounds 19.1m for 80 per cent of the San factory in Jaroslaw, the
country's last large biscuit plant still in state hands.
Last year Jacobs Suchard bought the Olza plant in Cieszyn, while Bahlsen, a
German snack producer, took control of Skawina, another biscuit producer in
southern Poland.
These purchases came as PepsiCo Foods International was developing its
bourse-listed Wedel chocolate factory, bought in 1991, into a salty snacks
producer which looks set to double its 1993 net profit of 330bn zlotys
(Pounds 9.7m) this year.
Both RJR Nabisco and PepsiCo bid for San, which reported a Pounds 1.8m net
profit last year, as did the French BSN food group which has yet to purchase
a snacks plant in Poland.
Mr Hartwig Conzelmann, of McVitie's said yesterday that his company was
planning to build on San's 20 per cent market share and 'dominate the
country through a new nationwide marketing net work'.
Yesterday's agreement also spoke of plans for expansion from San's base in
south east Poland into Belarus and the Ukraine and the company is
considering building a salty snacks plant.
McVitie's intends raising San's capital by Pounds 6.7m this year and
investing a further Pounds 8.4m over the next two years. It will be
preparing a prospectus for a Warsaw stock market listing within nine months
and the Pounds 6.7m capital increase could well come from the local capital
market. McVitie's has promised to retain a 51 per cent in San for three
years.
The Central European Trust advised the Polish government on the transaction
while McVitie's was advised by Schroders.
McVitie's bought Gyori Keksz, Hungary's largest biscuit company in 1991.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: A Pounds 50m magic wand from Ford - Plans
to revive the ailing Aston Martin Lagonda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford, the US motor manufacturer, is planning to transform the fortunes of
Aston Martin Lagonda, the UK luxury sports car maker in which it acquired a
75 per cent stake in 1987.
Accounts filed at Companies House disclose for the first time the financial
scope of the project to develop a new range of Aston Martin sports cars, the
DB7, which are due to enter production next month.
Ford has injected Pounds 50m in new equity to fund the peak financing
requirements of the DB7 programme, in the process lifting its shareholding
to 99.5 per cent.
The DB7 programme has imposed a heavy burden on Aston Martin Lagonda's
finances.
The group's losses in the last two years - Pounds 18.9m in 1993 and Pounds
16m in 1992 - were incurred after charges to the profit and loss account for
the development of the DB7 totalling Pounds 13.7m in 1993 and Pounds 6.6m in
1992, including Pounds 2.1m for the original feasibility study.
The DB7 programme has led to a far-reaching reorganisation of the group.
The board now includes Mr Jackie Stewart, the former Formula 1 world
champion, Mr Nick Scheele, chairman and chief executive of Jaguar, and Mr
Tom Walkinshaw, whose TWR motor sports engineering group has played a
significant role in the DB7 project.
The Aston Martin Lagonda group accounts disclose that JaguarSport, a 50/50
Jaguar/TWR joint venture of which Mr Walkinshaw is a director, was paid
Pounds 10.1m in 1993 and Pounds 5.3m in 1992 for providing engineering
services for the development of the DB7.
Jaguar is 100 per cent owned by Ford.
The new Aston Martin sports car, expected to sell for below Pounds 80,000,
is heavily dependent on outside suppliers.
Body panels and welded bodies are to be supplied by Motor Panels, a
subsidiary of the Mayflower specialist automotive engineering and design
group.
The bodies will be painted by Rolls-Royce Motor Cars' plant at Crewe,
Cheshire, and the cars will be assembled at the plant in Bloxham,
Oxfordshire, which has previously built the Jaguar XJ220 super car.
The plant will be taken over this year by Aston Martin Lagonda. The DB7
engines will be assembled by TWR.
Last year Aston Martin produced only 144 cars at its Newport Pagnell plant
in its traditional Virage/Vantage range, which sell from Pounds 134,000 to
Pounds 178,000, but the group's output is now forecast to increase fivefold
with DB7 production set to total 600-700 a year.
Output of the DB7 starts next month with deliveries beginning in the UK in
the summer and in the US and Canada in the autumn of 1995. Output next year
is expected to total 625.
While the DB7 has been under development the existing Aston Martin business
based on the Virage/Vantage range has been under heavy pressure as a result
of recession in the US and UK.
Turnover fell from Pounds 27.3m in 1990 to Pounds 20.8m in 1991 and Pounds
12.4m in 1992, although sales began to recover to Pounds 15.9m last year
with a pick-up in both the UK and the US. The workforce has been drastically
reduced to an average 285 last year from 359 in 1992, 448 in 1991 and 522 in
1990.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Evans Halshaw beats forecast with Pounds
7.81m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Evans Halshaw, the Birmingham-based motor distribution and vehicle
management group, yesterday delivered its promise of a fourfold increase in
1993 profits and prompted a 17p rise in the share price to 549p.
It announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.81m for the 12 months to December,
compared with Pounds 1.71m for 1992.
Last November, when the group bought TK Motor Group, it forecast 1993
profits of Pounds 7.5m.
Earnings per share climbed from 5.4p to 24.3p, providing cover of 1.86 times
for the increased dividend.
The proposed final is 9.2p (7.65p), making a total of 13p, against 11.25p
for 1992 when payments to shareholders were partially financed from
reserves.
Turnover rose from Pounds 341.5m to Pounds 404.7m as the new and used car
market revived. New car sales were 28 per cent ahead and used car sales 16
per cent ahead of 1992.
However, the staple source of Evans Halshaw's profits - the servicing, parts
sales and accident repair market - was flat until towards the end of the
year.
This after-market provided 62 per cent of group profits, compared with 70
per cent in 1992. There was no absolute decline of earnings from the
after-market, but its share of group profits fell because earnings from car
sales rose.
Capital investment, notably in a second motor village at Solihull, West
Midlands, where five dealerships are grouped together, totalled Pounds 5.1m
last year. Mr Geoffrey Dale, chairman and chief executive, expects spending
this year to be slightly less.
'Across the group, car sales have been buoyant in the first two months of
1994 and our trading results are significantly ahead of the same period last
year,' Mr Dale said.
COMMENT
Evans Halshaw is riding up the economic cycle and its profits would no doubt
increase even if it did nothing except avoid silliness. In fact, it is
expanding into a fragmented market with costs already pared. It is now
obtaining the benefits of its investment of the last two years. Solihull
alone this year should sell 5,000 cars. It is developing other streams of
revenue like the sale of fleet management software. It is unrealistic to
expect another fourfold profits increase, but feasible to think of pre-tax
profits this year pushing towards Pounds 13m to give earnings per share of
about 40p. On a prospective multiple of less than 14, it looks as if they
have some way yet to motor, always providing that economic recovery is
sustained.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Hall Engineering leaps to Pounds 8.6m and
lifts dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hall Engineering (Holdings) yesterday announced a sharp rise in 1993 pre-tax
profits from a restated Pounds 2.36m to Pounds 8.56m and is raising its
dividend for the year by 10 per cent to 9.5p, with a final of 3.02p.
The Shrewsbury-based metal stockholding, steel products and automotive
engineering group benefited from higher margins in its steel reinforcement
business, especially in the first half, the completion of its UK
rationalisation and another rise in profits from associated companies in the
Pacific Rim.
Pre-tax profits for 1992 have been restated for FRS 3, and would have been
Pounds 5.6m on a pre-FRS 3 and pre-exceptional cost basis.
Sales last year rose 8 per cent from Pounds 135.7m to Pounds 146m, and also
by 8 per cent, to Pounds 182m, if share of associates' sales is included.
Earnings per share rose to 19.18p, against 3.05p in 1992 when there was a
loss per share of 1.67p under the basic calculation including exceptional
items.
In metal stockholding, losses were cut by Pounds 800,000 to Pounds 183,000,
while the steel reinforcement business turned a Pounds 1.5m loss into a
Pounds 62,000 profit.
Profits in the engineering division fell by Pounds 1m to Pounds 3.2m, due
mainly to reduced profits and redundancy costs in Stadco's pressings
division. Profits in the automation division were slightly ahead.
Mr Richard Hall, chairman, said the takeover of Rover by BMW could help
Stadco win business for the first time from the German car group, and
Stadco's recently-announced joint venture with Honda Engineering would not
be affected.
On the outlook, Mr Hall said he would be very disappointed if the company
could not further improve profits slightly this year. In some businesses,
confidence is much higher than at the same time last year, although others
are still indirectly affected by the recession in continental Europe.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Ransomes Pounds 8.9m into the red -
Restructuring costs and heavy interest charges behind deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ransomes, the manufacturer of grass-cutting equipment, yesterday reported
sharply increased losses as it struggled with the twin burdens of
large-scale restructuring and heavy debt.
The two factors led to pre-tax losses of Pounds 8.9m in the 12 months to
December 31, compared with a restated 1992 deficit of Pounds 600,000.
Mr John Clement, chairman, blamed the decline on a restructuring programme
involving a 12 per cent cut in the workforce, the removal of a tier of
senior management and the contraction of its operating divisions.
The programme led to a threefold increase in exceptional charges to Pounds
5.8m.
Operating profits, meanwhile, fell by 35 per cent to Pounds 5.3m amid
intense competition in the US and flat sales in Europe.
The figures were dented further by interest charges of Pounds 8.4m (Pounds
8.7m) on net borrowings of Pounds 75.3m (Pounds 76.1m), representing gearing
of 450 per cent.
Despite the problems, Mr Clement, who took over as chairman last October,
said its principal bankers had agreed to maintain existing borrowing
facilities of Pounds 120m.
They have also backed moves to reshape the group by Mr Peter Wilson,
appointed chief executive last autumn.
Mr Wilson initiated the redundancy programme, closed some overseas
facilities and reorganised group operations in two new divisions -
commercial and consumer.
Profits in the commercial operation fell sharply to Pounds 1.76m (Pounds
7.11m) following the group's failure to exploit market opportunities -
particularly among golf course operators. Its poor performance was offset by
increased demand in the consumer division, which saw operating profits
increase 25 per cent to Pounds 3.52m.
Group turnover rose slightly to Pounds 165.8m (Pounds 156.6m).
Losses per share worked through at 26.1p against a restated 11.5p.
The company, which omitted its interim dividend, is also passing the final
on both its ordinary and cumulative preference shares.
COMMENT
Ransomes is paying the price for its dash for growth in 1989 when it
acquired Cushman, the US grass machinery group, for Dollars 150m (Pounds
103m). Although, the new management has begun to tackle the debt burden left
by that purchase, it faces an uphill struggle. The pressure has been
increased by its decision to change the year end to September, leaving only
10 months to produce some positive results. Nevertheless, it claims to have
already stripped out Dollars 10m of costs in the US and Pounds 1.5m at home.
Analysts, who were unwilling to make profit forecasts, warned the group
would have to make operating gains of more than Pounds 5.7m just to pay its
dividend liability and generate earnings per share.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Lionheart back in black with Pounds 1.77m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lionheart, the Cheshire-based paint brushes and housewares group, returned
to profit in 1993 with Pounds 1.77m pre-tax, a Pounds 2.64m turnround on
1992's deficit of Pounds 870,000. Mr Paul Lever, chairman, said an
acquisition was now likely within months, writes Ian Hamilton Fazey.
Turnover rose by 7 per cent to Pounds 46.7m (Pounds 43.6m), giving a
profit-to-sales ratio of 3.8 per cent. With earnings per share of 0.49p
(losses 0.59p) a final dividend of 0.2p is proposed making 0.3p (0.2p) for
the year.
The group returned to the dividend list only two years ago after
reconstruction under Mr Lever, the chairman and former chief executive of
Crown Paints.
Talks are understood to have begun about an acquisition with an announcement
in the first half of the current year.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Wainhomes share issue priced at 170p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wainhomes, the Chester-based housebuilder, yesterday announced details of
its plans to raise Pounds 30.5m from a flotation and offer for sale at 170p
a share.
The total amount to be raised is Pounds 41.9m including the sale of 5.8m
shares by existing institutional shareholders.
The issue will give the company a market value of about Pounds 106m. It
plans to place 16m shares mostly with institutions while offering a further
8.62m shares for sale to the public. After the sale it will have 62.24m
shares in issue.
Wainhomes is forecasting earnings of not less than 9.3p per share for the
year ending March 31, putting the group on a p/e of 18.3 times the issue
price.
It said that if it had been already quoted it would have recommended a total
dividend of 4.2p net, representing a notional gross dividend yield of 3.1
per cent.
The company is the latest in a growing list of UK housebuilders to issue
shares to finance land purchases to take advantage of the housing market
recovery. It is forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.1m for the year to
the end of March, a 15 per cent gain on the previous year's Pounds 5.3m.
It expects to have sold about 950 homes by the end of March, which should
rise to between 1,200 and 1,500 next year, before increasing to 1,800. The
company will use the proceeds to repay borrowings - currently Pounds 17m -
and to buy land.
COMMENT
On the basis of earnings and yield the offer price of 170p is at a slight
premium to Beazer, a large proven housebuilder, which announced its
flotation terms last week. Wainhomes as a small provincial builder however,
has more to gain from increased volumes - and its margins stand comparison
with the better builders. Given market demand for the sector, both Beazer
and Wainhomes issues should succeed.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Heywood Williams in sixfold rise to Pounds
35.2m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
   Andrew Taylor, Construction Correspondent
Pre-tax profits of Heywood Williams Group, the building and automotive
components group, rose more than six times in 1993 from Pounds 5.5m to
Pounds 35.2m.
The company was assisted by significant gains following a series of
disposals and acquisitions. Operating profits, even after stripping out
these benefits, still rose by 86 per cent from Pounds 8.02m to Pounds
14.99m.
The Pounds 95m sale of the group's UK glass division to Pilkington added a
further Pounds 15m to these profits. Another Pounds 2.99m came from the
first six months earnings of LaSalle-Deitch, which supplies components and
furnishings for manufactured homes in the US.
Interest on Heywood's cash balances, currently about Pounds 10m, increased
pre-tax profits by another Pounds 500,000, compared with a debit of Pounds
3.02m.
Bridgewater, the UK automotive glass replacement business acquired last
autumn, and which is in the process of being re-organised, also contributed
a small profit.
Since the year end Heywood has completed the acquisition of Bristol
Products, the US plumbing components supplier, for Dollars 81.2m (Pounds
53.4m). The purchase was funded by a rights issue which raised Pounds 52.4m
at the end of last year.
The company, as forecast, is paying a final dividend of 8.5p (8p) making a
total for the year of 13p (12.5), the first dividend increase for two years.
Earnings per share were 36.2p (1.7p) or 32.9p (1.7p) diluted or 15.5p (1.7p)
before exceptional profit on the disposal to Pilkington. Turnover fell from
Pounds 389.5m to Pounds 365.6m.
The shares following the announcement rose 7p to 437p compared with a rights
issue price in December of 280p.
Mr Ralph Hinchliffe, chairman, said: 'The sale of the under-performing UK
glass businesses, and the acquisitions we have made to secure and strengthen
key market positions in the more buoyant US manufactured housing and
recreational vehicles markets, has transformed our prospects.'
COMMENT
The tide is starting to turn in favour of Heywood Williams' main markets. US
housing and automotive businesses, accounting for almost half of group
turnover, are growing stronger as the economy recovers. Bad winter weather,
also, will have had less of an impact on manufactured homes than on general
housebuilding. In the UK, the homes market should continue to improve, while
increased investment in depots should offset any temporary softening of the
market following last year's introduction of windscreen checking in MoT
tests. Pre-tax profits could approach Pounds 40m this year. A quality
management and strong balance sheet makes the company worth an investment at
this level.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Crockfords gambling profits rise 16%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Crockfords, the casino company that was reversed into TV-am last summer,
lifted profits from its gambling business by 16 per cent in 1993. Operating
profits from the continuing gambling side rose from Pounds 19.8m to Pounds
23m on gaming turnover up from Pounds 44.4m to Pounds 51.3m.
At the pre-tax level profits for the year to end-December were Pounds 23.2m
against Pounds 38m in 1992, with the 1992 figure including Pounds 15.7m of
operating profits from TV-am, which stopped broadcasting on December 31
1992.
Crockfords opened London's first legal casino in Curzon Street in 1961. Last
August the company reversed into TV-am, which had lost its licence and was
planning a voluntary liquidation.
Mr Garry Nesbitt, chairman, said the group was firmly established at the
upper end of the London gaming market.
While the number of casinos in London was unchanged at 21, the total gaming
income was 34 per cent ahead at Pounds 304m. 'I believe that a significant
proportion of this increase may have been from the higher value players for
whom we cater,' Mr Nesbitt said.
Basic earnings per share were 16.18p (24.05p).
A final dividend of 2.5p is proposed for the first four months of the year,
equivalent to 7.5p for the full year.
Mr Nesbitt said the strategy was to develop the existing club, on which
Pounds 700,000 was spent last year, and to look out for other London
casinos. It would also be seeking acquisitions or start-up opportunities 'in
Europe and other overseas areas where gaming is well regulated'.
COMMENT
Profits at Crockfords depend on a small number of big hitters - the
prospectus said that over three years ten exceptional players had accounted
for 50 per cent. Clearly the company needs at least one more casino to
diversify its risks. But it is highly cash generative and ungeared, so
should be able to move quickly once an opportunity arises. Given the same
level of business this year earnings could reach more than 16.5p. A dividend
of 8p would represent a yield of more than 6.5 per cent - worth the gamble.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Everest shares fall 9p on warning about
static second half results
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Everest Foods tumbled 9p to 68p yesterday after the West
Midlands-based egg and chip producer said it was unlikely to achieve full
year profits in accordance with market expectations.
Mr Bob Gilbert, chairman, said the trend towards economy products had
resulted in severe pressure on margins.
This meant that pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 1.18m to Pounds 1.08m in
the six months to November 30, although turnover grew by nearly Pounds 3m to
Pounds 19m.
The company had taken steps to make manufacturing processes as cost
effective as possible. However, Mr Gilbert warned that if current trading
conditions persisted, full year profits were unlikely to improve
substantially on the interim figure.
Although earnings per share slipped from 3.15p to 2.9p, the interim dividend
has been held at 1.2p and a scrip dividend alternative proposed.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Likely Pounds 60m tag on Robert Wiseman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Robert Wiseman Dairies, the Scottish liquid milk processor and distributor,
yesterday issued the pathfinder prospectus for the institutional placing
which should lead to it obtaining a stock market listing by the end of the
month.
The placing, by Panmure Gordon, should raise between Pounds 15m and Pounds
16m, leaving 75 per cent of the company in family hands. It is likely to
value the company at about Pounds 60m.
The terms of the placing will be announced on March 22.
Robert Wiseman concentrates on supplying branded milk in cartons to stores
in Scotland and is expanding in the north of England from a base in
Manchester.
In the 39 weeks to January 1 1994 turnover was Pounds 44.26m and pre-tax
profit was Pounds 4.25m.
About half the placing will finance a milk processing plant in Manchester
while the rest will be to complete the recent purchase of Mackie's dairy
near Aberdeen and future acquisitions.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Delta falls slightly to Pounds 53.4m -
Dividend increase reflects company's optimism on prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Delta, the cables and engineering group, reported flat annual results
yesterday, but signalled guarded optimism about the economic outlook by
increasing its dividend for the first time since 1990.
Pre-tax profits dipped from Pounds 55.1m to Pounds 53.4m in the year to
January 1, mainly because of higher interest charges following its Pounds
37m purchase of the outstanding 36 per cent stake in Delta Crompton Cable
Holdings from BTR, the industrial conglomerate. Sales rose from Pounds 786m
to Pounds 833m.
Earnings per share increased marginally to 23.1p (23p). A final dividend of
10.3p lifts the total to 14.5p (14p).
Mr Robert Easton, chief executive, said Delta was one of the first UK
companies to freeze dividends as the downturn took hold, but now hoped it
had seen the bottom of the recession in continental Europe.
The upbeat tone was carefully qualified by Delta, which in September saw its
shares marked down sharply after it warned that the UK recovery in
manufacturing was more anaemic than many observers were suggesting.
Mr Geoffrey Wilson, chairman, said yesterday: 'Whilst current patterns of
demand remain patchy, early indications suggest a strengthening in some
sectors. Whilst we have seen transient effects before, there is now greater
evidence to suggest that the economic tide may be finally on the turn.'
Delta said it was another tough year, with continuing depressed and fiercely
competitive trading. European construction markets showed little recovery.
Mr Wilson said: 'Early signs of more encouraging activity in the UK soon
relapsed and demand then persisted at depressed levels. Prices remained
under pressure, particularly in cables.'
Delta shed 800 jobs last year, bringing the total employed down to 13,300.
The group has cut its workforce by a third since 1989. Mr Easton said he
would 'go on trimming - but the battle will moderate'.
The cables division suffered particularly from UK price wars, with operating
profits lower at Pounds 5.89m (Pounds 8.68m). Circuit protection dipped to
Pounds 15.8m (Pounds 17.1m) and engineering to Pounds 19.9 (Pounds 22.2m).
Industrial services however, rose to Pounds 18.5m (Pounds 12.8m).
COMMENT
Actions speak louder than words, and Delta's willingness to let dividend
cover fall to 1.6 strikes a more positive note than the chairman's heavily
hedged statement on prospects. Analysts were struck by how tough things were
in the cable market, but still believe Delta's willingness to reduce its
cost base makes it heavily geared to any upturn. Action, rather than further
talk, on a possible US acquisition would also be appreciated. The shares,
down 7p to 522p, are on a prospective multiple of about 19. The 20 per cent
premium to the market reflects Delta's recovery stock status, but does not
look unjustified.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Improved production helps Aviva cut losses
to Dollars 2.63m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aviva Petroleum, the small US-based oil and gas explorer, quoted in the UK,
yesterday announced sharply lower net losses of Dollars 2.63m (Pounds 1.8m),
against Dollars 10.23m last year, because of improved production from the
group's Colombian project.
The better result was achieved on virtually static oil and gas sales of
Dollars 10.68m, against Dollars 10.42m last time.
The loss per share was reduced from 124 cents to 11 cents. As in the past
there is no dividend.
Mr Ron Suttill, chief executive, said he was confident the group would be
able to achieve profits in spite of a depressed oil price.
Aviva was aiming to break even by the end of the current year, he said.
He stressed the potential of further development of the Colombian project,
jointly owned with Ecopetrol, the state energy company.
By 1995 Aviva hoped to earn some 24,000 barrels a day from its share of the
Colombian fields, which would result in a net cash flow contribution of
about Dollars 12m a year, Mr Suttill said.
Net production from Colombia increased by 54 per cent to 279,000 barrels
during the year. Mr Suttill said the increase, combined with a 10 per cent
rise in US gas prices, more than offset a decline in oil and gas volumes in
the US and reductions in the US and Colombian oil price. Currently all of
Aviva's Colombian production is sold to Ecopetrol.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Graseby surges ahead to Pounds 9.57m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Graseby, the medical electronics, product monitoring, environmental and
defence technology group, yesterday reported sharply higher 1993 profits
reflecting growing international sales, lower interest costs and the absence
of exceptional charges.
Pre-tax profits for the year to end-December jumped to Pounds 9.57m from the
depressed Pounds 1.02m recorded in 1992, when they were reduced by Pounds
4.3m of net exceptional costs.
Earnings per share jumped to 11.4p (1.3p) and, in line with the board's
previously announced decision, the final dividend is being reduced to 3.3p
(7.6p) making a total for the year of 6.6p (10.9p). The shares closed down
5p at 181p.
Turnover increased by 10.8 per cent to Pounds 113.7m (Pounds 102.6m)
including Pounds 15.4m (Pounds 22.4m) from discontinued operations. Sales
from continuing operations grew by 22 per cent to Pounds 98.7m with exchange
rate movements accounting for just over a third of the increase.
International sales grew by 21 per cent, excluding exchange rate movements,
reflecting the group's reduced dependence on the domestic market.
Operating profits increased to Pounds 11m (Pounds 7.85m) including a Pounds
501,000 contribution from discontinued operations. In 1992 discontinued
operations reduced profits by Pounds 1.32m.
The advance was led by an exceptionally strong performance by the defence
business, where a number of large orders were completed resulting in the
technology division reporting profits of Pounds 4.2m (Pounds 571,000) on
sales up 24 per cent to Pounds 34.3m.
In contrast, operating profits and trading margins slipped in the three
other divisions despite increased sales.
Net interest costs fell to Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 2.52m) partly reflecting a
decline in year-end borrowings from Pounds 20.7m to Pounds 15.9m,
representing gearing of 66 per cent - down from 99 per cent.
COMMENT
Graseby has completed its transformation from a group dependent on the
volatile defence and component sectors to an international instrument
supplier focused on four distinct value-added markets. The balance sheet is
now in much better shape and borrowings should fall further - even without
the deferred flotation of Graseby Anderson in the US. Although several of
its markets - including the UK medical market - face pricing pressures, the
overall trading margin should edge higher again this year towards the
group's 15 per cent target. Pre-tax profits of about Pounds 10m this year
should provide earnings of about 11.7p. The shares are trading on a
prospective p/e of 15.5 and look slightly undervalued.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Rugby Estates net worth will triple after
flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rugby Estates, the property investment company run by the former property
team at Hillsdown, the food group, is planning to raise Pounds 20m from a
flotation which will triple its net worth.
Rugby Estates was set up in 1990, 51 per cent owned by the management, led
by Mr David Tweeddale-Tye, chairman, and Mr Andrew Wilson, managing
director, and 49 per cent by Hillsdown. It started from scratch and had net
assets of Pounds 6.8m at the end of 1993, and a property portfolio now
valued at Pounds 29.2m.
The management is offering a three-year-old company which made pre-tax
profits of only Pounds 2m in 1993. But they boast a long and profitable
history with Hillsdown, which almost floated its property arm in 1987.
Mr Tye ran Hillsdown's property arm throughout the 1980s. He built up gross
assets of Pounds 100m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 18m at the market peak
of 1989, and succeeded in selling around two thirds of its portfolio before
the slump.
Rugby will raise Pounds 19.7m net of expenses from the share placement, of
which Pounds 4.7m will be used to repay a loan to Hillsdown and Pounds 2.6m
to buy a portfolio of properties from the food group. Gearing will fall to 5
per cent, providing scope for new investment.
Hillsdown is selling its entire shareholding, valued at about Pounds 4m,
through the placement. The management will own about 13 per cent of the
enlarged company.
Mr Tye said Rugby would continue to focus on retail properties, which
represent 80 per cent of the current portfolio. It is also likely to remain
an active property trader.
Rugby's speciality is buying secondary market properties where it can add
value through intensive management. The company's first investment, the
Brunswick Centre, has appreciated by 93 per cent since its purchase for
Pounds 2.85m in January 1991.
The full prospectus will be issued on March 30, and dealings are expected to
commence on April 8.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Cost cutting helps lift Scholes 84%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scholes Group, the electrical installation equipment group, yesterday
announced an 84 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.3m to
Pounds 2.4m for the six months to December, despite a marginal increase in
UK sales.
Turnover rose 5 per cent to Pounds 31.1m, but this was boosted by exports,
which increased by 21 per cent to Pounds 3.8m and now account for 12 per
cent of group sales.
Scholes' earnings growth was achieved primarily through further lowering of
the company's cost base, but also through some price increases in its major
business, manufacturing switchgear for the domestic housing market.
Operating profit margins increased from 5.5 per cent to 8.3 per cent at the
interim stage, and Mr Bill Riches, chairman, said he was confident further
operational streamlining could be achieved.
Mr Riches said: 'Management continues to focus on lowering the group's cost
structure and pursuing ways of enhancing manufacturing productivity.'
He said it would be tough for the company to achieve further price
increases, however, due to increasing competition from European
manufacturers prepared to buy market share at the expense of profit margins.
The company remains cash positive, and its net cash position increased by 37
per cent to Pounds 2.2m in December.
Scholes also announced that it had agreed to sell its 17 per cent stake in
Malaysian-listed PWE Industries.
The company will pay an interim dividend of 1.7p (1.6p). Earnings per share
increased from 2.4p to 4.3p.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Seafield ahead to Pounds 1.62m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits of Seafield Resources, the USM-quoted oil and gas
exploration company, rose from Pounds 1.06m to Pounds 1.62m in the year to
end-December.
At the operating level profits were up from Pounds 632,000 to Pounds 1.5m.
Turnover grew by 39 per cent from Pounds 5.55m to Pounds 7.74m, the bulk of
which - Pounds 6.8m - was generated in the UK from the group's 5 per cent
interest in the Victor gas field.
As part of last year's overhaul of North Sea taxation rules, companies were
prevented from offsetting exploration and appraisal spending against income
from fields which incur Petroleum Revenue Tax.
Although the terms were ultimately modified to include a limited form of
transitional relief, the outcome this time suffered from a surge in the tax
charge from Pounds 200,000 to Pounds 967,000. This impacted on earnings,
which fell from 1.7p to 1.3p.
Operating cash flow was up 82 per cent at Pounds 4.84m (Pounds 2.66m).
Mr John Raitt, chairman, said that hydrocarbons had been encountered in all
five UK wells in which the company participated.
Two of these wells were significant discoveries, and one successfully
appraised an extension to the Victor field, confirming additional reserves.
The balance sheet remained strong with no debt, he added.
The company said it intended to apply for a full listing when the
simplified, low cost, procedure for USM companies had been finalised.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Wimpey bounces back into black with Pounds
25.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wimpey, following its biggest ever pre-tax loss of Pounds 111.6m in 1992,
bounced back into the black last year with pre-tax profits of Pounds 25.5m.
Trading profits rose 85 per cent from Pounds 22.1m to Pounds 40.9m, boosted
by a strong recovery in UK housing, with completed sales up by a quarter to
6,936.
Group turnover fell from Pounds 1.64bn to Pounds 1.59bn. The final dividend
is again 3.25p, maintaining the total for the year at 5.25p, just covered by
earnings of 6.81p a share.
Housing, in spite of only breaking even overseas, moved from a Pounds 33.3m
loss in 1992 to a Pounds 25.4m profit last year. Operating margins in the
UK, having fallen in every year since 1989, more than doubled from 3 per
cent to 6.5 per cent last year. This compared with a peak of 19 per cent
four years ago.
Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive, was optimistic about further rises in UK
house sales and margins, with prices already starting to edge off the bottom
in south-east England.
He said the company had seen no evidence that tax rises due to take effect
next month were dampening demand from prospective purchasers.
Wimpey would be selling its house building businesses in France, Spain,
Australia and southern California to concentrate on its UK and other US
housing operations. Also still up for sale was Pounds 135m of commercial
property investments.
The group has raised more than Pounds 300m from disposals, transforming its
balance sheet and reducing gearing from 30 per cent to 5 per cent, the
lowest level for 20 years.
Net debt of Pounds 28m at end-December, however, is expected to rise this
year as the group increases land purchases, while UK house sales are
expected to top 7,500 during the period. Gearing was likely to reach 30 per
cent, implying net debt of about Pounds 160m.
Construction profits halved from Pounds 4.5m to Pounds 2.2m on turnover down
from Pounds 683m to Pounds 659m, reflecting the difficult conditions in the
UK. The figures however excluded Pounds 8m of interest on advanced payments
on construction projects.
Minerals, helped by a Pounds 7.9m windfall planning gain, rose to Pounds
13.1m (Pounds 1.6m).
COMMENT
Wimpey's results were bang in line with expectations. Even so its share
price fell 8p to 210p following the figures. The market having given the
company credit for rebuilding its balance sheet is concerned about where it
goes next. There is concern that its emphasis on first time buyers will mean
that margin recovery may be restricted. The UK aggregates business also
compares unfavourably with its main rival, Tarmac. The company talks bravely
of acquisitions and organic expansion, but now needs to deliver. Profits of
Pounds 45m put the group on a prospective p/e of more than 20. The shares,
after a good run, are now suffering.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Visa EMEA spending rises 13% to Dollars
183bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The amount of spending using Visa cards within the Europe, Middle East and
Africa region (EMEA) totalled Dollars 183bn (Pounds 125.3bn) in 1993, some
13 per cent higher than in 1992.
The number of Visa EMEA card transactions rose by almost 5 per cent to
2.36bn, while the number of Visa cards in existence rose by more than 5 per
cent to 70.8m.
Mr Jean-Jacques Desbons, president and chief executive of Visa EMEA, said
the organisation was confident that growth 'will continue throughout the
next year and will increase further as the world economy starts picking up.'
Both the increases in card-holder spending in terms of US dollars and in the
number of cards in 1993 against the previous year are lower in percentage
terms than annual increases since 1989.
Mr Desbons also said Visa planned to introduce its Electron card into the UK
before the end of the year. It is already available elsewhere and can be
used only through electronic means. Because each transaction would be
authorised individually by the banks, the card would offer greater security,
and so banks might be prepared to make it available to more of their
customer base than existing cards.
Visa EMEA represents about 36 per cent of Visa International's worldwide
sales volume.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Paterson Zochonis rises 15%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Paterson Zochonis, the detergents manufacturer, was bullish yesterday about
prospects as it announced a 15 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits
to Pounds 13.6m.
The increase was achieved on sales 3 per cent ahead to Pounds 126m for the
six months to November 30.
The company said it was confident that, barring any unexpected currency
movements, it would increase profits from last time's Pounds 25.3m in the
year to May 31. The interim dividend was increased by 4 per cent to 2.45p.
Earnings were 18 per cent higher at 17.69p.
During the first half, profits were helped by lower interest charges, an
increased contribution from associates and an improved operating return.
Interest charges fell by 18 per cent to Pounds 2.74m, while the contribution
from associates rose by Pounds 600,000 to Pounds 1.83m.
The company said trading in parts of Africa was becoming increasingly
difficult, particularly in Nigeria, the Congo and Cameroun.
In Europe, Paterson increased sales of Cussons soaps and toiletries in a
competitive market. The Polish detergents manufacturer returned an
encouraging performance, the company said.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Holders bid to oust Andrews Sykes board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rebel shareholders at Andrews Sykes, the lossmaking industrial services
group, yesterday launched a bid to oust the board in a re-run of a similar
coup attempt 18 months ago.
Dissidents led by Mr Jacques Murray, who holds 29.2 per cent of the Midlands
company, have called an extraordinary meeting at which they hope to win
management control.
A spokesman for Mr Murray, chairman of Nu-Swift, the fire protection group,
said the move reflected dissatisfaction with Sykes' performance.
Last December, the group reported interim pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.34m
(Pounds 802,000 profit).
'We want to support the company and bring about an improvement,' Mr Murray's
spokesman added.
Mr David Hubbard, group chairman, said the board would fight the rebel
action and would seek the support of institutional shareholders.
Opposition by institutional investors defeated Mr Murray 18 months ago after
the last battle for control. Andrews Sykes has now offered Mr Murray board
representation, but not majority control. His spokesman said the offer had
not been rejected, but described the extraordinary meeting as a parallel
tactic.
Andrews Sykes shares closed up 5p at 90p.

Wassall, the conglomerate which lost the bid battle for Evode last year, saw
pre-tax profits jump from Pounds 17.8m to Pounds 27.6m in 1993 on sales up
11 per cent to Pounds 277.8m.
Profits were boosted by the Pounds 103m rights issue launched to fund the
thwarted Evode bid. But the issue diluted earnings per share which rose 23
per cent to 11.7p.
Mr Chris Miller, chief executive, said that earnings per share would have
been 11 per cent higher but for the rights issue, though they were lifted 8
per cent by exchange rate movements.
The loss of Evode, where Wassall was outbid by Laporte, has been followed by
further disappointments, including abortive talks with Fenner. 'We have got
quite close to a number of things but most failed for price-related
reasons,' said Mr Miller.
'We are as confident as you can be that there will be an acceptable deal in
the not too distant future,' he added.
Although Wassall is still viewed as an acquisition-driven group, Mr Miller
pointed to the strong organic growth shown by the 32 per cent increase in
operating profit to Pounds 27.2m. 'That suggests there is something we are
doing that is not straight asset-stripping.'
He said the improvement was 'particularly satisfactory' given that most of
its markets outside the US experienced little or no recovery last year.
Even in the US, its DIY products supplier DAP has had to work hard to
increase sales and most of the advance came from higher margins. Its
operating profits rose from Pounds 10.5m to Pounds 13.7m, on sales Pounds
20.7m higher at Pounds 146.7m.
Metal Closures, the bottle top manufacturer which was the group's first
large acquisition, continued to make good progress. The South African arm,
which contributes nearly 30 per cent of group profits, had an 'excellent'
year in difficult conditions and the division's profits rose to Pounds 12.2m
(Pounds 9.3m) on sales of Pounds 82.1m (Pounds 76.6m).
A final dividend of 2.4p gives a total up 36 per cent at 3.4p (2.5p).
COMMENT
It may be that the ex-Hanson men who run Wassall are just too choosy when it
comes to buying companies. But then they can afford to be. Their past
acquisitions are still generating the sort of improvements that most
'growth' companies would kill for. Perhaps most remarkable of all is the
progress of Metal Closures' South African business, where profits have risen
from Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 8m since Wassall bought the company in 1990. This
exposure may unsettle the nervous, though Mr Miller points out things would
have to get pretty bad to hit sales of bottle tops. The real worry is
Wassall's inability to find an earnings enhancing acquisition despite the
low returns on its cash pile. Without some action before long, the shares'
deservedly high rating will be hard to sustain. On current year forecasts of
about Pounds 31.5m the shares at 295p, up 10p, are on a multiple of over 22.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Tiphook's shares rise on container sale
completion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Tiphook rose by 5p to 55p yesterday after the debt-laden transport
leasing group confirmed the completion of the sale of its container business
to Transamerica, the US financial services group, writes Andrew Bolger.
Proceeds of Pounds 673m were received yesterday by Tiphook, which could
receive a further Pounds 49m from the deal.
The final consideration depends on changes in the net assets of the
container operations between September 30 and yesterday, and is subject to a
completion audit.
Tiphook, which had debts of more than Pounds 1bn, had warned that its
survival depended on the successful disposal.
Completion of the sale was conditional on consents by a majority of the
group's US bondholders.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Shift in focus leaves Williams down at
Pounds 153m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Williams Holdings, the industrial conglomerate, yesterday announced improved
cashflow and a 13 per cent increase in profits before exceptional items to
Pounds 170.3m for the year to December 31.
An exceptional charge of Pounds 17.1m, to cover the loss on disposal of the
bulk of Williams' engineering division to management for Pounds 40m in
December, depressed pre-tax profits by Pounds 4.2m to Pounds 153.2m. The
sale is part of the group's strategy to focus on three sectors - building
products, security and fire protection.
Cashflow from operating activities, for which Williams has been criticised
in the past, improved by 15 per cent to Pounds 227.9m. This represented 119
per cent of operating profits.
Mr Nigel Rudd, chief executive, was bullish about the outlook for the
group's main operating markets, saying there were definite signs of recovery
in the UK and US. Some 80 per cent of the group's sales are from those two
markets. In the UK however, 'government policy and consumer caution will
limit the pace and degree of demand improvement,' he said.
Williams was seeking growth in spite of such difficulties, Mr Rudd said,
through expanding its share of even sluggish markets by tapping new outlets.
The group's sales were 17 per cent higher at Pounds 1.21bn, including a
Pounds 66.9m contribution from acquisitions. Continuing businesses were 11
per cent up at Pounds 1.1bn.
Williams pursued acquisitions aggressively during the year, spending Pounds
157.6m on seven businesses. These contributed Pounds 6.3m to operating
profits, which improved overall by 13 per cent to Pounds 191.6m.
North American building products showed the strongest advance, as a result
of a cost reductions. Operating profits rose 34 per cent to Pounds 39.6m.
Fire protection improved by 19 per cent to Pounds 47.6m, while the European
building products operations contributed Pounds 69.1m against Pounds 59.3m.
The security division improved from Pounds 22.5m to Pounds 25.2m.
In line with its stated policy of seeking to improve the dividend cover to
about two times, Williams proposed a final payment of 7.75p. This leaves the
total dividend just 2 per cent higher at 12.75p. Earnings fell from 18.6p to
15.7p.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Owen &amp; Robinson price rises on reports of
stake acquisition move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Owen &amp; Robinson, the gold jewellery and sports footwear retailer,
rose 8p to 34p yesterday after a report that a stake in the group might be
taken by Mr Philip Green, the controversial former chairman and chief
executive of Amber Day, the discount retailer.
Mr Green said last night: 'At this moment, I have bought no shares.' It is
understood, however, that Mr Green has had talks with Mr Maurice Dwek, a
former chairman of Owen &amp; Robinson, who still owns 15.8 per cent of its
shares.
Mr Green declined to comment on any possible talks, but said: 'I always look
at interesting situations. If it's the right deal at the right time, I might
look at it.'
Mr Steve Foot, Owen &amp; Robinson's finance director, said of Mr Green: 'If
he's buying shares, he hasn't done so yet.'
Mr Green stepped down in September, 1992, from Amber Day, which has since
been renamed the WEW Group. He left with a Pounds 1.13m golden handshake
after a deluge of adverse press coverage was followed by results well below
analysts' expectations. Mr Green also received Pounds 7.6m from selling his
stake in the group.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Medeva chief goes as rise of 28% to Pounds
46m is shown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ian Gowrie-Smith, the entrepreneur who founded Medeva, the acquisitive
pharmaceuticals group, is resigning his executive position nine months after
a profit warning which halved the share price.
Mr Gowrie-Smith, managing director, and his long-time business partner Mr
David Lees, who is resigning as finance director to be succeeded by Mr
Dennis Millard, will continue to provide the group with 'acquisition
services' on a consultancy basis. Mr Gowrie-Smith will remain a
non-executive director.
The resignations came as Medeva announced a 28 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 46.1m for 1993.
In July it warned that profits would be about Pounds 10m lower than
analysts' expectations of Pounds 53m-Pounds 57m largely due to problems at
two US subsidiaries.
Sales rose 39 per cent to Pounds 200.4m on the back of organic growth but
excluding exchange rate movements of 20 per cent. Earnings fell 4 per cent
to 11.8p due partly to a higher tax charge. The final dividend is 1.8p
(1.5p) for a 2.7p (2.25p) total.
Mr Bernard Taylor, brought in as chairman in 1990, insisted that the
resignations were not linked to the problems the group encountered last
year. He denied there had been any pressure on the two to go.
Although it is an open secret that Mr Taylor found it hard to work with Mr
Gowrie-Smith, sources close to the company also insisted that the
resignations were voluntary.
Mr Gowrie-Smith said that he had approached Mr Taylor in April or May,
before the problems arose, asking to end his managerial role.
Both Mr Gowrie-Smith and Mr Lees will receive Pounds 30,000 in compensation
for loss of office and have been granted three-year consultancy agreements.
These provide for initial payments of Pounds 286,000 and Pounds 230,000 and
payments over the next three years totalling a minimum of Pounds 700,000 and
Pounds 400,000 respectively. Mr Gowrie-Smith received a salary of about
Pounds 310,000 last year, down about 25 per cent.
Mr Taylor revealed that the group pulled out of a potential deal after the
shares slumped from 216p to 116p on the profit warning but said it still
needed to make acquisitions. Mr Gowrie-Smith said it could afford to make a
Pounds 100m purchase without issuing more shares.
The shares added 7p to 155p yesterday.
COMMENT
The rather modest rise in Medeva's share price yesterday may reflect the
fact that Mr Gowrie-Smith's move was seen as only a matter of time. There
were also a few negatives with the figures, which were boosted by booming
flu vaccine sales, including a year delay in the important hepatitis B
vaccine programme. On forecasts for the current year of about Pounds 54m the
shares are now on a multiple of about 12.5. There is plenty of scope for
further recovery.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Of relationships and bottom lines - The
personal conflicts at the top of Saatchi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Charlie Scott, group chief executive of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, yesterday
described the past 18 months as the worst in his life. However, he considers
his struggle to reduce debts, restructure operations and install effective
management is now largely over.
As his statement accompanying the group's results yesterday said: 'All the
businesses remaining in the group are now profitable, and as trading
conditions in our core markets start to improve during 1994, I am confident
Saatchi will demonstrate the performance that our shareholders have the
right to expect.'
Whether or not his confidence is justified will depend, to a large extent,
on two factors. First, the Saatchi board will need to tackle the
embarrassing leaks about tension between Mr Maurice Saatchi, its chairman,
and Mr Scott.
Second, the revamped management, particularly in the US, will need to start
showing new business gains and evidence that it can reverse the decline in
market share which has been eroding revenues.
The relationship between Mr Scott and Mr Saatchi appeared to decline sharply
from the point when, in December, it was announced that Maurice's brother,
Charles, would step down as a director.
It was also decided that Saatchi's offices in Berkeley Square, in the West
End of London, would be vacated.
There followed rumours that the brothers were planning a buy-out and that
Maurice wanted to take over more of the running of the group. Now, a
compensation committee, headed by Sir Peter Walters, will examine Maurice's
five-year rolling contract, described by Mr Scott as 'not within the spirit
of the Cadbury guidelines'.
Says one Maurice supporter: 'He admits he has withdrawn a lot over the past
year, he had let things drift. He's left executive functions with the board
and he now believes that was a mistake.'
Maurice is said to feel that the 'beancounters' have failed to deliver their
promises on the financial side. Mr Scott will not be drawn on the subject,
but his supporters say that Maurice has yet to deliver on his part of the
bargain - bringing in new clients.
To blame Mr Scott for what continues to be a depressing picture is unjust,
according to the heads of other agencies.
Said the chief executive of one large group yesterday: 'One has to remember
it was Maurice Saatchi who talked of bidding for the Midland Bank. He was
also one of the architects of the huge, sprawling, shambling empire. To
begin to blame Charlie Scott, who seems to have done a fair job of
stabilising the business, seems to me to be desperately unfair. Indeed,
there wouldn't be a business without Charlie Scott.'
The head of another large agency pointed to the 'nervousness and confusion'
resulting from the conflict, which is being felt by staff at the Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi agency network, which shares the holding company's name. There is
concern that some of the bad press will have an effect on relationships with
clients.
And it is the relationship with clients - particularly potential clients -
that will have most influence on the bottom line. According to Mr Scott, the
group has lost about 1.4 percentage points of market share over the past
three years - worth about Pounds 50m a year in revenue - from the 20 per
cent of the global market it holds.
The problem is largely in the US, where big contracts to have been lost
recently include the Chrysler and Helene Curtis accounts, worth Pounds 30m
in revenue this year.
Fixed costs are high. The staff of about 11,000 account for more than 60 per
cent of revenue. By growing revenue, Mr Scott is aiming to get this down to
the 55 per cent or so enjoyed by competitors Interpublic and Omnicom - he
calculates that at least half of any extra revenue will flow straight to the
bottom line.
Mr Scott calculates that over the past four years, and in particular over
the past two, about 70 per cent of the managers he describes as the 'key
drivers' towards these ends have been replaced or transferred.
'For the first time since I joined the company, we now have quality CEOs in
all our operating companies. These people have been selected for their
ability to grow the business,' he said.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Restructuring aids Emess recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Emess, the UK's largest lighting company, yesterday announced the reversal
of two years of losses with pre-tax profits of Pounds 4m for 1993, against a
Pounds 10.6m deficit in 1992.
The result was mainly attributable to improved performances from the US and
German subsidiaries, and the impact of an aggressive restructuring
programme.
During 1993, group staffing levels were reduced by 20 per cent to 2,000, as
businesses were streamlined and unprofitable product lines cut. Sales per
employee rose from Pounds 54,000 to Pounds 64,000 in the year.
Turnover was Pounds 131.2m, against Pounds 130.3m from continuing operations
in 1992.
Mr Michael Meyer, chairman, said: 'I am more encouraged by prospects for our
businesses in 1994 than at any time during the past four years'. He added
that trading in the first two months was ahead of budget.'
Operating profit was Pounds 6m (Pounds 1m loss). The UK operations
contributed Pounds 5.9m (Pounds 0.1m) and they have seen a strong start to
the current year.
Brilliant, the German business, had lost Pounds 2m in 1992, but contributed
a marginal profit last year, after staff reorganisation. Also its US
subsidiary returned to the black during 1993. Net debt at the year-end was
up from Pounds 20m to Pounds 26m, because of the repurchase of Pounds 11m of
preference shares. However, average debt for the year was lower, and
interest payments fell from Pounds 3.6m to Pounds 2m.
The company has recommended an unchanged final dividend of 0.1p, despite the
fact that net earnings of Pounds 2.4m were not sufficient to cover
preference dividends of Pounds 3.9m.
Fully diluted earnings per share amounted to 1.5p (7.2p losses). The shares
closed 2 1/2 p higher yesterday at 32p.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Flotation values Maid at Pounds 89.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Maid, the on-line business information supplier, were priced at
110p yesterday valuing the group at Pounds 89.1m - well below market
expectations fuelled by the company and its financial advisers.
Some 11.5m shares in the nine-year-old group have been placed firm with
institutional investors by Hoare Govett, stockbroker to the issue, on behalf
of the company.
The new shares represent a little more than 14 per cent of the shares in
issue following the placing.
Earlier the company had been confidently predicting that the issue,
underwritten by Hill Samuel, would place a minimum value of Pounds 100m on
the group and provide it with about Pounds 16m in net new funds. A placing
price of up to 150p a share had been mooted.
However the flotation has been dogged with controversy, with some analysts
and fund managers expressing concern and surprise at Maid's proposed stock
market valuation and lack of established track record.
As a result the company scaled down its expectations for the flotation price
and has abandoned plans to spend Pounds 4m on a building to consolidate the
group's UK operations.
In addition, a number of existing BES investors in the company who had been
expected to sell shares in the placing, have decided to wait.
Nevertheless, both the company and its advisers insisted that the placing
had been a success and defended the pricing while blaming competitors for
'the background noise' surrounding the issue.
Mr Stephen Aulsebrook of Hill Samuel, described the 110p price as 'very
attractive', and said the placing had been well received by most
institutional investors.
'We set out to raise enough money for the company to move forward and we
have done that,' he said, adding, 'it is a hell of an achievement for a
company which, as some people have pointed out, made only Pounds 600,000 in
profits last year.'
Mr Daniel Wagner, Maid's 30-year-old founder and chief executive, said he
was 'thrilled to bits' with the placing while acknowledging that market
conditions had resulted in the issue having to be priced 'more
competitively'.
He said the new funds, while somewhat less than anticipated, would enable
Maid to continue to develop its product portfolio, including a planned
version of Maid for Windows version of it's software.
He dismissed the company's critics who have questioned various aspects of
its operations, including its dependence on primary business information
providers.
'This is a brilliant business and we are going to prove it in the market,'
Mr Wagner said.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: B&amp;J puts pressure on bankers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brown &amp; Jackson, the discount retailer which has raised Pounds 39m from
shareholders since 1992, yesterday sought to put pressure on its bankers by
warning it could not continue trading unless working capital facilities of
Pounds 14m were agreed soon.
The company's shares fell by 3 3/4 to 2 3/4 p as it revealed substantially
larger than expected losses for 1993 and warned of the difficulties in
negotiations with its bankers.
If working capital facilities for the next 12 months are not secured soon,
the Pounds 6m sale and leaseback transaction which was due to be completed
yesterday cannot go ahead.
Analysts held out little hope of a resolution, at least through the banks,
and said that the group had been expected to make further losses this year.
'B&amp;J has just passed its cash peak,' said Mr William Cullum, analyst with
brokers Panmure Gordon. 'so the banks will get out what they put in.'
The announcement was also a high risk gamble, he suggested. 'If you were a
supplier would you now want to supply B&amp;J? This sort of public disagreement
could be self-fulfilling,' Mr Cullum said.
Mr Ian Gray, the chief executive appointed following a rescue rights issue
in 1992, said the group had 'adequate trading facilities today'. He was
confident that the company would be able to trade until a solution was
found. 'We have a number of options,' he said.
One of the options was investment by a foreign discount retailer, he said.
The group was in discussions with both the retailer and the banks.
Midland Bank is believed to have decided not to provide further facilities
in light of the group's most recent results and its past trading record.
Brown &amp; Jackson unveiled full year losses of Pounds 12.7m (Pounds 6.6m) on
turnover of Pounds 170m (Pounds 167m), against average expectations of an
Pounds 8m deficit.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Saatchi back to black with Pounds 19m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, one of the world's largest advertising groups, yesterday
reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 19.2m for the year ended December 31
1993, compared with a loss of Pounds 595.1m in 1992, writes Diane Summers.
The figure was in line with City expectations, which were revised downwards
by about Pounds 6m in December, after a profits warning from the group. The
shares closed down 1p at 141p.
Saatchi hailed the results as a return to profitability for the first time
since 1988. However, the 1992 figure included a Pounds 600m write-off of
goodwill associated with US acquisitions made in the 1980s.
Revenue from continuing operations rose 10 per cent, from Pounds 731m to
Pounds 806m, but the rise was accounted for by currency movements, said
Saatchi. Excluding these, revenue for 1993 was flat.
Similarly, operating costs appeared to rise from Pounds 713.8m to Pounds
776.6m. But once constant exchange rates were applied and severance,
property credits and disposals excluded, costs dropped by 1 per cent.
The group warned that revenues in 1994 will be lower than for 1993. 'The
revenue outlook for 1994 is difficult. We have lost two big clients, in
neither case due to the quality of our work, and clients remain cautious
about their planned level of expenditure, particularly in Europe.'
Trading profits increased by 8 per cent to Pounds 36.8m (Pounds 34.2m).
Severance costs of Pounds 19.1m were charged and Pounds 7.3m surplus
property provisions were credited. Excluding currency movements and
exceptionals trading profits increased by 1 per cent.
Profit margins, excluding exceptional items, increased from 6.1 per cent to
6.3 per cent in 1993. Mr Charlie Scott, group chief executive, admitted that
the group was not on course to meet his target of 10 per cent margins by
1995. Meeting the target was dependent on revenues increasing in line with
inflation, and that had not happened during 1993, he said.
Profit attributable to shareholders totalled Pounds 7.3m (loss of Pounds
613.7m), with earnings per share of 3.7p (losses of 362.8p). No dividend
will be paid.
After taking into account a Pounds 73m rights issue in June and currency
movements, average net debt during December 1993 was Pounds 112m, a
reduction of Pounds 82m. Analysts forecast pre-tax profits of about Pounds
30m for 1994, with earnings per share of 7p.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Wolseley shares soar on 83% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Wolseley, the world's biggest supplier of heating and plumbing
equipment, soared by 69p to 971p yesterday as the group again surprised the
City with a sharp rise in profits. Pre-tax profits for the six months to
January 31 rose 83 per cent from Pounds 47.6m to Pounds 87m. Analysts had
expected Pounds 70m.
Mr Jeremy Lancaster, chairman and managing director, attributed the rise to
increased activity in building distribution in the UK and US, coupled with
the contributions from acquisitions. He said the company continued to apply
best practice, adding: 'If you have a formula that seems to work, then it
seems advisable to press on.'
Turnover rose from Pounds 1.15bn to Pounds 1.54bn, including Pounds 92.5m
from acquisitions.
The contribution from Erb Lumber, a US distributor of lumber and associated
products bought for Pounds 51.1m last August, had exceeded expectations. Erb
accounted for most of the Pounds 4.67m contribution by acquisitions to total
US building distribution trading profit of Pounds 34.8m, up from Pounds
18.3m. US profits included a Pounds 4.3m currency gain.
Turnover from continuing US operations advanced from Pounds 542.4m to Pounds
710.6m. Sales at Familian in California were static, but its trading loss
was 'close to being eliminated'.
But Wolseley warned that as the US house building recovery had started by
July last year, it was 'most unlikely' that the rate of growth would be
maintained in the second half.
Turnover for building distribution in Europe rose from Pounds 482.2m to
Pounds 549.4m. Trading profits increased from Pounds 22.8m to Pounds 35m.
The group said UK sales were 12 per cent ahead while Brossette, the French
arm, had raised sales by 7 per cent.
European manufacturing and other activities raised turnover from Pounds
120.4m to Pounds 190.5m. The division's trading profits jumped from Pounds
51.8m to Pounds 88.7m, including a contribution of Pounds 7.5m from
Enertech, the Swedish oil and gas burner manufacturer acquired last April.
At the end of the half, the group had a 'small positive cash balance',
mainly from the Pounds 55m raised by last August's share placing. Earnings
per share were 72 per cent ahead at 22.09p (12.86p), and the interim
dividend was raised from 3.55p to 4.72p.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Break-up threat to pension fund fantasy league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is the annual results season for the UK's occupational pension schemes.
Trustees are poring over sheets of opaque investment numbers, the two main
measuring agencies are about to publish their aggregated returns and fund
managers are preparing variously to boast or to make excuses.
But as the annual league table exercise nears its climax, there is a strong
feeling that the game is changing. Britain's unique focus on a shrinking
universe of so-called balanced managers who are engaged in the tweaking of
near-consensus strategies may be shifting.
As pension plans become ever more mature - that is, they move towards a
position where they will pay out more in benefits than they receive in
contributions - their risk tolerance grows smaller and their need to match
their assets in a customised way to their individual liabilities becomes
greater.
Yet if the old order is going out, it is retreating in some style. According
to provisional figures from one of the measurers, Caps, the median fund
returned 29 per cent last year, a result only beaten once (in 1989) in the
past decade. The five-year average annual rate of return for the median fund
now works out at 16.7 per cent, a long way above assumed actuarial returns
which are based on a small margin over growth in average employee earnings.
Certain managers achieved exceptional returns last year, such as Schroders
with almost 33 per cent. Morgan Grenfell did well too, and among the smaller
contenders Newton hit 35 per cent. The market leader Mercury Asset
Management keeps its figures to itself - there is a wide dispersion among
its hundreds of client funds - but Gartmore and Phillips &amp; Drew Fund
Management both had unexciting years: Gartmore was pulled just above the
median at the end of the year by Hong Kong but PDFM stayed just below after
its bearish dash for cash proved ill-timed in the final quarter (though it
will have enjoyed this year so far).
But with equity and bond markets booming worldwide the value added by the
average manager does not appear to have been substantial. No great strategic
initiatives appear to have been taken in 1993. According to Caps, exposure
to UK equities drifted by 2 percentage points to 58 per cent of the average
portfolio, while overseas equities expanded by 1.5 points to 24.5 per cent.
Overseas bonds at 6 per cent scarcely budged, nor did UK fixed interest
bonds at 3.5 per cent (the government's Pounds 50bn gilt-edged selling
programme passed pension funds by).
The biggest current bets appear to be in international equity allocations,
where the US and Japan together accounted for only 30 per cent of overseas
equities at the end of 1993 although they represented 65 per cent of the
world ex-UK capitalisation. Many managers, however, have recently been going
back into Japan and moderating the extreme exposure to continental Europe
and the Pacific Rim (ex-Japan). The latter two regions accounted for 65 per
cent of pension fund overseas equity holdings, but for only 24 per cent of
the world ex-UK market.
Despite these tilted weightings, the present allocations of UK pension funds
can be almost wholly explained by the passive cumulative impact of past
returns. Instead of targeting an asset allocation and then periodically
rebalancing (by selling assets that have outperformed and buying others that
have underperformed) the managers have let their winners run. That may sound
reasonable but it ignores the accumulation of risk.
Now the balanced managers have reached an 82 per cent exposure to equities.
Some pension plans such as that of British Rail are beginning to buckle
under the strain and set up dedicated bond portfolios which are better
matched to their ever-shortening liability structure.
More generally, the fully-discretionary mandate is being phased out in
favour of benchmarks, usually set in terms of a combination of indices (or
for a specialist mandate, only one). This process is rapidly turning the
general performance table into a kind of fantasy league, which will have to
be replaced by many different specialist league tables.
It will be a whole lot more rational but a whole lot less fun.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Mirror Group jumps back with Pounds 132m: Recovery of money
for plundered pension funds - Dividend to be resumed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mirror Group Newspapers yesterday celebrated its independence from
administrators and the legacy of the late Robert Maxwell by announcing
higher than expected pre-tax profits of Pounds 131.9m.
The turnround from a loss of Pounds 88.7m in 1992 included net exceptional
gains of Pounds 58.1m, compared with charges of Pounds 121.2m. The group was
able to release provisions of Pounds 60.8m as more money was recovered for
plundered pension funds.
Sir Robert Clark, chairman, said 1993 had been 'a year of success and
transformation for Mirror Group Newspapers. Every aspect of the business has
come under scrutiny.'
Trading profits rose 19 per cent to Pounds 115.9m on turnover up 2 per cent
at Pounds 476.1m for the 53 weeks to January 2. Profits before tax and
exceptionals reached Pounds 73.8m, against Pounds 32.5m.
'We have more than doubled the profits at the same time as we have gained
our independence,' said Mr David Montgomery, chief executive. This week has
also seen MGN move its titles to new headquarters in Canary Wharf in
London's Docklands.
Later this week, possibly today, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, is expected to rule on the bid by a consortium which includes MGN
for Newspaper Publishing, owner of The Independent and Independent on
Sunday.
MGN said it planned to resume dividend payments this year. Earnings per
share, excluding exceptionals, rose from 5.8p to 15.1p.
Year-end net debt fell from Pounds 392m to Pounds 335m and the company said
it intended to renegotiate borrowing terms with its banks.
Savings included Pounds 16m in production and editorial, partly offset by
Pounds 7m in extra newsprint and promotional costs. Some 600 jobs were cut
last year, bringing the workforce down to 2,900. Another 200 jobs are still
to go.
Despite pressure on circulation, particularly on the Daily Mirror which
faces tough competition from the cut-price Sun, circulation revenue fell
only marginally from Pounds 301.9m to Pounds 298.8m and advertising revenue
rose from Pounds 154.2m to Pounds 169.1m.
Mr Montgomery estimated the cover price cuts at The Sun and The Times were
costing News International Pounds 1m a week.
Circulations of the three main MGN titles - the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror
and People - are all declining but they are holding on to market share.
Between September 1993 and February 1994, according to ABC figures, The
People lost 3.35 per cent to 1.99m. But three years ago the rate of decline
was 15 per cent. In the six months to February, the Sunday Mirror lost 3.79
per cent to 2.57m, while the Daily Mirror dropped 7.3 per cent to 2.52m.
MGN shares rose 7p to close at 197p yesterday.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Emotional onslaught against Rover sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rover group, the last British-owned volume car producer, will officially
pass into the ownership of BMW, the German carmaker, on Friday, but only
after bitter opposition was expressed yesterday by small shareholders in
British Aerospace.
The takeover, which will create the world's largest specialist carmaker,
cleared the two final hurdles yesterday, when it was approved by both the
European Commission and BAe shareholders.
Shareholders attending BAe's extraordinary general meeting voted 111 to 42
yesterday on a show of hands to reject the deal, but it was passed
overwhelmingly by proxy votes of 119.6m to 2.9m in favour of the BAe board.
BMW is paying Pounds 800m cash and taking over Pounds 200m of net debt and
Pounds 700m of off-balance sheet funding to purchase an 80 per cent stake in
Rover.
The BAe board has faced the unremitting hostility of small shareholders to
the sale. Outside the meeting a handful of demonstrators with one
23-year-old Land Rover turned up to protest, armed with a couple of union
flags and two placards declaring 'Sale of Rover Industrial Dunkirk' and
'European Union means death for British industry'.
Inside the meeting the atmosphere was much tougher, and Mr John Cahill, the
departing BAe chairman, floundered as he was bombarded with fierce criticism
and emotional outbursts. Not one shareholder rose to support the sale of
Rover.
The BAe board was accused of 'selling the family silver' and of damaging
Britain's relations with Japan. The sale of Rover to Germany was called
'offensive' and 'objectionable'.
The integrity of the board was attacked, it was accused of telling 'half
truths and untruths', of selling the wrong business, and of failing to win
written guarantees for keeping Rover jobs and Rover's technology base in the
UK.
There was loud ironic applause when Mr Cahill was told, 'you are on your way
back home to the US with a Pounds 3.5m bonus', and the BAe chairman
struggled to control the meeting.
Why did BAe have to increase its borrowing limits when it was receiving
Pounds 800m in cash, wondered one shareholder. 'If I sell half the family
silver, I reduce my indebtedness, not increase it.'
But after two hours of rancour, the BAe proxy votes ensured that by the end
of the week Britain will no longer own a volume carmaker.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Regulators move on OTC derivatives risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
British and American securities regulators yesterday announced a joint
effort aimed at limiting risks to the international financial system posed
by the explosive growth of over-the-counter derivative instruments.
These instruments are not traded on exchanges, have no official market
price, and are tailor-made to suit the needs of individual counterparties.
Regulators are concerned that securities firms have controls to help them
account for and understand risks they take and to ensure adequate capital is
set aside.
The agreement is between the UK Securities and Investments Board, and two US
bodies, the Securities Exchange Commission and the Commodities and Futures
Trading Commission.
'Everyone feels there is no sense in trying to regulate this product,' said
Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the SIB.
'What we want is to ensure that securities firms have the capital base, the
controls and the understanding of the risk.'
The move stemmed from talks last year between the SEC and the SIB and
follows a similar agreement between US and UK banking firms.
Mr Carter Beese, a commissioner at the SEC said: 'Over the past year there
has been a very high level of co-operation between banking and securities
authorities in the US.'
In addition to promoting internal management controls, the SEC and the SIB
want to ensure that firms understand how 'severe market conditions' affect
the value of their securities, that there be a common approach to the
accounting recognition, measurement and disclosure of positions and that
there be enhanced information sharing.
Mrs Barbara Holum, acting chairman of the CFTC, said the near-collapse of MG
Corp, the US arm of the German group Metallgesellschaft, due to oil and gas
derivatives dealings, underscored the urgency of such an agreement.
Over-the-counter derivative traders gave cautious endorsement to the pact,
saying it parallelled the agenda of international banking regulators.
'We had been concerned that the securities regulators might be moving in a
different direction,' on issues like transaction netting, said Mr Joseph
Baumann, President of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association,
and director of global derivatives trading for Citibank.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Rail groups face Pounds 500m leasing charge for trains:
Treasury likely to offset extra cost with subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rail companies that take over British Rail's passenger operations will pay
about Pounds 500m a year to lease the trains they will need.
This sum is in addition to the Pounds 2.2bn which the government said last
month the rail companies would have to pay for the right to run their trains
on the national rail network.
The government's programme to privatise BR involves creating three rolling
stock leasing companies, which will take over BR's existing trains and also
buy new ones for leasing to train operators. The operating companies will
not be required to lease their rolling stock but most are expected to do so.
Details of the leasing arrangements have been eagerly awaited by potential
bidders for BR franchises, which are expected to go on sale next year.
Negotiations between the Department of Transport, the Treasury, BR and
Hambros, the merchant bank that is advising on the rolling stock companies,
are continuing. The government is keen to establish a commercial regime for
pricing the leasing deals but this is proving difficult in the absence of an
existing market for rolling stock leases. Treasury approval for a leasing
regime has yet to be given.
In theory, the Pounds 500m leasing charge will not prove a burden to the
rail companies because it will be matched by an increase in the Treasury
subsidy. However, any increase in the subsidy requirement could demotivate
managers, some of whom have already expressed concern at the track charges
they will have to pay.
Potential bidders for rail franchises are concerned that very few details
have been released about the rolling stock companies less than three weeks
ahead of the formal creation of a devolved railway network on April 1.
Details of the leasing agreements were due to be announced to BR's operating
companies at a meeting in Reading earlier this month but the presentation
was called off at the last minute.
Appointments to the boards of the three rolling stock companies - two of
which will be based in London, with the third in Sheffield - have progressed
slowly and only one managing director designate is understood to have been
appointed.
The Department of Transport expects to reach an agreement on the details of
the leases by June and to have concluded agreements with the present BR
operating companies by September or October.
No detailed agreement has yet been reached on how the leasing charges will
be allocated to the 24 BR operating companies to be franchised. The charges
are unlikely to mirror the allocation of track charges because they will
depend on the type and age of the rolling stock in use.

FT  16 MAR 94 / UK seeks Brussels' help on car sales dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government acknow-ledged yesterday that it was backing away from a
fight with carmakers, who have refused to comply with Monopolies and Mergers
Commission recommendations made more than two years ago aimed at giving
consumers a better deal.
Instead it is hoping that the results of a review of the way cars are
distributed and sold throughout Europe, currently being undertaken by the
European Commission, will remove the need for it to take any further action.
The announcement by Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, provoked
an angry response from Mr Derek Prentice, assistant director of the
Consumers' Association.
'It is quite staggering that the government has not been able to reach an
agreement with manufacturers on the implementation of the MMC
recommendations on the supply of new cars,' he said.
'The MMC decision itself was weak and feeble in our view - more needed to be
done. The very fact that the government has been unable to persuade the car
industry to make the minimal changes recommended by the MMC is an appalling
reflection on the anti-competitive nature of the UK car industry.'
The MMC's report on car distribution and sales was instigated by the Office
of Fair Trading after consumer complaints that UK car prices were
excessively high compared with those of some continental European markets.
It found evidence of monopolies at work but concluded that they were not, of
themselves, necessarily against consumers' interests.
However, the report did identify a number of restrictions imposed by
carmakers on the activities of their dealers - such as limiting their
freedom to advertise outside their own sales territories - which it felt did
operate against the public interest, and recommended their removal.
However, the government hopes that many or all of the MMC's recommendations
will be imposed by the EC as part of its conditions for renewing the 'block
exemption' from EU competition rules under which carmakers are currently
allowed to restrict car sales through exclusive dealerships. The exemption
expires on June 30 1995.
The UK's 7,000-strong network of franchised car dealers, whose own position
would have been strengthened by enforcement of the MMC's recommendations,
last night expressed resigned disappointment at the move.

FT  16 MAR 94 / G7 ministers back free trade and labour flexibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DETROIT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial nations agreed
yesterday that free trade, labour market flexibility and a stable economic
environment were essential to tackle the persistent unemployment that has
afflicted all their economies.
However, the unprecedented two-day conference in Detroit produced 'no single
solution, no one idea or action that will work for every country,' said Mr
Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary and meeting chairman.
The conference yielded a consensus that countries must balance the right
macroeconomic policies with measures to attack longer-term structural
job-lessness.
'Structural reforms can make our labour markets and employment systems far
more adaptable to change. We need, carefully and in our own ways, to pursue
policies to take down barriers and to strengthen our markets,' Mr Bentsen
said.
Ministers agreed on the need to improve the education, training and skills
of their workforces, but Mr Bentsen warned that the G7 countries could
produce all the highly trained workers they wanted, 'but it does no good
unless we've created the climate in which the corporate world has jobs
waiting for them'.
The Detroit conference's conclusions will form the starting point for the
'sherpas' preparing July's summit meeting of G7 leaders in Naples. But
beneath the apparent harmony, divisions emerged, particularly on the
relative importance of government and the private sector.
'I won't say that there were sharp exchanges, but there were some courteous
sharp disagreements,' said Mr Robert Reich, the US labour secretary.
Among the most radical ideas that received support was a suggestion to allow
employees to work a fixed number of hours in the year, rather than each
week, allowing greater flexibility both for employers to deal with seasonal
variations and for workers to plan their own free time.
'At a time when modern technology gives us more and more flexibility, why
should work time still be planned as it was at the beginning of the
industrial revolution?' asked Mr Henning Christophersen, European Commission
vice-president.
Mr Bentsen said ministers had agreed to ask the Paris-based Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development to study the relationship between
productivity, technology and job creation and to expand a study already
under way to improve statistics on joblessness in the industrial world.

FT  16 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Mirror Group
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mirror Group Newspapers is in something of a bind. Tabloid newspaper sales
are in long-term decline with the Sun's price offensive sharpening the Daily
Mirror's falls. MGN is therefore keen to diversify. But with lowly-rated
shares and gearing of 73 per cent, the group is severely disadvantaged
against rivals boasting cash in hand and high-priced paper. MGN's proposed
alliance with Newspaper Publishing may yield some cost savings but the deal
remains marginal. The ingenuity of MGN's managers in unearthing expansion
opportunities will be fully tested.
At least MGN can keep profits moving by running its existing businesses more
efficiently. Trading margins - excluding restructuring charges - have
already risen to 24 per cent. But further gains should come from moving to
Canary Wharf and improved utilisation rates at its print plants. Advertising
revenue has been growing strongly as a result of some smarter newspaper
supplements and the general market bounce.
Arguably, MGN has been sensible in not responding more aggressively to price
wars. But the 1 per cent fall in circulation revenue suggests it is now
being badly burnt by the Sun. The real worry comes if the Mirror's decline
endangers its advertising rate card. With such doubts in mind, one can only
admire the prescience of the administrators in placing their stake last
September. Having outperformed the media sector by 44 per cent in the six
months before the placing, MGN has underperformed by 13 per cent in the six
months since.

FT  16 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: US economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's US producer price data confirmed the Federal Reserve's view that
America does not have an inflation problem. But industrial production and
capacity utilisation figures show why the bond market thinks it may be about
to get one. By most calculations, the US has closed the output gap which
opened during the recession. With capacity constraints now at their tightest
since 1989, further growth above the long-term trend will probably stir
inflation.
Growth may, however, moderate automatically - last year's fall in the
savings ratio is not sustainable and the recent rise in bond yields will
slow the housing market. But since most consumers will sit tight with
low-cost, fixed-rate mortgages, rising yields are not as effective a brake
as falling yields are a stimulus. And while the Fed's initial increase in
short-term interest rates has had a powerful psychological impact on
markets, its effect on the real economy is small. If the Fed becomes
concerned about the pace of expansion, it will have to push up short rates
more decisively.
That worry will probably keep the bond market on edge over the next few
months. Once the Fed acts, however, longer yields may stabilise and fall if
the threat of rising inflationary expectations recedes. Shares have remained
resilient despite the high anxiety of the bond market. That decoupling may
continue. If the rising output and falling unit wage cost figures are any
guide, there is a strong profits recovery out there for someone.

FT  16 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Williams Holdings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Slowly but surely Williams Holdings is digging itself out of the hole in
which it fell after its Racal bid failed. Full-year results show a rapid
advance of operating profit in the second half thanks in large measure to a
broader distribution base in the US. Cash generation is also improving with
Pounds 47m left over after capital spending, interest, tax and dividend
payments have been met. Just the same, in marking the shares up by a quarter
since late November, the market may have become carried away. The balance
sheet does not look strong enough to sustain much by way of cash
acquisitions. More paper might well meet resistance, especially since
dividend growth is likely to be pedestrian.
A significant part of the cash-flow improvement came from a squeeze on
working capital, continued restraint of capital spending, which is less than
half its peak in 1989, and a virtual end to spending of restructuring
provisions. Williams now needs to generate cash from its basic operations.
The presumption is that there will be a large beneficial effect from
increased volumes once recovery gets under way.
Yet Williams still does not seem to have much scope to raise prices. Higher
interest rates in the US and tax increases in the UK do not seem
particularly conducive to volume growth. There may be some years of dividend
restraint before Williams meets its target of two times cover. In the
meantime Hanson is on a higher yield and BTR seems likely to offer faster
earnings recovery.

FT  16 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Wolseley builds higher
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wolseley has a habit of exceeding market expectations. Yesterday's 8 per
cent rise in the shares following the release of half-year figures is a case
in point. The company's reticence is partly the cause. More segmental
information and an interim cash flow statement, for example, might help
investors form a clearer view of what the future holds. The Stock Exchange's
new disclosure guidelines are certainly no justification for clamming up.
While the going is good shareholders will doubtless forgive, but such
shyness cuts both ways. Wolseley's creditable history of outperformance is
punctuated by some uncomfortably sharp corrections.
Yesterday's interim statement gives no immediate cause for concern. True,
Wolseley will not enjoy the conditions of the 1980s unless the housing
market is stoked into another frenzy. With inflation low, neither can it
count on stock profits to boost margins. But the 12 per cent increase in UK
sales shows how sensitive Wolseley's distribution business is to even a
modest upturn in building activity. Since profits from European distribution
rose by more than 50 per cent - with presumably little cheer coming from
France - the operational gearing is clear.
The acquisition of Brossette in France two years ago might also provide the
foundation for a wider European distribution network. If Wolseley can avoid
tripping on the acquisition trail there should be growth as well as recovery
to come. While the recent run-up in the shares argues for caution, that
prospect leaves long-term holders with little incentive to sell.

FT  16 MAR 94 / More flexible, and less arrogant friend: The outlook for a
UK-based computer company in a cut-throat marketplace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International Computers, the UK-based computer company, used to epitomise
arrogance and insularity. Even 'International' in the company's name begged
an invidious comparison with International Business Machines, the world's
largest computer company.
Stories of its conceit abounded. The chief salesman for a region, it was
said, would put up in the best hotel and announce he would be available that
evening in the parlour to take customers' orders for computers.
Since its acquisition, first by the UK telecommunications company STC in
1984 and then by Fujitsu, Japan's leading computer maker, in 1990, that
arrogance has evaporated. 'Today we are humbler and nimbler,' says Mr Peter
Bonfield, ICL chairman and chief executive.
Mr Koshiro 'Kit' Kitazato, Fujitsu's man in ICL's headquarters in Putney,
west London, is charged with co-ordination between the Japanese computer
giant and its UK-based subsidiary. He says ICL has learnt reliability from
Fujitsu, while Fujitsu has learnt flexibility from ICL.
Fujitsu set several strategic objectives at the time of the takeover. ICL
would be autonomous, operating at arm's length from its parent. It would
retain its European base, seek maximum commercial co-operation with Fujitsu
and, eventually, float on the London Stock Exchange.
The first few conditions have been fulfilled; the recession has delayed the
flotation. Both companies agree they should work more closely together to
share research and development, and marketing costs.
There have been some positive developments: ICL's new mid-range computers
are the first to be sold under the two companies' names; a pioneering
trainee exchange scheme is under way; the two groups are collaborating on
check-out systems for supermarkets; ICL's office software has been rewritten
to be marketed in Japan.
Despite these achievements, ICL's 1993 results, scheduled for release today,
will not be exciting. Turnover will be higher than last year's Pounds 2.5bn,
but pre-tax profits are expected to be well below the Pounds 38.6m recorded
for 1992. Profitability has been on the slide since 1989, when ICL made
Pounds 148.6m before tax. The 1993 figure represents little more than
break-even, though it is respectable in an industry undergoing global
restructuring.
ICL's top management is taking steps to safeguard the group's profitability.
Earlier this year, the company raised Pounds 100m through a rights issue
wholly taken up by Fujitsu - the first time the UK company had turned to its
parent for funds.
The issue reflects the group's pessimism over short-term prospects in the
computer marketplace, as the industry moves towards low-cost, low-margin
operating systems based on common standards.
Cash is one bulwark against a highly competitive market; an increasingly
efficient and lean operation is another. Mr Bonfield points to the steady
decline in the group's overheads. In 1987 operating expenses as a percentage
of turnover were 26.8 per cent; in 1992 the figure was 22.8 per cent and it
is expected to have fallen further in 1993. The company employs about 25,000
and is cutting jobs at about 5 per cent a year.
The reason for ICL's drive for economies is the relentless decline in gross
profit margin. Standing at 47 per cent in 1987, it is now less than 35 per
cent as the shift to lower-cost systems continues.
Nevertheless, ICL remains the only consistently profitable broad-based
computer manufacturer headquartered in Europe; worldwide, it is one of the
few traditional computer companies not floundering in red ink. By
comparison, Siemens Nixdorf of Germany and Olivetti of Italy are losing
money; and Groupe Bull of France is dependent on repeated restructuring
grants from the French government.
Mr Bonfield's reputation is high, both with Fujitsu and the industry at
large. He was recently asked by Mr Martin Bangemann, European Union
commissioner for industry and telecommunications, to join the High Level
Group on Information Technology, set up to consider the impact of
information technology on Europe. This is an indication that ICL has
restored its Euro credentials after being bundled out of high-level European
policy meetings following the Fujitsu takeover.
But restoring adequate profitability has proved more difficult. Though it
still manufactures mainframe computers, more than 50 per cent of ICL's
revenues come from the services sector. Competitors now include services
companies, such as Electronic Data Systems (EDS), and personal computer
makers, such as Compaq, as well as its traditional rivals, IBM, Unisys and
Digital Equipment.
According to Input, a US consultancy which tracks the computing services
business, ICL's improvement in market share in services ranks it fourth in
Europe behind the US companies Microsoft, Andersen Consulting and EDS.
The company has been split into 26 semi-autonomous businesses, each with
profit and loss responsibilities. There are three groups: industry systems,
including countries such as France and Portugal, under Mr Richard
Livesey-Haworth;
services, including Workplace Technologies and Sorbus Europe, the
maintenance company ICL owns with Bell Atlantic, under Mr Paul Whitwam;
and technology businesses, exemplified by Design to Distribution, ICL's
manufacturing consultancy, under Mr Ninian Eadie.
These changes, made over the past year, are evidence that the company is
going through a second significant restructuring. The first took place more
than a decade ago when, under Mr Robb Wilmot, ICL forged a technological
alliance with Fujitsu and pioneered the shift to standard systems. That was
when ICL abandoned cherished notions of setting the technological agenda and
accepted that it would have to buy its technology from the best sources.
Despite what many saw as the dead hand of STC, ICL prospered during the
buoyant economy of the late 1980s.
But both ICL and STC were aware the company needed an owner with deeper
pockets and greater commitment to the information technology business than
STC. The solution proved to be Fujitsu. It bought the company just before
the US and western Europe entered recession. At the same time, the cost of
computer hardware fell sharply, helped by a fierce price war between
personal computer manufacturers.
ICL's survival is a consequence of a flexibility uncommon in large
companies: 'In storms we are quite quick up the rigging, even if the planks
are leaking,' Mr Livesey-Haworth says wryly.
Much of this flexibility comes from a trio of acquisitions: Datachecker, a
US retail automation company which is the cornerstone of ICL's ambitions as
a global retail systems company; Nokia Data, the Finnish personal computer
company, which ICL bought in 1992; and Technology, the UK's largest personal
computer distributor.
Datachecker, as ICL's senior managers recall, was a case study in how not to
manage an acquisition. The company sent in its own manager and accountants
who ran rough-shod over local management. Sensitivities were bruised, so the
assimilation took longer and cost more than envisaged.
When ICL acquired Nokia Data, it was determined not to make the same
mistake. PC operations were consolidated in Scandinavia. The chief impact,
however, was cultural, a pattern repeated with the acquisition of
Technology. 'We needed a shot of the faster-moving PC culture,' Mr Eadie
says.
So what is ICL's future? It is likely to remain medium sized; it is unlikely
to make more money this year than in 1993, as Mr Bonfield sees no
improvement in the market. He believes, however, that ICL's reorganisation
will be complete this year. Largely freed from debt through the rights issue
and from restructuring charges, the company should return to significant
profitability in 1995, he predicts. This could mean profits eventually
reaching 5 to 6 per cent of revenues.
The worry now is not complacency, but battle fatigue: 'We drive this company
hard, but it's the only way to do it,' Mr Bonfield says. Mr Keith Todd,
finance director and chief strategist, agrees: 'We have gone through world
war three, but we cannot relax. The fight goes on.'

Whether or not Whitewater is more than an affair, it has clearly gripped the
imagination of London's stockbrokers. In less than a week various bits of
Warburgs, James Capel and UBS have sent out research with the same heading -
Whitewater Rafting.
Hey guys, let's show a bit more creativity. In an effort to raise the
standard of headline writing among City stockbrokers, Observer is offering a
bottle of the finest malt for the most original Whitewater headline on a

FT  16 MAR 94 / Observer: Scandal fiasco
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When does the Whitewater brouhaha turn into a scandal? The resignation of
Webster Hubbell, the US associate attorney general and US presidential
buddy, raises a question which is vexing careful newspaper editors.
Up to yesterday, Observer's electronic database showed a total of 347
references in the UK press to Bill and Hillary's Whitewater problems. There
were 178 mentions of 'scandal' and just 111 'affairs'. Poor old uproar,
fiasco, furore, blemish and slur don't warrant a mention; fuss gets just
one.
Of course statistics are no guide to anything. With the tally to date
standing at one suicide and two resignations, the verdict of one ex-member
of President Bush's administration is: 'Right now it's an affair. Four more
resignations, then it's a scandal.'

Who says that members of the European parliament don't have a sense of
humour?
Take Johanna-Christina Grund, a German Euro-MP. She has floated the notion
that, given the high annual rent for the new parliamentary debating chamber
 -Ecu100m annually for 27 years - visitors should be charged an entry fee.
She says it should 'be at a similar level for national museums, zoos, etc in
Belgium'. MEPs might occasionally be mistaken for stuffed exhibits and
sometimes behave like animals; but really, let's have a pan-European

Not everyone hates Britain's motorway cones. Footballers like to use them to
practice their dribbling.
Indeed, Newcastle United has become so attached to the cones at its Durham
training ground that it has just had them kitted out in the club's colours.
Apparently, the Department of Transport's regulation red and white strip for
its motorway cones is identical to the colours of United's rivals -
Sunderland.
So United's manager Kevin Keegan turned to club vice-president, Tom Brown,
for help. When Brown is not watching United, he's chairman of
Northumberland-based RTM Group, which supplies cones and contra-flow
cylinders for motorway contractors.
No sooner had Keegan blown the whistle than Brown had paid Pounds 1,000 to
have his team's 50 red and white cones recovered in different colours so
they wouldn't clash with United's black and white team strip.

Sounds of merchant banks on the move in the City of London. No sooner has
BZW, Barclays' international investment bank, been given the green light to
move in to its parent's soon-to-be-vacated Royal Mint Court headquarters,
than word reaches Observer that Barings, the City's oldest merchant bank, is
also flitting.
Barings, which has been at 8 Bishopsgate since 1807, is coy about its future
movements. However, it is clear that, if it goes through with its plan to
combine its merchant bank and fast-growing securities business under one
roof, there is not going to be enough room for everybody at 8 Bishopsgate.
The obvious choice is for Barings to regroup at Baring Securities' vulgar
America Square headquarters near the Tower of London.
But that would mean Barings giving up its precious EC2 postcode, which it
shares with the Bank of England and other pukka members of the British
banking community. No doubt the young turks now running Barings couldn't
care less about their postcode.
But there are still some customers who worry about such things.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Masochistic voyeurs have enjoyed watching Birmingham's local government draw
up a list of candidates to recline on the bed of nails marked chief
executive; the present occupant, Roger Taylor, has decided to go early.
Why should intelligent bureaucrats step in between the warring fiefdoms of
council departments and combative councillors? It has to be the eighth
deadly sin: ambition. Brum is England's largest metropolitan authority.
The council is silent over who wants the Pounds 80,000-a-year job, but word
is that among the 10 names in the frame are two women - Sheffield's Pamela
Gordon and Southwark's Anna Wyatt. There is thus the intriguing possibility
of a female alliance emerging. Theresa Stewart, the current Labour leader,
faces difficult elections in May. Does she favour either Gordon or Wyatt?
The last woman chief executive in the West Midlands - at Sandwell -
eventually decamped for New Zealand. Must be something in the water . . .

FT  16 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Better fewer but better
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is growing concern at Westminster over the way that legislation is
drafted and passed. On Monday, Mr Howard Davies, director general of the
Confederation of British Industry, added the voice of the business community
to such worries. In a speech at the European Policy Forum, he called for an
overhaul of the legislative process, with more consultation, better drafting
and improved scrutiny.
The case for reform is strong. The weight of legislation is growing - this
year's Finance Bill, at 471 pages, is the longest in history. Yet an
increasing amount of time is spent on remedying the defects of recent
legislation. Last year's Criminal Justice Act repealed sentencing reforms
introduced in the 1991 Act. A one-clause bill is needed to restore the
powers of transport police, inadvertently watered down in last year's rail
privatisation act.
A telling indicator of the need for change is the growing number of
amendments the government has to table to its own legislation in the Lords.
These have more than doubled during the 1980s according to evidence
submitted by Lord Howe to the Hansard Society commission on the legislative
process which reported last year. The late drafting and tabling of
amendments inevitably makes parliamentary scrutiny less thorough. It also
makes it harder for business and other organisations to make an informed
contribution towards shaping legislation.
Drafting quality
Some of the blame for this has been laid at the door of the parliamentary
counsel who draft legislation. The European Policy Forum has recently
suggested breaking their monopoly to improve the quality of drafting.
Involving outside lawyers in the work would allow departments access to a
larger pool of talent. Contracting-out would also force departments to
define their objectives clearly and devise reasonable timetables that legal
firms could work to.
However, it is not bad drafting which has led to repeated amendments to the
Police and Magistrates Courts Bill currently passing through the Lords. It
is the failure of the home secretary, Mr Michael Howard, to convince peers
of the wisdom of centralising control over the police service. Mr John
Patten, education secretary, has also had to concede amendments to his
Education Bill to address scepticism over his proposals to curb student
unions and to allow schools to control teacher training. Better drafting
could improve the quality of legislation - but ministers have much more to
contribute.
Ministerial machismo
Too much legislation is rushed through parliament too hastily. In some
cases, this is to deal with political crises such as a surge in joy-riding
or a spate of attacks by dangerous dogs. But in most cases, it is
ministerial machismo which sees pushing through radical reforms as the best
way to climb the greasy pole. Frequent ministerial reshuffles encourage this
belief, since ministers move on before the trouble they have created
manifests itself.
A more serious approach to consultation on contentious changes in the law
would help counter such tendencies. Mr Davies says that some departments
consult business in 'an unsatisfactory or perfunctory way'. He cites the
Home Office failure to consult on fire safety regulations, scrapped only
after direct intervention by the CBI. And just three weeks was initially
given for comments on complex proposals to reform pensions law issued in
January. Ministers should give adequate time for consultation and report
more fully on the outcome.
Another useful step would be to limit the number of contentious pieces of
legislation passed in each session. This would allow more time for
legislative 'housekeeping', such as legal reforms drafted by the Law
Commission. Uncontroversial measures needed by business - such as amendments
to the Sale of Goods Act, legislation on the Privity of Contract and a new
Restrictive Practices Bill - have all been ready for years but denied
parliamentary time.
There are other measures that could improve the legislative process, such as
creating two finance bills to separate technical tax changes from more
radical policy changes. But the key to better legislation is have less of
it, and do it better.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Personal View: Time for the new Italy to take power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CARLO DE BENEDETTI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Economic growth and competitiveness are the world's dominant political
themes today. In North America and Asia, the main concern of government and
business is how to achieve a strong position in the global economy. Ideology
has been abandoned in favour of a pragmatic search for the quickest, surest
way to boost competitiveness and growth, and to turn the prospect of a new
cycle of international economic growth into reality.
In Europe, on the other hand, the break with the past is not so clear-cut.
Political attention seems to focus on the past rather than the future; on
defence rather than attack; on rejuvenating the old rather than creating the
new. The result is yet another year of missed business opportunities for
Europe, and rising unemployment to socially unacceptable levels.
This contradiction is even more evident in Italy. Here, political debate has
either failed to take account of the future now emerging; or it is confined
to impromptu, demagogic assertions that ignore the global competition Italy
should be preparing to meet, if it wishes to avoid being excluded from the
ranks of industrialised nations.
Now, in the run-up to an election that will be decisive for the country's
future, the electoral scene is far from inspiring.
On March 27 and 28, Italians go to the polls under a new electoral system -
the outcome of a referendum which vetoed the intolerable regime of
corruption and inefficiency generated by the lack of alternatives to the
dominant political system. For months, debate centred on how to create an
electoral system that would permit alternation between a progressive pole
and a conservative pole, enabling Italy to stand alongside the great western
democracies.
But partly because the new electoral law was the reluctant product of a
parliament forced to act by the result of the referendum, the elections will
take place in a climate dominated by three main factors.
First, the reality of transformation: to a great extent these elections are
in the hands of the offspring of the old political system, of whom the most
brazen representative is the standard-bearer of Forza Italia, together with
the embalmed remains of certain areas of the left.
Second, the risk to economic self-sufficiency: a real risk which lies
beneath the wonder cures promised by the right, or the sermons of the
outdated apologists of the left.
Third, confusion: the contest is riddled with left-over ideologies which
have been disinterred for the occasion.
Such suicidal behaviour may not be surprising coming from the new right; but
it is alarming when it appears among the more serious elements of the centre
and the left.
What politicians should be doing is explaining to the electorate that Italy
is not the centre of the world, or even of Europe; and that if we want to
remain at the forefront of world markets, we have to identify our
competitive advantages and abandon rearguard actions and verbal wars.
Behind all the manoeuvrings of the politicians, old and new, in this vital
election, there is a country which has decided to move on: this is the real
Italy. The country has grown. You need look no further than today's great
moral clean-up which, in its pursuit of a whole generation of corrupt
politicians, has reached a scale unparalleled in any other country.
Or the spirit of sacrifice displayed by countless citizens in the face of an
often chaotic, punitive fiscal system and an inefficient, oppressive public
sector.
Or the vigour and innovative capacity of an entrepreneurial class that has
reasserted its competitiveness despite the constraints under which it
operates. The remarkable improvement in the trade balance in 1993 from
L4,000bn to L50,000bn was not due entirely to devaluation.
This Italy must be represented politically by dignified action and thought.
The growing interest in its financial markets demonstrates that Italy's
international image is changing. And foreign observers' view of the new
Italy is far more accurate than the picture created by the election
campaign.
Italy cannot afford to forego the chance to take part in a new cycle of
growth in an ever more interconnected world. This will require rational
decisions, calculated sacrifices and an acceptable balance between recovery
and growth. It means social consensus and a government capable of plotting
an intelligent, pragmatic and credible course.
There is no room here for slogans and miracle makers. In today's world,
non-alignment with other nations means economic and social decline, with the
risk of losing the basic values of democracy and freedom.
This is the 'Italian risk' two weeks before the elections.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Summit for good jobs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The jobs summit in Detroit was never likely to come up with exciting new
solutions. What it could do was register agreement on the importance of the
topic and indicate the nature of the emerging consensus on what to do about
it. This the summit has done. In breaking new ground for the discussions
among the group of seven industrial countries, it may even have given that
intellectually moribund body new life.
Not that the G7's familiar macroeconomic disharmony was entirely absent. One
of the recurring leitmotifs of its two decades has been the US effort to
persuade the Germans to adopt more expansionary policies. The jobs summit
was partly an imaginative new way to achieve that old objective. The pitch
adopted by US labour secretary, Robert Reich, was that 'cyclical
unemployment which persists may turn into structural or classical types of
unemployment, which are more difficult to address'. The argument is correct,
but it cuts two ways. Rising inflation must also be avoided, because it
leads to recession as surely as night follows day. It is not clear that the
Clinton administration understands this point.
If a transatlantic consensus on macroeconomic policy is lacking, the
agreement elsewhere was encouraging. The summit has, for example, rejected
protection against imports and embraced innovation, rightly so, in both
cases. Labour intensive imports and new technology will make industrial
countries richer. But, as Mr Reich observes, they also exact a price. 'The
primary structural labour market problem,' he notes, 'is a shift in relative
labour demand against less-educated workers and those doing routine tasks
and towards workers with problem solving skills.'
Increased inequality
In the US, the result has been increased inequality, with workers in the
higher earnings bracket enjoying a 4.4 per cent increase in real wages over
the past 20 years, while those on the bottom suffered a 10.3 per cent real
decline. Because there was no overall real wage growth, US employment also
grew by some 40 per cent. In continental Europe, by contrast, average real
wages grew rapidly over the past two decades - by 76 per cent in France and
43 per cent in Germany. There was also very little increase in pay
inequality. But these countries enjoyed virtually no employment growth,
while unemployment rose, cycle by cycle.
The question then is not whether jobs can be created. It is obvious that
they can be. The question is whether those new jobs can be combined with
sustained rises in average real wages and the pay equality to which
Europeans, in particular, are attached. The challenge is not just more jobs;
it is 'good jobs' for everyone.
Holy grail
Secretary Reich's own suggested solution is the trio of European-style
education and training, US-style labour market flexibility and expansionary
macroeconomic policy. So is this the holy grail for jobs? Only up to a
point, Mr Reich.
Yes, education and training matter, but high-quality basic education matters
most, a policy that may never work for all and certainly will not act
quickly. Yes, labour market flexibility is essential, but this is a
euphemism for policies that will lower the relative and quite possibly the
absolute real wage of the unskilled, precisely what Europeans - and
increasingly Americans - find objectionable. And yes, macroeconomic policy
must accommodate growth, but even Padraig Flynn, European commissioner for
employment, agrees that 'there is a new conventional wisdom that cyclical
recovery will not be the way out'.
There is room for a great deal of imaginative new thinking of the kind
contained in a new pamphlet from the London-based think-tank Demos on 'the
end of unemployment'. But at the heart of that thinking must be ways to
lower the cost of hiring new employees. If at the same time rewards are to
be sustained, large employment subsidies for the unskilled will be required,
instead of the taxes often imposed upon them. But that would necessitate
higher taxes elsewhere. Combined with subsidies for training and radical
labour market deregulation, this is the only policy likely to put industrial
countries on the path they are apparently seeking.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Why Wales resists change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From JOSEPHINE FARRINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest Philip Stephens' article, 'PM urged to shelve
radical plans' (March 14), on growing pressure for the government to delay
implementing local government reorganisation in England until after the next
general election. I hope the same 'consolidators' to whom he refers will
also press the prime minister to drop the unpopular proposals for changing
Welsh local government.
Only one in five in the principality supports the government's plans to
establish 21 so-called unitary authorities at a cost of Pounds 201m. If the
people of Wales, members of the Confederation of British Industry, Trades
Union Congress, voluntary organisations and the overwhelming majority of
Welsh MPs oppose this proposal, how can English MPs justify forcing it on
them? They could not have sent a clearer message to Whitehall. For a
government that claims to want to listen to the people, it is certainly keen
to ignore the wishes of the Welsh. They have not been given an independent
commission to examine council structure.
We can only hope the same ministers now making such pragmatic noises about
reforming English local government will speak up for Wales.

   From Mr DEREK C JENKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Colin Amery ('A lifeline for the South Bank', March 14) falls into the
trap which catches so many of those who write about architecture - he
assumes that external appearance is everything. In praising the Festival
Hall, while damning the Queen Elizabeth Hall and Hayward Gallery, he takes
no account of the ability of each building to fulfil its true function
successfully.
In the ways in which a concert hall can enhance a musical performance and
its enjoyment, by the musicians and audience, the RFH is the worst venue,
not just in London, but in all the main centres in Europe. The QEH, on the
other hand, ranks with the Wigmore as the best in this respect.
Among galleries, the Hayward exhibition space complements 20th century works
in a way that is matched by no other leading London site. To suggest that
buildings do not fulfil their real purpose superbly, merely because a vocal
section of opinion deems them to be ugly on the outside, is a very poor
application of values and priorities.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not a recent change in English
company law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr E A COLEMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Jean Thibaud's article on recent developments in French banking and
company law was most informative (Business and the Law: 'Overthrow of ancien
regime', March 8).
Allow me, however, to correct what appears to be an inaccuracy in the
article. Mr Thibaud states, in the fourth paragraph, that 'England has
recently accepted netting (ie. set-off) as a basic principle of insolvency
law. . .'. In point of fact, bankruptcy/insolvency set-off has been the rule
in England since the time of Queen Anne (see s11 of 4&amp;5 Anne c17), if not
before (see s2 of the 1570 statute, 13 Elizabeth, c7).
Perhaps Mr Thibaud's reference to a 'recent' acceptance of netting in
England was a reference to the (somewhat belated) recognition by the
financial law panel of the principle of insolvency set-off (see the panel's
guidance note on netting of November 19 1993).

FT  16 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Scottish salmon competitive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JIM PAYNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In the letter 'Scottish salmon also subsidised' (March 14), Mr Roderick
Thomas wildly exaggerates the level of support which has been received by
the Scottish salmon farming industry. Moreover, in every case, any support
for the industry has been completely in accordance with European Union
rules.
Contrary to what he states, Norway has no natural advantages over Scotland
for growing salmon. This is why the performance of Scottish farms is now as
good, or possibly better, than those in Norway.
There is no truth in the statement that Norwegian salmon farms are
profitable at a price of 20 per cent to 30 per cent lower than the cost of
production in Scotland. The most careful analysis reveals that costs of
production are roughly comparable in both countries.
Mr Thomas is also wrong about the threat from Chile. Chile can compete only
in Europe on frozen salmon. The freight cost for fresh salmon from Chile to
Europe makes that business uneconomic. Otherwise, of course, there would be
fresh salmon arriving in Europe now, at a time when the Chileans are
vigorously searching for new markets.

In the last years of the 20th century this is an absurd call. Mr Gummer
should seek to ensure, as a matter of urgency, that the whole of the
conveyancing process should become a real-time screen-to-screen process. The
hardware, the software and the technical know-how to effect this are all
immediately available to his department. At a stroke, conveyancing could, if
the will were there, become a fast, efficient and cheap process which would

FT  16 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Heading down unhealthy path
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALAN BEITH MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Alison Smith's report, 'Building societies aim to shake off shackles'
(March 10), underlines the hostility of some building society executives to
any form of accountability to their members, whose capital they manage.
When I raised this issue of accountability in a speech to the Building
Societies Association a few months ago, I received an intriguing mixture of
public criticism and private support. The leading article in Mortgage
Finance Gazette asserted in reply that society boards and the Building
Societies Commission should take active steps to prevent the election as
directors of people not chosen by the current directors, and questioned
'whether mutuality meant anything more than not being required to pay
shareholders dividends'.
The government even suggests that building societies, which constantly mail
advertising material to their members, should be relieved of the burden of
notifying them by post of their voting rights at the annual general meeting.
Some people in the industry do recognise that a complete absence of
accountability, even if regulation became more effective, would be extremely

FT  16 MAR 94 / Futile and flawed: The UK cannot impose its vision of Europe
on its EU partners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is hard to make strategic sense of the British government's campaign to
restrict majority voting in Europe. Yes, I know ministers are frightened of
the anti-Europeans in their party; and presumably they hope to appease them
with a vigorous stand in defence of national sovereignty. But the problem is
that this is a crusade which is certain to fail in the medium term, and
probably in the short term as well.
In any case, why go out on a limb now? The Maastricht treaty was such a
miserable experience for Mr John Major that you would think the prime
minister would do his best to steer clear of all questions of principle
about Europe and its development for as long as possible. Yet here he is,
taking a combative stand on an issue which is bound to involve a battle on
two fronts: it must lead to an unwinnable confrontation with his partners in
Europe, but it must also stir up the anti-European campaigners among those
who are nominally his own supporters. This is a spectacular exercise in
political masochism.
This crusade is doomed to defeat, because its underlying objectives set the
UK at odds with virtually all its European partners. The government pretends
that it is only asking that the voting rules which protect blocking
minorities in the Council of Ministers should be kept at the present level,
even after the admission of four more member states: 23 votes, or the
equivalent of two big countries and one small.
The reality, of course, is that the British government is trying to make
majority voting more difficult than at present; whereas effective
decision-making in a larger Union will obviously require more majority
voting, not less.
The puzzle is that the Conservative government seems to have been manoeuvred
by its Euro-phobic wing into refighting the last war but one. The windmill
it is tilting at is the old fantasy that Britain's national sovereignty is
threatened by the sinister federalists in Brussels; and it appears to
imagine that it can creep by stealth back in the direction of a national
veto. It does not seem to realise that the terms of the debate have been
changed beyond recognition.
Many years ago, in 1965-66, the Community had a shattering confrontation
between France and the rest, over the rights and wrongs of majority voting.
That was before majority voting was due to come into force as part of the
Community's normal regime, and the French were trying to prevent it
happening. After a six-month confrontation, a truce was signed in 1966 which
was afterwards called the Luxembourg Compromise, even though there had been
no compromise on anything. Nevertheless, the psychological shock of the
crisis effectively deterred majority voting for 20 years.
But the Luxembourg Compromise was wiped off the slate by the 1986 Single
European Act, which explicitly broadened the scope for majority voting; and
the agenda on the slate was rewritten by the Maastricht treaty, which also
carried the majority voting trend even further.
As a result, today's central question about majority voting is the reverse
of yesterday's: it is not whether a member state can be compelled by
majority vote to do things it would rather not do, but whether it can use
its national veto to prevent most or all of its partners from doing what
they collectively want to do.
It is now clear that the first, old-fashioned question can have several
different answers. Most rational people now recognise that the purpose of
majority voting is not to out-vote the recalcitrant, but to persuade them to
negotiate and to compromise. But for those who will not negotiate and will
not submit, there is the alternative of the opt-out: if you don't like the
journey, you can leave the ship.
That was the double lesson of Maastricht: the other member states could not
compel the UK to accept the social chapter, or the Danes to accept monetary
union or indeed anything else in the treaty; but nor, in the last resort,
could Britain and Denmark prevent the others from going ahead with the
treaty they had compromised on. In the long run, the majority will get the
kind of Europe they want, and the options for those who disagree will
essentially be quite simple: to compromise, to submit, or to stand aside. If
majority decisions are blocked inside the Council of Ministers, through
systematic legal obstruction, they will be taken outside, in some other way.
If the British government is now trying to strengthen the legal methods of
obstruction, it is perhaps because it is slowly dawning that the opt-out is
not a satisfactory type of solution.
The plan for economic and monetary union may well prove an acute test case,
and it is likely to come to a head during the 1996 Inter-Governmental
Conference to review and revise the Maastricht treaty. At that moment, it
will be clear which member states are still committed to monetary union. And
it is quite possible that an inner core will be ready to go ahead to a
single currency, conceivably in a very near future. Mr Major will then be
left holding his opt-out, which means he cannot stop them, just as it means
he cannot join them.
Note that the concept 'blocking minority' does not exist in any European
treaties. What they lay down is the number of positive votes required to
pass a measure; at present 54 out of 76. The underlying assumption is that
the governments which signed the treaties share a broad political consensus
on the purpose of their association. That consensus did not exist in 1965.
But the French lost that battle for one simple reason: they could not impose
their view of Europe then, and it is time the British saw that they cannot
impose their view of Europe now.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Essential, or just extra baggage: Is bigger better in the
global business travel industry?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If employees of Foseco, the Birmingham-based metallurgical company, try to
book business class tickets when they should be flying economy, Wagonlit
Travel will let Mr John Lamb know.
Mr Lamb, Foseco's chief accountant, says the company's contract with
Wagonlit gives it far greater control over business travel costs than it
could ever achieve alone.
Wagonlit's technology enables Mr Lamb to obtain, at 24 hours' notice, a
computerised record of where employees have travelled recently and whether
they got the best deal available. If they have not, he asks them why.
Wagonlit, which is part of Accor, the French hotel and catering group,
yesterday announced details of its plan to combine its business travel
interests with those of Carlson of the US to create a worldwide network with
combined revenues of Dollars 10.8bn, operating from 4,000 locations in 125
countries.
Two main competitors, American Express and Thomas Cook, each operate from
about 2,000 locations - either their own offices or those of client
companies.
The two sides in the partnership said the new company, Carlson Wagonlit
Travel, aimed to 'service the growing needs of the global business
traveller, to market the new brand worldwide, develop new global business
travel technology and pursue immediate expansion into new business markets
throughout the world, in particular the Asian and Pacific regions'.
Mr Curt Carlson, the founder of the Carlson empire, says the combined travel
company will be able to improve services to clients such as General
Electric, which places its Dollars 350m-a-year travel business with Carlson
in Phoenix, Arizona.
Mr Carlson, whose company's other interests include Radisson Hotels and TGI
Friday's restaurants, which are not part of the merged venture, says: 'Big
companies often have difficulty with their travel, operating in new
countries where agencies often just speak the local language and airlines
use different (ticket) codes.'
Carlson will contribute its strengths in the US to Wagonlit's strong
position in Europe. The newly-merged company will invest an initial Dollars
40m in setting up or buying agencies in Asia, the Pacific region, Latin
America and Africa, where it is under-represented.
Why did they choose each other? Mr Herve Gourio, president of Wagonlit
Travel, says: 'Carlson is the best partner for us because we are about the
same size in the travel business and at the group level. Neither is
predominant, European or American.'
Mr Travis Tanner, president of Carlson Travel, promises 'a real working
union to create the number one in business travel. Not a paper partnership,
nor a smoke and mirrors arrangement.' He said Carlson 'needed a prominent
position in Europe - to have done it ourselves would have taken a great deal
of time and money'.
Rivals in the industry, however, were quick to cast doubt on the prospects
of merging two organisations with such different cultures. 'This is not a
marriage made in heaven,' said one rival business travel executive. 'I can't
see the Americans being run by the French, or vice-versa.'
The new company will have two chairmen, one from Carlson and one from
Wagonlit, and two chief executives, also one from each side. Although the
company headquarters will be in London, the two sides said 'daily operations
will be co-ordinated from Minneapolis and Paris respectively'.
Carlson, one of the largest privately-owned groups in the US, is seen in the
travel industry as run with a firm hand from its Minneapolis headquarters.
Wagonlit, which has gone through a series of changes and acquisitions, is
regarded as still formulating its culture.
Accor acquired Wagonlit, which had taken over the UK business travel
interests of Pickfords, in 1992. The company was then called Wagons-Lits,
but changed its name to Wagonlit last year to distinguish itself from
Accor's railway services division, which still uses the old name.
The planned new company brings together some of the oldest names in the
travel business. Carlson's travel business began as the Ask Mr Foster travel
agency in St Augustine, Florida, in 1888, making it the oldest travel agency
in the US. Its name came from a local resident, Mr Foster, who was the
unofficial keeper of train timetables. Carlson acquired Ask Mr Foster in
1979.
Wagonlit was founded in 1872 to provide sleeping cars for overnight
travellers on European trains. In 1928 it set up travel agencies in rail
ticket offices throughout Europe.
For over 60 years, Wagonlit had an alliance with Thomas Cook. The thinking
behind the tie was that Thomas Cook's strength in the old British Empire
would complement Wagonlit's power in continental Europe. The link was
dissolved in 1989.
In a pointed statement yesterday, Mr Christopher Rodrigues, Thomas Cook's
chief executive, said: 'Since we decided to sever our relationship with
Wagonlit, we have been building the Thomas Cook network by working with
like-minded partners who put customer service first. Forming alliances is
only the beginning of the relationship and major industry players such as
ourselves will be watching the progress of this alliance with interest.
However, it will be customers who will judge its real value.'
Not all Wagonlit's customers see merit in the merger or in the idea that
companies need a single business to handle their travel requirements
worldwide.
Mr Lamb says Foseco does not even have the same travel agents as Burmah
Castrol, its parent company, which uses Thomas Cook. Foseco was already
using Wagonlit when it was acquired by Burmah Castrol in 1990. Although the
company asks different agencies to bid for its travel account every two or
three years, it has seen no need to abandon Wagonlit, which has two staff
members based at Foseco's premises.
Mr Lamb says that Foseco and Burmah Castrol did decide jointly to seek
discounts from airlines as their larger combined purchasing power enabled
them to get a better deal. They have investigated using a single travel
agency throughout the group, but decided there were no similar savings to be
made. The larger combined purchasing power would not have yielded bigger
discounts.
Mr Lamb believes there are advantages to having two travel agencies working
for different parts of his group. He says: 'We believe it keeps both of them
on their toes.'
Mr Lamb is sceptical of the claim that combining Wagonlit with Carlson will
enable the combined group to deliver a more competitive service. He says:
'My answer to that is: if getting much bigger means you can purchase so much
more efficiently, kindly tell us how much that's going to benefit us in
discounts.'
The proposed merger does have its champions, however. Mr Andrew Solum,
travel manager of Inmarsat, the international satellite organisation, which
is also a Wagonlit customer, says it should bring significant benefits.
After taking on Wagonlit last year to handle travel arrangements from its
London headquarters, Mr Solum was sufficiently impressed to ask them to do
the same for Inmarsat's offices in Princeton, New Jersey. Six weeks ago, the
organisation opened an office in Beijing, where Wagonlit is not represented.
Mr Solum hopes the planned merger will enable Carlson Wagonlit Travel to
open an office there.
He says the idea of a global travel agency network is more than mere hype.
If his organisation's employees are bumped off flights in different parts of
the world, he says a call from Wagonlit to the airline often gets them back
on the aircraft. The wider a travel agency network's reach, the more places
there are where it can perform such services.
He says: 'Wherever you are in the world, if you've got a Wagonlit ticket,
you can go into a local office if you've got a problem. You've got somewhere
to go if you've been robbed.'

FT  16 MAR 94 / Arts: Farewell to a nice little era - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So - as Private Eye's teenage poet EJ Thribb would say, farewell Minder,
Absolutely Fabulous and The Man From Auntie: your catchphrases were 'A nice
little earner', 'Be a good girl and make Mummy a capuccino' and 'My name's
Ben Elton good night'. Thursdays won't be the same without you. True, it
would be surprising if we had to wait long before Elton, now such a wholly
professional comedian, was back, and the BBC people claim there will be
another series of Absolutely Fabulous though they cannot say when. As for
Minder, it has run for 107 episodes, and, although they have cried wolf
before and then relented and given us more, it does seem as though one-off
'specials' are all we shall get in future.
The days when television schedules were carved in granite and changed with
the seasons just three times a year, seem to have gone for ever. Series that
run for even 13 episodes, never mind 26, are now rare. Switch on ITV next
Thursday at 8.30, the time when Minder has been going out, and you will see
the first in a half-hour series called Outside Edge, worked up by Richard
Harris from his splendid stage comedy about oddly matched couples in a
cricket club. So far there are just seven episodes.
Meanwhile, if you switch on ITV at 8.30 tomorrow night, you can make an
interesting comparison. Filling in for just one week is a Minder repeat, the
first episode ever made, called 'Gunfight At The OK Laundrette' (a spelling
which could explain the title of Hanif Kureishi's 1985 script My Beautiful
Laundrette). From the upbeat signature tune to the location filming of
London, from the central importance of the tough Terry McCann character to
the subordinate role played by George Cole's laughable Arthur Daley, this
shrieks of what it actually was: an effort by the Thames TV subsidiary
Euston Films to take the most notable aspects of The Sweeney and turn them
into a vehicle for Dennis Waterman who had played the rough diamond sergeant
in that police series. When you see in this first Minder episode armed
police leaping from a Transit van, filmed from overhead, there is no
mistaking the programme's antecedents.
As time went by Waterman's limitations and Cole's strengths became clear,
and the centre of gravity changed. Once McCann ceased to be the flywheel of
the series there was less need for violent action and Minder became more a
comedy of manners and character. Making the last episode mirror the first,
by having Arthur instead of his minder taken hostage, served to emphasise
the ways in which it had evolved. On the other hand Absolutely Fabulous has
rarely been anything more than a comedy of manners. There have been one or
two powerful inventions to relish, for instance the loathing of Patsy, the
sixties reprobate, for Saffron, the sanctimonious greenie teenie, a loathing
which cuts right across the grain of today's adulation of yoof and
environmental agonising.
However, that has been the exception, not the rule. The rule in Ab Fab has
been a type of comedy that relies upon dialogue in a way that makes it
almost as suitable for radio as for television. Interestingly, and somewhat
ironically, the comedy series starring Dawn French, Murder Most Horrid,
which now provides a comedy substitute on Thursday nights, is far more
concerned with dramatic 'business' and the physical aspects of comedy.
(Perhaps French and Saunders could get together and pool their varied
talents; what a partnership . . .) Unlike so many series, Murder Most Horrid
fully justifies the phrase 'situation comedy'.
In the opening episode French's attempt to hang herself was interrupted by
the arrival of a professional assassin intent upon killing a man in a
building across the street. She fits French with a walkie-talkie and sends
her across to do the dirty work, but security guards present problems.
Persuaded over the r/t to offer them 'blow jobs', a phrase that means
nothing to her, French bumps them off one at a time in the gents. Written by
Steven Moffat, this had the same sort of appeal as A Fish Called Wanda.
Remarkably episode 2, with a script by Paul Smith and Terry Kyan, proved
equally good and just as funny, with French appearing to be the unbearably
gossipy hostage of a bank robber but in the end turning all the tables.
The small spate of new series in what would once have been mid-season was
swollen on Sunday night by two in succession from BBC1: yet another comedy,
and yet another drama series about an oddball police detective. On the
evidence of the opening episodes, they do not look likely to challenge
French or Saunders for comedy laurels, or Minder for the qualipop drama
crown. The comedy, Honey For Tea, stars Felicity Kendal as a drop-dead
gorgeous American widow who has brought her hunk of a son, Jake, to
Cambridge to inveigle him into the college funded by his late father, while
wheedling herself a job in the bursar's office.
It is a good enough scenario, but Michael Aitkens, creator of the superb
Waiting For God, has mystifyingly opted for American and British stereotypes
which are two generations out of date. Silly ass Cambridge dons baffled by
Americanisms went out with mortar boards: today they take their cue from
David Lodge and earn fortunes on the international conference circuit. And
rich Americans, raised on a PBS channel diet of British costume drama, do
not split their sides at the notion of hunting anything as small as a fox.
As for Pie In The Sky, with Richard Griffiths as the reluctant detective who
wants to leave the police and run a restaurant but is being blackmailed into
staying (a thin variation on the old 'one last mission' routine) we shall
have to see. So far the foodie content looks more convincing than the police
element, but the important question will be whether this is written from the
character outwards, or is just another contrived formula: 'Let's put him in
a wheelchair] Oh no, Ironside. Well make him an antique dealer then - damn,
Lovejoy. How about a gourmet cook? Yes, that'll do . . .' Still, you never
know: Minder was produced to a formula with a purpose rather than bursting
from the breast of an impassioned writer, and that lasted 15 years.

The effects of Thatcherite reforms on the NHS are beginning to surface, like
the oil-smeared detritus from a depth-charged submarine. BBC1's new tabloid
current affairs magazine, Here And Now, promises us a top surgeon who has
gone undercover to expose the goings-on at NHS HQ in Leeds (7.30).
Dispatches shows how fewer patients are referred to specialists, and how
teams of experts are being disbanded as a result (9.00 C4).
Not before time BBC2 screens a programme questioning the modern tendency to
put children on pedestals and give them everything they want: Spoiling The
Child? Goodness knows what the question mark is for. As with the 'What
ghouls]' reaction of ghoulish newspaper reports from Gloucester, there is
some irony here: television is a major contributor to the transformation of
children into tin gods (8.10 BBC2).
BBC2's filmed drama slot, 'Screen Two', offers a story called All Things
Bright And Beautiful about a 10-year-old Irish altar boy who, in 1954,
starts to see visions of the Virgin Mary (9.00).

FT  16 MAR 94 / Arts: Beckett's Footfalls - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Long after the performance of a Samuel Beckett play ends, its meanings go on
gathering. Plays seldom come shorter than his Footfalls (1976), and yet its
brief mysteries lodge such a wealth of suggestion and connection in your
head that it can effectively fill a whole evening.
The play, which lasts less than 20 minutes, has just come to the West End
for a week, two performances per night (7.30 and 9.30), all tickets at
Pounds 4, with Deborah Warner directing Fiona Shaw and Susan Engels. The
problem is whether Warner and Shaw help you to attend to the play as much as
to their own way with it.
The two women of Footfalls are mother and daughter. The mother is a voice
(Engels), unseen; the daughter, May (Shaw), a woman now in her forties, whom
we see, continually and audibly paces this way and that, as she goes over
the past in her mind. She has never recovered from some early shock or
shocks; it is possible that she has never recovered from being born. Voice
of mother: 'I had you late. (Pause.) In life. (Pause.) Forgive me again.'
Each woman looms in the other's mind. May (after pacing): 'Were you asleep?'
Voice: 'Deep asleep. (Pause) I heard you in my deep sleep. (Pause) There is
no sleep so deep I would not hear you there.'
Here, as throughout, how many implications a line can have. The numerous
implications of this last line include: Big Mother is hearing you; so deep
is my love for you that your voice will never go unheard by me; the
umbilical cord between us is unbroken and troubles me still; I would sleep
easy were it not for you; you are a voice in my dreams; I will hear you even
when I reach the great sleep of death; you keep breaking into my sleep and
you always will; I can never sleep easy where you are concerned. . .
Since we never see the mother, we may well come to interpret her voice as a
voice within her daughter's mind: in which case that line acquires further
connotations: Mother, I will always wake you; Mother, you will never escape
me; Mother, I will always haunt you; and more.
There is probably not a meaning in the play that Fiona Shaw and Deborah
Warner have not thought about - though they choose to ignore a few of
Beckett's precise instructions. (He required that May's feet be heard but
not seen, and that she have grey hair and a gray wrap. Shaw's stockinged
legs and sandalled feet can be seen; likewise her dark hair and red dress.)
Shaw's obsessive intensity, her wit, her ability to alternate voices, her
Irishness, all pay dividends. And so does Engel's ponderous, cultivated
contralto.
Warner's most daring stroke is to have Shaw spend most of the play not
onstage but on a special platform in the centre of the dress circle; and to
have Engel's voice emerge from beneath her, so that Shaw, in the very centre
of the audience, seems to pace upon her mother's tomb.
But must Shaw and Warner reveal their talent in so self-advertising a
manner? Shaw's withered-old-maid posture is too obviously contrived; her
sexually frustrated fiddlings at the folds of dress before her crotch are
over-emphatic; and her little-girl petrified-virgin voice makes the whole
affair artificial.
In some ways, Footfalls seem to encapsulate all those other Shaw-Warner
collaborations that London has seen in recent years (Electra, The Good
Person of Sichuan, Hedda Gabler). I do not mean that as much of a
compliment. Thanks largely to Warner, Shaw has developed in recent years a
dreadfully solipsistic way of acting, as if there were no one else onstage;
thanks also to Warner, she has become our most emphatic exponent of female
neurosis and/or victimisation and/or masochism. True, Footfalls is a far
more appropriate vehicle for all this than those other plays - but those of
us who have been through the other Shaw-Warner collaborations may well feel
that this is just more of the same.
At the Garrick Theatre until April 19.
Presented by Deborah Warner and Maison de la Culture, Bobigny, Paris.

<TEXT>
The great composers of the romantic era are fair game these days for
conductors from the period-instrument movement. Twenty years ago Bach and
Handel were still being played by symphony orchestras; 10 years ago people
argued that 'authentic' Haydn and Mozart would never catch on.
Each decade the authentic brigade moves on to its next hunting ground.
Norrington and Gardiner have already tackled Berlioz and Brahms, both making
a particularly good job of the latter's German Requiem. Now Nikolaus
Harnoncourt, known in his earlier days for his Monteverdi operas and Bach
cantatas, has caught up with them. The enormous success of his Beethoven
symphony cycle made further progress into the 19th century inevitable.
There is one big difference with Harnoncourt. When he conducts classical or
romantic music he prefers to work with conventional orchestras - although he
does his level best to turn them into honorary period musicians. The
admirable young players of the Chamber Orchestra of Europe look wholehearted
converts: the double-bass players play standing up, the timpanist sits on a
low chair and the violins renounce their usual vibrato.
In Harnoncourt's hands they become a lithe, red-blooded orchestral animal,
with lean strings and snarling brass, ready to pounce at their conductor's
next command. There is a high quota of aggression in Harnoncourt's
conducting and it made itself felt from the beginning of Friday's Barbican
concert with a trenchant performance of Beethoven's Coriolan Overture.
There was no soloist, which may account for a disappointing audience (though
a noisily appreciative one). The central work was Schumann's Fourth
Symphony, so different in style from Leppard's recent Schumann cycle that
regular Barbican concert-goers might have wondered if they were listening to
the same composer. Where Leppard was fluent and graceful, Harnoncourt dug
into the music with zealous determination.
This is a conductor who always likes to spring a surprise. In Brahms's First
Symphony he did not drive relentlessly along, as one might have expected,
but found time for relaxation as well. If the music still sounded stark, one
suspects that for Harnoncourt overturning a century's tradition of glowing
romantic performances is half the delight. As he raced triumphantly through
the final brass chorale, the adrenalin count hit danger level. Other Brahms
conductors, beware.
Education work in the community has become a prime responsibility of
Britain's orchestras, but it costs money. On Monday the London Symphony
Orchestra held a gala concert in aid of the LSO Endowment Fund to raise
support for its education programme and invited Jessye Norman as the star
attraction - a useful insurance policy if the ticket prices are going to be
that high.
A solo recital on the South Bank earlier this year proved that Jessye Norman
can fill a hall alone at prices most orchestras in this country would long
to charge for large-scale symphony concerts. As that occasion showed, she
has been adventurous in learning new music, while the spontaneity has been
going out of the old. Perhaps a singer needs constant renewal as an artist
to keep up the momentum.
For this concert she was joined by Colin Davis, LSO principal
conductor-elect and a long-time colleague (they share a record company).
They had put together a programme equally shared between two composers,
tempting speculation that each of them would excel in one half: Britten for
him, Strauss for her. Of course, it never works out that simply.
Britten's late cantata Phaedra was written for a mezzo (Janet Baker) and has
usually been sung by mezzos, but it falls very comfortably for Jessye
Norman's low-ish soprano. Alone of the singers I have heard in it, she
experienced no strain at the top. The very fullness of the voice adds
another side to the character. In some of her singing of late, the extrovert
outward signs of involvement have concealed a deadness at the core, but not
here: Phaedra's inner torment and shame were fully alive, the beating heart
of a rounded portrayal.
There was no lack of heart in her Strauss, the closing scene from Capriccio.
In fact, the sheer generosity of the voice and the personality was too much
of a good thing. There is a cool, elegant poise written into the music of
Strauss's Countess, which is smothered if the vocal line bulges with heated
emotion and verbal emphasis. True Strauss stylists like Janowitz take a more
refined line. Nevertheless, Jessye Norman was in lustrous voice. The star
appeal still shines brightly.
In between came two orchestral items which were definitely not fillers. It
is a luxury to hear the Four Sea Interludes from Britten's Peter Grimes
played by a top orchestra and the LSO showed what a difference it makes. The
partnership with Davis is promising a splendid future, his mature wisdom and
their panache combining in a fine performance of Strauss's Don Juan. If the
LSO continues to play as well as this, it can be the star in its own gala
concert next time.
LSO concert sponsored by American Airlines; it is repeated on March 17

FT  16 MAR 94 / Arts: 'Etoiles' go for gold - Ballet in Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Paris Opera Ballet occasionally gives its brightest young dancers a run
of special performances in which to show their very considerable mettle. So,
at the weekend, the aspirant etoiles, feet as bright as their hopes,
technique as burnished as their confidence in their training, made a bid for
glory. It was, as always, an exhilarating spectacle. The Palais Garnier was
crowded and the atmosphere charged with that special French belief in
gloire. And on Saturday afternoon the young went for gold.
Chief ballet-master Patrice Bart centred this year's sessions around the
Romantic ballet. So there was Bournonville, looking - shall we say  - a bit
French-polished, and evocations of Marie Taglioni's roles; the enchanting
Vivandiere sextet which has survived for a century and a half thanks to
notation, and Petipa's Paquita trio. We saw golden gifts; we must hope for
golden futures and golden rewards. Certainly the performance demonstrated
the grace and security of French training - the Opera's ballet school
produces superb talent year after year - and the technical and artistic
assurance that the Opera engenders in its dancers.
The style is Franco-Italian, brilliant in beaten steps and turns, stylish
and sophisticated as to feet - the girls have virtues in point-work
undreamed of by British teaching. There is nothing unemphatic or unduly
modest about what we see, and no English Missery (I'm tempted to write
'English misery'). The young are there on stage because they want to
succeed; failings have to do with a desire for public approval: but
regardez-moi is not the worst of mottos. Lyricism is at a premium - a famous
dancer described it to me as 'dancing too slowly' - while that grandeur of
scale and phrasing we admire with Russian training is largely absent.
But in matter of polish, of physical wit and clarity - the language fast,
light, quickly accented - the Jeunes danseurs are a delight. I loved the
sextet from Napoli, done with southern vivacity, and was charmed by Sandrine
Henault's exquisite feet in the Flower Festival in Genzano duet: every step
was diamond-cut. Her partner was Eric Camillo, buoyant, beautifully sure,
and playing with real charm. Equally fine Bertrand Belem, who sizzled
through devilish solos in La Vivandiere, and Paquita, and Gil Isoart as
James in the second act of La Sylphide. Why, conscience asks, cannot our
young Royal Ballet aspirants do as well?
The Opera's other young virtuoso is Emmanuel Thibault. I reported on him
last year. Slight in build, he has a technique which dazzles by its easy
elegance as by its prowess. In the Napoli pas, and then in a fragment from
Le Papillon, he showed a phenomenal facility - a circuit of the stage
interspersing racing leaps with tight, clear pirouettes was astonishing. He
is teacher's pet, seemingly able to do with grace whatever he is asked, and
unspoiled and gentle in manner. He comes to life as he dances: curtain calls
suggest a young man almost shy of applause.
He was partnered in Le Papillon by Veronique Doisneau, ideally matched with
him in lightness, speed, and a sweet fragility, her dancing as effortless
and beguiling as his. Very pretty, too, the sylphide sketched by Miteki
Kudo, leading her James through the glens of Bournonville's second act, and
turning and posing with delicious innocence. Grandly soaring was Sandrine
Marache, who bounded proudly through a Vivandiere solo. My only complaint
about the performance is the fact that Anton Dolin's version of the Pas de
Quatre in which four divinities of London's ballet in 1845 were brought
together in a contest of charm and steely temperament, was lightly guyed.
The steps, like the Pugni score, are pretty, and need to be prettily danced.
The mock rivalries, and the mopping and mowing between Saturday's
participants, was all too roguey-poguey. Real-life tensions among ballerinas
who have incarnated their great predecessors have been more subtly masked
and far deadlier than this warfare of pink tulle and moues.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Business and the Environment: Lasagne recipe for soil
renewal - A new technique for salvaging contaminated land is being tested in
the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A novel approach to one of the US's most common but most intractable
environmental problems is being tested by a team of scientists at a US
federal uranium-processing facility in Kentucky.
The field test has nothing to do with radioactive waste or nuclear safety,
however. The scientists are seeking a process for cleaning up leaked fuel,
industrial solvents and other substances that have contaminated the soil at
thousands of sites in the US. The technology raises new hope that many of
these areas of land can return to productive use. It also promises to speed
up the faltering 14-year effort to clean up the worst of the areas.
'One of the things that has hampered progress is a slow pace of
technological innovation,' says Bill Roberts, a toxic waste expert at the
Environmental Defence Fund, a private lobbying group. Of the 1,200 to 1,300
sites designated as the most dangerous under the Superfund programme, set up
in 1980 by the US government's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to
clean up contaminated land, about 200 have been reclaimed so far.
The new technique, known as the lasagne process, involves using electrical
current to draw wastes through 'treatment zones' in the soil. Toxic waste
materials can often be rendered harmless in the zones, which resemble the
layers of a lasagne, without being brought to the surface. Scientists say
the process is effective in densely packed soils that are nearly impossible
to reclaim with current techniques. It may also prove cheaper and safer.
As part of a wider initiative announced in January by the EPA, the project
highlights the Clinton administration's policy of encouraging co-operation
between the public and private sectors and among rival companies in the
fight against pollution. Three big US industrial groups, Monsanto, DuPont
and General Electric, have taken leading roles in the project, together with
the EPA and the Department of Energy.
'The common denominator of the primary collaborators was that we each had
difficult and expensive soil clean-up problems to deal with and were
frustrated by the lack of cost-effective technology to do the job,' says
Philip Brodsky, director of corporate research and environmental technology
at Monsanto, the big US chemical group. 'The EPA's willingness to play a
matchmaker role was critical in getting the process rolling.'
Soil remediation lends itself to joint research and development. 'There are
economies of scale that come into play here,' Roberts says. 'There is no
long-term return in a company investing in this kind of new technology by
itself.'
The effectiveness of the lasagne process has yet to be demonstrated,
however, with testing so far limited to small-scale trials. The Kentucky
site where its evaluation begins this spring was chosen because it is
typical. In an isolated storage area at the facility, the solvent
trichloro-ethylene, widely used as a paint-stripper, has penetrated the
dense soil. The EPA says it will be 'a couple of years' before comparisons
of the process's cost and efficacy can be made.
Currently, the main approach to dealing with contaminated land is to
excavate the toxic material and either incinerate it or seal it in
watertight pits. However, toxic substances, leaking from ruptured tanks, for
example, may spread deep below the surface. The expense is also prohibitive,
and the risk of human exposure is great.
If the contamination is deep, but the soil is relatively permeable, wastes
may have collected in ground water, which can be pumped to the surface and
neutralised. But in soils with impermeable clay layers, so-called 'pump and
treat' methods are ineffective. Residual contamination usually infiltrates
fissures in the hard clay below the ground water and eventually seeps back
in.
The lasagne process may provide a solution in such cases. Brodsky, who
initiated the project, says various geological conditions are present in
most sites and it is impossible to pinpoint which may be suitable for the
lasagne treatment. But the technology may contribute to an overall solution
in a substantial proportion of them.
Brodsky's idea was to combine three existing technologies.
First, a process called electro-osmosis flushes the contaminants out of the
clay fissures. A cathode is inserted into the ground, which emits
low-voltage electrical current that pulls the positive ions in the waste
droplets at the rate of about once inch a day.
Second, a series of 'treatment zones' - the lasagne's layers - are carved in
the soil. The top and bottom strata are filled with an electrical conductor,
such as graphite. Waste gathers in the middle layers when the current is
switched on.
The third step deals with the contaminated material once it is there. Often,
catalysts are available to help convert hazardous compounds to benign
substances once inside the treatment zones. Alternatively, 'bioremediation'
systems to degrade the waste organically are being developed by a number of
companies, including Monsanto, DuPont and GE. Another option, used in the
Kentucky test, is to put activated carbon in the treatment zones to absorb
the contaminants.
The new technology has surfaced at a propitious time. Last month, the EPA
proposed sweeping revisions of the Superfund law, following widespread
perception that it has failed to achieve many of its goals.
Among its proposals, the EPA would ease standards for cleaning up some
Superfund sites in an effort to encourage redevelopment of abandoned land.
More importantly, the new accent on flexibility is likely to spill over into
state and federal rules applying to cleaning up the thousands of waste sites
not covered by the Superfund programme.
Even if the lasagne project fails, Brodsky believes the joint effort will
continue. 'The collaborative paradigm has already proved very productive,'
he says, citing advances in bioremediation, soil flushing and other areas.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Business and the Environment: Big boys' game comes under
fire - Germany's national recycling scheme faces growing attack / Worldwide
Waste
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wuppertal, a smoky town in the recession-hit coal mining region of northern
Germany, is hardly inspiring. But for Ernst von Weizsacker, one of Germany's
most prominent environmentalists, this is just the place for an institute
devoted to the fight against pollution.
Von Weizsacker, of the Wuppertal Institute for Climatology, recently
announced that he was retiring as president of the advisory council of
Duales System Deutschland (DSD), Germany's three-year-old national recycling
scheme.
Von Weizsacker calls Germany's most ambitious environmental project a
'dangerous manipulation' which 'serves the throw-away society'. He has
joined the swelling chorus of critics who claim that the waste disposal
scheme is misconceived.
Von Weizsacker's criticism is directed at the monopolistic structure that
characterises DSD and makes the country's recycling industry increasingly
concentrated in the hands of a few utilities and energy groups.
DSD was created in 1991 by 600 companies in response to the packaging law
drawn up by Klaus Topfer, the environment minister. This makes manufacturers
and retailers responsible for collection and recycling of packaging waste.
It also sets collection and recycling quotas, which increase over time and
must be enforced nationally.
Industrial groups in Germany set up DSD as a national waste collection
scheme, which signed contracts with waste recyclers. To meet the cost of
collection, DSD imposes a fee, borne mostly by consumers through higher
prices and shown as a green dot on packaging.
Because the law insisted the system should be nationwide, DSD quickly spread
to nearly all German cities. Few German households are without the special
yellow bins for packaging waste with green dots.
Three years after its creation, DSD's quasi-monopoly has angered
middle-sized German recyclers and environmentalists who say the giant waste
collector is squeezing out of a profitable market the small players who
represent a pool of innovation for new environmentally friendly recycling
technologies.
The Federal Cartel Office has admitted there is a problem but argues that
DSD is only fulfilling the packaging law. Undaunted, the medium-sized
companies are intensifying their lobbying efforts within government circles.
They point out that in 1992, more than 140 waste management companies were
acquired by larger groups, compared with 60 in 1990.
The medium-sized companies are also protesting against 10-year contracts
signed by DSD with municipalities and with the large utilities and energy
groups. 'Innovation and market strategies for recycling specific waste
products no longer have a chance,' explains the federal association of
medium-sized companies (BVMW). The association is proposing continuous
tender processes and price negotiations, which would allow them to bid for
DSD contracts. They add that such measures would also open the market to
foreign competition.
Waste disposal companies created by municipalities now make up one in three
of DSD's clients. 'Municipalities immediately saw a tremendous source of
revenue in this business and made sure the contracts did not escape them,'
says Franz-Josef Fraundorfer, managing director in the German office of
Arthur D Little, the consultancy group.
Large utilities and energy groups have also moved into waste recycling. RWE
Entsorgung, the waste management subsidiary of RWE, Germany's biggest
utility group, has a turnover of more than DM2bn (Pounds 700m). Three years
old, it has acquired 100 companies in its expansion drive, and DSD accounts
for 15 per cent of its business.
Other German concerns have also stepped in, with Veba, the Dusseldorf-based
energy group, processing 120,000 tonnes of plastics in a recycling plant
linked to its oil refinery in Bottrop. And Thyssen Handelsunion, a
subsidiary of Thyssen, the big engineering and steel group, is involved in
building up recycling plants in eastern Germany.
These groups argue that the future of waste disposal in Germany lies with
those who can invest large sums in complicated recycling plants. High
investments also justify long-term contracts, DSD officials say.
According to the Environmental Council, an advisory body to the federal
states, four or five companies are likely to share some 40 per cent of the
domestic waste market in coming years.
DSD says the concentration process in the industry had started before it
came into being,
but medium-sized companies claim the DSD's structure favours large
companies. 'DSD is dominated by companies such as Unilever and Procter &amp;
Gamble who have no interest in meddling with the small players. It is a big
boys' game,' says one entrepreneur.
Meanwhile, the government has ignored critics from the smaller companies.
Topfer says his packaging law achieved a 13 per cent drop in packaging waste
in Germany in 1993.

FT  16 MAR 94 / People: NatWest's newest customer runs the bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Even before taking up his role in the new post of finance director for
National Westminster's UK branch business, Paul Biddle has a related task to
perform: to become a NatWest customer himself.
In moving from being finance director for Digital Equipment, the computer
group, Biddle sees himself becoming a NatWest bank customer but not a
banker.
He says that he regards 'the business I'm joining as fundamentally a
retailing business - it just happens to be financial products they're
selling'.
He believes his new job - which he takes up in mid-April - will enable him
to draw on his experience in industry.
He has worked for Unilever and Rank Xerox, following his training as a
chartered accountant.
The priority he sees for the years ahead will be to find the right balance
of ways of distributing products to customers, through electronic and
telephone banking, as well as the traditional branch network.
Martin Gray, chief executive of NatWest's UK branch banking, said that
Biddle's responsibilities would include developing and setting the financial
strategy for retail banking operations; managing the budget planning; and
liaising with other parts of the group on long and short-term financial
strategies.
In creating this new role is NatWest implying it may have missed out in the
past, through not having a finance director for the UK branch business?
Biddle says only that he suspects they have not put in place the appropriate
management processes - such as planning and budgeting - which are 'almost
taken for granted in the industrial environment'.

FT  16 MAR 94 / People: Perlin leaves Sears and goes shopping for himself
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
House-cleaning continues at the top of Sears with the resignation of Howard
Perlin, the director in charge of acquisitions and disposals; he has been on
the board since 1984.
Perlin started seven years before that as personal assistant to Geoffrey
Maitland Smith, then chief executive and now chairman.
Perlin, 47, says that, having masterminded the disposal of Satellite
Information Services last month, he has brought the group to 'where it wants
to get, for the moment', with the business focused on retailing and home
shopping.
Since Liam Strong came in as chief executive in early 1992, there has been a
rapid turnover of executive directors. Aside from Roger Groom, who came on
to the board in 1991, Perlin was the only executive director who remained
from the pre-Strong era. Strong's own difficulties in changing the culture
at Sears were illustrated towards the end of last year when Stephen Park,
the finance director he had brought in from Hanson just 16 months
previously, resigned.
Perlin, who joined Sears from First National Finance Corporation, reckons he
has 'probably gathered more experience than most merchant bankers, having
completed approaching 100 transactions, including 30 MBOs' in his time with
the group. Disposals in which he had a hand included William Hill and Asprey
and he was also involved in the acquisition of Freemans.
He now plans to put this to good use by setting up his own private
consultancy - very much a one-man-band - with the aim of providing corporate
finance and business strategy advice across a range of industries. He is
also building up a portfolio of non-executive directorships, and has one
public company already appointment lined up.

FT  16 MAR 94 / People: Wheatley joins with Ashtead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Alan Wheatley, a former senior London partner of Price Waterhouse, has been
appointed a non-executive director and deputy chairman of Ashtead group, the
fast-growing plant hire company.
Ashtead, which began as a Pounds 458,000 management buy-out ten years ago,
was floated on the unlisted securities market in November 1986 and was the
last winner of the USM company of the year award. Its market capitalisation
has risen from Pounds 8m to Pounds 127m and pre-tax profits have jumped from
Pounds 533,000 to around Pounds 5.2m in the current year, according to some
stock market estimates.
Chairman Peter Lewis, 53, who founded the company with managing director
George Burnett, 46, says that the company has grown to a stage where it
needs a non-executive director with 'bigger company experience'. Wheatley,
55, who stepped down as chairman of 3i last year, is a non-executive
director of NM Rothschild, British Steel, Forte and Legal &amp; General.

FT  16 MAR 94 / People: Carlton adjusts its managerial contrast
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Carlton Communications moved yesterday to integrate the management structure
of its ITV operations following its recent acquisition of Central
Independent Television.
Andy Allan, right, managing director of Central, is to become chief
executive of Carlton UK Television from mid-April. A new managing director
of Central Television, yet to be appointed, will report to Allan, who will
also be responsible for the sales operation of the two ITV franchises, the
largest in the ITV network.
Allan, 51, has worked in broadcasting for nearly 30 years, beginning as a
presenter and producer and later becoming a programme editor in the light
entertainment department of ABC television. He is a former head of news at
Thames Television and joined Central as director of programmes in 1984 from
Tyne Tees Television, where he had been director of programmes and deputy
managing director. He is also a governor of the National Film and Television
School
Nigel Walmsley, the present chief executive of Carlton Television and an
administrator rather than a programme-maker, will move to the headquarters
of Carlton Communications as the main board director, with overall
responsibility for group broadcasting.
Both Carlton Television and Central will continue to operate under separate
boards, as part of the terms of their broadcasting licences.
'The opportunity to take responsibility for ITV's two largest broadcasters
is irresistible,' says Allan. Leslie Hill, chairman of the ITV Association
for the next two years, remains chairman of Central.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Management: Seven strategies to change your company - There
is more than one way to tackle organisational upheaval. Adrian Furnham
considers the options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN FURNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The trouble with the idea and practice of organisational change is that it
is both boring and anxiety provoking. The number of magazine and newspaper
articles, courses, memos and self-help books dealing with change is
overwhelming.
'Adapt or die; change or decay' is not a simple rallying cry for the senior
manager, it is a reality. But the question is how to bring about successful
change to maximise effectiveness and minimise pain.
Managers choose different strategies with varying consequences.
The fellowship strategy: This approach relies heavily on interpersonal
relations, using seminars, dinners and events to announce and discuss what
needs to be changed and how. People at all levels are listened to,
supposedly treated equally and conflicting opinions are expressed. This
'warm and fuzzy' approach emphasises personal commitment over ideas - the
change process may have serious problems getting going as a consequence.
Because this strategy is averse to conflict it can miss crucial issues and
even waste time. Many fellowship-types leave the organisation and can only
be replaced by those who have a need to belong.
The political strategy: Here the power structure is targeted by attempting
to influence the official and unofficial leaders. The strategy seeks to
identify and persuade those in the organisation who are most respected and
who have large constituencies. Political strategists flatter, bargain and
compromise to achieve their ends. But this de-stabilises the organisation
because of ongoing shifts in people's political stances. Maintaining
credibility can be difficult because the strategy is so obviously devious.
Getting people to show their true colours in this way is never simple.
The economic strategy: The cynical economist believes that money is the best
persuader. The person who controls the purse strings can buy or change
anything. Everybody has a price. This is the rational 'homo-economicus'
approach that assumes people act more or less logically but that their logic
is based on economic motives. But 'buying people off' can be costly and the
effects short-term. The strategy also ignores emotional issues and all
questions besides bottom-line profit.
The academic strategy: This approach assumes that if you present people with
enough information and the correct facts they will accept the need to
change. The academic strategist commissions studies and reports from
employees, experts and consultants. Although such strategists are happy to
share their findings it is difficult to mobilise energy and resources after
the analysis phase. Analysis paralysis often results because the study phase
lasts too long and the results and recommendations are frequently out of
date when they are published.
The engineering strategy: This is the technocratic approach that assumes
that if the physical nature of a job is changed, enough people will be
forced to change. The strong emphasis on the structural aspects of problems
leads to a sensitivity to the environment which is particularly helpful in
unstable situations. The concern over channels of communication can prompt
structural change, but fails to commit most people. Most people do not like
being treated as machines and hence do not feel committed. Such change can
also break up happy and efficient teams. The strategy is limited because
only high-level managers can really understand it, it is impersonal and it
ignores the question: What is in this for me?
The military strategy: This approach is reliant on brute force and sometimes
ignorance. It is at times used by the military and the police, students,
pressure groups and political parties. The emphasis is on learning to use
the weapons for the fight. Physical strength and agility are required and
following the plan is rewarded. But the change-enforcer cannot relax, in
case the imposed change disappears. Furthermore, force is met by force and
the result is ever-escalating violence.
The confrontational strategy: This high-risk strategy reckons that if you
can arouse and then mobilise anger in people to confront the problem, they
will change. Much depends on the strategists' ability to argue the points,
as well as being able to stir up anger without promoting violence. This
approach encourages people to confront problems they would prefer not to
address but tends to focus too much on the problem and not on the solution.
Anger and conflict tend to polarise people and can cause a backlash.
Few of these strategies occur in isolation. But they do have different basic
assumptions about who to influence, how to proceed and what to focus on.
Each tends to be effective at addressing certain change problems but very
bad at dealing with others. The political strategy has problems with
credibility; the economic approach with maintaining change, and the academic
with implementing findings. But for the professional who must demonstrate
his worth to the organisation by implementing change, any of the above might
help him.
The trouble is that strategies tend to be chosen by chief executives for
personal reasons rather than as a result of any well-considered set of
options. An inappropriate strategy may cause more trouble than the initial
reason for change.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Management: The power to choose - How companies can now
control electricity costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Keith Smith, buyer of utilities at the McDonald's fast food chain, is
beaming at a chart of one restaurant's electricity consumption. He likes the
power it gives the company's restaurant managers.
'Look at that,' he says. 'They've done all the right things there. The
consumption falls when it should; the store workers have switched off the
cookers and lights when they do not need them. It's a perfect example to
show to other stores.'
The chart comes courtesy of Eastern Electricity which, from next month, is
to supply power and associated services, including diagrams showing past
consumption, to 500 McDonald's stores in England and Wales.
Eastern's willingness to supply power and other facilities as part of the
service, yet still undercut offers from rival power companies, was one
reason why it won the business.
In the past few months throughout Britain big companies like McDonald's have
been evaluating for the first time a range of offers for power supplies as
they and the suppliers gear up for the next phase in the liberalisation of
the market.
From April 1 any electricity consumer using more than 100 kilowatt hours at
the peak of its demand will be able to buy its supplies from any registered
supplier including the 14 mainland UK distributors and the two England and
Wales generators. Until now they have had to buy power from their local
distributor.
The previous limit of 1 megawatt, 10 times the new threshold, encompassed
only about 5,000 consumers. From April about 50,000, including businesses,
schools, hospitals and leisure centres, will be able to shop around and many
are taking advantage.
More than 7,000 in the 100kW to 1MW market, a fifth of those eligible, have
already made arrangements to take their supplies from a company other than
their regional electricity supplier. The industry expects the figure to
reach about 15,000 within the next year.
Price cuts have reached 20 per cent for a handful but the majority which
have switched are estimated to be making annual savings on their electricity
bills of between 4 and 10 per cent. Many of those which have stayed with
their regional distributor have also gained financially.
But the benefits of the liberalised market are not just in the price.
Companies, or at any rate the large ones, are finding they are in strong
position to demand a tailor-made service which can improve their energy
management.
As a large company, with all the advantages which that brings for bulk
buying, McDonald's was better placed than most prospective buyers - yet it
received offers for the whole country from just four suppliers of the 14
approached.
Smith was impressed by only one company other than Eastern. 'It was apparent
that several suppliers were poorly prepared. There was not the expertise to
deal with the market. One company, for example, had a very good salesman but
poor back-up.
'Several of the offers we received had hidden costs,' says Smith. Some were
able to offer charts showing consumption in each store by the half hour but
they wanted to charge extra, on top of the prices they had quoted, and that
was already more than Eastern's quote.
Smith says McDonald's has become much more conscious of energy costs in the
past two years and now sees the half-hourly breakdown of consumption as an
essential management tool. 'It gives the manager of a store a picture of
what has been happening in the store even at times when he is not there.'
McDonald's estimates that it will save Pounds 1.4m on its energy bill each
year as a result of the deal with Eastern, which is worth about Pounds 18m.
A separate deal in Scotland for the company's 20 stores there is leading to
savings of more than 30 per cent.
Another company taking advantage of the newly competitive UK electricity
market is Stakis, the hotels and casinos group. Stakis will make significant
savings on its electricity bill after a deal with Scottish Hydro-Electric
involving the 25 of its 52 hotels and six casinos which are big enough to be
able to shop around for supplies. It expects its Pounds 2.3m-a-year
electricity bill for the 31 units in the Hydro deal to fall by about Pounds
250,000. Like McDonald's, Stakis was not spoiled for choice. Bill Gunn, in
charge of utilities purchasing for the group, says only the two Scottish
power distribution companies were prepared to make an offer covering hotels
throughout the UK.
Stakis's main requirement was simplicity. 'Electricity bills seem to us to
be far too complicated with different charges for maximum demand, for supply
and for different times of the day. We wanted a uniform price for each unit
of electricity which is the same for all hotels and for that price to
include everything.
'We have limited resources and a single price makes billing far easier to
double check. It is also useful for comparison purposes. If one hotel is
using far more units than another with similar occupancy rates we will know
there is something wrong. Perhaps they leave everything on in the kitchen
overnight.'
Both Hydro-Electric and Scottish Power were able to meet Stakis's request
for uniform prices but Hydro's tender was lower.
Not all companies, however, have found it easy to shop around. At Fowler &amp;
Holden, John Hardy, managing director, badgered electricity suppliers for
several months before he received an offer he considered may be acceptable.
'At first I could not get suppliers to compete,' he says. 'They seemed only
interested in making decent offers to large companies. But large companies
are my competitors and if they are getting big cuts in their electricity
bills I want them too.'
The first six offers made to Fowler would have resulted in its power bill
remaining at about Pounds 26,000 a year. It was only this week when one
company, Powerline, the Midlands Electricity subsidiary, revised an earlier
proposed deal to produce annual savings of about Pounds 2,000.
The lateness of the proposed offer means Fowler will be unable to change
supplier until after April 1, since the electricity authorities need 20
working days' notice. Hardy says the delay has been worthwhile. 'Unless we
had been prepared to wait, the introduction of competition would have meant
virtually nothing to us.'

FT  16 MAR 94 / Recruitment: The permanent temp is a Handyman - As a new
style of organisation emerges from the recession, companies are turning to
temporary managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How hard do you need to work at getting a job? Most people have heard of
aspirants firing off scores of applications and of advertisements attracting
hundreds of inquiries, even for quite lowly posts.
There is nothing unusual about the committed job seeker, but the trend
towards more flexible workforces and slimmer companies is influencing
individual approaches to employment.
Richard McKeown has gone one step further than chasing every vacancy,
turning his skills as a chartered secretary into an aggressively marketed
business service aimed at short-term employment opportunities. McKeown, 46,
who lives in Uxbridge, west London, was made redundant in 1987 after the
company he worked for moved to south Wales and he decided not to go with it.
He invested Pounds 7,000 with an outplacement agency which did not find him
a job but which gave him valuable advice about interviews and how to write a
CV.
Since 1988 he has had a series of temporary contracts in the company
secretarial role and is now completing a short stint as a temporary
assistant company secretary at Kingfisher.
McKeown's name is registered with three recruitment agencies but he has gone
beyond being merely a hopeful job applicant. He spends Pounds 5,000 a year
on marketing himself. This includes employing a public relations expert.
He produces a glossy brochure advertising his skills, experience, previous
employers, selected references and the work he is capable of doing. He is,
in his own words, 'the all singing, all dancing one-man band'.
McKeown may be the manager of the future; the sort of individual whom
management philosopher Charles Handy, writes about in his new book, The
Empty Raincoat.
Handy talks about a portfolio approach to life where you decide how much you
want to work, how you want to work and where you want to work. Newly
restructured organisations, he has observed, are moving increasingly towards
the employment of fee-charging professionals.
A whole new employment industry has sprung up over the past 10-15 years to
provide temporary - or 'interim' - managers.
Many do not see themselves as temporary workers in the long term but are
prepared to fulfil such roles until a permanent post comes along. McKeown
claims to have 'crossed the Rubicon' in this respect and now sees himself as
a permanent temp.
He says he does not feel insecure, has never been despairing and is relaxed
about his prospects. His experience as an itinerant employee is growing. His
former clients include BTR, Lautro and Mercury Communications.
The use of temporary staff started in Silicon Valley in the US among
start-up companies. They employed a core of essential staff on a permanent
basis and made up the rest of their workforce with temporary contractors.
Now the strategy is spreading to individual managers.
McKeown argues that it can be good for professionals because they can
command higher fees than they would get on a salaried basis. It can be good
for the company because it is buying a short-term and often essential stop
gap at a fixed price. The downside for the employer would seem to be cost
and, to some extent, uncertainty about quality, although the temporary
nature of the employment lessens the potential damage of recruiting a dud.
Jeff Grout, managing director of Robert Half, which has about 500 temporary
accountants on its books, says: 'As companies have come out of the recession
they are not rushing to recruit staff back on a permanent basis.
'The traditional temp has changed dramatically. It used to be in low-level
grades but there are now some very senior people doing it.'
Charles Russam, managing director of the GMS consultancy and secretary of
the Association of Temporary and Interim Executive Services, says his
company database lists 3,500 executives to supply companies that need senior
business managers at director level or one level below.
He estimates the executive leasing or interim management sector is worth
between Pounds 70m and Pounds 100m in the UK and that it is growing at about
20 per cent a year as it is increasingly viewed as a serious alternative to
long-term employees. He says: 'Interim management is no longer being seen as
the recycling of clapped out executives but as a credible option for
business.
'Businesses are saying to themselves why do I need to keep such people on my
payroll when I can go into the market and get someone in to do a specific
job.'
But how do you avoid getting a useless manager attempting to revive a
washed-up career? Russam admits that such people have found their way on to
agency books. His own company, he says, will no longer list anyone for whom
it does not have three satisfactory references.
As registered employment agencies, such companies take their fees from
employers. 'It means that we owe a duty of care to our clients so it is in
our interests to ensure that the people we are supplying are of a good
calibre,' says Russam.
Interest in temporary managers is growing, he says, among expanding small
businesses which need hands-on management help, often on a part-time basis.
Use of the temporary professional has expanded markedly in the field of
information technology. About 20,000 to 30,000 freelance employees are
working in this area in the UK, with about 20 agencies marketing their
services. The biggest operator, CSS-Comac, has about 1,100 people working.
Tony Coombes, professional services director of Systems Resources of
Coventry, which has about 500 contract staff working for employers such as
IBM, says quality control is becoming increasingly important as customer
companies are demanding good people and consistency from suppliers.
'Everyone we place is an ambassador of the company. If they don't do well,
manufacturers will blame us,' he says.
The company has become rigorous with its contractors. All conversations with
freelances discussing their abilities are recorded afterwards and kept on
file. 'It may appear big brotherish but it's not. It is really a way of
making a quality selection against the requirement the client gives us,'
Coombes says.
Contracts tend to be for three months. Employees do not have the holiday
arrangements that their full-time colleagues enjoy but the trade-off in job
security tends to be higher salaries. Computer operators in the Pounds
15,000 to Pounds 20,000 salary range may find themselves earning the
equivalent of between Pounds 20,000 and Pounds 28,000 a week for the
duration of the contract. Experienced programmers will be earning the
equivalent of Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 45,000 a year compared with Pounds
20,000 to Pounds 30,000 in a full-time post.
Richard McKeown agrees that the fees commanded by temporary professionals
are higher than full-time salaries. The fee, he says, has to account for
personal overheads, self-provision of pensions, holidays and car. He also
feels justified in including an additional element to reflect his
availability at short notice.
One of the biggest problems for individuals, he argues, is adopting the
frame of mind that accepts temporary contract working as the norm. To do
this, he believes it is necessary to build up capital that can be used as a
buffer for the times when demand is quiet.
He says: 'There is a vast pool of highly qualified people out there. They
might have come to to it through redundancy, but so what? I think I'm better
at my job now than I was 10 years ago. It has been a positive experience.'

FT  16 MAR 94 / Benefit split could lift women's income
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Social security reforms could raise women's incomes at little cost to the
Exchequer and without discouraging women from taking up work, the Institute
for Fiscal Studies, the independent think-tank, says in a study published
yesterday.
The study, conducted for the Equal Opportunities Commission, examines
several proposals. It estimates that one proposal, splitting income support
payments equally between partners, would not increase government spending on
benefits but would give two-thirds of women with children in unemployed
couples a gain of more than Pounds 10 a week.
IFS programme director Mr Steven Webb said: 'Our research shows that
carefully constructed reforms can increase women's financial independence
and have little disincentive effects on part-time work.'
But the study warns against simply increasing social security benefits. It
says that introducing a new 'non-worker's benefit', for example, of Pounds
25 per week for all individuals including married women not in paid
employment would cost up to Pounds 7bn and encourage some women to give up
their existing low-paid part-time work.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Tourism body calls for wind farm curb
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Restrictions on wind farms are backed by the Wales Tourist Board today in a
strategy for tourism in the principality, Roland Adburgham writes.
Wind farms, which use turbines to harness the wind and provide an
alternative source of energy, face increasing opposition from Welsh local
authorities and residents concerned about visual intrusion and noise of the
turbines.
In its Tourism 2000 strategy document - to be launched today by Mr John
Redwood, Welsh secretary - the board says: 'The quality of Wales's natural
environment is one of the industry's greatest assets.
'Tourism 2000 recognises the need to conserve and enhance that environment
and is concerned about threats which might impact upon the industry, for
example wind farms.' It endorses the policies of the Countryside Council for
Wales, which opposes wind farms in national parks and other special areas.
Wales has eight wind farms and planning consent is being sought for many
more.
The board hopes its strategy will create 10,000 jobs and increase tourism
earnings by Pounds 700m by 2000. Tourism now contributes Pounds 1.3bn, or 6
per cent, of gross domestic product.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Best-selling trust to suffer yield cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A group offering a 10 per cent return on its best-selling trust has warned
70,000 investors that it will cut the yield to 9 per cent from June 28.
The high-income unit trust offered by fund manager Foreign &amp; Colonial has
pulled in more than Pounds 500m since its launch just over a year ago.
It was particularly attractive to income seekers and heavily promoted by
many financial intermediaries because of the 10 per cent yield.
Such funds, which obtain an unusually high income, have been highly
controversial because they can procure such high returns only at the expense
of the capital growth prospects. Many experts believe savers' capital could
actually be eroded in order to keep the income flowing.
Over the past year, anyone investing in the F&amp;C fund would have lost roughly
10 per cent of their initial investment - neatly cancelling out the benefit
of the 10 per cent income. Most conventional equity income funds have
produced a significantly better return.
Mr Simon James, F&amp;C director, said the decision to cut the target yield on
the fund was mainly because the group expects interest rates to move lower
this year. He added that the group also wants to give investors plenty of
notice of the impending cut in yield.
F&amp;C has also trimmed its management charge from 1.5 per cent to 1.25 per
cent with effect from April 6.
Rival fund manager Morgan Grenfell, whose high income trust closely
resembles the F&amp;C fund, said it had no intention of reducing the 10 per cent
yield on its fund, or of cutting its 1.5 per cent management charge. The
Morgan Grenfell fund, launched last September, has so far attracted around
Pounds 40m. The Morgan Grenfell fund has also lost value since its launch:
investors who bought at 25p a unit would get back Pounds 23.52p at last
night's prices.
Save &amp; Prosper, another leading fund management group, cancelled its plans
for a similar fund last December. It argued then that the chances of capital
erosion were unacceptably high. This week Mr Ken Emery, Save and Prosper
technical director, said: 'It looks as if our concerns are being confirmed,
although it is obviously too early for judgment to be passed.'

FT  16 MAR 94 / Design Council to axe 75% of staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS and MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Design Council, the government-funded body which provides design
services to industry, is to cut its staff from 200 to 50, close its five
regional offices and transfer many of its industrial functions to the
national network of one-stop business service centres known as Business
Links.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said the council was
'out of keeping' with the government's aim to bring services to businesses
on a local level and announced yesterday that Pounds 6m was to be
ring-fenced over the next three years for the promotion of design through
the Business Links.
It is also understood that the Design Council's budget could be reduced from
about Pounds 7.5m a year to just under Pounds 4m beginning in 1995.
The announcement follows a four-month review led by the Design Council's
chairman, Mr John Sorrell, a designer and former chairman of the Design
Business Association.
The council will cease to provide services, many of which will pass to the
private sector. Instead, says a review document published yesterday, the
council will become 'an organisation with the attitude and capacity to
inspire and orchestrate action by others'.
The council will advise and monitor the 200 planned Business Links, which
will bring together the functions of Training and Enterprise Councils,
chambers of commerce, local authorities and the Enterprise Agency.
Mr Heseltine said that the regional Business Links would be better able to
cater for those small businesses which would not 'naturally find their way'
to the Haymarket offices of the council.
The restructured council, intended for relaunch in a December, its 50th
anniversary, will continue to act as the UK's authority on design. It will
also conduct research and develop design education and training.
Mr Sorrell said yesterday that the refocused council would build on the best
of the past. 'We are creating a new council which is smaller and will be
very fleet of foot,' he said.
The council is still in its consultation period on staff decisions, but
hopes to redeploy some of its central office workers into the private sector
or into Business Links. It is not yet known how many will be made redundant.
Mr Harminder Sing, regional officer for MSF, the union for the council's
workers, said: 'Our major concern is that the expertise that the Design
Council has built up is being dispersed. If it is fragmented then you lose
the benefits of one unit - the synergy, the effectiveness, and the
cross-fertilisation of ideas.'
The Confederation of British Industry and the Chartered Society of Designers
welcomed the review's conclusions yesterday, though both expressed
reservations about the details of passing on industrial services to Business
Links.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Tea Time sells for Pounds 100,050
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A painting of a mother and child by the American Impressionist Karl Buehr
sold for Pounds 100,050 at Phillips in London yesterday. 'Tea Time' had been
estimated at Pounds 2,000-Pounds 3,000 but aroused considerable interest,
with 10 telephone bidders.
It eventually went to the New York dealer James Berry Hill. Buehr worked in
Giverny in France in the early 20th century and his last work at auction,
offered at Chicago last year, sold for just Pounds 559.
At Christie's an auction of more than 200 pictures of birds was 89 per cent
sold by value. However an important painting by the leading bird artist,
Archibald Thorburn, of 'European Mallard and Teal in Winter', went below
estimate for Pounds 24,150.
The art market is picking up after a long recession when sellers were
reluctant to offer works for auction. Among the stronger sectors is
furniture, and in New York at the weekend Sotheby's sold an English
marquetry side cabinet for Dollars 184,380 (Pounds 122,500), double its
estimate.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Manx VAT is cut to boost tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUE STUART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Value added tax is to be cut on some tourism-related services in the Isle of
Man in a bid to boost the industry, Mr Donald Gelling, the Manx Treasury
minister, said yesterday.
Presenting the island's 1994 budget, Mr Gelling also announced a six-month
penalty and interest remission scheme from April 6 for those with income tax
and VAT liabilities relating to income omitted or understated in
declarations since April 1987.
The treasury hopes the amnesty, designed to enable people and companies to
regularise their liabilities without incurring penalties or interest
charges, will produce several million pounds of estimated outstanding tax
debts.
Mr Gelling insisted that the lower VAT rate, levied after negotiations with
the UK, would not apply to goods that could be exported to the UK mainland.
The Manx treasury is believed to be considering levying the lower rate on
hotel accommodation and restaurant meals.
The Isle of Man, a Crown dependency with its own parliament, the Tynwald,
has a customs and excise agreement with the UK under which VAT is levied at
the same rates and on the same items as in the UK. The amount raised is
passed to the UK and the Isle of Man receives a rebate calculated on its
population.
Mr Gelling said yesterday: 'I have been able to agree (with the UK) a degree
of flexibility on some tourist-related non-exportable services. Our
objective is to ensure that this hard-won flexibility is best used to
stimulate economic activity and growth.'
He said he hoped to finalise details before the end of the summer to allow
the island's flagging tourist industry time to prepare adjusted price levels
for next year.
Mr Gelling said the recession on the island had bottomed out. 'Company and
VAT registrations are up and there is increased economic activity.'
Net expenditure for the coming year is estimated at Pounds 200.5m, to be
balanced by income of Pounds 193.7m and Pounds 7.66m of unspent capital
brought forward from last year. This year's capital expenditure programme is
Pounds 42.61m, and the island's reserve fund will be maintained at Pounds
66.51m.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Sidelined by static income and narrowing remit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Design Council was established by Winston Churchill's wartime government
in 1944 as the Council of Industrial Design, with a remit for 'the
advancement of British industry by the improvement of the design of its
products'.
This was to be accomplished by encouraging industry and commerce to
understand the positive effect good design can have on market performance.
For 40 years the remit was interpreted by the council and the Department of
Trade and Industry, its sponsoring department, as covering the need to
educate the public, as well as industry and commerce.
To the public the council became best known for its shop in London's
Haymarket and the triangular label it awarded to selected consumer products
which met a wide range of criteria for good design. This helped earn the
council a high public profile, especially during the 1970s, although the
organisation's impact on the quality of design in industry remained
questionable until the early 1980s.
From the mid 1980s, the council's government grant came under growing
pressure in spite of the declared passion for design of Baroness Thatcher,
who was then prime minister. In 1988 the council responded to this pressure
by dropping most of its public-awareness activities in agreement with the
DTI. The shop was closed and the label dropped.
The council continued to provide design teaching materials and advice to
schools, but focused most of its activities on services to industry and
commerce. To reach small and medium-sized companies more effectively, its
network of regional offices was also strengthened.
The council's refocusing of activities was intended to make better use of
its annual grant and DTI income, which have remained roughly static for
several years at about Pounds 7.5m in total.
But narrowing its activities had two side-effects. It virtually removed the
council from the view of politicians and other opinion-formers, and it
reinforced the impression that it was drifting away from its broad design
remit to an excessive concern with engineering aspects of design. As a
result, when the DTI decided to transfer the council's direct industrial
services last autumn to Business Links, the government's new network of
multi-purpose centres, Whitehall was uncertain about the shape, size and
direction the council should take. Hence the four-month review, and
yesterday's announcement by the DTI.

FT  16 MAR 94 / TV deal proposed on Wimbledon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cable television companies yesterday proposed co-operating with the BBC over
rights to the Wimbledon lawn tennis championships.
The BBC's four-year agreement with the All England Club will end with this
summer's championships. British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite venture
backed by Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has said it will bid
against the BBC.
The cable industry wants to broaden and develop its programming and is
interested in acquiring more exclusive rights to sports events. A consortium
of cable companies recently paid Pounds 7m for exclusive rights to the 1996
World Cricket Cup.
At Wimbledon, cable companies want to televise play on the outer courts
which is rarely covered by the BBC. Cable could thus help the BBC with the
cost of acquiring the rights to televise Wimbledon without detracting from
its own coverage.
'I think it would be a logical development,' Mr Richard Woollam,
director-general of the Cable Television Association, said yesterday. He
agreed, however, that the BBC had rebuffed previous approaches on the issue.
Mr Woollam emphasised that the cable companies had no intention of buying
exclusive sports rights and then handing over short news items about the
events to the conventional broadcasters. He said that the cable industry
wanted to split rights with the terrestrial broadcasters in a way that
increased choice for the audience.
Cable executives believe that buying up sports rights and then depriving the
majority of the audience of coverage could create a political backlash.
The cable industry has so far spent Pounds 1.5bn on developing its networks
and plans to spend an additional Pounds 1.2bn this year.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Police given new cautioning guides
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New guidelines on the cautioning of suspects, which are likely to increase
the number of prosecutions and ultimately the size of the prison population,
were sent to police forces in England and Wales yesterday by Mr Michael
Howard, the home secretary.
The move follows widespread public concern that too many offenders were
escaping prosecution through inappropriate use of cautioning by police.
Mr Howard said that while 87 per cent of cautions were effective, there was
a need to reduce the number of repeat cautions, stop cautions for serious
offences and ensure a more consistent application by police forces.
The guidelines say:
Police should consider whether a caution is likely to be effective and
whether it is appropriate to the offence.
Juveniles should not necessarily be cautioned rather than prosecuted just
because they are young.
Cautions should only be used in exceptional circumstances for serious
offences.
Multiple cautions should only be considered where the subsequent offence is
trivial or where some time has elapsed since the original caution.
Mr Harry Fletcher, general secretary of the National Association of
Probation Officers, said abandoning repeat cautions would result in 60,000
extra prosecutions a year and an increase in the prison population.
In 1992, there were 321,000 cautions for all offences, compared with 279,000
in 1991, and 1,735 cautions for more serious, indictable offences.
The Home Office estimates there will be 50,000 fewer cautions each year but
not all will result in prosecutions.
Police forces piloting so-called Cautioning Plus schemes, in which
conditions such as supervision or community work are attached, are being
asked to monitor the results.
The Police Federation welcomed the guidelines and Mr Howard's recognition
that the decision to issue a caution should always be taken by the police.
Federation chairman Dick Coyles said research showed too many offenders had
received multiple cautions which brought the system into 'disrepute' with
youngsters equating a caution with being 'let off'.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Curb wind farms, says tourist board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Restrictions on wind farms are backed by the Wales Tourist Board today in a
strategy for tourism in the principality.
The board says in its Tourism 2000 strategy document - to be launched today
by Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary: 'The quality of Wales's natural
environment is one of the industry's greatest assets.
'Tourism 2000 recognises the need to conserve and enhance that environment
and is concerned about threats which might impact upon the industry, for
example wind farms.' It endorses the policies of the Countryside Council for
Wales, which opposes wind farms in national parks and other designated
areas.
Wales has eight wind farms, about a third of the UK total, and planning
consent is being sought for many more. But opposition from local authorities
and residents is increasing because of the visual intrusion and noise of the
turbines.
The WTB says the strategy's overall aim 'is to achieve sustainable
development which respects the needs of the environment and is sensitive to
the aspirations of the host community'.
The strategy hopes to create 10,000 jobs in the principality and a growth in
earnings of Pounds 700m in current prices by the year 2000. Tourism employs
about 95,000 people in Wales, or 9 per cent of the workforce, and
contributes Pounds 1.3bn, or 6 per cent, to the principality's gross
domestic product.
Wales is the second most popular destination for UK holidaymakers after the
West Country. But the board acknowledges: 'The image of Wales to potential
new visitors elsewhere in the UK remains somewhat problematical, while in
overseas markets the image is insufficiently strong to get the country on to
the shopping list of possible destinations.'
It says there needs to be effective marketing, improvements in customer
care, more investment to improve visitor satisfaction and cleaner beaches.
There is an urgent need to rationalise promotional activities, 'reducing the
proliferation of tourism literature'.
Next month the board will introduce new grant schemes, including for the
upgrading of hotels and guest houses and for conference facilities.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Corporate cash rise points to recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The liquidity of large UK industrial and commercial companies increased in
the final quarter of last year, confirming the picture of continued
corporate recovery.
Figures yesterday from the Central Statistical Office showed that the
liquidity ratio, which is a ratio of companies' current assets to current
liabilities, rose to 130 per cent at the end of last year, up from from 122
per cent in the third quarter and up from 105 per cent in the fourth quarter
of 1992.
Mr Peter Warburton, chief economist at Robert Fleming, said: 'They confirm
the picture which has been emerging for some time of a corporate sector
happy to accumulate cash.'
He said companies might be reluctant to invest because they were looking for
an unreasonably high rate of return on investment after being over-exposed
to debt in the 1980s. 'At the moment there's no obvious desire by firms to
invest or to acquire, but we may see that soon.'
Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at Morgan Stanley, said: 'These figures show
that the corporate sector is moving further back into cashflow surplus, a
necessary precursor to a revival in capital spending.'
The liquidity ratio of large manufacturers increased to 114 per cent in the
fourth quarter of 1993 from 102 per cent in the third quarter, and the ratio
for large non-manufacturing companies rose to 153 per cent from 151 per
cent.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Construction orders show 30% increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Construction orders won by contractors rose 30 per cent during the three
months to the end of January compared with the corresponding period 12
months earlier.
The figures published yesterday by the Department of the Environment show
that the upsurge in orders since the autumn has continued, providing further
evidence that the recession in the industry may be coming to an end.
The value of orders at constant 1990 prices during the latest three-month
period is the highest since April, May and June in 1989. Orders last year
rose almost 12 per cent to Pounds 22.84bn, adjusted to take account of
seasonal variations. This compared with a peak of Pounds 26.45bn in 1989.
Total orders in January of Pounds 2.17bn were 16 per cent higher than in the
same month in 1993, although Pounds 321m lower than in December.
Contractors say opportunities to tender for work have risen sharply, but
they remain perturbed by the low prices at which jobs are being won. These
leave little or no profit margin unless companies can claim substantial
extra payments to cover design and specification changes.
The department's figures show private-sector housing orders during the
latest three months 12 per cent higher than during the previous three months
and 45 per cent higher than in the corresponding period a year ago.
Infrastructure orders compiled on the same basis were 49 per cent and 46 per
cent higher. Private industrial orders were 30 per cent higher than a year
earlier.

FT  16 MAR 94 / EU scrutineers move into the driving seat: Efforts to
increase competition on the forecourts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday in effect handed to Brussels responsibility for
implementing the Monopolies and Mergers Commission recommendations for
increasing competition in car sales.
In doing so it has acknowledged its failure to make carmakers fall into line
with the MMC's findings and angered consumer groups which claim that car
prices are excessively high in Britain.
It has also irritated the country's 7,000 franchised dealer groups, many of
which maintain that competition is being thwarted by manufacturer
restrictions on dealer activities. But manufacturers are pleased at being
given breathing space while the future structure of car retailing and
distribution in Europe is decided by the European Commission.
Motorists and other interested parties must now wait to see what conclusions
the commission reaches in its review of 'block exemption', the selective
distribution system which allows carmakers to sell vehicles through
exclusive networks.
The system - which requires exemption from EU competition rules - is blamed
by consumer groups for allegedly making UK car prices higher than in many
other parts of Europe. It is also the focus of the MMC's case for increased
competition.
The EU exemption, granted in 1985, runs out on June 30 next year. The motor
industry has already been warned by the EU competition directorate that
renewal will depend largely on manufacturers' adherence to EU limits on car
price differentials across Europe and other signs that consumers are not
being disadvantaged.
It is the hope of the UK government that the MMC's concerns will be
adequately addressed by the European Commission. The MMC report on car
distribution and sales, published almost two years ago, found that a complex
monopoly existed in favour of 24 car suppliers.
It identified a number of restrictions imposed by suppliers in agreements
with dealers as operating against the public interest. It also found that a
scale monopoly existed in favour of Ford, but did not find that this
operated against the public interest.
The MMC recommended the removal of a number of restrictions on franchised
dealers imposed by some, but not all, of the leading manufacturers. It cited
those which:
Limit dealers' freedom to advertise outside their territory.
Limit dealers' freedom to hold or acquire dealerships from other car makers
outside their territory.
Prevent dealers holding or acquiring competing dealerships in their
territory.
Restrict the extent to which dealers can sell car-related goods or services,
such as hire, second-hand car sales, fast-fit or multi-brand servicing
outside their territory.
Limit the number of the manufacturer's cars that any dealer or dealer group
may sell in any given period, or the proportion of the total sales of its
cars that may be made by any dealer or dealer group.
Ford and other makers have dug in their heels against the recommendations.
Consumer groups have been consistently critical of manufacturers and
dealers, claiming that mediocre service and repair performance undermines
the concept on which block exemption had been based.
They also want a market free-for-all, with manufacturers obliged to supply
cars to virtually any outlet.
Car prices have been moving closer in line across Europe, partly due to the
recession, partly through currency shifts and as a result of EU warnings
about the conditions under which block exemption might be renewed.
The government, has found the the vehicle distribution and retailing issue
more complex than at first appeared and has concluded that to seek to impose
its will now, with only 15 months to go before the block exemption expires,
would muddy the waters unnecessarily around the European Commission's own
deliberations.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Mail order boosts retail sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Large supermarkets and mail order companies were the principal beneficiaries
of February's growth in retail sales, the Confederation of British Industry
said yesterday.
Its distributive trades survey showed that retailers with only one shop
reported a small annual decline in volumes. The survey reports the views of
companies as a balance of those reporting favourable conditions against
those reporting unfavourable conditions. It also compiles a balance of
expectations of conditions three months ahead.
Growth was particularly strong for mail order companies. A balance of 70 per
cent reported that sales were up on a year ago, compared with a balance of 4
per cent in January. Apart from mail order companies, shops of all sizes
reported that sales were well below normal for the time of year.
Motor traders continued to do particularly well. Their sales increased at
the strongest rate since August 1988, with the exception of January. As
stocks have been run down, orders placed with suppliers grew at their
fastest rate for over five years. But in line with the rapid sales growth,
prices increased more markedly than at any time since May 1991.
On the retail side, the survey indicated that sales were still well up on a
year before for grocers including supermarkets. But butchers, bakers and
greengrocers reported a drop in volumes compared with a year before.
Sales of furniture, carpets, clothing, hardware and DIY goods grew
moderately compared with a year before, while chemists reported their first
year-on-year fall in sales since March last year.
The survey, conducted between February 15 and March 2, covered 15,000
outlets including wholesalers, retailers and motor traders. It showed that
wholesalers' sales volumes increased in the year to February at the highest
rate since last October. Orders placed with suppliers also rose on an annual
basis in February, but at the slowest rate for six months.
On the jobs front, the survey showed that the trend towards part-time
employment in retailing continues, with these jobs being created at the
fastest rate for over three years. Full-time employment, meanwhile,
continues to fall. Business optimism about the next three months was up in
February for the fifth successive survey. But the increase was the smallest
for a year.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Life insurer refuses to answer MPs' question
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A direct clash between a Commons committee and a leading life insurance
company loomed yesterday after Lloyds Abbey Life refused to respond to a
question from the social security committee.
Mr Frank Field, Labour chairman of the committee, has written to Sir Simon
Hornby, Lloyds Abbey Life chairman, urging him to repair the damage done by
the response from Mr Alan Frost, Abbey Life managing director.
Abbey Life was one of the six largest providers of personal pensions to
which the committee wrote last week, asking if they took part in a survey by
accountancy firm KPMG Peat Marwick of mis-selling personal pensions to
people transferring out of employers' schemes.
The study, published in December, sparked widespread public concern when it
failed to find any evidence that sales agents had met regulators'
requirements in nine out of 10 pension transfer cases.
Mr Frost's reply to Mr Field said he recognised the committee's wish to draw
its own conclusions, but he believed that responses from individual
companies might not necessarily lead to the correct conclusions.
He expressed the view that the Securities and Investments Board, the City's
chief watchdog which commissioned the survey, should provide the committee
with all the details.
Mr Field's letter to Sir Simon came after he had discussed the issue with Mr
Peter Thurnham, the leader of the Conservative MPs on the committee. The
matter is to be raised at the committee's meeting today.
Commons select committees have wide-ranging powers to call for persons,
papers and records. As well as featuring in the social security committee's
work on aspects of personal and state pensions, the issue of pension
transfers has arisen in the Treasury committee's financial regulation
inquiry.
Mr Field said yesterday other life insurance companies to which the
committee had written had replied, though their responses had not yet been
circulated. The committee could demand that the SIB reveal which companies
had taken part in the survey, he said, but it was reluctant to do this
because the SIB had acquired the information on the basis that it would not
reveal it.
Regulators have emphasised that the findings of the KPMG study were
representative of the industry as a whole, but companies have been unwilling
to reveal their participation in the survey.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Radio licence set to go to dark-horse bidder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A dark-horse bidder backed by US and Australian broadcasting groups
yesterday emerged as the most likely winner of the UK's third national
commercial radio licence with a bid more than Pounds 1m larger than its
nearest rival.
Talk Radio UK, which plans to offer 24 hour a day phone-ins, debate and
conversation, bid Pounds 3.82m a year - the highest of six bids. In second
place was Newstalk UK, a consortium led by Associated Newspapers, publisher
of the Daily Mail, which bid Pounds 2.756m.
Newstalk UK, with a news and information format, may still have an outside
chance depending on the view the Radio Authority takes of Talk Radio's
business plan. The authority will be examining the company's bid in detail
before awarding the licence in June or July.
London Broadcasting Company, the news and talk company which has lost its
two London licences, also lost a lifeline yesterday - it was fourth with a
bid of Pounds 2.007m. LBC will now go off the air in the first week of
October after more than 20 years of broadcasting to London.
Talk Radio UK is a consortium put together by Media Ventures International,
a London-based media investment fund. The bid is backed by Emmis
Broadcasting - which owns and operates radio stations in Los Angeles, New
York and Chicago - and Prime Television, a company with broadcasting
interests in Australia.
The Pounds 3.8m bid - plus 4 per cent of advertising revenue which goes to
the Treasury and an annual Pounds 400,000 licence fee to the authority
before transmitter or any other costs - looks high for a talk station. The
authority will now be looking carefully to see whether the service can be
sustained over the eight years of the licence with such costs.
When awarding the national pop music licence the authority rejected the
highest bid, Pounds 4.01m from National Broadcasting Company, and gave the
licence to the second-highest bidder, Virgin 1215, which bid Pounds 1.883m.
Mr Christopher Turner, a director of Media Ventures, denied last night that
the Talk Radio consortium had bid too high.
'It depends on your cost base,' he said. The company would not set up
expensive news operations but would use basic news headlines to stimulate
debate and controversy. In the US, he said, the chat format was among the
most successful.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Muddle over rail privatisation forces special bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has been forced to draw up a special bill to correct a rail
privatisation muddle which accidentally reduced the powers of the British
Transport Police.
The decision follows claims by the Transport Police Federation that an error
in the Railway Privatisation Act could leave railway police virtually
powerless in an emergency.
The error arose because the act defined the powers of the transport police
on the basis of the 1949 act, which nationalised the railways.
The clause dealing with police powers ignored several amendments to the 1949
act that significantly widened the powers of the 2,200 transport police
officers. In effect, the new act allows transport police to deal with
incidents affecting privatised railway companies, but prevents them carrying
out further inquiries.
Transport police officers say the act also makes it unclear whether they
would have the authority to pursue offenders outside railway property.
The government intended to correct the error during the later stages of the
privatisation bill, but ran out of time.
Ministers then hoped to use the police and magistrates courts bill or the
criminal justice bill to amend the privatisation act.
However, ministers have been forced to accept that neither bill will become
law before April 1, when British Rail's track and infrastructure will pass
into the ownership of Railtrack.
Earl Ferrers, the Home Office minister of state, said the government would
table a special one-clause bill to take effect later this month.
Mr Mike Bevan, the federation's chairman, said transport ministers were
warned about the error several times before the act became law in November.
Opposition MPs said the muddle reflected the government's determination to
force the bill through without sufficient debate. 'This is a classic example
of ministerial arrogance at its worst,' said Mr Andrew MacKinlay, Labour MP
for Thurrock.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Customs won over by baggy fashions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trends in teenage fashion finally reached senior officials at the Customs &amp;
Excise Department, who have agreed to stop children's baggy clothing falling
into the value added tax net.
In sombre statement yesterday, the department announced it would issue a
revised schedule of maximum measurements of clothing and footwear eligible
for relief.
The effect will be to waive VAT on sales of baggy trousers and sweatshirts
in sizes designed for children aged up to 14.
The move followed 18 months of discussion with clothing manufacturers, which
claimed that the latest styles of baggier clothing were being unfairly
excluded from the VAT relief applicable to children's clothes. 'This
reflects the fact that fashions change and children are getting bigger,'
said Ms Liz Fox, assistant director of the British Clothing Industry
Association.
Customs officials had raised worries about whether adults would be able to
squeeze into the clothes and wear them skin-tight. They have now got around
the problem by permitting extra large chest and waist measurements, but more
child-length sleeve and inside leg sizes.
'Grown-ups aren't going to get away with it,' a Customs official said
yesterday, adding that girls' shoes between sizes 1 1/2 and 5 1/2 would have
relief from VAT provided they were not fashion shoes.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Defence chief's successor named
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Sir Peter Inge yesterday became chief of the Defence Staff in
succession to Sir Peter Harding, who resigned after newspaper allegations of
adultery.
Sir Peter, a 58-year-old Sandhurst officer who became chief of the General
Staff two years ago after service in a number of countries, had been acting
as caretaker military adviser to the government until Mr Malcolm Rifkind,
defence secretary, confirmed him as Britain's top military officer.
High among the new defence chief's priorities will be to restore morale in
the armed services at a time of almost continuous upheaval.
The resignation of his combative but popular pre-decessor - whose political
skills made him a formidable spokesman for the military in a
Treasury-dominated Whitehall - came at a time of sharp defence cuts and
fierce debate over deployment of fresh UK troops in Bosnia. Study teams are
seeking savings of Pounds 2.3bn in support operations across the military
and the MoD.
The Ministry of Defence yesterday confirmed that it was conducting an
enquiry into the 'possible implications' of the 'security angles' of Sir
Peter Harding's alleged affair with the former wife of the ex-MP Sir Anthony
Buck.
Sir Peter, 60, quit immediately details of his affair with Bienvenida
Sokolow, the divorced wife of former Tory MP Sir Antony Buck, appeared in
the News of the World.
Sir Peter Inge, who becomes a field marshal, has in turn been succeeded by
General Sir Charles Guthrie, 55, who was until yesterday commander of
British Forces in Germany.
Sir Peter's appointment to the Pounds 112,083-a-year post was warmly
welcomed by the opposition. Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary said:
'I have known Sir Peter for some time and have a high regard for his
abilities.'
Mr Menzies Campbell, Liberal Democrat defence spokesman, said: 'At a very
difficult time in defence policy there could not be a better appointment
than that of Sir Peter Inge. He will bring to the job a very considerable
experience allied to an intimate knowledge of the working of Whitehall.'

FT  16 MAR 94 / Treasury urged to act on Tube funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior members of the panel set up to promote private finance in
public-sector projects yesterday urged the Treasury to end a funding logjam
for the London Under-ground.
A large number of the members of the government's private finance panel
recommended that ministers should put a deal to lease new trains for the
Northern Line out to competitive tender. They believe the issue could become
a test case for the panel.
ABB Transportation, the Derby-based manufacturer of rolling stock, has
offered to build, maintain and operate about 100 new trains for Pounds 440m
under a 20-year licensing deal.
Some members of the panel want the Treasury to accept the deal if no better
offer comes out of the competitive tendering process.
The Treasury has rejected the ABB offer because its guidelines state that
there is little attraction in leasing if it represents a deferred purchase
because this could normally be financed more cheaply by the government.
Treasury ministers also believe that ABB's payment for supplying the trains
should be directly linked to traffic on the Northern Line.
But panel members have questioned how the operating risk can be transferred
to a supplier which has no control over the Northern line's operation.
One member said: 'If the private finance panel cannot persuade the Treasury
to see a way through this problem there is little point in our existence.'
Although the panel was careful not to make a public recommendation, the
lobbying by senior members to break the impasse was yesterday welcomed by
many Conservative MPs representing London constituencies.
A number of them yesterday added their voices to calls for renewed
investment for the Northern Line.
Mr John Marshall (Hendon South) said the government should take advantage of
the offer from ABB.
ABB's proposals would meet almost half of the Pounds 1bn costs of
modernising rolling stock, signals and track. The newest rolling stock on
the line is 34 years old.
The Department of Transport is strongly in favour of the proposals.
London First, the business consortium which seeks to promote the capital, is
seeking to gain support for the ABB deal from leading business-men.
Some members of the private finance panel also want the Treasury to think
again about a Pounds 4m deal to lease automatic access gates for 12 of its
busiest stations.
It was the second time in a month that a London Underground proposal to
bring in private finance to pay for investments had met Treasury objections.

<TEXT>
Air bubbles have become the latest weapon in the battle to contain small oil
spills from tankers, Robert Corzine writes. Shell has installed a
bubble-based containment system - shown in use above - at its Stanlow
manufacturing centre at Ellesmere Port in Cheshire. A wall of bubbles
released from hundreds of small holes in hoses anchored to the bottom of the
Manchester Ship Canal is strong enough to confine minor spills of oil or
chemicals, giving crews time to activate more substantial containment
systems, such as inflatable booms. The system was tested by the Royal Navy
at Plymouth

FT  16 MAR 94 / Carsberg rebuffs credit card industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, is to hold a public
hearing in September on whether there should be a change in the law on
credit card issuers.
At present, where goods or services paid for by a credit card are not
delivered or are misrepresented, issuers are liable for transactions.
The removal of credit providers' joint and several liability was one of the
recommendations from the de-regulation task forces set up by the Department
of Trade and Industry.
While the Credit Card Research Group, financed by the credit card industry,
welcomed the public hearing, Sir Bryan rejected the card issuers' argument
that the law was unclear and emphasised that card issuers would be breaking
their obligations under the consumer credit act if they refused to meet
legitimate claims.
He also signalled that he was far from convinced of the need for change. 'I
should certainly find it difficult to recommend a change in the law towards
a 'second-in-line' approach without clear agreement by all card issuers as
to the extent, particularly for overseas transactions, beyond which it would
not be reasonably practicable for consumers to go in pursuit of a defaulting
supplier before they could seek redress from a card issuer standing
'second-in-line'.'
The research group argued that the law gave less protection to people buying
goods using cheques or cash than to those using credit cards.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Major says IRA cannot bomb its way to talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The IRA cannot bomb its way to the negotiating table, Mr John Major told MPs
yesterday, as the government stepped up efforts in a series of
behind-closed-doors meetings to co-ordinate a convincing response to the
latest wave of terrorist attacks.
A 50-minute meeting yesterday morning between the prime minister and Mr
James Molyneaux focused on the political talks process and security, with
the Ulster Unionist party leader calling for pressure to be put on Dublin to
crack down on terrorism.
This was followed immediately by a secret session of the cabinet
subcommittee on terrorism, chaired by Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, and
containing seven of his cabinet colleagues.
The prime minister is understood to have held a second short meeting with Mr
Molyneaux yesterday afternoon.
The UUP leader later released a toughly worded statement describing Dublin's
'updated' arrangements for dealing with terrorists as 'seriously flawed' and
the lack of results as 'quite scandalous'.
He dealt a blow to the government's hopes of pressing ahead with the
three-stranded political talks process, saying that institutionalised
structures for dealing with north-south relations - such as those advocated
by nationalists - would not serve any practical purpose and 'merely create
suspicion'.
Pressure for the government to ensure that a tougher line is taken against
terrorism will increase tomorrow when the Tory backbench Northern Ireland
committee meets.
Meanwhile, Downing Street hinted that moves might be put in train to stage
another meeting between the prime minister and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish
counterpart, before their next scheduled get-together in June. One informed
source said he was certain the two men would meet before June.
It was announced yesterday that in April Mr Molyneaux will lead a
four-strong delegation to the US to meet senior politicians and White House

FT  16 MAR 94 / Cabinet ministers meet for secret talks on Ulster terror
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A high-level committee of cabinet ministers met secretly at Westminster
yesterday as the government stepped up its efforts to co-ordinate a
convincing response to the latest wave of terrorist attacks.
Amid mounting pressure from unionists and Conservative backbenchers for a
security clampdown, powerful voices on the body - the ministerial
sub-committee on terrorism - are thought to have advised against radical new
counter-terrorist measures. They are understood to have argued instead that
talks with Dublin aimed at improving co-operation should be pursued with
increased vigour.
The committee of eight cabinet ministers, chaired by Mr Michael Howard, the
home secretary, is charged with keeping arrangements for countering
terrorism under review and dealing with terrorist incidents and their
consequences.
Mr John Major told MPs that the IRA could not bomb its way to the
negotiating table, while Downing Street hinted that moves might be put in
train to stage another meeting between the prime minister and Mr Albert
Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, before their next scheduled get-together in
June.
As a bomb planted close to Sevenoaks railway station in Kent was made safe,
the prime minister held what Downing Street described as 'an extremely
friendly and constructive' meeting on the political talks process and the
security situation with Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionists.
Mr Molyneaux later issued a tough statement describing Dublin's 'updated'
arrangements for dealing with terrorists as 'seriously flawed' and the lack
of results as 'quite scandalous'.
He dealt a blow to the government's hopes of pressing ahead with the
three-stranded talks process, saying that institutionalised structures for
dealing with north-south relations - such as those advocated by nationalists
 -would not serve any practical purpose and 'merely create suspicion'.
The two men are understood to have held a second short meeting in the
Commons yesterday afternoon.
Pressure for the government to ensure that a tougher line is taken against
terrorism north and south of the border will increase tomorrow when the Tory
backbench Northern Ireland committee meets.
At prime minister's questions the Tory MP Mr Terry Dicks, whose constituency
covers part of Heathrow airport, raised the issue of the three mortar
attacks and demanded a 'shoot-to-kill policy in Northern Ireland to enable
the security forces to eliminate all IRA terrorists'.
Separately, it was announced yesterday that Mr Molyneaux will next month
lead a four-man delegation to the US to meet senior politicians. The visit
follows criticism of the unionists for not stating their case in the US at
the same time as Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president.
Mr Peter Robinson, the hardline Democratic Unionist MP, called for 'urgent
efforts' to set up a united unionist front against the Downing Street
declaration.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Amendment to police bill agreed by Lords
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The House of Lords yesterday reluctantly approved complex provisions which
put into effect a government climbdown over the appointment of police
authorities, Ivor Owen writes.
They were described as an 'elaborate farce' by Lord Callaghan, former Labour
prime minister, who forecast they would be swept away when parliament next
dealt with legislation on the police.
Tory backbench peers, whose original condemnation of the powers sought by Mr
Michael Howard, home secretary, forced his retreat, criticised the
complexity of amendments.
Earl Ferrers, Home Office minister, said the 'complicated arrangement' to be
inserted into the police and magistrates' courts bill would ensure that
members of police authorities would be 'truly independent'.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Fishermen want seal culling resumed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fishermen want seal culling to be renewed to cut down the growing numbers of
seals which they say are threatening their livelihoods by damaging fish
stocks and equipment, James Buxton writes.
A group from the Scottish Fishermens' Federation, including representatives
of English and Irish fishermen's organisations, will tell Scottish Natural
Heritage, the environmental agency for Scotland, that since culling was
banned in 1978 it estimates the number of grey seals around the UK coast has
risen from 70,000 to between 100,000 and 110,000. About 90,000 are thought
to be in Scottish waters.
Mr Roddy McColl, chairman of the group, says it has scientific evidence
suggesting that seals are eating up to 240,000 tonnes of fish a year. This
means that 'seals have a substantial EU quota to themselves'.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Unions protest at injury cash curb
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A group of unions has threatened legal action against Mr Michael Howard, the
home secretary, over plans to reform the criminal injuries compensation
system and replace individual assessments with a fixed tariff from April 1.
Unions representing nurses, firefighters, train drivers, teachers, local
authority workers and bank staff are concerned that the new scheme will
leave members worse off when they are seriously injured at work by criminal
assault.
Backed by the TUC, they claim that the home secretary is in breach of his
duty under the 1988 Criminal Justice Act in abolishing the criminal injuries
compensation board by parliamentary order, rather than by primary
legislation.
In a letter to Mr Howard, Mr Andrew Dismore of solicitors Robin Thompson and
Partners says the unions 'will have no option but to take appropriate legal
proceedings' unless the proposed scheme is withdrawn.
Legal action would take the form of an application to the courts for a
judge's order requiring the home secretary to cancel his plan.
'The unions have been forced to take the government to court as a last
resort to defend the interests of ordinary working people who are the
victims of violent crime during their employment,' said Mr Dismore
yesterday.
The unions concerned are the Fire Brigades union, the NASUWT teachers'
union, the Royal College of Nursing, Aslef, the train drivers' union, the
NatWest staff association and the general unions Unison, GMB and TGWU.
'My clients are deeply distressed that their members should be the victims
of a costcutting exercise by the government,' Mr Dismore says in his letter
to Mr Howard. 'Moreover I have advised my clients that the new scheme has
been introduced unconstitutionally and unlawfully.'

FT  16 MAR 94 / Ship repairer set to buy Cammell Laird yard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cammell Laird, the Merseyside military shipyard which closed last year, is
within weeks of being sold to a ship repair company which plans to employ
1,600 people there by the end of next year.
VSEL, the Barrow-based nuclear submarine builder which owns the Birkenhead
yard, yesterday confirmed that a March 31 deadline had been imposed for
completion.
The bidder is Coastline Industries, which already leases Cammell Laird's dry
docks and other facilities and has taken on about 600 workers in the past
year to fulfil contracts with several shipping lines and owners.
Coastline was founded five years ago by Mr John Stafford, a former Grant
Thornton accountant, to exploit ship repairing opportunities which could
emerge from the upturn of trade at the port of Liverpool and intensification
of Irish Sea trade.
The deal was negotiated in January by Mr Amin Amiri, corporate finance
partner of Grant Thornton in Liverpool, but completion has been bogged down
by legal arguments over site values and long-term environmental liabilities.
These are understood to have forced VSEL to lower its price while confining
future use of the site to shipbuilding and ship repair.
VSEL has imposed the March 31 deadline to force sale or withdrawal. Mr
Norman Broadhurst, VSEL finance director, said: 'There are other
shipbuilding companies now interested. We gave Coastline exclusivity, but it
is now up to them to complete.'
Rival bids for Cammell Laird are understood to depend on the European
Commission allowing intervention funding. Mr Frank Field, Labour MP for
Birkenhead, and Mr Barry Porter, Conservative MP for neighbouring Wirral
South, discussed this in Brussels yesterday. However, VSEL has been
consistently refused EU help for Cammell Laird because it made warships -
intervention funding has so far been limited to civil yards facing closure.
Mr Jonathan Diggines, director of the Manchester office of Murray Johnstone,
the Glasgow-based fund manager, yesterday confirmed it would be underwriting
the deal. The price is not being disclosed, but about Pounds 10m is
understood to be available. Allied Irish Banks is providing loan and working
capital for Coastline's expansion.
Coastline has brought in Mr Alan Greenough, a deal-making specialist, in an
attempt to push the sale through.
If the deal is completed, Coastline will take over Cammell Laird's
all-weather construction hall, three dry docks and its wet basin. Some of
the facilities may be leased later.
Aluminium Shipbuilders, which specialises in large catamarans, has looked at
the construction hall as a site for building third-generation Seacat
ferries.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Howard changes cautioning guide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New guidelines on the cautioning of suspects, which are likely to increase
the number of prosecutions and ultimately the size of the prison population,
were sent to police forces in England and Wales yesterday by Mr Michael
Howard, the home secretary.
The move follows widespread public concern that too many offenders were
escaping prosecution through inappropriate use of cautioning by police.
Mr Howard said that while 87 per cent of cautions were effective, there was
a need to reduce the number of repeat cautions, stop cautions for serious
offences and ensure a more consistent application by police forces.
The guidelines say:
Police should consider whether a caution is likely to be effective and
whether it is appropriate to the offence.
Juveniles should not necessarily be cautioned rather than prosecuted just
because they are young.
Cautions should only be used in exceptional circumstances for serious
offences.
Multiple cautions should only be considered where the subsequent offence is
trivial or where some time has elapsed since the original caution.
Mr Harry Fletcher, general secretary of the National Association of
Probation Officers, said abandoning repeat cautions would result in 60,000
extra prosecutions a year and an increase in the prison population.
In 1992, there were 321,000 cautions for all offences, compared with 279,000
in 1991, and 1,735 cautions for more serious, indictable offences.
The Home Office estimates there will be 50,000 fewer cautions each year but
not all of these cases will result in prosecutions.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Cut feared in plans for road building
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Civil engineering and building materials companies are increasingly worried
that higher-than-expected construction costs will persuade the government to
make substantial cuts in the road-building programme, Andrew Taylor writes.
Ministers are expected to announce reductions in construction plans after a
review of the 10-year national road programme, which is worth Pounds 23bn.
Contractors fear cuts may be deeper than expected because of rising costs.
Many contracts won at low prices during the recession have turned out to be
much more expensive, with costs up to 40 per cent higher than the tender
price according to some contractors. Claims for additional payments to cover
changes in specification or unexpected ground conditions have allowed
contractors to recover some of the margin they may have lost by bidding a
low price.
Tender prices for new work have also stopped falling and may even have risen
slightly.
In the Budget Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, had indicated that lower
construction prices caused by the recession would protect building plans.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Gummer aims to reduce car use
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Local authorities in England will be encouraged to take planning decisions
that limit the scale of out-of-town developments and reduce reliance on
private cars under guidance issued yesterday.
Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, announced planning guidelines
intended to reduce the growth of car and commercial vehicle journeys and to
increase the scope for use of public transport.
The planning guidance note represents the most detailed statement on
transport policy since the government committed itself to an environmental
strategy at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit.
Three main aims of the new planning policy are:
To ensure that new developments which necessitate journeys are built where
there is a choice of transport. Shops, offices, cinemas and leisure centres
should be close together so one journey can serve several purposes.
To provide housing developments with public transport links and nearby local
services so that journeys can be made on foot or bicycle.
To improve the quality of life in towns and cities - which are efficient
transport locations - while maintaining the vitality of the countryside, in
order to reduce the need for long-distance commuting.
Consistent policies to reduce the need to travel could result in a 15 per
cent reduction in fuel consumption and exhaust emissions over 20 years, Mr
Gummer said.
The impact of the new policies will be gradual because only 1 per cent to 2
per cent of the country's stock of buildings is renewed each year. But over
time the new policy, combined with the government's plan to raise fuel duty
by at least 5 per cent a year, will make a difference.
The government is keen to prevent the spread of out-of-town superstores
which can be reached only by car. Sainsbury, the food retailer with many
out-of-town superstores, said it was studying the detail of the government's
plans, adding that food shopping accounted for only 2.5 per cent of total
household car mileage.
Friends of the Earth said traffic growth would not be cut while transport
secretary Mr John MacGregor's 'motorway mania is allowed to continue'. His
department is soon to announce a review of its Pounds 23bn road-building
programme.
The Council for the Protection of Rural England called for a shift in
government spending from roads to public transport. 'We still don't see
evidence of rural communities being given a viable choice of public
transport,' it said.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Paramount may trigger payout delays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Insolvency practitioners yesterday warned that payments to creditors of
companies in receivership and administration could be substantially delayed
as a result of the Court of Appeal's ruling on Paramount Airways.
The concern came in spite of the government's decision on Monday to
introduce emergency insolvency legislation in the next two weeks to reduce
employment obligations in the future.
In a Commons statement, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary,
said new legislation would provide that only the limited costs of wages,
salaries and pension contributions of staff would rank as secured creditors
to companies in receivership or administration.
His comments came in response to lobbying by the insolvency profession after
the court's ruling earlier this month suggested that administrators were
deemed to have adopted the contractual employment obligations of the company
after 14 days.
Practitioners said yesterday they were waiting to study the small print in
the draft legislation, expected over the next few days, and had concerns
about residual obligations.
Some argued that it would have been better had Mr Heseltine proposed that
receivers and administrators would not be deemed to have adopted the
contracts of employment of staff in companies if they issued no new
contracts within 14 days of their appointment.
The statement will have no effect on additional contractual employment
claims which may be triggered on companies entering administration or
receivership before this week.
Mr John Alexander, an insolvency partner with Pannell Kerr Forster, said he
was likely to ask for indemnities to any banks before authorising further
payments, so that he could reclaim the money if necessary.
Mr Mark Homan, president of the Society of Practitioners of Insolvency, said
it would take 'many months' to quantify potential additional employment
costs.
Additional employment claims could be triggered in many cases, including
Swan Hunter, Leyland Daf and Ferranti, although they are less likely where
the company has been bought as a going concern and the obligations taken on
by the purchaser.
The Paramount creditors' committee, which met on Monday, has until Friday to
decide whether to take the Court of Appeal's ruling to the House of Lords.
It has agreed provisionally to proceed, but needs to prepare a legal case
and raise at least Pounds 100,000 from the insolvency profession to cover
the costs.
Other insolvency practitioners are considering whether other cases might be
taken through the courts and interpreted more favourably.
Meanwhile, Michael Mayes, the Rotherham-based textile company which was
highlighted as the first large business to be affected by the Paramount
ruling, was preparing yesterday to lay off all but 15 of its 140 staff. The
receiver has given the management until Monday to prepare a buy-out offer.
It will have to raise tens of thousands of pounds for the purchase, and meet
a large additional working capital requirement.
The employment obligations are believed to exceed the value of the company's
assets. There was no sign last night of an external buyer.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Lords reluctantly approve amendment to police bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The House of Lords yesterday reluctantly approved complex provisions which
put into effect a government climbdown over the appointment of police
authorities.
They were described as an 'elaborate farce' by Lord Callaghan, former Labour
prime minister, who forecast they would be swept away when parliament next
dealt with legislation on the police.
Tory backbench peers, whose condemnation of the powers originally sought by
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, forced his retreat, also criticised
the length and complexity of the amendments.
Earl Ferrers, Home Office minister, said the 'complicated arrangement' which
peers had been asked to insert into the police and magistrates' courts bill
would ensure that members of police authorities would be 'wholly and truly
independent'. Membership would normally include nine councillors and three
magistrates, and five independent members co-opted from 10 names provided by
the home secretary. Earl Ferrers said he would now choose the 10 from a
shortlist of 20 provided by a local selection panel.
Lord McIntosh of Haringey, chief Labour speaker in the debate, urged peers
to accept the new provisions in the interests of reaching an agreement which
would not be overturned in the Commons.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Best-selling trust to suffer yield cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A group offering a 10 per cent return on its best-selling trust has warned
70,000 investors that it will cut the yield to 9 per cent from June 28.
The high-income unit trust offered by fund manager Foreign &amp; Colonial has
pulled in more than Pounds 500m since its launch just over a year ago.
It was particularly attractive to income seekers and heavily promoted by
many financial intermediaries because of the 10 per cent yield.
Such funds, which obtain an unusually high income, have been highly
controversial because they can procure such high returns only at the expense
of the capital growth prospects.
Many experts believe savers' capital could actually be eroded in order to
keep the income flowing.
Over the past year, anyone investing in the F&amp;C fund would have lost roughly
10 per cent of their initial investment - neatly cancelling out the benefit
of the 10 per cent income. Most conventional equity income funds have
produced a significantly better return.
Mr Simon James, F&amp;C director, said the decision to cut the target yield on
the fund was mainly because the group expects interest rates to move lower
this year. He added that the group also wants to give investors plenty of
notice of the impending cut in yield.
F&amp;C has also trimmed its management charge from 1.5 per cent to 1.25 per
cent with effect from April 6.

FT  16 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Beijing and the business of human rights -
US company fears of losing their fastest growing market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, confronted Chinese
officials in Beijing at the weekend on the vexed issue of human rights and
trading rights, it was the American who blinked first.
Since last June the administration of President Bill Clinton has vowed to
annul China's Most Favoured Nation trade status unless it improved its human
rights record. However, in spite of compromising noises made by Mr
Christopher as he left Beijing on Monday, China has not only failed to make
any 'significant' progress to which the secretary of state could point, it
has yet even to offer political cover for what appears to be a US retreat.
China has had dangled before it the possibility of permanent MFN status but
has remained insistent that the human rights of its citizens is its own
business. Its officials are of the view that the US needs China as much as
China needs the US. They might be right.
US companies have committed or invested Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.8bn) in
China. It is their fastest growing export market, according to Ms Pam
Baldinger, communications director of the Business Coalition for US-China
trade. The group of 1,000 companies warns that loss of China's MFN status,
and subsequent reprisals, would put all the investment at risk.
American exports to China soared by 19 per cent in 1992 and 17 per cent last
year. Most of the market is in sophisticated technology, capital equipment
and aerospace, industries which provide the high wage jobs Mr Clinton has
promised to increase.
More than anything, it is China's potential that draws hungry companies in
droves. According to the Business Coalition, the potential market looks like
this: Dollars 40bn over the next 20 years for aerospace; Dollars 90bn over
the next seven years for power generation equipment; Dollars 29bn over five
years for telecommunications; Dollars 18.2bn over three years for oilfield
and gas machinery and Dollars 4.3bn over the next eight years for computers.
Withdrawal of MFN would make a gift of these markets to European and
Japanese competitors. It would also cost US consumers an estimated Dollars
16bn they save buying cheap Chinese goods.
'Loss of MFN would poison the trade environment,' said Mr Bill Lane of
Caterpillar, which had a 20 per cent surge in sales of construction and
mining equipment to China last year. With Japanese suppliers still in the
lead, 'it's critical that MFN be renewed', he said.
American Telephone and Telegraph has been making deep inroads in China. Mr
Randolph Lumb, government relations vice president for AT&amp;T, said the
company can generate Dollars 6-Dollars 8 through trade with its China
subsidiaries for every Dollars 1 invested there.
In Guangdong province, the company has beaten formidable competition from
entrenched companies such as Alcatel, the French telecoms equipment maker,
and Ericsson, the Swedish group, to win big switching and transmission
contracts. Its joint venture in Shanghai is the leading supplier of telecom
transmission equipment in the country.
Sales of switching and transmission systems are rising. AT&amp;T Network Systems
has fibre optic and transmission joint ventures in China with switching and
microelectronic ventures under negotiation. AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories is
working with the Chinese government to set up a research and development
operation in the country.
China also offers hope for the US commercial aircraft sector, which has been
hit hard by competition from the European Airbus consortium and by recession
abroad. McDonnell Douglas has been in China since 1975 selling aircraft and
producing components.
'It took 10 years to get that project off the ground,' said Mr Mark
Schlansky, a McDonnell Douglas spokesman. 'It required a great deal of
patience. Trust had to be built on both sides. Progress had to be
incremental. Now we've learned their values, and they've learned ours.'
One sector - textiles and apparel - projects gains if China was to lose its
MFN status. The American Textiles Manufacturers Institute says China has
become the largest foreign US textile supplier, but higher tariffs would cut
into its exports. It was unlikely that China's quota share would be
redistributed, the association said. The gain would be for US companies.
Most exporters anonymously fault the Clinton administration for taking
seriously the president's rhetoric on China during his election campaign.
Like Mr Cal Cohen of the Emergency Committee for American Trade, they argue
that the development of China's market economy promotes human rights more
than any other measure.
Companies complain that the administration has sent mixed signals. The
commerce department put China on top of its Big Emerging Markets list, a
strategy for pushing exports in 10 regions outside the European Union and
Japan. At the same time the president and the state department were issuing
threats.
Exporters are weary of the annual MFN renewal exercise. They hope that,
given any reasonable progress, the administration will give China a multiple
year renewal or look elsewhere for a less ruinous issue with which to put
presure on Beijing.
On Capitol Hill, where the Democrats used to assail President George Bush
regularly for not promoting human rights, sentiment has begun to shift
towards renewing MFN. 'There are too many jobs at stake,' said a long-time
congressional aide. 'The momentum now has gone the other way.'

FT  16 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Brussels set for retreat on textiles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission is preparing for a climbdown on the harsh textile
import restrictions from China it imposed on Monday.
A meeting of the textiles committee today is likely to review both the
administration and the size of the new quotas just a few days after they
came into force - an acknowledgement that the EU substantially misjudged the
size of trade flows and the number of companies doing business with China.
Most textiles products from China, which is not a member of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, are covered by bilateral deals under the
Multi Fibre Arrangement, which controls around 70 per cent of trade in the
sector. But some products, like silk shirts, are not covered by the MFA but
are controlled under the 'autonomous regime' of national quotas.
Last Friday evening, Brussels announced the size of the new EU-wide quota
that was to replace national quotas, under single market rules, from this
Monday onwards.
Textiles companies had only the weekend to apply for import licences and
come to terms with the new quota system, which is vastly oversubscribed.
An official from the UK Trade and Industry Department said it had dealt with
and passed on 1,300 applications for quota from UK companies over the
weekend - theoretically to be allocated on a first-come-first-served basis.
Silk City, which manufacturers silk shirts in China for export to the EU,
said it alone could fill the EU quota of 5,000 tonnes for silk shirts.
In Brussels, a member of the textiles committee acknowledged that the
administration of the quotas was flawed and that 'past performance' was
likely to become the criterion upon which quotas were allocated.

GEC-Alsthom said yesterday it had resolved a dispute among its South Korean
subcontractors that threatened to derail a Dollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.6bn)
contract to supply the train a grande vitesse (TGV) for the country's new
high-speed rail system.
The row erupted last November when GEC-Alsthom selected Hyundai Precision
and Industry instead of Daewoo Heavy Industries to head a consortium to
build the TGV under licence in South Korea.
Daewoo protested, calling the decision unfair. It said it had been
GEC-Alsthom's main partner when the Anglo-French group bid for the
high-speed train contract against Siemens of Germany and Mitsubishi of
Japan. GEC-Alsthom said Hyundai was selected as the consortium leader on the
basis of its industrial and technical capability.
Daewoo, expressing fears that it would not have access to technology
transfers if it remained a junior partner in the consortium, filed a suit to
block talks between GEC-Alsthom and the government on a final contract.
Following the dismissal of the suit last month by a South Korean court,
Daewoo has now agreed to join the consortium with the guarantee that it will
have full access to technology transfers, GEC-Alsthom said.

FT  16 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Gatt members warm to China's entry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, with the notable
exception of the US, yesterday expressed strong support for an early
resumption of China's Gatt membership and welcomed recent moves to
liberalise trade and relax foreign exchange controls.
However, the row between the US and China over human rights, which could
lead to non-renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation trading status in the US
market, is proving a big stumbling block to faster progress in the
negotiations on Gatt entry terms. China wants to rejoin Gatt by the end of
this year, so it can be a founder member of the World Trade Organisation
which succeeds Gatt in 1995.
Entry negotiations resumed yesterday after a six-month gap, allowing Chinese
officials to present details of Beijing's latest foreign exchange and trade
reforms. These included the unification of exchange rates and a managed
float of the currency since January, with a promise of full convertibility
by the year 2000, as well as tax reform and reductions in a wide range of
tariff and non-tariff barriers.
The response yesterday was generally favourable. The European Union said the
reforms appeared to be going in the right direction, and it and Japan
expressed hopes for an acceleration of the negotiations. However, the US
said it was not prepared to subscribe to 'an artificial deadline' for
Chinese membership.
At the same time, western nations are united in pressing China to pay a
still higher Gatt entry fee, including lower barriers to trade in industrial
goods and agriculture, improved market access for foreign services companies
such as banks, and better protection of intellectual property rights. Gatt
members also seek further moves to cut state intervention in the economy and
ensure trade rules are applied consistently.
China was an original member of Gatt but pulled out in 1950 after the
Communists came to power. The Beijing government applied to re-enter Gatt in
1986 and has taken a full part in the Uruguay Round of global trade talks.
However, progress in the membership talks, which began in 1987, has been
slowed by human rights concerns as well as the difficulty of getting to
grips with China's rapidly evolving trade regime.

Qantas, the large Australian airline in which British Airways holds a
minority stake, has said that it wants to re-start a service to China on
June 1 - a move which could sound the death knell for the fledgling
Australian carrier Australia Air International. AA secured rights to China
last year from the International Air Services Commission, which allocates
Australia's international routes.
At that stage, Qantas, which ceased operations to China in 1987, did not
make an application. AA had hoped to start operating in 1993, and even
published proposed schedules but the carrier subsequently failed to meet
IASC financial requirements. Qantas plans a once-a-week flight to Beijing
via Guangzhou, using a Boeing 767 aircraft.

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US-Japanese trade and economic relations are 'in serious disrepair,' Mr
Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, said yesterday.
Japan must take 'its full share of responsibility in promoting global
economic growth,' he told the House trade subcommittee. It had not yet done
that in bilateral talks with the US or in the Uruguay Round.
Mr Kantor, who has pursued a tough line in efforts to encourage Japan to
produce a market-opening package containing 'numerical indicators of
progress,' won warm support for his stance from both Republicans and
Democrats on the committee.
'Unless or until Japan is prepared to take their share of responsibility
we're not going to resolve these problems.'
The US, he said, had been 'somewhat victimised' with the characterisation
that it was proposing managed trade solutions. 'The Japanese have practised
managed trade for years,' he said. 'We're trying to unmanage trade in
Japan.'
Meanwhile it emerged in Tokyo that the US has presented Japan with detailed
proposals for measures to promote deregulation and market access.
The proposals, contained in a discussion paper, were delivered to Japanese
officials in January during the framework negotiations and cover 45 specific
areas.
The Japanese government has resisted demands made by the US under the
framework negotiations to set specific objective criteria in opening up its
markets. Instead, it has hoped to deflect criticism over its huge trade
surplus by taking the initiative in compiling the deregulation plan.
In competition policy, the US is calling for the abolition of exclusionary
business practices, active application of criminal charges under the
anti-monopoly law and substantial relaxation of rules governing transport,
airline, shipping and trucking fees.
In administrative transparency, the US wants more foreign participation in
government advisory groups, while in deregulation it seeks establishment of
an independent organisation to supervise progress in deregulating the
markets.
In distribution, the US is asking for infrastructural investment to improve
rail and road access to Japanese ports and airports, more warehouse space
for imports at Narita Airport, introduction of computer systems to handle
import matters before goods arrive in Japan and greater handling of imports
by small retailers.

The head of Mexico's largest financial group has disappeared in what police
are treating as a kidnapping.
Eyewitnesses said Mr Alfredo Harp Helu, president of Banamex-Accival, was
intercepted by armed men on Monday as he was being driven to work in Mexico
City.
The kidnappers have yet to make public their demands but have been in
contact with the Harp family, according to the police. The family has been
told not to co-operate with police authorities or make statements to the
press.
When news of Mr Harp's disappearance reached the Mexico City stock market,
Banacci B shares fell sharply, closing on Monday down 3.86 per cent on very
heavy volume. Shares continued to slide yesterday.
The New York security firm Kroll Associates confirmed it had been asked to
handle the case, but would offer no more information. Kroll won the release
of two businessmen kidnapped in 1992.
Kidnappers have targeted Mexican businessmen with increasing frequency with
over 2,000 kidnappings reported in the past five years. A source close to
the investigation said: 'It appears to be the work of a professional group.'

<TEXT>
Deloitte &amp; Touche has agreed to pay Dollars 312m (Pounds 209m) to settle a
string of government charges that the big US accountancy firm failed
properly to audit several banks and savings and loan institutions which
collapsed in the 1980s.
Yesterday's settlement resolved 15 lawsuits brought against Deloitte by
various government agencies seeking Dollars 1.8bn in damages.
The lawsuits charged Deloitte with professional negligence, claiming that
the firm issued clean audits for institutions that later proved to be
insolvent.
The settlement is the second largest paid by a professional firm involved in
the S&amp;L and bank failures. In 1992 accountancy firm Ernst &amp; Young paid
Dollars 400m after reaching a similar accord with federal authorities.
Although analysts believe that a large part of the Dollars 312m settlement
would be paid by Deloitte's insurers, the firm's partners are expected to
contribute toward the cost of the agreement. However, Mr Michael Cook,
Deloitte's chief executive, described the settlement as a 'business
necessity' and 'fair.'
The Deloitte settlement is not likely to be the last of its kind and further
settlements are expected.

An unexpected increase in industrial production last month indicates the US
economy is continuing to expand rapidly, increasing the chance of another
rise in short-term interest rates.
The Federal Reserve said yesterday industrial production rose 0.4 per cent
in February after 0.5 per cent in January. Most analysts had expected
production to be flat or down as a result of severe weather. The figures
suggest output is growing at an annual 7-8 per cent in the first quarter.
This suggests little slowdown in economic growth from the second half of
last year when gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of more than 5
per cent.
The Fed also reported a sharp increase in the rate of capacity utilisation
in manufacturing industry to 82.6 per cent - only fractionally below the 83
per cent level traditionally associated with rising inflationary pressure.
Separately the Commerce Department said producer prices rose 0.5 per cent
last month. However, this mainly reflected higher energy prices. 'Core'
producer prices (excluding the volatile food and energy components) rose 0.1
per cent, less than expected.
On Wall Street, bond prices closed higher as investors interpreted the
encouraging core producer price figures as a sign that rapid growth was not
yet putting upward pressure on inflation. The benchmark 30-year Treasury
bond rose 24/32 to yield 6.89 per cent in late trading.
However, the strong production figures and higher capacity utilisation rate
indicate the economy is growing faster than its long-run potential rate of
growth. This raises the chance that Fed governors and regional presidents -
who meet in Washington next week to discuss interest rate policy - will
tighten monetary policy again in coming weeks.
On February 4, the Fed raised short-term rates a quarter point to 3.25 per
cent, the first increase in five years. This led to a sharp rise in long
bond yields on the assumption that this was the first in a series of
tightening moves.
Hopes on Wall Street that economic growth would slow sharply taking pressure
off the Fed to raise rates are evaporating. New York bank J P Morgan, for
example, is projecting growth at an annual rate of 6 per cent in the second
quarter, after a brief weather-related slowdown to 3 per cent in the present
quarter. That would be not far short of the 7.5 per cent in the final period
of last year.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Small business role in job creation questioned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Small businesses have for years commanded the profound obeisance of
politicians and economists as the most fertile source of new jobs, and
ministers gathered in Detroit this week continued to pay homage.
But economists working under the aegis of the US Commerce Department's
Census Bureau have taken a swipe at the idea that small businesses create
more jobs than larger ones, in a new study examining the performance of
manufacturing industry from 1972 to 1988.
Economists Steven Davis, John Haltiwanger and Scott Schuh found that
although smaller companies created new jobs at a much faster rate than did
larger employers, they also destroyed jobs much more quickly.
Companies with fewer than 20 employees added an average of 16.5 per cent to
their workforces each year, the study showed, but they also destroyed an
average of 18.8 per cent of their jobs.
At the same time, companies with more than 50,000 employees created new jobs
averaging 6.3 per cent of their total workforces each year and destroyed 8
per cent on average.
'In a nutshell, net job creation behaviour in the US manufacturing sector
exhibits no strong or simple relationship to employer size,' the study says.
The Census Bureau economists also note that newly created jobs at small
manufacturing plants are much less likely to survive than new jobs at large
plants.
They complain of fallacious statistical presentations of the data on job
creation, suggesting that if a company drops in size below the cut-off point
for small businesses it can seem to increase employment in the small
business sector, even if it really represents a loss of jobs.
Since large companies account for most of manufacturing employment, they
also account for most of job creation and destruction. Small businesses, the
study shows, account for less than one fifth of job creation.
But from Mr Kenneth Clarke, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, to Mr
Paul Martin, Canadian finance minister, delegates in Detroit this week
hailed small businesses as the engine of job creation.
'There's an enormous amount of creative destruction in small business. I
think there's job loss in small business but there's also a lot of job
creation,' Mr Martin said.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Pressure for social clause in Gatt deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
France and Italy are leading a drive to include restrictions on child labour
and forced prison labour in next month's final round of negotiations on the
Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, France's economy minister, urged this week's Group of
Seven jobs conference in Detroit to press for 'a minimum of rules applied at
the international level'.
Italy strongly backed the French initiative, and both Canada and Greece,
which attended the Detroit meeting as current president of the European
Union, also expressed interest in some form of social clause to the Gatt
agreement.
French officials also expect partial support from the US, which introduced
similar protections in its North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada
and Mexico, and has been pressing similar demands in its talks with China
about the extension of Most Favoured Nation trading privileges. 'I am well
aware that the social clause is far from receiving unanimity,' said Mr
Michel Giraud, France's labour minister.
International trade union organisations have been pressing for a broader
social clause covering work safety standards, union rights and protection
against discrimination in the workplace.
But other G7 countries are reluctant to reopen the Gatt deal at this stage,
and trade experts say it is extremely unlikely that a social clause could be
inserted in the face of strong opposition from many Asian countries.

   DETROIT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Labour and finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial
nations yesterday wound up two days of discussions in Detroit about
unemployment and job creation in a warm glow of apparent harmony.
'It seemed to me that there was a new conventional wisdom emerging about the
whole question of unemployment,' said Mr Padraig Flynn, the European
commissioner for social affairs.
Ministers emerged from their meetings to say they were in broad agreement on
the need for macroeconomic policies that promote sustainable growth with low
inflation, but also that they shared a problem of structural unemployment
that would not be solved by growth alone.
'Everyone agrees it's both structural and cyclical,' said Mr Paul Martin,
Canada's finance minister.
At the same time, everyone agreed on the role of small business as an engine
of job creation, the need to improve education and vocational training and
the importance of offering the long-term unemployed a way to re-enter the
workforce.
With considerably less unanimity, the participants also spoke approvingly of
labour market flexibility.
Even when they used the same words, however, different ministers brought
different underlying meanings to them, reflecting both national and
functional divergences.
Besides occasional national splits - 'the Anglos against the rest', as one
Italian official put it - some delegations showed internal differences both
between the different political parties in their coalition governments and
between the different outlooks of labour and finance ministers.
'I've got a sense of cultural gulfs in other delegations,' said Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer.
On macroeconomic policy, the usual topic of G7 meetings, the Detroit
conference showed some of the customary disagreements.
The US argues that a considerable portion of the G7's current high
unemployment rates, particularly in Europe, must be attributed to the
recession, and therefore requires efforts to boost demand-led growth - by
interest rate cuts in Europe and by fiscal stimulus in Japan.
Japanese and European officials coolly noted the US argument, which Mr
Edmond Alphandery, France's economy minister, said had become 'quite
standard'. He noted that although continental Europe had higher unemployment
because it was at an earlier point in the recovery cycle, it was emerging
faster and with less pain than the UK and US had done.
Ms Laura Tyson, the chief White House economic adviser, insisted at the
opening that she would not accept the argument that structural policies
could replace cyclical policies as a recipe for dealing with unemployment.
US officials had expected some-thing of a row with the UK on this issue, but
other participants said that the argument quickly fizzled out when no-one
disagreed.
'We have never said that structural adjustments could replace a good
macroeconomic framework,' said Mr Henning Christophersen, vice president of
the European Commission.
On the issue of labour market flexibility, the division became clearer.
'Some seem to define flexibility as the freedom to fire workers and lower
wages,' complained Mr Robert Reich, the US labour secretary, calling for
more worker empowerment and training to help mobility.
Mr Clarke, the implicit target of Mr Reich's jibe, denied any substantial
rift between the UK and the US.
'The Americans in their presentations put less emphasis on labour market
flexibility than we do but the reason is that they already have a
deregulated labour market,' Mr Clarke said.
While ministers agreed on the need to reduce the cost of labour to
employers, they differed on the extent to which this reduction should come
from the wage packets of their workers.
Canada and France urged an attack on payroll taxes, which Mr Martin
described as 'a cancer on job creation', as well as a weeding out of social
security programmes that can harm job creation.
'We feel we can eliminate part of the social support system which is a
disincentive to work and keep the basics,' Mr Martin said.
All sides drew a sigh of relief, however, at the complete absence of support
for ideas such as protectionism or a shorter working week.
'The idea of a generalised reduction of the working week was raised by
no-one. No-one proposed closing their frontiers to fight unemployment.
No-one said we should tackle unemployment by slowing the rate of
technological progress. The most tangible thing to come out of it was the
refusal to simplify the problem,' said Mr Alphandery.
In their efforts to resist populist demands such as protectionism, G7
countries hope that the Detroit gathering will provide them with useful
political cover at home.
'We'll be able to say, see - the Germans and the French and the Canadians
and the Italians and the Japanese - well, we all have the same problems,'
concluded President Bill Clinton.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Clintons seek to divert attention from Whitewater
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton began a campaign-style swing through New Hampshire
yesterday, vowing to keep his eye on domestic policies despite attacks from
'people who are giving me hell in Washington.'
Mrs Hillary Clinton also continued the administration's attempts to divert
the nation's attention away from the Whitewater affair, stemming from the
Clinton's financial dealings in Arkansas in the 1980s, over which they have
come under heavy fire from Republicans in Washington.
Mrs Clinton was due to address a rally in St. Louis on the second day of a
trip promoting the administration's healthcare reform plan.
On Monday night the President launched an impassioned attack on his
Republican critics and made a plea for a nationwide debate over what he
called the issues of concern to Americans.
'This overriding negative, intensely personal, totally political
devoid-of-principles attack is not good for the country,' he said. 'It is
inconsistent with the tradition of Abraham Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt.'
He described himself as 'an old-fashioned' man, who believes in the contest
between good and bad and that good wins out.
'We have to appeal to what is good in this country,' he said. 'We have to
ask people to face hard truth and debate hard issues and come together and
think new thoughts about problems that we are frankly not solving today.'
Mr Clinton appeared yesterday morning at a gathering of citizens in the
small New Hampshire town of Nashua, where he got heavy support during his
campaign for president.
In the friendly New Hampshire crowd, he found at least one who agreed with
his attempt to refocus the national debate.
'I'm 68 years old,' one woman told him. 'Whitewater is for canoeing and
rafting. Shame on those who would detract and distract from the important
work you're doing with universal health coverage and jobs.'
'Thank you ..bless you,' Mr Clinton said.

FT  16 MAR 94 / High pay for the few in a city out of work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just five miles down the road from the jobs summit conference centre in
Detroit the brand new Jefferson North Chrysler car plant is a standing
affront to much of the G7 debate about job creation. The highly automated
plant, which produces the Grand Cherokee jeep, is one of the success stories
of the town's revitalised car industry.
None of the jobs summit delegates would object to the 200 robots or the
automated paint spraying and welding at the plant, which reduces the number
of employees to about 3,000. But the policymakers would not approve of the
fact that, in a town where unemployment is double the national average at 13
per cent, so much employment is hogged by the securely employed 'insiders'.
Average weekly working hours at the two-shift plants are 55 to 60 hours,
with average annual take-home pay of more than Dollars 50,000 (Pounds
34,246). Most employees work from 6am to 3.30pm, plus three Saturdays in
four.
Chrysler and the United Auto Workers union collude to maximise work and
income for those already in a job, and until recently most new recruits were
relatives of existing employees. Yet Detroit has lost 250,000 auto-related
jobs in the past 10 years and there are 23,000 people on the books of the
state employment agency who want to work at Jefferson North. A few hundred
of them may be lucky if the plant decides to put in the third shift. Anybody
who gets a job will find a plant with harmonious working relationships and
strong powers for organised labour. The UAW not only has a closed shop, it
also has equal representation on the key committees which decide most of
what goes on.
Mr Charles Matthews, a semi-skilled assembly line operator, who has worked
for Chrysler for 30 years, said: 'The hours are long but this is the best
plant I've ever worked in.' He retires in two months, aged 55.
Unlike some other US car makers Chrysler took on existing workers when the
new plant opened up, which meant an average age of over 50. There were big
retraining programmes for technicians but training in general seems less
important than many summit delegates assume.
One Chrysler supervisor admitted that many of the semi-skilled jobs take
only about half an hour to learn. There is no job rotation for those on
repetitive tasks but most workers are part of a small team and training for
less skilled workers concentrates on building up team-working skills.
Jefferson North would make only a small dent in Detroit's unemployment
problem even if it was maximising rather than minimising employment
opportunities. Although the town's prospects are improving, and it has a
dynamic mayor in Mr Dennis Archer, the Clinton administration has exposed
its unemployment sores to the world by staging the job summit here.
In central Detroit the unemployment rate climbs to 17 per cent and blacks
aged 16 to 19 have an unemployment rate of 41 per cent. Sobering statistics
for those Europeans who thought the American labour market had all the
answers.

The US has informed Japan it is considering claiming damages against
Japanese construction companies which allegedly fixed contracts to build a
US navy base in Japan, government officials acknowledged yesterday, writes
Michiyo Nakamoto in Tokyo.
Mr Kozo Igarashi, minister of construction, said the ministry will
investigate US allegations that 73 Japanese contractors conspired to fix
contracts to build the US navy's Atsugi Base between 1984 and 1990 and
charged inflated prices for their work.
The US has informed Japan's foreign affairs ministry that it is preparing to
seek damages of Y1.1bn (Pounds 7m) against the Japanese contractors, Mr
Igarashi said yesterday. 'As the ministry which oversees and instructs the
industry, we will look into the matter and deal with it appropriately,' the
minister said.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Japan trade surplus with US declines in February
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's trade surplus with the US fell for the first time in nine months in
February, the ministry of finance said yesterday.
The slight drop in the surplus will help reduce tension with the US. But
Washington will need further and more substantial falls over an extended
period before it is convinced the problem has been solved.
The surplus with the US was Dollars 4.344bn (Pounds 2.9bn) in February, a
fall of 0.9 per cent compared with the same month last year. Imports from
the US rose 15.1 per cent, while exports grew by 6.8 per cent.
Car sales in the US were down sharply, hindered by the strong yen, but
exports of semiconductors continued to rise. Imports of US computers, food
and machinery surged in February, as did aircraft deliveries.
Analysts said the level of the surplus with the US, which was below
expectations, would help support the dollar against the yen.
Japan's overall trade surplus was up 3.3 per cent in February compared with
the same month last year, reaching a record Dollars 10.912bn, although the
increase was lower than that in previous months. In December and January,
the surplus rose 15.5 per cent and 17 per cent respectively. In yen terms,
the surplus, which had risen in January, dropped 9.1 per cent to Y1,186bn.
Japanese exports rose 5.6 per cent to Dollars 29.532bn, while imports grew 7
per cent to Dollars 18.62bn. Imports of food, including foreign rice, were
up 20.3 per cent year on year.
The growing importance of Japan's trade with other Asian countries was
underlined by a 2.6 per cent increase in exports to Asean nations and a 0.7
per cent rise in imports. Exports to China were up 0.8 per cent while
imports rose 3.6 per cent.
The markets were surprised by a rise in domestic machinery orders placed by
the private sector during January. These orders represent a leading
indicator of capital investment intentions. A fall of about 6 per cent had
been expected, but they increased 1.9 per cent against the previous month,
data released by the Economic Planning Agency showed.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Settlers ready to be martyrs or heroes: Hebron Jews could
spark war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A photograph of Rabbi Meir Kehane, the slain Jewish racist who advocated
religiously sanctified Jewish violence against Arabs, is proudly displayed
in the bedroom of a 13-year-old boy in Hebron, the city that has become a
flashpoint of Israeli-Palestinian violence.
'I don't agree with Kehane but when a boy grows up and his father is stoned
and his friend's father is murdered by Arabs, you must understand why he
might see Kehane as a hero,' says the boy's mother, Mrs Ruth Hizmy.
Rising Jewish settler militancy has become the greatest political threat to
the government of Mr Yitzhak Rabin and the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process. At the least, the settlers promise a nationwide campaign of civil
disobedience to resist evacuation from Palestinian areas. At worst, rising
emotions, fears and Jewish religious fundamentalism could explode into a
Jewish-Arab civil war and even Jewish-on-Jewish violence.
The 40 Jewish families settled in Hebron are in the vanguard of Jewish
militancy. Hebron is the breeding ground of the two Jewish terrorist groups,
Kach and Kehane Lives, banned by the government this week.
The Hebron massacre has worsened the settlers' tendency to be an insular
community sustained by the belief they are on a mission from God to maintain
a Jewish presence amid the 110,000 Arabs who live in Hebron, burial place of
the biblical patriarchs Abraham and Jacob, and an area sacred to both Moslem
and Jew.
They refuse to see Hebron as occupied. For them it is an intrinsic part of
the land of Israel promised to the Jews by God. Part of their cultism is
reflected in their deep belief they are being victimised, not only by the
Arabs but by their 'treacherous' Jewish government. They believe all
outsiders do not understand them and are part of a conspiracy to defeat
their religious goals.
Like all messianic cults, they have martyrs and heroes and a powerful faith
in the sanctity of dying for one's beliefs. They strongly believe in
expanding their numbers by breeding; the average family has six children,
and talking to the children is like talking to the brainwashed.
Mrs Shani Horowitz, originally from New York, moved to Hebron because she
wanted to live somewhere 'where by just sitting I was doing something for
the Jewish people.'
In passionate and often angry tones, she says the Hebron settlers are like
the early Jewish pioneers who built the state of Israel through settlement.
'Hebron is spiritually and geographically the centre of Jewish life. Because
we live here, Jews can come and visit the sites and holy places. We are the
messengers. We are sitting here for the rest of the country.
'Evacuating Hebron is like evacuating the Wailing Wall. Hebron is the second
most important Jewish city after Jerusalem. We are very much on the front
line, on a mission as soldiers. We are holding on tight to the land of
Israel. We are redeeming this place from being barren of Jews.'
The government's timid moves against the settlers has exposed the weakness
of Mr Rabin's political will. He fears that acting against the Hebron
settlers will fuel right-wing opposition to the peace process and force the
government into surrendering a powerful pawn in the drawn-out negotiation
with the Palestinians.
But the government's refusal clearly to state the long-term line of its
withdrawal from occupied Arab land has bound all 125,000 settlers together
in common cause with the Hebron settlers. The belief is that any move
against Hebron is the thin edge of the wedge. Most of the cabinet realise
that Hebron and some other settlements will have to be evacuated sooner or
later; the more the government delays, the more strongly organised the
settlers become.
Yesterday, hours before an anti-government demonstration, the Yesha council
of Jewish settlements said: 'It is inconceivable that a Jewish government
could make Hebron Judenrein (clean of Jews) ..The Rabin government has no
mandate for an 'ethnic cleansing' of Hebron or to carry out its policies of
capitulation (to the PLO).'
The settlers are preparing a campaign of fierce civil disobedience against
any effort to evacuate them. They have urged the army to disobey orders, and
implicitly threaten violence. 'If the government tries to evacuate Hebron it
will be a declaration of war against the Jewish people,' said Mr Noam Arnon,
a Hebron settler. 'We are not going to move. We are not going alive. They
will have kill us.'
Mr Arnon says settler leaders are calling for non-violence because they know
that violence damages their cause. But he warns that if the army leaves,
Hebron settlers will take up arms against the Arabs in a civil war. Jewish
law has a strong prohibition against Jewish-on-Jewish violence, but Mr Arnon
says that if the army tried to evacuate Hebron by force, 'with deep
emotional and religious feeling, people might lose self-control. Then,
horrible, terrible things might happen.'
With up to 15,000 army-issued automatic weapons in the settlers' hands, ten
of thousands of licensed handguns and the possibility of secret arms caches,
these are threats the government cannot take lightly. But the more the
government delays a political decision on settlements, the more the settlers
threaten the fragile peace process, and the stability of the government
itself.

International Monetary Fund officials were present to hear the plea. The IMF
is rushing through soft-loan agreements to help CFA countries get relief
from international creditors.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Oxfam attack on World Bank

<TEXT>
Oxfam, the British charity, yesterday called for 'an open acknowledgment of
the scale of sub-Saharan Africa's development failure', Michael Holman
reports. World Bank-supported structural adjustment programmes had failed to
'generate sustainable growth and significantly reduce poverty,' it said.
Adjustment programmes 'were preoccupied with lowering inflation through
interest rates and unrealistic money supply targets'. Poorly-planned import
liberalisation measures' had 'exposed potentially competitive local
industries to ruinous competition from imports'. Oxfam accused the bank of
'complacency' in the face of Africa's 'deepening development crisis'.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) team inspecting nuclear

said yesterday, Patrick Blum reports from Vienna. 'Restrictions were
applied, stopping us making some tests,' the IAEA said last night.
The team which spent 15 days in North Korea was able to visit all seven
declared nuclear facilities as agreed with Pyongyang last month. One of the
plants where the experts faced curbs was at the main nuclear complex at
Yongbyon, north of the capital. The team will report back this morning. A
formal IAEA board meeting could be called next week.

A strike over free political activity halted underground work at the Kloof
mine, one of South Africa's most profitable gold producers, for the second
day running yesterday. Kloof is responsible for about 5 per cent of the
country's gold output of 620 tonnes a year.
The strike, by 11,000 of the mine's 16,000 workforce, is the biggest in the
sector since 1991. It comes in the middle of a campaign by the National
Union of Mineworkers to win concessions from Gold Fields, Kloof's parent
company.
An NUM official said workers had given a list of grievances, including an
alleged ban on political activity on mine property. The union had not
received a response and this had led to the strike. A Gold Fields official
said the management had responded.
Gold Fields has before now declined to take part in the industry's wage
bargaining forum, unlike the rival mining houses Anglo American, Gencor,
Johannesburg Consolidated Investment and Randgold.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Mandela enters Bophuthatswana in triumph
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MMABATHO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, yesterday made a
triumphal entry to the Bophuthatswana capital, Mmabatho, congratulating the
people of the black 'homeland' for ousting President Lucas Mangope, and
issuing a veiled warning that the same might happen to Zulu Chief Mangosuthu
Buthelezi.
Some 40,000 people cheered wildly as Mr Mandela entered the futuristic
'Independence Stadium' built to commemorate Bophuthatswana's granting of
independence from South Africa in 1977, a sovereignty which only Pretoria
recognised. He had harsh words for Chief Buthelezi, leader of the KwaZulu
black homeland, saying last week's events in Bophuthatswana would 'send a
signal' to him and to the white right-wing.
'The people have risen and tyrants have fallen. This message will not be
lost on people living under other toy tyrants in this country,' he said, a
comment which bordered on a direct invitation to the people of KwaZulu to
revolt. His remarks will not improve the political situation in Natal, where
at least nine people were killed yesterday in fighting between the ANC and
Chief Buthelezi's Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom party.
Nor do they improve prospects for the success of talks later this week
between Mr Mandela and Zulu King Goodwill Zwelethini, aimed at ensuring
Inkatha's participation in the first all-race elections in April. The king
has strong links to Inkatha, through Chief Buthelezi, who is chief adviser
to the monarchy.
Mr Mandela denigrated the threat from Inkatha, saying he would suffer 'no
sleepless nights' over its promise to disrupt elections. The right wing, and
by implication Inkatha, were 'no more than those who bark without being able
to bite,' he said.
ANC leaders, who previously expressed grave concern at the right's ability
to disrupt elections, have gained confidence since armed right-wing whites
were chased out of Bophuthatswana on Friday, after briefly occupying the
capital. This new confidence is likely to undermine the ANC's commitment to
negotiate a deal to bring Inkatha, the only remaining party boycotting the
poll, into a constitutional settlement.
Mr Mandela arrived in Mmabatho yesterday morning to a low-key reception in
the streets, with very few people turning out to greet his motorcade. Later
in the day, the largest crowd ever seen for a public event in Bophuthatswana
turned out at the Independence Stadium, but it remained about a third empty.
The stadium, visible across many kilometres of the flat Bophuthatswana veld,
is widely seen as a symbol of President Mangope's rule: the upper sets of
seats are set at angles which form attractive silhouettes against the sky,
but make it impossible to see the pitch from anywhere but the central
stands.
Mr Mandela condemned looting that destroyed Mmabatho's shopping district,
but ANC officials made clear to business people an ANC government would not
compensate them for what officials implied was a necessary part of the
liberation struggle. Still, Indian business people, many of whom lost all
their stock, turned out to greet and garland the ANC leader. One Asian
businessman said after the meeting: 'The Indian community are jumping on the
bandwagon. They used to support Mangope, now they support Mandela.'

<DATELINE>
   KOTA KINABALU, EAST MALAYSIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The national front coalition government in Malaysia led by Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad appears likely to assume power in the state of Sabah, East
Malaysia, after several members of the dominant local political party voiced
support for Dr Mahathir.
Sabah is one of only two states in the Malaysian federation not controlled
by parties in Dr Mahathir's national front. In bitterly fought state
elections last month the locally constituted Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS), led
by Mr Joseph Pairin Kitingan, the chief minister, narrowly defeated the
national front and retained its control of the Sabah assembly.
But in recent days PBS's majority has been threatened by a number of
defections by its assembly members to the national front. Yesterday Mr
Jeffrey Kitingan, a younger brother of the chief minister who was elected as
a PBS assemblyman in last month's elections, announced he was forming a
political party which would join Dr Mahathir's national front coalition.
Mr Jeffrey Kitingan, who was recently released after being detained for
three years on suspicion of wanting to take Sabah out of the Malaysian
federation, has said that Sabah could progress and develop through
membership of the national front.
Dr Mahathir has made no secret of his antagonism to the PBS and to Mr Pairin
Kitingan in particular. The PBS accuses Dr Mahathir of withholding federal
funding for Sabah's development and says the national front has paid
millions of dollars to win support of PBS assembly members.
The national front now seems certain to command a majority in the state
assembly, which is due to hold its first meeting on Friday since the recent
election. Earlier this week Mr Pairin Kitingan asked the Sabah governor to
dissolve the assembly and for new elections to be held.

The Swedish krona is likely to float for an extended period and remain

have learned from developments in recent years is that we must first get the

that European interest rates would continue to decline. 'Monetary policy is
unchanged in Europe despite the recent turbulence (in markets), which means
continued successive interest rate cuts.'

Spain should stop letting its citizens visit its museums free of charge
because the practice of only charging tourists is discriminatory, the
European Court of Justice ruled yesterday. Spaniards, foreigners living in
Spain and holidaymakers under 21 can visit any state museum free of charge,
but foreign tourists over 21 have to pay. The European Commission took the
Spanish government to court arguing it was breaking European law by
discriminating against people on the grounds of nationality. Charging
foreigners effectively restricted their freedom of movement since museums
were 'one of the determining reasons' tourists were attracted to a country,
the Commission said. Spain said it believed its open doors policy was not
discriminatory since it included some nationals from other EU states.

The importance of hedge funds to the financial markets has been exaggerated
in the recent debate over whether such funds should be regulated, according
to Mr Edgar Meister, a member of the Bundesbank board. The main wish of the
world's central bankers, including the Bundesbank, was for more transparency
to observe more carefully the impact of the growing derivative business on
the markets, specifically on market interest rates and on money supply, Mr
Meister said. Hedge funds were only one of several powerful forces
contributing to turbulence in the bond markets. There were also mutual
funds, banks and brokers, Mr Meister said. Private investors should be
calmed by the fact that the volatility in the capital markets was only
temporary. Germany did not face big credit risks on account of hedge funds
because the borrowing activity of such funds was regulated and limited in
Germany, unlike in the US, Mr Meister said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Government measures to stimulate the French motor industry have prompted a
strong response and should result in at least 150,000 extra car orders this
year, Mr Gerard Longuet, the industry minister, said yesterday. The measures
include a payment from the government of FFr5,000 (Dollars 870) for car
owners who trade in vehicles more than ten years old to buy a new one,
helping to prompt 54,000 extra orders in February compared with January,
according to Mr Longuet. He forecast continued improvement and estimated
that total car sales this year should exceed 1.9m, compared with 1.72m in
1993. The measures, which also include extra tax breaks for company fleets,
have been matched by discounts from car producers. French manufacturers have
benefited most, with Renault and Peugeot enjoying a stronger increase than
the average 35 per cent. Mr Longuet said it was vital to revive car sales,
which fell more than 18 per cent last year. Mr Longuet said that it was
vital to revive the depressed car sector, which was severely hit by
recession last year and contracted by more than 18 per cent. 'The automobile
sector is one of the principal motors of the economy and represents more
than one million jobs' he said. 'It is an ideal target to help stimulate
consumption.'

FT  16 MAR 94 / German retail sales edge up: Economic Watch
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Retail sales in western Germany were 2 per cent higher in January than in
the same month last year. Sales in the whole of Germany were up 3 per cent,
2 per cent higher than in December. The increase was led by a 14 per cent
year-on-year rise in sales of cars and components. Pharmaceuticals sales
were up 11 per cent, and home furnishings 9 per cent. There was a 1 per cent
drop in sales of food, drink and tobacco, and a 4 per cent fall in textiles,
clothing and shoes. Overall economic activity in Germany 'increased
noticeably' around the turn of the year, the economics ministry said. The
ministry cited growing foreign demand, 'lively' housebuilding and 'further
clear progress' in eastern Germany's recovery as factors underlying this
resurgence.
Russia's industrial output rose 2.3 per cent in February from January, but
was 24.1 per cent below the level of a year earlier, the sharpest drop since
start of reforms in 1992. Some 4,280 enterprises shut down some or all
production last month.
Spanish industrial producer prices rose 1.1 per cent in January, compared
with a 0.2 per cent rise in December and 0.8 per cent in January 1993. The
monthly increase brings the rate for the year to 3.6 per cent in January.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Ciller to pay at polls for cash crisis: The Turkish
government's first political test after presiding over a sharp fall in the
lira and a liquidity squeeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turkey's prime minister, Mrs Tansu Ciller must have told them their cheque
was in the post. That at least is how one observer explains the gloomy faces
of Turkish motorway contractors when they left a meeting with the prime
minister still owed seven months in payments.
After less than a year in office, Mrs Ciller's conservative-led coalition is
facing a desperate search for cash to meet its ongoing expenses.
It is a problem that will almost certainly affect the performance of Mrs
Ciller's Truth Path party (DYP) in municipal elections across the country on
March 27.
Turkey is in the middle of the most damaging financial crisis since the
banking collapse of the early 1980s. After a decade of capital market
reform, recent currency turbulence has underlined just how vulnerable the
economy is to policy error.
With interest rates on government paper having risen to 125 per cent and the
international bond markets for developing country debt suffering the jitters
in the wake of the rise in US rates, Turkey is finding it increasingly
costly to borrow. Privatisation receipts have not been as large as
projected. Meanwhile, most of the tax changes recently introduced will not
have an impact on revenues until 1995.
The government's problems deepened last week when it was forced to 'pull'
its Dollars 750m global bond issue. There are civil servants and public
works contractors to pay, farm prices to subsidise, and debts to service,
and bankers are worried a big liquidity crunch is on the way.
The road builders are just the latest creditors to come knocking on the
government's door. The contractors had to settle for a package of tax relief
and three-year bonds in lieu of the Dollars 700m owed for work completed.
The work programme for 1994 has been sharply curtailed.
The government's response to the crisis and the run on the lira has been far
from convincing. Sir Leon Brittan, the European trade commissioner, during a
visit to Ankara last month, urged the Turkish authorities to introduce
austerity measures to underpin the gains from the 12 per cent devaluation in
January.
Instead Mrs Ciller set alarm bells ringing by suggesting Treasury bill
liabilities should be converted into new five-year paper, in effect a
domestic rescheduling.
What was puzzling was the Treasury's announcement that it is to issue
convertible bonds in the state telecom company, even though the telecom
company is still not privatised and all moves to prepare it for sale remain
blocked by the courts. There were even press reports, quoting government
officials, that undercover agents had been ordered to infiltrate the money
markets in the belief that it was Kurdish separatists who were trying to
destabilise them.
The crisis reflects the loss of local and international confidence in Mrs
Ciller's leadership. The bold rhetoric that accompanied her appointment has
never been matched by the reality of her policies. Her reformist instincts
have been frequently blocked by opposition from her coalition partners, the
Social Democratic Populists.
'Everyone has lost out,' said one disillusioned Turkish businessman.' The
central bank's reputation has been damaged, so has the Treasury's. Reserves
are depleted. And the small investor has got badly burnt.'
Polls suggest that in the municipal elections on March 27 Mrs Ciller's DYP
will limp in a poor fourth behind the Motherland party Anap, the main
opposition party, the Social Democratic Populists, and the Islamic based
Refah RP.
The election is the first real test of Mrs Ciller's popularity since she was
voted party leader by the DYP congress last June.
A professional economist and a political outsider, Mrs Ciller seemed to
offer the best hope of restoring the country's fortunes and forging its
western identity. Today if Mrs Ciller survives the current turmoil, it will
probably be less the result of any real political achievement than the fact
that the DYP is unable to find a credible alternative leader.
Her policies, centred on finding ways to finance the budget rather than
addressing the need to bring the deficit to heel, are attacked by leading
economists. Her attempts at more structural changes, such as pushing through
large-scale privatisation, tax reforms and curbing civil service pay rises,
have been limited because of divisions in her coalition and have done little
to ease budget pressures.
Also criticised has been her management style on which the resignations of
two successive central bank governors have been blamed. What was seen as her
mishandling of the 12 per cent devaluation in January badly dented the
bank's prestige. Moreover central bank reserves have fallen by as much as
Dollars 3bn since the beginning of the year to about Dollars 4.5bn early
this month.
Some bankers say Mrs Ciller has in large part brought the troubles on
herself. The local bond market has all but dried up as a direct result of
her unorthodox and ultimately failed attempt to push down domestic bill
rates. The current uncertainty has pushed rates on government paper up 30
points since the second half of 1993. Even at 125 per cent for one-year
paper, there are few buyers. As one banker put it: 'It's no longer enough to
have an interest rate policy. Something more is needed.'
After 7 per cent growth in 1993, forecasts for this year are being marked
down. One western economist says Turkey could see negative growth in 1994,
making it even more difficult for business to rebuild.
In such a climate, said one economist, bankruptcies would be unavoidable,
particularly for those dependent on government payments, such as
contractors. Banks too, will feel the pinch, caught out with large foreign
exchange exposure at a time when the lira's depreciation is accelerating.
Today Turkey displays all the symptoms of an economy where inflation is
heading out of control. No one wants to hold lira. On pay day, Turkish civil
servants rush to the exchange shops. Even divorces are sometimes settled in
hard currency.
Some foreign banks worry the lira could fall even more sharply unless a
serious structural reform programme is introduced.
Few Turkish observers hold out much hope of that in the current political
uncertainty.

Italian journalists yesterday began a four-day strike in protest over plans
by the Ciampi government to place some of the surplus in the journalists'
pension fund in the main state-operated pensions scheme.
The strike provoked dismay among political parties who have been relying on
the media for coverage in the final 11 days of the general election
campaign.
The stoppage will affect all newspapers today and Thursday, and television
and radio on the following two days.
The stoppage is the result of a long-running battle between the journalists
union and the government over the pension fund. As part of an effort to
boost the fast depleting coffers of the state-operated pension scheme, the
Ciampi governmment decided last year to raid the surpluses of separately
operated, but state-run entities, controlling the pensions of the various
professions.
The strike comes as Italian journalists have for the first time come under
investigation for corruption. Three prominent economic writers are being
investigated by Milan magistrates for allegedly receiving money from the
Ferruzzi-Montedison group.
The investigations follow revelations by Mr Carlo Sama, the former managing
director of Ferruzzi-Montedison who has admitted large-scale illicit funding
of poltiical parties.
Mr Sama said he had submitted to Milan magistrates the names of several
journalists who had been paid sums of money to help improve
Ferruzzi-Montedison's image.
The journalists deny the allegations. They are Mr Giuseppe Turani, of La
Repubblica, Mr Osvaldo De Paolini, former City editor of the business daily
Sole-24 Ore, and Mr Ugo Bertone of La Stampa.
Italian journalism has claimed much credit for exposing the corrupt links
between business and politics.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Merchant bankers brave disdain of Athens: The Greek
socialists know they must pay the price as telecom sell-off brings back the
fee seekers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Undeterred by Greece's failure last year to carry out a planned partial
flotation of the state telecommunications company, OTE, western investment
bankers are pushing back into Athens for another try.
With the socialist government committed to relaunching its conservative
predecessor's privatisation programme, to help cover a rapidly widening
budget deficit, the sale of 25 per cent of OTE is being set provisionally
for October.
However, plans for the flotation are still vague, not least because the
socialists, after their election victory last year, sacked the previous
government's two leading advisers on privatisation, N M Rothschild and
Credit Suisse First Boston, without appointing a replacement.
Moreover, in the absence of Mr Giorgos Gennimatas, the economy minister, who
is undergoing treatment for cancer, the prime minister, Mr Andreas
Papandreou, has not indicated who will be responsible for awarding the
mandate for the OTE sale.
It will be a delicate political decision, given the opposition to the sale
voiced by OTE's powerful trade union, and a prevailing mood of hostility
towards foreign investment bankers within the ruling Panhellenic Socialist
Movement (Pasok).
A senior socialist official said: 'We're naive perhaps, but we were shocked
at the size of the fees the conservatives were prepared to pay to foreign
consultants.'
Both Rothschilds and CSFB were advising the previous government on its plan
to sell a 35 per cent strategic stake in OTE to an international operator.
In addition, CSFB and J Henry Schroder Wagg were appointed global
co-ordinators for the flotation of another 14 per cent of the company on the
Athens stock exchange, expected to raise about Dr100bn (Pounds 274m).
Rothschilds, together with Morgan Stanley and Paribas, were originally
appointed joint lead managers of the offering's international tranche. But
both the sale and flotation were cancelled when the conservatives lost power
in the general election last year.
The socialists' disdain for international advisers extended to firing Arthur
Andersen, the accountants, who were preparing OTE's first audit up to
international standards.
They are to be replaced by auditors from SOL, a quasi-government body of
Greek-sworn accountants.
Nevertheless, economy ministry officials now accept the need to appoint an
international bank as co-ordinator to ensure the success of what will be the
largest local offering to date.
However, the ministry is already admitting that political criteria will
affect the final choice. 'Obviously, we can't reappoint the old team, even
though a few players may be asked to participate again,' a government
adviser said.
Almost all the banks previously involved have submitted fresh proposals.
However, confidence is strong among newcomers, among them Bear Stearns,
Lehman Brothers, Barings and Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
The government hopes to realise Dr250bn from the OTE sale, with up to 60 per
cent of the issue being placed abroad.
'They appear to be counting on the current appetite for telecoms issues
among international investors to offset delays in restructuring
old-fashioned management and a lack of transparency in the accounts,' said
one analyst.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Exports boost for engineering sector in Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Export growth will help Germany's engineering industry increase sales by 2
per cent this year. But a further 100,000 jobs will have to go, and a
sustained recovery will not emerge until 1995 and 1996, according to the
VDMA industry association.
Stronger growth was not possible because of weak domestic demand, and the
industry's average net return on sales of less than 1 per cent was too low
to finance investment, modernisation and new jobs, Mr Jan Kleinewefers,
association president, said.
Growing demand from outside Europe for German machines had been apparent for
a year, and in the past two months there had been signs of a change for the
better in west European orders, which were no longer slowing, he said.
However, average capacity utilisation was still at a record low of 75.6 per
cent at the end of last year. Only four sectors - steel plant, textile,
packaging and woodworking machinery - were working at satisfactory rates of
85 per cent or more. Highlights of last year - the worst since the war, and
marred by a 11 per cent slump in industry-wide sales to DM209bn (Pounds
81.3bn) - included a 10 per cent increase in sales to the US, Mr
Kleinewefers said. The US was now the industry's biggest single foreign
market. Exports to China doubled to DM4bn, helping bolster sales to east
Asia by 15 per cent. However, domestic orders fell a real 15 per cent, and a
drop of 13 per cent in demand from other European Union countries meant
total foreign orders rose only 1 per cent.
Turnover from export deliveries fell a real 7 per cent to DM110bn, but
machinery imports also shrank 12 per cent, leaving the sector showing a
trading surplus of more than DM50bn. Between the onset of the recession in
1990 and the end of last year, the plant and machinery industries - second
only in terms of sales to the automotive sector - had seen output fall by 20
per cent. Some 200,000 jobs had been lost in the west of the country.

<TEXT>
Russia will not only cut grain imports to a minimum this year, but intends
to export 2m tonnes, the deputy agriculture minister, Mr Vladimir Shcherbak,
told a government commission meeting, Reuter reports from Moscow.
RIA news agency quoted him as saying domestic supplies were sufficient to
meet most demand, but there would still have to be some small imports of
certain types of grain.
These should include 100,000 tonnes of corn seed, already covered by
preliminary agreements and waiting in western ports to be delivered, Mr
Shcherbak said. But foreign companies were seeking finance ministry payment
guarantees before making shipments, and the agreements could still fall
through, he said.
Russia imported about 11m tonnes of grain in 1993, down from 25m tonnes in
the previous year.
Mr Shcherbak gave no details of the planned exports.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday served notice that it intends take a more
active role in policing joint ventures in the fast growing
telecommunications market.
Mr Philip Lowe, head of the Commission's merger task force, said the
Brussels authorities would be looking closely at industry proposals for
co-operation which might restrict competition. He told the Brussels
Telecommunications Forum that technology was moving so fast that it was
outstripping decision-makers and posing a challenge to regulators. 'Frankly,
we have to watch it.'
Mr Lowe predicted the European Union would have to accelerate its agreed
timetable for liberalising national markets for voice telephony from
January, 1998 - a view shared widely inside the Commission.
Mr Lowe's speech provided the first clues on future regulatory policy in
telecoms, a booming market which could see most of Europe's state companies
privatised before the end of the century.
Mr Lowe suggested two areas where the competition directorate would either
extend its powers or 'clarify' existing jurisdiction:
Lowering the thresholds above which Brussels automatically vet deals, from
Ecu250m (Pounds 189m) annual turnover in the EU market to Ecu100m. This is a
long-standing Commission goal; but Mr Lowe said telecom ventures usually
started with a low turnover but could grow very quickly into big players.
Examining the definition of industrial 'co-operation'. Joint ventures may
not amount to market concentration but they could still restrict
competition, Mr Lowe suggested.
In the past year, the directorate's merger task force has vetted 10 cases
involving telecoms operators, including a British Telecom proposal to
provide valued added services with MCI, the US telecoms company. Overall, it
looked at 200 cases in all industrial sectors.
In one case, Philips, the Dutch electronics giant, withdrew a proposal for a
joint venture with Siemens for an optical fibre cable project.
Mr Lowe reminded industry of the advantages of dealing with Brussels
competition authorities. Takeovers of a certain size are automatically
investigated within a month.
Where serious doubts exist about their effect on competition, they are
subject to a four-month inquiry. Separately, companies considering joint
ventures or mergers can seek informal guidance.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Russia to raise tariffs on range of imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pressure from Russia's powerful industrial and agricultural lobbies, coupled
with fears of rapidly falling government income, have persuaded the
government to bring in sweeping new import tariffs.
The tariffs, the subject of several decrees not yet published, are reported
by the Interfax news agency to raise the average tariffs from 6-7 per cent
to 15 per cent.
All imported food will be subject to a 15 per cent tax, while white sugar
will carry a 20 per cent tariff and cigarettes a 30 per cent import tax.
Tariffs on cars and perfume will also go up sharply: the changes will mean
that foreign cars will carry a tax of between 40-60 per cent.
The move appears to mark a success for Mr Alexander Zaveryukha, the deputy
premier with responsibility for agriculture, who had argued for a 25 per
cent rise in white sugar prices to protect domestic producers. At the same
time, however, tariffs on imported spare parts needed to re-tool industry
have fallen to 5 per cent.
The other main reason for the increase in tariffs is the rapidly decline in
government incomes, with the take from taxes running at little over half of
what was expected. The shift to tax foodstuffs which are bought largely by
the minority of wealthy Russians and the foreign community who buy at
largely foreign-owned shops can be put through with a minimum of political
pain.
At the same time, the choice of goods which are subject to the new tariffs
shows that the government has not abandoned itself to wholesale
protectionism, leaving large sectors unprotected and imposing on only a very
few commodities - weapons, caviar, matches and concentrated alcohol - a 100
per cent tariff increase.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Portuguese take on banks: Consumers boycott debit cards in
protest against surcharge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Portugal's hard-pressed consumers took on the country's big banks yesterday
 -organising a 24-hour boycott of their widely used direct debit cards in
protest at an attempt by the banks to charge commission on use of the cards.
They were responding to an angry appeal by consumer associations,
supermarket chains, petrol stations and other businesses to protest against
a decision by banks to charge a commission of 1 per cent on purchases made
with the cards.
Shop owners said banks would earn Esc8bn (Pounds 30.7m) to Esc10bn a year
from the charge, due to be levied from April. They warned they would be
forced to pass on the extra cost to consumers because retail profit margins
were already low.
The Multibanco card system in Portugal, considered the most advanced in
Europe, allows consumers to shop, pay utility bills, dine out and book train
tickets without using cash or cheques. The cost is immediately debited from
their bank accounts and paid into the account of the supplier.
The system, run by Sociedade Interbancaria de Servicos (SIBS) for almost all
Portuguese banks, provides 3,000 automatic teller machines countrywide where
cardholders can withdraw and deposit money, consult their accounts, and
order cheque books. Retail outlets are equipped with 30,000 electronic
points of sale (Epos) integrated into the system.
'We will take the banks to court for operating a cartel,' said Mr Jorge
Morgado of the Deco consumer association that led the call for a boycott.
'They all plan to introduce the same charge at the same time without
offering consumers any choice.'
Mr Luis Cid, SIBS director, said it was natural that banks should seek to
regain operational costs through a charge for a service that has been free
since it was introduced in 1985. Three years ago British consultants
estimated each Multibanco operation cost Es100, considerably less than the
cost of processing a cheque.
The decision to levy a charge on card use comes as falling interest rates
are sharply reducing earnings from loans and deposits and banks are seeking
to improve their balance sheets through commissions and fee-based income.
However, the use of cards has allowed banks to reduce staff levels. It has
also improved services for customers, who until recently had to wait in long
queues for the simplest of banking services.
'We want banks to be flooded with cheques as a result of the boycott to
remind them of what a boon the Multibanco system has been to them,' said Mr
Morgado. He said Deco had been overwhelmed by messages of support and
challenged a statement from SIBS that use of the Multibanco system yesterday
was normal or even above average.
Paying for his lunch yesterday with cash instead of a card as usual, Mr
Paulo Garcia, a computer engineer said: 'The banks have enticed us into the
Multibanco system over the past eight years by levying no charges. 'Now they
want us to pay. I support the boycott and will stop using my card for
purchases altogether if they go ahead with the charge.'

FT  16 MAR 94 / SPD election victor puts party on alert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A supremely self-assured Mr Gerhard Schroder, the victorious Social Democrat
prime minister in the state of Lower Saxony, swept into Bonn yesterday to
warn his party colleagues against over-confidence in their own coming
election campaigns.
It was a moment of vindication for Mr Schroder, who was defeated last year
in the contest to become national leader of the Social Democratic party
(SPD) by the altogether more modest Mr Rudolf Scharping, the state premier
of the Rhineland-Palatinate.
This time he was coming back as a winner from the very first poll of
Germany's 1994 election marathon, which will see 18 more polls culminating
in the general election on October 16.
His emergence from Sunday's state election in Lower Saxony with an absolute
majority - albeit only of one seat - means that he can rule without any
coalition partner. That is a luxury enjoyed by the government in only five
other states of the 16 in the federal republic.
Mr Schroder was magnanimous in his victory. He paid tribute to the Greens
who had been his partners in the first red-green coalition in Germany, and
will undoubtedly still be needed to provide some support for his wafer-thin
majority. At the end of Sunday night, his SPD had won 81 of the 161 seats in
the Hanover-based state parliament, against 67 for the Christian Democratic
Union, and 13 for the Greens.
The biggest losers were the Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU, which lost 5.6
percentage points to win just 36.4 per cent of the vote, and the Free
Democratic Party (FDP), his coalition partner in Bonn, which failed to gain
the minimum 5 per cent needed to win any seats at all.
Yet Mr Schroder's main warning was to his own SPD party colleagues, not to
relax in the forthcoming election campaigns and regard them as good as won.
And he spoke out strongly against national policies which might prove
disastrous vote-losers in the campaign, such as a national speed limit on
the autobahns, and an increase in taxes on petrol and oil products.
Mr Schroder, whose victory is seen very much as a personal triumph, admitted
he was facing an exhausted CDU in Lower Saxony, with a serious shortage of
personalities in its leadership.
Yet one man had shown he could make a difference in the last two weeks of
the campaign, he said: the arrival of Mr Kohl himself showed that the ruling
party could still boast 'a notable and battle-hardened election campaigner'
who should never be under-estimated.
It was no doubt a neat reminder to his erstwhile SPD rival, Mr Scharping,
about the harsh struggle ahead. Mr Schroder pledged his loyal support to his
national leader, but he firmly ruled out any future role in Bonn for
himself.
He was speaking just five days before the next test in the election
marathon, when 2.1m voters in the state of Schleswig-Holstein must elect new
local councils on Sunday - and where the SPD itself is facing a backlash in
the polls.
State officials of the CDU are hoping to push the SPD into second place and
to emerge once again as the largest party, reversing the positions of 1990.
The biggest loser from the Lower Saxony election was the Free Democratic
party, which failed to gain even the minimum 5 per cent needed to win seats
in the state parliament.
And in spite of its loss of power in the coalition, the biggest winner was
the Green party, which pushed up its vote from 5.5 to 7.4 per cent.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Balladur settles feud on defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur has settled a feud between his defence and
budget ministers over future military expenditure by deciding that armaments
spending should rise annually by 0.5 per cent in real terms until the end of
the century.
Mr Balladur engineered the compromise as the government prepares to present
to parliament next month the 1995-2000 military framework law. This does not
absolutely tie a government's hands over annual defence budgets, but since
France is likely next year to elect a president from the ranks of the
governing coalition - even perhaps Mr Balladur - it will be a good guide to
future defence spending.
Mr Francois Leotard, the defence minister, had pushed for a rise in military
equipment spending of 2.5-3 per cent a year, taking as his text the recent
government-approved defence white paper. It said real 'annual growth of at
least 3 per cent' was needed to fund all programmes underway, though it
acknowledged greater efforts could be made to keep arms suppliers' charges
down and foresaw some savings through 'a certain pause' in modernising
France's nuclear deterrent.
Mr Nicholas Sarkozy, the budget minister, argued that the armed forces
should be subject to the same financial discipline as the civil sector. The
government's five-year fiscal programme, designed to fit France to enter
monetary union with Germany and other European partners by the late 1990s,
calls for an average 0.4 per cent cut in public spending in each of the next
three years.
Mr Balladur's decision to allow arms spending to continue to rise modestly
will appease the strong defence lobby inside the government coalition, but
will mean more severe cuts in civil programmes. France's 1994 defence
equipment budget of FFr100.4bn (Pounds 11.5bn) is already higher than that
of other European allies, with Britain planning to spend about 60 per cent -
and Germany only 27 per cent - of the French level this year, according to
French defence officials.
President Mitterrand's two-year old moratorium on French nuclear tests in
the south Pacific has provoked strong complaints from within the government
majority, but without saving much money because the government has started
research into laboratory simulation of such tests. The Elysee yesterday
welcomed President Clinton's decision to prolong until autumn 1995 a similar
moratorium.
Another general drain on the defence budget has come from France's heavy
involvement in United Nations peace-keeping operations in ex-Yugoslavia and
elsewhere. Last year this cost France FFr7bn, of which only FFr1.5bn will be
reimbursed by the UN.
The German government yesterday approved new guidelines for the armed forces
which call for the build-up of rapid-reaction forces under Nato's post-cold
war strategy of crisis management, Reuter reports from Bonn.
The guidelines, laid down in a policy document to be published next month,
spell out Germany's new international role after unification and detail
changes in the military force structure. 'This is the first building block
of the future Bundeswehr (Federal Armed Forces),' Mr Volker Ruhe, defence
minister, said. There were instances in international crisis management
where 'military means are necessary to prevent, limit or end violence,' he
said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The euphoria in the eastern German town of Hotensleben, some 185km west of
Berlin, when the Iron Curtain was dismantled has turned to amazement and
anger since their local leaders decided to rebuild part of it as a monument
to the cold war, Reuter reports from Berlin.
Eager to halt the decline of Hotensleben since German unification, a small
group of civic dignitaries last year began rebuilding a 330-metre (1,080ft)
section of the 'death strip' which kept east Germans from escaping to the
west. Hoping to slow a sharp rise in unemployment and reverse a demoralising
westward migration of many of its 2,600 citizens, they decided to capitalise
on the town's isolated location during the cold war with a unique tourist
attraction.
They have spent DM135,000 (Pounds 52,500) - some of it government money - to
repair and rebuild it, complete with guard towers, spotlights and attack
dogs.
'It's pure insanity,' said Dr Franz Wehe, a retired surgeon who lives next
to the rebuilt wall. 'That damn thing was here for 30 years so why do we
have to look at it now?' Nearly 500 people in Hotensleben have signed
petitions protesting against the monument.
The monument was to have been completed by 1996 but the protests brought a
quick halt to federal funding. Annoyed and undaunted, the proponents are
seeking DM300,000 in private funding to complete the monument.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Microsoft reorganises to meet market challenges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Microsoft of the US, the world's largest personal computer software company,
yesterday announced a worldwide reorganisation to improve decision making
and market responsiveness.
It said the new structure was necessary to achieve its goal of doubling
sales over the next four years. Last year the company had net income of
Dollars 953m (Pounds 652m) on sales of Dollars 3.75bn.
Microsoft says the reorganisation will not lead to job losses, in contrast
to the experience of other computer companies. 'It will not reduce our
overall headcount, but it will allow us to grow without increasing our head
count as much as our current organisation would require,' the company said.
A memorandum sent to employees says the company could seize 'incredible
opportunities' in the next few years, but implies that competitors,
including Lotus and Novell, are superior in sales and marketing: 'We cannot
just follow and react to what others are doing.'
Restructuring is expected to take between two and three months, with all the
key elements in place before the start of Microsoft's new financial year in
the autumn.
The company denied the reorganisation was a response to an investigation of
its business practices being carried out by the US Justice Department. Last
year, the US Federal Trade Commission failed to agree whether to proceed
against the software company after more than three years of investigation
into whether Microsoft had abused its position as market leader.
Microsoft, boosted by sales of MS-Dos and Windows personal computer
operating software, has shown quarterly earnings growth of between 25 and 55
per cent in recent years. In the first quarter of the current year, however,
growth slowed to 14 per cent. Analysts suggested the company was maturing
and rivals were eating into its market share.
The reorganisation is designed to accelerate decision-making, simplify
marketing messages to customers and business partners and improve
efficiency. Seven product groups are to be created to cover, for example,
personal operating systems and desktop applications. New customer units will
be responsible for individual users, organisations and companies which build
Microsoft software into their own products.
Microsoft believes central Europe could become its single largest market,
with the potential of Dollars 1bn in yearly sales.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Britain blocks agreement on EU voting rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European Union foreign ministers failed last night to break a deadlock over
voting rights in an expanded union after the UK held out for yet another
meeting to settle the issue.
The 12 are expected to resume talks in Brussels next Tuesday but angry
ministers said they had in effect given the UK and Spain an ultimatum on the
voting rights issue and were not prepared to make any further concessions.
The UK and Spain are resisting any dilution of their right to block
decisions in the EU Council of Ministers when Austria, Finland, Norway and
Sweden join the EU next year.
Senior negotiators said Britain and Spain had been offered a compromise
solution which would allow them to delay decisions to which they objected.
But they made clear there could be no question of a small minority of EU
states indefinitely holding up decisions.
Mr Jacques Poos, the Luxembourg foreign minister, said last night the
ministers had settled membership terms for Norway after resolving a row over
fishing rights, putting even more pressure on the UK and Spain to reach an
agreement. Entry terms for Finland, Sweden and Austria have already been
agreed.
The EU foreign ministers' meeting next Tuesday would be their fourth attempt
to resolve the crisis over enlargement of the Union to 16.
'Positions have hardened rather than moved closer together,' said Mr Alain
Lamassoure, French European Affairs Minister. There are fears that further
delay on the voting rights dispute might sink the chances of the four
newcomers joining the EU in January as planned.
A senior British government official made clear yesterday that the UK could
not yet work its way around the voting rights dispute, which it acknowledges
may jeopardise prospects for the 'wider Europe' London says it espouses.
'You have to realise how (any weakening of UK veto rights) could play in
Westminster' among rightwing, Europhobic members of the British parliament,
the official said.
Mr John Townend, chairman of the powerful Tory backbench Finance Committee,
said opposition to watering down Britain's rights was spread right across
the party. 'This is a case of blackmail, to put it bluntly. The Commission
is proposing watering down voting rights to have enlargement of the
Community.'
Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, asked in parliament to clarify the
government's negotiating position at the foreign ministers' meeting, said:
'What we need to ensure is that democratic legitimacy and the rights of
minorities are sustained within the European Union.'
One rightwing backbencher said privately: 'The prime minister has been told
that he risks his majority in the Commons if he allows the Foreign Office to
agree to any compromise over our blocking veto.'
In Brussels, enormous pressure was placed on the British, including calls
for a vote that would expose them as the obstacle preventing the move from a
Europe of 12 to 16.
The UK wants to change the proportion of weighted votes in the Council of
Ministers needed to block EU laws. Currently, 30 per cent of the votes can
form a 'blocking minority'.

FT  16 MAR 94 / Further Dollars 1.5bn loan urged for Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Group of Seven leading industrial countries, fearful that the Russian
economy may collapse, are pressing the International Monetary Fund to agree
to lend the second Dollars 1.5bn tranche of funds aimed at assisting reform.
Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, is expected in Moscow tomorrow.
During his five-day visit he will have to decide whether to recommend to the
fund's board to pay the second tranche of the systemic transformation
facility. If he recommends delay, factors in his decision will be fears that
the budget will not be adhered to and that inflation - down to a monthly 9
per cent in February - will again soar, as expected.
A continued fall in production and the huge indebtedness in Russian industry
have meant that government income is running at half of the budgeted figures
for the first two months of this year.
Meanwhile, powerful lobbies, especially the military, are demanding higher
allocations than presently allowed. General Pavel Grachev, defence minister,
says that his troops will go unfed unless the allocation to defence of
Rbs37,000bn (Pounds 14.4bn) for this year is more than doubled.
One senior western financial expert in Moscow said yesterday: 'The base to
support the infrastructure of the country is shrinking and at some point
soon you will not have enough resources to support the minimum services.'
Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, prime minister, has sought to impress on the IMF
that he and his senior colleagues are at least as pro-market as radicals
such as Mr Yegor Gaidar and Mr Boris Fyodorov, who left the cabinet this
year. An IMF team is negotiating with Russian ministers in Moscow.
Mr Chernomyrdin has drawn up a list of companies to be declared bankrupt,
has enthusiastically endorsed the sell-off of state and collective farms to
individuals, and says he will repel all advances from the military,
industrial, energy and agricultural lobbies for more credits.
However, he has also tried to make clear to the IMF the severity of the
crisis he faces. The draft budget envisages expenditure of Rbs183,000bn and
income of about Rbs120,000bn - leaving a budget deficit of about 10 per cent
of gross national product, a figure regarded as tight in present
circumstances. The draft has not yet gone to the lower house of parliament
for ratification.

FT  16 MAR 94 / High street spending slows as tax rise nears: CBI survey
shows second month of weak retail sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Retail sales growth slowed for the second month in succession in February as
consumers restrained their spending ahead of next month's tax increases.
The Confederation of British Industry said its new distributive trades
survey confirmed that unimpressive sales in January were more than a 'flash
in the pan'. The data showed that last month retailers reported the lowest
year-on-year increase in sales since volumes started to rise in January
1993.
The weakness of consumer demand suggested by the survey may increase
pressure on the government to ease interest rates, particularly if today's
official retail sales and unemployment figures confirm the gloomy picture.
However, other figures yesterday pointed to robustness in the UK building
industry. Construction orders won by contractors were 30 per cent higher in
the three months to January 31 than in the corresponding period 12 months
earlier.
The figures, published by the Department of the Environment, indicated that
the upsurge in orders since the autumn was continuing, providing further
evidence that the recession in the industry might be coming to an end.
The CBI said it was not particularly concerned by the slowdown in retail
sales growth. Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the confederation's
distributive trades panel, said this trend probably reflected the fact that
some consumers were anticipating the impact of the tax increases which are
due to take effect in April.
'Equally, other consumers may also be holding back until they are sure just
how much their pay packets will be affected,' he said.
Retailers were confident that they would 'weather the storm' of tax
increases. Mr Whittaker said: 'It will cause a bit of a blip for a month or
two. But the underlying trends suggest we are going to emerge from it in a
satisfactory way.'
Overall, 40 per cent of retailers surveyed said that business was higher
than it was in February 1993, while 30 per cent said it was lower. The 10
per cent balance between the two figures compared with a positive balance of
15 per cent in January, and was the smallest since January 1993.
Only 16 per cent of retailers surveyed said sales were good for the time of
year, while twice as many - 33 per cent - thought they were poor. The
balance of minus 17 per cent represents a further decline since January,
when the balance was minus 15 per cent.
Inflation continues to show few signs of picking up, according to the
survey. A positive balance of 20 per cent of retailers reported that prices
were up on 12 months earlier. With the exception of January's balance, that
was the weakest price trend reported since the survey began in 1983.
The survey also showed that imports were increasing their presence in
British shops. The CBI said the proportion of deliveries from suppliers
accounted for by imports increased in the year to January. A positive
balance of 1 per cent in January rose to 7 per cent in February.

FT  16 MAR 94 / EU expansion talks face collapse

<TEXT>
Talks among European Union foreign ministers to settle the row over
power-sharing if the 12 take in four new members next year were on the verge
of collapse last night, with the UK holding out for yet another meeting to
settle the issue.
Any further delay on the voting rights dispute might sink chances of
Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden joining the EU next January as planned,
and brake the momentum behind the Union's expansion.
The UK, which with Spain is resisting any dilution of its right to block
decisions in the EU Council of Ministers, predicted last night that further
negotiation would be needed - possibly at a summit of European leaders.
A senior British government official said: 'There will be another meeting,
but we don't know the level, the time or the place.' But he made clear that
the government could not yet work its way around the voting rights dispute,
which it acknowledges may sabotage prospects for the 'wider Europe' London
says it espouses.
'You have to realise how (any weakening of UK veto rights) could play in
Westminster' among rightwing, Europhobic members of the British parliament,
the official said.
Mr John Townend, chairman of the powerful Tory backbench Finance Committee,
said opposition to watering down Britain's rights was spread right across
the party. 'This is a case of blackmail, to put it bluntly. The Commission
is proposing watering down voting rights to have enlargement of the
Community.'
Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, asked in parliament to clarify the
government's negotiating position at the foreign ministers' meeting, said:
'What we need to ensure is that democratic legitimacy and the rights of
minorities are sustained within the European Union.'
One rightwing backbencher said privately: 'The prime minister has been told
that he risks his majority in the Commons if he allows the Foreign Office to
agree to any compromise over our blocking veto.'
However, Sir Norman Fowler, Conservative party chairman, predicted that
there would be no revolt by Conservative Euro-sceptics over UK voting rights
in Europe.
In Brussels, enormous pressure was being placed on the British, including
calls for a vote that would expose them - and the Spanish if they do not
climb down - as the obstacles to the move from a Europe of 12 to 16.
Germany, France, the Netherlands and Denmark all suggested that those who
opposed the will of the EU majority on how to manage this first stage of the
Union expansion should 'go away and reflect', as Mr Niels Helveg Petersen,
Danish foreign minister, put it.
Mr Alain Lamassoure, France's European affairs minister, asked the British
to stop wasting time. 'The final result is not in doubt. The sooner they
realise that, the better.'
The UK wants to change the proportion of weighted votes in the Council of
Ministers needed to block EU laws and regulations. Currently, 30 per cent of
the votes - distributed roughly according to size among member states - can
form a 'blocking minority'.
Arithmetically, the UK and Spain's partners argue that that means the
present arrangement of 23 votes out of 76 should move to 27 out of 90 once
the Nordic and Alpine countries come in.
Spain is happy to see the blocking threshold raised to 27 votes, but under
conditions.

The G7 countries had relaxed their pressure on the IMF and the other
international financial institutions such as the World Bank to lend to
Russia after the December elections, as the outcome led them to believe that
further reform was unlikely.
Mr Chernomyrdin has drawn up a list of companies to be declared bankrupt,

envisages expenditure of Rbs183,000bn and income of about Rbs120,000bn -
leaving a budget deficit of about 10 per cent of gross national product, a
figure generally regarded as tight in present circumstances.
The income, however, is proving wildly optimistic. Government insiders said
yesterday that government income, mainly from taxes, was running at only
some Rbs70,000bn to Rbs80,000bn a year.

Tax Havens and Their Uses
by Caroline Doggart
Economist Intelligence Unit, Pounds 75
183 pages
Bjorn Borg and Boris Becker do it in Monaco; Anthony Burgess and Alistair
MacLean do it - or did it - in Switzerland; Arthur C. Clarke does it in Sri
Lanka.
Many well-known personalities are among those heading to sunny tax shelters,
but potential new fugitives should think carefully before they begin to pack
their bags. Things are changing rapidly in the world's tax havens, and those
who are caught out could be badly burnt.
'No amount of tax savings can make up for a life of loneliness and a lack of
affinity with foreign surroundings,' warns Caroline Doggart, in her survey
of offshore centres. And those that change their minds can be heavily
penalised if they make the wrong choice and move back home.
This guide - written in a very clear style reminiscent of The Economist -
offers an excellent introduction to the subject, which avoids jargon or
excessive technical detail. It provides a useful trot through the range of
tax-haven topics, including their history, company registration, personal
and corporation income tax and the relationship with other tax authorities.
There is also an important and lighthearted  - if somewhat superficial -
discussion of the lifestyle in the different havens. It does perhaps appear
to veer slightly too sympathetically towards tax flee-ers rather than tax
collectors.
Switzerland, it seems, was the world's first tax haven. Campione, on the
border of Switzerland and Italy, has become one by default since both
nations abdicated their fiscal responsibilities for the region. Minerva,
between Tonga and Fiji, was mooted recently as the world's only underwater
retreat. Albania and North Korea lack income tax but also, warns Doggart,
lack amenities. There is no tax on Ascension Island and just 4 per cent on
Norway's Svalbard Islands. But, as an official feasibility study for the
Falklands Islands concluded, havens in warmer climates have a distinct
advantage.
Doggart includes on her list some surprising candidates: France and Italy in
Europe, on some grounds; and even the US for many Europeans, because of its
comparatively low federal tax rates - even after US President Clinton's
latest rise.
Powers of investigation by tax authorities vary greatly. The US Internal
Revenue Service is particularly zealous in hunting down tax evaders. France,
India and the US all offer statutory awards for informers.
Eastern Europe is now beginning to get in on the act, with Hungary offering
a high degree of banking secrecy. By contrast, Switzerland's wall of secrecy
has now been pierced so frequently, says Doggart, that it is more like
Gruyere than granite.
Readers may sometimes find the structure of the report - based around themes
rather than countries - a little irritating if they are gathering
information on a single location. In compensation, the whole document is
sufficiently short and lucid to be skimmed through quickly.
Some of the examples mentioned are also beginning to look a little dated.
The UK Inland Revenue's penchant for dawn raids, for example, might have
been better illustrated by that on Nissan in 1991, rather than Rossminster
in 1979.
Because it is heavily oriented towards practical advice, the report fails to
pull out wider themes. It would have been useful to read more about the
changing pressures on havens, and what future they have as the trends in the
burden and collection of tax around the world have shifted. But, as Doggart
says, havens will continue as long as governments impose new and burdensome
tax legislation. So, too, no doubt, will guides like this.

FT  15 MAR 94 / FT Review of Business Books (27): Withering away, but not as
Lenin expected - David Lubin on essays which highlight the fate of the state
over the past decade, and question the market's value for developing
countries / Economics

Market Forces and World Development
edited by Rene Prendergast and Frances Stewart
St Martin's Press (distributed by Macmillan), Pounds 45
217 pages
Angel Gurria, the Mexican finance official who steered his country through
the debt crisis of the 1980s, is fond of making a neat rhyme by describing
Mexico's economic reforms as a series of shuns: privatisashun, trade
liberalisashun, deregulashun and fiscal consolidashun.
For most developing countries, these policies - and the underlying belief
that the market provides the most reliable way of allocating resources in an
economy - have acquired the status of an unimpeachable conventional wisdom.
In the third world's more or less open-armed embrace of market forces, the
biggest loser of all has been the state, whose former prominence in economic
decision-making has been pretty thoroughly undermined.
Ironically, Lenin's catchy prediction - that the state would wither away -
is apparently being proved right, albeit not quite in the way envisaged.
Here is a book that draws attention to the state's miserable fate over the
past decade or so. Most of its 11 essays try to poke holes in the argument
that the market necessarily delivers the best possible results for
developing countries. Some of the authors do this by relying on economic
theory; others do it by looking at some of the bad side-effects of the
'adjustment' process, hoping to show that something must be wrong with
economic policies that frequently leave the most disadvantaged groups in a
society worse off than before.
The best of the theory-laden essays is a provocative but jargon-filled
effort by Peter Smith, who challenges the idea that any step towards a
market-based solution must be better than nothing. One of the biggest
problems he sees is that the arguments in favour of the market are usually
couched in terms of the theoretical ideal of perfect competition, which is
supposed to lead to an 'optimal' situation where no one person can be made
better off without making somebody else worse off.
Unfortunately, as Smith points out, the real world is rarely if ever
perfectly competitive, and policymakers can make big mistakes by assuming
that it is. Indeed, 'the presence of an obstacle to free competition and
exchange may require the introduction of taxes, regulations and so on
elsewhere, to restore optimality'. Paradoxically, there are times when
markets work better with more state intervention, not less.
By far the more successful essays in this book are the ones that pay more
attention to the real world than to theory. Dharam Ghai's essay on
structural adjustment shows how one of the legacies of the 1980s has been a
worsening of income distribution profiles, both internationally and within
developing countries themselves.
Between 1970 and 1989, the countries with the richest 20 per cent of the
world's population increased their share of the world's income from 74 per
cent to 83 per cent, while the countries with the poorest 20 per cent of the
world's population saw their share of global income dwindle to just under
1.5 per cent. Meanwhile, income inequalities and the level of absolute
poverty have increased throughout most of Latin America and Africa, and Ghai
worries about the effect these developments will have on social cohesion in
developing countries.
A similar picture emerges from Frances Stewart's essay on the effects that
adjustment policies have had on education. Adjustment puts pressure on
public finances, and in most cases leads to falls in real wages. Stewart
argues that this combination has reduced not only the supply of education by
the state, but also the demand for education - poor households with falling
incomes find it more difficult to send their children to school, since they
become more dependent on the wages that children can earn if they work
rather than spend time getting educated.
In turn, this can lead into a vicious circle, as countries lose all the
benefits of having an educated people. These benefits extend well beyond the
obvious one - better labour productivity - since they affect a nation's
overall welfare, too: babies are more likely to die prematurely if they are
born to uneducated mothers, who will overcompensate for their loss by having
even more babies.
Stewart's plea - with which it is difficult not to sympathise - is for
governments to try to combine adjustment with growth, or at least to protect
education from the effects of deflationary adjustment, either by spending a
little less on defence, say, or by concentrating harder on revenue-raising
than on expenditure-cutting.
The book provides some good evidence that we live in a world that cries out
not so much for less government, but for better government. Recently, it
seems, a number of countries are latching on to this. In Mexico, Chile and
Argentina, political debate has become much more focused on the need for
governments to be more effective providers of welfare, particularly to
eliminate poverty. Still, the question remains: could governments in these
countries ever have raised the resources needed to eliminate social
injustice had they not shunned their way through economic reform?

campaigner's past extremism / Strategic planning

<TEXT>
The Rise and Fall of Strategic Planning
by Henry Mintzberg
Prentice Hall, Pounds 19.95
458 pages
Henry Mintzberg, a management professor at Montreal's McGill University, has
spent the last 20 years campaigning around the world against the
ultra-rational, mechanistic, highly detailed, and mainly top-down sort of
strategic planning popularised in the 1970s by the Boston Consulting Group,
and in the 1980s by Harvard's Prof Michael Porter.
The results of such planning processes are often rendered inadequate or even
dangerous by shifting events. In their place he has championed the
diametrically opposed idea that strategy is only effective if it is created
by a trial-and-error process of 'crafting' - a combination of intuitive
anticipation, and rapid reaction to events. Rather than being planned in
deliberate detail beforehand, on the misguided assumption that companies can
'know' the future, the Mintzberg doctrine is that effective strategies often
'emerge' from outside events, or from the everyday actions of
entrepreneurial managers at all levels.
Since the mid-1980s, his message has penetrated a growing number of
companies. Over the same period, events in the 'real' world - of politics,
economics and industrial competition - have reinforced the realisation that
no amount of detailed planning can help companies such as General Motors,
IBM, Kodak, Philips and Volkswagen react to - let alone anticipate and mould
 -their constantly shifting environment.
One might, therefore, expect a book with this title to be a mere celebration
of the defeat of Mintzberg's bete noir: the left-brain processes (linear,
verbal, analytical and purely rational) which have always dominated the
teaching and practice of corporate strategy.
The book certainly celebrates the sort of right-brain thinking (intuition,
pattern-recognition, and synthesis) which he has always advocated. But it
does much more than that. In a phrase, it represents the mellowing of
Mintzberg.
His documentation of planning's fall from grace is thorough in the extreme.
He explains at length, for instance, why there is such a gulf between
'strategy' and 'planning'. The first may be either an emergent 'pattern', or
what he calls a deliberate 'perspective'. He defines the second as merely 'a
formalised system for codifying, elaborating and operationalising the
strategies which companies already have'.
Most of his criticisms of the old strategic planning school are fair, if
brutal. It suffers from two key fallacies, he says. The first is that
thought should be detached from action, with strategy decided only by top
management and central staff, rather than by practising managers. The second
fallacy is that planning, despite being a purely analytical activity, can
create the sort of synthesis which is required to develop strategy. As he
says: 'Strategy-making is an immensely complex process involving the most
sophisticated, subtle and at times subconscious of human cognitive and
social processes.'
Lesser butts of Mintzberg's criticism include: top management's mistaken
faith in supposedly 'hard' data; the propensity of some managers still to
cling to the discredited world of medium and long-term forecasting; and the
enthusiasm of others for the 'multiple scenario' techniques pioneered by
Shell.
Only on the last of these does Mintzberg misread reality, and mislead the
reader: Shell's approach is not, as he claims, based on the idea that, since
the future is unpredictable, 'then by speculating on a variety of futures,
you might just hit upon the right one'. In reality, the essence of Shell's
admittedly complicated approach is to encourage managers to develop
strategies which are resilient to very different possible futures.
Mintzberg's peccadillo is unfair, but not venal enough to take the edge off
the freshness of the final quarter of the book, where he rehabilitates
planning and planners.
Instead of working in their old top-down way, Mintzberg argues that planners
have critical roles to play in support of line managers. They should
challenge managerial thinking by posing the right questions, not by seeking
the right answers. They should help 'articulate, justify and elaborate'
(fill-out) the strategic vision of leaders at any level.
Mintzberg calls this sort of activity 'strategic programming', but says it
need not always be formal. Instead, he even acknowledges that planners may
need in some cases to act as what he calls 'strategy finders': recognising
and broadening the impact of strategies 'emerging' unnoticed from the
organisation's experimentation and messy learning, or from the actions of
its competitors.
In other words, a degree of rationality and planning matters after all. 'Too
much planning may lead us to chaos, but so would too little, and more
directly,' Mintzberg concludes. That is obvious commonsense, but it is still
quite a volte-face from his past extremism. In many ways, the book's title
should be reversed to 'the fall and rise of planning'.

The Seven Cultures of Capitalism
by Charles Hampden-Turner and Alfons Trompenaars
Doubleday, New York, Dollars 25
404 pages
This new study offers insight into how different business cultures and value
systems influence behaviour and success in the commercial worlds of seven
countries.
It stems from a questionnaire given to 15,000 managers from the US, UK,
France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Japan between 1986 and 1993.
The framework used to compare their values and business cultures is a set of
seven 'valuing processes' that come into play when a society chooses how to
create wealth.
The first valuing process is 'making rules and discovering exceptions'. Each
country, and each organisation within it, must set generalised rules,
procedures and routines, while at the same time making special exceptions to
those rules.
The other six cover the extent to which a culture analyses or integrates;
relies on the individual (vs. the community); feels in control of its fate
(vs. control by external forces); does things in sequence (vs. in
synchronisation); expects status to be achieved (vs. ascribed); and desires
equality (vs. hierarchy).
Many of the responses are illuminating. For example: should a
poorly-performing subordinate, who you know has trouble at home, expect your
protection against others in the department? Most American managers (95 per
cent) said the subordinate had no right to protection. Attitudes were
similar in Germany (94 per cent), Sweden (91) and Britain (84). By contrast,
only 56 per cent of Japanese and 43 per cent of French managers agreed with
this view.
The book devotes three chapters each to the US and Japan, and some of the
most interesting material concerns the differences in the way they approach
almost every dimension of business. The analysis explains why the two
countries have found their trade negotiations so difficult.
The authors explain the more subtle reasons why things go wrong. The
American preference for analysis leads them to seek clarification of the
details first. After all, reason Americans, if the numbers don't add up,
there is no point in going to a lot of trouble to develop a relationship.
The Japanese, on the other hand, prefer 'integrating', which makes them
approach a situation cautiously. They need to sense whether a harmonious
working relationship is possible, and whether the potential partners are
trustworthy, before they bother with the numbers. The Japanese manager feels
he can deal with the details further down the road if the relationship has
potential to succeed.
The chapters on Germany, France, Britain, Sweden, and the Netherlands each
show a depth of understanding that is rare in the comparative genre. The
authors explain why the US, with its universalist, individualistic,
analytical, egalitarian mindset, has been so successful at producing
products with universal appeal - such as McDonalds, Levis and Coca-Cola.
These values, however, also handicap the US in important ways. They stifle
creativity and discourage managers from relying on mentors or caring for
employees. They encourage high executive turnover, reducing the incentive to
train anyone. They foster hostile takeovers and an over-reliance on
profitability as a yardstick of success.
The chapter on Britain offers a rich and complex explanation of why its
industry is in decline. One of the main culprits, say the authors, is that
Britain has been unable to resolve the seven value dilemmas.
'Wealth-creation is a function of the resolution of dilemmas facing a
national economy.' The problem with Britain is that it has a love affair
with words. It enjoys intelligent discourse, oratory, rhetoric - anything
other than solving the dilemmas.
The authors recite the familiar list of British inventions lost, sold, or
given away (the jet engine, steam turbine, penicillin, the computer, the
hovercraft) due to a lack of interest in the squalid business of exploiting
their commercial value.

Labour Legislation and Public Policy
by Paul Davies and Mark Freedland
Clarendon Press Oxford, Pounds 45.00 (hardback)
Pounds 19.95 (paperback)
692 pages
This massive and comprehensive study of the relationship between labour law
and governments since the second world war deserves to enjoy a readership
beyond that of labour law students.
It is far more than just a legal textbook, and of genuine value to anybody
interested in what remains one of the most important subjects in post-war
British politics.
Not only do the authors provide a full and succinct account of the
development of industrial relations legislation, from the days of full
employment in the late 1940s to today's flexible labour market; they also
relate this to a wider political context.
The book shows how the minimalist system, based on voluntarist principles
(so-called laissez faire collectivism) that believed employers and trade
unions alone should decide the outcomes of collective bargaining, came under
pressure from the demands of an increasingly interventionist state committed
to full employment and economic growth.
From the early 1960s, successive government attempts were made to replace or
modify voluntarism with a more legally regulated system.
The authors themselves would like to see the creation of a 'more stable, yet
juridified system of labour law' in Britain which would combine 'individual
industrial justice with collective representation' in a 'socially balanced
and reasonably humane political economy', as in most of the European Union.

The New American Workplace: Transforming Work Systems in the
United States
by Eileen Appelbaum and Rosemary Batt
Obtainable from ILR Press, Ithaca, New York, Dollars 40.00 hardback,
Dollars 18.25 paperback
278 pages
The American workplace is being transformed at a rapid pace under the impact
of global market pressures. Companies are cutting costs and improving their
competitiveness at a time when collective bargaining and private-sector
trade unionism face the prospect of virtual extinction now that only 12 per
cent of workers are organised.
As a result, an important debate has begun in the US over the future of
employee rights. As Richard Edwards asks: 'How can the employer's need for
flexibility in his operations be reconciled with workers' legitimate
aspirations for basic protections and fair dealing at work?' Present trends
suggest that the US is returning to the adversarial labour-management
relations that characterised much of the pre-New Deal workplace. The demand
for labour flexibility and reinforcement of the employment-at-will doctrine
may be understandable among employers who fear their position is being
undermined by free trade and deregulation on global markets.
But, as Edwards argues in his thoughtful book, autocratic management has
severe limitations when market pressures require companies to create and
retain 'highly motivated, loyal, hardworking employees'.
Is it really credible for companies to try to build up trust and security
with their employees, but also demand an unquestioned power to hire and fire
them?
The author suggests that collective bargaining is no longer a realistic
option in dealing with that conundrum, because 'unions today represent far
too few workers to serve as the centerpiece for workers' rights.' Apparently
'collective bargaining can no longer be regarded as the core institution for
a new regime of workers' rights'.
Nor does Edwards pin much faith in the statutory provision of workplace
rights as an alternative, arguing that there are severe limits on the
state's ability to legislate, and that legal regulation can be 'clumsy,
expensive and highly ineffective'.
Instead, he argues for the legal codification of what he calls 'enterprise
rights', the detailed guides provided by companies for their workers
individually that spell out their terms and conditions of employment.
The author believes employers must find a mutual interest with their workers
to ensure 'an effective, accepted and responsible system of industrial
governance'. Unless they recognise this, he argues, they must expect workers
to press hard for new federal government regulations to extend their
individual workplace rights to protect themselves against arbitrary
management.
By making 'employee handbooks legally enforceable', with access to
independent arbitration, Edwards believes he can create 'a new common
ground' where 'legitimate aspirations' contribute positively to 'employers'
competitive needs'.
But is this realistic? Edwards himself admits: 'Perhaps a majority of
American employers offer virtually no enterprise rights at all.' Such
so-called rights, where they do exist, are unilaterally provided by
companies so they can easily be abrogated when or if necessary.
It is hard to see why companies should agree to have their own employee
guides made legally enforceable, because it would restrain their unilateral
right to manage. Perhaps Edwards should have looked at ways of helping to
renew trade unionism as the answer to the genuine problem of workplace
rights.
Eileen Appelbaum and Rosemary Batt suggest in their highly informative
survey that corporate America - contrary to its adversarial image - may be
pragmatic enough to adapt to workplace change through co-operation rather
than conflict.
Certainly they found a surprisingly large number of US companies willing to
experiment with progressive forms of workplace organisation (total quality
management; just-in-time production; joint teamwork and the rest) than might
have been expected.
The authors estimate that a quarter to a third of firms 'have made
significant changes on how workers are managed' with serious quality-at-work
programmes. But their book also pinpoints 'obstacles to change' in the
American system, notably the 'lack of an institutional infrastructure'
ensuring that organisational innovation is 'overly dependent on the
personalities and commitments of key individuals.'
Moreover the 'ideological opposition' to job-security regulation makes it
'difficult for transformed firms, which rely on mutual trust, to honour
commitments they have made to employment security during periods of
recession.'
The authors point to successful employer-union partnerships (at Rank Xerox
with the Clothing and Textile Workers, and the Saturn project between
General Motors and the United Autoworkers for example) to suggest that
organised labour is not as anachronistic as many human-resource pundits
suggest.
Indeed, the implied but unfashionable conclusion from both books is that
collective bargaining and union workplace representation may not be such
obsolete concepts after all.
Perhaps American employers faced with the tidal force of global change
should question their instinctive dislike of trade unions. By sharing
responsibility in achieving growth and profitability with their workers
through collective representation, companies in many sectors may find
themselves better equipped to prosper on world markets than those that do
not.

The Marketing Casebook
by Sally Dibb and Lyndon Simkin
Routledge, Pounds 15.99 (paperback),
Pounds 30 (hardback)
270 pages
The case study has long played a central part in teaching at business
schools - indeed, Harvard does most of its MBA teaching through case
studies, and has invested heavily in recent years to update and
internationalise its material.
Producing topical, detailed and objective studies of organisations for
students to pick apart, discuss and learn from, is labour-intensive and
expensive. Ready-made case material, of the sort contained in The Marketing
Casebook, is likely, therefore, to be particularly welcome and well-used on
MBA and undergraduate marketing courses, as well as by individuals
attempting to get to grips with marketing issues.
The 15 case studies in the book cover a range of European companies,
including Euro Disney, Harris Queensway, Electrolux, Heineken, Kodak Norge,
and JCB. Each case contains a summary of issues for discussion and
cross-references to theory notes.
The notes, plus pointers to further reading, cover the usual marketing
course topics, including market research, segmentation, product management,
pricing, distribution, and international issues. An introduction provides
some guidance for students on how to tackle a case study and present
findings.
The Euro Disney study, for example, deals briefly with the revitalising of
Walt Disney's marketing worldwide since the mid 1980s, the expansion of its
theme parks and the move into Europe - followed by disappointing attendance,
local hostility and staff layoffs. Discussion points for students (and,
since the company's problems continue to unfold, no doubt for Disney
executives, too) include: 'What were Disney's US core marketing assets? How
applicable were they to its French base in Europe? What aspects of the
marketing environment did Disney ignore? How could it have researched
these?'
The Harris Queensway case study traces the success of the group's flagship,
the Queensway furniture retailing chain, during the 1980s and the events
that subsequently pulled the group down - the reduction in consumer
spending, a failure to keep up with retailing trends, and the unsuccessful
refocusing of the Times Furnishings and Queensway chains.
There was no full marketing research into consumer preferences and no
marketing department. When times got really tough, the study details how all
senior management in non-operational areas were immediately sacked,
including all marketing and planning executives. Issues raised for
discussion include: How could Harris have targeted additional market
segments? What were the main influences on consumer behaviour? How could
consumer needs have been researched? How could a new entrant best challenge
the market leader?
It is easier, arguably, to analyse and draw lessons from the experiences of
companies such as these, which are publicly acknowledged to have made
mistakes and misjudgements. More difficult is to present balanced evidence -
without the benefit of hindsight - of a company which currently seems to be
performing strongly. Some of the cases which fit this category are less
successful.
For example, the study of TGI Friday's, the restaurant chain which is owned
in the UK by Whitbread, reads rather more like a glowing testimonial from a
public relations company, than a cool academic appraisal.
Here are a couple of samples of the kind of prose that sits unhappily with
the more objective material in the book: 'Whether it is a simple coffee, an
unpronounceable cocktail, a bowl of chips or a five-course meal, TGI
Friday's will provide every customer or 'guest' with a truly memorable
experience.' 'Regular visitors to the Friday's talk about the Friday's
experience - a mix of buzzing atmosphere, flamboyant decor and friendly
staff, with a real will to please. . . The staff treat guests as if they
were valued visitors to their own homes. They are met at the door with a
warm welcome and accompanied to their table in a true Friday's frenetic,
good-humoured style.'

FT  15 MAR 94 / FT Review of Business Books (21): Financial magician's
stockpicking tricks fail to astonish - Jim Slater's latest book is an easy

to justify the cover price / Personal finance

Investment Made Easy: How to Make More of Your Money
By Jim Slater
Orion, Pounds 24.99
328 pages
Old figures from the 1970s are gradually being rehabilitated. Jimmy Carter
is now perceived as a well-intentioned soul, Abba songs are enjoying a
revival, even Richard Nixon is being granted elder statesmen status.
So perhaps it is unsurprising that Jim Slater is making a comeback. At one
time, his reputation as a financial whizzkid seemed irredeemably tarnished
by the collapse of the Slater Walker conglomerate in the mid-1970s.
Now he has a stock-tipping column in the Independent, and this is his second
investment book in two years. Indeed, Mr Slater, for whom the word chutzpah
might have been invented, has already devoted an entire Independent column
to plugging this book.
The good news is that his latest book is, by the standards of the genre, an
easy read. The bad news is that the information it contains scarcely seems
to justify the cover price. The first half is a trot through the highways
and byways of personal finance. This is fine as far as it goes, but can be
obtained better (and cheaper) elsewhere.
To be fair, what Slater has to say about endowment policies (he doesn't like
them) is very sensible. Perhaps a greater surprise to the newcomer is that
such a renowned stockpicker has so many kind words to say about
index-tracking funds. Nevertheless, one doubts whether many people will want
to pay Pounds 25 to receive his thoughts on such subjects.
I am sure the main appeal of a book from Slater is the belief that he has
the knack of picking wonder stocks. In this sense, his labyrinthine
wheelings and dealings in the 1970s, which prompted so much criticism at the
time, may just add to his appeal as a financial magician.
Such investors will turn to the second half of his book, headed 'More Active
Investment', for the section on shares. What they will find is a boiled down
version of Slater's previous book, the Zulu Principle (to which he makes
repeated references). Those who have read the earlier book - published for a
more modest Pounds 18.99 - will not need to read this again; Slater
enthusiasts are probably better off with the earlier tome.
Of course, one might argue that Pounds 25 is a snip if the reader can
discover the secret of successful stock market investment. But will they?
Slater's main enthusiasm is for growth shares - companies with a long record
of strong earnings growth. He emphasises the PEG, the relationship between a
share's prospective price-earnings ratio and the company's expected earnings
growth rate. The aim is to find companies with PEGs of less than 1 - that
is, where the expected growth rate is higher than the p/e.
Growth stocks can, of course, be highly profitable. The problem is that they
command a high price, and if their earnings disappoint, the fall in share
price can be both sharp and swift. Stock markets can be temporarily dazzled
by such companies, so relying on prospective p/es and forecasts for earnings
growth can be dangerously misleading.
Slater himself refers to the dangers. At one point he writes: 'During 1993,
after some painful investment experiences with shares like Sage and Micro
Focus, I decided to avoid investing in any further computer software
companies.' What he does not mention is that Sage received quite a lengthy
write-up in the Zulu Principle, and that both stocks were tipped in his
Independent column. Bad luck on those who followed his earlier advice.
Other stocks tipped by Slater may have done well. But as a quick test of his
methods, I looked at the performance of the six shares which would have been
picked out of the FT-A 350 Index in May 1993, on the basis of Slater's
criteria: Betterware, Inchcape, Rentokil, Rothmans, Tibbett &amp; Britten and
Wellcome.
While Slater says, 'I want to make it clear that I am not recommending the
purchase of any of these shares', this is largely because circumstances will
have changed between May 1993 and the time the reader buys the book.
Nevertheless, since he spends much space trumpeting the method, it seems
reasonable to ask how well those shares have performed since May. The answer
is, not very well. In the nine months between May 1 and February 1, 1994,
the six shares rose by an average 3.83 per cent (after allowing for some
tricky calculations on Rothmans); over the same period, the All-Share Index
was up by 25.6 per cent.
Of course, someone using Slater's methods today might easily produce a
portfolio of outperforming shares. The point is, not that formulaic
stock-picking methods cannot work, simply that they cannot work all the
time. So do not read Slater's books and columns for the stock tips, but for
the financial analysis they contain. And hope they publish a cheap
paperback.

FT  15 MAR 94 / FT Review of Business Books (20): Just round the S-curve -
The future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH

<TEXT>
Predictions
by Theodore Modis
Simon &amp; Schuster, Dollars 21
300 pages
What's the link between Aids deaths, road accidents, fruit-fly breeding and
the development of new computers?
According to Theodore Modis, all these phenomena can be understood better by
searching for patterns from the past. Modis spends much of the book looking
at 'S-curves' - the pattern by which growth in a specific variable starts
slowly, and gradually picks up before reaching a plateau.
He ranges across human and animal activity in picking out events where the
S-curve pattern seems to hold. Modis argues that by studying past patterns
we may be able to shed light on future events. According to this thesis,
Mozart died at a young but entirely appropriate age, at the point where his
creative juices had all but expired as shown by the S-curve of his major
compositions.
The writer attempts, with some success, to fit similar ideas to broader
areas of activity such as oil consumption or the development of rail
networks.
He melds into the S-curve view of life some fairly familiar discussion of
Kondratieff cycles, spiced with the variant that, according to Modis, the
boom/bust period of such cycles often lasts for precisely 56 years. On this
basis, the final 28-year phase of the current cycle is virtually upon us, as
a result of which the period between 1996 and 2024 will be a long economic
upswing.
While stimulating, the book has two main faults. Modis frequently gives the
impression that he is too smart for his own good. He switches a little too
easily between discussion of the growth behaviour of bacteria, building of
12th century cathedrals and the role of information technology.
One revelation, made in best clever-clogs style, but which seems wildly
implausible, is that the 56-year boom/bust cycle is related to the
construction of Stonehenge.
A more serious criticism is that Modis seems unsure who he is writing the
book for. Many economists and business planners may turn to the volume for
guidance as to how to improve their highly unsuccessful forecasting methods.
Although they may enjoy the read, they will get little practical advice.

Bartlett's Book of Business Quotations
Compiled by Barbara Ann Kipfer Little,
Brown, Pounds 9.99
266 pages
I have been poor and I have been rich,' says Sophie Tucker. 'Rich is
better.' Very sharp. Are there any more where that come from? Not many,
alas.
If it is true that 'Genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains' (Jane
Ellice Hopkins, 1870), this book is certainly not a work of genius. The
pains taken with Bartlett's Book of Business Quotations were strictly
finite.
It claims to give the date, when possible, of its quotes - but never
provides the year of the Shakespeare plays from which extracts are taken. It
tells us that the New Testament comes from the Bible - a fact with which we
may be familiar; but it does not hazard a guess as to the century when
Lao-tzu lived - even though it insists on passing on his highly dubious
remark that 'People are difficult to govern because they have too much
knowledge.'
'I cried all the way to the bank' is here credited to Liberace's 1973
autobiography, but was current well before that. Goethe may have added to
the quote which begins,'Art is long, life short'; but it was Hippocrates, of
Hippocratic-oath fame, who conceived it two millenia before. Disraeli may
have used 'Something would turn up' a little sooner, but surely it was
Dickens who bestowed it upon his Mr Micawber for all time.
'It is better to know some of the questions than all of the answers,'
appears here as an undated 'James Thurber Saying'. Why? In fact, he wrote
that, or something like it, in Fables for our Time. As for the publication
date, Bartlett's editor can look it up for herself. After all, 'Genius is
one per cent inspiration and ninety-nine per cent perspiration' (Thomas
Edison, 1932). And when she has finished perspiring over that, she can ask
herself why the two almost identical quotes about genius are dumped in
different sections of the book, the first under 'Entrepreneurship', the
second under 'Motivation'.
One quote, by Freud as it happens, consists only of the words 'To love and
to work'. As my children would ask, what's that got to do with the price of
fish?
We may well ask how the one thousand extracts came to be selected. The
answer seems to be that they were hived off from the 20,000 lying around in
a previous selection, Bartlett's Familiar Quotations. But they might as well
have called it 'Bartlett's Religious Quotations' or 'Sporting Quotes', so
irrelevant are they to industry, commerce, finance and, in most cases, to
anything.
Of course, they can be applied to business, but then so can 'Three Blind
Mice' if you push it. But do they pass the supreme literary test? Could a PR
department slip them into a speech written for a company chairman?
A few of the mots are genuinely bon. 'Beware of all enterprises that require
new clothes' (Thoreau) is a delight. So is Woody Allen's advice on getting
ahead: '80 per cent of success is showing up.' Mark Twain ('Cauliflower is
nothing but cabbage with a college education') shines out of a dull page.
Parkinson's Law about work expanding to fill the time available, which oddly
enough is related to business, remains true. There is also a wry truth in
John Ray's thought of 1670 that 'in a calm sea every man is a pilot' (just
wait for it to reappear in 'Bartlett's Book of Sailing') And a big hand to
Everett M. Dirksen for: 'A billion here, and billion there, and pretty soon
you're talking about real money.'
But that's about it. Henry James had some fine passages; the two extracts
here are not among them. As for Aristotle, some of whose unhelpful
pontifications are included, to my mind he passed his sell-by date in about
1494. You can quote me on that.

Scuttle your Ships Before Advancing, and other
lessons from history on leadership and chance
for today's managers
by Richard A Luecke
Oxford University Press, Pounds 14.95
240 pages
The use of great literature to shed light on business problems was exploited
by two American academics in The Classic Touch: Lessons in Leadership from
Homer to Hemingway, published by Dow Jones-Irwin in 1987.
But if art mirrors executive life, so managers who cannot remember the past
must be condemned to repeat it. That, at any rate, is the thesis of Richard
Luecke, a business writer who has entertainingly brought together a handful
of instructive historical episodes for those struggling to cope with late
20th century corporate change.
Hernan Cortes, the Spanish adventurer who penetrated the heart of the
powerful Aztec empire, is presented as the archetypal risk-taking
entrepreneur (he was so confident of success after landing in Mexico that he
scuttled his ships - hence the title of the book).
The Roman Emperor Hadrian and Louis X1 of France - the cunning 'Spider King'
of the late Middle Ages - are both shown to have been early exponents of the
art now known as 'management by wandering around' (MBWA). And the way in
which radical new ideas are only accepted when the time is ripe is explored
through the markedly different stories of the religious reformer Martin
Luther, and that recently deceased American missionary of industrial quality
W Edwards Deming.
At a time when many multinationals are trying to shake off any national
identity, perhaps the likes of ABB's chief executive Percy Barnevik can
learn something from the way the Roman Empire enlisted the allegiance of
different peoples and blended different cultures.
Perhaps the fiasco of the Battle of Midway - the second world war naval
encounter in the Pacific which, against the odds ended in a US victory over
the Japanese fleet - is a salutary tale of the unexpected and of the
limitations of strategic planning. And perhaps the career of Thomas
Hutchinson, of Massachusetts who represented the King's interests in the
colony before the American War of Independence, is a striking example of how
the leadership qualities that serve organisations well in one era are
sometimes inadequate to the challenges of another.
But historians, politicians, strategists and business people should beware
reading too much into the past; and Luecke has not always heeded advice
offered by a New York professor to 'let the history tell its own story' and
to keep the 'B-school' interpretation to a minimum. 'Like a 1970s-style CEO,
Trajan (Hadrian's predecessor) expanded the Roman conglomerate still
further' is the sort of sentence that for some readers will jar.
Luecke admittedly goes out of his way to stress the limitations as well as
the lessons of history. He quotes the ill-fated memorandum which compared
the situations facing the French in 1954 and the Americans in 1965, and
which influenced Lyndon Johnson's decision to send major US ground forces to
Vietnam. And he cites approvingly the historian Carl Gustavson's warning
that 'any statement in which the prefatory 'history teaches us that. . .'
used as a springboard should be very carefully scrutinised'.
History is helpful because it is full of people, experiences and challenges
with which we can identify today. It is surely appropriate, therefore, that
business leaders in this of all eras - faced with an unprecedented degree of
change and the task of guiding anxious and confused workers - should find
time to study the past as a means of understanding the present, and perhaps
as an inspiration for finding solutions for the future.
No society, though, should wish its business people to be too
backward-looking. History is littered with failure and disappointment, and
too close scrutiny of the statistically poor chances of, say, successfully
starting a new company or launching a new product might persuade tomorrow's
risk-takers to pack it in.

Problem People at Work
by Marilyn Wheeler
Century, Pounds 8.99
155 pages
Working it out at Work
by Julie Hay
Sherwood, Pounds 9.95
200 pages
Marilyn Wheeler had just been promoted. As she parked her car in the
management car park for the first time, she felt on top of the world.
The feeling did not survive her first meeting with the boss, who spoke
disdainfully to her from the other side of his big desk, making her feel she
was bound to fail.
Being a plucky girl, Marilyn did not let it get her down for long. She took
an assertiveness course, and, fresh from its lessons, marched into her
boss's office and told him that his oriental carpet and over-sized desk were
blatant power signals.
This exchange took place some years ago. Now the wicked male executive has
got rid of the offending carpet, and replaced the desk with a round table.
And as for Marilyn, she is living in California making a living writing
books telling people about how they, too, can deal with the problem people
in their lives.
In the old days, if someone was being difficult at work you fired them if
they happened to be your subordinate, and put up with them if they happened
to be your boss. These days you go on courses and read books to equip
yourself with winning strategies. The result is that the 'difficult people'
segment of the management publishing industry is booming.
'You've already taken the first step by buying this book]' says Wheeler in
the first chapter of Problem People at Work.
In the next, she reveals that the trick of dealing with impossible
colleagues is to remain in the 'Freedom State', as opposed to the 'Immature
State' or the 'Controlling State'. This is a fancy way of saying that it is
better to keep calm then to let yourself be crushed or to fly off the handle
 -advice which seems so obvious as to be scarcely worth saying.
The rest of the book takes each different variety of nightmarish behaviour
type by type. It catalogues real-life examples of insulters, time-wasters,
moaners, show-offs, bullies, blamers and so on, and for each supplies the
appropriate response.
Faced with someone who explodes, you should apparently avoid fighting words,
keep eye contact, use a strong voice. If your difficult person whines all
the time, you should ask them what they are going to do about their
problems, make them feel responsible (and therefore less likely to
complain). When dealing with the sort of person who always takes the credit,
you should be assertive, professional, blow your own trumpet, and above all
stay in the freedom state.
After treating you to 100 pages of other people's colleagues from hell,
Wheeler invites you to confront your own worst workmates. 'Take Action]' she
urges. Simply reading her book is not enough, she says: you must complete a
probing questionnaire about your difficult person, and about your responses
to them. She warns that you will never change your colleagues' characters,
but by thinking about the problem carefully, and by planning a strategy, you
will thwart them in their impossible ways.
Wheeler's old boss, with his big desk, has a lot to answer for.
Relationships in the office are just not as simple as she makes out.
Although one can recognise her stereotypes, they are of little practical use
to apply to real people. Coping with people in real offices calls for common
sense, sensitivity, and for a trial-and-error approach. Some of the advice
is reasonably sensible - but amid the exhortations and exclamation-marks
there is no room for subtlety, which is surely the key to getting yourself
out of hot water at work. Those who are inept in their dealings with others
should read this book at their peril. Its simplistic solutions may backfire]
As least Wheeler keeps much of the psycho-babble at bay, which is more than
can be said for Julie Hay. Hay, who was once upon a time an ordinary
employee, a trade unionist and subsequently a manager, has suffered a
wholesale conversion into the serious psychoanalytical world of
Transactional Analysis.
Working it out at Work is riddled with jargon and diagrams. 'The position of
mutual respect is summarised by IOKYOK,' she says at the outset. That is
short for I'm OK, you're OK, and it is TA's way of saying that two people
are getting along. Apparently, if either side is not OK, any number of
conclusions and diagrams can be deduced.
Then there are the different personal styles: we are all either adults,
parents or children - the classification depending not on our age or
offspring, but on our behaviour and emotions. This is only the beginning:
'controlling parent' must be distinguished from 'nurturing parent', and
'internal child' from 'adapted child'.
And will any of this make you better equipped to tell the boss you don't
like the size of his desk? Possibly, but by the time you had worked your way
through Hay's 'dream triangle', and fussed about the 'negative payoffs' and
the 'ulterior transactions', he might, with any luck, have retired.

A Study of the Privatisation of the Electricity Supply
Industry in England &amp; Wales
by Alex Henney
EEE Ltd, 38, Swains Lane, London N6 6QR, Pounds 400
389 pages
Give or take the odd flicker, the lights have stayed on in Laddingford.
In the broad sweep of civilisation, this may seem to be of trifling
consequence. But I have always regarded my domestic supply - based as it is
on electricity dribbling from the end of a rural supply line in Kent - as a
fairly accurate indicator of the health of the electricity supply industry.
When, prior to privatisation, the Central Electricity Generating Board
warned that the security of supply would be seriously impaired if generation
was separated from the national distribution grid, I stocked up with
candles.
And yet this proved to be just one of the many myths and weaknesses exposed
by the privatisation of the industry - one of the most complicated and
ambitious attempted by any Government.
The CEGB, for instance, claimed its system was 'the envy of the world', and
yet, as Alex Henney shows time and time again, the board was inefficient,
complacent and downright misleading when it came to presenting the true cost
of nuclear power.
The industry was producer-dominated, with the area electricity boards having
little influence over (or, one suspects, little understanding of) its
wholesale price, the bulk supply tariff.
Management was patchy and over-influenced by trade unions, while the
Electricity Council, the central co-ordinating body, was largely
ineffectual.
It must be said that there was little malevolence in all of this. The
managers and staff did their best; indeed, their dedication to public
service (demonstrated admirably in the aftermath of the 1987 hurricane) has
often been undervalued.
It was the basic structure of the industry that was wrong. It was also
highly politicised.
For all of its shortcomings, privatisation has produced a considerable
improvement on the original system. The industry is much more commercially
aware; power and influence has been transferred to where it should always
have been - the distributor, or regional electricity companies (RECs).
This commercialism, this desire for a quick return, has inevitably put
strains on other strategically-important energy industries, however. It has
given rise to the dash for gas in generation; it has accelerated the run
down of the coal industry, while opening the import gates to foreign (often
subsidised) coal. It has also put a question mark over the longer-term
future of the currently aided nuclear industry. The lack of an energy policy
is all too evident.
A former chairman of the London Electricity Consultative Council, Alex
Henney has been a long-time critic of the supply industry. In this study he
has provided a comprehensive analysis of the financial and operational
processes of privatisation. Given the complexity of the subject - and it did
take an army of 600 experts to plan the process - he is to be commended for
mastering the detail.
Where this book disappoints is in its lack of personality. Little is
recorded of the tensions and arguments that punctuated, and in part shaped,
the privatisation debate. Why was it, for instance, that Sir Philip Jones,
chairman of the Electricity Council, was sidelined from events, in spite of
his substantial Whitehall experience and propensity for grappling with
complex issues?
What of Lord Marshall, former chairman of the CEGB and the world's most
colourful and controversial exponent of nuclear energy? When, in 1989, the
government decided to exclude all nuclear reactors from privatisation he was
'invited to resign'. That is all we are told.
And then there were the chairmen of the area boards. They were far from
united in the privatisation debate, displaying varying degrees of commercial
acumen, personal ambition, retribution, and plain old-fashioned public
service.
Most of them are still in place, now as leaders of the privatised RECs (and
doing very nicely, thank you). Alex Henney is a consultant, advising - among
others - electricity companies, which might explain why he has steered well
clear of the more colourful personal issues. This is a pity, for it was the
personalities, not statisticians, who shaped the new electricity supply
industry with all its market strengths and imperfections.
Ray Dafter, former resources editor of the Financial Times, was a central
director of the Electricity Council from 1983 to 1988. He is currently
director of corporate affairs at Enterprise Oil.

FT  15 MAR 94 / FT Review of Business Books (15): 'The threat from
advertisers' - Raymond Snoddy discusses an academic's theory that private

pernicious 'censors' of newspaper content / Media

Advertising and a Democratic Press
by C. Edwin Baker
Princeton University Press, Dollars 24.95, Pounds 20
203 pages (incl 50pp of notes)
Critics of advertising usually point to its role in promoting an ultimately
unsustainable consumerist view of the world, or its potentially disruptive
impact in thrusting luxurious lifestyles under the noses of those who cannot
afford them.
Prof Edwin Baker has an even graver charge to level at the industry, at
least in the US: that it has destroyed diversity and competition in the
American press and, at least to a degree, debauched its standards. He
believes advertisers pose an even greater threat than politicians to press
freedom.
'Despite the potential danger and occasional occurrence of government
censorship, private entities in general and advertisers in particular
constitute the most consistent and the most pernicious 'censors' of media
content,' Prof Baker argues.
For the author, the most deadly case of advertiser influence was the mass
media's 'virtual silence' about the dangers of cigarette smoking, long after
these effects were well known to the medical community, to protect media
revenues from cigarette advertising.
The power of advertising can extend throughout the media conglomerates, such
as when a New York Times series on medical malpractice so upset
pharmaceutical companies that they threatened to withdraw 260 pages of
advertising from a medical magazine owned by the paper. Rather than buckle,
the New York Times sold the magazine.
However, the central thesis of the book is that advertisers have played a
fundamental role in destroying competition in the US newspaper industry. By
1989, only 26 US cities still had competing dailies.
This process of consolidation - which has, on the whole, produced a bland,
timid non-partisan press, according to Prof Baker - has largely resulted
from the fact that the largest paper in an area gets a disproportionate
amount of advertising. The increasing subsidisation of the cost of editorial
material leads to increasing dominance and the collapse of rivals. As rival
papers become uneconomic, overall circulations fall, because the survivors
do not acquire all the subscribers of the deceased titles.
Prof Baker believes that a commitment to democracy strongly supports the
treatment of media content as a 'merit good', to which all citizens should
have access, at least to some reasonable extent.
The author has one relatively simple suggestion to make to cure the problem.
To reduce the influence of advertising on newspapers, Prof Baker would place
a 10 per cent sales tax on newspaper advertising and redistribute the money
as a subsidy based on a paper's circulation revenue. This might reduce
advertising revenue by 10 per cent, but could increase revenues from
circulation by 30 per cent, rewarding newspapers that pleased their readers.
A similar process could apply to broadcasting. In 1989, for example, a 6 per
cent tax on television advertising would have provided Dollars 1.78bn to
fund public broadcasting.
Whether such an interventionist approach amounts to practical politics or
not, Advertising and a Democratic Press is an essential book for anyone
interested in the structural impact of advertising on American newspapers in
particular and the American media in general.
It is less clear how relevant such an analysis is for the British press.
Although advertising subsidises newspapers to a significant extent, a
reasonable diversity of views has survived, even though left-of-centre
opinions are considerably under-represented.
The relevance to Europe of Prof Baker's views cannot, however, be dismissed
entirely. He cites the well-known case of the Daily Herald. When it ceased
publication, it was read by 4.7m people, nearly twice as many as the Times,
FT and The Guardian added together. The problem was not a lack of readers,
but that the Herald's readers 'were disproportionately poor working-class,
and consequently did not constitute a valuable advertising market to reach'.
Ironically, a free marketeer like Rupert Murdoch appears to be moving in
Prof Baker's direction by cutting the price of The Times to 30p. By doing
so, he has based his main hope for the paper's future on increased
circulation revenues, by persuading more people to buy the paper, rather
than courting advertisers by offering a narrow elite readership.

FT  15 MAR 94 / FT Review of Business Books (12): Looser rules to encourage
new players - Andrew Adonis weighs the case, now being debated in the US,
for more competition in local telephony and an overhaul of the (woefully
inadequate) regulatory structure / US communications
</HEADLINE>

Toward Competition in Local Telephony
by William J Baumol and J Gregory
Sidak MIT Press, Dollars 27.50
169 pages
William Baumol and Gregory Sidak are in that happy league of advocates of
radical reform: they are on the winning side. At any rate, they are so for
more than half of their reform agenda, which is as much as one can hope for
in this life.
For the non-economist, their book is a tough read in parts, and much of the
regulatory and industry detail is less than vital to non-US readers. But
their essential argument consists of two propositions: that there is room
for more competition in local telephony; and that the current US regulatory
structure is woefully inadequate as a mechanism for promoting efficient
competition.
The first proposition is gaining increasing international acceptance. In the
US, competitive access providers have been growing fast, competing against
the local Bell companies to provide businesses with access to the
long-distance carriers. The regulatory structure looks set to loosen
further, with cable companies allowed to offer telephony services and vice
versa.
The speed of the change is remarkable, given America's history of
legislative sclerosis. Bills currently before Congress, and likely to pass
in some form, would repeal cable-telephone cross-ownership rules, although
they would still prohibit telephone companies from buying cable systems in
their own service areas. A separate bill would permit the local Bell
companies to compete with AT&amp;T and the other long-distance carriers.
To an extent, the US is following the UK's lead. Three years ago, the
government decided to break the pre-existing BT/Mercury duopoly and allow
new operators to build local cable telephone and television networks, while
banning BT from offering entertainment services over its own network for a
decade. Cable companies - mostly US-owned - are currently investing nearly
Pounds 5bn in building networks in conurbations which, by the end of the
century, will cover about half the country.
The Baby Bells are keen to take the lessons back home. However, it would be
rash to presume that the US telecoms map is going to be rewritten overnight,
even if the draft legislation is enacted.
The recent decision of Bell Atlantic to call off its Dollars 21.4bn merger
with Tele-Communications, the largest US cable television service company,
citing the 'unsettled regulatory climate', is a sign of the continuing
difficulties.
A particularly thorny issue is that of 'universal access' - or, as Al Gore
puts it, the imperative that there should not be 'information haves and have
nots'. As yet, there is no such concern in Britain, where the cable
companies are regarded as providing an additional, non-essential service to
their customers.
What does universal access mean? Special 'universal access' payments by
competitors offering new broadband services? Vouchers for the poor and/or
rural dwellers? If the latter, paid to whom and by whom? These are key
questions, which will need to be answered if the inter-active super-highways
are intended to provide 'universal service'.
Baumol and Sidak concentrate on a revised regulatory system to promote
competition. Essentially, for the (former) monopoly carriers, they want to
move away from rigid, service-by-service rate-of-return regulation to a
price cap applying to the average price of services in a basket - much as
does Oftel, the UK telecommunications regulator.
For new entrants competing against an existing operator whose network they
have to use to deliver their service, the authors want to see access prices
which include the 'opportunity cost' involved in the existing operator
losing market share to the new entrant.
They call this approach 'efficient component pricing'. It has the advantage,
they argue, of only admitting competition that is truly efficient, providing
real service improvements and/or price benefits to consumers. Furthermore,
they suggest, it reduces concerns about new entrants simply 'cream skimming'
the more lucrative parts of an operator's business.
The question, of course, is how to set the 'efficient component prices'. But
then, setting access charges under current regimes is a tough business -
witness the acrimonious disputes between telecoms competitors currently
taking place across the world. The principle is attractive. It deserves a
serious reception from the regulatory community, which more than anyone will
determine the shape of telecoms markets country by country over the next
decade.

Insanely Great: The Life and Times of Macintosh,
the Computer that Changed Everything
by Stephen Levy
Viking, Pounds 15
292 pages
I was counting the other day the number of computers I own. I think it is
about a dozen: at least two in the car, one in the CD player, the video
recorder, the washing machine; even the little portable radio. But only one
looks like a computer, staring back at me as I write: about the size of a
telephone directory, it opens up into the familiar keyboard and a 17cm flat
screen.
All the other computers in the house perform their tasks like a staff of
unobtrusive servants, making sure the water is just hot enough, that an
orchestra will play exactly when I require, and that my carriage will convey
me swift as imagination or . . . well, at 70 miles an hour, anyway. They are
so efficient that we have forgotten that they exist, and we certainly do not
care to have anything to do with them.
By contrast, the superior class of computers that take our letters, check
our spelling, keep our diaries, play games with us and verify our accounts
have become, in the last decade, important parts of our lives, in the
office, and recently at home too.
When personal computers first appeared, they were not much liked. They were
surly and slow; they would communicate only in a stilted and unnatural
language which required one to memorise codes; and if one gave a slightly
wrong instruction they would look completely blank, or answer back with the
insolent word: 'ERROR]'.
But a revolution has taken place; its significance is often not understood,
even by the millions who are discovering that computers have become friendly
(even obsequious), helpful, clever and fun. Screens are covered with little
pictures (Icons, in computerspeak). Mice, pushed around the table, shift a
pointer to the desired picture, and at the press of a button, a little world
of information or computer application, jumps into life in a 'window' on the
screen.
The revolution began in 1984, with the birth of the Apple Macintosh
computer, after a fraught conception and traumatic delivery at the company's
headquarters in Cupertino, California. It was an 'insanely great' idea, said
Steve Jobs, Apple's founder, who inspired and maddened his team of young
engineers. They wore tee-shirts and sneakers and were steeped in the
alternative culture of California of the 1970s. Their mission was no less
than to topple International Business Machines from its dominance of the
personal computer market, by producing a machine, no longer an alien
processor of digits, but an extension of human intellect and creativity.
They failed. The first Apple Mac, introduced to the world with a fanfare of
aspiration, was flawed by inadequate power, some rickety programming and
Jobs's misreading of the market. The team that expected to change the world
collapsed in exhaustion and despair, and then dispersed. Jobs left Apple,
and John Sculley, an apparently more conventional manager whom Jobs had
enticed from Pepsi-Cola, took complete charge.
Slowly, the fortunes of the Mac improved. It found an important niche in the
publishing world, and remains the only significant rival to IBM in personal
computing. But the real revolution is that the Mac personality, based on
menus, mice and icons has been cloned in the IBM world.
Stephen Levy, a computer journalist, tells this story with lively
intelligence, pace and a good dose of personal anecdote. Although a
committed believer in the Macintosh vision, he does not mind exposing its
faults, and gives a lively picture of the mismanagement and extraordinary
pockets of anarchy which flawed Apple for some of this period. He also
offers a well observed portrait of Jobs, who emerges as 'insanely great',
rude, arrogant, self-absorbed and sometimes fatally inattentive to detail or
the work of others.
Yet Jobs was also as a kind of prophet. He absorbed and implemented a vision
of the machine as a true servant of the human intellect, an idea proposed as
far back as 1945 by Vannevar Bush, a former vice-president of the
Massachussetts Institute of Technology.
This historical context enables Levy to project the recent revolution in
personal computing into the future, without degenerating into science
fiction. If we can now point at pictures and trace connections between
millions of words, images and figures stored in a friendly gadget, how long
will it be before we talk to it and accept as perfectly natural that it will
answer back? Will computers really become part of our psyche?
Those who doubt it will find this an interesting story, well written in the
American journalist's style and refreshingly free from jargon.

FT  15 MAR 94 / FT Review of Business Books (11): Does Britain need the
German model? - The financial systems are different, says Geoffrey Owen. But
the link between the difference and industrial performance is less certain /
Corporate governance

Keeping Good Company: a study of corporate governance in five countries
by Jonathan Charkham.
Oxford University Press, Pounds 19.95.
389 pages
Banks, Finance and Investment in Germany
by Jeremy Edwards and Klaus Fischer
Cambridge University Press, Pounds 30.
252 pages
German industrial companies are widely believed to have a competitive
advantage over their British counterparts, because they are less subject to
short-term pressures from the stock market, are less vulnerable to the
threat of takeover and enjoy more constructive, long-term relationships with
their banks and shareholders.
It is partly for these reasons that Jonathan Charkham, in his study of
corporate governance in five countries, concludes not only that Germany is
the best, but that Britain's industrial decline will continue unless it
moves closer to the German model.
That the German financial system is different from the British one is clear.
Much less certain is the link between that difference and the industrial
performance of the two countries.
Too many assertions on this topic are based on misleading or partial
accounts of how the German system works. Thus a useful complement to
Charkham's book is this careful study by Edwards and Fischer, of the role of
German banks in supplying funds to companies and in monitoring their
management.
Germany has fewer publicly quoted companies than Britain, and within this
small group only a minority have widely dispersed shareholdings on the
Anglo-American pattern. Most of them have a dominant shareholder with at
least 25 per cent of the equity; this is usually a non-financial enterprise
rather than a bank.
This structure has several implications.
First, owner-managed firms account for a much larger proportion of German
industrial output than is the case in Britain. The small and medium-sized
unquoted companies which dominate much of German industry have little
relevance to Britain's corporate governance debate, which is mainly
concerned with the gulf between managers and shareholders. Most of these
companies fall below the threshold at which supervisory boards are required.
The idea that bank representation on supervisory boards is important for
German competitiveness must be qualified by the fact that firms with this
structure account for no more than 30 per cent of total turnover in the
German economy.
Second, Edwards and Fischer cast doubt on the view that, in the large quoted
companies, the presence of banks on supervisory boards confers advantages in
the provision of long-term finance and in the early detection of financial
stress or managerial failure.
There is no evidence that banks which are represented on boards of companies
make more long-term loans to those companies. Strong competition within the
banking industry, including the savings banks and the co-operative sector,
limits the scope for exclusive relationships; the 'house bank' in a large
firm is typically no more than first among equals in a group of several
banks.
To the extent that banks become aware of impending financial strains, it is
in their role as lenders, not as board members.
Most banks loans are secured by collateral, which reduces the banks'
incentive to intervene in troubled companies to stave off bankruptcy.
Interviews conducted by the authors suggest that, unlike Japanese banks,
'German banks do not in general get directly involved in the reorganisation
of a firm in financial distress and do not possess any personnel who are
specialists at turning unprofitable firms around.' In the case of large
quoted companies, the authors concede, board membership may have 'some
limited positive effect' in encouraging them to intervene, because their
reputation is at stake.
The third distinctive feature of the German system is more relevant to the
corporate governance issue. Where a shareholder has a stake of 25 per cent
or more in a company, it has a greater incentive to monitor management than
the typical British or American institution, whose shareholdings rarely
exceed 1-2 per cent. In addition, the presence of large, semi-permanent
investors makes hostile takeovers difficult if not impossible.
The holders of these large stakes are often suppliers or customers of the
company concerned. The shareholding is seen as part of a set of 'implicit
contracts' which encourages long-term, high-trust relationships between the
two parties. There is stability and commitment - missing in most British
companies.
Does this network of share stakes work to the benefit of all shareholders
and of the German economy as a whole? Edwards and Fischer point out that
some of the companies (including the three big banks), which hold large
stakes in other companies, do not themselves have a dominant shareholder;
they are among the minority of cases where shareholdings are widely
dispersed. It is not obvious that the managers of these companies, not
subject to monitoring by their own shareholders, have a strong incentive to
monitor their fellow-managers in the companies where they hold shares.
Indeed, there is a risk of managerial collusion, to the detriment of both
sets of shareholders. 'Representation of firms on each other's supervisory
boards, and in particular the extensive networks among firms which are
created by common bank supervisory board representation, may allow cartel
arrangements to be made, so that profitability increases for reasons
unrelated to efficiency improvement.'
That the system limits the scope for hostile takeovers may be an advantage.
But it is arguable that the absence of the take-over threat has allowed some
German companies to pursue expansionist ambitions which have been damaging
to their own shareholders and of questionable benefit to the economy. If
British and American companies are too quick to dispose of temporarily
loss-making businesses, the Germans sometimes hold on to them for too long.
Charkham accepts that the German system has a tendency towards rigidity, but
in his view it has a huge advantage over Britain in providing a stable
framework within which managers can take long-term decisions. On balance, he
thinks, the fear of takeover is 'distracting, destructive and inhibiting.'
The need for hostile takeovers would be reduced if investors were more
committed to companies and more active in overseeing their performance.
The necessary moves in this direction, Charkham argues, will not occur
without government intervention. The first step would be the creation of a
Royal Commission which would, among other things, reconsider 'the role and
effects of hostile takeovers.'
Yet Charkham provides no evidence that Britain's industrial decline, a
central theme in the book, is linked to weaknesses in corporate governance.
He notes, for example, that Britain is not represented 'among the major
players in the electronics and computer industries.' But in these two
sectors the short-termist US, with all its failings in corporate governance,
is far stronger than long-termist Germany. Success in electronics has little
to do with the presence or absence of hostile takeovers.
Charkham is on stronger ground in calling for improvements in the
composition and conduct of boards of directors. The process by which
non-executive directors are appointed, and the functions which they are
expected to fulfil, remains one of the least satisfactory features of the
British system.
The other four systems which Charkham describes - those of Germany, France,
Japan and the US - all have their flaws, but he thinks the British system is
more flawed than most. He comments approvingly that in Japan there is a
consensus that 'the shareholders' interest does not have to be satisfied by
a growing dividend stream . . . shareholders' interests may be pushed to the
back of the queue.' This reflects a Japanese concept of what companies are
for, which is very different from Anglo-American attitudes. But whether the
supposed downgrading of shareholders is a central ingredient in Japanese
economic success is another matter.
None of the five countries has found a perfect solution to the corporate
governance problem. Just as the Japanese and German system of interlocking
share stakes has potential costs as well as benefits, the same is true of
Britain's reliance on takeovers and an active stock market. No doubt there
are many things wrong with the management of British companies, but there is
no compelling evidence that the pressure on them to maximise shareholder
value is a competitive disadvantage.

FT  15 MAR 94 / FT Review of Business Books (10): Out of the spare room - In
profile: two publishers of business books
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GAY FIRTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Michael Becket, man-of-all-work at Flame Books, publishes business books on
a scale not so much small as tiny. He likes it that way.
'Mind you, it's jolly hard work doing absolutely everything yourself.
Especially running round the bookshops, selling. If you see a man with a
satchel full of books, complaining about his hernia, he's a small
publisher.'
In real life (which is to say, full-time profession) Mr Becket is the Daily
Telegraph's City news editor. He slots Flame Books into the category of
serious fun.
'I'm hard-nosed: you've got to be. Of the six books I've published, only one
has lost serious money. That was when I fell victim to Publishers' Disease.'
He says it in capital letters. 'Publishers' Disease is the book you think
ought to be published. That's where a small publisher can go badly wrong -
that, and the problem of working capital.'
Mr Becket argues that the time-gap between commissioning a book and actually
getting it into bookshops is the reason why the publishing industry is more
capital-intensive than it needs to be. Into that gap fall authors' advances,
editing and design costs, printers' charges (paper, printing and binding),
warehousing, sales reps, overheads - the bureaucracy of publishing. Nine
months is shorter than full term for the birth of a book. Michael Becket,
running his imprint out of his spare bedroom, laughs scornfully.
'I once got a book into bookshops a fortnight after the Budget, with the
Budget changes already in it. Why not? Flame Books is a microcosm of the
industry as a whole. Anyone can publish a book quickly.'
Most publishers, he says, think they are selling to readers. 'They're not -
they're selling to bookshop book buyers.' He runs through sales patter:
''This is the book you want.' 'You the rep?' 'I'm the chairman. This is the
book you want'.'
His signal success, How the Stock Exchange Works, has sold about 60,000
copies in editions updated every two years or so. Economic Alphabet, a
glossary of financial and business terms, launched on the back of the Daily
Telegraph's Money-Go-Round feature, has sold nearly 30,000.
'One day I was writing about sterling M3 without being quite sure what it
meant. So I phoned the Bank of England and got a definition. Then I wasn't
sure exactly what a discount house was - and when I checked it out with City
folk their answers ranged from 'er' to 'um'. Hence the book.'
The effort is in selling, distribution, and fighting for prime space on
bookshop shelves.
'For Flame Books it's still touch and go.'

Nicholas Brealey knows all about the anguish of starting a small business.
Just a day after his first five titles had been delivered to the warehouse,
the company which printed them went bust.
'I had no credit status at the time and had had to put money up front,' he
recalls with due humility. 'If the receivership had been 48 hours earlier I
would probably have abandoned the whole venture. As it happened, in all the
chaos they forgot to send me the invoice, so what was a potential nightmare
turned into a valuable lesson in cash flow.'
Two years later Nicholas Brealey Publishing has carved out a profitable and
instructive niche in the business book publishing world. The company now has
some 40 or so titles on its list, including Lester Thurow's Head to Head,
Fons Trompenaars' Riding the Waves of Culture, and one of last year's big
international successes Re-engineering the Corporation, by Michael Hammer &amp;
James Champy.
It is about to publish Global Paradox, by John Naisbitt (author of
Megatrends) and Robert Waterman's Frontiers of Excellence. On the back of
tripled turnover in 1993 and optimism about the outlook for the year ahead,
Brealey has just hired two new people and moved to new offices in London's
Bloomsbury Square.
The venture is by no means the only small independent publishing house to
have tasted success recently. But Brealey bridles at the cottage-industry
image of tatty amateur. On the contrary, he believes that in a global world
apparently dominated by the big multinational houses, there is every
opportunity for small, focused operators like himself to reach the
bestseller list.
Partly this is because of what he sees as the 'diseconomies of scale' in
many people based businesses. 'If I was in a multinational I would be in
meetings all day trying to persuade others to publish books rather than just
getting on with the job,' is how he puts it.
There is also the question of whether the much trumpeted international
synergies actually work. The Re-engineering book and Daniel Yergin's Russia
2010 are examples of books published in the US by multinationals  - but by
Brealey rather than their local offshoots in Europe.
'Many consumer publishing companies have massively cut back on their lists
to the extent that they are really only interested in potential top-10
winners,' suggests Brealey, who worked for several big houses himself before
creating NB through a buy-out from the Industrial Society. 'It just happens
that business books in this country are not seen in this category.'
Arguably, the trend towards outsourcing has also helped a new player. All
the 'heavy stuff', such as invoicing, credit management, warehousing and
distribution, is sub-contracted out: 'Almost everything except the editorial
policy and marketing - which is what I think a publisher should be,'
Nicholas Brealey adds.

The Provincial Insurance Company 1903-38: Family, Markets and
Competitive Growth
by Oliver Westall
Manchester University Press, Pounds 40
465 pages
On one level, this book is an intriguing tale of entrepreneurial success,
featuring, among others, John Maynard Keynes and his largely successful
record as a fund manager in the 1920s and 1930s.
On another, it provides evidence to challenge orthodox assumptions about the
'competitiveness' and other perceived strengths of the British insurance
industry.
Westall, a business historian at Lancaster University, was commissioned to
write the early history of the Provincial Insurance Company, a small
family-owned concern which ranks among the UK's top 20 insurance companies.
The company still sticks doggedly to its independence, an attitude which
becomes less surprising when the measure of its early achievements is
understood.
The origins of the Provincial were not auspicious. The company's founder,
James Scott, a Bolton cotton magnate, chose an insurance company in
preference to investing in a local bleach factory.
The decision was motivated, in part at least, because it allowed Scott's two
sons and heirs to live in the Lake District, and was greeted with some
scepticism by the insurance establishment. Moreover, as Westall tellingly
describes, the Provincial emerged in a market dominated by a cartel of
powerful insurance companies.
By the beginning of this century, the biggest companies had built up an
elaborate and effective cartel, based on the tariff - an agreed minimum
price for insurance premiums.
The formation of the fire offices committee in 1868 had allowed systematic
rate regulation in fire insurance to become 'formal and explicit', and over
the next 30 years 'a formidable system of market control was consolidated,'
writes Westall.
'By 1903 an array of committees, served by a professional staff, controlled
73 tariffs covering virtually every class of fire insurance, specifying in
detail the form policies should take and the minimum premium rates to be
charged for every aspect of risk.
'The development was of the greatest importance,' he continues. 'If the fire
offices committee could prevent rate competition, it would remove the most
effective solvent of the bonds of goodwill which protected established
companies from competitors trying to build up new market share.'
The achievement of James Scott and his sons Samuel and Francis was to break
into this market. One important tactic was the ability to set premiums at
rates lower than those demanded by the tariff companies. However, the
success of this tactic seems to have depended on three separate elements.
The Provincial took an innovative approach to distribution, which allowed it
to reduce its expense base; while the tariff companies sold insurance
through an extensive network of agents, serviced by a wide and ultimately
costly network of branch offices, by contrast. Provincial built up its
connections with independent insurance brokers (the forerunners of today's
commercial brokers) - such as the Bains (in Leeds) - who were prepared to
deal with a number of separate companies.
The company was relatively quick to take advantage of opportunities to
launch new products, which emerged with some frequency amid rapid
technological and social change. Initially specialising in fire insurance
for Lancashire mill-owners, Provincial broke into the accident market which
emerged after the introduction of compulsory workers' compensation insurance
in 1906, for example. This was 'a buoyant business, free of traditional
links. This allowed less well-established companies to use rate competition
to grow with the market.'
After the first world war, Provincial focused much of its attention on the
motor insurance market, which was an important new source of income for
other non-tariff insurers such as Eagle Star, Cornhill, General Accident and
Lloyd's of London. Provincial built up its share of the motor market by a
selective underwriting strategy. Its offer of a 'country discount' to
motorists driving bigger cars and living in rural areas was not copied by
more established competitors, allowing the Provincial both to increase its
market share by a rate disproportionate to its size and to make profits.
Finally, Samuel and Francis Scott took an adventurous approach to investment
strategy. One of two insurance companies advised by Keynes, the Provincial
invested more than 30 per cent of its funds in the equity markets at a time
when most of its competitors favoured safer government bonds and loans and
mortgages. As a result, Provincial earned above-average investment income,
and stole a significant march on its competitors, who, on the whole, did not
adopt this approach until the 1950s and 1960s.
'Despite the extraordinary changes in the investment environment during the
inter-war years, most insurance investment continued to reflect late
nineteenth century conventions,' says Westall.
By 1938 the Provincial had become a significant 'competitive element' in the
UK market, and was making significant profits. The family's original
investment of Pounds 75,000 was worth Pounds 2.5m by 1938, an increase in
value of about 20 times in real terms. There the story ends, although a
second volume bringing the history up to date is apparently on the cards.
Meanwhile, Westall's analysis of the industry cartel, its disintegration in
the 1960s and 1970s, tariff system and the inefficiencies it may have
shielded, demands further and wider development. All the more so, bearing in
mind the complex challenges that the industry now faces.

The History of the British Petroleum Company Vol. II,
The Anglo-Iranian Years, 1928-54
by J H Bamburg
Cambridge University Press, Pounds 50
639 pages
The subject matter of this book is one of the most gripping stories in 20th
century British business.
It tells how Anglo-Iranian Petroleum, which had made the first commercial
oil discovery in the Middle East in 1908 and six years later fallen under
majority control of the British government when it ran short of capital,
then became, in the 1930s, a leading member of the international oil
industry, before its dramatic nationalisation by the Iranian government in
1951.
The last page of the book contains a photograph, taken in December 1954,
showing two workmen replacing the Anglo-Iranian plaque outside Britannic
House in Finsbury Square, London, with one reading: 'The British Petroleum
Company Limited.' Truly, the formative period of a great British company had
occurred.
During the years covered by this volume, Anglo-Iranian was Britain's largest
single overseas investment and its fortunes a matter for concern at the
highest level in Washington as well as London. It thus found itself in the
crosswinds of competing geopolitical interests: located alongside Britain's
imperial passage to India, Anglo-Iranian was a crucial supplier of fuel to
the British armed forces in two world wars.
For Washington, the undisputed priority by the early mid-1940s was the
preservation of a friendly regime in a country whose northern borders adjoin
the Soviet Union. From a management point of view, it was an explosive
political blend.
The dominant figure at Anglo-Iranian in the earlier part of this period was
Sir John, later Lord, Cadman, who was chairman from 1927 to 1941. Cadman, a
professor of mining turned Whitehall technology adviser, was
international-minded, gregarious and an easy member of Britain's ruling
class.
His successor, William Fraser, started out in his father's Scottish shale
oil company, organised the transfer of that industry to Anglo and became
Cadman's managing director in 1929 at the age of 35. As chairman from 1941
to 1956, this 'autocratic, abrasive and uncompromising' Scot was regarded by
civil servants as a dangerous liability to their delicate diplomatic efforts
in Teheran and Washington.
Dr Bamburg, who has become BP's in-house historian since the first volume in
this series was published in 1982, grants Fraser a somewhat better press
than in some other accounts - although he agrees that the company 'could ill
afford any shortcomings' in the area of international relations and links
with government in a period of such acute political turbulence. Against this
he suggests that, as Cadman's managing director, Fraser was responsible for
running and developing the business whilst Cadman politicked at full
throttle.
Fraser also shared with Cadman a commitment to technological advance and to
financial caution, the latter of which has not always been a quality typical
of the oil industry, or even of British Petroleum.
Among the managerial lessons of a story told here with abundant detail but
insufficient colour, narrative drive and thematic focus, is that a good
managing director does not necessarily make the right chairman and that a
top executive who attains great heights at an early age needs to be watched,
lest he be content for an undemanding board to grow old with him. There was,
the author notes, 'a creeping movement towards gerontocracy.'
It is also evident that from its earliest days, Anglo-Iranian's top
management failed to delegate clearly to those nominally running its crucial
Persian activities. Perhaps this was a function of the company's excessively
narrow focus on production and refining in Iran. That can only be partly
excused by the political pressure it felt from Teheran to pump up oil
volumes and revenues in a period which, like the present, was characterised
by global over-supply and abortive attempts to erect pricing and marketing
cartels.
This failure in strategic thinking in the pre-war years was thus reinforced
by an unsatisfactory managerial structure and perhaps reflected also in a
lack of invention and drive on the marketing side of BP, where executives
tended to look for the nearest shared distribution deal, rather than
attacking the market with determination and originality.
Meanwhile, BP's handsomely profitable business created few incentives to
attack the bureaucracy which was spreading its tentacles in London. Some
will find the most enjoyable page in this book a memorandum from an external
consultant, on the daily pattern within one 'grossly overstaffed' section of
the company.
At 3.15 pm, this report noted, 'again an air of relaxation became apparent
as tea and cake were expected. After tea there was a general feeling that
the back of the day's work was broken and clerks felt themselves at liberty
to read, crochet, make out menu cards, draw or gossip.' Subsequent reforms,
the author writes, 'had little impact on the overall shape of the managerial
structure.'
The drama of nationalisation, however, like all corporate crises, brought
its benefits. Anglo was forced to look beyond Iran for supplies and to
broaden its planning horizon. By the time the plaque was changed in Finsbury
Circus, British Petroleum was a much-changed company, although its struggle
for regional balance and a more flexible culture has continued to the
present day.

FT  15 MAR 94 / FT Review of Business Books (6): An academic manque - John
Plender discovers how Jack Rose read the property cycle better than most
developers / Autobiography

Square Feet
by Jack Rose
RICS Books, Pounds 9.95
169 pages
Few people are less like the conventional stereotype of the millionaire
property entrepreneur than Jack Rose.
While others of his kind took elocution and dreamed of shooting pheasants on
a country estate, Rose was busy rewriting the property industry's leasehold
valuation tables. When his company, Land Investors, had become one of
Britain's better known quoted property concerns, his idea of a good time was
to go out for an Indian or Chinese meal with his wife.
In an age when the fortunes of property developers have largely been
dictated by the ebb and flow of bank credit, this academic manque, who never
took any professional exams, read the property industry cycle better than
most.
Above all, Jack and his younger brother Philip, who died in 1977, were
famously risk-averse. Having graduated from estate agency into development,
they allowed partners, including such well known property men as Harry
Hyams, Felix Fenston and Stanislas Radziwill, to take all the financial
risk. Jack Rose was the detail man, who brought meticulous professionalism
to the task of acquiring and undertaking developments. Only when he had
established a secure financial base through a host of partnership deals was
he prepared to take on the full risk of development.
The Rose brothers' good fortune was to have gone into property in time to
exploit the opportunities thrown up by post-war reconstruction. In the
period of cheap money in the 1950s and 1960s, it was possible to raise an
office block in the knowledge that the cost of acquisition and construction
could be recouped from a long-term mortgage debenture when the development
was completed and let. The rent on the building would cover the cost of
servicing the debenture from the outset. As long as demand for space
remained strong, and the planners perpetuated the shortage of supply created
by the Luftwaffe, people with drive and market knowledge had a unique
opportunity to become rich.
This did not prevent them from cutting corners, as this autobiography makes
engagingly clear. Rose's first employer built his country house estate
agency business by ruthlessly poaching other firms' clients. When Jack and
Philip Rose set up their own estate agency they were forever putting up 'To
Let' boards outside property without permission from the owner, in the
knowledge that the boards would stand for a potentially lucrative month or
so before being removed.
'At one time,' Rose recalls, 'anyone boarding a number 14 bus at Marble Arch
and sitting on the top deck might well have thought that Jack Rose &amp; Co
owned most of Oxford Street'.
The picture that emerges of the estate agency business is unflattering and
wholly convincing. The tale becomes even more picaresque when the Roses
advance to development. As a landlord, Jack was not past breaking and
entering premises at the weekend where the office tenants had legitimately
refused him entry. A friendly builder would then discreetly carry out
improvements that were needed to make the building saleable to an
institutional investor.
Nor is the book reticent about the racy behaviour of others. Rose was at
school with the late Felix Fenston, a developer who did acquire a country
estate and social graces. Fenston's grander friends might well have been
surprised by Rose's tale of how Fenston cynically defrauded one of their
earliest employers. Had these revelations appeared in a book by an
investigative journalist, they would probably have been noisily serialised
in a Sunday paper and caused a dreadful fracas.
There are not many prominent property people with whom Jack Rose did not
have dealings. Yet it is characteristic of the man that he offers little in
the way of anecdotes about legendary figures like Cotton and Clore, and
prefers instead to tell of Sam Champagne, a multi-millionaire cabbie who
lived alone in a small flat and continued to drive his taxi to the end of
his days, sometimes taking fares from people he took to inspect his
property.
Yet Rose, the philanthropist and boffin-cum-entrepreneur, has his silences
and his quirks. Despite professing a love of painting and the arts, he says
little in this book about the appearance of the buildings that he developed;
the photographs suggest that there was plenty to be reticent about. Though
no respecter of conventional wisdom, he is surprisingly respectful both of
the City and the property establishment, and delights in his recent
membership of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
More endearing is his pleasure at having fulfilled his academic ambition by
winning a Master of Philosophy's degree from Reading University for a thesis
on property.
Interestingly, he expresses no regret that his company was driven into
receivership within four years of his selling out in 1986 - though he does
mildly regret having sold before the market peak.
Had Jack Rose been born in the Potteries, instead of a pub in London's
Hoxton, it would have been tempting to detect an echo here of Arnold
Bennett's novel The Card. As it is, the book contains plenty of nuggets
about a fascinating, highly individualistic industry, as well as a revealing
picture of the London in which the author spent his childhood. The man
shines through, even - perhaps especially - when the prose betrays the
occasional lack of polish.

Japanese Business Etiquette
by Diana Rowland
Warner Books, Pounds 5.99
354 pages
There is something deeply annoying about books on Japanese business
etiquette.
It is not that they do not deliver important and useful information. Diana
Rowland gives us a great deal, about post office opening times and seating
positions at meetings, etiquette at public baths and how to eat sushi.
Nor is it that many such books do not ring true. Diana Rowland's
descriptions of the acute embarassment which non-Japanese can cause by, for
instance, adopting too direct an approach to an initial meeting with a
company or making a show of paying for a meal, ring true.
No, the annoying thing is that many books obfuscate as they clarify. By
turning Japan into the sort of place where people need special guides and
inside knowledge, they make it seem a lot more intimidating than it really
is.
The truth, as Rowland points out, is that etiquette is a small part of what
brings success. What count are either traditional virtues, which hold good
anywhere; or special qualities, such as being an insider within a web of
Japanese relationships - which is beyond the grasp of most foreigners.
Nevertheless, as these guides go, Diana Rowland's is readable, practical,
useful and accurate.

China: the Next Economic Superpower
by William H Overholt
Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 18.99
293 pages
China is indeed shaping up to be the next economic superpower. Its
remarkable success is easily visible to any visitor. Yet even after 15 years
of open-door policies, the country's inner workings remain so well cloaked
that it is a challenge for anybody seeking to chronicle its progress.
Mr Overholt, then, is a brave man. A senior executive in Hong Kong with
Bankers Trust, the US bank, he has observed Asia's development at close
hand. He is not coy about emphasising, in a five-page author's note, his
qualifications. Apparently he was well in the vanguard in seeing the
beneficial effects of the Asian way of promoting economic growth before
political freedom. He also played a 'central but quiet role' in the 1986
Philippine revolution.
Confreres beside whom he stood quietly at the barricades in Manila might be
surprised to find him arguing that democratically-run third world countries
don't have what it takes to forge economic success. Adopting democracy
before economic reform, he writes, has 'virtually always led to economic
strains so severe as to cause economic collapse, more often than not
followed by a reversion to dictatorship.'
Mr Overholt styles himself as a lone western voice against western demands
for all-out and immediate political change in China. This position draws him
into sweeping generalisations in support of the Chinese or 'Asian' way,
often belied by the evidence which he supplies in more sober moments.
Sketching the compelling story of China's growth, he is alert to the
problems which may undermine success, such as poor infrastructure,
bureaucracy, lack of a legal system, burdensome state industries, fractious
provinces and uncertain future leadership. Chinese officials might admit
that the process has been more experimental than the controlled sequence
suggested by Mr Overholt. Reform has moved ahead since this book was
completed.
The author tends to take Chinese statements too much at face value, and
approaches fervour when his twin enthusiasms for China and stock and bond
markets are combined. But he is also alive to the ironies and contradictions
which follow from the grant of economic freedom to a people still ruled by a
totalitarian propaganda machine: for example, that Communist party
secretaries who used to run companies, now by-passed, often find themselves
ensuring capitalist policies of foreign venture partners are followed by the
workers.
Nor can the central element of his thesis be denied. Clearly, Deng
Xiaoping's policy of opening up the economy before the political system has
proved a great deal more successful than Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika.
Not only are Mr Deng and his party still at the helm, but the whole country
is better off - even if the divide between rich and poor provinces has
widened. Meanwhile, Russia sinks deeper into dissension and economic chaos.
However, to observe that the 'Asian' model - economic freedom now, political
liberalisation later - has been successful in countries such as South Korea,
Taiwan and Singapore is safer than to argue that this is the way in which
countries like China should proceed. Each, after all, starts from a
different set of circumstances.
Asians who have for no reason suffered the tap on the door in the middle of
the night, incarceration, torture or worse might ask why their freedom was
incompatible with their country's economic progress. They probably wanted
prosperity, too. The case that political liberalisation is inappropriate for
third world economic success, and therefore that authoritarian regimes are
appropriate, is hardly self-evident.
Mr Overholt argues that the need to win re-election will always undermine
reform policies which involve economic sacrifice, and that reforms need time
to mature without intervention by 'uneducated' voters. Yet a prime
motivation for Mr Deng's reforms was the Communists' recognition of the need
to win a popular mandate to remain in power by reversing ideological
principles which had led them to perpetrate a series of disasters on their
people.
To observe that economic reform eventually produces political change - so
that's all right then - is to admit that pressures for change have been
resisted all along, and finally cannot be denied by politicians and
bureaucrats who have been determined to hang on to power. It is all very
well to assert that Asian countries are different from western ones and
operate by 'consensus'. Economic reforms do take a long time.
Westminster-style democracy may indeed not be the best option. But in the
end, the degree of consensus which a government has built behind its
policies can only really be tested at the ballot box.
The first priority of such governments certainly should be to get their
economic policies right, and China is making a good stab at it. Mr Overholt,
too, should concentrate on the economics and the finance. The politics are
better left to others. The latter parts of his book sadly lose coherence -
especially when he allows the bees in his bonnet to buzz about Hong Kong -
though he ends with a sound discussion of why it is in America's interest to
deal with China rather than seek to isolate it with economic sanctions over
human rights abuses.
There is a definitive book to be written about China's economic rise,
rapidly moving target though it is. This is a long way from being that book.

Financial reporting in the West Pacific Rim
Edited by TE Cooke and RH Parker Routledge,
Pounds 50
450 pages
Accounting and Society
by RW Perks
Chapman &amp; Hall, Pounds 15.99
213 pages
The enormous post-war growth of the economies of the Far East has brought
about corresponding, but little discussed, changes in financial reporting
practices in the region.
It should also have increased the importance of considering the impact of
these practices, which is why Financial Reporting in the West Pacific Rim is
a useful addition to the literature.
We learn that Japan only adopted double-entry bookkeeping in the 1870s; and
that the Philippines still has an underdeveloped stock market, because the
system was introduced by its US colonisers but has not taken off because of
the closely-held nature of companies.
It seems there are as many ways of classifying accounting systems in the
region as there are authors, including one which divides the countries into
'Anglo', 'Commonwealth' and 'Cloud-pine'.
The editors see little evidence of efforts to harmonise standards, and there
is still a wide diversity. They should be congratulated for managing to find
some authors for the book who are from the countries about which they write.
It is a shame they were apparently unable to find a contributor who could
have written for them on Indonesia. More disappointing is that they decided
against sections on the more exotic financial reporting regimes in countries
such as China, Cambodia and Vietnam.
On a different tack, it is welcome to find a book on accounting that takes a
broader view of the sector than purely technical texts.
Accounting and Society, by Bob Perks, a professor at Birkbeck College of the
University of London, makes some controversial points in a skim across the
realms of the sociology of the subject.
He argues that accountants are under commercial pressures, and suggests that
their energies are focused on maintaining the appearance rather than
necessarily the practice of independence. He quotes one writer who remembers
being told by a senior partner at his firm: 'You can do anything with our
clients but don't lose them.'
He says there should be a 'Campaign for Independent Auditors' to counter
this problem, although he fails to analyse why no such initiative has
emerged.
Even more controversially, he suggests auditors can be seen as supporting
'criminal' activities, such as increasing management's income and the value
of their shareholdings at the expense of third parties.
Perks makes a case for greater social reporting, a movement which had its
heyday in the 1970s, and argues that there should be extremely wide access
to corporate information, except for sensitive personal data on individual
employees. He neglects to discuss the issues of commercial confidentiality.

Japanese investment motives matter / Aspects of Japan

Does Ownership Matter?
Edited by Mark Mason and Dennis Encarnation
Oxford University Press, Pounds 39.95
459 pages
Although Japanese investment in Europe goes back as far as 1878, when Mitsui
opened its first office in Paris, it is only recently that it has reached
significant proportions.
Early investments, interrupted of course by the second world war, were
mainly concerned with providing services to Japanese companies. Hence
shipping, insurance and finance played a prominent role. The change since
the 1970s is the growth of manufacturing investment, which has been heavily
motivated by fears of trade protection.
This book is an early academic attempt to analyse these more recent flows.
In particular, it seeks to compare the behaviour of Japanese companies in
Europe and in the US, as well as setting Japanese patterns of investment in
Europe against those of the US. Its origin is a conference in 1992, for
which the papers are being published, together with commentaries from
rapporteurs that are either bafflingly censorious or gushing in their
praise.
That format is bound to restrict its readership to academic specialists. As
so often before, the lay reader is struck by the slowness of academic
publishing, the sloppiness of the editing and the poor quality of much of
the writing. Moreover, such a wide-ranging list of contributors is never
going to agree entirely with one another. But the book does assemble some
new sets of data, and it does have a certain message to impart, which is
that ownership does matter.
By establishing wholly-owned subsidiaries in Europe, Japanese companies have
not only secured the distribution of their products; they have also
maintained control over the production process. Compared with US owners,
they still import a large number of components - or did so when the research
was carried out.
In that sense, the motivation behind Japanese foreign investment is more to
do with trade supremacy in an environment of increasing physical barriers.
European companies rarely establish wholly-owned subsidiaries in Japan; it
may be that the culture which prevents them from doing so is one which also
wants to ensure Japanese supremacy in its own market.
It follows, the book argues, that European policymakers should be concerned
with investment. The book speaks in quite admiring tones of the way in which
the European side implicitly put pressure on Japanese car manufacturers not
to flood previously restricted markets with output transplanted to European
sites when barriers came down in the single market. It suggests there may be
lessons for US policymakers here, too.
That, however, is dangerous stuff. Ultimately it is in nobody's interest
that governments should discriminate in matters of investment. Competition
is distorted, efficiency gains lost and consumers suffer just as they do
when trade in goods is protected. European companies would benefit more from
an open environment, in which they could forge alliances that allow all to
benefit from what technology has to offer.

the Life and Literature of Lafcadio Hearn
by Paul Murray
Japan Library, Knoll House, 35 The Crescent, Sandgate, Folkestone, Kent.
CT20 3EE, Pounds 19.99
379 pages
One sunny April morning, 104 years ago, the small form of Patrick Lafcadio
Hearn, an obscure provincial journalist, stepped ashore at Japan's Yokohama
dock, after a long sea voyage from Vancouver.
Dazzled by 'the white sunshine of a perfect spring day,' Hearn, aged 39,
felt that he had arrived 'in the land of dreams - surrounded by strange
gods.' He was to spend the 14 remaining years of his life there, 'trying to
see into the heart of this mysterious people,' as he modestly put it.
The experience transformed Hearn from a failed Victorian romantic writer
into one of the greatest interpreters of Japan's high-speed transition in
the late 19th century from a medieval to a modern society.
Hearn fell in love with Japan, which he saw as an orderly refuge from his
own turbulent past, and a means to artistic fulfilment. He married a
Japanese, fell out of love with Japan in his old age, when he came to see
the country as suffocatingly insular, and became the first foreigner to be
buried there with the Buddhist rite.
This biography is not, strictly speaking, a business book. Yet it is an
agreeable way of sharpening one's understanding of what makes this country
tick, at a time when Japan is going through bewilderingly rapid change, just
as it was in Hearn's time.
Half Irish and half Greek, this odd character has over the years become a
mainstream literary figure for many Japanese - so an understanding of Hearn
throws some light on Japan's soul.
Hearn's popularity among Japanese readers is understandable, given his view
of Japan as a mirror to show to the west its own moral inadequacy. The 12
books he wrote there also include a poetic record - in the ghost stories,
for which he is best known in Japan - of an era for which many urban folk
feel increasing nostalgia as Japan becomes more western.
Hearn's ideas, clearly explained in this book, are a useful guide to the
traditions behind modern Japanese behaviour. His admiration for ju-jutsu,
the art of applying an opponent's own strength to defeat him, invites an
obvious moral for anyone negotiating with Japanese business or government.
Some scholars have even claimed that the US would have understood Japan
better before Pearl Harbour if it had paid more attention to Hearn's
analyses of Japan's moral and religious standards.
He was one of the first westerners to recognise the importance of Shinto,
later a staple of Japan's militarism. Hearn likened Shinto to the
ancestor-worship practised by the ancient Greeks, and saw many other
parallels between 19th century Japan and ancient Greek society.
To its credit, Paul Murray's biography does not try to ram home pretentious
modern lessons from Hearn's life. Instead, this is a straightforward account
of Hearn's multi-faceted story, by a biographer whose career as an Irish
diplomat in New York and Tokyo parallels some of Hearn's own travels.
It is hard to pick up a biography that shows as much respect for its
subject's character as this one does, because Hearn was an unattractive,
prickly, man. 'Always ill-dressed, unkempt, slovenly; with the face of a
weasel and the manners of an oaf, he was nevertheless one of the most
brilliant and picturesque writers of his day,' in the words of one newspaper
obituary.
One of Mr Murray's important themes is that Hearn's strange life helped make
him free from prejudice in explaining Japan, by comparison with the zealous
Christian missionaries and European-minded professors writing about the
country at the time - and many commmentators since.
Hearn's personal fantastic journey began on the Greek island of Lefkas, from
which he got his middle name, in 1850, when he was born to an Irish surgeon
in the British army and a beautiful but illiterate local woman.
His parents soon split up, leaving Hearn to be brought up by an aunt in
Dublin, in an environment of cultured leisure, only to be packed off in his
late teens to what appears to have been a brutal life in an English boarding
school. Hearn left school at the age of 19, minus one eye - lost during a
game, and a source of lasting psychological awkwardness - to try his luck as
a journalist in the American provincial city of Cincinnati.
There, he specialised in writing about 'the rotten underbelly of society',
including murders, executions, slaughterhouses and city corruption. This
taste for the grotesque later manifested itself in his prolific output of
popular fiction - Hearn is an exponent of the Victorian horror genre,
alongside Bram Stoker and Edgar Allan Poe.
A short-lived illegal marriage with the daughter of a negro slave in
Cincinnati precipitated a scandal. Hearn escaped to New Orleans, where he
became the small-town star of the local newspaper and started to publish his
first works of popular fiction. New Orleans treated him well, but the
ever-restless Hearn wanted a taste adventure.
Armed with a publishers' commission, he set off for the West Indies, for
what turned out to be a disappointing two-year stay in search of inspiration
for more popular fiction.
Hearn romantically claims that his decision to try Japan for his next
adventure began with the 'pleasure bordering on pain' derived from looking
at a paper fan with a simple bamboo design.
As Mr Murray explains, the decision to emigrate to Japan was more
complicated. Chance played a part in keeping him there for the rest of his
days, ending in the arms of his Japanese family in Tokyo. His life was,
appropriately for a journalist, a great story. Moreover, it is a story that
contains a few pertinent messages for anybody trying to understand modern
Japan.

FT  15 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Dilution fears hit Disney
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A roller coaster ride in Euro Disney ended with shares in the theme park
operator under severe pressure as analysts and investors took fright at the
group's restructuring plan.
The day had started well for the loss-making French group as the refinancing
scheme hammered out with its bankers sent the shares sharply higher in
London and Paris.
Underpinning the rise was the belief that a FFr6bn rights issue would be
issued at slightly below the current share price of around FFr25. However,
at a subsequent meeting with the company the picture changed dramatically.
Shareholders learned that the rights issue - which will more than quadruple
the number of shares to 770m - was to be made at just FFr10.
Euro Disney fell sharply on news of the potential dilution, closing a net 28
off at 390p with turnover approaching 500,000 shares, 10 times its normal
London level. Ms Rebecca Winnington-Ingram at Morgan Stanley said: 'The
dilution is enormous. We continue to believe that the shares are
fundamentally overvalued at current levels.'
A report that the industry-wide hit over the mis-selling of pensions would
be only Pounds 100m, compared with a previous estimate of Pounds 1bn, gave a
lift to life insurers, with Legal &amp; General leading the way. L&amp;G, further
squeezed by a shortage of stock in the market and patchy buying ahead of
figures on Thursday, rose 16 to 483p.
The report, cited in a Sunday newspaper, apparently suggested that only one
person in every 10 who transferred from occupational pensions to personal
plans was expected to claim. The news helped sentiment, although one analyst
pointed out that Refuge, a small life insurer, had made Pounds 11.6m of
provisions for pensions and that figure would probably translate to Pounds
1bn across the board. Refuge closed at 341p ex-dividend.
Oil major British Petroleum moved ahead 8 to 359p as consideration of the
full report and accounts released on Saturday confirmed previous optimism
over cost-cutting and the reserve replacement figures. Hoare Govett pointed
out that although the annual report showed costs were flat in sterling
terms, they were down Pounds 1bn in dollar terms, the currency BP deals in
principally.
Shell Transport was held back by a large line of stock washing around the
market. The shares, which went ex a 15p dividend yesterday, closed unchanged
at 677p after a line of 2m shares was placed in the market at 677p.
Rumours resurfaced that French oil group Elf Aquitaine was poised to sell
its near 10 per cent stake in Enterprise, the oil exploration and production
company. Analysts said the disposal made good sense and would possibly
happen one day, but both companies had denied the speculation, which had
been sparked by a Sunday newspaper report. Enterprise ended 3 up at 414p.
Oversold composite insurers, with big holdings in leading financial markets,
bounced in response to rises on Wall Street, for the Footsie and in US
bonds.
Royal Insurance, regarded as the cheap buy in the sector after
underperforming the All-Share index by 17 per cent over the past three
months, improved 13 to 279p. Commercial Union firmed 5 to 583p and Sun
Alliance appreciated 6 1/2 to 327p.
Insurance broker JIB jumped 19 to 199p after announcing top of the range
profits of Pounds 21.8m and an upbeat statement.
The busy building and construction sectors saw a demerger, several results
and interest rate cut hopes inspire a raft of sharp moves forward.
Figures from English China Clays came in ahead of market forecasts and were
joined by details of the group's plans to spin-off CAMAS, its construction
materials division. The demerger will be by way of a one-for-one share issue
effective on June 1. ECC shares added 13 at 524p. UBS reiterated its buy
stance.
There were results also from Rugby Group, which again came in ahead of
market expectations. They closed 4 up at 328p, additionally helped by the
proposed one-for-one scrip issue. Spring Ram results were in line with
forecasts and this relieved some buyers following the group's recent
chequered history. The shares gained 4 at 67p. Costain put on 2 1/4 at 35
1/2 p following a return to profitability. German interest rate cut hopes
helped Redland rise 12 to 562p.
Restructuring plans at Simon Engineering, including a Pounds 50m rights
issue, were well received and the shares advanced 11 to 117p.
Expectations that the government will soon announce the lifting of the limit
on overseas ownership in Rolls-Royce and British Aerospace boosted both
stocks yesterday. The former moved up 5 to 184p and the latter 8 to 519p.
Analysts expect the government to lift the limit from the prevailing 29.5
per cent to 49.5 per cent.
Nervousness about figures later this month saw Lucas Industries surrender 3
to 212p. TI Group, which disappointed the market last week with the
presentation of its figures, remained in the doldrums. The shares closed at
391p xd.
The market appreciated Cookson Group's Pounds 71.9m disposal of its
engineering businesses to Calder Group. Shares in the industrial materials
group climbed 9 to 285p.
International conglomerate Lonrho gained 5 at 163p on reports that Ashanti
Goldfield, set to be floated this year, will be valued at around Pounds
1.5bn, against earlier predictions of around Pounds 1bn. Lonrho has a 25 per
cent stake in Ashanti. Williams Holdings put on 8 at 403p ahead of today's
results.
Media investment group MAI rose 18 1/2 to 299p after sharply improved
interim profits.
Mirror Group Newspapers added 5 at 190p in anticipation of good figures
today. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, which is also reporting today, slipped 5 to 142p,
although the stock suffered from receding speculation of a US bidder.
Big turnover in Hillsdown Holdings was thought to have been inspired by a
positive note from James Capel, a delayed reaction to last week's results
and report of directors' share buying. The stock moved forward 4 to 165p,
with turnover touching 10m.
Food retailers were buoyed by weekend press reports of tough talking from
Asda to its suppliers on price and selected brokers continuing to peddle a
positive outlook story. Asda shares edged 1 1/2 ahead to 59 1/2 p. J.
Sainsbury rose 15 1/2 to 376p and Tesco 2 1/2 to 224p.
Renewed doubts over the opening date of the Channel tunnel hit Eurotunnel,
the tunnel's operator. The shares fell 21 to 540p.
A threat of legal action saw Mersey Docks &amp; Harbour dip 14 to 495p.
Encouraging figures from Scotia Holdings, the research-based pharmaceutical
company floated in October, saw the shares advance 10 to 255p.
Coats Viyella improved 11 to 277p ahead of figures scheduled for tomorrow.

The recovery in both US and European bonds, together with renewed hopes of a
reduction in interest rates, helped the derivatives sector to a steadier
performance, writes Joel Kibazo.
In its last full week of trading ahead of Friday's expiry, the Liffe March
contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 3,203, in line with the opening on the
underlying cash market. Buyers encouraged by the recovery in US bonds at the
end of last week helped the contract advance in early trading.
The release of encouraging February producer price data, once again led to
hopes of a reduction in interest rates, encouraging increased buying of
March as it climbed to its peak of 3,238 in the afternoon.
Following a bout of profit-taking March finished at 3,233, up 62 on its
previous close and at parity with the cash market. Volume at the official
close stood at 16,756 lots.
The Liffe FT-SE mid-250 March contract closed at 3,895 after business of 175
lots, while the same contract on the OMLX finished at 3,888.2 after trading
235 contracts.
In traded options, volume on Liffe fell to 32,435 lots with 18,471 dealt in
the FT-SE 100 option. British Airways, the busiest stock option, saw 1,889
lots dealt.

FT  15 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 100 recaptures 3,200 after
bonds recover - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London stock market regained all and more of the ground lost last Friday
as dealers warmed to further encouraging news on inflation and responded to
yet more hints of European interest rate cuts.
There was further comfort for London in the performance of US markets, where
the long bond attracted little pressure in either direction and where the
Dow Jones Industrial Average opened marginally firmer before slipping into
negative territory after London closed.
Mr Ian Harnett at broker Strauss Turnbull described the London market's
showing as 'a tremendous performance', adding that he saw scope 'for more
interest rate cuts'.
The FT-SE 100 Index ended a relatively subdued trading session a net 41.5
ahead at 3,233.4, just short of the day's high and easily outpacing the
FT-SE Mid 250 Index of second line stocks, which rose 28.3 to 3,885.7.
London's excellent performance was part of a Europe-wide advance by bond and
equity markets as some of the impetus of the recent Whitewater story in the
US was lost over the weekend.
UK share prices began the new two-week trading account in good form, with
dealers marking prices higher in response to Wall Street's good showing and
the widespread strong gains in gilts and bonds.
The FT-SE 100 was up 11 points at the opening, a creditable performance
given that no less than 15 constituents were quoted ex-dividend, equal to 12
index points.
Sentiment was given a substantial boost shortly after the opening from news
of much better than expected producer price numbers for February, indicating
that inflationary pressures remain under control and leading to increased
speculation of a further reduction in UK interest rates.
Dealers responded to the good producer price numbers by marking share prices
sharply higher, attempting to head off any sizeable buying, and the FT-SE
100 responded by touching the day's best level, 3,236.1, up 44.2, shortly
before the Wall Street opening.
The latter's reluctance to make further headway and its gradual decline as
European markets closed for the day triggered small bouts of profit-taking
in London, with the FT-SE 100 eventually settling for a 1.3 per cent gain on
the day.
One of the more disappointing features of the trading session, dealers said,
was the low level of business. Turnover was never more than modest all day
and eventually reached 555.2m shares, one of the lowest daily totals this
year. Non-Footsie stocks accounted for 58 per cent of the total.
Marketmakers warned that the low level of activity yesterday would drag the
value of customer business transacted towards the Pounds 1bn. Last week saw
a pick-up in customer activity, which topped Pounds 2bn on Thursday.
The value of customer trade on Friday was Pounds 1.8bn. They also said that
many of the big trading firms had been badly bruised during the erratic
trading in bonds and equities in recent weeks.
Although encouraged by the market's resilience after the recent slide,
senior dealers cautioned that the rest of the week sees a raft of important
economic data from the UK and the US.
From the latter, today's producer price numbers and tomorrow's consumer
price figures are seen as crucial indicators. Tomorrow also brings important
data on UK retail sales and unemployment trends for February.

FT  15 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US investors await week's
economic data

Wall Street
US share prices showed little change yesterday as investors cautiously
awaited a batch of economic news due out later in the week, writes Frank
McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished a slight 0.28 higher at 3,862.98
and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 edged up 0.95 to 467.39. Secondary markets
fared a little better, the American SE composite adding 2.08 at 468.06 and
the Nasdaq composite 3.60 at 792.80. New York SE volume amounted to 260.2m
shares and rising issues led declines by 1,149 to 943.
After Friday's heady 32-point Dow advance, a sober mood returned to Wall
Street. Investors were facing a series of economic reports over the course
of the week, and the anticipation reinforced a general sense of uncertainty
which has dominated the market since the beginning of February.
February producer price data, due today, and last month's consumer price
index, to be released the following day, were commanding the most attention.
With bond traders expecting the reports to supply further evidence of
accelerating inflation, US Treasury prices weakened and the yield on the
benchmark 30-year issue again crept within strik-ing distance of 7.0 per
cent, a symbolic point of support.
During yesterday's session, the pessimistic scenario on inflation was
reinforced by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. Its February survey of
regional economic conditions showed an unsettling increase in prices paid by
manufacturers in the south-east, a possible harbinger of a broader trend.
The report also indicated strong economic conditions in the region, but on
balance, the likelihood of continued weakness in bonds left equity investors
in a timid mood.
The negative sentiment was most evident in the blue chips, which meandered
within a narrow range of their opening levels during the morning.
Smaller-capitalised issues managed to post modest gains.
The Dow was held back by Walt Disney, down Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 45 7/8
on heavy volume. The stock fell on news of a restructuring plan for its Euro
Disney theme park.
Technology stocks were well represented in the NYSE's most active list.
Digital Equipment advanced Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 32 3/8 after announcing
plans to issue 20m depositary shares priced at Dollars 25 each.
International Business Machines gained Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 57 1/2 ,
while Unisys added Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 16 1/4 on volume of 4.3m shares.
Elsewhere, Federal Express climbed Dollars 3 to Dollars 70 5/8 on news of a
14 per cent rise in delivery volume last month.
Among banking issues, Chemical moved ahead Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 37 3/4
after Mr Judah Kraushaar, an analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York, raised
his rating on the stock to 'buy'. Bankers Trust New York put on Dollars 1
1/4 at Dollars 75 5/8 .
On the Nasdaq, Microsoft was marked up Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 83 7/8 after
the company unveiled new applications software for Apple's Macintosh
computers. Apple was Dollars  7/8 higher at Dollars 38 1/8 .
Canada
Toronto posted a solid gain in fairly heavy trading. The TSE 300 composite
index ended 23.5 stronger at 4,470.4.
Advances outscored declines by 466 to 311. Volume of 75.7m shares was well
below Friday's 95m, while trading value was CDollars 681.7m. Most sectors
were firmer but golds eased.

FT  15 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Italy and Germany forge ahead

A wide range of performances characterised the world's equity markets last
week.
Among the European components of the FT-Actuaries World Index, strong rises
by both Italy and Germany, up 2.7 per cent and 1.6 per cent respectively in
local currency terms, were countered by a 2.5 per cent decline in the UK,
one of 1.9 per cent in Norway and of 1 per cent in Switzerland.
Norwegian equities turned negative late in the week after Norsk Hydro, the
energy and fertilisers group, unexpectedly announced that it was to raise
some NKr5bn through an international rights issue.
However, the market stabilised yesterday, in line with a general feeling
among European analysts that the Bundesbank would make a further cut in
interest rates at its council meeting in two days' time, its last before a
four week break over Easter.
Mr Brian Mullaney of Morgan Stanley's global economics group comments that
resolution of the IG Metall dispute represents 'a giant first step in
Germany's struggle to improve competitiveness. Given the moderation in
domestic cost pressures, we would expect the Buba to revert back to a more
consistent pattern of easing and begin to downplay the potential
inflationary risks associated with a somewhat weaker Deutschemark'.
The situation among Asia's markets remained nervous, with Malaysia and
Singapore continuing to add to the falls of the previous week, partly over
worries that US interest rates might be on the rise.
In spite of Japan's slight fall last week, contributing to a 0.1 per cent
decline in the FT-Actuaries World Index, sentiment there remained good.
UBS Global Research, for example, forecasts that the Nikkei average will
finish the financial year-end at around the 20,000 level, an estimate
supported by yesterday's 2 per cent gain.
'While investors were largely chasing an illusion of economic recovery in
1993, they should be able to buy into the reality in 1994,' UBS writes. 'The
problem in this scenario is the extent to which the exporting sectors, which
are supposed to drive the recovery, have already outpaced the market. In the
electrical machinery sector, p/e ratios of a number of issues are already at
levels which are difficult to justify, even on the basis of past peak
profits.'
