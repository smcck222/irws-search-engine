FT  15 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Cellular phones accord
takes Nikkei up 2% to 1994 high

Resolution of the US-Japan trade dispute, a retreat in the yen against the
dollar and signs of improving economic conditions took the Nikkei 225
average up by 2 per cent to a year's high, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index was ahead 410.84 at 20,526.15 after an opening low for the day of
20,157.72 and high of 20,580.96. 'The market rose on technical buying amid
the feeling that corporate selling was out of the way,' said Mr Rod Smyth, a
strategist at Baring Securities.
The yen and bond markets stabilised following the US-Japan trade accord on
cellular phones over the weekend. A survey by the Ministry of Trade and
Industry indicated an improvement in business confidence.
Volume was 480m shares, against 737m last Friday when March futures and
option contracts were settled. Foreigners and arbitrageurs turned buyers,
while dealers, who had refrained from activity last week, citing fears of
rising US interest rates, supported share prices. Technical analysts are now
focusing on whether the Nikkei 225 index can break through the 21,000 level
reached last September.
Rises led falls by 882 to 194, with 124 issues unchanged. The Topix index
added 19.97 at 1,639.87, while the Nikkei 300 advanced 3.46 to 301.88. In
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 3.39 at 1,362.17.
High-technology stocks gained ground on broad-based buying. Toshiba, the
day's most active issue, moved forward Y13 to Y793.
Expectations of a smaller loss for the current year to March supported
Victor, the audio visual maker. The stock closed at a bidded price of
Y1,560. Overseas buying supported automobile issues. Nissan Motor gained Y23
at Y923.
Individual investors supported speculative favourites. Japan Energy climbed
Y14 to Y452 on its development of an anti-Aids drug, while Clarion rose Y12
to Y497.
Kajima, the construction group, weakened Y14 to Y948 after last week's
arrest of Mr Kishiro Nakamura, former construction minister, for allegedly
receiving bribes from the company.
Kankaku Securities, a second tier Japanese broker, lost Y6 at Y639. The
broker announced last week that it had incurred losses of Y50bn from illicit
client transactions. But Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, the commercial bank which
will support Kankaku by extending subordinated loans, rose Y30 to Y1,950.
In Osaka, the OSE average moved ahead 275.24 to 22,372.83 in volume of
114.3m shares.
Roundup
Yesterday was the Moslem holiday of Eid Al-Fitr. Markets were closed for
this, or other holidays, in Bombay, Karachi, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and
Jakarta.
HONG KONG reversed early losses after a more conciliatory tone emerged from
Sino-US talks in Beijing. The afternoon rebound left the Hang Seng index
74.41 up at 9,980.07 after an earlier fall of about 300 points. Turnover was
light.
Swire Pacific, Dollars 2 higher at HKDollars 55, reported a 5 per cent rise
in profits.
AUSTRALIA's All Ordinaries index gained 26.2 at 2,179.3, brokers citing
Japan's opening of its cellular telephone market to the US-based Motorola,
stronger bond prices and a higher Wall Street close on Friday as buoying
sentiment.
The golds index was 53.9 higher at 2,392.8 on the bullion price, which rose
on political tensions in South Africa.
SEOUL climbed for the third consecutive session on interest in banking
shares and asset plays, the composite index adding 9.41 at 912.83 after
touching 921.37. Banks were tipped for support in advance of rights issues,
the sector index gaining 25.83 at 604.17.
TAIWAN rose 1.2 per cent in a technical rebound from last week's 6.1 per
cent drop, the weighted index closing 60.77 higher at 5,333.87. Turnover was
thin at TDollars 40.92bn.
MANILA rose on bargain hunting and stock dividends from Manila Electric and
Filinvest Land, the composite index closing 72.80 up at 2,631.53.
SHANGHAI investors went on a buying spree after a package of measures from
security regulators to rescue plummeting share prices. Turnover was so high
that it knocked out the computer system for a period; the A share index rose
75.44, or 10.2 per cent, to 811.69.

FT  15 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses buoyant after Friday's
recovery in Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses were buoyant on Friday's late recovery on Wall Street, but there was
an underlying note of caution ahead of US economic figures this week, writes
Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT, relatively firm last Friday afternoon, positively took off
yesterday with the Dax index 41.68, or 2 per cent higher at 2,145.17 on the
session, and another 1.1 per cent better in the post bourse at an Ibis-based
2,169.40.
Financials returned to favour, Deutsche Bank topping a session rise of
DM12.50 to DM803.50 with a further DM11 to DM814.50 after hours. Mr
Horst-Kaspar Greven of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf said that the turn in US
bond yields, the low dollar and a firm domestic bond market - reflecting
hopes of a further interest rate cut this Thursday - had produced a scenario
in which Deutsche, particularly, could be expected to make money.
Foreigners were buying the big blue chips again, said Mr Greven. Turnover
rose from DM8.2bn to DM8.5bn and Volkswagen, a blue chip in favour, rose
DM13.70 to DM485.50 in the morning, and another DM7 to DM492.50 in the
afternoon.
Analysts were impressed initially with Schering's 21 per cent sales growth
in the first two months of 1994, but a more cautious tone came into the
market late in the afternoon and the shares closed with their session gain
of DM16 to DM1,036.
PARIS ended the day broadly higher in line with other European markets and
the positive tone from Frankfurt in particular. The CAC-40 index finished up
40.11 or 1.8 per cent at 2,215.02.
The day's main excitement was Euro Disney, which initially advanced some 8
per cent on news that the financial restructuring package had been agreed,
before falling back by almost the same amount as investors realised that the
rights issue would be extremely dilutive. The shares finished down FFr2.90
at FFr33.85.
Mr Michael Woodcock at Nikko Europe explained that 600m new shares would be
issued at FFr10 each, swelling the number in issue from 170m to 770m. The
package, he said, was good news for Euro Disney, which had got its
restructuring package through, and thereby would be able to half its debt to
some FFr10bn, but was bad news for the minority shareholders.
AMSTERDAM recouped Friday's losses, the AEX index ending 5.97 or 1.4 per
cent higher at 423.90.
KNP BT, the paper and packaging group, picked up Fl 1.70 to Fl 50.10 after
reporting over the weekend that it was to declare a 45 cent dividend, and
giving a bullish outlook on prospects for 1994.
Ahold and Elsevier, which are due to publish 1993 results on Thursday
improved respectively by 70 cents and Fl 2.90 to Fl 49.40 and Fl 178.90.
Hoare Govett liked both, and commented that Ahold should be one of the major
beneficiaries of strength in the dollar.
MILAN finished higher but off its best, helped by strong telecoms and by
short-covering ahead of tomorrow's end of the monthly account. The Comit
index added 8.52 or 1.3 per cent to 673.78.
Telecoms were supported by weekend comments from Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi,
the prime minister, confirming the privatisation timetable. Sip rose L70 or
1.5 per cent to L4,604 and Stet added L110 or 2.2 per cent to L5,016.
Cogefar rose L135 or 4.1 per cent to L3,435, as interest was spurred by the
launch of its rights issue on Thursday and the planned merger with other
building companies into Italy's largest construction group.
Domestic and foreign demand took Mediobanca L685 or 4.5 per cent higher to
L15,871, but analysts said there was no news to account for the rise. BCI,
whose privatised shares will be traded from Thursday, added L100 or 1.6
percent to L6,212.
ZURICH advanced 1.4 per cent, taking its lead from strong bond and equity
markets elsewhere in Europe, but the low level of business indicated that
investors remained cautious. The SMI index rose 38.9 to 2,870.5.
Cyclical stocks remained at the centre of attention. Foreign demand and a
positive recommendation from a local bank took Oerlikon-Buhrle SFr15 higher
to SFr169. Brown Boveri bearers continued higher, adding SFr33 to SFr1,212
and Sulzer certificates rose SFr45 to SFr1,060. Banks picked up some of
their recent losses. Credit Suisse bearers rose SFr18 to SFr634.
MADRID offered good rises in US quoted stocks and, inter alia, in Banesto
and in Acerinox, the stainless steel company in which Banesto had a 34.5 per
cent stake until some five months ago.
The general index rose 5.52, or 1.7 per cent to 338.88 in tunover of
Pta27.2bn. Of the ADR stocks, Repsol rose Pta145 to Pta 4,730 and Telefonica
by Pta45 to Pta1,950. Banesto rose Pta33, or 4.5 per cent to Pta768 as
Santander converted loans into 2.1 per cent of the equity; Acerinox
recovered another Pta260 to Pta12,500 after dipping to Pta10,800 nearly two
weeks ago, but dealers were cautious after a rise from around Pta9,000 last
September.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Markets Report: D-Mark moves lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What foreign exchanges lacked in trading activity yesterday, they made up in
policy speculation as both the D-Mark and sterling weakened amid heightened
expectations of interest rate cuts, writes Philip Gawith.
In Germany the catalyst was the heavy political defeat for the ruling CDU
party in the Lower Saxony parliamentary election, and bullish inflation
comments from Bundesbank president Mr Hans Tietmeyer.
In the UK, better than expected producer price figures again focused market
attention on the prospect of lower interest rates.
The dollar had a quieter day after the tribulations of last week. The
release of February producer inflation figures today - and consumer numbers
tomorrow - will, however, return it to centre stage.
The Bundesbank repo announcement today will also be closely watched for
indications of the pace of monetary easing in Germany, and hence Europe.
The D-Mark was softer across the board yesterday ahead of the repo
announcement. In each of the past two weeks the Bundesbank has trimmed the
repo by three basis points.
The German currency closed in London at FFr3.398 from FFr3.402 against the
French franc; at L988.1 from L990.9 against the Italian lira; and at
Pta81.94 against the Spanish peseta from Pta82.23.
Although the CDU's poor showing in Sunday's election was not unexpected, it
reminded the market that some political risk must attach to a country that
faces 19 elections in seven months.
Of greater importance were Mr Tietmeyer's comments that he expected German
consumer inflation to move below 2 per cent.
Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan (Europe), said
the Euromark contracts in the futures market 'showed some halting of the
interest-rate pessimism of last week'. The June contract rose by four basis
points to 94.56, indicating that the market expects rates to fall by 50
basis points over the next three months. The repo rate is currently at 5.94
per cent.
Analysts believe that the Bundesbank has scope to cut interest rates more
aggressively. Compared with conditions when the discount rate was lowered in
mid-February, the D-Mark is now much stronger, key wage settlements have
been very modest, and the inflation outlook is better.
Of the Bundesbank's intermediate targets, only M3 is out of line.
Ironically, the 21.2 per cent growth in January was so bad that analysts
argue that credibility could actually be lost if too much attention is paid
to it.
The Bank of France yesterday left its intervention rate unchanged at 6.10
per cent. Although the D-Mark/French franc exchange rate remains fairly
stable, dealers report evidence of greater volumes in this currency pair.
Sterling weakened yesterday when the release of better than expected
February producer inflation numbers renewed speculation about an interest
rate cut. Output prices for manufactured goods rose by 0.1 per cent last
month, slower than the 0.3 per cent forecast by economists for February, and
also below January's 0.3 per cent increase.
The Bank of England's sterling exchange rate index finished at 80.6 after
opening at 80.8. The UK currency closed slightly higher in London at
DM2.5254, from DM2.5210, against the weaker German currency, but was down
compared with the dollar, finishing at Dollars 1.4945 from Dollars 1.5025.
Mr Mark Geddes, treasury economist at Midland Global Markets, said the
numbers indicated a 'total lack of inflationary pressures', and gave the
government more flexibility about a future rate cut.
Mr Robert Thomas, bond and currency strategist at Natwest Markets, said he
thought the government was more concerned about conditions in the real
economy than inflation. He predicted that the government might wait for a
general lowering of European rates.
Sterling futures responded positively, with the June contract up by two
points to 94.84. The March 1995 contract rose by five points to 94.24,
indicating that the market is expecting base rates of 5.76 per cent a year
hence - 50 basis points above the current 5.25 per cent.
In the cash market, sterling three-month money was unchanged on the news at
5 3/16 per cent. In the discount market, the Bank of England provided Pounds
375m of late assistance. Earlier it had provided the market with Pounds 999m
of liquidity, compared to a revised shortage of Pounds 1.45bn. The overnight
rate reached a high of 7 per cent during the day.
The dollar was steadier ahead of today's important February producer
inflation release. Ever since the Federal Reserve tightened policy on
February 4, financial markets have been nervous about resurgent inflation in
the US.
The US currency finished more than a pfennig up at DM1.6898 from DM1.6779.
Helped by the resolution of the Motorola cellular phone case, it also ended
firmer against the yen at Y105.880 from Y105.125. The dollar moved higher in
New York trading to close at DM1.6910 and Y106.175.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Profitability declines
worldwide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Profitability of coal companies worldwide has declined sharply in the past
decade and the industry appears to be entering a period of stagnation or
decline, according to a report by Sheffield Energy &amp; Resources Information
Services.
The return on average coal assets among 39 companies tracked by Seris fell
from 10.4 per cent in 1985 to 6.1 per cent in 1992.
The authors also note that the 63 companies in their coal export survey
registered a small decline in export volumes during 1991-92.
The top 10 world coal companies ranked by profit margin include six whose
operations are mainly in the western states of the US. RTZ of the UK has
recently bought into this highly profitable sector, the report notes.
Whereas the rate of return for eight companies whose operations are mainly
in the eastern US is consistently higher than the global rate, the
opposisite is the case for the 10 companies based mainly in the centre and
east of the US.
The report notes a restructuring in the world industry, the most extreme
example of which has been seen in the UK in the last 18 months with the
closure of more than 33 of 50 pits.
A similar process has been occuring in Japan, France and Belgium and in the
coal and lignite mines of eastern Europe.
In the US, restructuring has concentrated mroe on takeover and merger
activity.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee surges on cut in
Brazilian crop estimate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coffee futures prices surged through the Dollars 1,300-a-tonne level in
London yesterday after the US Department of Agriculture revised its forecast
of Brazil's 1994-95 crop downwards by nearly 1m bags.
The second position robusta futures contract reached its highest closing
level since last September, ending at Dollars 1,305, up Dollars 30 on the
day and just Dollars 2 below the day's high.
Technical buying in London was accompanied by interest from investment funds
and the market remained buoyant after a strong start in New York.
'It's gone from strength to strength and hasn't looked back,' said one
trader.
In early afternoon trading in New York the second position arabica futures
contract was up 2.45 at 81.25 cents a pound.
The boost to an already bullish market came from the USDA's downward
revision of the Brazilian crop from 24.3m bags (60kg each) to 23.5m bags.
GNI, the London broker, said the USDA's figures were usually about 4m bags
higher than Brazilian estimates because it used a much higher figure for
local demand.
'However, this should mean that the local consensus will fall and a crop of
19m to 20m bags should be expected,' it said in its daily commodity report.
One analyst said the USDA figures provided further encouragement to a market
buoyed by signs of smaller crops in Colombia and across Central America, as
illustrated by lower shipments in the four months since the start of the
crop year last October.
'Everyone's pleased,' he said. 'It adds a bit more support to the coffee
world, which has been through so many rough periods.'
The other positive fundamental factor has been the relatively smooth running
of the export retention scheme which came into operation in October in most
coffee-producing countries in an attempt to shore up prices.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Chile
warms up to agricultural exporting - Food products are now accounting for 29
per cent of the country's overseas earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chile's new democratic president, Mr Eduardo Frei, whose coalition
government assumed power last Friday, has inherited an agricultural industry
with a growth record that few can match. Expanding farm production and a
dramatic increase in overseas sales of food products, which now account for
29 per cent of export earnings, have made a big contribution to the
country's economic growth, which has averaged almost 7.5 per cent over the
past three years.
Since 1986 exports derived from agriculture, horticulture and forestry have
risen from a little more than USDollars 1bn a year to almost USDollars 3bn,
the greatest expansions being in fruit and timber products.
Most agricultural production takes place in the Central Valley which
stretches 240km north and 950km south of the capital, Santiago. The climate
in the area is Mediterranean and snow melt from the vast Andes range of
mountains provides more water for irrigation than Chilean farmers are ever
likely to need. Soil quality is mainly good and productivity, already
generally high, is improving as new technology is introduced. Average wages
are low, generally not much more than USDollars 3,000 a year.
These factors add up to a potent agri-economic force, always assuming that
inflation, currently 12.2 per cent a year, can be controlled and that labour
remains cheap.
'Chilean businessmen are very ambitious,' says Mr Juan Figueroa, the
outgoing minister of agriculture, who looks back on his period as minister
with satisfaction. 'We set out,' he says, 'to increase production and
productivity; to increase profits to benefit all, including those on low
incomes; and to improve environmental protection. We have been successful as
far as we can tell.'
Needless to say the Sociedad Nacional de Agricultura, the Chilean farmers'
union, does not Mr Figueroa's achievements in quite such a favourable light.
Mr Raul Garcia, the secretary general of the union, points out that the
growth of agricultural production has slowed during the last couple of
years.
He lists a variety of reasons: farmers' profits are too low because of
subsidies in other countries and the lack of them in Chile; the low value of
the Chilean peso restricts export profits; and the Chilean government has
allowed the dumping of farm products from other countries, such as wheat
flour from Argentina, which undermines prices for Chilean farmers.
This combination of factors means that many of Chile's army of small farms
are not viable, the secretary general says. He argues that the government
should design a programme for rationalising these small properties and
assisting the individuals concerned to move to other activities.
Nevertheless Mr Figueroa's 'ambitious businessmen' are showing what can be
done in spite of the problems.
Mr Manuel Aritzia, whose family has built an enormous poultry production and
processing business, is a case in point. The production side of the business
consists of 530 houses, each accommodating 22,000 chickens for meat,
together with all the breeding hens, originally from North American stock,
to make the company totally integrated and self-contained. Another 33 houses
forms the basis of what could become a turkey enterprise of similar scale.
The company also mills and mixes the 24,000 tonnes of feed the poultry
consume each month and then, perhaps less acceptably to British taste, feeds
much of the chicken droppings to beef cattle running on the 15,000 hectares
of land the family owns.
The company also processes every bird it produces, tailoring each carcass,
cut, kebab or whatever to the market for which it is destined. Aritzia
products are exported to every continent.
Chile's leading fruit exporting company is David del Curtis. Dealing in the
entire range of fruit from apples and pears to grapes kiwi fruit, the
company grows 20 per cent of what it exports and buys the rest from about
1,000 Chilean growers. But it is only interested in export quality produce.
Any fruit supplied to it which does not meet the standards required (and
these vary from market to market in nightmarish detail) is wholesaled on the
domestic market for what it will fetch and the grower paid accordingly. The
company has an annual turnover of USDollars 100m.
And then of course there is the wine. Chilean wine makers have a tradition,
not for vintage special years, but for consistency. In order to achieve this
they blend the production of different vineyards and even different years.
Having been brought up in the European school of wine appreciation I was
ready to criticise this 'supermarket' approach. But hard as I tried  - and I
researched the matter most conscientiously - I was unable to find a red or a
white that I could classify as less than excellent. Like the rest of Chilean
produce it is good already but is, I predict, likely to become an even
bigger force to be reckoned with.

FT  15 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Copper hits 6-month high - Market
report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Metal Exchange COPPER prices built on Friday's surge in early
trading, when the three months position reached a six-month high of Dollars
1,952 a tonne. Profit-taking then appeared and by the close it was back to
Dollars 1,944.50, up Dollars 14.75 on the day, but traders remained
confident that bullish charts, improving fundamentals, a shortage of good
quality metal and a big expected drawdown from exchange warehouse stocks
would help the market to mount an assault on upside resistance at Dollars
1,970 before long.
Other base LME contracts fared less well, notably NICKEL, which fell Dollars
52.50 to Dollars 5,565 a tonne for three months delivery as it met trade
selling and long liquidation in thin market conditions.
COCOA futures climbed to the highest levels for nearly three months as fund
buying in the US boosted values at the London Commodity Exchange. The May
futures position closed at Pounds 957 a tonne, up Pounds 31 on the day.
Traders saw the close above Pounds 950 as very constructive. 'The Pounds
949/Pounds 950 level was an important chart point,' one said. 'Until then
people were selling into the market. Now they may be encouraged to cover
shorts and even go long.'

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Australia's coal-producers and mining unions yesterday agreed to a six-month
review of the nation's export coal industry in an attempt to identify the
main opportunities and impediments to its growth. Coal is Australia's
largest export category.
The study was announced by Mr David Beddall, the federal resources minister,
after a tripartite meeting between government, union and corporate
representatives, in Brisbane yesterday. The meeting had been called by Mr
Beddall after widespread outcry over the annual coking coal settlements
reached between producers and the Japanese steel mills earlier this year.
The contracts, which involved producers taking prices-cuts for the fourth
successive year, as well and reduced tonnages, and led to a six-day protest
strike by coal unions.
Yesterday, Mr Beddall admitted that there was 'a divergence of views on
necessary future action', but added that the industry had 'real prospects
for expansion, particularly in Asian markets'. He added that Japanese buyers
 -who take the lion's share of Australia's coal exports - would be welcome
to make submissions.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU beef stocks 'to fall
further'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European beef exports are expected to drop by over a fifth this year from
last, with another sharp decline in beef stocks to their lowest level in
five years, according to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Gatt's latest annual report on international meat markets says this should
lead to firmer world beef prices and increased export opportunities for
other producers, especially those of South America. The EU was the biggest
exporter last year, accounting for more than a quarter of the total, but is
expected to slip into second place behind Australia in 1994.
By the end of 1993, European Union beef stocks had shrunk to 600,000 tonnes
from 1.09m a year earlier, and they are forecast to drop to 360,000 tonnes
by the end of 1994. EU beef production, which fell 5 per cent last year, is
expected to stagnate or rise only marginally in 1994, with a bigger increase
predicted for 1995.
World beef and veal production declined by about 1 per cent in 1993 and may
rise by the same amount this year, Gatt says. Most central and eastern
European countries and the Commonwealth of Independent States have reduced
cattle herds because of rising production costs and falling domestic demand,
and further falls are likely this year. However, outside Europe, herd
numbers are rising.
World beef and veal consumption also fell last year, reflecting lower demand
in Europe and North America. However, consumption rose in several Asian
markets including Japan and South Korea which have recently liberalised beef
imports. World beef exports shrank by more than 4 per cent in 1993.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Government Bonds: European prices firm on hopes of monetary
easing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European government bonds put on a solid performance yesterday, closing more
than  1/2 point higher on renewed hopes for European monetary easing.
However, turnover was thin as continued uncertainty kept investors at bay.
'After the volumes we're seen recently, it felt like a Friday in August,'
said the chief trader at a US bank in London.
In addition to Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting - the last before the
central bank's Easter break - market participants are awaiting this week's
raft of key economic and inflation data in the UK and the US.
'No one wants to take positions ahead of numbers and events that can't be
predicted,' said Mr Andrew Roberts, a gilts analyst at UBS.
UK gilts were given an early boost by lower than forecast February producer
price data, which reignited hopes of another cut in base rates. However,
follow-through buying fizzled out, with most dealers reluctant to take on
large positions ahead of this week's data releases.
'The market didn't move much because everyone and his dog are waiting for
the retail sales number,' said Mr Roberts.
February retail sales figures are due to be announced tomorrow, along with
the February unemployment report, average earnings and unit wage costs. 'A
bullish retail sales number could really hurt the short end,' he added. 4
Moreover, dealers are nervous ahead of this week's US inflation data, which
some fear might prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten its monetary reins
again. US February PPI data are due to be released today and CPI is due
tomorrow.
The June long gilt future rose  1/2 point to close at 110.
German bunds ended the day just below their highs, supported by Friday's
public-sector wage settlement, upbeat comments from Bundesbank president
Hans Tietmeyer over the weekend and the moderate outcome of Sunday's
elections in Lower Saxony.
All eyes are on today's announcement of the Bundesbank's latest securities
repurchase agreements. Dealers were calling for another round of
variable-rate repos, with the minimum rate slipping another three to five
basis points from last week's 5.94 per cent.
'The D-Mark is strong against the dollar and we have had two very
encouraging wage settlements (in the engineering and public sectors) - this
should make the Bundesbank feel more confident on the inflation outlook,'
said Mr Stephen Hannah, head of research at IBJ International.
The June bund future on Liffe was up 0.57 points at 96.85 in late trading.
French bonds tracked bunds higher, shrugging off the Bank of France's
decision to leave its key intervention rate unchanged at 6.10 per cent.
The March notional bond futures contract on Matif rose 0.92 points to
125.56.
Italian bonds also strengthened slightly, with the June BTP future rising
some 0.75 points to 110.55. However, the market remains clouded by political
worries ahead of the March 27 - 28 elections and analysts say the Italian
10-year yield spread over bunds could widen further amid political jitters
from the current 320 basis points gap.
US Treasury bonds registered moderate losses yesterday as dealers turned
pessimistic ahead of February prices data to be released later in the week.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  13/32 lower
at 91 3/8 , with the yield rising to 6.936 per cent. At the short end, the
price of the two-year note slipped  3/32 to 99 11/32 , as the yield climbed
to 4.963 per cent.
The market opened on a weak note as traders failed to carry through on a
rare burst of buying during the final session of last week.
Many were betting that today's report on producer prices would spell more
trouble for the market, which has plunged in recent weeks on inflationary
fears and jitters over the direction of US monetary policy. February's
consumer price index, due out tomorrow, loomed as yet another obstacle.
Evidence of accelerating inflation in either report would support the view
that the Federal Reserve was poised to boost short-term interest rates for a
second time, perhaps after its March 22 policy-making session.
Against this backdrop, many traders chose to stay on the sidelines. Activity
remained light and tended to be on the selling side. No confidence was to be
derived from the day's only important economic news. The Federal Reserve of
Atlanta said its manufacturing diffusion index jumped last month, while the
prices-paid segment of the report showed a worrisome uptick.

FT  15 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: Japan tightens forex loss
disclosure rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's ministry of finance is to clamp down on the accounting practice by
companies whereby unrealised profits and losses on forward foreign exchange
transactions have been concealed.
From the business year starting in April, the ministry is to require
companies to disclose profits and losses which until now have not been
disclosed,
Japan's financial authorities have become increasingly concerned about the
large number of companies suffering from unrealised losses on forward
contracts on dollar purchases, due to the appreciation of the yen over the
past few years.
Many Japanese companies speculated in the foreign exchange markets during
the late 1980s and, rather than realising the losses and writing them off,
have extended such contracts in the hope that the yen's rise on the foreign
exchange markets would be reversed.
The decision will force corporate managers to curb foreign exchange deals
rolled over constantly to hide losses. The extent of such losses is not
clear, even to the financial authorities, but more Japanese corporations
have been forced to disclose their mounting losses recently as the yen has
strengthened further.
Showa Shell Sekiyu, the Japanese subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell, last year
reported an unrealised loss of Y166bn (Dollars 1.55bn), while Nippon Steel
Chemical, an affiliate of Japan's leading steel company, was forced to write
off Y14bn last September.
Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the business newspaper, estimates that unrealised
losses at Japan's listed companies total Y1,000bn but corporate reporting of
the unrealised losses, to start with the September six-month period, is
expected to reveal the true extent.

FT  15 MAR 94 / International Bonds: New Zealand FRN expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New Zealand is expected to raise Dollars 1bn in the Eurobond market today
through an offering of five-year floating-rate notes. Morgan Stanley and UBS
have been awarded the mandate. The discounted margin on the notes is likely
to be set at Libor less  1/8 .
Syndicate managers have been waiting for New Zealand to tap the Eurobond
market ever since the country's finance minister, Mr Bill Birch, visited
leading financial centres at the beginning of the month.
Mr Birch's international tour, the aim of which was to highlight New
Zealand's economic progress, came hard on the heels of news in late February
that Moody's, the international credit rating agency, had placed New
Zealand's Aa3 foreign currency debt rating on review for a possible upgrade.
Syndicate managers involved in the deal said the proceeds were likely to be
used to refinance New Zealand's maturing debt. Mr Birch told reporters in
Wellington yesterday that the government had decided not to cut its
NZDollars 4.45bn bond tender programme in 1993-94 because it had a large
amount of maturing debt to roll over this year.
However, Mr Birch added that surplus money raised by the programme would be
used to help repay New Zealand's NZDollars 66.7bn foreign debt, which he
said was too high.
L-Bank, the recently re-named state development agency of Baden-Wurttemberg,
is considering launching its first global bond offering later this week. The
deal will be lead-managed by Deutsche Bank, J. P. Morgan and Salomon
Brothers and will raise DM3bn. The borrower is thought to be leaning towards
a five-year maturity. L-Bank officials told investors recently that they
planned to raise Dollars 8bn out of a total annual funding programme of
around Dollars 10bn through four global bond offerings, denominated equally
in dollars and D-Marks.
Among yesterday's offerings, Ford Credit Europe took advantage of improving
conditions in the German government bond market to launch its first Eurobond
offering denominated in D-Marks. The five-year deal raised DM200m and was
priced to yield 50 basis points over five-year German government notes.
Lead manager Merrill Lynch said the yield spread compared favourably with
secondary market spreads on D-Mark Eurobonds issued by other motor
companies. For example, Volkswagen's recent five-year deal yielded 35 basis
points over German government notes, Merrill said. Ford's bonds remained in
syndicate overnight and were expected to appeal mainly to retail investors.
Elsewhere, the Republic of Austria was attracted by the aggressive funding
levels available in the Eurolira sector and raised L200bn through an
offering of 10-year Eurobonds. One syndicate manager familiar with the
Eurolira sector estimated that Austria had achieved a funding level of 70
basis points below lira-Libor but he added that the borrower would have had
to give up 10 basis points in order to swap the proceeds into dollars.
Lead manager Deutsche Bank said the bonds were sold into Germany and the
Benelux region and appealed to investors who believed the lira would
strengthen once the Italian general election was over.

<TEXT>
J. P. Morgan has emerged as the leading trading firm in impaired and
restructured secondary market debt, with turnover in 1993 of close to
Dollars 200bn, according to a market survey conducted by Risk magazine.
Many market participants reported increases in trading volume of more than
100 per cent, in a record year for emerging market debt trading.
American banks took the top five places in the survey, while Morgan
Grenfell, which topped the list last year, fell to sixth place with a
relatively modest volume increase of 60 per cent to Dollars 107.9bn.
Turnover in the market is estimated by traders at Dollars 1,000bn to Dollars
1,500bn, about three times the estimated size for 1992.
Continental Bank, Goldman Sachs and the Venezuela-owned VestcorPartners,
based in Miami, re-entered the rankings, while Banco Santander and MG
Emerging Markets, owned by Metallgesellschaft, the German oil and metals
group, fell out of the top 20. Metallgesellschaft is winding up its debt
trading operations following its recent heavy losses in derivatives trading.
J. P. Morgan also headed the list for emerging market options trading.

FT  15 MAR 94 / International Company News: Amoco plans restructuring to cut
costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amoco, the fifth largest US oil company, is considering a big internal
restructuring to reduce costs and raise its performance.
The plan would replace Amoco's three operating companies with leaner
business units, and reduce the corporate staff to a minimum. At the moment,
the operating companies, in production, refining and chemicals, represent
the core of Amoco's operations.
Mr Larry Fuller, Amoco chairman, told staff the restructuring would
eliminate much of the company's cost structure but there would also be a
significant transfer of personnel and a net loss of jobs throughout the
corporation.
He said it was too early to be specific about the impact of these changes,
but he hoped decisions would begin to be made by early summer.
The reorganisation follows the disappointing performance of Amoco stock
which lagged behind the Dow Jones Industrial Average last year.
The present three-company structure dates from the 1960s and has left Amoco
less competitive than it should be, Mr Fuller said.

FT  15 MAR 94 / International Company News: Kemper rebuffs GE Capital bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GE Capital, the fast-growing financial services arm of General Electric, has
had an uninvited bid of more than Dollars 2bn rebuffed by Kemper, the
Chicago-based fund management, life insurance and broking group.
News of the approach to Kemper emerged yesterday as GE Capital published
correspondence between the two companies over the past fortnight.
The all-cash offer, which GE Capital said was still open, would be for at
least Dollars 55 per Kemper share, representing a premium of 35 per cent on
the company's closing market price yesterday of Dollars 40 7/8 .
If successful, the bid would create one of the largest asset management
groups in the US, with nearly Dollars 150bn under management.
In a letter on March 2 to Mr David Mathis, Kemper chairman and chief
executive, Mr Jack Welch, chairman of General Electric, said that Kemper
would become 'the flagship of our major thrust in the asset management
business'.
The various asset management businesses in GE and GE Capital, with Dollars
75bn under management between them, would 'probably' be consolidated with
Kemper, Mr Welch said. The Chicago-based company had Dollars 70bn under
management at the end of last year.
The approach was rejected by Mr Mathis, who wrote back that 'a sale of the
company at this time is not in the best interests of our stockholders.'
GE Capital made the exchange of correspondence public yesterday in an
apparent attempt to put pressure on the Kemper board, rather than risk an
aggressive bid which would risk alienating senior Kemper staff. In his
letter, Mr Welch said that GE intended to keep Kemper's top management in
place.
Kemper is in the final throes of shaking off underperforming real estate
assets, which have held it back for much of the 1990s. GE said that it might
pay more than Dollars 55 a share for Kemper, pending a review of its real
estate assets.
According to Mr Samuel Liss, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, the benefits of
an overhaul at Kemper undertaken in the past two years, including an exit
from property/casualty insurance, are only now beginning to show through.
Last year, the company made operating profits of Dollars 108m, up from
Dollars 45m the year before, before accounting changes. However, troubled
real estate caused it to report an after-tax loss of Dollars 101m on
continuing operations.
Through a series of acquisitions, GE Capital has grown its revenues from
Dollars 16bn in 1991 to Dollars 22bn in 1993. It has won widespread respect
in the financial services industry for a successful, low-cost attack on a
number of niche markets, from car leasing to credit cards.

the fourth quarter of 1993 from Dollars 11.6m a year earlier on turnover of
Dollars 103.7m against Dollars 84.5m. Net earnings per share rose to 36
cents a share from 21 cents.
For the full year, net income rose to Dollars 19.3m from Dollars 4m on
turnover of Dollars 252.3m against Dollars 225m. Net earnings rose to 35
cents a share from 7 cents.
Auction sales for the year increased by 17 per cent to Dollars 1.3bn.
Auction operating revenues rose by Dollars 34.1m to Dollars 235m and auction
income before taxes to Dollars 34.2m from Dollars 4m.
North American auction sales rose by 19 per cent to Dollars 655m and
European auction sales by 18 per cent to Dollars 627.4m. It sold about

Financial services recorded pre-tax earnings of Dollars 2.8m, down from
Dollars 5.2m in the previous year because the loan portfolio was smaller.

FT  15 MAR 94 / International Company News: Advance in earnings at Swire
Pacific

<TEXT>
Swire Pacific, the Hong Kong-based property, aviation and trading group, saw
1993 profits improve by 5.4 per cent to HKDollars 4.66bn (USDollars 603m).
This follows a 43.5 per cent advance in net earnings in 1992.
Mr Peter Sutch, chairman, said the progress was achieved despite difficult
operating conditions in the airline industry and a significant reduction in
profits from the sale of investment properties in 1993.
Last week Cathay Pacific, Swire's 51.8 per cent-owned airline, reported a
23.8 per cent drop in profits largely on the back of recession in key
markets, especially Japan, and increased competition.
Group earnings, which were at the top end of analysts' expectations, were
lifted by the group's aviation units and strong growth in net rental
incomes.
Shareholders are to receive a dividend of 85 cents on the 'A' shares and 17
cents on the 'B' shares, increases of 10.7 per cent over 1992.
Swire's property division made a smaller contribution than previously,
chiefly because of the reduction in profits from the sale of investment
properties, which stood at HKDollars 396m last year and HKDollars 838m in
1992.
This year and next the property outlook will be enhanced by the group's
commercial developments in Quarry Bay and the sale of further residential
units in Robinson Place - both on Hong Kong Island.
The group says that it will continue to expand its property investment
portfolio, which was valued at HKDollars 56.18bn at the end of last year,
following last year's HKDollars 2.85bn site purchase with Citic Pacific.
The industries division turned in flat earnings, with gains offset by
exceptional losses at Taikoo Engineering and provisions for closure costs at
Swire Magnetics Holdings' manufacturing operations and Swire Duro's paint
factory, which has been replaced by a new operation with ICI in Guangzhou.

<TEXT>
China has consolidated the cream of its electronics industry into a single
consortium to meet foreign challenges after the country rejoins the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
The China Electronics Corporation (CEC), formed last week with assets of
Dollars 894m, draws together 62 subsidiaries into one company.
CEC will concentrate on micro-electronic and telecommunication products at
its plants around China. It plans to generate revenues of more than Dollars
2bn by the year 2000.
Electronics is regarded by Chinese government as one of its four 'pillar
industries' along with motor vehicles, machinery and construction. Revenues
from the electronics industry exceeded Dollars 20bn last year, occupying 5.2
per cent of the country's total industrial output.
China's re-entry into GATT, expected to take place within the next year or
so, would expose its fledgling electronics industry to potentially
devastating foreign competition under a lower tariff regime.
China's electronic exports reached Dollars 8.11bn in 1993, 18 per cent more
than 1992. Imports reached Dollars 10.6bn, an increase of 32 per cent over
the previous year.
Chinese officials expect the electronics industry to grow 20 per cent this
year, and exports to exceed Dollars 10bn.

FT  15 MAR 94 / International Company News: GIO says state bank purchase
unlikely
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GIO Australia, the Australian insurer privatised by the New South Wales
government in 1992, yesterday described itself as 'an unlikely end acquirer'
of the State Bank of New South Wales, the fifth-largest Australian bank
being auctioned off by the NSW authorities.
Mr Bill Jocelyn, GIO managing director, said that the acquisition of the
bank 'would make more sense to a foreign bidder than it does to us'. GIO, he
added, would be more interested in Suncorp, the Queensland-based financial
services business that may be sold off by the state government there.
GIO's comments came as it announced operating profit after tax and
extraordinary items of ADollars 93.9m (USDollars 66.7m) in the six months to
end-December, up from ADollars 42.9m in the same period in 1992. The figures
benefited from unrealised capital gains of ADollars 49.6m, the result of a
surge in share prices, compared with a loss of ADollars 2.4m in the same
period the previous year. Operating profit before tax was ADollars 131.5m,
against ADollars 72.8m last time.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The fallout from Poseidon Gold's speedy victory in the ADollars 287m
(USDollars 203m) takeover battle for Aztec Mining last week turned nastier
last night when PosGold's thwarted rival, Pancontinental Mining, sued the
winning bidder.
Pancontinental, which had made an all-paper bid for Aztec and seen its terms
initially recommended by the Aztec board, said that it had issued a writ in
the federal court alleging 'conspiracy to injure' and 'breach of section 615
of the Corporations Law'.
Last week, PosGold, which is part of Mr Robert de Crespigny's Normandy
Poseidon group, raised its cash offer to 74 cents a share. It then swept
into the stock market, acquiring the 37 per cent stake in Aztec held by
Alumax, the US group, and a large tranche of shares held by Bankers Trust
Australia. Other investors also quickly sold out to PosGold, with the result
that the bidder had secured over 85 per cent of its target's shares by the
close of the day's trading.
Pancontinental's board, however, said that events were 'of an unprecedented
nature and give rise to a number of serious legal issues'. The company added
that it was 'disturbed that it was offered no chance to renegotiate its
agreed merger'.
This, it claims, caused a 'very substantial loss' to Aztec shareholders.
Since securing control of Aztec, PosGold has questioned whether
Pancontinental is still obliged to go ahead with its bid - in which case,
PosGold directors have said they would consider the option of accepting on
behalf of PosGold's Aztec shares.
This would give PosGold a large minority interest in Pancon. Pancon has said
that it does not believe that it is required to proceed with the bid. A
court ruling is likely to decide the matter.

Fujitsu and Toshiba, two of Japan's leading electronics companies, plan to
invest in General Magic, a US company developing communication software for
multimedia.
The decision will help General Magic's software become the industry standard
for multimedia companies.
Matsushita and NTT have already invested in General Magic, hoping to be key
players in the market for products that combine the functions of computing,
telecommunications and data transfer.
The US company's telescript is a next-generation communications software
that allows users to send and receive data and computer programs, while
Magic Cap is a system software that provides an easy-to-use interface in
personal computers.
Last week Motorola became the first company to announce a product that will
use Magic Cap and Telescript. Fujitsu plans to introduce its first product
using the software in a year or two.

Hysan Development, the Hong Kong property investment company with a strong
presence in the office and shopping district of Causeway Bay, has surprised
analysts with a 53 per cent leap in net profits to HKDollars 1.5bn
(USDollars 194m) for 1993, up from HKDollars 980m previously.
Hong Kong's buoyant property market, with limited supply and strong demand,
led to big improvements in the office leasing market, while luxury homes saw
continued healthy demand. Rental levels on the retail side were firm, the
company said.
The company also unveiled a massive upgrade in its net asset value following
an independent revaluation of its properties and investments portfolios, to
HKDollars 36.41 per share against HKDollars 19.24 in 1992.
Directors are recommending a final dividend of 58 cents, up from 44 cents a
share the previous year.
Earnings per share rose 40 per cent to HKDollars 1.58 against HKDollars
1.13.

FT  15 MAR 94 / International Company News: Japanese banks try to get the
books in order - The hangover from the high-spending 1980s is greater than
was first estimated, and despite best efforts the government is worried it
could hurt recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the March financial year-end fast approaching, Japanese companies are
scrambling to spruce up their books in the face of the fourth consecutive
year of declining earn-ings.
The banks, many of which are busily trying to rid their balance sheets of
bad loans resulting from the reckless lending of the late 1980s, are no
exception.
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Japan's biggest bank in terms of assets, expects to
write off a total of Y700bn (Dollars 6.6bn) in problem loans this year and
next. Other banks are also accelerating write-offs, reflecting a policy
shift by the ministry of finance.
Initially the ministry had backed the traditional Japanese approach, urging
the banks to sit tight on high-risk loans until the economy recovered,
rather than making provisions. But it is clear that earlier estimates of the
extent of bad banking loans had been too low. Bad loans among the top 21
banks are now believed to total about Y30,000bn.
The ministry fears that economic recovery could be endangered if bad loan
exposure and consequent balance sheet strain forces the banks to curb new
lending.
The main vehicle helping banks confront their bad loans is the Co-operative
Credit Purchasing Company (CCPC). This was established by the banks last
March, after strong public opposition towards the government's suggestion of
using state funds to bail out the sector.
The banks sell their property-backed bad debt to the CCPC at a discount,
writing the difference off as an income loss. The CCPC, which buys a loan
with funds injected by the bank selling the loan, then tries to recover it,
in some cases selling the property collateral on the real estate market.
There are doubts about the extent to which the CCPC can ride to the banks'
rescue. At the end of February, it had bought Y2,857.1bn of bad debt from
the banks, but collected only 0.6 per cent of total loans purchased.
At the same time, the ministry is allowing the banks to set provisions at
their own discretion. According to IBCA, the UK bank credit rating agency,
resolving the problem could cost the leading 21 banks more than Y10,000bn,
assuming that a third of total problem loans need to be written off. Some
Y4,000bn is likely to be written off this financial year, leaving Y6,000bn
plus further increases in bad loans, which the agency expects will take at
least three to five years for the stronger banks to resolve.
Meanwhile, the ministry of finance is to allow banks to set up special
purpose companies, enabling them to shift 'restructured loans' - loans on
which banks have waived all or most of the interest to help restructuring -
to non-bank financial institutions.
During the past week, the ministry has put forward plans to allow banks to
set up subsidiaries which will buy land collateral at a court auction price.
In short, the banks will sell the land to themselves, while booking the loss
on the sale as a tax deduction.
But such plans, where banks fund separate entities to buy and warehouse the
bad or restructured loans and land collateral, leaves the financial
institutions vulnerable to a rise in interest rates. And while such schemes
will speed the write-off of bad loans, it will pose problems for investors;
the complex structure and the lack of transparency will make it virtually
impossible to assess the real risks banks face.
For example, when selling a bad loan to the CCPC, a bank will need to supply
the funds for the purchasing company to buy it. In effect, the bank is
changing a non-performing loan into a performing loan extended to the CCPC.
Mr David Marshall, of IBCA, says that such accounting practices deviate from
western standards and are far from prudent. Although bad loans may have been
shifted to the CCPC and losses written off, he points out that unless the
purchasing company can recover the loan, the ultimate risk will remain in
the hands of the banks.

<TEXT>
Sprint, the third largest US long-distance telephone company, has announced
plans to spend Dollars 350m over the next three years to double the capacity
of its 23,500-mile network, using advanced digital transmission technology.
The group said the upgrade would provide its customers with the ability to
send voice, video and data traffic over its network simultaneously at speeds
of up to 2.5 gigabits per second. A further upgrade to 10 gigabits per
second is planned as capacity demands increase.
Sprint said it had selected Alcatel Network Systems and NEC America to
provide synchronous optical network, or Sonet, transport equipment and
optical amplifiers to boost the capacity of its network.
Sonet equipment will be installed at each of the 338 locations where
Sprint's long-distance network connects with regional telephone services.
Sonet is the transport element of Sprint's broadband network design which
was announced in 1992. This also employs asynchronous transport mode
switching technology.

Sumitomo Rubber, Japan's third largest tyre manufacturer, yesterday reported
consolidated pre-tax profits down 68.6 per cent at Y4.93bn (Dollars 45.64m)
for the year ending December 31. Net profits fell 24.1 per cent to Y4.25bn.
The result underlined the continuing dire state of the Japanese tyre
industry which has been hit by falling demand, lower prices, and a
deteriorating product mix as consumers trade down to cheaper products.
The company also blamed the rise of the yen which had reduced the value of
overseas profits. Earnings per share dropped from Y33.77 to Y24.6.
The fall in profit was achieved on sales down 13 per cent at Y503bn.
The Japan Automobile Tire Manufacturers' Association recently reported that
demand from automotive manufacturers and consumers wanting to replace tyres
had fallen last year. Shipments to domestic vehicle constructors fell 12.1
per cent during 1993 to 50m units. Sales to the replacement market dropped
from 67.6m units in 1992 to 60.9m last year.
Sumitomo Rubber warned its net profit would fall further this year, reaching
only Y4bn. It predicted pre-tax profits would be static at Y5bn on sales of
Y530bn.
Earnings per share would also fall at Y24.41.
Mitsubishi is to take a 20 per cent interest in the new ADollars 70m
(USDollars 50.3m) methanol research plant which Broken Hill Proprietary
Petroleum, part of the Australian resources and steel group, is building in
Melbourne, writes Nikki Tait.
The plant is designed to research and develop forms of methanol-producing
technology, first developed by ICI Katalco in the UK.
'The joint venturers believe that methanol, which can be transported and
stored like other petroleum products, could be a cost-competitive fuel for
power generation,' said BHP yesterday.
BHP began building the plant last year, and it is about three-quarters
complete.

sale

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITT, the US conglomerate, took a further step towards narrowing its range of
activities as it announced a flotation for its ITT Educational Services
subsidiary.
The company said it planned to sell 19.9 per cent of the unit's shares, in a
move which analysts said would probably precede a full disposal.
The partial sale would be likely to put a higher value on the business than
that accorded it by ITT shareholders, said Mr Gary Schneider, an analyst at
Bear Stearns, the New York securities house.
It would prepare the unit for an eventual disposal by ITT, he said.
The educational services business has more than 20,000 full-time students
attending technical institutes in the US, and accounted for about Dollars
150m of revenues in 1992, the latest year for which figures are available.
The planned partial sale follows ITT's completion last month of the spin-off
of Rayonier, a forestry products company with annual sales of about Dollars
1bn.

Mr Lou Gerstner, chairman and chief executive of International Business
Machines, sees no quick fix for the computer company's financial woes. In
the annual report to shareholders, published yesterday, Mr Gerstner says
that IBM will recover 'over time'.
'It won't all happen overnight, but we are making significant progress,' Mr
Gerstner says in a letter addressed to 'Dear Fellow Investor'. He adds,
however, that 'you wouldn't know it from looking at the financial results
for the year (1993).'
IBM earlier reported net losses for 1993 of Dollars 8.1bn on revenues of
Dollars 62.7bn. In 1992 the company recorded a Dollars 5bn loss on sales of
Dollars 64.5bn.
Mr Gerstner charges that the company 'failed to keep pace with significant
change in the industry'. The company 'has been too bureaucratic and too
preoccupied with our own view of the world. We have been way too slow
getting new things to the market,' he states.
'We believe we can fix these problems because they are caused by us and not
factors outside our doors,' says Mr Gerstner, directly contradicting past
statements by senior IBM managers who blamed IBM's problems on economic
pressures and market turmoil.
In a remarkable reversal, Mr Gerstner, who last July stated that 'the last
thing IBM needs right now is a vision,' now believes that 'strategy is
particularly important for IBM'.
Mr Gerstner is expected to begin to reveal his strategies at an analysts
meeting later this month.
IBM's plans, announced last July, to reduce its workforce by 35,000 by the
end of 1995, are unchanged. 'Based on current business conditions, we think
that's about the right number,' Mr Gerstner says.
The annual report points to IBM's mainframe computers as the crux of its
problems. Revenue from mainframe computer hardware declined 27.6 per cent
last year, to Dollars 10bn, while personal computer sales increased 23.3 per
cent to Dollars 9.7bn.

public offering

Digital Equipment, the struggling US computer manufacturer, plans to raise
Dollars 500m through a public offering of 20m depositary shares priced at
Dollars 25 a share.
The company said proceeds would be used for working capital and other
general corporate purposes.
It recently announced plans to cut its European workforce by 20 per cent
with the loss of 6,000 jobs over the next 12 months.
Each depositary share represents a one-fourth interest in a Series A
cumulative preferred share.
For the six months to January 1 this year, Digital suffered a net loss of
Dollars 155.3m, compared with a loss of Dollars 334.4m in the same period a
year ago.
Digital has been struggling to come to grips with fundamental changes in the
computer market. These have shifted demand away from its mini-computers to
networks of much cheaper personal computers, and workstations, using 'open
systems' rather than proprietary software.
The dividend rate, redemption provisions and dividend payment dates of the
preferred stock will be established at the time of sale. The company said
the preferred stock would not be convertible.

FT  15 MAR 94 / International Company News: Film buffs trade on bad reviews
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Film reviews do not usually appear on the business pages of any newspaper.
But the weekend slating of Paul Hogan's latest production, Lightning Jack,
by New York critics is hot stock market news in Australia.
The reason: Lightning Jack was financed by Australia's first, and only,
publicly-quoted film trust.
Units in the trust are traded on the Australian stock market, and have
provided a punt on whether the archetypal Aussie movie-star would repeat the
success of his 1986 film, Crocodile Dundee, or whether Lightning Jack would
flop, like his subsequent 1990 film, Almost an Angel.
Yesterday, the critics' views outweighed some fairly healthy box office
returns from the film's opening weekend.
The units, sold to investors at ADollars 1 apiece last July, fell to
ADollars 1.15 at one stage yesterday morning, before recovering to around
ADollars 1.20 by mid-afternoon. That compares with ADollars 1.37 on Friday
night, and ADollars 1.85 in late February.
In Brisbane, Morgan Stockbroking, which underwrote the ADollars 35m issue of
units last summer, said there had been an early rush of panic phone calls,
but reactions had calmed by the end of the day.
Despite the poor reviews, the film reached number two at US box offices,
after Guarding Tess starring Shirley McLaine.
But whatever the eventual public verdict on Mr Hogan's 'comic western',
investors will not walk away empty-handed. The trust was structured so that
unitholders enjoy two years of tax breaks.
Investors who hold their units until June 1994 can write off 50 per cent of
their investment as a tax deduction in the current tax year. A further 50
per cent deduction will be allowed if the units are held until June 1995.
Thereafter, the value of the units will depend on how popular the film is.
Essentially, the unitholders own the copyright to the film for seven years
after its completion. After this, copyright switches to Mr Hogan's private
company, Lightning Ridge Films.
As revenues start to flow, Lightning Jack must first make deferred
production and marketing-related payments - including a Dollars 2m payment
to Mr Hogan, representing half his acting fee.
The next ADollars 35m goes to the unitholders, so that they recoup their
capital outlay. Further general expenses then have to be met, such as a
sales marketing fee. Finally, any residual revenues will be split 50:50
between Lightning Ridge and the unitholders.
But investors had a scare recently, when a question mark loomed over whether
the Australian Tax Office would agree to the full tax deductions originally
mooted.
In the event, these have been agreed. But the hiatus may have some bearing
on whether the Australian stockmarket houses any more film stocks. Mr Clarke
admits that in the light of the ATO's ruling, a precise replica of the trust
is unlikely, although he thinks variants might be attempted.

FT  15 MAR 94 / International Company News: Banks oppose Payless buyout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Dollars 1bn buy-out of Payless, the US drug store chain owned by Kmart,
has run into opposition from banks, threatening one of the biggest buy-outs
launched in the US since the 1980s.
The California-based Leonard Green &amp; Partners, which is leading the buy-out,
originally sought Dollars 850m from banks, in financing led by Bankers
Trust, Citibank and UBS.
Late last week, financing was scaled back to Dollars 600m, having already
been dropped to Dollars 750m, as a number of leading financial institutions
said they would not back the transaction.
To fill the gap left by the lower level of bank debt, the backers are now
planning to raise Dollars 600m through one of the biggest issues of
sub-investment grade bonds since the junk bond market sprang back to life a
year ago.
However, the bond issue comes at a time when mutual funds, which have been
the biggest supporters of the high-yield junk bond market, have experienced
a steady out-flow of cash. According to one estimate, investors have
withdrawn a net Dollars 1.5bn from high-yield fund in the past fortnight as
the US fixed income markets have fallen.
Leonard Green said the size of the bank deal had been scaled back in part to
enable the transaction to close by the end of this month. The firm added
that the three lead banks had fully underwritten the transaction, so the
financing for the deal was assured.
The head of syndication of one big US bank which has not backed the
transaction said: 'It's a very controversial deal - a lot of high-quality,
leveraged lending banks have said no.' Another leading bank added that the
difficulty in attracting cash showed that 'the market is not so over-heated
that anything will sell'.
One bank said that it had decided not to participate in part because
previous Leonard Green buy-outs had a poor track record.
The firm said, though, that only one of its buy-outs had resulted in Chapter
11 bankruptcy protection, that of Almac's, which sought protection from its
creditors last year.
'That's not a bad record in 20 years,' the firm added.
Until now, US buy-outs have been steadily increasing in size since the lull
in the early 1990s, which followed the failure of a buy-out at United
Airlines to attract bank finance.
Mr David Browning, managing director of structured finance at Citibank, said
the changes made to the proposed Payless financing did not mean that the
deal was in trouble.
'You make your best judgment (about the sources of finance). We have not
changed the debt structure, only the mix.'
A leveraged buy-out of Jefferson Smurfitt in the US has become the first
deal of the 1990s to attract more than Dollars 1bn of bank finance.
The buy-out has won backing from 13 banks, each of which has underwritten
Dollars 100m. Bankers in the US continue to predict a rash of big
bank-financed buy-outs.

Air Canada is seeking shareholder approval for a new class of non-voting
common shares to be used to raise equity, mainly outside Canada.
The company said it had no immediate plans to issue any of the new class A
non-voting common shares but it was creating the flexibility to obtain
foreign equity financing 'within the framework of the ownership restrictions
existing under federal legislation'.
At present, no individual can own more than 10 per cent of the voting
shares. Foreigners are restricted to 25 per cent.

FT  15 MAR 94 / International Company News: On the threshold of a third
phase - Asea Brown Boveri is looking for expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Percy Barnevik may court controversy with his opinions on thorny issues
such as western aid for the former Soviet Union, but he has always preferred
to hit the headlines by announcing good news from Asea Brown Boveri.
Last week, he wasted no opportunity to do so. Reaching the UK table on a
whistle-stop tour of a Copenhagen dining room, where journalists from 35
countries were tucking in at ABB's annual results shindig, Mr Barnevik
revealed with some pleasure that ABB UK had notched up the group's biggest
improvement in earnings last year.
The president and chief executive of Europe's largest electrical engineering
group is in confident, almost sprightly mood by his standards these days,
and not only because of the performance of ABB UK.
The entire group's pre-tax profits after financial items rose by 7 per cent
last year to Dollars 1.19bn, in spite of a 4 per cent fall in revenues to
Dollars 28.3bn. In dollar terms, that may not look too exciting - ABB's
pre-tax earnings have, after all, hovered around Dollars 1.1bn since 1990.
Mr Barnevik, though, sees a deeper meaning in the result than simply marking
the return to rising profits after a slight dip in 1992. For one thing, he
points out, profits expressed in local currencies rose by an average 25 per
cent on a 6 per cent increase in revenues, a better indication of underlying
trends.
More significantly for the long-term future of the company, its 206,000
employees and Europe's role in the world engineering industry, he believes
ABB is standing on the threshold of a new phase in its short corporate
history.
Phase one, from 1988 to 1990, saw the creation of the company from the
engineering interests of Sweden's Asea and Brown Boveri of Switzerland,
followed by heady growth and acquisitions in an expanding market.
Phase two, from 1991 to 1993, was one of consolidation and selected growth.
Amid deep recession in Europe and North America, 47,000 jobs were cut amid
restructuring and reorganisation in western countries. On the other hand
growth opportunities mainly in Asia and the former communist countries of
eastern Europe and, more recently the old Soviet Union, have added 35,000
new jobs.
The aim has been to exploit fast-growing new markets while laying the
foundations for profitable growth in western countries when they emerge from
the recession. This culminated last year with a reorganisation designed to
improve global co-ordination and efficiency, and a net Dollars 596m
non-recurring charge due mainly to restructuring in the second half of the
year.
Now, says Mr Barnevik, ABB has reached another turning point, and a third
phase - expansion - is beginning. With the recession over for practical
purposes, he says, ABB can go for growth and reap the benefits of
restructuring which will be completed by this autumn, and will save Dollars
200m in a full year.
Mr Barnevik may be one of Europe's most admired industrial strategists and
visionaries, but hard-nosed City analysts judge ABB by its financial
performance. By hitting the accelerator now, though, they believe he has
every chance to achieve the expansion profitably.
'If ABB can't deliver earnings growth after all their restructuring, it's
pretty well lights out for everyone else,' says Mr Russ Mould of S. G.
Warburg Securities.
Mr Barnevik is in sight of achieving a cherished financial target that
looked even beyond him two years ago - a 10 per cent operating margin
(return on operating profits after depreciation) and thus come closer to the
profitability of its big rival General Electric of the US.
The margin rose from 6.1 per cent in 1992 to 7.7 per cent last year, and Mr
Mould believes ABB could get very close to reaching 10 per cent within a
couple of years.
A lot more restructuring goes on behind the scenes, he says, than is
apparent from ABB's publicly announced reorganisation measures, such as the
1992 dismemberment of the old environmental services business segment.
There is also considerable scope for synergies, and hence savings in the
newly created power transmission and distribution segment and the biggest
new segment, industry and building systems, which employs nearly 86,000
people alone. Here, in particular, Mr Barnevik will be under pressure to
prove he has not created a conglomerate within a Leviathan.
Better market conditions in western markets will help lift profits but the
biggest contributions to earnings improvement will come from new markets.
The fact that ABB is already making good profits in countries such as Poland
and the Czech Republic is a hopeful sign for the future, says Mr Mould.
In the Asia Pacific region, ABB is trying to boost its already significant
presence - Dollars 3.6bn of sales last year - by becoming a true 'insider'.
In power transmission and distribution alone, for example, it has 20 plants
and plans another 23 over the next few years.
And it may not matter that all ABB's competitors - General Electric and
Westinghouse of the US, Siemens and GEC Alsthom from Europe - are doing much
the same, because the growth prospects are so mindboggling.
China, says Mr Barnevik, needs to increase its power capacity by 15,000MW to
18,000MW a year - compared with the 15,000MW built by Switzerland over the
past 100 years.

FT  15 MAR 94 / International Company News: Sales surge 21% at Schering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Schering, the Berlin-based drugs group, yesterday reported a 21 per cent
sales surge in the first two months of this year and forecast earnings for
the year would at least match last time's DM254m (Dollars 151m).
The sharp rise in turnover, together with an executive's remarks that the
profits forecast was made with 'typical understatement,' helped push the
group's shares up DM16 to DM1,036 in Frankfurt.
The group, a leading supplier of contraceptive pills, and which last year
won US approval for Betaseron, the first effective treatment for multiple
sclerosis, also announced a 1993 dividend of DM14.22, after DM13 last time.
The pay-out includes the benefits of recent changes in corporate taxes, and
with tax credits would yield a net DM20.31 a share - unchanged from last
year - for shareholders liable for German taxes.
Mr Klaus Pohle, finance director, said progress this year would depend on
the impact of exchange rates and health reforms, while the withdrawal of tax
concessions for companies based in Berlin would also affect results.
Earnings from Betaseron would not make a significant contribution to
profits, he added, blaming high development and launch costs. Sales of the
new product had so far failed to match expectations.
According to Mr Giuseppe Vita, group chairman, Betaseron added only DM7m to
group turnover last year. It was taking longer than expected for health
insurance companies to approve payment of potential patients' prescriptions.
Estimates of annual treatment costs range between Dollars 5,000 and Dollars
10,000.
Although only 4,000 US patients were taking the drug at the end of last
year, Mr Vita said he expected the number to climb to around 40,000 during
1994, bringing in sales of DM300m. Schering aims to start marketing the
treatment in Europe, where it will be called Beneseron, in mid-1995. An
application for approval will be sent to the Brussels authorities later this
year.

FT  15 MAR 94 / International Company News: Investor makes bid for
stablemate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Investor, the Wallenberg family's chief investment vehicle, yesterday
announced a bid worth SKr3.45bn (Dollars 440m) for its similar but junior
stablemate Export-Invest in a move that will strengthen the Swedish group's
capital base after a period dominated by retrenchment and recession.
The near deal between the companies - Export-Invest is also controlled by
the Wallenbergs and shares offices in Stockholm with the bidder - is based
on an issue of nine new Investor shares for every 10 Export-Invest shares.
It will raise Investor's net asset value by SKr3.8bn to SKr41.3bn and lift
Investor's solvency ratio from 55 per cent to 57 per cent.
The move follows an upturn in Investor's fortunes. Although pre-tax profits
slumped in 1993 to SKr410m from SKr1.48bn in 1992, there was a sharp rebound
in the fourth quarter based on a strong recovery at Saab-Scania, its
wholly-owned vehicle and aerospace group. Net debt also fell last year to
under SKr5bn from SKr8.7bn.
The bulk of Export-Invest's portfolio mirrors that of Investor, with
holdings in such Swedish blue-chips as Astra, the pharmaceutical group,
Stora, the forestry group, and Electrolux, the white-goods group. But
Investor said the acquisition of Export-Invest's holdings in foreign stocks
such as Roche, the Swiss pharmaceuticals group, and Alcatel Alsthom of
France, signalled a move to increase its investments abroad.
Mr Claes Dahlback, Investor chief executive, said he envisaged building up
foreign investments to 10 per cent of Investor's portfolio from levels
around 3 per cent after the Export-Invest takeover.
Executives of both companies went to some lengths to insist the deal was
fair to smaller shareholders, despite the lack of any cash alternative. The
offer represents a premium of 25.5 per cent on current market values of
Export-Invest's A shares.

FT  15 MAR 94 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft clears public
offering obstacle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TORONTO, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft has cleared an obstacle to a possible public offering of
its controlling interest in Metall Mining, the international mining arm of
the troubled German group. Metallgesellschaft's 50.1 per cent stake in
Metall Mining, which is listed on the Toronto stock exchange, is worth about
CDollars 530m (USDollars 389m).
The German group plans to sell the Metall Mining interest as part of its
efforts to recover from huge losses suffered in international oil trading
last year. However, the disposal is complicated by agreements between Metall
and its partners in various joint ventures,
under which the partners either have a right of first refusal on Metall's
stakes in their projects or a right to demand that the shares be transferred
back to Metallgesellschaft in the event of the German parent relinquishing
control of Metall.
Metall has, however, modified its agreement with Mr Norman Keevil, whose
family shares control Teck Corporation, the diversified Vancouver-based
mining group. Mr Keevil has relinquished his right to require
Metallgesellschaft to take over Metall's multiple-voting Class A shares in
Teck if the German company spins off its stake in Metall. In the event of a
third party taking control of Metall, Mr Keevil will acquire voting rights
over Metall's interest in Teck as well as the right to buy the shares
himself.
Metallgesellschaft has agreed to sell its 47 per cent stake in the
Kolbenschmidt car components company to Dana Corporation, a US components
group based in Toledo, Ohio, writes David Waller in Frankfurt.
The terms of the proposed sale were not disclosed. Kolbenschmidt, with 7,600
employees, is set to generate sales of DM1.1bn (Dollars 655m) in the current
business year, against the Dana group's DM8.6bn turnover.
The Kolbenschmidt holding was earmarked for disposal soon after Mr Kajo
Neukirchen took over as Metallgesellschaft chief executive in December. The
proposed sale follows the disposal of a number of smaller holdings, most
recently the CDollars 127m sale of a 6 per cent stake in Methanex, the
Vancouver-based company which is the world's biggest methanol producer.

DKr100m

<TEXT>
Bang &amp; Olufsen, the television and audio equipment manufacturer, said it
expects to return to profit for the first time after three years of losses.
It forecasts a pre-tax profit of DKr100m (Dollars 15m) for the year ending
on May 31 compared with a loss of DKr42.3m in the previous year.
The group has adjusted the forecast made in its half-year interim statement
in January, when it predicted profits for the full year of about DKr70m. The
performance has improved after a rationalisation programme was implemented
in the autumn of 1992 aiming at reducing costs, reorganising the European
sales and marketing operations, and introducing a cheaper range of
television sets.
First-half group sales were ahead by 18 per cent to DKr1.21bn from DKr1.03bn
and profits after net financial costs were DKr50m against a loss in the same
period of the previous year of DKr45m.
Sales in the second half of the fiscal year have exceeded expectations in
several of its European markets, including Denmark, Norway, Germany and the
Netherlands.

Hugo Boss, Germany's best known menswear manufacturer, yesterday raised its
annual dividend after reporting record profits of DM76.5m (Dollars 45.6m).
Ordinary shares will receive a DM23 dividend, up from DM21, while holders of
preferential stock will receive DM24.50, also up DM2.
The company, part of the Italian Marzotto group, said it was optimistic
about good cash-flow figures and predicted sales would recover after a fall
in turnover blamed on the recession. Overall group sales fell 7.8 per cent
to DM846.3m.

FT  15 MAR 94 / International Company News: Linde cuts payout as earnings
slide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Linde, the German engineering group, is to propose a DM1 cut to DM14 in its
dividend for 1993, following a 30.5 per cent fall in earnings to DM369m
(Dollars 220m).
The company, a leading supplier of fork lift trucks, industrial gases and
refrigeration equipment, said its materials handling divisions had been
worst hit by the recession.
Group sales fell 4.8 per cent to DM7.2bn last year, while incoming orders of
DM7.33bn were little changed, it said in a statement yesterday.
Linde, which earned record profits in 1992, consistently warned of a
downturn for most of last year, reporting a 26 per cent contraction in the
European fork lift truck market in the first six months. Profits at the
German parent, Linde AG, fell 22.5 per cent to DM150m. The workforce was cut
by 2.6 per cent during the year.

FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Research costs leave Scotia loss at Pounds
6.35m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scotia Holdings, the drugs company built on sales of evening primrose oil,
yesterday reported buoyant demand for existing products along with its first
figures since its October flotation.
Sales for the year to December 31 rose 9 per cent to Pounds 15.2m in 1993,
boosted by a new UK distribution agreement and the re-entry of its
nutritional products into the US market. Operating profit slipped 8 per cent
to Pounds 5.92m before research and development spending of Pounds 8.52m, up
11 per cent.
After a net Pounds 3.8m exceptional debit, covering items referred to in the
prospectus, there was a pre-tax loss of Pounds 6.35m, up from Pounds 839,000
in 1992.
Scotia's research focuses on lipids, important constituents of the membranes
which surround cells, an area which has been largely ignored by the
pharmaceuticals industry.
However Mr David Horrobin, founder and chief executive, said the level of
interest in lipid technology was increasing very quickly.
He pointed to the fact that 22 hospitals around the world had now applied to
enrol patients in phase III trials of Scotia's EF13 compound for use in
treatment of pancreatic cancer. 'Everyone seems to want to join the trial
and there is a feeling that something very exciting is happening.'
Scotia's most advanced product, for complications of diabetes, is in phase
III trials with 700 patients.
Last year's flotation raised a net Pounds 37m, rather more than originally
planned, and Mr Horrobin said this had enabled the company to push ahead
faster than expected with some of its less advanced products. These include
compounds aimed at rheumatoid arthritis and angioplasty, which have just
started phase III trials.
There was a loss per share of 12.5p. The shares, which were offered at 290p,
reached a high of 323p shortly after the flotation before falling back below
the issue price. Yesterday they added 10p to 255p.
COMMENT
Despite the initial enthusiasm which accompanied its flotation, Scotia has
since received relatively little serious attention in the City. This may
stem partly from its maverick focus on lipid technology and the 'new age'
aura which surrounds its evening primrose products. But the recent trial
results, particularly in inoperable pancreatic cancer, suggest it is on to
something and if some of its new products do make it to market its
pioneering status makes the potential upside all the greater. It has a very
powerful patent position and most of its products are aimed at diseases for
which there is little or no existing drug treatment. Its compounds also tend
to show few side effects which lessens the chance of them failing the phase
III trials. The shares are clearly speculative but they have a more
attractive mix of risk and reward than many in the sector.

FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Acquisition helps lift ISA to Pounds 4.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISA International, the computer equipment distributor, reported a 57 per
cent increase in profits following a strong performance by its new
Scandinavian subsidiary.
A Pounds 668,000 contribution by CTS Svenska, acquired for Pounds 3.6m in
February last year, lifted pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.3m in the 12 months
to December 31, against Pounds 2.7m in 1992.
The comparative figure was restated using average currency conversion rates
rather than year-end figures to calculate overseas profits.
After stripping out CTS Svenska's gains and a Pounds 236,000 downward
re-adjustment of the 1992 results, the group saw underlying profits grow 33
per cent to Pounds 3.6m
Mr John Parkinson, chairman, said the improvement reflected a new emphasis
on direct sales rather than dealer distribution.
The move helped operating profit increase to Pounds 4.7m (Pounds 3.38m),
while turnover rose 24 per cent to Pounds 140m (Pounds 113m).
Having initiated that strategy, however, Mr Parkinson announced his
retirement to make way for 'someone with more experience of strategic
marketing'.
Signalling a shift in the overall direction of the group, he added: 'The
company would benefit from a change in operational leadership. We'd like to
see further improvement from some subsidiaries and new products introduced.'
His fellow directors are understood to have been surprised by his decision,
which follows a lengthy review of ISA's performance.
The review persuaded the board to invest Pounds 4m on a new computer system
designed to cut costs and offset the effect of tighter margins in Europe.
Mr Parkinson hinted that ISA was also considering further acquisitions,
which would be funded from reserves of Pounds 3.4m left over from its Pounds
7m placing and offer to acquire CTS Svenska.
Earnings per share rose 35 per cent to 7.46p, against a restated 5.52p. A
final dividend of 1.1p makes a 1.65p (1.5p) total.
The shares closed up 5p at 136p.

FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Costain Pounds 68.7m in the black - Balance
sheet back in shape after Australian coal mining disposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Costain Group, the construction and mining group which was seriously
threatened during the recession, bounced back into the black with pre-tax
profits of Pounds 68.7m for 1993.
That compared with losses of Pounds 204.6m for the previous year. The
directors said , however, that trading conditions remained difficult and
that it was unlikely dividend payments would be resumed before 1995.
All but Pounds 200,000 of last year's profits was raised from the sale of
the group's Australian coal mining business to Peabody, part of Hanson, the
industrial conglomerate.
The sale, together with proceeds from last autumn's Pounds 83.9m rights
issue, enabled Costain to reduce net debt from Pounds 331m to Pounds 83m
taking gearing down to 37 per cent of increased shareholders fund of Pounds
228m.
Interest costs, however, rose from Pounds 18.9m to Pounds 22.1m due mainly
to the strengthening of the US dollar and bringing off-balance sheet loans
on to the balance sheet. Mr Peter Costain, chief executive, said interest
payments should fall sharply in the current year when the group would have
the benefit of sale and rights issue proceeds for a full 12 months.
Nonetheless, borrowings were likely to rise again this year due to the
timing of capital investment in the US, payments to US sub-contractors and
spending on the Spitalfields development in London. Borrowings were expected
to fall sharply again in 1995.
Turnover on continuing activities remained static at Pounds 1.1bn (1.17bn)
while earnings per share recovered to 18.8p (losses 84.6p), including profit
on disposals.
In addition to its financial achievements, the group also increased
operating profits.
Engineering and construction made profits of Pounds 14.7m (Pounds 5.3m
deficit) on a reduced turnover of Pounds 808m (Pounds 934m).
Almost two-fifths of the group's construction order book is for higher
margin overseas work, of which about half is in Hong Kong where the group is
involved in the construction of the new airport and the Tsing Ma bridge.
US coal mining also reported improved profits which rose from Pounds 6.1m to
Pounds 8.3m. Severe winter weather, however, had meant that the business had
got off to a poor start in the first few months of this year.
COMMENT
Costain, having got its balance sheet back in shape, has made no secret of
the fact that it faces another tough trading year. Forecasts for 1994
profits will not have been improved by warnings of a poor start by US coal
and a slowdown in the rate at which international construction orders are
being won. Meanwhile, gearing could climb to more than 50 per cent this year
before getting back to nearer 30 per cent in 1995. Group profits for 1994
may be no more than Pounds 6m-Pounds 8m. Analysts are looking for no more
than Pounds 15m in 1995 but this could rise further if Costain's investment
to improve coal mining productivity starts to pay off. The stock has been
through too much to start recommending it now on the basis of jam tomorrow.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Abtrust Lloyd's Insurance Trust, one of the trusts set up to take advantage
of the acceptance of limited liability capital, has taken underwriting
commitments of Pounds 38.3m for the 1994 year of account.
The trust said that it had taken a cautious approach and the commitments
represented 66.8 per cent of its overall premium limit as allowed by
Lloyd's.
Its exposure follows the average for the Lloyd's market except for being
above average in non-marine property loss or damage and non-marine general
liability and slightly below average for aviation and personal accident.
For the 1995 year it is looking to achieve underwriting up to its limit.
The information came with a report of results from its incorporation on
August 25 to November 30 showing net revenue of Pounds 19,560 and net asset
value per share at the end of the period of 95.18p.
It was granted corporate membership of Lloyd's from January 1. Its next
reporting period will be the 16 months to March 31 1995.
The net Pounds 28.7m proceeds of the public issue has now been invested
resulting in a net asset value of 95.9p at February 28.

Automagic Holdings, the shoe retailer and key cutter, more than doubled
pre-tax profits from Pounds 76,000 to Pounds 163,000 in the 28 weeks to
January 8, on a reduced turnover of Pounds 6.01m, against Pounds 6.38m.
The company attributed the improvement to greater efficiency at controlling
overheads. It had also reorganised field operations management in readiness
for expansion.
The directors were confident that 'the out-turn for the year as a whole will
prove to be another positive milestone'.
A programme of further resiting and opening of new branches was well under
way, some of which would be completed by the year end. Further disposals
were planned, several of which were well advanced.
Interim earnings per share were up by 1p to 1.9p. There was again no interim
dividend.

FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Calderburn 25% lower at Pounds 2.1m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Calderburn, the Preston-based office furniture group, returned pre-tax
profits of Pounds 2.1m for 1993, a 25 per cent shortfall on the previous
year's Pounds 2.83m.
The 1993 figure took account of non-recurring costs of Pounds 400,000, but
excluded any contribution from Specialised Banking Furniture International,
acquired on December 29.
Turnover improved from Pounds 25.9m to Pounds 26.7m. Earnings emerged at
5.7p (7.4p) but 'reflecting confidence in future prospects' the total
dividend is held at 7.7p via a proposed final of 4.9p.
The directors said there had been a strong start to the year across the
group with order intake for the opening two months well ahead of the
comparative period of 1993.
They added that a continuation of the current trends would lead to an
improved performance for the first half.
The enlarged factory at Altham will be completed on schedule in July and
directors stated that it would be within the budgeted cost of Pounds 4m.

FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: BSM tops flotation profit forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BSM Group, the owner of the British School of Motoring which was floated
last October, increased both operating profits and turnover by 12 per cent
for the year to the end of December.
Operating profits rose from Pounds 4.11m to Pounds 4.63m, just ahead of the
Pounds 4.55m forecast in the prospectus. Turnover rose from Pounds 21m to
Pounds 23.6m.
Mr Paul Massey, chief executive, said the company was delighted to have
beaten its profit forecast. After clearing about Pounds 30m of debt with the
proceeds of the flotation, the group was in a good financial position for
the future, with a strong balance sheet and high cash generation.
At the pre-tax level profits were Pounds 1.02m, after paying net interest of
Pounds 3.77m. That compares with a loss of Pounds 528,000 for 1992 after
paying net interest of Pounds 4.69m.
A high tax charge of Pounds 698,000, or a little less than 70 per cent,
depressed earnings per share to 2.2p, compared with losses of 10.2p last
time. From now on the group expects a constant tax charge of about 25 per
cent as it takes advantage of capital allowances on its fleet of 2,000 cars.
The group said pro-forma pre-tax profits were Pounds 4.47m, up from a
pro-forma Pounds 4.06m for 1992. With tax at 25 per cent, pro-forma earnings
were 11.8p (10.7p). The pro-forma net interest payment was Pounds 154,000,
compared with Pounds 45,000.
As forecast in the prospectus, this year's interim dividend will be the
first to be paid, but the company estimated a pro-forma dividend of 5.78p
for 1993.
BSM is the UK's biggest driving instruction company, operating 134 branches
and 2,000 franchised instructors. It said the decline in the UK market,
which has been in double figures, levelled out last year, falling just 2 per
cent. BSM's own business rose by 4 per cent.
The group also operates a health and safety division, which provides
training to company car drivers, and MCR, its maintenance arm which is
expanding beyond BSM's own fleet. These two accounted for 10 per cent of
turnover.

FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Productivity gains boost Greggs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greggs, the baker, reported a very good 1993, with pre-tax profit up 29 per
cent to Pounds 9m for the 53 weeks to January 1, against Pounds 6.97m for
the 52 weeks to December 26 1992.
Turnover rose 9.3 per cent to Pounds 110.4m (Pounds 101m), or 8 per cent
adjusting for the effect of the extra week.
The company said an improvement in its pre-tax margin from 6.9 per cent to
8.2 per cent reflected productivity gains and improved energy efficiencies.
Earnings per share were up 30 per cent to 53p (40.6p).
A proposed final dividend of 12p makes a total of 18p (15p), an increase of
20 per cent
In January, Greggs opened its 500th shop and plans to add a net 20 outlets
this year. 'We're the biggest retail bakery company in Britain and the most
profitable,' said Mr Mike Darrington, managing director.
During 1993 its London business, acquired in 1987 and since expanded, moved
into profit for the first time.
All other divisions improved their performances and profitability, with
Scotland showing the best profit increase.
Net cash stood on January 1 at Pounds 12m. This year Greggs is investing
Pounds 14m including Pounds 8m on two new bakeries in London and Birmingham.
Allowing for this investment programme, financed from cash reserves, it
anticipates having net cash of between Pounds 6m and Pounds 7m by the end of
this year.
Mr Darrington forecast a very satisfactory improvement in profitability for
the first half of the present year.
The investment programme was likely to mean slower profit growth in the
second half and early 1995.
However, its prime aim, he said, was to enhance the quality and enjoyability
of Greggs' products.
Britain, he thought, placed too much emphasis on efficiency and too little
on making products people wanted to buy.
'I see more talk about getting unit costs down than about making excellent
products.
'If they are not going to enjoy the product, it does not matter how cheap I
make it.'

FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Ashanti's flotation valued at Pounds 1.67bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ashanti, one of the world's biggest gold mines, will have a market
capitalisation of up to Pounds 1.67bn after its flotation.
Yesterday the Ghanaian Government offered 17.9m shares in Ashanti Goldfield
Company, or just over 22 per cent. The price is expected to be between
USDollars 17 and USDollars 20 a share.
Ashanti, which reported profits after tax of USDollars 90.2m for the year to
end September, is seeking listings on the London and Ghana Stock Exchanges.
The company is also offering for subscription 3.5m new shares, or about 4.4
per cent.
The offer is intended to raise between USDollars 290m and USDollars 340m for
the Ghanaian Government after expenses, and between USDollars 47m and
USDollars 57m for Ashanti. After the offer the Ghanaian Government will own
around 31 per cent of Ashanti. Lonrho, which has a 45 per cent stake and is
not selling any shares, will have about 43 per cent of the enlarged share
capital.
Mr Sam Jonah, Ashanti chief executive, described the flotation as 'the
largest step in the Government of Ghana's economic liberalisation and
privatisation programme.'
Ashanti, which expects to produce over 1m ounces of gold in 1994-95, will
use the proceeds for working capital, to help finance capital expenditure
and for increased exploration. The group's net debt at January 31 was
USDollars 148.6m.
The Ghanian offer is expected to close on April 6, and the international
offer on April 18.

FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Textile rentals and currency gains boost
Johnson Cleaners to Pounds 18.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Johnson Group Cleaners, the largest dry cleaning group in the UK and US,
announced a 20 per cent jump in pre-tax profits helped by currency gains and
steady growth in its textile rental operation.
Mr Terry Greer, chairman, retained his usual cautious outlook in spite of
the increase, with warnings that the outcome for the current year was far
from certain. Trading had declined in the first few weeks.
'People are still nervous, waiting for the tax increases in April to hit
their pay packets,' Mr Greer said.
Business had also suffered from harsh winter weather in both the US and UK.
Such concerns had not been apparent in the 12 months to December 25, when
Johnson achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds 18.2m (Pounds 15.1m) on sales 10
per cent ahead at Pounds 165.2m.
The advance was achieved after interest charges were halved to Pounds
814,000 and was also helped by a 15 per cent improvement in the average
dollar/sterling exchange rate.
The strongest profits advance came from textile rental, with a 15 per cent
jump at the operating level to Pounds 10.1m on sales 10 per cent ahead at
Pounds 45.1m. The profits increase included a better than expected Pounds
505,000 contribution from Imperial and Queen Laundries, the textile rental
business acquired in January.
This division improved profits both in the US and UK. Mr Greer said this was
partly due to a greater focus on the more hygienically stringent food
processing industry and partly due to 'early signs of increased demand'.
The dry cleaning division remained difficult in both markets, with
franchising in the US continuing to make losses. Operating profits were
largely flat at Pounds 8.9m on sales 9 per cent higher at Pounds 120m.
Johnson Group also announced plans for a capital reconstruction aimed at
improving the marketability of the shares. The company proposes to subdivide
the 25p shares and consolidate them into ordinary shares of 10p each.
The final dividend was increased by 7 per cent to 20p, for a total pay-out 5
per cent higher at 27p. Earnings per share were 62.01p (49.4p) basic or
59.23p (48p) fully diluted.
COMMENT
There is a risk with Johnson Group of endlessly repeating the same story.
Yet there is little to add while discretionary spending remains stubbornly
depressed. Johnson does extremely well to hold dry cleaning profits and even
better to build a textile rental division through the ravages of recession.
When the eventual upturn comes - and only then - Johnson is expected to show
substantial improvements. Forecasts of Pounds 19m for this year put the
shares on a prospective p/e of about 17. While this may be up with events in
the short term, those punting on longer term growth are unlikely to be
disappointed.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GKN, the engineering group, has won shareholders' approval to go ahead with
its bid for Westland, the helicopter group of which it already controls 44.8
per cent of the equity.
GKN's 290p a share bid is handled by SG Warburg and values Westland at
Pounds 497m.
Sir David Lees, GKN chairman, told an extraordinary general meeting in
Birmingham that proxy returns showed a majority of shareholders were in
favour of the bid.
The meeting, attended by about 40 people, voted unanimously for the bid, for
the increase in the authorised capital necessary to accommodate the proposed
takeover, and for the rights issue which will help to finance it.
The rights issue would raise Pounds 248m in two instalments through the
issue of con-vertible unsecured loan stock.
The offer, GKN executives believe, has now come down to a straight issue of
price.

FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Profits ahead of forecast at Pounds 14.9m
and south-east targeted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Takare, the nursing home group, is targeting the south-east of England for
new development. More than half the beds now under construction are in the
south-east. At present only two of the group's 39 homes are in the area.
Mr Keith Bradshaw, chairman, said that the Community Care Act, which came
into effect nearly a year ago, had resulted in greater differences between
fee rates in different regions. This made it possible to generate the same
return from a home in the south-east as elsewhere.
Mr Ron Reid, finance director, said that Takare's fee rates in the
south-east averaged Pounds 340 a week, compared with Pounds 285 elsewhere,
which would cover higher wage rates and land prices.
The group beat its rights issue profit forecast of at least Pounds 14.8m in
1993, recording pre-tax profits up from Pounds 11.8m to Pounds 14.9m,
including a Pounds 371,000 exceptional profit on the sale of a nursing home.
Earnings per share were 13.7p (12.1p), or 13.3p excluding the exceptional
profit, and a final dividend of 1.4p is proposed, as forecast, to give a
total of 2.07p (1.8p).
Turnover growth was 52 per cent, from Pounds 48m to Pounds 72.8m, largely
reflecting the rise in the number of beds the group had in operation, with
prices rising only about 2 per cent. Operating profits were 59 per cent
higher at Pounds 17.4m (Pounds 10.9m).
However, interest payable of Pounds 2.8m (receivable Pounds 941,000), after
capitalising Pounds 2.39m (Pounds 4.16m), held back the pre-tax profits
growth. Takare received the Pounds 68m rights proceeds in mid-November.
At the year end the group had net cash of Pounds 10.1m. However, Pounds 50m
of debentures pay interest at 11.8 per cent while its cash deposits earn
less than half that.
Capital spending dipped to Pounds 33.6m (Pounds 40.9m) in 1993 as Takare
delayed new construction while the community care reforms were implemented.
During 1993 the group added 2,295 beds to take its total to 5,340 at the
year end, with another 1,290 under construction. This year capital
expenditure of about Pounds 50m is expected, with 1,500 to 1,800 beds under
construction.
Mr Bradshaw said following the rights issue, Takare was able to fund a
greater proportion of its development from internal resources, and would not
contemplate joint ventures or sale and leasebacks to pay for expansion.
COMMENT
Aside from the unfortunate management wrangle, and the question over Mr
Pritchard's shareholding, the Takare story has not changed. Indeed, the move
south-eastwards is to be welcomed. However, following the rights and with a
rising tax charge, earnings growth will be dull this year, to be resumed
next. On forecasts ofabout Pounds 21m pre-tax, the prospective p/e is in the
region of 18 1/2 with the shares down 8p at 266p. After a good run post the
rights, which came at 195p, the shares should mark time for a while.

FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Efficiency gains help Greggs rise 29%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greggs, the baker, reported a very good 1993, with pre-tax profit up 29 per
cent to Pounds 9m for the 53 weeks to January 1, against Pounds 6.97m for
the 52 weeks to December 26 1992.
Turnover rose 9.3 per cent to Pounds 110.4m (Pounds 101m), or 8 per cent
adjusting for the effect of the extra week.
The company said an improvement in its pre-tax margin from 6.9 per cent to
8.2 per cent reflected productivity gains and improved energy efficiencies.
Earnings per share were up 30 per cent to 53p (40.6p). A proposed final
dividend of 12p makes a total of 18p (15p), an increase of 20 per cent
In January, Greggs opened its 500th shop and plans to add a net 20 outlets
this year. 'We're the biggest retail bakery company in Britain and the most
profitable,' said Mr Mike Darrington, managing director.
During 1993 its London business, acquired in 1987 and since expanded, moved
into profit for the first time. All other divisions improved their
performances and profitability, with Scotland showing the best profit
increase.
Net cash stood on January 1 at Pounds 12m. This year Greggs is investing
Pounds 14m including Pounds 8m on two new bakeries in London and Birmingham.
Allowing for this investment programme, financed from cash reserves, it
anticipates having net cash of between Pounds 6m and Pounds 7m by the end of
this year.
Mr Darrington forecast a very satisfactory improvement in profitability for
the first half of the present year. The investment programme was likely to
mean slower profit growth in the second half and early 1995. However its
prime aim, he said, was to enhance the quality and enjoyability of Greggs'
products.
Britain, he thought, placed too much emphasis on efficiency and too little
on making products people wanted to buy. 'I see more talk about getting unit
costs down than about making excellent products. If they aren't going to
enjoy the product it doesn't matter how cheap I make it.'

Pounds 2.7m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Porter Chadburn, the packaging and consumer products group, has entered into
a conditional agreement to dispose of two subsidiaries, Sportline and TPL
Marketing, to H Young Holdings for about Pounds 2.7m in cash.
Sportline distributes Head sports equipment and luggage to the mail order
and retail trade in the UK while TPL sells a variety of products into the
promotional and incentive markets. In the 12 months to April 2 1993 the two
offshoots incurred operating losses of Pounds 152,000.
The disposals represent the first steps of the strategy of disposing of
businesses which do not meet the group's financial criteria.
H Young, the Henley-based purchaser, is a marketing and distribution
company. Completion is scheduled for March 31.

FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Anglo Utd sells Charringtons Fuel business
for Pounds 41.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anglo United, the heavily indebted fuels group, yesterday announced the sale
of its Charringtons Fuel business to management in a venture capital-backed
deal worth Pounds 41.5m.
Anglo will receive Pounds 30m, reducing the core bank debt to less than
Pounds 100m. Last year the group reported negative shareholders funds of
Pounds 145.1m.
Mr John Gainham, managing director of Anglo, said the group had investigated
other options for Charringtons such as a trade sale, but management had come
up with the best offer.
The managment team is led by Mr Howard Birtwistle, Charrington's chairman
and a former director of Shell UK Oil. The team is backed by a syndicate
headed by 3i, the venture capitalist group. The syndicate will provide
Pounds 16.5m of equity finance, while debt and working capital facilities of
Pounds 25m will be funded by Chemical Bank and the Royal Bank of Scotland.
Management is investing about Pounds 200,000 and will hold some 22.5 per
cent of the equity. An employee trust will hold a further 2.5 per cent.
Mr Birtwistle said there were opportunities to expand Charrington's market
share.
Mr Gainham said Anglo could not afford to invest in Charringtons. The
disposal would free Anglo to more than double its capital investment in its
coal businesses from Pounds 2m to Pounds 5m in 1994-95.
Mr Gainham said he was confident Anglo would improve its performance this
year, after 1993's Pounds 30m pre-tax loss. However, there was considerable
uncertainty given the lack of direction on the future of British Coal, for
which Anglo once hoped to bid.

FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Persimmon calls for Pounds 49.2m - Latest
to join growing list of share issues from UK housebuilders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Persimmon yesterday joined the growing list of UK housebuilders to announce
share issues to finance land purchases and take advantage of the housing
market recovery.
The company is raising Pounds 49.2m in an underwritten right issue by
offering shareholders shares at 282p apiece on a 2-for-11 basis.
Persimmon also announced a 96 per cent jump in 1993 pre-tax profits to
Pounds 18.6m. Earnings per share doubled from 6.8p to 13.7p. The dividend
for the year is raised from 8.6p to 9.2p, with a 6.2p final.
The group's share price slipped from 337p to 333p following the rights issue
announcement.
Housebuilders by this spring will have raised substantially more than Pounds
1bn from rights issues, share placings and flotations since the beginning of
last year. Some of this money has been used to repair balance sheets but a
good proportion has been set aside to acquire land.
To support sales of 4,000 homes a year by the mid-1990s, compared with 2,973
sales last year, Persimmon says it will need to increase the number of plots
owned with planning permission from 15,200 to 20,000.
The effect of the issue would be to leave the group with virtually no debt.
Borrowings, however, would be expected to rise as land buying and output
increased.
Mr Duncan Davidson, chairman, said: 'Depending upon the strength of the
market we would be comfortable with gearing of between 30 per cent and 40
per cent indicating net debt of up to Pounds 80m at our present size.'
He added the group had usually financed land purchases out of shareholders
funds, leaving work in progress to be financed by borrowings. He and his
wife Sarah, are not taking up their rights, reducing the family holdings
from 19.4 per cent to 16.4 per cent.
Persimmon said that recovery in the housing market was continuing with
forward orders, including reservations, more than 10 per cent higher during
the first ten weeks of this year than the corresponding period last.
Prices had also risen a little. The average price of a home was currently
about Pounds 64,000, compared with Pounds 61,000 last year. Part of this
increase was due to change in product mix but some of it was due to a
genuine rise in prices.
Turnover in 1993 increased from Pounds 140.6m to Pounds 169.3m.
COMMENT
The latest cash call by Persimmon on its shareholders is a little bit
cheeky. Since the end of 1990 the number of Persimmon shares in issue will
have risen by 49 per cent from 77.8m to 116.1m following the latest rights
issue. The offer price is at a sufficient discount to be attractive to
shareholders and the rights should be taken up. Persimmon's net margins have
climbed to more than 10 per cent after interest and are better than many of
its competitors. Nonetheless, some of the gloss has gone off the company as
it has embarked on an ambitious expansion programme. A pre-tax profit of
Pounds 27m for the current year puts the group on 19 times earnings which is
probably high enough.

Dairygold, the private Irish dairy and meat processor, has acquired Horlicks
Farms and Dairies, a Somerset-based cheddar cheese manufacturer, for Pounds
21.4m. The sum includes Pounds 7m of debts which Dairygold will assume.
Horlicks was acquired from SmithKline Beecham in 1989 in a management
buy-out, and currently produces some 5,000 tonnes of Cheddar cheese per
annum, which is exported throughout the EU. Turnover for the year to March
1993 was Pounds 20m.
The current management team of Horlicks, headed by Mr Stephen Curtis, the
managing director, is to be kept in place.
Mr Dennis Lucy, chief executive of Dairygold, said the acquisition was, 'an
important part of our strategy to develop our dairy business throughout
Europe'.

FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Takare founder ousted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ferocious boardroom row over management style at Takare ended last Friday
afternoon when Mr Deverok Pritchard, one of the group's founders, was
stripped of his executive duties. He was managing director and deputy
chairman and is likely to receive compensation of about Pounds 130,000.
However, Mr Pritchard, 52, appears to have dug his heels in remaining a
non-executive director and can only be removed by a vote of shareholders. He
holds 12.8m shares, 10.2 per cent of the total and was not available to
comment either on his removal from office or any plans to sell the shares.
Mr Keith Bradshaw, chairman, who set up Takare with Mr Pritchard 14 years
ago, said he hoped for a resolution of the position before the annual
meeting on April 21.
In a strongly worded statement he said the entire board, aside from Mr
Pritchard, had decided to 'terminate' Mr Pritchard's position as managing
director. The disagreement was 'not susceptible to any other solution'.
Mr Bradshaw said that the style needed to manage a group employing 7,000
people was very different to the entrepreneurial style appropriate when
Takare was founded.
Mr Hamilton Anstead moves up from deputy managing director to managing
director, and Mr Ron Reid, finance director, adds commercial director to his
role. Mr David Pegg, a non-executive, becomes deputy chairman.

FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: EuroLeisure in loss and finance package
agreed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European Leisure, the debt-laden snooker hall and discotheque operator, said
yesterday it had completed a financial restructuring to reduce gearing from
227 per cent to 101 per cent.
It also reported a loss of Pounds 344,000 pre-tax for the half year to
end-December compared with previous profits of Pounds 54,000.
The group blamed the turnround on Maygay, its fruit machines division which
struggled to break even during the period - it made profits of Pounds 1.5m
in the previous half year.
Group turnover fell from Pounds 35.3m to Pounds 30.1m and losses per share
came out at 0.89p (0.65p).
In the restructuring European Leisure has reached agreement with a syndicate
of eight banks, led by the TSB, Barclays and Bank of Scotland, to convert
Pounds 20m of debt into equity and roll anticipated annual interest of
Pounds 1m into loan notes over the next three years.
Mr Ian Rock, chief executive, said the company had been forced into the
restructuring by a cycle of over-priced acquisitions, significant trading
losses in France and Spain and high interest rates in the early 1990s.

FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Growth in SE Asia behind JIB advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Growth in south east Asia and the strength of the US dollar helped JIB
Group, the insurance broker in which the Hong Kong-based Jardine Matheson
has a 61 per cent interest, increase its pre-tax profits by 20 per cent in
1993.
Profits for the year to the end of December came out at Pounds 21.8m (Pounds
18.2m), at the upper end of expectations.
Earnings per share amounted to 11.4p, against 9.9p.
The company is recommending an unchanged final dividend of 5p per share,
making a same-again total of 7.5p.
Profits from south east Asia rose by 43 per cent to Pounds 7.58m (Pounds
5.29m), more than a third of the total.
Overall turnover increased by 16 per cent to Pounds 213.7m, while expenses
rose by 12 per cent to Pounds 197.7m.
After adjusting for the effects of acquisitions and exchange rates,
underlying revenues grew by 3 per cent.
COMMENT
Investors responded positively to yesterday's results marking the shares up
19p to close at 199p. The question, now, after a period of underperformance,
is how much more does JIB have to offer? The main problem is the group's
dependence on the highly competitive US market for more than a third of its
business. With the long-expected turn in the market proving to be something
of a mirage, JIB will do well to maintain margins. On the plus side more
currency gains are possible and further growth from south east Asia seems
likely. Profits for 1994 are forecast at Pounds 25m at least, putting the
share on a prospective multiple of 16. The prospect of an 8p dividend this
year provides yield support. Even so, some of JIB's rivals among the medium
sized insurance brokers may offer better value.

FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Cookson in Pounds 72m engineering disposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cookson, the specialist industrial materials group, yesterday completed the
latest phase of its strategic restructuring, with the Pounds 72m sale of 25
engineering subsidiaries, through a management buy-in.
Cookson will record a book loss of about Pounds 6m from the transaction, but
Mr Richard Oster, chief executive, said he felt Cookson had achieved a good
price for businesses which posted pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.3m in 1993.
'In March 1993, we talked about divesting businesses that didn't fit into
our core strategy for the future', said Mr Oster. 'This concludes the
short-term divestiture programme; now we have to focus on building up these
core businesses.'
The proceeds will help fund expansion in its strategic core, electronic
materials, ceramics, precious metal fabrication and plastics. Analysts
believe this will include small bolt-on acquisitions.
The companies sold by Cookson employ 1,800 people and are involved in
industrial materials, precision castings and aluminium.
They are being purchased by a management team put together by Mr Jim Cooper,
former business development director of John Wood. It will be renamed Calder
Group.
Morgan Grenfell and its development capital arm, have underwritten the deal
which involves Pounds 84.5m of funding to cover the acquisition cost and to
build up of working capital. The management will have a 17.5 per cent stake,
with a performance-related option for a further 2.5 per cent.
Cookson has been paid Pounds 69.4m in cash and will receive a further Pounds
0.3m in September. The Calder Group companies have also repaid Pounds 7.3m
of inter-group loans from Cookson and have taken on Pounds 2.2m in external
debt.
Cookson could receive as much as Pounds 10m, if Calder is sold or floated
within a five year period. The size of payment depends on the value of the
transaction.

FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Listing for GRT Bus
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GRT Bus Group, the Aberdeen-based bus and coach operator, is to seek a
listing next month. The flotation is likely to be by way of a placing
arranged by James Capel.
The company was formed to effect a management-led employee buy-out in
January 1989 of Grampian regional council's bus and coach operations, when
Grampian Regional Transport became the first Scottish municipal bus company
to be privatised.
The group employs 1,850 people and operates a fleet of 725 vehicles.
Employees currently hold 39 per cent of GRT's equity and the management a
further 51 per cent.
Since the buy-out, GRT's turnover has risen from Pounds 11.8m in 1989 to
Pounds 32m in the year to March 1993, with operating profits rising from
Pounds 850,000 to Pounds 3.6m. This excludes the Leicester and Northampton
operations - acquired in the latter part of 1993 - which had 1992-93
turnover and profits of Pounds 16.8m and Pounds 894,000.

FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Sea Containers rises and plans expansion
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sea Containers, the Bermuda-based leisure, ferry and container leasing
group, reported net earnings up by 8 per cent from Dollars 39.8m to Dollars
42.9m (Pounds 29.3m) for the 1993 year.
Revenue fell from Dollars 421m to Dollars 417m, principally because of the
strengthening of the dollar against the pound. Earnings emerged at Dollars
2.66 (Dollars 2.35).
The company also announced two share transactions. With a view to acquiring
the 58 per cent of Orient-Express Hotels it does not already own, it is
offering 0.17 Class A Sea Containers common shares for each Orient-Express
common share.
If, following the offer, it owns more the 90 per cent of Orient-Express, it
intends to merge it with a Sea Containers subsidiary on the same exchange
ratio basis as the offer. In addition, Sea Containers plans a public
offering of 5m Class A common shares with the primary purpose of retiring
the 2.3m 1982 series Dollars 2.10 cumulative preferred shares at their
current redemption price of Dollars 15.56 apiece.
The dividend rate on these shares is 14 per cent a year. The additional
equity, in combination with bank borrowings, will help the company fund its
container and ferry capital expansion programme, the company said.

FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Fairey impresses City with 27% rise to
Pounds 21.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Fairey Group climbed 18p to 759p yesterday after the specialist
electronics and engineering company unveiled a 27 per cent rise in 1993
pre-tax profits to Pounds 21.8m.
The improvement was fuelled mainly by the electronics and electrical power
division, which contributed Pounds 14.8m (Pounds 10.7m).
Mr John Poulter, group chief executive, said the division, representing 68.6
per cent of operating profits and 62 per cent of turnover, was the driving
force behind the company and would be the focus of further expansion.
The group is understood to have identified a number of potential
acquisitions and is said to be in talks with several target companies.
Such acquisitions are expected to be funded from the group's positive net
cash balance of Pounds 10.2m (Pounds 2.14m), although Mr Poulter did not
rule out coming to the market if a larger opportunity emerged.
He said Fairey's ability to expand had been underpinned by increased profits
in the group's two other core businesses - aerospace and defence, which
reported gains of Pounds 3.34m (Pounds 2.24m) and filtration and specialised
ceramics, ahead 18 per cent at Pounds 3.4m.
Together they boosted total operating profits by 36 per cent to Pounds 21.6m
(Pounds 15.8m) and lifted group turnover to Pounds 130.2m (Pounds 104.3m).
Mr Poulter said the results had also benefited from a Pounds 1m currency
gain on earnings by US subsidiaries.
While welcoming the 'healthy figures', Mr Michael Fay, group finance
director, said earnings per share of 37.8p (33.4p) had not advanced further
because of tax changes in the US and the diluting effect of a Pounds 10.3m
vendor placing in 1992 to acquire Infrared, the gauges business.
A final dividend of 8p makes an 11.8p (10.2p) total. A 1-for-1 scrip issue
is also proposed.
COMMENT
Despite its bulging wallet, Fairey is not about to embark on a shopping
spree. It has a reputation for spending money only on companies which can
deliver high margins in difficult markets. That cautious approach has, for
example, won new business for the aerospace and defence business at a time
when the industry is contracting. Impressed by a management whose
catchphrase could be 'the price is right', analysts are not expecting
dilutive acquisitions and have upgraded profit forecasts to Pounds 24m.
Although that puts the shares above the sector average on a prospective
multiple of 18.5, it could be a price worth paying for a business which last
year reported underlying cash generation of Pounds 12.4m.

FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Traffic side helps Peek to Pounds 7.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peek, the international traffic and field data systems group, announced
pre-tax profits up from Pounds 4.84m to Pounds 7.7m for the year to
end-December, aided by a strong performance from its traffic business.
Turnover rose 13 per cent to Pounds 100.6m (Pounds 88.8m), but organic
growth was only 5 per cent, as a result of weak UK and US markets and a fall
in orders from Husky, its mobile data systems company.
Peek has expanded aggressively through acquisition in the past five years,
building up its traffic business from 28 per cent of group sales to its
present level of 70 per cent.
Traffic operations focus on systems and products related to traffic
evaluation and control, and in 1993 the division contributed Pounds 7.1m in
trading profit, up from Pounds 6.6m.
Peek invested about Pounds 1.7m in building up its presence in Asia, Germany
and the US, during the year, and this should be reflected in stronger 1994
figures. It has picked up a Pounds 5m order to develop a traffic control
system in Bangkok, and contracts worth Pounds 8m for a second phase of this
system are under negotiation.
Mr Allen Standley, chief executive, said Peek was tendering for Pounds 50m
of contracts in Asia, including a number of projects in China, through a 41
per cent owned joint venture.
Field data operations saw trading profit fall to Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 2.12m),
primarily due to delayed orders, but the company said Husky experienced 'an
excellent order intake in the fourth quarter'.
The final dividend is maintained at 2.35p, for an unchanged 3.4p total.
Earnings per share were 4.6p, against 7.2p, although the 1992 figure was
significantly inflated by the release of tax provisions.
Peek will have a 17 per cent stake in TrafficMaster, thetraffic monitoring
system producer, following its imminent flotation. Peek said this was a
long-term strategic investment.
COMMENT
Peek has succeeded in developing a dynamic and broadly appealing business,
traffic control, but it has yet to translate this into strong organic
growth. The longer term potential from new developments, such as electronic
vehicle tagging, is enormous. But in the shorter term, Peek's earnings
growth will be more pedestrian. Pre-tax profits should increase by 10 per
cent to Pounds 8.5m in 1994. The shares are on a prospective p/e of 19 and a
yield of 3.7 per cent, which appears to leave it fully valued.

FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Watmoughs shows 26% rise to Pounds 15.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A buoyant domestic market for colour printing coupled with expansion in
Spain and Hungary helped Watmoughs (Holdings), the Bradford-based printer,
report a 26 per cent improvement last year.
Pre-tax profits for the year to end-December rose from Pounds 12.2m to
Pounds 15.4m on turnover up from Pounds 118.9m to Pounds 149.8m, including
Pounds 14.1m from new operations.
After adjusting for the capitalisation issue in October, earnings emerged at
15.9p (13p). A recommended final dividend of 5.1p (4.4p) raises the total to
6.6p (5.75p). The shares gained 7p to close at 511p.
Mr Patrick Walker, chairman and chief executive, said the improvement
reflected 'further progress in the group's UK activities, a successful start
to Watmoughs Espana, and the continued expansion of Revai Nyomda in
Hungary'.
Operating profits increased by 38 per cent to Pounds 17m (Pounds 12.3m),
including a Pounds 2.33m contribution from the new continental European
operations.
In the UK the advance achieved during the first half continued, and profit
for the year rose by 11 per cent from Pounds 12m to Pounds 13.3m, despite
reorganisation and redundancy costs of Pounds 471,000.
Mr Walker said the improving trend in demand for the group's specialised
gravure and web offset capacities in the UK continued throughout the year
and sales rose by 12 per cent to Pounds 128.8m (Pounds 115m.)
Net interest costs increased to Pounds 1.96m (Pounds 456,000) reflecting an
increase in net borrowings to Pounds 43.8m (Pounds 26m). Gearing climbed to
47 per cent (27 per cent). The higher borrowings reflected the growth in
capital expenditure last year which rose to Pounds 25.2m, including Pounds
13.8m to complete the group's gravure investment in Spain.
COMMENT
Tighter market conditions are providing Watmoughs with the opportunity to
weed out contracts with thin margins and push up contract prices by an
average 3 to 5 per cent as they come round for renewal. Both moves should
help push UK margins higher. The group has invested more than Pounds 100m
over the past three years in the UK and overseas, and now has some of the
most up-to-date presses in the industry, as well as a growing business in
southern and eastern Europe. Pre-tax profits should reach about Pounds 20m
this year, producing about 20.7p of earnings. The shares have doubled in the
past 15 months and are now trading on a lofty prospective multiple of 24.7.
A quality stock for holding.

FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Hartstone to raise at least Pounds 15m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hartstone, the hosiery and handbags group, yesterday announced details of a
rescue refinancing including an equity issue to raise more than Pounds 15m
this summer.
Hartstone is required to repay Pounds 15m by October to its creditors as a
condition of the new financing arrangements. These will provide lending
facilities until January 15 1996. The group said yesterday it intended to
issue shares to raise the funds, and to provide any necessary working
capital.
The new financing arrangements include:
As part of July 1993's standstill arrangements, the banks made extra
facilities available. The remaining Pounds 8.3m of this is to be repaid with
about Pounds 3.3m of the amount owed at the beginning of the standstill
period. The banks have converted the balance of their lending - about Pounds
45.1m - into secured loans.
The holders of the notes issued by Hartstone Holdings, the US holding
company, have agreed to continue to lend about Dollars 47.1m (Pounds 31.6m)
of their original total loans of Dollars 50m, the balance of which is to be
repaid. Of the continuing loans, a further Dollars 2.1m will be repaid on
March 31.
Charterhouse Group International will be paid about Dollars 900,000 in
partial payment of the outstanding consideration for Etienne Aigner and
Michael Stevens. The balance is to be converted into a secured term loan of
about Dollars 11.9m of which Dollars 600,000 will be repaid on March 31.
Aggregate interest to March 31 - about Pounds 5.6m - to the main creditors
is to be paid.

FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Spring Ram losses at Pounds 36.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Spring Ram, the kitchens and bathrooms group, reported pre-tax losses of
Pounds 36.4m for the year ended January 1, against pre-tax profits of Pounds
21.1m.
The loss mainly reflected the Pounds 30.2m provisions announced at the time
of the interim results, and was in line with the forecast made in January,
when the group's new management announced a Pounds 42.2m rights issue.
Mr Roger Regan, who took over as chairman last summer and forced the
resignation of Mr Bill Rooney, co-founder and chief executive, said the
group's main businesses had generated an increased level of sales throughout
the year in spite of the recession in the UK housing market.
'We are on the grind of a recovery programme, and we are very pleased with
the way it's going,' he said.
Turnover rose by 24 per cent from Pounds 193.3m to Pounds 239.5m, with the
kitchen division accounting for Pounds 123.9m (Pounds 109.8m).
However margins were squeezed in the kitchen division, and operating profits
fell from Pounds 18.3m to Pounds 8.3m. This reflected the new management's
action to cut stocks and overheads.
The bathroom division made an operating loss of Pounds 3.9m on turnover of
Pounds 60.1m, compared with a previous loss of Pounds 600,000 on turnover of
Pounds 60.6m.
Net borrowings at the end of the year were Pounds 24.8m. Mr Regan said that
the proceeds from the rights issue, which was 97.4 per cent taken up, had
wiped out core borrowing.
Losses per share were 11p, compared with earnings last time of 3.6p. The
board is proposing a final dividend of 0.1p (0.243p) to give a total of 0.1p
(0.346p).

FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Simon seeks Pounds 50m as losses rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Simon Engineering, which yesterday announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 160.3m
for 1993, is planning a Pounds 50m rights issue.
Mr Maurice Dixson, who became chief executive in a boardroom shake-out last
September, said the rights issue would be 'the corner stone that puts us on
a sound financial footing'.
Yesterday, the shares recovered from a low of 82p to close at 117p, up 11p.
Simon, which makes access equipment including fire rescue gear, flagged its
losses in January when it announced plans to raise Pounds 40m through
disposals.
The deficit, which compares with a previous pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.04m,
mostly reflects goodwill written off totalling Pounds 101.5m. This followed
the company's unwise diversification in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when
it acquired businesses based on markets and people, and with very little
assets.
The operating loss on continuing operations was Pounds 6.9m, compared with
an operating profit of Pounds 7.4m last time.
Losses per share were 22.3p (3p). The board is not recommending a dividend.
Turnover from continuing operations eased to Pounds 340.2m from Pounds
343.6m. Turnover from discontinued operations was Pounds 46m (Pounds 144m).
The new management's strategy is to cut debt and concentrate on three core
markets - the access division, the storage division and Simon-Carves, the
process engineering contractor.
Of the three, only Simon Storage reported an operating profit for the year,
up from Pounds 8.3m to Pounds 8.5m on turnover of Pounds 42.6m (Pounds
39.3m).
By the year end debt had been reduced to Pounds 117.8m from Pounds 148m when
Mr Dixson took over.
After the proposed rights issue, gearing would be cut from 264 per cent to
54 per cent immediately, and Mr Dixson was confident it would be reduced to
about 45 per cent by the end of this year.
However, the group would not go ahead with the rights issue until it had
completed protracted negotiations with its lenders. It hoped to normalise
its lending facilities so that it could grow the business to enhance
shareholder value, rather than to pay down debt.
COMMENT
The shares reacted immediately to the horrible figures coupled with a
proposed rights issue. But the later recovery reflects market realisation of
the new management's considerable achievement since September. In the first
half the company's haemorrhage of cash was continuing, with an outflow of
Pounds 43.7m; the second half saw a cash inflow of Pounds 13.1m. At the
present rate, this year should see the completion of the restructuring, and
benefits should start to flow through to shareholders in 1995. Investors who
bought into the company at the 34p low last July have already done well. On
balance, it looks as though the shares are still a buy, but the management
is at the beginning of a very long road.

FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Rugby hits Pounds 63.8m and encouraged by
outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits of Rugby Group, the supplier of cement to the UK, European
and US construction industries, rose by more than a tenth last year, from
Pounds 57.6m to Pounds 63.8m.
On the back of the improvement the final dividend is being lifted from 3.6p
to 3.92p making a 6.77p (6.45p) total. A 1-for-1 scrip issue is also
proposed.
Most forecasters had expected Rugby to do no more than hold the dividend at
the previous year's level.
The rise in operating profits from Pounds 52.8m to Pounds 64.6m, of which
acquisitions accounted for about Pounds 2m, was also higher than expected.
At the pre-tax level, profits were held back by a Pounds 1.2m loss on the
sale of the group's French glass business at the end of last year.
Earnings per share rose by 10.7 per cent to 14.5p (13.1p). Turnover
increased by 16.2 per cent, from Pounds 650.1m to Pounds 755.4m.
The group, which also signalled that it was looking for acquisitions, was
moderately encouraged about the state of construction markets in the US and
Australia and in the UK.
Mr Peter Carr, managing director, said that UK cement sales had risen by 5
per cent during the first ten weeks of this year compared with the
corresponding period of 1992.
Sales were not expected to continue to rise at this rate but could still
increase by about 3 per cent this year provided the housing market recovery
was not undermined by tax increases and spending cuts on road building
maintenance were not too deep.
Cement prices on average had risen by 4 per cent at the beginning of the
month. These, unlike increases in previous years, were expected to hold
although perhaps not by the full amount.
UK cement profits, boosted by a Pounds 1m pension refund, rose by 5.4 per
cent last year Pounds 17.7m. UK joinery profits, benefiting from the housing
market recovery and helped by price increases, rose by 20 per cent to Pounds
17.6m.
Australian cement and lime profits, assisted by additional capacity,
improved by 6.8 per cent to Pounds 12.5m.
COMMENT
Rugby's reputation as a well managed building materials group is deserved.
It has ridden out the recession well and rewarded its shareholders with an
early return to dividend increases. Profit forecasts are likely to be
upgraded in the light of yesterday's figures but the rate of recovery in the
UK could be slow. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 76m would put the group on a
prospective p/e of 19. Most of Rugby's virtues are already recognised in
this rating. Future fireworks may depend on acquisitions.

FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Broking strength lifts MAI to Pounds 48m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAI, the financial services and broadcasting group yesterday announced a 42
per cent increase in interim pre-tax profit to Pounds 48m mainly because of
the strength of its wholesale broking business.
Turnover increased by 57 per cent to Pounds 321m and earnings per share rose
by 38 per cent to 9p a share in the six months to December 31. The interim
dividend stays at 2p.
Sir James McKinnon, chairman, said trading in the second six months
continued to be good with high levels of activity in the financial markets
and an improving trend in car sales, market research and television
advertising.
The most significant development was the purchase of Anglia Television which
marked a change in the centre of gravity of the company towards media and
television in particular.
In February the group also increased its stake in Satellite Information
Services, the company broadcasting live racing to betting shops to 17.5 per
cent and sold its holding in Havas, the French media group for Pounds 45m.
Lord Hollick, chief executive expected 40 per cent of MAI's business to come
from the media within the next few years although financial services will
remain the core.
MAI's first big move into television - winning the ITV licence for the south
of England with Meridian Broadcasting - performed better than target and
made a small profit in its first year despite a difficult advertising
market.
In the six months to December Meridian had a turnover of Pounds 90m and
profits of Pounds 5.6m.
Lord Hollick dismissed as 'much ado about nothing' reports that minority
holders in Meridian, Carlton Communications and SelecTV, fear they will not
get the full benefit of the Anglia deal. Some in the industry believe the
relationship between Carlton and MAI may have become more edgy because of
advertising sales issues.

English China Clays held its 20p total dividend for 1993, as promised with
last year's rights issue, although earnings per share of 20.45p, against
26.72p, barely covered the pay-out. Mr Andrew Teare, chief executive, said
the thin dividend cover had not constrained the business.
Calgon, the US-based chemicals business acquired halfway through the year
for Pounds 202.3m, partly funded by the Pounds 113.4m rights issue,
contributed Pounds 7.2m to operating profits of Pounds 105.2m (Pounds
90.7m). Its purchase was 'mildly earnings enhancing,' Mr Teare said.
Group turnover rose 17 per cent to Pounds 1.13bn, with continuing operations
up 9 per cent at Pounds 1.05bn. Pre-interest profits of Pounds 105.3m
(Pounds 105.6m) included nearly Pounds 18m of profits on land sales, part of
ECC's strategy of running down its housing land bank.
They were struck after a Pounds 1.8m of profits on disposals and Pounds 1.7m
of provisions for costs of the demerger of the construction materials side.
In 1992 there was a net Pounds 17.1m profit on disposals.
Interest charges rose by Pounds 11.8m to Pounds 17.2m, to leave pre-tax
profits down from Pounds 100.2m to Pounds 88.1m.
At the operating level, ECC International, the minerals division, increased
sales volumes by 2 per cent, but a squeeze on prices and cost increases cut
operating margins from 15.6 to 11.1 per cent, with operating profits down
from Pounds 91.8m to Pounds 74.4m, before Pounds 3.3m of rationalisation
costs.
Construction materials profits recovered from Pounds 15.5m to Pounds 16.9m,
before an asset write down of Pounds 1.4m (rationalisation costs of Pounds
5.5m).
Construction, which included the land sales, chipped in Pounds 20m (Pounds
8.3m).

FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Gooding Consumer joint venture with Grundig
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A UK-based joint venture set up by Gooding Consumer Electronics and Grundig
announced plans yesterday to become a brand leader in the market for
satellite television reception equipment with a 30 per cent market share
within three years, writes Paul Taylor.
Grundig Satellite Communications, which claims to be the first launch of a
large UK consumer electronics company in 20 years, plans to design and build
the equipment at a plant in Llantrisant, Mid Glamorgan providing an initial
200 jobs, rising to 600 in three years.
Production will begin the end of March and the company aims to be producing
1m satellite receivers a year by the end of 1996.
The majority 70 per cent stake in the new company is held by Gooding
Consumer Electronics with Grundig holding the balance. Gooding Consumer is
owned by Mr Alfred Gooding with a minority holding by Mr Koen van Driel, a
former managing director of Grundig UK.
The new company will initially concentrate on the UK, expanding in the
second half into continental Europe and the newly-emerging Asia markets.
Investment in the project over the first three years is expected to be
Pounds 8.5m.

Carlson Companies of the US and Accor of France, two of the world's biggest
travel groups, plan to merge their business travel operations into a 50-50
venture, Carlson Wagonlit Travel, this summer.
The new venture, to be based in London, will vie with American Express for
the position of the biggest travel agency. It will have 4,000 branches in
125 countries with annual revenues of Dollars 10.8bn (Pounds 7.3bn).
The two companies being merged are the Carlson Travel Network, the second
biggest travel agency network in the US, and Accor's Wagonlit Travel, a
Paris-based agency operating in 125 countries.
The companies will combine their business travel operations in countries
where they overlap and set up new operations where neither company is
represented.
The companies said the merged operation would enable them to provide a
better service to international businesses which increasingly required
global travel management services.
Other offices covered by the deal include the Carlson P. Lawson Travel
offices and the Voyages Bel-Air business travel offices in Canada. Carlson's
AT Mays holiday business in the UK and its Neiman Marcus branches in the US
are not included.
Carlson Companies, Carlson Travel Network's parent, is one of the largest
private companies in the US. It is headed by the Swedish-born billionaire Mr
Curt Carlson, 79, who founded it in 1938 to sell trading stamps. Its three
main activities are marketing, hotels (including the Radisson chain) and
travel.
Accor is a Paris-based travel, tourism and businesses services company
operating 2,250 hotels under the Sofitel, Novotel, Motel 6, Mercure, Ibis
and Formule 1 names. It also operates 700 restaurants and owns the Europcar
car rental business.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Walt Disney prepares to share the pain: Restructuring at the
European park
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN and MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the past two weeks a team of executives from Walt Disney's Los Angeles
headquarters has been holed up in a Paris lawyers' office trying to piece
together a rescue deal for Euro Disney, the stricken European leisure group.
Their efforts were rewarded on Sunday when the Disney negotiators and a
steering committee of Euro Disney's banks, signed an outline agreement for a
package worth roughly FFr13bn (Pounds 1.5bn) that should save Euro Disney
from the receivers.
But the critical questions are what the restructuring means for the finances
of Euro Disney and its US parent?
When Walt Disney first mapped out a European version of its hugely
successful US theme parks, it calculated it would make a profit from its
opening year. Instead, Euro Disney, which opened in April 1992, produced a
net loss of FFr188m in the year to September 30, 1992, and thudded into a
bigger deficit of FFr5.3bn the following year.
Euro Disney had some operational problems, aggravated by the economic
recession which meant that, although attendance levels were almost in line
with expectations at around 11m in the first year, expenditure at the park
fell below expectations.
But the crux of Euro Disney's difficulties was its financial structure.
Disney had financed EuroDisneyland's construction through the flotation of
the remaining 51 per cent stake and through loans. Euro Disney had
originally expected to reduce its debt by selling property around the park,
but the recession forced it to abandon this. Meanwhile the high rate of
French interest rates raised the cost of servicing its remaining debt.
Early last year the company hoped to restructure its finances by persuading
its bankers to relax the terms of their loans. But when the recession
deepened it realised that more drastic action was required. In November
Disney summoned the banks to tell them it would support Euro Disney until
March 31 but that, unless a rescue was agreed, it would pull the plug and
Euro Disneyland would close.
The two sides have since been thrashing out an agreement. The main elements
are a FFr6bn rights issue and a FFr1.4bn transaction whereby Disney will
lease two of the theme park rides. - the Temple of Doom and Discovery
Mountain. The US group will also waive its rights to royalties and
management fees for five years: while the banks will accept an 18 month
interest holiday on their loans.
This package should halve Euro Disney's debt from FFr20.3bn to FFr10bn. The
company should also save FFr800m a year in interest charges and FFr450m in
payments to Disney. Euro Disney now hopes to break even next year. Ms
Rebecca Winnington-Ingram, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in London, is less
optimistic. She forecasts a net loss of FFr1.5bn in the year to September 30
and another loss of FFr140m next year before Euro Disney returns a net
profit of FFr450m in 1995/96.
However, analysts say the deal is positive for Walt Disney and its chairman,
Mr Michael Eisner, and while the parent is going to have to suffer its share
of Euro Disney pain, along with other investors and lenders, the burden is
well within the range Wall Street was expecting.
The fresh equity injection of Dollars 520m (Pounds 356m) will be in a
company with a better structured capital base, and which therefore stands a
chance of eventually making a return on the investment. Ms Jessica Reif, of
Oppenheimer &amp; Co, believes that the lease financing deal, together with the
equity, will take Walt Disney's total new financing commitment up to around
Dollars 750m 'and we think over the long term Disney will more than recoup
that'.
Disney's loss of royalties and management fees will not hurt much either.
These only amounted to Dollars 36.3m last year, a small sum relative to Walt
Disney's Dollars 1.7bn of operating income, and no one on Wall Street had
expected them to survive the restructuring.
On the positive side, the deal removes a large element of investor
uncertainty over the fate of Euro Disney, and the financial implications for
Walt Disney. The uncertainty has been hanging over the US company's stock
for months, undermining an otherwise strong earnings outlook.
Walt Disney reported a 34 per cent jump in first quarter net income, to
Dollars 368.6m, or 68 cents a share, and analysts said yesterday's outline
settlement would have no impact on their full-year earnings per share
forecasts of Dollars 2.10 to Dollars 2.15, up around 30 per cent from last
year.
The strongest earnings growth will come from the film business. The Lion
King, an animated movie due for summer release in the US, is expected to be
a big success, as will the release on video of Snow White. Disney's US theme
parks should also see renewed growth, helped by the opening of more
attractions.
Mr Christopher Dixon, at New York brokers PaineWebber, says that these
factors 'and a final solution to the Euro Disney mess should go a long way
to restoring investor confidence'. Walt Disney shares, he believes, 'are
well positioned to move up from here'. Adds Ms Reif: 'Disney has more
positive catalysts than any other company I follow over the next six
months.'

FT  15 MAR 94 / Former head of Bundesbank takes chair at drugs group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A fierce boardroom battle has broken out at Corange, the Bermuda-based
pharmaceutical group which is parent company of Boehringer Mannheim, one of
Germany's largest healthcare companies.
Mr Curt Engelhorn, the 67-year-old German who owns 24 per cent of the
family-owned Corange's shares, has been removed as chairman and replaced on
temporary basis by Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the former president of the
Bundesbank, who has been deputy-chairman since 1992.
The Corange board is also attempting to eject Mr Engelhorn as chairman of
the supervisory board of Boehringer Mannheim, a company founded 125 years
ago. Mr Engelhorn was chief executive for 30 years until 1990 when he moved
up to the supervisory board.
The dispute follows a change of strategy at Corange, a group with worldwide
sales last year of Dollars 3.2bn (Pounds 2.14bn) in diagnostics,
pharmaceuticals and orthopaedic products.
The new strategy is due to the appointment of Mr Max Link as chief executive
last year. He made two moves into the fledgling US biotechnology sector and
has implemented a restructuring of Boehringer Mannheim.
This will lead to the loss of 15 per cent of the 9,600 jobs in Germany and
some manufacturing activities are to be transferred to cheaper locations
abroad.
Mr Peter Warburton, the London-based international counsel to Corange, said
yesterday that Mr Engelhorn had been displaced as chairman 'because of a
complete breakdown in confidence between the board and Mr Engelhorn'.
Mr Pohl, who left the Bundesbank in 1991, is the only German national among
the six members of the Corange board.

FT  15 MAR 94 / NW Water recruits from Tarmac
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
North West Water yesterday sought to lay to rest any anxieties over its
international expansion by appointing as its new chief executive Mr Brian
Staples, former head of Tarmac's contracting business.
He replaces Mr Bob Thian, widely credited with building North West's
international business. Mr Thian, a forceful manager, left in November
following what was reported as a 'difference in management style' with the
equally hands-on chairman, Sir Desmond Pitcher.
The City yesterday gave a cautious welcome to Mr Staples' appointment,
although as a divisional manager he is relatively unknown. 'He is a very,
very good risk analyser,' said one analyst. This, and his experience in
managing large sums of capital investment, would prove invaluable to North
West's international expansion, among the more aggressive in the UK water
industry.
Mr Staples, 48, became chief executive of Tarmac's construction division in
1992 and is highly regarded as a UK contractor within his industry. He had
been about to join the Tarmac main board. He said he intended to conduct a
strategic review at North West once he had learned his way around the water
industry. On the international side, he said North West would focus on
operating contracts, as opposed to the higher-risk contracting projects.
Sir Desmond said North West, which has suffered a number of executive
upheavals since privatisation in 1989, had sought to appoint a 'team
leader'.
Mr Staples was also arriving at a particularly 'important time for North
West as the regulatory review moves to completion'. The management of the
massive capital investment programme under the new pricing regime to be set
by the industry regulator this summer would be crucial to the group's
profits, he said.
Tarmac announced yesterday that, following the departure of Staples, it
plans to divide the construction business into two divisions. Mr Brian
Pellard, 51, managing director of Tarmac Construction Regions, will head the
contracting division. Steve Redding, managing director of Tarmac's
management division, will take charge of the professional services business
expanding its consultancy operations.

FT  15 MAR 94 / ECC to hold payout after demerger: English China Clays falls
to Pounds 88.1m while construction side Camas rises to Pounds 16.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
English China Clays promised the total payout to shareholders would be at
least maintained at the 20p 1993 dividend after the demerger of its
construction materials division this summer. The new company will be called
Camas and is expected to have a market value of between Pounds 250m and
Pounds 300m. It will pay a 3.75p 1994 final dividend.
ECC yesterday set out the capital structure and board of Camas, and details
of the timetable for the split, mooted last summer. Shares will be given to
ECC shareholders on a one-for-one basis.
The news accompanied results for 1993, which showed group pre-tax profits
down from Pounds 100.2m to Pounds 88.1m. The Camas business lifted operating
profits from Pounds 15.5m to Pounds 16.9m before one-off costs.
The split will leave ECC to concentrate on its minerals and speciality
chemicals business, with a continuing cash flow from sales of its housing
land bank. Camas operates in Europe - largely in the UK - and in the US,
integrating quarrying, coated stone, concrete products and road surfacing
activities.
Mr Andrew Teare, ECC's chief executive, said the demerger would enable both
businesses to grow in international markets, and separate businesses that
'had bugger all to do with each other'.
Camas had net debt of about Pounds 67m at the end of 1993, adjusting for
this month's Dollars 31.5m (Pounds 21.5m) acquisition of Kost Brothers in
the US, but borrowings will be Pounds 25m higher at the demerger which is a
seasonal peak.
Capital employed in Camas was Pounds 278.8m at the year end, and it
generated cash during the year of Pounds 31.9m. Once demerged it will bear a
Pounds 1m annual cost of being an independent group.
The continuing ECC business will have debt of around Pounds 200m and
shareholders' funds Pounds 520m to Pounds 530m, Mr Patrick Drayton, ECC
finance director said, giving gearing slightly higher than the 33.8 per cent
at the end of 1993. The total cost of the demerger exercise would be around
Pounds 4m.
Camas is to be chaired by Mr Maurice Warren, chairman of Dalgety and South
Western Electricity. Mr Alan Shearer, managing director of the division,
will be chief executive, and Mr David Tidmarsh will join from Foster Yeoman,
the private aggregates group, as managing director.
The demerger is due to become effective on June 1, after a special meeting
on May 31, with shares going to holders on the register on May 27.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Ford increases Aston Martin stake to fund new sports car
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford, the US carmaker, has injected Pounds 50m of new equity capital into
Aston Martin Lagonda, increasing its stake in the UK luxury sports carmaker
from 75 per cent to 99.5 per cent.
The capital has been provided partly to cover losses but most importantly to
fund the development of the new Aston Martin DB7 sports car, which is
planned to begin production next month.
The launch of the DB7 is set to transform the fortunes of the UK luxury
sports car maker and raise its annual output more than fivefold by 1995-96.
It will provide a successor for the famous DB6, which ceased production in
1971.
Ford initially took a 75 per cent stake in Aston Martin in late 1987. The US
group dominates the UK luxury car sector following its takeover of Jaguar in
1989.
The burden of the DB7 project has pushed Aston Martin into heavy loss. It
suffered a pre-tax loss of Pounds 18.87m last year following losses of
Pounds 15.97m in 1992 and Pounds 5.8m in 1991. The DB7 development programme
was previously funded by a Pounds 34m revolving loan from the Ford parent
company which has been paid off following the Pounds 50m equity injection.

FT  15 MAR 94 / G7 ministers move to tackle jobs creation: Germany warns
unskilled workers are at risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DETROIT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ministers from the Group of Seven industrial nations yesterday began work on
plans to tackle unemployment, as the German labour minister warned that
Germany might lose 3m unskilled jobs over the next eight years.
US president Bill Clinton, opening a two-day summit of G7 employment and
economics ministers on measures to boost job creation, called on the G7 to
tackle down-to-earth economic issues rather than concentrating exclusively
on macroeconomic policy and high finance.
But a US proposal to set up a G7 working party to study employment policy
has already been dismissed by several countries. Mr Gunter Rexrodt,
Germany's economics minister, said a working party would be 'superfluous',
since the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development already
performed a similar task. 'If you set up machinery, a lot of the work goes
into setting up the machinery rather than into substantive work,' added
another official at the meeting.
The German delegation expressed a number of other minor differences with the
US approach and Mr Rexrodt dismissed US calls for more expansionary
macroeconomic policies.
Mr Clinton proposed the jobs summit at the G7 summit meeting in Tokyo last
year. The summit, on the shores of Detroit's East-West river, is expected to
yield a framework for the full G7 meeting in Naples this summer.
G7 officials declined to discuss details of the principles which Mr Lloyd
Bentsen, the US treasury secretary and conference chairman, will set out
when the meeting closes today. But a senior White House official said the
final statement would be nothing like the five-point plan some other
countries had suggested might be agreed.
'It will have principles in it but they are not going to be of the kind that
suggests a highly concrete programme,' said Mr Bowman Cutter, a Clinton
adviser.
The conclusions, well short of a formal communique, are likely to address
subjects such as re-employment, open markets and technology, and to remain
general in order to avoid offending any country.
Mr Clinton promised that the US would continue to bring its budget deficit
down. He called on Japan to stimulate domestic demand and on Europe to work
for lower interest rates.
But he also called for more fundamental structural changes in unemployment
benefit systems, training systems and employment regulations.
'Unless people believe they are prepared for the jobs of the future, that
productivity benefits them and they can have both strong work lives and
strong families in a dynamic economy, they will turn against change,' he
said.
Mr Clinton made a plea against age discrimination. 'If you want people to
embrace change, we all have to change our attitude about who is employable,
and especially on each end of the age spectrum,' he said.
Mr Clinton's message won broad acceptance from delegates. 'We are completely
in agreement with the policies outlined,' said Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK
chancellor.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Christopher prepares way for renewing China's trade status
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, yesterday appeared to be
preparing the ground for a recommendation that the administration should
renew China's Most Favoured Nation trading status, saying the two sides had
narrowed their differences on human rights.
He sought to put the best gloss on two days of bruising talks with Chinese
officials in Beijing. Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, was however
less conciliatory, noting that there was still a wide gap between the US and
China in their human rights 'concepts'.
Mr Qian also warned that US business would be excluded from the vast Chinese
market if the administration failed to renew the country's MFN status.
Two-way trade exceeded Dollars 40bn last year.
Mr Christopher, who has to advise President Bill Clinton within the next two
months on whether to continue China's preferential trade access to the US,
described his meeting yesterday with Mr Qian as 'businesslike and
productive'. He was confident China wanted 'broad and solid' relations with
the US.
'I find that the differences between China and the US are narrowing
somewhat,' he told reporters before leaving Beijing for Vladivostok, where
he met Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister.
In Washington, however, President Clinton said he was disappointed with the
Chinese talks. He would make a judgment on MFN 'at the appropriate time', he
added.
Mr Christopher was hard put to point to specific progress on the vexed human
rights issue, beyond a memorandum of understanding on trade in prison labour
products.
He said there had been progress on emigration and political prisoners, with
the Chinese side providing lists of 235 detainees, including 106 Tibetans.
US human rights experts would be evaluating these cases.
He had urged China to begin discussions with the Dalai Lama about 'cultural
and religious matters' in Tibet. Tibetan activists allege widespread human
rights abuses, including the destruction of traditional culture.
The secretary of state's visit was marked by acrimonious exchanges with
officials, and by harassment of dissidents, some of them 'exiled' from
Beijing while Mr Christopher was in town.
China and the US also marked the visit by agreeing to resume military
consultations broken off after the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Senior BT managers may face compulsory redundancy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior managers at British Telecom, Britain's largest company, some earning
annual salaries of over Pounds 100,000, face the prospect of compulsory
redundancy in the coming financial year as the company's drive to cut jobs
reaches top managers.
Managers earning more than Pounds 50,000 a year are the first to be targeted
in BT's drive to cut 15,000 jobs by March 31 1995. The company said 30 to 35
of its 170 managers at director level, who earn on average Pounds 76,000 a
year, are being encouraged to leave.
Mr Michael Hepher, BT's group managing director, said: 'We need to reduce
the number of senior managers significantly by the end of next March. But
there are simply not enough volunteers coming forward.'
BT's threat of compulsory redundancies for senior managers - extremely rare
among large companies - marks a further toughening of its stance. Earlier
this year the group froze the basic wages of most managers for this calendar
year, and suspended its year-old performance-related pay scheme which it
said was too expensive.
Only 245 senior managers have taken voluntary redundancy in the current
financial year, which is just 3 per cent of the 6,957 senior managers on
personal contracts, says BT. In the same period 7,700 engineering staff
left, about 9 per cent of the total in these grades. In 1992-93 about 630
senior managers left. BT employs 153,000 staff.
'We will do everything we can to encourage sufficient volunteers but we must
face the possibility that, if there are too few volunteers, we will have to
move away from a purely voluntary approach for senior managers,' Mr Hepher
warned.
Compensation payments at BT range from 40 weeks' pay for 10 years of service
to a maximum of 72 weeks' pay for 14 years. Staff who have been with the
company since before 1971 will get three years' pay.
Leaders of the Society of Telecom Executives, which represents BT's middle
managers, accused BT of breaching an assurance they alleged had been given
last year by Mr Hepher that there would be no compulsory redundancies.

FT  15 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: MAI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MAI's strong performance in all of its main businesses must reassure any
investors concerned about the expensive acquisition of Anglia Television.
Money and securities broking continues to push up profits. Meridian, the
majority-owned Channel 3 franchise, is ahead of expectations. Information
and market research is also doing well. Across the board, the profit
increases have been underpinned by strong management and cost controls.
With that record, MAI should be relied on to squeeze value from Anglia.
Several of Anglia's peripheral holdings may go and the recent disposal of
MAI's final holding in Havas shows how profitably it can manage such
investments. Despite paying almost Pounds 300m for Anglia, the company
retains a virtually ungeared balance sheet.
What remains at issue is whether the market will rate MAI as a steady
financial broker or a go-go media stock. Next year around 20 per cent of
earnings will come from television while 60 per cent may come from broking.
Yet it may be a mistake to rate the company too lowly. Broking has
consistently grown faster than predicted, and television earnings are highly
geared to recovery. There is scope for a pleasant surprise. It is also worth
keeping a weather-eye on the pace of MAI's progress. Anglia, an increased
stake in SIS racing, interest in Channel 5 and the National Lottery, and a
watching brief on Intrum Justitia are plenty for even the most nimble
management team to handle.

<TEXT>
Taken in isolation, yesterday's UK producer price figures should have been a
tonic for gilts. Output prices showed an underlying increase of just 2.4 per
cent in the year to February and there has been a marked deceleration in the
last three months. Input prices showed a small seasonally-adjusted increase
in February, but they are still down 3.6 per cent on the year despite
scaremongering about commodity price rises. That gilts only managed a
half-point rise in low volume clearly reflected continuing worries about how
the New York bond market will react to this week's torrent of US data.
With long gilt yields some 5 percentage points above inflation, the positive
message from yesterday's producer prices must eventually reassert itself.
Then the authorities might again have an opportunity to raise long-term
funds at rates well below 7 per cent. This week they must decide whether to
hold an auction in March. If they are brave enough to go ahead, they may
have to content themselves with a short-dated issue. The producer price
figures could help with that by keeping hopes of lower base rates alive.
The figures are good news for equities too, whether or not they lead to a
rate cut. The large discrepancy between the trends in input and output
prices suggests manufacturers are enjoying higher margins without
inflationary price rises. Small wonder earnings and dividends are turning
out higher than the market expected.

FT  15 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: English China Clays
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Demerging out of building materials makes strategic sense now that English
China Clays has set its sights on chemistry rather than digging holes in the
ground. The exercise also usefully relieves the parent of the need to
support its capital-intensive offspring during the upturn. Yet ECC has
resisted the temptation to burden Camas, the demerged company, with more
than its fair share of the dividend. It is touch and go whether ECC would
have covered its share of the pay-out once earnings from building materials
and land sales are stripped out of yesterday's full-year figures.
While surplus land is being sold and capital spending is below depreciation,
the cash cost of the dividend is bearable. But at the current rate of
progress the land bank will be empty within two years. Neither can a sudden
revival in minerals - which accounts for four-fifths of continuing turnover
 -be relied upon. True, margins are now some 5 percentage points below the
peak and recent price increases are an encouraging sign. If changes in paper
technology depress demand for kaolin, though, rebuilding margins will be a
long haul.
ECC thus still needs to find earnings growth elsewhere. Calgon, the
specialty chemicals company acquired last year, provides a useful first step
in that direction but is too small to transform the prospects of the group.
Additional critical mass might also help Calgon compete from a poor third
place in the US market. After two rights issues in three years ECC has room
to borrow. To justify maintaining the dividend through the downturn, it now
has to spend wisely.

FT  15 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Disney's rude awakening
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It was appropriate that Euro Disney staged its annual meeting in its rodeo
hall, given that the restructuring proposals threaten to trample ordinary
shareholders underfoot. The agreement conjured up between the banks and Walt
Disney promises a massive dilution of shareholders' interests. The FFr6bn
rights issue, supported by Walt Disney and underwritten by a syndicate of
banks, will probably be priced around the FFr10 par value of the shares.
Combined with related leasing deals, this implies that the number of shares
in issue will rise from 170m to closer to 800m on a fully diluted basis.
After rising 8 per cent in the morning, the shares closed 7 per cent lower
as that reality dawned.
At least Walt Disney and the banks now seem fully committed to making the
park work. By forgiving 18 months of interest charges and deferring all
principal payments for three years, the banks have bought Euro Disney plenty
of breathing space. Euro Disney should eventually be able to service its
remaining FFr10bn debt with little difficulty. The question is whether any
upside exists when Euro Disney re-emerges from its temporary financial
fantasyland.
It is tempting to believe the new shares may hold some speculative appeal
when the French economy recovers. But as has always been the case, Walt
Disney's shares must offer a better bet for those convinced that Euro Disney
will flourish. Walt Disney has waived its lucrative royalties and management
fees for five years but they will be re-applied in time. And if Euro Disney
proves a wild success, Walt Disney's magical incentive fees will be
transformed into gold.

<TEXT>
Ministers from the Group of Seven industrial nations yesterday began work on
a five-point plan to tackle mass unemployment as the German labour minister
warned that Germany faced the loss of 3m unskilled jobs over the next eight
years.
US President Bill Clinton, opening a two-day summit of G7 employment and
economics ministers on measures to boost job creation, called on the G7 to
tackle down-to-earth economic issues rather than concentrating exclusively
on macroeconomic policy and high finance.
But a US plan to set up a G7 working party to study employment policy has

be 'superfluous', since the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development already performs a similar task. 'If you set up machinery, a lot
of the work goes into setting up the machinery rather than into substantive
work,' added another official at the meeting.
Germany has been the least enthusiastic participant in the Detroit meeting,
with Mr Rexrodt dismissing US calls for more expansionary macroeconomic
policies as part of an overall jobs strategy.
Mr Clinton proposed the jobs summit at the G7 summit meeting in Tokyo last
year. The summit, on the shores of Detroit's East-West river, is expected to
yield a framework for the full G7 meeting in Naples this summer.
G7 officials declined to discuss details of the five-point plan, but it is
likely to address subjects such as re-employment, open markets and
technology, and to remain general in order to avoid offending any country.
Mr Clinton did not abandon the traditional subjects of G7 discussion. While
he promised that the US would continue to bring its budget deficit down, he
also called on Japan to stimulate domestic demand and for Europe to work for
lower interest rates.
But he also called for more fundamental structural changes in unemployment
benefit systems, training systems and employment regulations, in order to
reassure people that they can gain from a dynamic economy.
'Unless people believe they are prepared for the jobs of the future, that
productivity benefits them and they can have both strong work lives and
strong families in a dynamic economy, they will turn against change,' Mr
Clinton said.
Mr Clinton made a plea against age discrimination. 'If you want people to
embrace change, we all have to change our attitude about who is employable,
and especially on each end of the age spectrum,' he said.
'We have people that won't hire kids because they don't have any experience.
How are they ever going to get any experience if they don't get a job,
right? Then we have people who won't hire older people because they've got
too much experience,' he added.
Mr Clinton's message won broad acceptance from delegates of varying
political hues.
'We are completely in agreement with the policies outlined in Mr Clinton's

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Standards in British public life have declined in the last century or two.
Or have they? The armed forces at least seem to have improved, either in
military prowess or in private morality, or both. Or maybe it is just that
Britain is now safer than it was during the Napoleonic wars, and so can be
choosier about its military leaders.
In those days the nation was reduced to entrusting its fortunes to notorious
adulterers. The Duke of Wellington, it will be remembered, was unworried by
Miss Harriette Wilson's threat to publish her autobiography, and with good
reason.
He knew that Lord Nelson had been allowed to retain his command, in spite of
his public and prolonged dalliance with the wife of a senior diplomat. Both
noblemen got away with what the admirable Lady Buck - whose public spirit
last week triumphed over mere sentimental loyalty - would no doubt have
called 'the most immense security risk'.
Thank goodness times have changed. There are now whole platoons of generals,
admirals and air marshals qualified by moral character, as well as military
genius, to fill the post of chief of defence staff. So no sooner had Lady
Buck revealed Sir Peter Harding's (and her own) shortcomings on the former
point than he resigned from that post. His 'professionalism, energy and
skill', though acknowledged by the defence secretary, were found expendable.
How Sir Peter must have wished that the Duke of Wellington's riposte to Miss
Wilson - 'publish and be damned' - were available to him. But then the Duke
of Wellington had not recently launched a code of conduct requiring 'better
standards of personal behaviour' from officers and men.
Perhaps marriage today is taken more seriously than in Wellington's time,
although (or even because) it is more easily dissolved. And no doubt
integrity is a virtue to be prized in the armed forces even more than
elsewhere. But are we really so virtuous that adultery has become a
disqualification for military command?

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The British way of receivership, administration and liquidation is, by
comparison with, say, the German approach, a rough old business. But the
Department of Trade and Industry has recently been doing its best to foster
a more constructive climate for insolvency practice in Britain. The Appeal
Court ruling in the Paramount Airways case clearly created uncertainty about
the personal liability of insolvency practitioners in relation to employees'
contracts and thus threatened jobs. Against that background Mr Heseltine's
decision to amend the 1986 Insolvency Act is a commendable step down the
road towards a rescue culture.
To anyone but a lawyer the grounds for the Appeal Court's decision looked
pedantic. Until now, receivers and administrators have followed earlier case
law to avoid liability under the act for all contracts that they adopt after
their appointment. This has involved writing to employees within a 14-day
period to disclaim liability for employment contracts. Lord Justice Dillon
decided that this was purely cosmetic; and that where administrators and
receivers continued to employ staff and pay them in accordance with their
previous contracts, they would be deemed to have adopted those contracts.
The worry was that insolvency practitioners would feel unable to take on the
increased risk of keeping the company afloat with a view to sale as a going
concern and conclude instead that liquidation was the only solution. Banks
might also have been encouraged to assess creditworthiness more on the basis
of asset values, because greater resort to liquidation would destroy
goodwill while leaving assets intact. Since the detailed legislation will
not appear on the statute for some time - though it will apply with effect
from midnight last night - it remains to be seen how Mr Heseltine has dealt
with the potential claims against receivers and administrators stretching
back to the implementation of the 1986 Act. But there is no question that
the insolvency practitioners' lobbying has scored a victory.
This was not, however, the only area of insolvency in which current practice
involves a threat to jobs. One score on which the accountants have not been
lobbying relates to the potential conflict of interest where they advise
banks on the viability of client companies and then accept the resulting
receivership or administration. The abuse of this conflict can never be
susceptible of proof. But sufficient suspicion has been aroused over the
past recession to suggest that this should be another priority for the DTI.
The irony in the present legislative revision is that it attacks the
enhanced status of employees in an insolvency vis a vis other creditors  -
the de facto position, if not the legal one, in the much trumpeted German
approach to corporate rescuscitation. There are rescue cultures and rescue
cultures, it seems.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Leading Article: A good deal for Poland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Poland's agreement with the London Club for the reduction of its Dollars
13.2bn commercial bank debt is a good deal for the country. It opens the
door for a resumption of lending to Poland on normal commercial terms, after
a lengthy hiatus. Above all, it sends a signal to private investors that
investment in Poland is a normal risk.
The outline terms agreed in Frankfurt last week still have to be fleshed out
by months of detailed research into the exact amounts of debt and accrued
interest owed to each of the 400 or so banks involved. Warsaw also still has
to make known the amount and terms of its debt buy-back. But the agreement
indicates that the banks are to a write down between 42.5 and 45 per cent of
the net present value of the debt. This is more generous than the secondary
market had been expecting. The price of Polish debt accordingly fell after
the deal was announced.
Neither side obtained exactly what it wanted. The Polish team had been
seeking a 50 per cent reduction, similar to that obtained from the Paris
Club of official creditors on Dollars 33bn of government-backed loans three
years ago. But the banks refused to be bound by the Paris Club agreement,
which obliged the Polish government to seek comparable terms from the banks.
While aware of the tight, IMF-approved budgetary constraints on the Polish
government, the banks argued that their shareholders could not be treated in
the same way as governments, which agreed to a 50 per cent write off as a
political gesture of recognition for Poland's role in the downfall of
communism and support for its pioneering market reforms.
Three years down the road, those reforms have started to pay off. Last year
Poland, with 4 per cent growth, boasted the most dynamic economy in
recession-struck Europe. This year growth is expected to accelerate to 5 per
cent, albeit against the background of inflation at 36 per cent last year, a
15 per cent unemployment rate and a Dollars 2.3bn trade deficit.
Foreign investment is needed if such growth is to be sustained. The way that
Polish companies, constrained by reluctant banks and expensive loans, have
managed to fund their own expansion out of retained profits has been
impressive. The explosive growth in Polish share prices is another
indication that Poland's ability to finance growth out of its domestic
savings may be higher than could have been imagined one year ago. But even
this will not be enough.
Access to international capital markets on normal commercial terms is
essential if Poland is to fund the heavy infrastructure investment needed to
modernise road, rail and telecommunication links, restructure the energy
sector, and reduce pollution. Improved infrastructure is required if the
current recovery is to be turned into sustained rapid growth. The London
Club agreement will facilitate such access to foreign capital.
Above all, however, the Frankfurt agreement will encourage equity
investment. This is the kind of investment most needed by all post-communist
countries, because it brings technological know-how, managerial skills, new
exportable products and access to world markets. Until now Hungary, with a
higher debt burden per head than Poland but an impeccable repayment record,
and the Czech Republic have received the lion's share of inward direct
investment. Now Poland, with its market of 39m people and strategic
position, is poised to compete more effectively for such funds.
This is one of the most important prizes Poland has earned for persevering
with its painful, market-orientated reforms. Both Poland and the London Club
have sent a clear and powerful message to countries like Russia and Ukraine,
whose faith in market reforms, never strong, is faltering. If you stay the
course, there is hope. If you waiver, the pain can only get worse.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Shifts in perception: The employers' view of the jobs market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government likes to claim that the UK labour market adjusts virtually
simultaneously to changes in demand. Employers appear to agree - but they
give scarcely any credit to the government for bringing about this state of
affairs.
The flexibility of the jobs market, they say, has little to do with reforms
to labour legislation, and more to do with global competition, the recent
recession and changing attitudes towards work.
'A shift in the perception of work, together with a shortage of work and the
fact that businesses are open for much longer hours have combined to make
the market very definitely more flexible than it was 10 years ago,' says Mr
Keith Cameron, group personnel director at the Burton Group, the retail
group.
A reorganisation at Burton a year ago resulted in the shedding of 2,000
full-time jobs and their replacement with about 3,000
part-time positions. 'We spread the available work across more people,' says
Mr Cameron. The move has also allowed Burton to respond more efficiently to
busy and slow periods in its clothing stores, he maintains.
Other employers say a change in union attitudes helps explain different work
patterns. Describing the flexible approach to hours now adopted by
Courtaulds Clothing, the clothing division of Courtaulds Textiles, Mr David
Hunt, personnel executive, says: 'The trade unions would not have talked to
us about such changes some years ago, because they were banned by union
policy and conference mandates. Now they understand that, if there is going
to be a recovery in the
industry, which is much smaller than it was, they need to be well aware of
what it takes to satisfy the customer.'
His view is shared by Mr Geoff Armstrong, director-general of the Institute
of Personnel Management. 'Government reforms were not the primary driver
behind all the changes in working practices,' he says. 'These were things
that would have happened anyway. More and more managers and employees have
had to find innovative ways of working in order to compete, and many trade
unions have been supportive of the process.'
Some employers are more cynical, believing that the high number of
unemployed people, unable to
find full-time work, means that employers can save money by hiring part-time
staff.
'I don't think there are massive structural differences between now and 10
years ago,' says Mr Paul Dowling, head of corporate affairs at Asda, the
supermarket chain, which employs many part-time workers. 'The labour market
just waxes and wanes with recession.'
Mr Ian Handford, national policy chairman of the Federation of Small
Business, agrees: 'The thing that makes life easiest for employers now is
simply the number of full-timers looking for jobs, part-time or otherwise.'
As far as he is concerned, the government continues to hinder the efficient
functioning of the labour market, particularly through the structure of
social security payments.
'It is simply not true to say that there is more flexibility in the
marketplace as far as part-time work is concerned,' he says. 'Only this week
I wanted to extend the hours of one of my members of staff, but she couldn't
do it because of the losses to her social security benefits that the extra
hours would have entailed.'
Another test of a responsive labour market is the ease with which employers
can hire and fire to cope with changes in demand. Until the mid-1980s, the
bill for making redundancy payments was refunded through the National
Insurance Fund. Now employers have to carry the burden themselves, and this
appears to be restricting the flexibility of the jobs market. This is
particularly so for small employers, for some of which the cost of
redundancy is prohibitive.

</HEADLINE>

The Conservatives have been having trouble dreaming up a catchy slogan for
June's elections to the European parliament. With Tory Europhobes and
Europhiles at Westminster sensitive to the slightest hint that the other
side has gained the upper hand, the party's image-makers have their work cut
out.
One front-runner was 'Making Europe Work for You'. Rather dull, admittedly;
but it has the merit of being studiously neutral and fits in nicely with a
similar Tory theme for the May local government elections.
But there's a snag - isn't there always these days for the Tories? It turns
out that Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats - unpatriotic federalists in Tory
eyes - have already unveiled their slogan: 'Making Europe Work for Us'.
Back to the drawing board at Central Office. Perhaps 'Making Europe Work for
Them'?

So much for the senior service. One of the odd aspects of the resignation of
Sir Peter Harding as chief of the defence staff is that the Army's Sir Peter
Inge, the eldest of the three service chiefs, has leapfrogged Admiral Sir
Jock Slater, the vice chief, to take control of the country's defences on a
temporary basis at least.
Inge is regarded as a 'soldier's soldier' rather than a 'Whitehall warrior',
so he might well be the forces' favourite for the job on a permanent basis.
The other oddity is that, while Sir Peter has resigned as chief of defence
staff, he has not resigned as a marshal of the RAF and so remains
technically on the 'active service' list along with all the other five star
officers.

Is this the first recorded sighting of a Maxwell House? Jack Rose, a veteran
property man whose book is reviewed in today's Business Books supplement,
records how he had tried to buy a derelict factory on London's Marylebone
Road in the late 1940s. However, a recently demobbed Robert Maxwell pipped
him to the post, turned it into a wholesale bookstore and renamed it Maxwell
House.
Maxwell's partner in the deal was none other than Clarence Hatry, who in his
hey-day was an even better known fraudster than Cap'n Bob. The collapse of
the Hatry empire in 1929, after Hatry had been caught forging bogus share
certificates, helped precipitate the 1929 Wall Street crash.
So now we know where Maxwell learned the tricks of his trade.

Cabinet ministers are displaying a remarkable lack of candour in some of
their parliamentary answers, despite William Waldegrave's assurances last
week that MPs are misled only in times of national emergency.
Labour MP Roland Boyes has been trying to tease out the inner secrets of the
ministerial drinks cupboard. To be specific, how many bottles of whisky,
gin, sherry and port have been consumed in ministerial offices - at
taxpayers' expense - over the past year.
The Treasury's Anthony Nelson, standing in for his beer drinking chancellor,
concluded rather pompously that 'disaggregated information of this sort
could only be obtained at disproportionate cost'. Could it mean Treasury
ministers have guzzled so much of the stuff - while awaiting the green
shoots to finally surface - that they're unable to keep count?
A similar dead bat was played by Michael Howard at the Home Office. All he
would say was that the amount, whatever it was, is included in his
department's overall entertainment budget.
Education secretary John Patten at least tried to show he has a sense of
humour: 'The information at this level of distillation is not readily
available.'
But Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney general under fire for his part in the
Scott inquiry, is clearly in no mood either for jokes or parties at the
moment. His answer to Boyes: 'None'.

FT  15 MAR 94 / In, out, share the work about: David Goodhart tests how far
labour flexibility has reduced UK unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK labour market is behaving with all the unpredictability of the
weather at Wimbledon. As the economy came out of recession, unemployment
began falling earlier than most experts had expected. It stopped falling
last summer, continued falling in the autumn, and then stopped again in
January.
At the core of most explanations for this erratic behaviour is the notion
that the labour market has experienced a significant change in flexibility.
The government says that its policies of promoting flexibility - by, for
instance, reducing the power of trade unions - are responsible for the
earlier than expected fall in the jobless total. That is the success story
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, was parading at the two-day Detroit job
summit yesterday.
Similarly, businessmen (see below) agree that increased flexibility explains
the unexpected fall in unemployment, though they claim the credit for
themselves. But critics say that far from being a straight-forward positive
development, flexibility has merely allowed full-time jobs to be repackaged
as part-time ones, creating an illusion of more work in the economy. Some go
further, adding that whatever the advantages of flexibility to individual
employers, it has the big disadvantage of increasing employee insecurity,
damaging consumer confidence in a fragile economy.
Amid the conflicting explanations, there is one certainty: unemployment has
been falling. Even using International Labour Organisation figures (which
are based on survey evidence and are judged a better indicator than the
government's unemployment benefit claimant statistics), the jobless total
fell by nearly 100,000 between winter 1992 and winter 1993. Most City
analysts expect that trend to continue when the government tomorrow
publishes its seasonally-adjusted total for February.
The main reason for falling unemployment has been a reduction in the flow of
people coming on to the jobs market. Companies have been sacking fewer
people and the number of young people coming on to the market is lower than
in the early 1980s, thanks to demographic changes and more pupils staying on
at school after reaching 16.
More debatable is whether many jobs are being created. This does not seem to
be the case in manufacturing, where employment has been sliding since 1968,
with only a slight upward blip in the late 1980s. In the economy as a whole,
there was a small increase of 67,000 in the number of employees in work
between January and September 1993, from 21.183m to 21.250m, according to
the Labour Force Survey, published by the Department of Employment.
But over the same period the number of full-time jobs fell by 40,000 and
part-time jobs increased by more than 100,000. Thus, when the figures are
calculated in terms of 'full-time equivalent' jobs, the increase is
negligible. Further supporting the conclusion that work is being spread
around rather than growing, are figures for working hours, which fell from
936m per week in 1992 to 927m in 1993 (the 1990 peak was just over 1bn).
The idea that work is being spread may seem beneficial, but many people are
being excluded: employment market experts say job losses are concentrated
among lower-skilled male workers whose partners do not work (voluntarily or
because the welfare system provides a disincentive to enter employment)
while new part-time jobs are in general being taken by women whose partners
are in work.
There is some evidence that the male share of part-time work is starting to
rise, as manufacturing follows the service sector in increasing its use of
part-time labour, but men still constitute only 15 per cent of the 5.9m
part-time workforce.
The government says, nevertheless, that growth in part-time employment is a
welcome development, shortening the time lag between changes in economic
output and unemployment levels. This has some truth to it - but is only part
of the story. According to a recent analysis by the US investment bank
Goldman Sachs, the main reason why unemployment fell faster after the end of
the latest recession than after the 1981-83 downturn was because the working
population was growing faster in the early 1980s.
Another important part of the improvement, was the result of a
'bounce-back'; over pessimistic employers shed labour too rapidly at the
time of the autumn 1992 European Exchange Rate Mechanism crisis and had to
increase employment when the impact on the economy turned out to be less
detrimental than feared. But it was also, says Goldman Sachs, due to an
improvement in labour market flexibility which led to employers taking on
more part-time workers instead of increasing overtime. As a result, the
average hours worked by full-time employees fell between summer 1992 and
summer 1993 from 36.6 hours a week to 36.3.
So is Mr Kenneth Clarke right to claim that the current government is
responsible for creating that more flexible market? If he is claiming credit
for the growth of part-time work, the answer is no. The weakening of union
power in the 1980s may have removed an obstacle to the increasing use of
part-timers and outside contractors. But many of the legislative and
financial incentives for employers to take on part timers - such as
exemption from many work-related benefits - have been largely unchanged for
25 years.
Moreover, contrary to the view that part-time work has only recently started
to accelerate, it increased at a slightly faster rate in the more regulated
and union-dominated labour market of the 1970s than in the 1980s. In 1971
the number of part-time employees was 3.3m or 15.3 per cent of all
employees, by 1981 the figure had jumped to 4.5m and 21.2 per cent of all
employees. By the end of 1991 the total had increased to 5.7m or 26.4 per
cent of all employees.
This suggests that the rise in part-time work is driven as much by broader
business and social trends - such as the growing demand of married women for
part-time employment - as by deregulation. For that reason this month's
House of Lords ruling, based on European Union law, that part-time workers
should have the same rights over redundancy pay and unfair dismissal as full
timers, may prove to have relatively little impact on demand for
part-timers.
However, the government can claim some credit for other factors which may be
contributing to job creating flexibility. The growing divergence between the
pay of skilled and less skilled workers, encouraged by measures such as the
abolition of wages councils, may have prevented demand for low skill labour
falling further.
The reduction in benefit payments relative to income from employment, may
also have encouraged some people to accept jobs which they would not have
done in the 1970s.
The government is on firmer ground in claiming credit for creating more
flexibility among those with jobs. Over the past decade, government-inspired
curbs on union power, as well as the shadow of high unemployment, has
certainly reduced resistance to moves by employers to take more control over
pay and working practices.
The corollary of this new flexibility within companies, according to some
analysts, is a pervasive insecurity in the British workplace. Mr Eric
Salama, joint managing director of the Henley Centre, says that the
combination of employment insecurity and the feeling that the state will no
longer provide for people is having a strong impact on consumer confidence
and savings. Nearly one-fifth of respondents to a recent Henley survey said
that concerns about job security had prevented them from making major
purchases in the last 12 months.
However, worries about greater insecurity in the workforce may be
exaggerated. Employment department figures on the number of people in
'atypical work' - casual, temporary, contract or seasonal - show a slight
fall over the past 10 years. The total fell from 1.08m in 1984 to 1.05m in
1993, although within that total, contract work has doubled to 600,000.
It may be that such statistics are not picking up other aspects of a more
flexible and less secure labour market: the increase in the proportion of
the working population who fear losing their jobs and the increase in
job-hopping.
But it may also be that consumer spending, now back at pre-recession levels,
can adjust to the new labour market flexibility thanks to the creativity of
the consumer finance industry, for example by adapting hire purchase schemes
to be more like leasing deals.
In any case, recent improvements in labour market flexibility are unlikely
to be reversed: as markets and technology change rapidly, the relationship
between employers and employees is becoming more fluid. The British
experience is that not everyone benefits; the picture is still of some
people moving into employment - but others moving out. That suggests
flexibility alone is insufficient to make a large dent in the unemployment
mountain.

<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Prowse ('A misguided focus on job creation', March 14) says
that 'inequality is simply the price we pay for a general level of
prosperity unimaginable under any other economic system'. I agree - though I
would argue about the levels of inequality he regards as necessary.
What I cannot agree with is his use of the word 'we'. Michael Prowse is not
paying the price of inequality, except perhaps in higher insurance premiums
for his car. This is not a rant against Mr Prowse, whose ear is usually
pretty close to the ground: who exactly pays the 'price' he describes is -
or should be - central to discussions on employment.
The debates in Detroit this week about the apparent trade-off between more
jobs and better jobs, the concerns of the Europeans and Americans
respectively, have missed at least half the point: who gets the jobs. If it
is the same individuals and families who suffer from market-generated
inequalities, the result is US-style ghettoisation, crime, fear and waste.
Spreading the pain around is as important as pain reduction.
An example of this crucial distributional issue in the UK is the growing gap
between 'work-rich' (two-earner) and 'work-poor' (no earner) families. The
jobs which have been created have been taken at the top by men, who work the
longest hours in Europe, and at the bottom by their over-qualified wives who
want to combine part-time paid work with looking after their children. This
trend is caused by the inflexibility of our welfare system and the
insistence of men to work such long hours (a million extra jobs could have
been created in the 1980s if working hours had continued declining).
Of course job creation is vital. But equally important is the efficient and
equitable functioning of labour markets. Governments can and should play an
important part in making this, the most important of all markets, work
better.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Clearing up an esoteric banking point
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN APPERLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Ms Isabel Ashman (Letters, March 10), like many others, may have been
confused by the, at times esoteric, debate on the clearing cycle. There are
two elements which have been confused: first, 'the amount of time it takes
before (a bank) pays interest on a cheque' ('Lloyds gives way on cheque
clearing', March 4) and, second, the amount of time before a customer can
use the funds.
Your article was correct in saying that Lloyds, Midland and NatWest will pay
interest two working days after the deposit of a cheque, which has long been
Barclays' practice. However, as cheques can still bounce after that time, it
takes longer until customers can use the money.
There are still variations between the banks, but the length of time cited
by Miss Ashman sounds correct for the circumstances at Barclays. The bank is
introducing new technology this year which will reduce the clearing time for
similar deposits.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Clinton's best chance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nobody, not even the most sceptical of us, should rejoice at US President
Bill Clinton's self-inflicted discomfiture. The spectacle of his proud wife,
Hillary, being obliged to justify herself in magazine interviews may satisfy
some, but it is not good news. When the White House is in trouble, everyone
is.
This proposition, which has informed western policy for the past 50 years,
remains true in spite of the end of the cold war and the subsequent
inability of President George Bush to establish a new world order. In
President Clinton, we have a reluctant internationalist, but our ultimate
dependence on the Americans remains the same. The US is no longer willing to
intervene in every country that falls victim to invasion or civil war, but
it is the only superpower we have. When its chief executive is distracted,
it affects every national interest.
You cannot get around this by saying that only the domestic programme now
before Congress will be affected by the debilitating atmosphere of suspicion
that has suddenly descended on the presidency. Mr Warren Christopher may fly
to China and Russia in an effort to produce a coherent foreign policy, but
that does not constitute evidence that the secretary of state's agenda has
the full attention of the White House. President Clinton's healthcare and
welfare bills are under greater immediate threat from Congress than his
inchoate foreign relations, but that does not alter the case. A US president
who is weak at home cannot be strong abroad. If he fails to get healthcare
through, Congress will be that much more difficult to persuade when he tries
to send US troops to keep an agreed peace in Bosnia.
To the question, 'is the US government on hold?' I was given a simple
one-word answer by White House officials last week. 'Yes.' The sudden
explosion of media interest in the Whitewater affair has left Mr Clinton
frustrated. Granted, he is not standing still. He is out and about, offering
a new initiative every day. A few days ago he was in New York, talking about
crime. Yesterday he was in Detroit, addressing the Group of Seven meeting on
employment. He spoke with his customary mastery of his subject. This is an
intelligent president, who is also a consummate practitioner of the
political arts. He is, you feel while in the US, permanently on TV. The
trouble is that, whenever he appears, he is asked about Whitewater.
Last week Georgia's President Eduard Shevardnadze had to stand silently by
Mr Clinton's side, squirming, while a press conference called to mark his
visit was turned into a Whitewater inquisition. When the US president is
with his staff at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, his quicksilver mind is
similarly diverted. He must pay attention to this or that strategy meeting
on how to get out of the mess. He has no overall chief to turn to, no
top-down command structure.
The Clinton White House is composed of loosely interlocking taskforces, ad
hoc seminars, groups and committees. 'That's why I don't believe the wild
accusations about bumping off Vince Foster,' one close observer said,
speaking of the Clinton associate who committed suicide. 'This lot would
still be debating how to do it, in a seminar.'
New presidents often get into difficulties in their first year or so. In
1980-81, President Ronald Reagan's officials were similarly disorganised. On
being told that messages from his staff conflicted with one another, Mr
Reagan remarked with his actor's rueful smile that 'in this White House, the
right hand sometimes doesn't know what the extreme right hand is doing'.
Mr Clinton is not yet ready to joke his way into happier times. The origin
of the Whitewater affair was a land deal in Arkansas some 15 years ago. Few
White House officials at any level doubt that some evasions of the civil law
occurred. Perhaps tax was tardily paid, or the influence of the then
governor Clinton was improperly used to protect his friends or his wife
Hillary, a partner in the state's most powerful law firm. As to the
subsequent clumsy at-tempts to conceal the details, everyone at the White
House agrees that this was a 'mistake'. Some even beg you to hear their
confessions. So far, so unserious. The trouble comes with the next layer of
speculation. Nobody I met will confidently affirm that Alabama-style petty
corruption and an attempt to hide it is the limit of the matter, that the
many harsher allegations, some involving criminal behaviour, will all prove
to be false. No one is, or can be, certain.
The consensus among experienced damage control advisers is that the best
policy is to get the whole story, every embarrassing detail of it, out as
quickly as possible. Let nothing be concealed. It is not clear that this has
yet been done, not even now, not after all that has happened. Mr Clinton
answers questions whenever he meets reporters, but at the weekend he was
tetchy when one such session touched on his tax statements. Mrs Clinton has
broken her silence by giving interviews, but it remains to be seen whether a
decision to put her on TV with her husband, taken in the White House last
Friday, is implemented.
The administration has co-operated with the special prosecutor, Mr Robert
Fiske. It has sent him the documents he asked for. The staff he has summoned
to appear before a grand jury have turned up, personal lawyers at their
sides. Against that, Democrats in Congress are resisting the idea of
committee hearings while Mr Fiske proceeds. This is technically sound, but
it looks odd from the very Democrats who harassed Mr Clinton's Republican
predecessors with hearing after hearing.
Yet Mr Clinton may not be permanently lamed by what has happened. He appears
to be taking the advice of greyer heads than the team of inspired
twentysomethings he brought in from his campaign. He could survive a quick
and not too damning report by Mr Fiske and the sacrifice of a few minor
officials, Mr Bernard Nussbaum and Mr Webster Hubbell being the first. The
Republicans may conclude that being totally obstructive in Congress would
rebound on them. Mrs Clinton could absorb most of the opprobrium. Mr Clinton
could stop trying to do too much at once, and succeed in what he focuses
upon.
That is the best-case scenario I was offered last week. It might come true,
absent further damaging disclosures. Keep your fingers crossed.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Cheap and cheerful: Changing patterns of Japanese retailing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Yukio Higuchi started Kawachiya, Japan's first discount liquor
store, 30 years ago, he had a hard time fending off gangsters sent by
competitors to loiter around his warehouse. Discounting was virtually
unheard of and shoppers were sceptical about the quality of his beers and
whiskies, drastically cheaper than in other retail outlets.
Today, however, his business in the east end of Tokyo is buoyant. Annual
sales have more than doubled over the past three years to Y15bn (Pounds
95.5m), and it is not the thugs he has trouble keeping out from his stores
anymore, but the swarm of shoppers attracted by the cheap prices.
Kawachiya is just one example of the many Japanese discount retailers now
experiencing a surge in sales. Hit by the sharp downturn of the economy and
subsequent declines in overtime and annual bonus payments, consumers have
curbed spending and are looking for bargains.
The shift in consumption patterns has begun to alter the archaic landscape
of Japan's retail industry. Until now, Japan's traditional small corner
shops and upmarket department stores have, unlike their western
counterparts, seen only limited competition from supermarkets and specialist
discounters.
The start of a shake-out is evident in the sharp rise in earnings of
discount retailers such as Aoyama, the men's suit retailer, which have used
their bulk purchasing power to cut prices and threaten manufacturers'
dominance. Taxable profits at the top five discounters last year were 94 per
cent higher than in 1990 (see chart).
Success has been at the expense of Japan's upmarket but sleepy department
stores, where sales fell an average of 2.5 per cent in January from the
previous year, the 23rd consecutive monthly decline. Mitsukoshi expects to
report losses for the year to the end of February, the second year in a row.
Apart from Japan's recession, several domestic and foreign factors account
for the rise of discount retailing: first, pressure from the US to cut
Japan's Dollars 8.26bn trade surplus has led to the deregulation of Japan's
multilayered distribution and retailing system.
In 1990 the Japanese government responded to US complaints by curbing the
'anti-competitive practices' employed by manufacturers to maintain retail
prices at artificially high levels.
In the past manufacturers would threaten to stop deliveries if a retailer
failed to apply the 'suggested retail price' set by the manufacturer. Not
surprisingly, the habit had proved intractable because the pre-set retail
price traditionally included profit margins for the four to five wholesalers
along the distribution line, all of which lost out when prices fell.
The reforms of three years ago gave more power to the Fair Trade Commission,
the country's previously toothless anti-monopoly watchdog, to clamp down on
overpricing.
The commission forced leading Japanese beer companies, including Kirin
Brewery and Asahi Breweries, to place advertisements in newspapers
announcing that retailers and wholesalers were allowed to set their own
prices. Last year, the commission told the sales subsidiaries of leading
consumer electronics companies, including Matsushita and Sony, to allow
retailers to discount their products without fear of losing supply
contracts.
American pressure for access to Japanese consumer markets can also take much
of the credit for liberalising the laws which protect small retailers from
new high street competitors. As a result, retailers can now open stores with
floor space of up to 1,000 square metres without the approval of the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry. Existing small shopkeepers,
often operating in premises of less than 100 square metres, tried
unsuccessfully to resist this change.
Second, the first foreign retailers to set up in Japan since the retailing
law was reformed in 1990, are breaking the links between the manufacturers
and the high street. In 1991, Toys 'R' Us, the US discount toy store chain,
became the first retailer to skip over the intricate web of wholesalers to
deal directly with one of its suppliers, Nintendo, the video game maker.
Toys 'R' Us undercut Japanese toy prices by leaving out the middle man. This
approach has gone down so well with customers that its Japanese turnover per
store is Dollars 15m to Dollars 20m a year, double the sales per store in
the US.
More foreign retailers can be expected to follow this example if only
because the number of wholesalers is expected to decline sharply through
bankruptcies and mergers. Britain's Marks &amp; Spencer, for example, and The
Gap, the US-based clothing chain - long accustomed to dealing directly with
their suppliers in their own markets - are expressing interest in Japan.
Third, the expansion of national supermarket chains with greater bulk
purchasing power has led to price cuts of imported clothing and foods. Some
supermarkets have seized on this advantage, magnified by the strength of the
yen, to promote their own discount brands. For example, Daiei, the country's
largest chain, has launched a private label orange juice imported from
Brazil at half the price of national brands. Now its own label product
accounts for 80 per cent of Daiei's total orange juice sales.
The company has been a pioneer of the profound changes affecting Japan's
conservative high streets. Mr Dean Perry, who studies the retail market for
Lehman Brothers, the broker, in Tokyo, says 'Walmart wannabes' will continue
to take market share from 'mom and pop' corner stores and department stores.
These are price-efficient discount chains modelling themselves after
Walmart, the largest discount chain in the US.
Mr Paul Heaton, retailing expert at Baring Securities in Tokyo, agrees that
the outlook for department stores is poor, but notes that their malaise may
not be terminal because they are flush with cash from many years of
overpricing.
Isetan, a leading department store, reckons that one way to attract
consumers is to specialise. So it has formed a joint venture with Barneys,
the upmarket fashion store in New York, to open a Tokyo shop for
high-fashion customers.
Most observers believe that Japanese retailing will follow a pattern similar
to that in the US in the 1980s, when the advance of supermarkets and
discount stores forced independent retailers to specialise, become more
efficient or go out of business. With structural changes in place and
consumers more aware of value than in the past, it is difficult to see how
the cozy, cartel-like links between manufacturers, distributors and
retailers can be reforged even when the country emerges from its present
slowdown.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Tougher entrance qualifications would
reduce student numbers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Rev Dr GEORGE WORTHINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'Open universities' (March 4) confronts the problem of
limited government funds for universities and the likely denial of places to
students wanting them. Your solution is to make students repay, in the
future out of their enhanced earnings, some of their tuition fees.
If you actually worked in a university, particularly one of the 'new' ones
(ex-polytechnics etc), you might well see the problem rather differently.
Seen from inside, the central fact is that in recent years there has been
great pressure from the government (mediated through vice-chancellors, deans
and so on, all on performance-related pay) to increase student numbers. This
has been achieved, first, by recruiting anyone who could be found with
remotely plausible qualifications (a couple of E grades at A level, for
example), and, second, by retaining those students whom one has got, almost
regardless of performance. The latter aim is achieved, among other methods,
by partially replacing exams with a mandatory minimum of 'continuous
assessment', that is project work done in the students' own time but all too
often not by their own unaided effort.
Added to all this is a Department of Education-inspired culture which
regards all failures by students to complete their courses as 'wastage'
which reflects badly on the university concerned. The result is a recipe for
the production of great numbers of poorly qualified graduates who may well
never achieve the higher incomes from which they will supposedly repay their
fees.
If numbers are now to be limited, the best way to do it, both for the sake
of equity and for the restoration of the quality of higher education, is to
toughen entrance qualifications. This should be to the point where getting
into university is once again seen by a young person's family and friends,
as it used to be, as a significant achievement rather than just a way of
keeping away from the dole queue. Exams should also be toughened within the
universities to the point where graduation is again seen by employers as
evidence of that young person's ability to work effectively, to reason
accurately, and to write grammatical English.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Wrong tune for the unskilled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr G M SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Professor Adrian Wood (Personal View, March 10) proposes stimulating
the employment of unskilled workers by increasing the cost of employing
skilled workers.
As the oldest piano maker in the world, we very much hope that this
imaginative idea is adopted in mainland Europe, where the professor believes
that there will be applause for his suggestion. The Wood plan should be of
great benefit to our export trade there since it would put up European costs
and prices and thus be disastrous for our local competitors.
However, given the risk that the Wood plan would simply add to the level of
unemployment in Europe by the collapse of the businesses which employ the
expensive skilled workers, perhaps that would not be to our benefit. With
growing unemployment, maybe the Europeans would not be able to afford our
pianos after all. I suggest that the professor is encouraged to study the
problem of unskilled unemployment again and to ask himself whether a better
answer is to increase the demand for skilled workers and thus provide an
incentive for the unskilled to be trained. Or is that too American for him
to tolerate?

FT  15 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: In step with most intense competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From W N S CALVERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You comment in your leading article on Europe's competitiveness ('How
Europe can compete', March 9) that the poorest performance among European
industries is in those most exposed to international competition.
This is the reverse of the truth in the case of Europe's footwear industry.
Unlike textiles, it has had no protection and yet has stood up to formidable
low-cost competition far better than its US and Japanese equivalents. This
is despite a severe handicap in exporting in that most third countries,
including those with the most competitive industries, do not themselves
accept imports. As a result EU footwear production has inevitably fallen.
However, a recent study carried out by Brussels showed that, given
world-wide free trade, this fall would actually be reversed.
The industry has stood up well because it produces the world's best shoes,
and because it has adapted skilfully to its ruinous trade environment. But
it will only thrive if Brussels becomes much more determined than hitherto
to win for it a level playing field in international trade.

unable even to organise a little peace-keeping mission. Somali warlord
General Aidid talks to Margaret Gilmour in Assignment (7.45 BBC2). Judging
by last week's episode, Channel 4's new series about the law, The Brief, is
ready to adopt its own editorial stance. For instance, having sought out an
interviewee the reporter may ask a question and then shout down the answer,
which is a novel technique (8.30 C4).
40 Minutes investigates the destruction of Freddie Laker's Skytrain scheme
in 1982: was he brought down by his own ambition? 'No, I was shafted' he
says, and of course BA and other airlines did have to settle with him (9.45
BBC2).
Hedd Wyn is a 130-minute historical drama in Welsh with subtitles, telling
the story of a young Welsh poet who dreams of winning the prize at the
National Eisteddfod (10.35 C4). Omnibus screens a revised version of Leslie
Megahey's 1972 portrait of Goya (11.00 BBC1).

FT  15 MAR 94 / Arts: Hidebound by rhetoric - William Packer castigates the
organisers of 'Unbound: Possibilities in Painting'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has to be said at once that Unbound, which with Dali: The Early Years,
makes up the spring double-header at the Hayward, is as dispiriting and
misbegotten an exhibition as could be contrived. What makes it worse, if
that is possible, is that it raised beforehand a certain curiosity and even
a few hopes. Subtitled Possibilities in Painting, it promised the work of
some 14 artists from around the world united only in 'their passionate
devotion to the physical, intellectual and emotional range offered by
painting.' We should have known better.
In the event it proves to be a celebration only of the kind of painting that
fits the narrowest curatorial interest, which may be characterised as the
orthodoxy of the conceptual avant-garde. We are in a time in which, as the
Hayward's publicity material puts it, 'galleries . . . are reporting an
upsurge of interest in paintings', to which disingenuous remark there are
two things to say. There is no such upsurge of interest for the simple
reason that there was never a downsurge: painting continues as it has always
been, a principal means by which artists express their engagement with their
experience of the world. Had there been one, however, any such downsurge
would have been brought about precisely by the curatorial myopia and
theoretical narrowness that such a show as this represents. As for the poor
punter, he would be forgiven for never wanting to see 'a possible painting'
ever again.
The ploy is this. Since, to the sincere and educated curator of contemporary
art, the only art to be respected is that sanctioned by its engagement with
the currency of the avant-garde: and since that present currency is
insistently conceptual - that is to say idea led - and since painting,
stubborn as ever, won't go away: what to do? Why, shoe-horn it somehow or
other into that fixed set of received principles. That done, the position is
secure from all attack - heads, we win: tails, you lose. 'Those who treat
painting precisely as an 'old-time religion', and they are endemic,
especially in Britain,' writes Adrian Searle in his catalogue apologia for
himself and his colleague, Greg Hilty, 'will find little comfort here. This
is not a return to order but a breaking of bounds.'
But what of those of us who treat painting as, well, painting? Let us take a
work by the German, Imi Knoebel ' . . . at first sight (it) seems nothing
more than a blank sheet of plywood, pinned to the wall . . . it is a
painting which has turned its back to us: it is the reverse side of a
painted panel . . . it comprises several paintings sandwiched together,
paintings we shall never see.' Hmmm: and that makes the painter himself so
special? Indeed. 'He works between positions, and with all positions: he
works with dualities, oppositions, repetitions and contradictions. He does
not so much have a repertoire of painting, as scrutinise what a repertoire
means. His work is rigorous . . . ' And is it for him or us to turn a face
to the wall, and weep?
It is easy enough to mock, but necessary. Take the American, Jonathan
Lasker, whose practise is to over-lay simple abstract figures, one upon
another - grids, whirls and pictograms, all drawn with a self-conscious
clumsiness. His has been, 'a scrutiny of intention and order in painting,
and yet his work is filled with paradox . . . the final mark . . . as much a
denial, or cancellation . . . as it is a summation.' Raoul de Keyser, a
Belgian, presents a suite of small canvases, each painted with a perfunctory
simplicity, the image sometimes roughly gestural but more often a set of
rectangles, ambiguous blocks or apertures within the picture-plane. They
have 'the concentration of a stare . . . they are full of impetuosity and
strangeness . . . the activity of painting is often a series of delays . . .
(undermined) with some reckless manoeuvre . . .'
So the special pleading goes on. Michael Krebber, another German, offers
imagery of an almost cynical ineptitude, its significance, we are told
approvingly, 'jeopardised by the abject manner of its description . . . What
we are offered . . . is snatched back, in repeated acts of
self-consumption.' What do we learn of our own Zebedee Jones, and his
'opaque, all-over, single-hued surfaces'? 'The light in the paintings is
fugitive, depending on how one stands in relation to the object', which is a
great help.
The presence of Peter Doig and Fiona Rae in such company is a surprise, that
of Paula Rego oddest of all, for whatever else they might be, they are all
true painters in something more than the mechanical and process-driven sense
so dear to the selectors. But Doig won the John Moores Prize last autumn,
Fiona Rae has been a Turner Prize contender, and Paula Rego presents the
acceptable face of narrative painting, so it was safe enough to put them in.
But for the 'Possibilities of Painting' that they adumbrate in their work,
we are far more likely to find them relished and explored at the Summer Show
of the Royal Academy than ever at the Hayward.
Unbound: Possibilities in Painting, Hayward Gallery, South Bank Centre SE1,
until May 30.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Arts: Stars shine at Nureyev gala night - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pirouettes by the million. Stars by the score. Enough emotion to float a
battle-cruiser. The great, the good, the generous, from ballet and theatre.
An audience ready to rejoice, and in the process to help the charity
CRUSAID. And the spirit of Rudolf Nureyev to unite us all. Thus Sunday
night's gala, in which something of Nureyev's unique and uniquely potent
presence was again to hold a packed theatre in thrall.
Derek Deane, to whom all praise, masterminded a show that sought - and
successfully found - a way to say something about Nureyev's life and work.
So such eminent figures as Vanessa Redgrave and Nigel Hawthorne, Alan Bates,
John Schlesinger, Jayne Torvill, Stephen Fry; such dance colleagues as
Sibley and Dowell, Lynn Seymour and David Wall, Dame Beryl Grey and Sir
Peter Wright - among many others - spoke of him, and introduced, with
miraculous brevity, dancers from around the world in works which reflected
Nureyev's attainments or his tastes.
Any commentary on a gala inevitably reads like a laundry list. I simply note
certain high-lights in an evening that went with exemplary smoothness,
astonishing speed (ah, memories of those galas that seemed to take place
during a go-slow by time itself), and enormous good humour. There was Irek
Mukhamedov to frame Nureyev's career in the West: appearing first in an
evocation of the Poeme tragique in which Nureyev raced into our lives, and
closing the show with Liz Robertson in 'Shall we dance' from The King and I,
and making us want to see him in the entire thing.
The Paris Opera paid grand homage to its erstwhile director, with Elisabeth
Platel impeccable in La Bayadere, partnered by the prodigious Nicolas Le
Riche, making his London debut. Also from the Opera, Charles Jude, looking
hauntingly like Nureyev, in a solo to Beethoven; Isabelle Guerin and Laurent
Hilaire very dashing in Sleeping Beauty; and Elizabeth Maurin leading in
triumph a group of young dancers who fizzed and whizzed, spun and spun
again. They were angels all, with Johan Kobborg, Yat Seng Chang, Giuseppe
Picone flying in the face of gravity, and Ambra Vallo and Marta Barahona
sparkling alongside them.
Darcey Bussell was thrilling in Balanchine's Tchaikovsky pas de deux; Igor
Zelensky (from St. Petersburg) was truly Balanchine's Apollo - serious,
powerful - and Evelyn Hart and Rex Harrington from Canada were all emotion
in Kylian's Nuages, a duet admired by Nureyev. Makarova found herself
high-kicking with Kermit the Frog (and Miss Piggy, not the least of
Nureyev's partners, we recall, in buoyant attendance), and Nureyev's Romeo
and Juliet was touchingly evoked by Agnes Oaks and Thomas Edur in the
balcony duet. His tremendous appearances in the Corsaire duet were
remembered through Tetsuya Kumakawa and Miyako Yoshida on transcendental
form.
There was more. And more. Stephen Fry confessed that he didn't think he
could ever have been a dancer - describing his possible dance-self as
looking like 'a bin-liner filled with yoghurt'. I must point out,
encouraging as always, that this is the ideal physique sought by some
post-modern troupes. Alan Bates was a sensitive guide to the one
heart-tearing moment of the evening - a collage of film clips showing
Fonteyn and Nureyev. We all wiped the eye.
But it was, in essence, a celebration of Nureyev's work and art, and as
audiences knew throughout the world during his career, we left the theatre
exhilarated by him, and by his influence on dancing. The programme book for
the evening was most handsome, and a worthy reminder of him. And for anyone
wishing to help CRUSAID's work, in memory of Nureyev's contribution to their
joy in the theatre, contributions please to CRUSAID at 1 Walcott Street,
London SW1P 2NG.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Arts: Revivals and rarities - Opera in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN and DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A recent Arts Council report complained that English National Opera had an
insufficient stock of 'revivable productions'. There are no problems for the
Royal Opera there: by taking fewer risks in the 1970s and '80s the company
has furnished itself with a good number of productions that it can bring
back again and again.
The present production of Un ballo in maschera has been treading the boards
since 1975. It has acquired some fussy stage business lately, but in visual
terms its appeal grows. Verdi's opera is set emphatically in the
18th-century Sweden for which it was originally intended, a land of cold
gloomy nights and plain interiors. It was a clever idea to design the sets
in the style of those at Gustavus's own theatre at Drottningholm, finally
revealed in the masked ball of the title.
The theme of people in disguise is woven right through the plot, but it is
no good any production hoping to dress up second-rate singers. With the
Russian soprano Nina Rautio the only surprise is that such a small frame
should hide such a big voice. She is not masquerading as a Verdi soprano -
the top of the voice is tremendous, unfettered and powerful. Lower down a
lack of Italianate colour is a hindrance, but her Amelia makes an undeniable
impact.
Unlike some sopranos, she has the grace not to dwarf Dennis O'Neill's short
but sturdy Gustavus. This is one of the tenor's more effective roles,
although crude Italianate effects still lie alongside phrases that are
shaped with genuine style. Paolo Coni was overparted as Anckarstrom. His
bright, youthful baritone has to stretch to its limit to reach the
appropriate level of gravity. Both men sounded strained at the big moments,
though for different reasons.
There was an Ulrica of some class from Jane Henschel, the fast vibrato an
unusual feature, but not unappealing. Judith Howarth has all Oscar's solos
under her belt, but never really makes them sparkle. The music Verdi gives
her asks to dazzle with its brilliance, which Daniele Gatti made sure it did
in the pit. The liveliness of his conducting would be welcome if it was not
bought at the price of exaggerated speeds.
Unfortunately, the generation of Italian conductors born baton in hand with
an innate command of Verdian style seems to be dying out, as are Italian
singers with voices on a grand opera scale. Today they eat pizza in Moscow,
but Russian singers sing Verdi at La Scala. That is the free market in the
late 20th-century.
*****
For London opera-lovers, the Chelsea Opera Group does indispensable service
of a high order: it unearths, or dusts off, semi-forgotten pieces whose time
may have come, or come again. It does that on best advice, with scrupulous
preparation and a happy marriage of rising professional soloists with its
own semi-pro orchestra and chorus. Sometimes its efforts inspire grander
revivals; but the COG's thrifty concert-performances are still dependably
rewarding in their own right.
At the Queen Elizabeth Hall on Saturday we heard The Nightingale, by the
32-year-old Stravinsky, and the 34-year-old Bizet's Djamileh: not really a
close match, though both are Eastern-exotic exercises. Stravinsky's music
for his fairytale China drifts between Slav folk-fantasy and percussive
barbarism in the vein of Le Sacre - which he had composed between starting
and finishing this miniature opera. The one-act Djamileh is pure French
operetta.
The Nightingale hardly needs rediscovering, for every few years somebody
puts it on with the rich costumes and balletic ritual that are part of its
conception. Despite its switch of styles in midstream, which used to be
thought a decisive fault, it has come to occupy - hauntingly - its own
unique niche in the canon. The plain COG performance, in English, justified
itself through Michael Lloyd's well-paced conducting, Eileen Hulse's lovely,
fluid delivery of the Nightingale's coloratura music, David Barrell's solid
character as the Emperor and Philip Sheffield's coolly fervent
Fisherman-narrator.
Sheffield came into his own in Djamileh, as the hedonistic young Caliph of
Cairo who smokes, drinks and gambles as if there were no tomorrow, and
expects a new slave-girl mistress every month. If there are young French
tenors who can match Sheffield's well-arched, period-stylish legato, bright
diction and disarmingly fresh timbre, I have not heard them. He promises to
be an invaluable performer in this repertoire.
As Djamileh herself, the lovelorn current slave-girl who longs to stay on
indefinitely, Margaret McDonald was tremulous and chaste as only a British
mezzo can be. Barrell gave us a ripe Splendiano, the Caliph's cynical
accountant-cum-procurer. The whole romance floated charmingly, and wanted
only some tacky 'exotic' dancing to fill it out. If Bizet's score is
lightweight, its chromatic inventions reach beyond anything in his earlier
Pearl Fishers (currently at the ENO, and warmly recommended). Here Djamileh
made a bracing listen, no less illuminating than engaging: another COG
success.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Law Society's governing council last week adopted a proposal by the
Association of Women Solicitors to enhance maternity rights to women law
firm partners, as part of its model anti-discrimination policy. The move is
in line with maternity rights for all women employees under the 1978
Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act. Equity partners, not being
employees, fall outside the statutory protection.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Business and the Law: US legal system not consulted by 40%
of low earners - Legal briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Each year roughly half of low and moderate income households in the US face
a legal problem but most of them do not consult a lawyer or turn to the
civil justice system. According to the National Law Journal, a US legal
magazine, a survey commissioned by the American Bar Association discovered
that more than 40 per cent of households in both income groups attempted to
resolve problems on their own, while 38 per cent of the low-income
households did nothing at all. Asked why they took no action, respondents
said they 'thought nothing could be done'. The most common reason given by
respondents for not consulting a lawyer or using the civil justice system
was they 'did not think it would help'.
In 71 per cent of cases where a legal need was identified by low-income
households and 61 per cent in middle-income households, the civil justice
system had not been involved. Most common legal problems were debt and
consumer issues; housing; personal injury; and family and domestic
relations. Mr R William, ABA president, said the inability to resolve such
problems simply because Americans did not have access to appropriate help
was 'a national tragedy'.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Business and the Law: When only direct challenge is valid -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Individuals who do not take up their rights to challenge European Commission
decisions by bringing direct actions in the European Court of Justice cannot
later challenge them by way of a reference from a national court to the ECJ
for a ruling on a preliminary point of law, the Court ruled last week.
The case concerned the payment of state aid to a German textile company
about which the Commission had not been notified and which was therefore
declared unlawful. The German government was ordered to seek restitution of
the money. A copy of the Commission decision was sent to the company by the
Federal economics minister who advised the company it could challenge the
decision by a direct action in the ECJ.
No such proceedings were brought either by the company or the German
authorities. More than six months later, the Federal economics minister
withdrew the decisions to grant the aid, in compliance with the Commission
decision.
The company brought proceedings for judicial review in the national courts
against the minister's decision. The proceedings were dismissed at first
instance. The company appealed, claiming that the aid in question had been
partially compatible with the Rome treaty rules and that this vitiated, at
least in part, the Commission decision declaring the whole package unlawful.
The company claimed that it was entitled to invoke this claim despite the
fact that the limitation period for bringing a direct action before the
European Court of Justice had expired. The appeal court referred the issue
to the European Court for a preliminary ruling.
The Court set out its own jurisprudence on the issue. First, it said a
decision which had not been challenged in a direct action by its addressee
within the limitation period set down in the Rome treaty became definitive.
Second, a company benefiting from an individual state aid which was the
subject of a Commission decision was entitled to bring a direct action
before the ECJ challenging it, even if the decision was addressed to a
member state.
The Court said time limits set out in the Rome treaty for direct actions
applied equally to member states and individuals. Thus, a member state which
failed to bring a direct action within the limitation period could not
challenge the validity of a decision thereafter. The reason for this was
that the imposition of limitation periods safeguarded legal certainty by
avoiding the situation whereby Union acts could be challenged indefinitely.
The Court then ruled that the same reasons led it to exclude the possibility
of an individual beneficiary of state aid challenging a Commission decision
by attacking the national measures taken to ensure compliance with it, where
that individual had had the opportunity to challenge the Commission decision
directly before the ECJ but had failed to do so. If it were otherwise, the
Court continued, the individual would be changing the definitive nature of
the Commission decision.
The Court distinguished the present case from previous ones in which it had
ruled that the mere fact that a direct action had been brought before it did
not stop the same party from bringing an action before the national courts
in order to challenge national acts executing the decision which formed the
basis of the direct challenge. The Court pointed out that in these previous
cases, direct action had been brought by the individuals concerned.
The Court also distinguished another case, in which it had ruled that an
individual was entitled to challenge the legality of a Commission decision
by challenging a national act taken pursuant to that Commission decision.
The Court stated that the only act capable of being challenged by the
individual in that case was the national act and that the individual had the
right to challenge such decisions indirectly before the national courts when
direct action was not available. In the present case, the individual was
made fully aware of the Commission decision and the possibility of
challenging it directly.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Jan Hall (below) has joined the board of travel group Owners Abroad, whose
top management is being restructured under the leadership of Francis Baron,
its new chief executive.
Hall's experience of branding makes her a useful non-executive find for
Owners Abroad. For the past 10 years, she has been chairman of Coley Porter
Bell, a corporate and brand indentity consultancy which became part of the
WPP group in 1989. Hall, 36, recently left the company.
Baron, who took over late last year, has said he wants to trim the group's
diverse and confusing holiday brands, which include Sovereign, Enterprise,
Falcon and Sunmed. He is also pondering changing the name of the group. The
Owners Abroad label dates back to the company's original business, which was
selling flights to people who owned holiday homes abroad.
One of Hall's final projects at Coley Porter Bell was to oversee a branding
project for Airtours, Owners Abroad's rival. Her former company helped
Airtours come up with Going Places, the new name for its Pickfords Travel
and Hogg Robinson travel agency chains. Hall says she has assured Airtours
that no confidential information will be passed on to Owners Abroad.

FT  15 MAR 94 / People: Wellings proves there is a profitable after-life
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fred Wellings, 52, who has seen more building industry booms and busts than
most of his stockbroking colleagues, has proved that there can be a
profitable after-life for ageing stockbroking analysts. He quit being a
full-time broker on his 50th birthday, and has carved out a new career as
consultant, author and non-executive director.
Berkeley Group, the successful UK housebuilder, has just appointed Wellings
to its board. He has been working for the firm as a consultant for a couple
of years. Wellings has also recently published his first textbook,
Construction Equities: Evaluation and Trading, and is correcting the proofs
of a company history of Marley. His next project is a bibliography of
banking history.
Wellings, who also acts as a consultant for accountants Robson Rhodes and
stockbrokers Credit Lyonnais Laing, started his city career with Phillips &amp;
Drew in 1962 and spent time with J &amp; A Scrimgeour before ending up at Laing
&amp; Cruikshank. 'When I started every analyst was required to cover three or
four sectors. Now there are three or four analysts per firm covering each
sector,' says Wellings, who has no regrets about his mid-life career switch.
He's not the first building analyst to move into the industry. Bob Erith,
55, who covered the building industry at Savory Milln for many years, sits
on the board of Crest Nicholson.

FT  15 MAR 94 / People: McKinnon to chair T. Cowie
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir James McKinnon, previously director general of Ofgas, the gas industry
regulatory body, has been appointed non-executive chairman of T. Cowie, the
motor finance and retailing group with a turnover of Pounds 800m.
His appointment, which takes immediate effect, reflects the enhanced
influence on Cowie policy of chief executive Gordon Hodgson since the
company's forceful founder and chairman Sir Tom Cowie retired last year.
Until now Cowie has had only one non-executive director at a time on its
board. The company is now seeking a third, to join Sir James and Lord
Elliott of Morpeth, until now the only one; an announcement is expected
shortly.
A spokesman says Cowie believes non-execs can bring a valuable outside
perspective. Sir James had been chosen because of his extensive city
experience and the 'right chemistry' with Hodgson. Both, said the spokesman,
were self-made men from modest backgrounds who had trained as accountants.
'They both have a forthright and frank manner.'
Sir James, 64, was earlier this month recruited as chairman of
Trafficmaster, a provider of in-car traffic information, which is to be
floated. Currently he chairs MAI, the money, securities and television
company, is deputy chairman of Scotia Holdings (pharmaceuticals), chairman
of Ionica (radio telecommunications) and a non-executive director of Admiral
(computer services, systems development and software). His Cowie role is
expected to take up four to five days a month.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Business and the Law: Fight to take case to trial - The
challenge to solicitors' sole conduct of litigation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recent reforms of the legal profession are beginning to bear fruit. Five
years after Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, launched his ambitious plans
to find 'new or better ways of providing (legal) services and a wider choice
of persons providing them', traditional demarcation lines are breaking down.
Solicitors have been granted the right to appear as advocates in the higher
courts. The Bar is considering allowing the public direct access to
barristers. And four organisations, the Institute of Licensed Debt
Practitioners, the Institute of Commercial Litigators, the Chartered
Institute of Patent Agents and the Institute of Legal Executives have
applied to the Lord Chancellor's advisory committee on legal education and
conduct for limited advocacy rights or the right to conduct litigation.
The threat posed to the Bar by solicitor advocates has been apparent for
some time, but challenges to solicitors' monopoly on the preparation of
cases for trial - the so-called conduct of litigation - are new.
Solicitors have little to fear from three of the institutes. The debt
practitioners want litigation and advocacy rights in unopposed debt work in
the county courts. Patent agents, who already hold advocacy rights in the
patents County Court, want litigation rights in the High Court. Legal
executives, who have some rights as solicitors', representatives in chambers
hearings want extended rights for limited areas of work in open court.
The application by the Institute of Commercial Litigators is a different
proposition, however. The ICL was founded by construction consultants James
R Knowles and Bucknall Austin and by chartered quantity surveyors Cyril
Sweett, Tweeds and Beard Dove. It is seeking the right to conduct litigation
in building, construction and engineering matters, including negligence
disputes, in the High Court (mainly the Official Referee's Court), county
courts and in any appeals.
If its application is approved by the advisory committee and subsequently by
the Lord Chancellor and England's four senior judges, members of the
institute could pose a considerable threat to the solicitors' monopoly in
lucrative construction and building litigation.
The construction industry is the largest in the UK with an annual turnover
of some Pounds 30bn, employing around 1.3m people. Construction contracts
can be extremely complex involving employers, main contractors and
sub-contractors working closely with architects, quantity surveyors and
consulting engineers. Problems unique to the construction industry such as
bad weather, unsuitable ground conditions, combined with others such as
design problems and material failures, result in disputes. These disputes,
which often involve complex technical matters, and issues of fact and law,
occur regularly.
Patrick Lineen, Knowles's finance director and a director and founder member
of the ICL, estimates that the construction/building disputes market is
worth about Pounds 150m a year. Construction consultants and quantity
surveyors already take about 30 per cent of that market through their
conduct of arbitrations. They both prepare claims and present them on behalf
of contractor clients. But if a dispute goes to litigation, the conduct of
the case must be relinquished to a solicitor.
This is what construction consultants object to. Mr Lineen says there is
little appreciable difference between preparing a case for arbitration and
preparing it for trial. But more importantly construction clients dislike
the duplication of effort and additional cost when a dispute goes to court.
Paul Jensen, deputy managing director of Knowles, says the advantages to
construction clients of being able to use construction consultants and
quantity surveyors as 'one stop shops' for disputes are clear. He says it is
more economical to brief one group rather than two, consultants are cheaper
than solicitors, and there is a technical affinity between consultant and
client which rarely exits between construction client and solicitor.
'When a client comes to us with a potential dispute involving complex
technical issues we understand the problem immediately, whereas for most
solicitors who don't possess the necessary expertise there is a learning
curve for which the client is paying,' he says.
There is no shortage of legal skills either. Of 186 consulting staff at
Knowles, 26 have law degrees in addition to industry qualifications, 18 are
barristers and 81 are associates or fellows of the Chartered Institute of
Arbitrators.
The ICL's application was put together over 15 months and has been very
carefully pitched. Its professional conduct, discipline and complaints rules
are based on those of the Law Society. Training for those wishing to become
fellows of the ICL would be handled by the University of Bristol under the
guidance of Professor Malcolm Furmston and would follow the approach
currently taken by the Law Society and the Bar - a skills-based course
followed by a period of supervised on-the-job training.
Consultants and quantity surveyors who are already dual qualified as
barristers or solicitors would have to pass an exam on Commercial court
procedures, plug any gaps in their specialist knowledge and undergo a period
of supervised training.
The application is at first sight difficult to fault. But the ICL expects
strong opposition from solicitors. John Bishop chairman of the 200-strong
Official Referee's Solicitors Association and senior partner of Masons, one
of the leading construction litigation law firms, regards competition from
non-solicitors for the right to conduct litigation as 'inevitable and
probably a good thing'.
Provided they are competing with solicitors on level terms by complying with
similar standards of training and conduct he is happy to let the market
place decide. But he says: 'I'd be surprised in the short- and medium-term
if they could match the experience and expertise that solicitors have in
managing major litigation.'
Andrew Lockley, head of the Law Society's legal practice directorate, says
there are some obvious concerns. He foresees problems with the ICL's low
membership - five members at present - and its lack of experience in
training or regulating members.
'It seems odd that they haven't asked their various professional bodies,
such as the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, with good track records
to apply on their behalf,' he says.
He also foresees a problem in preserving the integrity of expert witnesses.
The ICL seems happy for consultants to conduct litigation and instruct a
member of their own firm as an expert witness, he says.
'It would not be possible for a solicitor, other than in very special
circumstances, to provide a witness from his or her firm and certainly not
an expert. If it is not prohibited by the rules of this institute we would
have very grave concerns,' he says.
Mr Lineen is sanguine about these grumbles. The ICL is prepared to leave it
to the advisory committee, which will at the end of this week put the
application out to consultation. The institute should have a better idea of
its chances of success by the autumn. Mr Lineen says that if the green light
is given it will begin a recruitment drive. He says other industry sectors
such as property, shipping and supply industries might also benefit from
similar rights, and the ICL is budgeting for more than 1,000 members within
five years.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Technology: Science brought down to earth - A programme to
promote terrestrial uses of innovations developed for space missions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MIRANDA EADIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For two decades, space technology has provided innovative technical
solutions to everyday problems as well as making glamorous space exploration
missions possible. The European Space Agency (ESA) has realised, however,
that many more earth-based uses for space technology could be found in
fields such as medicine, electronics, communications, energy and materials
science.
Everyday examples of space technology transfer, the process of applying
innovations developed for particular space missions for earth-based use,
include the anti-scratch protective layer on plastic contact lenses,
air-filled soles of high-tech running shoes, aluminium foil, digital clocks
and microwave ovens.
Although technology transfer has occurred informally in space research for
several years, many potential terrestrial applications remain unexploited.
Lack of time, and tunnel vision on the part of research engineers, are two
of the main reasons for this.
ESA therefore initiated a technology transfer programme in October 1991,
with the aim of identifying space technologies that might have civil or
commercial applications, and encouraging their transfer.
The initiative is run by Spacelink Europe, a consortium of technology
brokers from the UK (JRA Aerospace), France (Novespace), Germany (MST
Aerospace) and Italy (D'Appolonia).
Spacelink scouts ESA contractors for possible transfers, catalogues the
ideas, contacts non-space companies which may be interested, and eventually
negotiates a deal and takes care of inquiries.
The Spacelink catalogue, featuring the space technologies available for
exploitation, is called Test (Transferable European Space Technologies) and
is published annually. The latest edition, Test 3, contains 60 technologies
in many fields such as optics, sensors, communications, life sciences and
robotics. Including the earlier catalogues, there are 170 technologies on
offer.
Spacelink's objective is for non-space companies to sign a licensing
agreement or form a joint venture with the 'owner' of the technology. This
is either the ESA contractor, ESA itself or shared between the two. The
technology may be protected by a patent, but this is not always necessary to
license the technology.
Although one of the original goals of the programme was for it to become
self-financing, through licensing and technology transfer services, its main
aim is not economic benefit but to show that space is not just for sending
rockets but can have applications on earth.
Anne Marie Hieronimus-Leuba, head of ESA's space com- mercialisation office,
says that it is 'more concerned with showing that investment in space is
paying dividends in terms of terrestrial applications, and that it is not
just about sending beautiful objects into space'.
The ESA also hopes the programme will increase each of the member states'
financial return and share in the technology spin-off. It is an ESA policy
that each accounting unit paid by a member state into the agency budget
awarding industrial contracts should eventually flow back to that member
state.
The direct terrestrial applications of space research (weather forecasting,
communications via satellites, satellite television, etc) are more evident
than the indirect ones, or spin-offs, which do appear in nearly all fields
of science and technology: lucid image processing software, developed for
use in remote sensing, has applications in the security forces in number
plate detection, face recognition and fingerprint analysis; Aerocoat fire
protection materials, developed to protect equipment on the Ariane space
rocket from very high local temperatures generated during the launch phase,
are now used to protect sensitive equipment in trains for the Channel tunnel
link; human waste management systems, developed for use in space, are now
being considered for hospital clean rooms, where hygiene is also a priority;
Cream (Cosmic Radiation Effects and Activation Monitor), developed for the
Nasa Space Shuttle, has been adapted for high flying aircraft and fitted to
Concorde; and Radfets, miniature real-time radiation dosimeters, used to
monitor background radiation on ESA spacecraft, are being developed to
measure radiation doses during cancer treatment.
'Technology transfer is a very slow process and financial return cannot be
expected in less than four years,' says John Rootes, managing director of
JRA Aerospace. 'There is a time delay of about a year and a half between the
initial contact with a technology, the definition of the licensing agreement
and the signing of a contract. A further two years is then needed for the
adaptation, testing and fabrication of the technology.'
Although the process is traditionally slow, the programme has advanced more
rapidly than expected. When it began, the goal was to secure six transfers
in the first three years.
The fact that nine have already been agreed (and that there are many more in
the pipeline) indicates great prospects for the programme. The rapidity of
these transfers can, in part, be explained by the fact that 40 per cent of
them have occurred in the field of software engineering where transfer
modifications are minimal.
ESA invested Pounds 2m in the programme at its conception. The majority of
this is used to pay the members of Spacelink to run the programme but,
occasionally, if a transfer looks interesting and there is a shortage of
finance to carry it out, ESA may offer some financial support.
This was the case at the Brunel Institute of Bioengineering, where shape
memory alloys, originally used to make linear actuators for a space
bioprocessing facility, showed prospects in medicine as 'staples' to mend
broken bones.
The institute received Pounds 12,000 from ESA to develop these staples, and
general advice was given with regard to the technology transfer. Financial
support was also gained by AEA Technology after the huge interest shown in
its solid lubricants which appeared in Test 1: Pounds 5,600 was donated to
help pay for a short study into possible terrestrial applications.
Tony Anson, the research engineer at Brunel, is an 'enthusiast' of the
programme. He says that besides the programme being an encouraging
initiative, the financial support is 'extremely welcome in a country like
the UK where the government does not have a particularly philanthropic
approach towards research and where there is a dire shortage of funding'. He
believes he has a dozen or so technologies which could realistically have a
considerable impact in the medical field, if only he could find the money to
exploit them.
One of these is the use of shape memory alloys as a prosthesis for hole in
the heart. Other transfers which have taken place as a result of the
programme include: high stiffness composites developed by Dornier to build
space structures for the Rosat X-ray satellite, which are now used for
ground-based telescope reflectors and for large screens needed for training
systems; ESA's software standards, which have been adopted by many space and
non-space companies and which are about to be published by Prentice Hall for
worldwide distribution; and image processing software, developed to analyse
astronomical images, such as those from Hubble, licenced by Photek for
possible application in an image intensification camera.
This camera, which contains a Swedish optical chip, again identified through
the programme, could be used for research into arthritis and cancer. The
latter examples demonstrate the range of applications for space technology
and highlight how separate European initiatives can combine for common good.
ESA ultimately hopes that space industries themselves will strive to
identify potential technology transfers as early as possible in the R&amp;D
stage. Such lateral thinking should lead to joint development schemes and
more marketable products.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Technology: From Jurassic Park to Gatwick Airport - The
clarity of computer-generated designs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The graphics design technology that produced the animation in blockbuster
films Jurassic Park and Batman is now being used to help to design
'environments' such as the interiors of buildings.
British Rail's InterCity division got together with design consultants PSD
Associates of Isleworth, Middlesex, to redesign the facade of the Gatwick
Express station at the London airport's north terminal.
The brief was simple: to make the entrance immediately noticeable. 'We
wanted something with a bit of life, a bit of interest, a bit of sparkle,'
explains Simon Brazier, InterCity's architectural business manager.
Using a Silicon Graphics workstation and software from Alias, PSD designed a
number of options for the new portals. The design company then met
representatives from Intercity and Gatwick Airport, which owns the site, to
decide on a design.
At that point, says Steve Hughes, associate director at PSD, one of the big
advantages of the system came into play. 'It was a hands-on meeting, where
we could pull out different elements of the design. We gots lots of people
round the table and they could 'buy in' to the final design.'
The photographic quality of the computer-generated designs also helped,
Hughes believes. 'Because it looks like a photo, not a drawing, everyone can
understand the image. People look through sketches and they don't really
believe them.'
Brazier, too, was impressed with the photographic quality of the images.
'With drawings you don't get a real feel. With the photographic quality
there is no doubt what you are going to get.'
He also liked the short animation sequence, which manipulated the images to
give the viewer the impression of walking through the portals of the new
entrance. 'To be able to walk through while the design is still on the
drawing board or computer is a wonderful facility. These options will be
very valuable for other schemes.'
These could include the interior design of buildings, station entrances or
even trains. Brazier envisages being able to design a train interior and
then walk through it as a passenger would. The software enables the designer
to change the seating plan or even the colour of the fabric.
At PSD the designers are looking ahead to further uses of the system, in
particular where it can be used to speed up the design process. They are
considering using videoconferencing links so that they can discuss their
designs with international clients.
As for the design of the new facade for the Gatwick Express station, in the
distinctive Intercity claret colour, it has been put on hold while the
airport authorities decide whether to go ahead. If not, says Brazier: 'I'll
go back to PSD and get them to modify the sketches.'

FT  15 MAR 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Uphill struggle all the
way - A disappointing 10 years for UK corporate venturers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Corporate venturing in the UK has failed to match early hopes, according to
a paper* published last week.
Corporate venturing is the process where big business invests in small
business through taking minority equity stakes - usually in emergent,
high-technology companies. It is supposed to provide windows on new tech-
nology, takeover opportunities as research matures and, eventually, big
profits.
Investment may be direct, but is more usually via a fund run by an
experienced venture capital manager used to finding growing businesses worth
backing.
The paper, by Kevin McNally of the Urban Policy Research Unit at Southampton
University, makes depressing reading for anyone who attended a 1984 London
conference organised by Arthur Andersen, the accountancy firm, and Venture
Economics, the collector and publisher of venture capital data.
The conference tried to persuade chairmen, chief executives and finance
directors of leading UK companies that corporate venturing was a good thing.
What has happened since can only be interpreted as 10 years of failure, as
McNally reveals.
Whereas the US venture capital industry received about 20 per cent of funds
from corporate venturers during the 1980s, Britain's peaked at a 6 per cent
share (Pounds 34m) in 1988 and a value of Pounds 62m (4 per cent share) in
1989.
McNally says there is some evidence of pick-up since - Pounds 50m from
corporate sources in 1992 and a 15 per cent share of funds raised last year
 -but pension funds, insurance companies and other financial institutions
continue to dominate the ranks of fund-providers.
The research covered 41 venture capital funds. Although 16 had attracted
corporate venturing contributions, the base is narrow: 12 were run by Advent
International and only one-third of all the corporate venturers were UK
companies; 30 per cent were from the US, 11 per cent Japan, and 7 per cent
Australia.
Of the remaining funds, six had been rebuffed by companies they approached
and many of the others had not bothered on the grounds that there were
easier ways of getting investors.
Many fund managers believe corporate venturers are not worth the trouble.
They are seen as short-termist, with unrealistic expectations of quick,
spectacular returns. They also fail to understand how venture capitalism
works - as a portfolio of investments where the lemons ripen before the
plums.
Corporate venturers may be less common in the UK because of the industry's
focus. Seed capital, start-up or early-stage funding accounted for 31 per
cent of monies disbursed by US funds in 1991, compared with 6 per cent in
the UK.
Also, if management buy-outs and buy-ins are excluded, 84 per cent of US
disbursements were in technology-related projects, against the UK's 30 per
cent. This suggests the UK venture capital industry may not actually be
doing much in the market segment where corporate venturing might appeal more
to big companies.
McNally thinks corporate venturers could fill funding gaps now appearing as
pension funds and insurance companies become more cautious.
His research is useful because it shows how to develop more mutual
self-interest for both sides. Potential corporate venturers need to correct
their long-term vision, but venture capital funds need to find more
technological projects at a fundamental or prototype stage for them to look
at.
One problem, however, remains the same as spelt out by a speaker at the 1984
conference: 'Large companies are usually very uncomfortable with small
businesses. There is often an attitude of 'If it's good why don't we own all
of it: if it's bad, why are we messing about like this?'' It looks uphill
all the way.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Scheme to cut cost of
administration - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Small businesses fed up with the time and money spent on administration may
be interested in an initiative launched yesterday by the British Chambers of
Commerce.
The BCC Invoice Clearing House scheme requires companies to compile a list
of suppliers, with the amounts to pay each one, and send a single cheque
covering the full amount; the scheme then makes payments to all the
individual suppliers.
Two dates per month can be chosen for the payment of regular bills,
including electricity, rates bills and personal credit card accounts. The
BCC claims its scheme will lower bank charges as well as saving time and
other administration costs.

business angels - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The chance to buy tickets for December's annual rugby match between Oxford
and Cambridge at Twickenham is the inducement being offered to business
angels participating in a new survey.
The study*, supervised by Hamish Stevenson of Venture Capital Report,
previously a research fellow at Templeton College, is being carried out by
Oxford University. It aims to capture the views and experiences of
individual private investors who have backed, or want to back, small
unquoted businesses in the UK.
'There is an important debate going on at the moment about what sort of
people business angels are and how much money they are willing to invest,'
Stevenson said yesterday. 'Our results should have important implications
for industry practice and government policy.'

FT  15 MAR 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Computers to keep the
books - Affordable accounting packages are now available for even the
smallest companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Little more than a decade after IBM introduced personal computers to the
office desktop, there has been an explosion in powerful software available
to help companies manage their accounts.
Collapsing hardware prices and increasingly user-friendly software have
given managers in the smallest companies a speed of access to information
unimagined by their predecessors.
Where a few years ago companies might only have known the state of their
cash books at the end of a month, real-time accounting packages, costing
little more than the petty cash allowance, now update ledgers the moment a
transaction is completed.
Yet, according to Paul Walker, managing director of Sage, a UK supplier of
integrated accounts packages, as many as 40 per cent of companies with up to
50 employees are still not computerised.
What are these companies missing? At the simplest level, the choice includes
Sage's Moneywise, Microsoft's Money and Intuit's Quicken. These systems are
basic cash management packages. They replicate manual books, but are really
only suitable for sole traders or individuals with the simplest of needs,
according to Dennis Keeling, independent analyst of accounting, business and
manufacturing systems.
Bigger and more complex companies need full-blown, double-entry bookkeeping
accounting systems that have sales, purchase and nominal ledgers. These
so-called integrated packages include Sage's Sterling products, which cost
from Pounds 100 to Pounds 900 through dealers.
Since the company's launch in the mid-1980s, it has attracted 170,000 users
of this software in the UK; Sage services more than 53,000 support
contracts. Sage is working with Microsoft, the US software house, on a joint
promotion to allow the two companies' products to link and form what Sage
calls 'an integrated office environment' that incorporates spreadsheets,
word processing and accounting packages.
But as ever in the fast-moving computer world, there are pretenders to the
market leaders' throne. 'In Sterling you have a world-class package with
incredible volumes,' says Keeling. 'But the product that has come from
nowhere in 18 months to become a significant number two is Megatech's Tas
Books.'
Sold via mail order and costing Pounds 99, Tas Books has 'taken on Sage and
really eaten into its market in the UK', Keeling says. Sage's Sterling still
dwarfs Megatech. But Megatech nevertheless claims 20 per cent of the
integrated accounting packages, helped by a rare recommendation from the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. Sage has about 60
per cent of this market.
The feature of Tas Books that will excite some business people - and appall
some accountants - is that it allows users to correct their mistakes. And it
comes with a detailed tutorial on double entry bookkeeping.
Just as word processors correct typing errors, so Megatech says its Tas
Books acts as an account processor. Many accountants would say that mistakes
should be reversed by contra entries even if this leads to clutter and a
more expensive audit.
'With the account processor you can make changes so the Books represents
your source document 100 per cent accurately,' says Theo van Dort, founder
and chief software designer at Megatech.
'We say forget what accountants will like, this is what businessmen will
like. We want to record the original documents and not mistakes.' To protect
against unauthorised entries, the system keeps an audit trail.
While Megatech claims some very big customers, Keeling says the system is
probably limited to companies with sales of Pounds 5m. Van Dort disagrees,
giving an example of one content Tas Books user, Massarella Catering Group,
a retail caterer in department stores which has sales of Pounds 28m through
98 outlets.
Some critics also say Tas Books has a limited appeal because it is available
only within a Dos operating system, and not within Windows.
Sage, for example, which has 500,000 users in the US, says half its UK sales
of accounting packages are in the Windows format. 'Some people do not want
it (accounting packages) in Windows at the moment,' says Walker. 'But in
America if you don't have a Windows product you might as well go to sleep.'
Encouraged by its success in the market, Megatech says it is now launching a
Tas Books 2 version. In addition to the existing features, this software
will allow users to automate stock control, sales order processing and
purchase order processing.
This product will move Megatech towards a market serving bigger companies
with so-called modular systems. Products in this market include Pegasus
Senior, Sage's Sovereign, Tetra's 2000 and Cameleon, Sun Systems' Sun
Accounts and Multisoft's Prestige. Each module - the cash book, the sales
ledger, the purchase ledger - can cost up to Pounds 1,000.
It is a more competitive, higher end of the market where there is less
growth, partly because most companies buying such packages will already have
some form of computerised bookkeeping.
The real growth is below this level, according to Walker. 'The new small- to
medium-sized company market is still expanding. There is the company that
has still not computerised and those people that computerised four to eight
years ago and who have decided to catch up with technology and are buying
new software.'

FT  15 MAR 94 / Ministers yield on technology curriculum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has admitted that the national curriculum in technology is
unworkable and will allow schools to drop it two years earlier than planned.
Technology - which includes craft subjects such as woodwork and metalwork -
will remain a compulsory subject, but from September schools will be allowed
far more discretion over how it is taught, and which skills should be
covered.
The move is an admission that the current syllabus for technology, one of
the curriculum's four 'core subjects' and one of the government's
educational priorities, has failed to improve standards. Employers,
academics and teachers have attacked the arrangements as unworkable.
The syllabus forces children to cover a wide range of disciplines, and
therefore makes it impossible to specialise in individual skills.
Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the Schools Curriculum and Assessment
Authority, who has been charged with revising the entire national
curriculum, will announce new proposals for technology next month. These are
likely to strip out most of the compulsory requirements while maintaining a
requirement for pupils to study woodwork or metalwork.
The new approach cannot be implemented in all schools until September 1996,
but schools will now be allowed to apply to introduce a modified version of
this curriculum in September this year.
The National Institute for Economic and Social Research last year said the
technology syllabus led to 'great difficulties in teaching' and left less
academic children 'disadvantaged and demotivated'. It suggested that
higher-quality work could be encouraged by allowing children to specialise.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Auditors' right to report fraud is made a duty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Auditors may be barred from auditing financial-services companies if they
detect fraud and fail to report it to regulators. Guidelines issued
yesterday by the Auditing Practices Board convert into a duty the existing
right of auditors to report fraud.
The board, which is responsible for issuing advice to auditors, was asked to
develop the guidelines in response to a recommendation in the 1992 report by
Lord Justice Bingham into the regulatory implications of the closure of Bank
of Credit and Commerce International.
Under existing regulations, auditors are permitted to breach client
confidentiality by reporting fraud in the existing regulated sectors: banks,
building societies and companies involved in financial services.
Under the new version, this right becomes an obligation and is extended for
the first time to friendly societies and insurance companies. Auditors must
still preserve confidentiality and will not be able to inform other clients
that might be affected that they have detected fraud. However, they will
have to ensure that the partner auditing a regulated entity is aware of
other non-audit work undertaken by his or her firm for the same client.
Mr Richard Fleck, a partner with Herbert Smith, the law firm, and a member
of the board, said the guidelines would inevitably lead to an increase in
the number of incidents reported to regulators.
But they were an attempt to highlight issues on which auditors should report
and not every trivial concern.
For example, the guidance for the investment businesses stresses that
incidents to be reported should be of 'material' significance.
The guidelines for reporting to the Bank of England essentially follow the
Bank's own authorisation criteria for deposit-taking institutions, such as
the requirement for directors to be 'fit and proper'.
Separate guidelines for insurance companies and friendly societies are to be
published soon.

dealt yesterday by the House of Lords to its policy of higher-education
reforms.
The Lords approved by a two-vote margin an amendment to the education bill
to ensure that schools act in partnership with universities when training
postgraduate teachers.
Peers also carried a linked amendment stipulating that schools involved in
the initial training of teachers must be accredited by an appropriate
higher-education body.
Universities had already forced the government to withdraw another part of
the bill restricting student unions to a narrow list of core activities.
Opposition spokesmen said the entire bill should now be withdrawn.
Viscount Eccles, a former education minister, and Lord Beloff, an academic,
were among Conservative backbenchers who joined Labour and Liberal Democrat
peers in supporting the partnership amendment, which was carried by 123
votes to 121. Assurances by Baroness Blatch, education minister, that only
schools judged suitable would be allowed to provide school-centred courses
for postgraduates failed to satisfy the critics. She claimed there was no
real difference between the government and opposition peers over the need to
provide for high standards and high-quality teaching.
Lord Judd, Labour spokesman on education in the Lords, who moved the
amendment, suggested that the qualifications of those who enrolled on
school-centred courses would be of limited value.
He feared the emergence of 'tinpot' certificates associated with one local
school.
Lord Eccles warned that if schools providing such courses did not have a
real working partnership with universities, the status of teachers would not
be improved.
'So long as teachers are considered beneath other professions, we are not
going to get our education right,' he said.
Lord Judd hailed the incorporation of the schools-universities partnership
amendment in the bill as 'a wonderful result for a civilised approach to
education', while Lord Russell, a Liberal Democrat peer, described it as 'a
substantial damage-limitation exercise'.
Labour claimed that the amendment would have a serious impact on ministers'
plans to allow schools to run teacher training courses on their own. Shadow
education secretary Mrs Ann Taylor said it 'tears out the heart of the
bill'.
She added: 'After the embarrassing climbdown over student union reforms,
there is nothing left to argue about. John Patten (education secretary)
should withdraw this divisive and unnecessary bill immediately.'
Mr Don Foster, Liberal Democrat education spokesman, said: 'Given widespread
opposition to the government's proposals on teacher training, now is the
time for them to admit defeat and withdraw the entire bill.'
Professor Peter Mortimore, director of London University's Institute of
Education, commented: 'To cut higher education out of the equation is wrong
and denies the students the chance to gain the skills not only to do the job
but to improve and reflect on it and also to see what life is like outside
that school.'

FT  15 MAR 94 / MP warns of pension shortfall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Savings from equalising the state pension age at 65 should be used to meet
the costs of long-term care, Mr Frank Field, the Labour MP who chairs the
cross-party Commons social security committee, said yesterday.
But he warned that even diverting most of this amount would not cover the
whole cost of nursing-home care in the longer term. He hinted that a move to
an even higher retirement age might be necessary.
'Raising the retirement pension age to 67 in 40 years' time to help meet
additional costs which will then have to be met doesn't look like a policy
which can be ruled out of court without the most careful consideration,' he
told a seminar on long-term care organised by Prudential, the UK's largest
life insurer.
He said the equalisation savings - expected to amount to about Pounds 4bn in
the years to 2025 - could be reallocated within the social security budget
to provide a long-term care pension, a more generous level of invalid care
allowance and more comprehensive respite care.
The new pension would be directed at people needing residential or home
long-term nursing care, and would become available on the basis of a
doctor's recommendation.
The seminar also heard estimates of the future cost of long-term care drawn
from work by the Institute of Actuaries. This suggested that in 1991 the
cost of care financed privately was Pounds 3.5bn, that funded by the state
Pounds 6.5bn, and that provided informally by family and friends Pounds
30bn.
The total cost in 2031, however, was estimated to be at least Pounds 60bn,
and possibly Pounds 100bn. The scope for more care to be provided informally
was limited, leaving a steep rise in the care to be financed by public and
private means.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Schools back privatised inspectors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most schools are happy with the new inspection system for England introduced
last September, says a report from consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
The Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted) has contracted out the work
to new inspection companies to ensure that every school is inspected at
least every four years. In a survey of the first 100 schools inspected, 90
per cent reported that the inspections were well managed.
Two-thirds of the schools said the contract for inspection allowed adequate
coverage of their school's range of work.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand also said new 'lay' inspectors, whose presence was at
first strongly opposed by teachers, had 'played a useful role' and were
'well received in schools'.
Ofsted was also told, however, to reduce demands on schools for producing
information before inspections.
Professor Stewart Sutherland, chief inspector of schools, accepted the
report and announced that the number of inspection days for each primary
school would be reduced when their new four-yearly inspections started in
September.
The National Union of Teachers complained that schools' resources had been
excluded from the inspectors' remit. Mr Doug McAvoy, NUT general secretary,
said: 'That exclusion, which also covers class sizes, is a political
decision to enable the government to avoid the blame for shortfalls which
must lie at its door.'

FT  15 MAR 94 / EU 'rescue' from effects of de-regulation predicted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 'cavalry' of the European Union will 'eventually arrive to rescue the UK
from the worst effects of a de-regulated economy,' Mr John Edmonds, the GMB
union's general secretary, will tell a US presidential commission today.
In evidence to the commission in Washington on management and labour
relations, Mr Edmonds will say Britain's industrial-relations system is
likely to be 'stuck in limbo' for the time being.
But, he continues in written evidence, EU social directives imposed on
Britain will rescue the country from the worst excesses of Labour market
de-regulation within the next five years.
Mr Edmonds is taking comfort from a number of important European legal
rulings in recent weeks on part-time work, the transfer of ownership of an
enterprise and collective redundancies, which have strengthened the position
of trade unions.
The GMB leader will tell the commission that Britain cannot escape from the
introduction of works councils - consultative and information forums in
large companies - inside the EU.
Multinationals are unlikely to establish them everywhere but in the UK, he
said. British employers will also be greatly inconvenienced by EU directives
which seek to improve the conditions of part-time workers and other
vulnerable groups. Mr Edmonds will tell the commission that 'whenever a new
directive is signed by the other 11 European countries and British workers
do not benefit, everybody's trade union will slap in a claim for similar
treatment.
'In multinational companies the claims write themselves. How can you deny to
your British employees benefits which your other employees throughout Europe
have by legal right?'

FT  15 MAR 94 / Exchange proposes stake in Crest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Stock Exchange has proposed to its members that it should represent
their interests by taking a shareholding of up to 30 per cent on their
behalf in the new Crest paperless settlements system being developed by the
Bank of England.
The exchange has also proposed that it should interpret the needs of Crest
members to its technical managers.
Since the collapse of the Stock Exchange's proposed Taurus paperless
settlements system last March, the exchange has been seeking a role for
itself in the successor system being built by the Bank of England.
Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, Stock Exchange chairman, said in a letter to exchange
member firms late last week that ownership 'on the basis of a significant
minority interest would best contribute to the effectiveness of the
arrangements'.
Last month the Bank issued a consultation document on Crest ownership saying
that it did not believe any single company should own more than 10 per cent
of it and that no sectoral group should own more than 30 per cent. The
exchange is not interested in owning a stake as small as 10 per cent, it
said yesterday.
However, under these proposals ownership of a 30 per cent stake would
require Stock Exchange member firms to forgo their right to be individual
shareholders.
Sir Andrew said there will be a need for a management role to handle the
transition to Crest from the ageing, paper-based Talisman settlements system
currently in use and operated by the exchange, and 'to interpret the future
requirements of the owners and users to the operator and in managing market
changes'.
Sir Andrew said that at least in the early years of Crest operation the
exchange was the best body to do this.
But the Bank has made clear that it does not want any single company or
interest group to have a controlling role in Crest. In a paper issued last
month, the Bank said it wants a wide ownership base to avoid giving undue
advantage to any one commercial interest or to any one community.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Wary combatants seek end to phoney peace: The search for a
route to talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Britsh and Irish prime ministers, Sinn Fein and the Provisional IRA are
all agreed. The best chance for a lasting peace in Northern Ireland lies in
talks between war-weary combatants in a never-ending conflict. But there
ends the meeting of minds.
The IRA and Sinn Fein know full well that there is mounting popular pressure
for peace and want to be seen wanting to talk. The British and Irish
governments, in spite of the almost daily mantra declaring the peace process
waits for no one, would also prefer to talk. The two sides, to the
embarrassment of the British government, have already done so.
But how to get there again without one or the other losing face is the
dilemma now confronting both. Unless there is a way through, the conflict
could be set for another long, bloody phase.
London and Dublin stand apparently indivisible in their determination not to
talk to terrorists until the violence ends. Dublin, always more ready than
London to offer explanation of the joint Downing Street declaration,
believes there is no more room for further clarification and is increasingly
contemptuous of the republican position.
Sunday's equivocal, late-night statement from the IRA - issued from Dublin
and signed by the apparently flexible if fictitious 'P. O'Neill' of the
Irish Republican Publicity Bureau - avoids an explicit rejection of
December's Downing Street declaration. But it leaves the chances of lasting
peace as elusive as ever.
The triple onslaught at Heathrow airport - arguably attracting more column
inches and political outrage at Westminster than would a dozen murders in
Ulster - taken together with the IRA's first formal response to the
declaration, seem to provide a clearer picture of the next, presumably
agreed, phase in republican strategy.
The mortars at Heathrow - irrespective of whether they were doctored to
minimise injuries - were not to be a final flexing of military muscle before
a ceasefire. The attacks can be seen as part of the pattern of
'spectaculars' predicted by Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president. They are
likely to continue.
The IRA and Sinn Fein clearly believe the British government can eventually
be made to give further ground. The prime objective of republicans now is to
return to the position nearly a year ago when, after lengthy, secret
contacts between the two sides, they believed the British government was
preparing for detailed peace talks.
But if peace is on its mind, the republican movement appears convinced that
 -having made considerable progress while violence continues - it can expect
the two governments to give further ground under duress.
The IRA's Dublin statement, greeted variously as a sign of hope or of
contemptible cynicism, blames the 'negative attitude' of the British
government for lack of progress.
The mortars have triggered renewed calls for the government to do something
to re-energise the London-Dublin initiative, while underlining how limited
are ministers' options for mounting an instant military or political
response.
London's desire for rapid progress on political talks has been stymied both
by the tendency of the constitutional parties to retreat to entrenched
positions in readiness for June's European elections and by Dublin's
reluctance to show its hand over relations between north and south.
On security, any dramatic response by London - such as internment - is ruled
out. Besides handing the IRA a propaganda victory, it would give the lie to
past assertions that co-operation between London and Dublin on such matters
is already extremely good.
Downing Street yesterday signalled some fresh efforts in this area by
revealing that new discussions with Dublin aimed at making co-operation
'even more effective' would urgently take place at official level.
The government yesterday restated its position that there would be no
negotiations before the IRA ended its armed campaign. But whatever it says
in public, further secret contacts with republican leaders can never be
ruled out.
When last year's sequence of secret messages between London and the
republican movement was exposed in November, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern
Ireland secretary, insisted that these had not amounted to negotiation, a
formula which could be repeated.
But whatever the next step, it can now be seen that the Downing Street
declaration - irrespective of its longer-term value - has failed to make an
early breakthrough in the search for peace. The prize remains great but the
fight seems nowhere near over.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Sacked dockers battle for shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Former Medway Ports dockers - who recently won an industrial tribunal ruling
that they were unfairly dismissed - are taking legal advice on whether they
can apply for restitution of shares in the company. They were obliged to
sell the shares when they lost their jobs.
They hope to use Section 459 of the 1985 Companies Act - which relates to
unfair treatment of minority shareholders - to apply for rectification of
the shareholders' register.
About 270 dockers were dismissed in November 1992 because they refused to
accept new conditions of work. The company's articles obliged them to sell
back shares - either given to them or purchased at Pounds 1 each at
privatisation in March 1992 - to the company at Pounds 2.50, a price set by
accountants KPMG Peat Marwick. The company was bought by Mersey Docks and
Harbour Company last September for Pounds 103m, valuing each share at Pounds
37.25.
The sacked dockers won a ruling for unfair dismissal in March, and are to
receive Pounds 10,000 compensation each. Many held shares they sold at the
low price. They are also seeking legal advice over whether to pursue a claim
that KPMG was negligent in valuing the shares at Pounds 2.50.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Police say mortars meant to cause harm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scotland Yard said yesterday that it was 'quite inconceivable' that the IRA
carried out attacks on Heathrow without the intention to 'kill or maim'.
'The devices were loaded with high explosives and contained detonators; they
were carefully constructed,' a Yard spokesman said.
But, in the absence of official clarification on whether the detonators were
primed to explode, some anti-terrorist experts believe mechanical 'failure'
of IRA mortars used at Heathrow was a deliberate ploy to generate maximum
publicity while minimising casualties.
Major John Wyatt, a bomb disposal expert with long experience of IRA
operations, believes the most likely explanation is that the mortars were
'fixed' not to detonate, but did not rule out the possibility that equipment
was drawn from old stock and was faulty.
'Technically it is very easy to ensure that the mortars do not detonate on
impact,' he said. 'Politically I think they (IRA) knew they didn't need to
explode to cause widespread disruption, and illustrate their ability to
carry out random attacks without getting caught,' he said yesterday.
Professor Paul Wilkinson of St Andrews University, another specialist in
counter terrorism, said it was inconceivable that the IRA would have risked
large-scale casualties among US tourists by hitting an aircraft or terminal.
He also discounted suggestions that attacks on Heathrow had involved double
agents supplying the IRA with defective military equipment.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Downing Street warns Sinn Fein on violence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Downing Street yesterday gave its firmest assurance yet that there would be
no negotiations with Sinn Fein until after the IRA has called a permanent
halt to its 25-year campaign of violence.
As London and Dublin struggled to stop their peace initiative being blown
off track by last week's mortar attacks at London's Heathrow airport,
officials promised new talks on security co-operation between the two
governments as a matter of urgency.
Downing Street - responding to fresh IRA demands for direct talks between
London and republican leaders - said it was a 'fundamental principle' of
December's joint declaration that there would be no negotiations with Sinn
Fein in advance of an end to IRA violence.
That principle was not going to change. It was 'deeply offensive' to people
in Britain and Ireland that the IRA should claim to be interested in peace
while continuing to kill people in cold blood and to prosecute its campaign
of terror.
However, Downing Street's choice of words appeared to leave the door open
for a possible resumption of messages between London and republican leaders.
When last year's secret contacts were exposed in November, Sir Patrick
Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said the messages had not amounted to
negotiating with terrorists.
The president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, yesterday
continued his efforts to wrong-foot the government, saying that Sinn Fein
had 'no great concern' to be engaged in bilateral discussions with London on
constitutional matters.
Repeating his call for clarification, Mr Gerry Adams welcomed the first
official IRA response to the Downing Street declaration on Sunday,
describing it as a 'positive reiteration' of the IRA's commitment to
reaching a negotiated peace deal.
Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour
party, said that London should launch new talks with Sinn Fein.
He insisted that the IRA did not intend to detonate any of the mortar bombs
which were fired into Heathrow in three separate attacks.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said the attacks on Heathrow
were 'a gross miscalculation by the IRA' which was not going to advance the
peace process.
Mr John Major is expected to be pressed to tighten security in meetings with
the leaders of the two main unionist parties this week.
The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hard-line Democratic Unionists, said
yesterday that the prime minister had not got 'the guts or spine or ability'
to stand up to Dublin.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Gatwick airport adds 13 scheduled flights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gatwick airport's efforts to expand scheduled air services were yesterday
given a strong boost with the announcement of 13 additional scheduled
flights this spring and summer.
BAA, the airports operator, has sought to develop Gatwick's role as London's
second-biggest international schedule airport after Heathrow and transform
its image as a charter holiday airport.
The new services include the launch by American Airlines of flights to
Nashville, Tennessee, and Raleigh/Durham, North Carolina, in May bringing to
19 the US destinations served from Gatwick.
Emirates, the Dubai-based carrier, is returning to Gatwick with a new
service to Abu Dhabi. Emirates, like many other Gatwick-based international
carriers, had moved to Heathrow following the government's decision three
years ago to scrap London's air traffic distribution rules. Other new routes
include Gatwick's first scheduled link with Johannesburg to be operated by
Flitestar this summer.
Southeast European is returning to Gatwick at the end of this month with
services to Athens, while British Airways, which has significantly expanded
its presence at the airport following its takeover of Dan-Air, is launching
services to Stavanger in Norway, resuming services to Nice and increasing
service frequencies to Tel Aviv and to Malaga.
The new services will bring the total of scheduled airlines operating from
Gatwick to 50 flying to more than 120 destinations. Provision for the
domestic market is also set to expand with new services to Birmingham,
Bristol and Cardiff by Community Express from next month.
BAA said yesterday traffic at its seven airports had continued to show
strong growth last month. The seven airports handled 5.3m passengers last
month, an increase of 5.9 per cent on February 1993. Passenger numbers at
Stansted were 27 per cent higher while passenger traffic grew by 0.4 per
cent at Gatwick.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Loophole in Irish Republic's extradition law to be closed by
end of next month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A loophole in the Irish Republic's extradition law, under which an IRA
suspect was released from custody in Dublin yesterday, is expected to be
closed by the end of next month, Tim Coone writes.
Mr Anthony Gorman (above), wanted in Britain in connection with the 1992
killing of an army sergeant outside a recruiting office in Derby, was
released by a district court after the Irish state offered no evidence
against him.
New legislation in the republic will prevent IRA suspects blocking
extradition to Britain on serious criminal charges on the grounds that their
crimes are 'political'. The bill completed its Dail (parliament) stages with
little opposition, and is due to go to the Senate next week. Defence lawyers
for IRA suspects can argue now that possession and/or use of a non-automatic
firearm is a political offence, and non-extraditable under the Irish
constitution.
The Irish Department of Justice says the bill will be brought into force
once 'speciality' arrangements are in place between Ireland and the UK to
prevent a suspect being charged with a different offence to that upon which
he or she has been extradited.
Both governments are finalising arrangements which are expected to be ready
in time to coincide with the passing of the new extradition bill.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Tighter rules on Lecs called for
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Local enterprise companies (Lecs), the employer-led economic development
bodies, should be obliged to publish details of all grants they give to
businesses, Mr Campbell Christie, general secretary of the Scottish Trades
Union Congress, said yesterday.
Mr Christie said the recently introduced arrangement - whereby Lecs are
obliged to publish details of grants to companies in which a Lec director
has an interest - meant there was not the 'total openness' there ought to
be.
It also placed Lec directors whose companies were receiving Lec grants at a
disadvantage with their competitors. They had to disclose details of their
company's transactions with the Lec, but rival companies receiving grants
did not.
Mr Christie, who is on the board of the Glasgow Development Agency, one of
the Lecs, was giving evidence in Glasgow to the inquiry by the Scottish
select committee into Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands
Enterprise, the parent bodies for the Lecs.
He said he believed in the local delivery of economic development, but was
concerned that too much power had been transferred by Scottish Enterprise to
the Lecs, creating tension between it and them.
For example, he said, Scottish Enterprise had given the Lecs responsibility
for helping defence companies diversify, instead of taking a strategic view.
An initiative to help the electronics industry was in the hands of the
Scottish Electronics Forum, which he called 'a self-help group' of companies
with little input from Scottish Enterprise or the Scottish Office Industry
Department.
Mr Christie also complained that there was no union representative on the
Scottish Enterprise board.
A public and private-sector partnership launched yesterday to promote
Somerset has set itself the target of helping to create 25,000 jobs by the
year 2000.
The Somerset Economic Partnership brings together the county and district
councils, chambers of commerce and industry and Training and Enterprise
Councils. It is the latest of a series of initiatives in the west country
designed to develop economic strategy and to lobby on issues such as
regional aid.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Straw fights back over council tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday stepped up its campaign for May's local elections by
claiming that three of the five highest council taxes in the country were
levied by Conservative authorities.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, accused the government of using
selective and inapplicable data to back its claim that Labour councils would
charge higher levels of council tax than the Conservatives next year.
Tackling what could be the most critical issue in the forthcoming local
elections, Mr Straw said the government had no basis for claiming that
Labour councils would charge an average of Pounds 129 more council tax than
Tory-controlled authorities.
The government arrived at this figure using the average rate of council tax
to be levied on properties in band C - valued between Pounds 52,000 and
Pounds 68,000.
Mr Straw argued that the calculation was deceptive because band C rates were
typically lower in Conservative areas where there was a preponderance of
homes in the higher-valuation bands, ranging from E to H.
'The Tories produced those council tax band C figures in a lame attempt to
prove that Tory councils were cheaper,' said Mr Straw. 'They convinced no
one, not even themselves.'
Using a different method of calculation - average council tax payments per
household - Mr Straw argued that Labour councils would charge Pounds 40 less
than the Conservatives next year, and Pounds 26 less than the Liberal
Democrats.
On this basis, a Local Government Chronicle survey of council taxes levied
in 205 shire districts found that Labour authorities charged an average of
Pounds 466.65 compared with Pounds 502.91 for Conservative councils and
Pounds 503.31 for the Liberal Democrats.
However, the same survey also suggests that several of the lowest-charging
authorities will be Tory-controlled. These include Wandsworth (Pounds
136.15), Wellingborough (Pounds 225.79), Westminster (Pounds 267.83) and
Rochester (Pounds 364.45).
Low-charging Labour authorities include Great Yarmouth (Pounds 375.50) and
Southampton (Pounds 395.82), the survey says.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Sacked Medway dockers hope to regain shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Former Medway Ports dockers - who recently won an industrial tribunal ruling
that they were unfairly dismissed - are taking legal advice on whether they
can apply for restitution of shares in the company. They were obliged to
sell the shares when they lost their jobs.
They hope to use Section 459 of the 1985 Companies Act - which relates to
unfair treatment of minority shareholders - to apply for rectification of
the shareholders' register.
About 270 dockers were dismissed in November 1992 because they refused to
accept new conditions of work. The company's articles obliged them to sell
back shares - either given to them or purchased at Pounds 1 each at
privatisation in March 1992 - to the company at Pounds 2.50, a price set by
accountants KPMG Peat Marwick.
The company was bought by Mersey Docks and Harbour Company last September
for Pounds 103m, valuing each share at Pounds 37.25. The sacked dockers won
a ruling for unfair dismissal in March, and are to receive Pounds 10,000
compensation each. Many held shares they sold at the low price and are
seeking advice over whether they can regain the shares.
Dockers are also seeking legal advice over whether to pursue a claim that
KPMG was negligent in valuing the shares at Pounds 2.50.
It has been confirmed that Mr Peter Vincent, the chief executive of Medway
Ports who has taken up a position on the board of Mersey Docks and Harbour
Company, bought more than 100,000 ordinary shares from former directors
three months before the takeover by Mersey Docks.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Water companies told to cut costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Water companies must cut costs over the next five years, Mr Ian Byatt,
director-general of Ofwat, the water industry regulator, said yesterday,
Bronwen Maddox, Environment Correspondent, writes.
Customers should not have to pay higher charges except to fund improvements
that are 'absolutely necessary', he told the Financial Times conference in
London on the European Water Industry.
Mr Byatt will notify water companies this spring of the annual price
increases which he proposes to let them charge from 1995 to 2005. However,
he said the increases proposed by the companies in business plans submitted
to him - which on average allow for an increase well above the rate of
inflation - would be unacceptable to customers.
'I will expect companies to deliver existing services more cheaply in the
future,' he said. 'I will look particularly hard at areas where prices are
high - either by comparison with other companies or with the past.'
Politicians of all parties and consumer groups have been increasingly
concerned that water bills have outstripped inflation, particularly since
the industry's privatisation in 1989.
The water industry argues that the rise is needed to pay for long-overdue
modernisation to the infrastructure of drains and treatment plants, and to
bring water quality up to the standards specified in European Union
directives.
This year, the European Commission will start to review drinking water
standards. The UK and some other EU countries have argued that some of the
rules are unnecessary for health, and that they need to be better matched to
scientific evidence about medical effects.
Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, the EU environment commissioner, has told the UK
that it will not be given more time to comply with standards despite concern
about the impact on bills.

FT  15 MAR 94 / City landlords rebuild for the future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An improvement in prospects for the City of London office market is
prompting some landlords to consider upgrading buildings that were damaged
by an IRA bomb attack last April.
Hammerson, the property company, intends to spend Pounds 65m on rebuilding
99 Bishopsgate, a 290,000 sq ft building which it bought for Pounds 25m from
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation last week. Part of the sum will be
recovered from the building's insurers.
'We anticipate that, with the continuing take-up of new space in the City
and the low level of new development, there will be a shortage of quality
space in 1996 when works are completed,' said Mr Ron Spinney, chief
executive.
The total cost of bomb damage is estimated to be Pounds 600m, according to
the Association of British Insurers. The final sum is still unknown because
many owners are still negotiating with insurers and tenants of bomb-damaged
buildings.
Plans for 1.2m sq ft of buildings that were severely damaged have not yet
been finalised, according to the Corporation of London, the local authority
for the city. Work is under way or completed on a further 1.7m sq ft of
damaged property.
The slack state of the office market has allowed landlords to delay
finalising their plans. 'If the office market had been buoyant there would
have been much more pressure to get buildings back on line quickly,' says Mr
Peter Gilder, district surveyor at the corporation.
Plans are still being drawn up for the refurbishment of the NatWest Tower,
the largest building damaged by the bomb. In December National Westminster
Bank appointed design and engineering specialists to consider its options,
which could involve a complete re-cladding of the building. Work is likely
to begin in the late summer.
Last year's bomb stimulated the take-up of 600,000 sq ft of office space and
the withdrawal from the market of 500,000 sq ft of damaged offices,
according to Savills, surveyors. Together with an upturn in demand from
occupiers, this cut the amount of empty office space in the City by nearly a
fifth last year.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Housing market 'growing rapidly'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The housing market enjoyed substantial growth last month, says a survey of
more than 100 estate agents published today.
The increase bodes well for a rise in house sales during the peak spring
buying season according to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors,
which conducted the survey.
Its findings were not uniform, and some agents said interest from
prospective buyers slackened during the latter part of last month. This may
have been due to severe weather keeping people indoors or to buyers becoming
discouraged by the prospect of tax increases due next month.
More than 85 per cent of agents questioned in England and Wales by the
institution said purchases, visits and reservations by prospective buyers
rose during the three months to the end of February compared with the
previous three months.
Only 13 per cent said activity had remained constant or had fallen. Fourteen
per cent of agents said prices had risen during the period compared with 6.4
per cent who said they had fallen. The rest said prices were unchanged.
The institution said the housing market traditionally recovers after the New
Year with sales expected to reach a peak during spring before subsiding as
the school summer holidays approach. The signs were that sales this spring
may be the best for several years, it added.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Demise of miners' gala is postponed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Durham Miners' Gala, under threat because of the demise of the Durham
coalfield, is to be held this year following a strong response to an appeal
for financial support.
Much to the surprise of the National Union of Mineworkers, companies are
among those expressing interest in supporting the event, which in recent
years has been a platform for leftwingers.
While negotiations are in progress the NUM is not disclosing the names of
potential backers of the biggest and most evocative annual working class
rally in Britain.
But Mr Dave Hopper, general secretary of the north-east NUM and of the
Durham Miners Association, which stages the event, said yesterday the volume
of offers meant the 110th gala - which is to cost Pounds 20,000 to mount -
would definitely go ahead on July 9.
The gala's subsequent future remains unclear: the NUM and DMA have been
concerned to ensure that its leftwing radicalism is not diluted.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Further spending rise is expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recovery in consumer spending is set to continue despite further
declines in consumer confidence ahead of next month's tax rises, says a
survey published today.
In its latest quarterly survey, PA Cambridge Economic Consultants reports
that consumer confidence is at its lowest level since March 1991, when the
survey began. A record number of households expects their finances to
deteriorate because of modest wages growth and next month's tax rises.
Despite this, planned spending on everyday items such as food and clothing
remains strong and is at its highest March level to date. The evidence for
durable goods is more mixed, although furniture and car purchase intentions
remain buoyant.
Mr Nick Mansley, senior consultant at PACEC, said: 'Evidence suggests that
people will want to carry on spending despite the tax rises being a major
concern, and most of this growth in consumption will come from a falling
savings ratio.'
The survey reports that house purchase intentions have increased slightly
but are still subdued.
Confidence in the government is at a record low. Of the 1000 respondents, 52
per cent said they had little or no confidence 'in the government's ability
to solve the pressing problems facing the country'.
The survey was conducted between February 26 and March 6.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Output price figures boost rate cut hope
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes of further cuts in base rates were revived yesterday by figures
showing that inflationary pressures in the UK remain subdued.
Output, or factory gate, prices of home sales of manufactured products rose
by 3.3 per cent in the 12 months to February compared with an increase of
3.7 per cent in the year to January.
Producer price statistics are generally seen as a good indicator of the
future path of retail price inflation, and yesterday's figures were better
than expected. The Central Statistical Office said output prices rose by an
unadjusted 0.1 per cent between January and February compared with a
consensus forecast of 0.3 per cent.
If the volatile elements of food, drink, tobacco and petroleum are excluded,
output prices also rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.1 per cent between
January and February.
The annual growth in this measure - seen as an indicator of 'core' inflation
 -was only 2.4 per cent, down from 2.6 per cent in January. Furthermore, the
core rate appears to be falling.
On an annualised basis, prices over the three months to February were only
1.2 per cent higher than in the previous three months.
Mr Adrian Cooper, UK economist at James Capel, said the figures indicated
that 'disinflation is very broadly spread across the manufacturing sector as
a whole'.
He added that the figures represented a 'necessary, but not sufficient
condition' for a further interest rate cut, which was likely to be triggered
by signs that next month's tax increases were slowing the recovery.
The news helped sentiment on the stock market, which was also cheered by
news of continuing declines in manufacturers' costs. Input prices - the
prices of fuel and raw materials bought by manufacturing industry - rose 0.3
per cent, on a seasonally adjusted basis, between January and February.
Over the 12 months to February, input prices fell 3.6 per cent, compared
with a 3.3 per cent drop in the year to January; a fall in oil prices has
been the main cause of the decline.

FT  15 MAR 94 / ITC to investigate World In Action 'bias'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Independent Television Commission has begun looking at a formal
allegation by the Conservative party that Granada Television has breached
its broadcasting licence because of a World In Action programme.
Sir Norman Fowler, party chairman, has submitted the formal complaint to the
commission over the current affairs programme that looked at the effect of
the government's taxation plans on three families in the marginal Tory
constituency of Dover.
In his letter to the commission, Sir Norman complains that the programme did
not show 'due impartiality'.
Investigation of the complaint could be the first proper test of
controversial impartiality rules imposed by the 1990 Broadcasting Act on
commercial television.
The act required the commission to draw up an impartiality code to take
'particular account of the impartiality due to major matters of political or
industrial controversy or relating to current public policy'.
There was considerable opposition at the time to the idea that the contents
of an impartiality code should be part of an act of parliament. The
commission did, however, accept the concept after original proposals were
watered down.
The code says that licensees must ensure that justice is done to a full
range of significant views and perspectives during the period in which the
controversy is active. The commission makes clear that balance can be
achieved over time and that an impartial programme service does not
necessarily have to ensure that in a single programme all sides have a
chance to speak.
The World In Action programme chose three families in Dover who had all
voted Conservative at the last general election. It asked the Institute for
Fiscal Studies to calculate how much more tax they would have to pay as a
result of Conservative taxation changes since the last general election.
The local MP Mr David Shaw, it is believed, was asked to appear, but
declined.
A long list of Conservative politicians, it was suggested last night, also
declined. They included all the main Treasury ministers from Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to Mr
Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary, and former chancellor Mr Norman
Lamont.
Conservative Central Office was also asked to nominate a spokesman, it is
believed.
In the end the programme contained a contribution from Mr Shaun Woodward,
one of the leading figures who ran the Conservative's election campaign.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Suzuki acts to end its 20-year link with Heron
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Suzuki, the Japanese car, motorcycle and power products group, is taking
control of the highly profitable UK import and distribution activities for
its vehicles. The operations have been owned and operated for the past 20
years by Mr Gerald Ronson's Heron International.
Suzuki, struggling against heavy losses at Santana Motor, its Spanish-based
European manufacturing operations, will take control of UK sales and
distribution on March 31, when its most recent five-year contract with Heron
Suzuki expires.
Heron International is seeking rescheduling of interest payments to
bondholders after the troubled group's Pounds 1.4bn restructuring last
September.
Heron Suzuki, known as Suzuki (GB) until a name change two years ago, made
pre-tax profits of Pounds 7m on turnover of Pounds 106m in its year to March
1992, the most recent year for which accounts have been filed. It was
profitable throughout the steep motor industry recession at the start of the
1990s, when some of the larger carmakers and importers sank into losses.
Last year it sold more than 11,000 cars, leisure four-wheel-drive vehicles
and light commercial vehicles. When motorcycles and power products are
included, the company has a total of 500 dealers in the UK.
Suzuki's clawback comes as no surprise to Mr Ronson or Heron, however.
Renewal contracts are typically signed well over a year before they are due
to expire, and Suzuki Motor Corporation indicated early last year that it
intended to change the relationship with the struggling Heron. A number of
proposed alternatives were looked at, including takeover by a separate
investor group led by Mr Ronson, before Suzuki decided to assume control
itself.
Neither side would say what Suzuki would pay Heron for the takeover, but one
insider maintained: 'It's not a very substantial sum.'
Heron Suzuki's main assets relate to an import-and-distribution centre at
Sheerness and a parts centre and administrative offices at Crawley, West
Sussex. The company employs 165 people.
Mr John Norman, Heron Suzuki's chief executive, said the two sides 'are in
the final stages of the legal discussions and negotiations for an orderly
transfer of the business by March 31'.
The Suzuki takeover is the latest example of a trend by vehicle
manufacturers to assume control of import-and-distribution businesses
previously run by independents. Nissan has taken control from Mr Octav
Botnar's Nissan UK, Volkswagen has taken back its UK franchise from Lonrho,
Volvo from the Lex Service group and Fiat has taken Alfa-Romeo back from
Inchcape's TKM subsidiary.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Last-minute clause caused act's ambiguity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's statement by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry
secretary, resolves the confusion over an ambiguously worded clause inserted
into the 1986 Insolvency Act at the last minute.
In a 1985 case, Nicoll v Cutts, the courts ruled in favour of the receivers
and against a director who had sued them, claiming he was entitled to
compensation because he had not formally been dismissed.
The case was raised during parliamentary discussion on the Insolvency Act,
and a clause was introduced stating that a receiver who did not dismiss
employees at a company would be deemed to have adopted their contracts.
Until then, receivers had simply paid employees during the period for which
they were in charge of a company. Other employment costs - such as pay in
lieu of notice - ranked only as unsecured claims alongside other creditors'.
The 1986 law suggested that they would in any case become liable after 14
days for all outstanding employment obligations, including long-term service
contracts of the directors.
These claims have preference over money owed to unsecured creditors. In
administration, any remaining assets of a company would be paid to meet
these claims. In administrative receivership, the receiver would also be
personally liable for any remaining shortfall.
In 1987 the insolvency profession pushed through a test case - Specialised
Mouldings - which supported the action taken by receivers: that they were
not deemed to have adopted the employees' contracts if they wrote and told
staff that they had not done so. The Court of Appeal judgment on Paramount
two weeks ago appeared to overturn this ruling, arguing that all previous
employment rights should be honoured and ranked as priority claims ahead of
unsecured creditors unless a new contract had been drawn up.
As a result, insolvency practitioners began to lay off staff rather than
risk incurring substantial additional obligations and becoming personally
liable for any shortfall.
Mr Heseltine's statement yesterday ensures that future administrations and
receiverships will reinstate the practices adopted by practitioners until
now, and remove the personal liability of receivers to meet any shortfall.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
THREAT TO THE RESCUE CULTURE
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -What the Insolvency Act 1986 sets out
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  It makes receivers personally liable for any contract of employment
  'adopted' by them. If administrators 'adopt' a contract, employees get
  first call on assets.
  It recognises that administrators and receivers can contract out of
  personal liability by providing that they will not be deemed to have
  'adopted' a contract of employment because of anything they do or omit
  to do within 14 days of their appointment.
  It gives receivers the right to an indemnity against personal
  liability out of the assets of the company.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -How it was interpreted
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Administrators and receivers interpreted the act to mean they had 14
  days after their appointment to dismiss employees or to negotiate new
  employment terms which exclude personal liability. This was endorsed
  by the High Court in February 1987.
  Receivers and administrators now issue letters to all employees within
  14 days of their appointment. These spell out that the company will
  continue to pay salaries buy they do not and will not adopt or assume
  personal liability in respect of contracts of employment.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -The case of Paramount Airways
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  The administrators issued such a letter to all employees but when they
  failed to find a buyer and dismissed all the employees, two pilots
  sued for wages in lieu of notice.
  The administrators argued they had not adopted contracts of employment
  because of the letter sent to employees exluding personal liability.
  The Court of Appeal said that 'where administrators continued
  substantially after 14 days to employ staff and pay them in accordance
  with previous contracts they would be held impliedly to have adopted
  those contracts.'
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -What happens next
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Insolvency practitioners and lawyers say the decision reverses the
  previous position and threatens the 'rescue culture'.
  If receivers could not exclude personal liability they would not risk
  trying to trade out of difficulty. Little alternative but to dismiss
  staff immediately.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Welcome for Paramount legislation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine's statement in the Commons yesterday may have come too
late for the employees of Michael Mayes, the textile manufacturer based in
Rotherham, South Yorkshire.
Although emergency legislation will apply from this morning, Mr Lindsay
Denney, the receiver from accountants Touche Ross, warned late last night
that the company was already being wound down and that there was no buyer in
the wings. He said he had not yet made a final decision, but he expected to
make an announcement to the company's 140 staff by lunchtime today.
However, the insolvency profession in general welcomed the proposed
legislation. Mr Mark Homan, head of insolvency at Price Waterhouse and
president of the Society of Practitioners of Insolvency, said: 'We're very
pleased. This puts the law back to what is was before 1986. This is
excellent news.'
Mr Richard Brown, deputy director-general of the British Chambers of
Commerce, said: 'This is good news for jobs, and for those concerned with
the capacity of UK commerce and industry.
'(It) gives back to administrators the crucial ability to manage companies
back into solvency.'
The amendment came after two weeks' intensive lobbying from the profession.
Mr Denney had met Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and mentioned his case,
while the society held meetings with Whitehall officials and submitted a
report to Mr Neil Hamilton, minister for corporate affairs.
For some, the legislation was already too late. Mr Steve Hill, an insolvency
partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said that since the decision, he had had to
lay off 12 employees at a small building company and six at a maggot farm.
There have been relatively few such cases in the two weeks since the
Paramount ruling in the court of appeal.
Mr Homan said he believed that banks may have held back from calling in
receivers since the judgment in order to wait for clarification.
Mr Heseltine's statement offers no relief to companies already in
receivership or administration, to which the Paramount ruling appears to
apply.
Mr Homan warned that this might lead to a freeze on future payments to
creditors in many companies while potential additional employment costs were
quantified.
The administrators of Paramount are likely to appeal their case to the House
of Lords, while other insolvency professionals are considering seeking legal
advice on their own cases.
However, one leading practitioner said: 'I think the urgency has gone out of
this. Now it is each practitioner for himself.'
Another practitioner warned that while the law would remove the burden of
additional employment obligations from receivers and administrators, these
costs remained in place for purchases of insolvent businesses under the
transfer of undertakings law.

FT  15 MAR 94 / ITN radio franchise bid unlikely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Independent Television News has almost certainly decided not to bid today
for the third UK national commercial radio licence for a predominantly
speech-based service.
ITN, which had been planning a bid with Planet 24 - the independent
production company - is still interested in radio, but has been put off, it
is believed, by two factors. One is the uncertainty over precisely what
format the BBC is planning for its news and sport service on Radio 5, Five
Live. The other is the announcement by the Radio Authority that a fourth
national radio service is now an option.
Fears, particularly of an INR4, are likely to reduce the number of serious
bidders for the INR3 licence to four or five, though it could be developed
as an all-news and talk station.
There is also considerable doubt that either GWR, the Bristol-based radio
group, or London's Capital Radio, whose two licences are soon to be
re-advertised, will put in a bid. There is also growing doubt whether
Classic FM, a rumoured runner, will go forward.
'The phones are still red hot. Everyone is still talking to everyone else,'
said one radio industry executive, who added that some decisions may not be
taken until this morning.
Firm bidders include:
Associated Newspapers together with SelecTV and the Radio Trust, a
consortium of radio interests.
Apollo Radio, a consortium that includes Chiltern Radio, Radio 702 of
Johannesburg and two financial institutions.
A consortium led by Mr John Whitney, former director-general of the
Independent Broadcasting Authority.
LBC, a company that has little choice but to bid. The London commercial
broadcaster goes off the air in October, having lost its licences to London
News Radio.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Gardiner re-elected leader of 92 Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir George Gardiner, the Conservative MP who was rebuffed when he attempted
to advise the prime minister, was re-elected yesterday as chairman of the 92
Group of rightwing MPs.
Sir George, MP for Reigate, suffered a blow to his credibility as a leader
of rightwing opinion when Mr Major ended a consultation meeting after just
two minutes.
Mainstream Conservative MPs saw the brevity of the meeting as evidence of Mr
Major's unwillingness to be dictated to by Sir George, who was pressing for
more rightwing cabinet ministers.
Sir George, a leading Maastricht rebel, also suffered a defeat when he was
removed from the executive of the 1922 Committee of Conservative MPs after a
campaign by government loyalists.
However, rightwing MPs said Sir George had 'comfortably' beaten off a
challenge to his leadership of the 92 Group from Sir Anthony Durant, MP for
Reading West, who is regarded as more committed to Mr Major's leadership.
Sir George said he would call a meeting of the group, which has more than
100 supporters, to sharpen its approach. 'We've always been a loyalist group
and that will continue. Our efforts will continue to be devoted to helping
the government to regain its popularity,' he said.
Mr Major was said to be 'relaxed' about the election result. However,
government whips had hoped that election of Sir Anthony would reduce
friction with the 92 Group.

FT  15 MAR 94 / GM deal resolves fight over Isuzu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Motors' Vauxhall subsidiary and IM (International Motors), the UK's
largest private motor-imports group, have backed away from a legal fight
over who is entitled to import and distribute four-wheel-drive vehicles
produced by Isuzu of Japan, in which GM has a 37 per cent stake.
A compromise has been reached under which both Vauxhall and IM will sell
various versions of the vehicle in dispute, the Isuzu Trooper, until late
1996. By then IM should have available a full range of similar vehicles
built by a rival manufacturer, Ssangyong of South Korea.
Vauxhall dealers will start selling some Trooper models in May, but they
will be re-badged as the Vauxhall Monterey.
Under EU-Japanese market monitoring arrangements, it is expected that 6,700
Trooper/Monterey models will be available for sale in the UK this year, of
which more than half will be sold by Vauxhall dealers under the compromise
with IM.
During 1995, when IM's current Isuzu dealers will have already begun selling
Ssangyong's Mercedes-powered four-wheel-drive alternative, IM's share of
Trooper sales will be halved to around 1,500 units. In the final year, IM's
dealers are likely to be selling only 1,000 Isuzu models, mostly
commercial-vehicle versions.
Mr Bob Edmiston's IM, whose wholly owned Isuzu (UK) subsidiary has held the
Isuzu franchise since 1987, last year declared its intention to seek legal
action to block GM's Isuzu plans after Vauxhall's chairman, Mr Charles
Golden, said Vauxhall would 'take up its right' to import Troopers from
January 1.
IM maintained that GM unlawfully sought to procure the termination of Isuzu
(UK)'s contract to operate the franchise in the UK.
IM originally filed a suit against GM in the US, but a US court ruled that
any proceedings should be heard in the UK.
GM has been selling the vehicle through its continental European dealer
networks, where it is badged as an Opel, since early last year.

Mr Robert Key, roads and traffic minister, said the government would give a

He compared speeding motorists to drunken drivers and told the 59th National

attitudes to drinking and driving. Now we must do the same for speed.'
About Pounds 600,000 would be devoted to the anti-speeding campaign.

Sixty-three employees who lost their jobs when IBM in Portsmouth changed its
contract caterer could receive up to Pounds 500,000 in compensation in a
further important test case for the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of
Employment) regulations.
Southampton industrial tribunal has ruled that the Tupe regulations, which
give workers some protection in business transfers, did apply to the
transfer. Bromwich Catering, which won the contract from Gardner Merchant
argued - along with IBM - that the regulations did not apply. The result
could have implications for forthcoming Tupe catering cases.

<TEXT>
A 37-year-old woman left paralysed after a motorway accident was yesterday
awarded record compensation of Pounds 3.4m.
Ms Christine Leung from Solihull, West Midlands, suffered severe spinal
injuries when the car in which she was a passenger crashed after swerving to
avoid luggage which fell from another vehicle on the M3 in Surrey four years
ago.
The Pounds 3.4m awarded by the High Court at Birmingham was said by her
solicitors to be the biggest ever for a personal injury. It covers
compensation, loss of earnings and the cost of employing two nurses to care
for Ms Leung.
The award was made against the driver of the car from which the luggage
fell.

FT  15 MAR 94 / CBI chief calls for overhaul of lawmaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A call for radical changes in the way parliament drafts and passes
legislation was made last night by Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the
Confederation of British Industry.
Mr Davies, speaking to the European Policy Forum in London, also set out a
detailed case for a big overhaul of the way the government handles tax
legislation.
In a address which echoed the private concerns of many MPs and ministers, he
said legislation should be subject to more thorough consultation, better
drafting and scrutiny, and the introduction of formal review procedures.
His recommendations come against the background of rising concern at
Westminster as well as in the business community about the amount of hastily
drafted and sometimes ill-conceived legislation passed by MPs.
Tory business managers have pointed in recent months to the scores of
amendments the government has been forced to make to its own legislation
during its final stages in the Commons because it has not been properly
drafted at the outset.
Mr Davies said that much more intensive consultation with interested parties
could avoid 'bad law and expensive ambiguities which have to be resolved in
the courts'. Some Whitehall departments consulted effectively and well but,
he added, 'but many do not, or do so in an unsatisfactory or perfunctory
way'.
The government should make space also in the parliamentary timetable for the
practical legislation and tidying up measures frequently recommended by the
Law Commission. These would be of great assistance to the business community
but at the moment were squeezed out by the high-profile bills pressed by
Whitehall departments.
He cited possible amendments to the Sale of Goods Act and legislation on the
Privity of Contract as good examples. The CBI had been consulted on both in
the mid 1980s but the government had yet to act. It had similarly done
nothing since requesting 'urgent' consult-ation last year on competition
law.
The CBI believed that a convention should be developed so that governments
should be able to set aside time in each parliament for the non-contentious
reform of areas of the law.
Turning to legislation to implement the annual Budget, Mr Davies said that
tax law suffered particularly badly from inadequate consultation.
He accepted that policy measures, - designed, for example, to close tax
loopholes - had to remain confidential. But there was still ample scope for
technical advice to be provided from outside parliament once measures were
announced.
One solution would be to have separate finance bills - one detailing the
chancellor's proposed policy changes and the other, with technical changes
to the law. Another improvement would be the publication of a draft bill
before its first reading in parliament.
Mr Davies said a further area of concern to the business community was the
current scrutiny process for European Union legislation in the Commons.
While the House of Lords had established an effective select committee on
European legislation, MPs did not have a comparable body able to consult
with outside interests on draft directives.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Lords deal blow to government's teacher training plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's higher education policy suffered a serious blow yesterday
after the House of Lords approved by a two-vote margin an amendment to the
education bill to ensure that schools act in partnership with universities
when training postgraduate teachers.
Universities lobbied hard for the amendment. They had already forced the
government to withdraw another part of the bill, restricting student unions
to a narrow list of core activities. Opposition spokesmen said the entire
bill should now be withdrawn.
Viscount Eccles, a former education minister and Lord Beloff, an academic,
were among Conservative backbenchers who joined Labour and Liberal Democrat
peers in supporting the amendment, which was carried by 123 votes to 121.
Assurances by Baroness Blatch, education minister, that only schools judged
to be suitable would be allowed to provide school-centred courses for
postgraduates failed to satisfy the critics. She claimed there was no real
difference between the government and opposition peers over the need to
provide for high standards and high-quality teaching.
Lord Judd, Labour spokesman on education in the Lords, who moved the
amendment, suggested that the qualifications of those who enrolled on
school-centred courses would be of limited value.
He feared the emergence of 'tinpot' certificates associated with one local
school.
Lord Eccles warned that if schools providing such courses did not have a
real working partnership with universities, the status of teachers would not
be improved.
'So long as teachers are considered beneath other professions we are not
going to get our education right,' he said.
Lord Beloff said that school-centred courses should only be undertaken by
schools in co-operation with institutions of higher education.
Lord Judd hailed the incorporation of the amendment in the bill as 'a
wonderful result for a civilised approach to education', while Lord Russell,
a Liberal Democrat peer, described it as 'a substantial damage limitation
exercise'.
Labour claimed that the amendment would have a serious impact on ministers'
plans to allow schools to run teacher training courses on their own. Shadow
education secretary Mrs Ann Taylor said it 'tears out the heart of the
Bill.'
She added: 'After the embarrassing climbdown over student union reforms
there is nothing left to argue about. John Patten should withdraw this
divisive and unnecessary bill immediately.'
Mr Don Foster, Liberal Democrat education spokesman, said: 'Given widespread
opposition to the government's proposals on teacher training, now is the
time for them to admit defeat and withdraw the entire bill.'
Professor Peter Mortimore, director of London University's Institute of
Education commented: 'This makes sense. To cut higher education out of the
equation is wrong and denies the students the chance to gain the skills not
only to do the job but to improve and reflect on it and also to see what
life is like outside that school.'

FT  15 MAR 94 / Battle for Australian pay-TV worthy of the medium: A
struggle between the media heavyweights and the underdogs for satellite
broadcasting licences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The convoluted power games surrounding the introduction of pay-TV in
Australia would do credit to any television soap opera.
On one side are the nation's media heavyweights, including Mr Rupert
Murdoch's News Limited and Mr Kerry Packer's dominant Nine Network, as well
as Telecom, the giant state-owned telecommunications group. They are joined
by Network Ten and Seven Network, two other commercial TV stations, in a
consortium known as PMT.
On the other are a couple of fledgling companies and joint ventures which -
to everyone's surprise - have ended up as holders of two satellite
broadcasting licences.
The big guns want to overturn those licence awards and headed into court
last month, on the grounds that the authorities did not comply with the bid
guidelines, to try to do so. But government ministers appear to have stepped
in - perhaps aware that the pay-TV saga does nothing for Australia's image
and reportedly concerned that one state agency (Telecom) was suing another
(Australian Broadcasting Authority, which awarded the licences). On Friday,
via a five-minute court hearing, the consortium's action was withdrawn.
For one of the licence holders, the recently floated Australis group, this
is a huge relief. Had a legal wrangle developed, its imminent fund-raising
plans, expected to involve about ADollars 200m (Pounds 98.5m), could have
been jeopardised.
But while the underdogs may have won the latest battle, the real question is
whether they have won the war. Analysts, looking at the opposition's clout,
are doubtful.
'Murdoch and Packer are not likely to let Australis steal their market,'
says Mike Magnan, at Pru-Bache Securities.
In theory, Australia's 18m inhabitants should be a ready market for
subscription services. Disposable income is high and TV-watching is an
ingrained habit. About 60 per cent of households have two televisions,
according to a survey by the Australian Broadcasting Authority. About 83 per
cent own a video recorder.
But, for various reasons, pay-TV never got a look-in during the 1980s. This
spared the nation's existing commercial networks any threat to their
revenues. Only in 1991 did the Labor government lift a moratorium on
subscription services.
Even then, it took another two years, and furious political jockeying,
before a system for allocating satellite licences was devised. A two-channel
licence was reserved for the state-owned Australian Broadcasting Corporation
(the C licence). Two other four-channel licences (A and B) were put up for
auction last April.
The A licence was subject to stringent cross-media ownership rules and
designed to attract new entrants. The B licence, by contrast, was expected
to go to the newly formed alliance between Messrs Murdoch and Packer and
Telecom.
But PMT was outbid, and the A and B licences ended up in the hands of two
largely unknown companies, UCOM and New World Telecommunications. Behind
both was a Lebanese-born computer distributer, Mr Albert Hadid.
At the end of 1993, Mr Hadid sold the B licence on to Australis Media,
acting in conjunction with Lenfest, a US-based cable company. The A licence,
meanwhile, went to a joint venture between Continental Venture Capital, an
Australian investment company, and Century Communications, another
second-league US cable operator.
With a legal challenge to Australis in effect now ruled out, observers are
wondering what cards PMT, or its members individually, will play next.
There are some areas that will be closely watched. First, Australis has yet
to tie up any programming. Second, its plan envisages that satellite
services will be delivered into most homes via microwave delivery system
(MDS) which cuts out the need for a satellite dish.
This latter element could prove a problem in the short term, given that Mr
Bob Collins, the former communications minister, decided last year that MDS
delivery of pay-TV should be banned until after the satellite system was up
and running. Australis says that there is nothing to stop the ABA doing
preparatory work on MDS delivery approvals, and then giving the green light
simultaneously with the satellite launch.
But even if these issues are put to one side, it seems that the PMT
pressures on Australis are likely to increase. Most immediate, for example,
is the danger that other technologies for delivering pay-TV will steal a
march or at least woo the most accessible consumers and create enough
confusion to make satellite marketing difficult.
Only days after the PMT lawsuit was filed, a company called Cable Television
Services announced a deal with Telecom which, it claimed, 'would launch
Australia's first pay-TV service in July 1994'.
CTS is headed by Mr Lynton Taylor, a former senior executive at Mr Packer's
Nine Network. He was chairman of the PMT consortium until November. CTS's
plan is to deliver a 10-channel service via a cable network provided by
Telecom. Much of this is in place, with fibre-optic cables extending to the
local exchanges, although Telecom would have to cable the final stretches
into the home.
CTS says it has finalised programming agreements with Turner Broadcasting in
the US, giving it non-exclusive rights to CNN, the Turner Cartoon Channel,
and TNT, the movie channel.
However, it will be months or years before most Australians see any benefit.
Pressed for details, Telecom says the plan is to hook up about five
high-density Sydney suburbs by the July launch date, bringing the CTS
service to perhaps 6,000 homes at the outset. Even on the CTS forecasts,
this cable network will reach only 1.1m homes, a fifth of the nation's
households, in three years' time.
Telecom says that it is in discussions with various other would-be cable
operators. 'There's a high probability that some additional agreements will
be reached, although only two others are of the size of CTS,' says Mr Ross
Kelso, manager of the regulatory and technology aspects of Telecom's pay-TV
strategy.
The telecoms group is also talking about running trials of an alternative
ADSL (asymetric digital subscriber line) cable system in 1995 on a
commercial basis. This would send video images down existing copper wires
into the home. If successful, this might be a cheaper and easier way of
delivering subscription services to outlying areas.
For some observers, then, the final outcome of Australia's pay-TV battle is
plain: PMT, or its members, will end up making life so difficult for
Australis, that either the company, or its B licence, will eventually end up
in the consortium's hands.
Mr Magnan, for example, agrees that this is a likely outcome - 'but not at
these prices', he warns.
For consumers, meanwhile, the upshot is an array of possibilities, many
promises but no service yet. Two decades after pay-TV became available in
the US, Australia - home to some of the world's best-known media moguls - is
still waiting.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Unions cut links with Hosokawa partners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A fresh crack appeared in the structure of Japanese politics yesterday, when
four unions, representing 1.8m voters, cut links with the Social Democratic
party.
This opens the way for more switching of alliances in Premier Morihiro
Hosokawa's seven-party coalition, in which the Socialist party is the
largest member. The unions, representing teachers, municipal, telecom and
postal workers, are members of the 8m-strong Rengo union federation, which
has always backed the SDP.
Unions say they want the freedom to support liberal politicians from the
coalition and opposition Liberal Democratic party, to help create a new
centre-left grouping. This is a stage in the realignment of Japan's politics
pushed on by the recent parliamentary passage of plans to reform the
political system. The coalition and LDP are expected to evolve into two to
three groupings to fight a general election under the new rules late this
year or early next.
The LDP yesterday relaunched its campaign to destabilise Mr Hosokawa. It is
blocking parliamentary debate on next year's budget until he fully discloses
alleged dealings with Sagawa Kyubin, a trucking company involved in a
political corruption scandal.
Mr Hosokawa has admitted he borrowed Y100m (Pounds 641,000) from Sagawa 10
years ago, but repaid this with interest by 1991. He denies LDP allegations
he illegally used the cash in an election, and says this was a private loan.
The LDP budget blockage is causing disquiet at the Finance Ministry, which
has warned it may not be able to deliver Mr Hosokawa's recent tax cuts
without a budget for the fiscal year starting at the end of this month.

The New Zealand government expects to balance its books in the financial

Terry Hall from Wellington.
Last October, the government forecast a deficit of NZDollars 1.8bn (Pounds
686m) this year, and balance by 1996. However, tax revenues were running
NZDollars 800m higher than expected, Mr Birch said, while government
spending was NZDollars 500m less than forecast. He predicted a surplus of
NZDollars 300m next year.

<TEXT>
Experts from the United Nations nuclear safeguards agency have completed
their inspection of North Korea's declared nuclear sites and will leave
Pyongyang today, the agency said yesterday, Reuter reports from Vienna.
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) spokesman Mr David Kyd refused to
say whether the inspections had been a success.
'Certain restrictions were placed on what they could do at one or two
locations and it's a question of how seriously these will be viewed,' he
said.
The US has made unimpeded IAEA inspection of the seven declared sites a
condition for holding high-level talks with the North Koreans in Geneva at
the end of next week.
The talks were part of a package negotiated by the US, North Korea and South
Korea to defuse tensions on the Korean peninsula and stop North Korea from
proceeding with a nuclear arms programme.
If the IAEA's six-man inspection team reports it was prevented from carrying
out a meaningful examination of the nuclear facilities, the deal could be in
danger.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Chinese bring business to new Vietnam: Would-be refugees are
now exporters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAIN SIMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ten years ago, Vuu Khai Thanh spent his life trying to find a way out of
Vietnam for himself and his family. He failed to do so, but now is one of
the most successful entrepreneurs in the country.
Mr Thanh, an animated, gold-toothed man in his mid-40s, runs Binh Tien Imex
Corporation, which is universally known as BiTi's after the shoes the
company manufactures.
Binh Tien was set up in 1982 with 30 workers in two small workshops churning
out rubber sandals for export to eastern Europe.
Now, 11 years later, Binh Tien is worth Dollars 15m (Pounds 8.3m) and
produces some 8m pairs of footwear exported all over Asia and to the rest of
the world.
In the late 1970s, Mr Thanh wanted to leave Vietnam because he is ethnically
Chinese and at that time the government was making a serious effort to force
all ethnic Chinese people out of business. A few years later, the situation
changed and he decided to stay.
'I could have left in 1986 because my brothers and relatives abroad
sponsored me and I was ready,' he says.
'But then I changed my mind because I saw better opportunities in Vietnam
due to the open policy of the government, so I stayed.'
Now, his brothers are coming back. Some have invested in other projects in
Vietnam; others are working to set up representative offices for BiTi's in
the US as soon as the economic embargo is lifted.
Cho Lon, the Chinatown of Ho Chi Minh City, became a ghost town in the late
1970s, as businesses closed and their owners fled, taking whatever they
could carry and hide on small boats sailing across the South China Sea to
Hong Kong and the countries of Southeast Asia.
Until 1975, business in South Vietnam was controlled by the ethnic Chinese
traders and business people in the capital, Saigon.
Now renamed Ho Chi Minh City, it is again the driving force in the country's
economic development and the ethnic Chinese are back in centre stage.
Cho Lon, which literally means big market, is now at the very heart of the
economic reforms in Vietnam.
Chinese-Vietnamese who fled the country in the late 1970s and early 1980s,
most of the first wave of 'Vietnamese boat people' who arrived in Hong Kong
were ethnic Chinese, are beginning to return to Vietnam in search of
investment opportunities.
They are well placed to profit from the government's economic reforms, using
links with family and friends to explore business prospects. Those who have
done best out of the reforms, though, are people like Mr Thanh who never
left the country.
Another man who profited by staying behind is Lo Ky Nguon. He runs Viet Hoa
Construction, which literally means 'Vietnamese-Chinese Construction,' and
he has just been instrumental in establishing the Viet-Hoa Bank.
Viet Hoa Construction was formed five years ago to build the An Dong Centre,
a five-storey market and retail complex with a hotel on top.
The project was intended as a token of the ethnic Chinese community's faith
in Vietnam's economic reforms and all the investors in the project are
ethnic Chinese.
The first development was so successful that the group is now building An
Dong Two on a site next door. This time, the plans are much less modest.
An Dong Two will be a 22-storey block, built of steel and glass, and will,
Mr Nguon says, be the most spectacular building in Cho Lon.
The company is also developing several other commercial sites, as well as
building a series of residential blocks in a joint venture with a Taiwanese
construction company.
Like his counterpart at BiTi's, Mr Nguon stayed in Vietnam when his
relatives and friends were queueing up to leave.
After modest beginnings in manufacturing, he too has become a successful
entrepreneur in Ho Chi Minh City and is acting as an adviser to overseas
Chinese and Sino-Vietnamese who are interested in returning to invest in the
country.
'I have met a lot of friends who lived here, then went abroad but have now
decided to come back and invest here,' Mr Nguon says.
'This is because there is an economic decline in the countries where they
are now living. So they want to invest here again, where the economy is
growing fast.'
Estimates of the wealth that was lost, hidden or smuggled out of the country
by ethnic Chinese people in the 1970s vary widely, but there is no doubt it
runs into the tens of millions of dollars.
Slowly and, in most cases, quietly, a great deal of that money is now being
put back to productive use.

FT  15 MAR 94 / US envoy fails to get Arafat back to talks: Ross returns to
Washington after discussions in Tunis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AP, JULIAN OZANNE and REUTER
</BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Dennis Ross, US special envoy, failed yesterday to win the consent of Mr
Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, for
resuming peace talks with Israel, AP reports from Tunis. Mr Ross, State
Department co-ordinator for the Middle East, left for Washington after two
sessions with Mr Arafat at his Tunis headquarters.
Pressed for comment after the second session, Mr Ross said only that the
talks 'touched on a number of issues including Palestinian concerns about
the security of the Palestinians in the (occupied) territories'. He refused
to elaborate.
Wafa, the PLO news agency, said Mr Arafat renewed demands for 'international
protection for the Palestinian people against massacres committed by the
Israeli army and armed settlers' before the talks could resume. Peace talks
were suspended after a Jewish settler killed 30 Palestinian worshippers in a
West Bank mosque on February 25.
Mr Yassir Abed-Rabbo, a PLO executive committee member, said the talks with
Mr Ross were 'frank and very useful'. But he added that the PLO was still
looking for 'security guarantees for the Palestinians in the occupied
territories'.
Other officials described the discussions as tense. 'Arafat made no
commitment beyond expressing his desire to see the talks restarted. . . but
after the Palestinians get something on the ground,' said an official.
'Arafat did not say the magic words Ross wanted to hear.'
Mr Arafat also received an Israeli delegation yesterday which came to Tunis
reportedly to convey new proposals to lure the PLO back to the negotiating
table. Israel radio reported the peace talks could resume by the end of the
week in Washington if the Tunis contacts went smoothly.
Julian Ozanne adds from Jerusalem: Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister,
who yesterday was preparing to leave for Washington, said: 'I believe we
will put the peace negotiations back on track. Those who want peace have to
know how to overcome painful events.' His government also stepped up the
crackdown on extremist Jewish groups banned and branded terrorists by the
cabinet on Sunday.
Israeli police raided the homes of settlers in the heart of Hebron,
confiscating weapons and issuing arrest orders. Police officials said 23
movement restriction warrants would be served on followers of the two
anti-Arab groups - Kach and Kehane Lives.
Observers said Mr Rabin was determined to have the crackdown under way
before arriving in Washington, where he may face pressure from US officials
to do more to rein in militant Jewish settlers.
Mr Rabin is also likely to come in for criticism for the continuing
aggressive settlements policy of Jews in what the government calls 'Greater
Jerusalem' but which is part of the occupied West Bank.
In Washington, it emerged last night that the US State Department was
considering whether to put Kach and Kahane Lives on its list of terrorist
sponsors after the Hebron massacre.
Reuter adds: Mr Rabin yesterday signed an agreement to add the religious
Shas party to his government coalition, giving him a majority in parliament.
When the accord goes into effect after approval by Mr Rabin's Labour party,
Shas leaders and parliament, the government will be supported by 62 of the
120 parliament members, up from 56.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Long snakes and short ladders in Africa: A formula for
development failure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unseen hands play Snakes and Ladders across sub-Saharan Africa. Democracy
fitfully emerges in South Africa, is denied in Nigeria. Civil war revives in
Angola, Zaire slides towards anarchy, a fragile peace pact holds in
Mozambique.
News is as unpredictable as the throw of the dice. Snakes marked Drought,
Corruption or Civil War writhe across the board; ladders appear as Debt
Rescheduled or World Bank Loan. Short ladders, long snakes. . . and loaded
dice.
As the latest World Bank Sub-Saharan Africa report published at the weekend
makes clear, the destination labelled Recovery remains out of reach. A
decade of structural adjustment, and net aid flows of Dollars 170bn (Pounds
113bn), has stemmed the region's decline but not launched a revival.
'Current growth rates among the best (emphasis added) African performers are
still too low to reduce poverty much in the next two or three decades,'
warns the Bank.
Whoever is to blame, the policy at the heart of relations between Africa and
the west is failing. 'Good governance', the concept which links aid to
Africa with economic reform, human rights and democracy has not got to the
heart of the continent's predicament.
Admirable in principle, complex in practice, today the policy appears
confused. Increasingly the west is placing responsibility for Africa on the
World Bank, but providing neither adequate mandate nor clear guidance.
Once enslaved, later colonised, and marginalised in the 1980s, the continent
faces a continuing crisis in the 1990s - but with a new dimension. Africa is
not only in danger of losing the battle; the world is losing interest. The
countries that led the scramble for Africa's resources some 100 years ago
are now disengaging.
'If only the west cared enough to want to recolonise us,' an African
diplomat ruefully observes. 'But we're hardly an attractive proposition.'
At one level, the west continues to respond positively. Sub-Saharan Africa's
share of global aid is up to 38 per cent in 1991 from 17 per cent in 1970.
But the critical link between economic and political reform is being
neglected, and aid is ineffective.
Under the auspices of the World Bank's economic recovery programme, Africa's
governments were expected to cut budget deficits, curb inflation and
monetary growth, introduce competitive exchange rates, reform tariffs and
revive agriculture. The good news, says Mr Kim Jaycox, the Bank's
vice-president for Africa, is that the formula works: 'The six countries
that improved their policies the most (over the period 1987-91) saw their
GDP growth per capita jump about 2 percentage points per annum between
1981-86 and 1987-91.'
The bad news is that this is not nearly enough. The Bank's claim in a 1989
report that African economies could grow at a rate of 4-5 per cent has
proved optimistic. Growth has been barely half that, well below the region's
3.2 per cent annual rise in population.
Part of the reason for Africa's failure is made clear in the report.
Implementation of the World Bank structural adjustment reforms has been
poor, political will lacking, and management resources scarce.
But essential to the success of economic reforms, donors have argued, is a
matching programme of political reform. Transparency, accountability and
democracy are vital to sustain development, they maintain. The World Bank
report agrees, but it does not address how it can be achieved in practice,
or assess the part political problems have played in Africa's failure to
reach economic targets.
The only reference is to 'a strong social consensus on the need to improve
governance'. Corruption is not mentioned, nor military spending, nor is
there any discussion of a central issue: how to reward reformers, punish
laggards.
Yet the experience of Bank representatives across Africa is that this is
precisely the area which needs attention.
'Structural adjustment means reducing state patronage,' explains a Bank
official in west Africa. 'Reducing patronage undermines the ruling party.
Unless the president is prepared to risk political suicide, there is not
enough I can do to force him down a path of reform, whether it's the big
stick or the big carrot.'
The reason for the report's reticence on 'good governance' issues is not
hard to find. The Bank, officials privately point out, is constrained by a
mandate which precludes it from a political role; and its mandate is
determined by the directors - 'none of whom wants to rock the boat'.
The board's third world appointees tend to reflect the views of their
leaders, who would be the last to support tougher measures, say their
domestic critics. Developed country directors, may be reluctant to
jeopardise commercial or security interests.
But the misgivings of directors representing the biggest donors about
applying tougher pressure on reluctant African reformers stem from a
further, more understandable concern: the generally poor performance of
Africa's opposition parties.
After the high hopes of the 'new wind of change', the wave of
democratisation that swept through Africa in the late 1980s, opposition
parties have turned out to have most of the weaknesses of the regimes they
oppose: ethnically based, few carefully worked out policy alternatives and
likely to be as corrupt if ever they won office.
'Who can blame us for our reluctance to follow through a policy that could
destabilise Nigeria, with its 80m people and huge problems, and where the
opposition seems as incompetent as the army?' asks an irritated European
diplomat.
The report leaves further questions unanswered. If democracy is essential to
sustained growth - the assumption that underpins the concept of good
governance - how can the position of Ghana, under military government until
1992 but the leading reformer, be explained?
As long ago as 1981 the Bank called for 'a new kind of social compact, an
agreement within the world community that the struggle against poverty in
Africa is a joint concern which entails responsibilities for both parties'.
World Bank officials and aid workers argue that Africa's need for such a
compact is overwhelming. But until the west renews its interest in Africa,
resolves the anomalies in its policies, and gives the Bank and other donors
a clearer mandate, the compact will remain a pipe dream.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Israel-PLO talks likely to resume soon: Intensive US
diplomatic efforts near to bearing fruit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation yesterday edged towards
resuming peace talks amid intensive US diplomatic efforts, as Mr Yitzhak
Rabin, Israeli prime minister, prepared to fly to Washington.
'Negotiations are about to be resumed,' said Mr Yossi Sarid, Israel's
environment minister. Mr Sarid said he hoped official talks would begin at
the end of this week and urged the PLO not to set pre-conditions but to
bring their demands to the negotiations.
However, a PLO official in Tunis described the Israeli remarks on early
resumption of talks as 'very optimistic'.
The PLO suspended talks two weeks ago after the massacre of some 30
Palestinians by a Jewish settler in Hebron.
Mr Sarid's comments came after an Israeli delegation led by Mr Uri Savir,
Foreign Ministry director general, met Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, in
Tunis to detail Israel's response to PLO demands on security for
Palestinians in the occupied territories.
Officials said Mr Arafat demanded the deployment of an international force
in the territories to safeguard Palestinian security, and the swift
conclusion of negotiations on Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and
West Bank area of Jericho. Mr Arafat also asked Israel to name a date when
he and his senior colleagues could return to take up residence in Jericho.
Mr Dennis Ross, US Middle East envoy, and Mr Terje Roed Larsen, a Norwegian
mediator, also met Mr Arafat and senior PLO officials in Tunis yesterday to
try to save the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. PLO officials in Tunis
described the meeting as 'crucial', and said they expected Mr Ross to hold a
second meeting with Mr Arafat later last night.
The PLO has said it will not return to formal peace talks until the US and
Russia, co-sponsors of the Middle East peace process, guarantee
implementation of a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning
the Hebron massacre and calling for measures to protect Palestinian lives.
The vote on the UN resolution, due last night, was yesterday postponed for
the fourth time by the Security Council, without explanation.
Before departing for Washington, Mr Rabin said: 'I believe we will put the
peace negotiations back on track. Those who want peace have to know how to
overcome painful events.' His government also stepped up the crackdown on
extremist Jewish groups banned and branded terrorists by the cabinet on
Sunday.
Israeli police raided the homes of settlers in the heart of Hebron,
confiscating weapons and issuing arrest orders. Police officials said 23
movement restriction warrants would be served on followers of the two
anti-Arab groups - Kach and Kehane Lives - which advocate violence against
Palestinians.
Observers said Mr Rabin was determined to have the crackdown under way
before arriving in Washington, where he may face pressure from US officials
to do more to rein in militant Jewish settlers. Mr Rabin is also likely to
come in for criticism for the continuing aggressive settlements policy of
Jews in what the government calls 'Greater Jerusalem' but which is actually
part of the occupied West Bank. More than 206,000 Jews have now settled in
Arab East Jerusalem and the settlements considered part of 'Greater
Jerusalem', outstripping the Palestinian population.

<TEXT>
A senior member of the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom party said yesterday that
the party might still participate in South Africa's first all-race
elections, despite its failure to register candidates for the poll by last
Friday's deadline.
Mr Ben Ngobane, a member of Inkatha's executive, said that 'far from being
out of elections, the IFP has yet to decide on participation or
non-participation'. But the conditions he set for participation may make it
difficult to ensure Inkatha takes part in the April 26-28 poll. He stressed
that international mediation must result in changes to the constitution, and
agreement must be reached on the constitutional status of the Zulu king,
Goodwill Zwelithini, before Inkatha would take part.
African National Congress and Inkatha negotiators are continuing to discuss
the issue of international mediation, but with only six weeks to go until
polling, results may be delayed until near the date. If this happens,
Inkatha is counting on a decision to delay the election, but ANC leader
Nelson Mandela is adamant there will be no delay.
The Independent Electoral Commission has said Inkatha's name has been
deleted from ballot papers being printed at the moment in Britain. But Mr
Ngobane said he believed President FW de Klerk could change the deadline for
registration by proclamation, if he so desired.
President de Klerk warned of the risk of serious violence in Inkatha's Natal
province stronghold if the party boycotted the elections, and ultra-right
leader Eugene Terre'blanche said South Africans were 'heading for chaos, not
an election'.

FT  15 MAR 94 / World Trade News: GEC will build Dollars 1.5bn power station
in India
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE GRAY and ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEC, the big UK industrial group, yesterday signed a memorandum of
understanding worth Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1.02bn) to build a 1,000MW
coal-fired power station in Maharashtra state, India. It will also take a
Dollars 100m equity stake in the project which will sell power to the state
electricity board.
The memorandum was one of three signed yesterday after Mr PV Narasimha Rao,
India's prime minister, saw Mr John Major, his British counterpart, in
London to review the year-old Indo-British Partnership Initiative (IBPI)
established when Mr Major visited India with a group of businessmen in
January 1993.
Rolls-Royce signed a memorandum of understanding to transfer transformer
technology to Kirloskar Electric of Bangalore, and GPT, the telecoms
equipment joint venture between GEC and Siemens, signed one for a
communications contract in Bombay.
Britain is India's largest investor with assets of more than Pounds 2bn.
Co-chairmen of the IBPI told a news conference that it had led to a 26 per
cent increase in UK exports to India and a 20 per cent rise in imports from
India.
The two countries also signed an investment protection agreement, including
intellectual property rights. The UK is the first country with which India
has signed such an agreement.
The accord, aimed at nurturing the IBPI - extended for a further year from
the original one year - offers two-way protection for a wide range of
investments including moveable and immovable property, mortgages, liens,
pledges, shares and stocks.
Mr Robert Evans, chairman of the British side, said that while the latest
Indian budget had been welcomed, there remained reservations in the areas of
transfer of capital, industrial relations, the tax regime and intellectual
property rights.
Dr Jamshed Irani, the Indian chairman, welcomed the initiative's success and
denied that there had been complaints from some smaller Indian companies
about the inequality of the relationship with British partners.
Nuchem-Weir, a joint venture between India's Nuchem Plastics and Weir
Westgarth of the UK, is entering the rapidly-growing bottled drinking water
market in India, Andrew Baxter writes. They will build a water purification
and bottling plant at Nuchem-Weir's headquarters in Faridabad.

FT  15 MAR 94 / World Trade News: China-Gatt talks to resume today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Negotiations on China's application to rejoin the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade resume today, but trade diplomats said yesterday they
expected little progress during the four-day meeting. The latest stand-off
between the US and China over human rights made a breakthrough unlikely.
With the US continuing to threaten non-renewal of China's
most-favoured-nation status because of lack of progress on human rights
issues, US trade officials in Geneva were in no position to offer China the
prospect of early Gatt membership, officials said.
The tense relationship between Washington and Beijing has repeatedly dogged
China's Gatt membership talks, which began in 1987. They came to a halt
after Beijing's suppression of student demonstrations in 1989, and have
since limped along in half-hearted fashion.
However, China is now extremely anxious to speed up the talks with the aim
of joining Gatt by the end of the year, enabling it to become a founding
member of the new World Trade Organisation which will succeed Gatt in 1995.
This aim is backed in principle by most Gatt members, including the European
Union, and supported by Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt director-general, who
wants the WTO to have near-universal membership. Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade
commissioner, has said trade and human rights should be dealt with
separately.
However, the EU and others want China to join with special conditions
reflecting its partial transformation to a market economy, such as
safeguards against surges in exports.

FT  15 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Kumagai sells stake in Thai expressway
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A dispute between Kumagai Gumi, the Japanese construction company, and the
Thai authorities over a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 660m) elevated motorway in
Bangkok was resolved yesterday when a consortium led by Thai investors
bought Kumagai's 65 per cent stake in the project.
The dispute had cast a shadow over other proposed Thai infrastructure
projects because Kumagai and international banks financing the toll-road
accused the Thais of breaching the revenue-sharing contract and effectively
nationalising the road as soon as Kumagai had built the first 20km section.
Full details of the accords signed yesterday were not released, but
executives from both sides said a consortium led by Ch. Karnchang, a Thai
construction company with close links to the armed forces, was buying
Kumagai's equity in the Bangkok Expressway Co (BECL) for about Bt3.5bn
(Pounds 93m).
They also said the new partners in BECL would pay off the dissatisfied
international banks immediately, releasing them from the project in
accordance with their demands, and would pay unpaid creditors - including
construction companies and materials suppliers - as soon as possible.
Kumagai executives put a brave face on yesterday's deal, although at best
the company is likely to have broken even on the project after five years of
work. Higher than expected traffic on the road, boosted by congestion on the
streets of Bangkok below, has now made the project into a cash cow.
Ch. Karnchang executives were jubilant following weeks of negotiations to
secure support from Thai banks and finance companies. They plan to build a
further 10km of the road by October 1996 and to list BECL on the local stock
exchange as soon as possible, a move that will probably mean substantial
capital gains for the new shareholders.
Replacing Kumagai as project manager is a new joint venture including Ch.
Karnchang, its partner Tokyu Construction of Japan, and Bilfinger and Berger
of Germany; they will also be shareholders in BECL.
The foreign banks, including National Westminster, Credit Lyonnais, the
Asian Development Bank and several Japanese banks, previously said were owed
about Dollars 145m.
'The money is to be remitted tonight,' said Mr Athueck Asvanund of legal
firm Baker and McKenzie, which drafted yesterday's agreements for Ch.
Karnchang. He said the next section of the road would be financed by Thai
banks, 'but in the future the company (BECL) would invite foreign banks'. He
added: 'The creditors will be paid but not tomorrow. . . . We need
contractors and contractors need us. Everyone is happy.'

FT  15 MAR 94 / World Trade News: The Japan that insists it can say No says
Yes - Satisfaction in Washington and embarrassment in Tokyo at cell phone
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The young sales lady at the IDO Plaza in central Tokyo reached over the
counter to pick up a mobile phone from a row of nearly a dozen, mostly
Japanese, models the company offers.
She chose a Motorola Microtel.
'If you are thinking of subscribing to a cellular phone service, we have two
systems you can choose from,' she said, brandishing the Motorola.
Whatever the complaints about uneven access to Japan's cellular phones
market the US may have had, in the shops where Motorola's handsets sit side
by side with those of Japanese makers, the trans-Pacific argument over
mobile phones that has become a US crusade to open Japan's markets, seemed
worlds away.
The Japanese government has tried to keep the latest bilateral bickering
strictly in the hands of private business. But the agreement reached over
the weekend dashed any hopes that in the world of US-Japanese trade anything
that promises as much profitable growth and fierce competition as Japan's
mobile phones market can be left strictly free of government intervention.
The agreement between Motorola and IDO, the Japanese mobile phone operator
has, for now, satisfied both the US government's, and Motorola's, contention
that greater investment by IDO in Motorola's system was needed to ensure
fair access to the Japanese mobile phones market.
The US side has hailed the agreement as a model that could be used to
resolve other bilateral trade disputes. For US negotiators who have been
angered by Japan's refusal to agree to measurable indicators in opening the
country's markets to imports, the IDO-Motorola deal contains just about
everything they have been calling for.
There are concrete figures - IDO has consented to build 159 additional base
stations for Motorola's mobile phones systems in the Tokyo-Nagoya region and
reallocate 1.5MHz of radio frequency to the US system.
There is a time scale - IDO has consented to begin operating those
additional base stations and provide coverage to 95 per cent of the
population in its region by the end of fiscal 1995.
And, most important, there is a government pledge to ensure that IDO carries
out its commitments. The Japanese government agreed to monitor IDO's
progress in fulfilling those goals and to 'take all available measures to
ensure compliance'.
'We think (the agreement) ends a long 10 years of frustration,' Mr Walter
Mondale, US ambassador to Japan, said yesterday. 'We believe that both
Motorola and IDO are pleased with it and that it is good news for the
Japanese consumer.'
In Japan, however, officials have found themselves desperately fighting any
suggestion that the government has caved in to US demands.
Having resisted just a month ago US calls for the setting of numerical
indicators to measure the openness of its markets and having underlined, to
wide public acclaim, the 'need to say No' at times to US demands, the
government appears to have turned around completely and swallowed precisely
those demands.
The government has tried to pretend that its involvement was limited to
merely giving its stamp of approval to a private business agreement. Mr
Takenori Kanzaki, the minister of posts and telecommunications, stressed
that the agreement did not represent Japanese acceptance of US demands for
objective criteria in opening up the country's markets.
Mr Masayoshi Takemura, the chief cabinet secretary, was yesterday also
obliged to defend the Japanese position, stating that Japan had not bowed to
US pressure.
'It is not that we yielded to US pressure, but the agreement was reached
after private level talks made headway,' he said.
Their defence of the Japanese position reflects the extent of public concern
in Japan that the mobile phones agreement has sent the wrong signal to the
US.
The fear in Japan is that not only has the agreement confirmed US suspicions
that trade can be 'managed' by applying sufficient pressure on the Japanese
government in the form of threats of sanctions, it has also provided the US
with a strong case for proceeding in a similar manner on other bilateral
trade issues.
Despite protests to the contrary, the Japanese bureaucracy's central role in
the negotiations is well recognised. 'I thought it was charming to sit in
the ministry of posts and telecommunications and to hear that the government
was not involved,' Mr Mondale said yesterday.
Neither has IDO managed to hide its unhappiness with the deal. 'The
agreement is not all positive,' Mr Toshio Enomoto, vice president of IDO
said in reference to the enormous capital investment the company is being
forced to make in Motorola equipment - up to Y60bn (Pounds 380m) from a
planned Y27bn.
And while Japanese officials were at pains to explain that the agreement
would not set a precedent for other bilateral trade deals, the US side is
already pointing to the deal as a model for others to come.
By showing what can be achieved when decisions are made at high government
levels, when the two sides get practical and results-oriented, the agreement
provides a lesson for 'how to proceed on other matters', Mr Mondale said.
If that is the lesson the US learned from the agreement, Japanese concerns
that it has set a risky precedent could prove well founded.

<TEXT>
Germany yesterday rejected a US proposal at the Group of Seven jobs summit
in Detroit to establish new G7 working parties to exchange ideas on
unemployment, education and training. The proposal failed to find favour
with the UK, too.
'This is superfluous, we can talk about these things through the OECD,' said
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, German economics minister. He also rejected US pressure
for further macroeconomic stimulus, saying Germany was already providing
such stimulus through its huge investments in the east German economy.
While stressing what Germany could learn from the more flexible and
deregulated US labour market, German ministers also stressed Germany's model
qualities, in particular in training.
Mr Norbert Blum, German labour minister, said the US labour market model was
not compatible with European social standards. But he also warned that 3m
jobs for lower-skilled workers would disappear in Germany within eight years
and that more creativity and flexibility was required in German companies.
Mr Blum welcomed the recent flexibility shown by the German pay bargaining
system and said the country had to move towards a system in which minimum
rates were set at national level and wages were then topped up at plant or
company level dependent on performance.
Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, said that no country was doing
more than Germany to consolidate its public finances. In due time this would
allow further cuts in interest rates, he said.
Mr Rexrodt stressed the closeness of US-German links, but, like other G7
countries, he was critical of the bilateral trade discussions between the US
and Japan.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor, rejected the idea that there was a
significant gulf between British and US labour market thinking. 'We are very
much in the mainstream of G7 thinking. US and UK policy is very close
indeed. We are nearer to the Americans than the continental Europeans. But
all of us are going to have to change,' he said.
Speaking at a working session yesterday afternoon, the first day of the
two-day summit, Mr Clarke stressed the importance of active labour market
measures - including training and small business stimulation - as well as
policies promoting labour market deregulation.

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Congressman Dan Rostenkowski, the powerful chairman of the House ways and
means committee, faces the political race of his life today when voters from
Chicago's mean westside streets and a scattering of suburban neighbourhoods
vote in a Democratic primary ahead of November's mid-term elections.
Encumbered by a federal investigation into misuse of House post office
funds, Mr Rostenkowski, after 35 years in Congress, is facing rare
opposition from Mr John Cullerton, a junior state senator who has shaken the
Democratic establishment by daring to mount a challenge. Mr Cullerton has
proved nearly as popular as the incumbent in recent polls.
With President Bill Clinton depending on Mr Rostenkowski's clout to
strongarm through a new national healthcare package, a defeat in today's
primary would be a blow to both the administration and the Democratic party.
Also at stake is the stream of pork barrel dollars that Mr Rostenkowski has
directed toward Chicago since 1958, when he arrived in Congress.
Mr Rostenkowski, 66, is the most skilful of Chicago's Democratic backroom
dealers, but has proved ill-prepared to deal with the year-long
investigation into his financial dealings. The federal probe has yielded
reams of bad press but no indictment, and has been difficult for the
Democratic machine to rebutt.
Mr Clinton broke the wall of silence last month, when he travelled to
Chicago against the wishes of Ms Janet Reno, the attorney-general, and
appeared with Mr Rostenkowski to boost his healthcare programme and the
Congressman's election prospects.
Since then a stream of Washington celebrities have been pounding Chicago's
podiums on Mr Rostenkowski's behalf, and millions of federal dollars, in the
form of a jobs training centre and a fire and rescue helicopter, have been
awarded to the city.
Even with these last-minute offerings, weekend polls showed Mr Rostenkowski
with only a slim lead, garnering 27 per cent of decided potential voters,
with Mr Cullerton on 24 per cent.
However, with voter registration in Chicago at its lowest in 60 years for an
off-year election, apathy may favour Mr Rostenkowski.
In the end it may be Chicago's old-fashioned system of Democratic ward
committeemen that comes through for Mr Rostenkowski.
Chicago's Mayor Richard Daley has stood firmly behind the congressman
throughout the campaign, and today is expected to bless the unpaid leave of
hundreds of city workers who will door-knock throughout the fifth district
to boost turnout for Mr Rostenkowski.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Chile eyes trade accord with US: President Frei 'inseparably
wedded' to export-led development
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Chile has a 'good chance' of concluding a free-trade agreement with the US
by the end of this year or the start of 1995, Mr Eduardo Aninat, Chile's new
finance minister, said yesterday.
Mr Aninat said the new administration of President Eduardo Frei had been
assured by Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, that Chile was next in
line for an agreement. It was still not clear whether this would take the
form of a bilateral deal with the US or accession to the trilateral North
American Free Trade Agreement, Mr Aninat said.
Addressing a foreign investment convention in Santiago of more than 100
company executives, Mr Aninat said Chile would continue the process of
opening up its economy. It would seek to reduce tariffs and gradually open
up its capital account, though there would be no 'adventures' that might
destabilise exchange rate policy or threaten growth.
Mr Aninat foresaw a step-by-step relaxation of restrictions to foreign
investment - such as the one-year period for capital repatriation - over the
next six years, but not in 'the very short term'.
He predicted that this year would see growth of 4.5 per cent and an
investment rate of about 28 per cent, one point higher than the record level
achieved in 1993.
Mr Frei, who assumed power last Friday, told the convention that he was
'inseparably wedded' to the export-led development model, which he predicted
would allow Chile to double the size of its economy in the next decade.
That growth would be harnessed to eradicating extreme poverty by the end of
the century, one of the 'great tasks' of his government. For this, there was
not only a 'moral imperative,' but also 'an important economic objective' in
terms of expanding the domestic market and ensuring social stability, he
said.
Mr Ricardo Lagos, minister of public works, said growth and poverty
eradication would require huge improvements in infrastructure. He estimated
that Dollars 33bn (Pounds 22bn) would have to be invested by 2010, a goal
that would demand the co-operation of the public and private sectors on an
unprecedented scale. The government had 'set a target' of spending Dollars
1.5bn a year on infrastructure, double the amount allocated in the 1993
budget, he said.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Camacho doubt confuses poll calculations: Damian Fraser
studies form in Mexico's presidential race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Judging by most opinion polls Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary
party (PRI) will coast to victory in August's presidential election. But in
a country where there is little tradition of testing political opinion
honestly, the reliability of such polls has been attacked fiercely.
While the polls differ, the PRI's clear advantage is undisputed. A Harris
poll paid for by Mexico's businessmen's organisation gives it some 51 per
cent of the vote, against 17 per cent for the left-wing opposition Party of
Democratic Revolution (PRD). Even the poll least favourable to the PRI - by
Mori of Mexico - gives the party's candidate a 16 point lead over his
nearest rival.
The possibility that Mr Manuel Camacho, the government's peace envoy in the
southern state of Chiapas, might challenge the PRI's official candidate, Mr
Luis Donaldo Colosio, for the presidency complicates the picture.
His candidacy would probably both divide the PRI and take support from Mr
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the PRD candidate. But since Mr Colosio is currently
ahead of Mr Cardenas, according to the latest Mori opinion poll, the PRI
candidate has most to lose from a Camacho candidacy.
Under Mexico's electoral rules, an opposition party can change its candidate
up to a month before the August 21 elections. With the two main opposition
parties apparently committed to their candidates, Mr Camacho would have to
persuade one of the smaller parties' candidates to make way for him - which
may not be easy.
Even if Mr Camacho decides not to run, as is still perhaps most likely, he
is sure to remain a thorn in Mr Colosio's side and thereby provide another
element of uncertainty in the run-up to the election.
The PRD reckons voters are in any case highly volatile, and that much can
change before the election. At this time six years ago Mr Carlos Salinas was
well ahead of Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas in the polls, only to see his advantage
almost disappear.
Mr Miguel Basanez, head of Mori of Mexico and publisher of the opinion
magazine Este Pais, concludes that although the PRI is well ahead, the race
is closer than it looks. In his view, the undecided are more likely to vote
for opposition than government. If so, current declared support for Mr
Colosio, at an average of around 37 per cent, is far short of what is
necessary to win.
Critics of the polls further argue that many are biased in the governing
party's favour, either deliberately or unintentionally. Mr Basanez says
that, in an authoritarian culture, people are afraid of saying they will
vote for the opposition. Unless the pollster's neutrality is clear, then,
support for the PRI will be artificially high.
In a recent survey Mr Basanez told those questioned the poll was for the
PRI, and found that the party won 60 per cent support. When he told them the
poll was being conducted for Este Pais, support dropped to 36 per cent,
against 20 per cent for Mr Cardenas and 29 per cent undecided.
However, Mr Abraham Nadelsticher, head of Pearson, a Mexican market and
public opinion research firm, says there is no evidence Mexicans lie in
polls, and says techniques such as secret balloting can protect those
fearful of saying whom are they will support.
Such a view is shared by Mr Salinas's pollster, Mr Ulises Beltran. He says
the undecided are no more likely to vote for the opposition than the
government, and that since 1988 his polls on state elections coincided with
the eventual result, indicating that they are a reliable guide to election
returns.
Cynics like Mr Basanez say this is because electoral results are manipulated
to coincide with government polls.

Colombia's voters have chosen former development minister Mr Ernesto Samper
as the Liberal party candidate for the presidential election and returned a
Liberal majority to Congress, writes Sarita Kendall in Bogota.
However, the abstention rate in Sunday's poll, at about 70 per cent, was
very high and voting was affected by the guerrilla presence in a number of
areas. The former guerrilla movement, M-19, performed poorly, taking a less
than 5 per cent of the vote, according to projections. Gainers included
Christian movements and independents.
Mr Samper said the Liberal party must head the transformation which would
restore credibility to Colombian politics.

Almost three quarters of young French people are so keen to find work that
they will take any job they can get, according to an opinion poll published
yesterday. The poll for the business daily La Tribune showed that 73 per
cent of those aged between 18 and 24 would accept any job. It also showed
that 66 per cent said job security was a priority, ahead of an adequate wage
or a challenging career. France has an unusually high rate of youth
unemployment - one young person in four below the age of 26 is out of work.

Improved economic fundamentals, easier monetary conditions and private
sector financial consolidation have paved the way for sustained recovery of
Norway's oil-dependent economy, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development says. However, structural reforms are needed to improve
efficiency and reduce the budget deficit. It predicts real growth in gross
domestic product of more than 3 per cent in 1994 and nearly 4 per cent in
1995. The economy excluding oil is set to expand by respectively 2.25 per
cent and 3 per cent. Unemployment, currently at 6 per cent, is expected to
decline only slightly. An extensive overhaul of the labour market is needed
as unemployment growth can no longer be stemmed by fiscal stimulus and
public sector job creation.

There are signs that Spain is emerging from recession but its welfare system
must adapt to survive, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, said. A
slowdown in the growth of registered unemployment last month showed that the
economy was picking up, he told the Efe news agency. The improvement would
be seen mainly in exports, tourism and construction, he said. Mr Alfredo
Pastor, the economy minister, reaffirmed expectations of export-led growth
of 1.3 per cent this year against negative growth of 1 per cent in 1993. He
hinted there might be room for further interest rate cuts following a
half-point cut in the official benchmark rate to 8 per cent earlier this
month. Spain's broad M4 money supply fell 6.3 per cent in February.

Former Slovak foreign minister Jozef Moravcik was chosen by a coalition of

minister, presidential spokesman Jan Findra said. President Michal Kovac had
approved the nomination, the spokesman said. Mr Meciar (pictured left),
independent Slovakia's first prime minister, was ousted in a vote of no
confidence on Friday after bickering with President Kovac and a stream of
dismissals and resignations by ministers and members of his own party. Mr
Moravcik was chosen by the leaders of the broad coalition following
negotiations. He is expected to deliver a new government list to President
Kovac for approval within days. He was Czechoslovakia's last foreign
minister under the federal system which split into independent Czech and
Slovak states in January 1993. A former member of Mr Meciar's party, he
defected to form a breakaway faction in February.

Strikes across Russia's coal industry subsided yesterday as miners began to
receive wages overdue from December and January. However, thousands of
workers have yet to return to the pits and some union leaders are
threatening to turn their financial grievances into demands for a new
government. Stoppages took place throughout Russia's coal regions last week.
They are also seeking Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.7bn) in state support for the
debt-ridden industry.
The government has argued that such aid would fuel inflation and put too
much pressure on the budget. Moscow is already struggling to keep the
deficit down to 10 per cent of gross domestic product this year. Miners'
leaders will meet later this week to decide on any further action.

Russia and the US yesterday acknowledged that the 'honeymoon' between them
was over and that they were fated to have disagreements. But they also
agreed to remain yoked in a partnership which, it was stressed, was one of
equals.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, and Mr Warren Christopher, US
secretary of state, met for talks in the far eastern Russian port of
Vladivostok. Their one-day meeting came after Russia expressed anger over
what it saw as Nato's failure to consult it over air strikes in Bosnia. It
was also prompted by differences over withdrawal of Russian troops from the
Baltic states and a growing swell of opinion in the US that the two
countries' attempts to forge a close partnership is - in the words of Mr
Zbigniew Brzezinski, former US national security adviser - 'premature'. Mr
Kozyrev said after the talks Russia and the US were building a 'mature
relationship' of equals that would survive differences. Mr Christopher said:
'We recognise that as large nations with large interests we are bound to
have differences, but we pledge to deal with our differences openly.'
Mr Pavel Grachev, Russia's defence minister, postponed a trip and remained
in Moscow to ensure reliable control of Russia's nuclear forces while
President Boris Yeltsin was on leave, the Defence Ministry said yesterday.
Mr Yeltsin earlier in the day left for an unannounced holiday by the Black
Sea, saying he was still weak after an illness but confident of calm in
Russia.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Italian Elections, March 27: Pollsters keep eye on Italy's
red-belt frontier - Robert Graham visits a microcosm of the country's
fast-changing political geography
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The medieval city of Viterbo once bristled with 240 defence towers. From its
strategic position on the slopes of Mount Cimino, 50 miles north of Rome,
Viterbo has historically controlled the main access to the city from
northern Italy.
Today Viterbo still serves a strategic function but of a rather different
nature. The town and its unspoiled agricultural hinterland represent the
southern frontier of the so-called red belt - the swathe across central
Italy dominated throughout the post-war era by the Communist party,
transformed since 1991 into the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS).
As campaigning moves into top gear for the general elections on March 27,
this electoral college of 245,000 voters has become a microcosm of Italy's
fast-changing political geography.
The left is struggling to retain its hegemony, the once powerful centre
parties are in retreat and the right is pushing up from the south claiming
new respectability under the umbrella of media magnate Silvio Berlusconi's
Forza Italia movement.
'This has always been the frontier with the red belt where upper Lazio
touches the border with Tuscany,' says Dr Ferdinando Signorelli, three times
senator for the neo-fascist MSI. 'Now they and the centre parties are paying
the price for having wasted money with such poor results in local
administration.'
Dr Signorelli, a prominent local surgeon working in a private clinic, cites
the example of Viterbo's new state-run regional hospital. It was started in
1970 and since 1990 has been left unfinished at a cost of L180bn (Pounds
72m).
Dr Signorelli is of the old school, proud to talk of Mussolini's
achievements in health-care and paying little heed to the two month-old
metamorphosis of the MSI into the National Alliance. He claims he is
sufficiently known to spend little on his campaign for the one senatorial
seat of Viterbo backed by Forza Italia.
Mr Berlusconi's movement first appeared on the scene in this town last
November. In four months over 40 Forza Italia support clubs have been set up
in and around Viterbo. The technique has been the same as elsewhere in
Italy.
The prime mover has been Publitalia, the advertising arm of Mr Berlusconi's
Fininvest media holding. The network of Publitalia's representatives and
contacts has been used to recruit Forza Italia members, often through Lions
and Rotary clubs.
A dentist from a well-known local family, Mr Giuseppe Lazzarini, was
persuaded to enter politics as the Forza Italia flag-bearer. He is now
contesting one of two Viterbo seats in the chamber of deputies backed by the
National Alliance.
Mr Berlusconi has never visited the region to spread his promises of
creating jobs and preventing the wicked left from entering government. He
does not need to. His message and catchy Forza Italia's campaign song came
here via the television.
The right has had a strong niche in Viterbo ever since Mussolini established
it as a separate province in 1927.
But since 1946 the Communist party either held power alone or shared it
discreetly in local administrations with the parties in the national
government. This state of affairs continued after the Communists transformed
themselves into the PDS in 1991.
After provincial elections last June, it looked as though the PDS had once
proven its superior organisation. A PDS-led alliance with other left-wing
parties won 63 per cent of the vote. The Christian Democrat and Socialist
vote slumped, while support for the MSI almost doubled to nearly 20 per
cent.
The threat of the PDS-dominated Progressives repeating this triumph in the
general elections has provoked a backlash which in turn has helped polarise
local opinion. The Christian Democrats split in January with the mainstream
forming the Popular party (PPI) and part of it, the newly-baptised Christian
Democratic Centre, allied with Forza Italia and the National Alliance.
'We feel squeezed in the centre,' says Mrs Luisa La Malfa, an educationalist
running for the chamber of deputies for the allied central grouping of the
PPI and Mr Mario Segni's Italian Pact.
'The traditional catholic electorate is confused. The rural vote we feel
will hold up for us; but for the rest we have to rely on people mistrusting
the left and finding the new right distasteful,' says Mrs La Malfa, the
sister of Mr Giorgio La Malfa, leader of the small Republican party.
She feels possessing an easily identifiable name is a clear help; but she
also believes local issues are important. The main local issue is the extent
to which Viterbo should be drawn into Rome's commuter orbit.
There is also a big environmental problem. The fate of the power station at
Montalto di Castro near Civitavecchia - blocked by the 1987 nuclear power
referendum - has put the Greens at odds with their allies, the PDS. Here as
elsewhere, the PDS also enjoys an uneasy relationship with the hardline
communists who split to form Reconstructed Communism.
All this suggests a closer contest than in the provincial elections of June.
The PDS has been placed on the defensive; and if the right does well here
and captures a seat in the chamber it will mark a big shift in political
allegiance.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Collision raises Bosporus questions: The oil tanker disaster
near the Black Sea mouth of the busy strait has again raised the issue of
rights of passage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turkey's concerns over increased tanker traffic through the Bosporus were
brought home with a vengeance over the weekend with a fatal mid-channel
collision, which left at least 15 crew dead, up to 16 missing, and the
threat of a hazardous oil spill in one of the world's most densely populated
international waterways.
'It is tragic that an accident like this has to occur for us to be able to
make our case,' said Mr Timur Erkmen, a maritime expert in the Turkish prime
minister's office.
The accident, late on Sunday night, resulted when the Nassia, a
Greek-Cypriot registered oil tanker, collided with a coaster near the Black
Sea mouth of the strait. Last night the ship was still burning. An official
at the Turkish port authorities warned of large-scale environmental
pollution if the wind changed.
Unhindered passage for all merchant ships traversing the Bosporus and
Dardanelles, which divide Europe and Asia, is guaranteed under the 1936
Montreux Convention.
Only warships require permission of the signatory countries, which was an
important control over the Soviet Union's fleet during the cold war.
Although the passage is considered dangerous with erratic currents and 12
narrow turns, it is not obligatory to take navigational pilots. The Istanbul
maritime authority estimates that fewer than half of the 40,000 vessels
which traverse the Bosporus each year take a pilot on board.
Currently the only means of regulating the traffic is through the sanitary
checks, which all vessels have to undergo.
In the wake of the break-up of the former Soviet Union, trade volumes have
increased sharply as the Bosporus is for many of the newly emerging states
the most direct route to western markets.
Additional traffic is expected following last year's opening of the
Mainz-Danube central European canal system, linking the Baltic with the
Black Sea.
However, Turkey's particular concern is over the threat posed by a large
increase in oil cargoes if the central Asian countries choose to ship new
finds to western markets via the Bosporus.
According to Turkish estimates, an additional 75m tonnes of crude would pass
every year through the strait if the Black Sea route is used, compared with
around 5m tonnes today.
Azerbaijan is currently in final negotiations with a western oil consortium
led by British Petroleum.
Kazakhstan is developing the vast Tenghiz field. The issue is of particular
concern for the Russians, who want both countries to utilise the existing
Russian port at Novorossysk
The Turkish government has raised its concerns with the International
Maritime Organisation, the United Nations body which handles maritime
disputes. From July, Turkey will introduce new rules for vessels longer than
150 metres, in a decision clearly aimed at the oil tankers. The changes
include the introduction of new traffic lanes, and restrictions on large
vessels using the strait at night. Yesterday the governor of Istanbul, Mr
Hayri Kozakcioglu, warned: 'No further growth in tanker traffic should be
allowed.' The Turkish foreign minister, Mr Hikmet Cetin, called for an end
to all explosive materials being shipped through the Bosporus.
Restricting the Bosporus passage will add costly delays. Turkish officials
believe it may also force the oil companies to consider more favourably
Turkey's own proposal to build a pipeline to the Mediterranean.
In a related development, Lloyds of London has been commissioned by an
unnamed group of US oil companies to consider navigational and environmental
safety problems posed by additional traffic through the Bosporus.
However, the issue has thrown up an awkward dilemma for the Turks.
While conscious of the environmental threat to Istanbul's 10m inhabitants,
Turkey is also aware that the dispute could damage its relations, not just
with Russia, but with all the littoral states on the Black Sea, with whom it
is attempting to cement political and economic ties.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Serbs put new price on Bosnia peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER and JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Nikola Koljevic, vice-president of the self-styled Serbian republic in
Bosnia, said yesterday that the region's Serbs would back a Washington peace
plan - which already envisages creating a Bosnian-Croat and Moslem
federation - if any Bosnian Serb territory could link up with Serbia proper.
The preconditions, put forward in Belgrade yesterday, are aimed at expanding
the proposed federation of Bosnia to a broader confederation encompassing
Serbia and Montenegro. In effect, it would re-invent part of ex-Yugoslavia.
Mr Koljevic was speaking after holding talks with Mr Vitaly Churkin,
Russia's special envoy to the region. But western diplomats in Belgrade said
any preconditions could undermine the Washington plan - which is due to be
signed in the US on Friday - because Croats and Moslems would not accept any
re-invention of the old Yugoslavia.
Croatia's fight for independence was about breaking away from Serb-dominated
Yugoslavia.
More importantly, UN and US diplomats in Vienna, who are hosting the Bosnian
Croat/Moslem talks, said the viability of any Croat/Moslem federation would
require Bosnian Serbs ceding control of land they hold in the republic to
about 49 per cent.
They already control about 70 per cent of the territory and show no signs of
giving up any land.
Mr Koljevic said it was 'difficult to believe that this (confederation) is a
serious possibility because the other two sides have rejected any
confederation with Yugoslavia'. Mr Churkin and Mr Charles Redman, the US
special envoy to the former Yugoslavia, require consent from President
Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, and the Bosnian Serbs, for the federal plan
for Bosnia.
Without the full, and unconditional, consent of the Serbs the federation is
meaningless because it will have no agreed boundaries between the federation
and Serb-held territories in Bosnia.
Mr Koljevic said the Bosnian Serbs were willing first to negotiate a peace
agreement, but they would only attend talks 'under equal conditions',
implying that sanctions on Serbia would have to be first lifted.
A UN official said yesterday the US might be prepared to lift the sanctions
if Mr Milosevic agreed to extend diplomatic recognition to Croatia.
This would mean recognising the republic's borders, as well as disowning the
Krajina Serbs, who have declared their autonomy in south-western Croatia.

FT  15 MAR 94 / 'Whispering arrow' on target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LATHEN, NORTH-WEST GERMANY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
There was an anxious silence in the cabin. One of the Transrapid executives
had been explaining the ins and outs of the so-called 'whispering arrow' but
as it exceeded 380kph (236mph) he stopped talking.
The green liquid crystal display over the doorway to the cabin showed 400kph
and the 50 or so passengers watched carefully as the figures crept up to
421kph and locked in.
Mr Peter Wiegelmann began talking again. 'Ladies and gentlemen, there you
have it - 421kph. For safety reasons we cannot take you up to the maximum
speed of 450kph but I am sure that was quite impressive enough.'
The tree tops, which were at window level outside, blurred into a green mass
and not one of a cluster of buildings which made up the Transrapid test site
in Lathen, near the Dutch border, was recognisable as we shot past. Writing
at 421kph was not a problem and expansive seats - larger than they are
likely to be in the real Transrapid - made for ample leg-room. Sound levels
inside the cabin were not louder than those in a French high-speed Train a
Grande Vitesse (TGV) or the German ICE.
A murmur of approval could be heard as we slowed down to 170kph and heads
nodded in awe at the world's fastest magnetic-levitation train.
'You should see what it's like in the summer,' Mr Wiegelmann said as we
climbed up the stairs to board the train. 'People pull up here in their
campers and wait for days to get a ride. It's amazing.' The Transrapid,
which tears around on a 32km concrete track built on stilts, has lured
thousands of visitors to this flat corner of north-western Germany,
difficult to get to and visited by few.
Half the train is a cabin to seat about 50 people while the other houses a
bank of computers at which engineers from Thyssen Industrie, the engineering
group which built the Transrapid, test the train's capabilities.
On March 2 the German cabinet approved plans to build a 300km track from
Berlin to Hamburg, the country's two largest cities, which would reduce the
present travel time of more than three-and-a-half hours to 53 minutes.
'Travelling to either one of those cities will then be the same as taking a
subway to one of the outlying areas of Hamburg,' said Mr Wiegelmann who does
publicity work for Magnetschnellbahn, the company created to oversee the
introduction of the Transrapid.
However, the opposition Social Democratic party (SPD) has vowed to block the
project in the upper house of parliament. It says the Berlin run would be a
white elephant, failing to meet the projected annual passenger target of
14m, an eight-fold increase on the present volume.
Thyssen Industrie is pushing hard to have the project approved. Company
executives are bullish all the same. When the TGV from Paris to Lyon was
first being considered 6m passengers a year were predicted. Last year 21m
people travelled that route, proof, Thyssen says, that if the Transrapid is
built passenger volume will rise dramatically.
The train is also safer than all other forms of conventional transport, Mr
Wiegelmann says. It cannot derail because the entire train straddles the
concrete runway. And only one train will travel along the route at any one
time, making collisions impossible. All that can go wrong is that the
electricity - needed to drive the magnetic motors - is cut off, but even
then the train has its own emergency generating system which will enable it
to coast to a standstill.
While environmentalists say the concrete runway on stilts is an unwarranted
eyesore, Transrapid supporters point out that cows and wildlife are free to
graze underneath the track which causes much less disruption than
conventional railways. In answer to charges that the train is too noisy,
independent experts have recorded just 81 decibels at 300kph, half the noise
generated by the TGV.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Madrid-Seville fast rail link heads for profit: The success
of Spain's high-speed train gives hope to the makers of Germany's Transrapid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS

<TEXT>
Billed as a white elephant, the AVE, Spain's high-speed train between Madrid
and Seville, is confounding its critics. The AVE almost broke even in its
first full year of service and it is set to become one of the few profitable
units in the deficit-ridden railway network.
According to provisional 1993 results, the AVE generated income of Pta13.5bn
(Pounds 65m) and reported losses of Pta90m after paying back Pta4.3bn on
loans to acquire the 16 trains it operates, similar to those running on
France's Train a Grande Vitesse (TGV) system and built by the same
Anglo-French engineering group, GEC-Alsthom.
This year the high-speed train unit aims to raise its total number of
passengers by 24 per cent to nearly 4m and to post a profit. By 1998, with
expected income of more than Pta22bn, the unit says it will have paid off
its Pta45bn rolling stock investment. The Pta450bn construction bill for the
471km link between Madrid and Seville - a track built to the narrower
European gauge specifications and which includes 17km of tunnels and 32
viaducts - has been picked up by the Transport Ministry.
'There has been an incredible difference between the speculation that
surrounded the AVE and what has turned out to be the reality,' said Mr Jose
Alberto Zaragoza, the planning chief at the Transport Ministry. The decision
to build the link, which opened in time for Seville's Expo '92 Universal
Exposition, prompted critics to charge that Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez
had favoured his home town and ignored economic common sense which dictated
linking Madrid to Barcelona, twice as wealthy and as large as Seville, and
to the French frontier.
The government countered that the AVE had been routed to Seville to prevent
the underdeveloped south decoupling from the richer north and officials
dubbed the policy the 'Mezzogiorno factor' after the regional imbalances in
Italy that Spain wanted to prevent. It was 'a very political decision', said
Mr Zaragoza.
AVE's success, which has slashed the railway travel time between Madrid and
Seville from 5 hours and 55 minutes to 2 hours and 40 minutes, has
underlined the lessons learnt by France's experiment. The high-speed train
captures the largest share of the travel market. Before AVE went into
service, 51 per cent of travellers between Madrid and Seville used a car and
20 per cent went by train; now 39 per cent drive and 44 per cent take the
AVE.
Air travel is particularly penalised by competition from a high-speed train
link. Before the AVE, Iberia, the domestic carrier, accounted for 18 per
cent of Madrid-Seville travel. This has dropped to 7 per cent and the
airline, which has already cut its 71 flights a week between the two cities
to 64, plans to reduce them to 52.
High-speed trains generate new customers. Of AVE users 24 per cent had never
previously travelled between Madrid and Seville.
Building on the AVE's success, the Transport Ministry has given the green
light to the Madrid-French frontier link, which should be completed by 2003.

FT  15 MAR 94 / SNCF and BR may act on Eurotunnel delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SNCF and British Rail, the French and UK railway operators, may demand
compensation from Eurotunnel for the delay in the start of freight services
through the Channel Tunnel, according to Mr Alain Poinssot, head of SNCF's
freight division.
Speaking at a joint press conference with Mr Ian Brown, his British Rail
counterpart, Mr Poinssot said that the delay in the launch of freight
operations, which were due to have started yesterday, entailed significant
costs both in terms of lost revenues and the uncertainty facing clients.
Mr Poinssot said that the loss of earnings was being evaluated by his
company's lawyers. British Rail and SNCF are already involved in a dispute
with Eurotunnel concerning the fees for use of the Channel Tunnel rail link.
Eurotunnel has not set a firm timetable for its services following last
month's announcement of delays due to the complex commissioning and testing
process. The official opening of the Channel Tunnel will go ahead as planned
on May 6.
Despite the desire for compensation, Mr Poinssot said that the delay in
services should be put into context. 'The tree should not obscure the
forest,' he said, describing freight services through the Tunnel as
'revolutionary'. Mr Brown estimated that by 1996-1997, the annual volume of
freight passing through the tunnel would amount to more than 6m tonnes.
About 60 per cent of this would be represented by container traffic.
Automobile shipments are expected to account for 25 per cent of total
freight.
According to Mr Brown, the work needed to prepare for the launch of Channel
Tunnel freight services had been completed last weekend. He said that
services would be expanded progressively, starting with 10 trains per day in
each direction and increasing to 35 trains each way by 1995-1996.
Mr Brown said that the launch of freight traffic services through the Tunnel
was of particular importance to British Rail. 'The tunnel is a 50km journey,
but it joins the UK's 15,000km network to the 240,000km continental rail
network,' he said, adding that it would provide an important stimulus to
demand for rail freight.
British Rail and SNCF have set up a series of joint ventures to manage and
market their Channel Tunnel freight services. British Rail has also adapted
parts of its network, including rebuilding 90 bridges between London and the
Channel Tunnel, to allow the smooth passage of freight trains to the
continental network.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Suzuki reprieve for plant in Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Suzuki of Japan has dropped its threat to close its Spanish subsidiary, but
it will today tell workers that production will continue only if unions
agree to large job cuts.
The move marks a shift in Suzuki's former determination to wind up its
Santana Motor subsidiary in Linares, southern Spain, unless it received
financial support from the government.
Four-wheel drive vehicles are made at the plant, which employs 2,400
workers.
The Japanese group, which owns about 80 per cent of Santana, placed it in
receivership at the end of last month, saying it had accumulated losses of
Pta21bn (Pounds 101m) in the last three years.
The Industry Ministry said yesterday that Suzuki had agreed to remain
Santana's dominant shareholder 'for the time being' and had undertaken to
make a 'substantial' financial contribution to its balance sheet.
It is believed the Japanese parent company will write off a considerable
part of the estimated Pta16bn debt owed to it by Santana.
In exchange for keeping open the Linares plant, which accounts for virtually
the sole industrial activity in the area, Suzuki wants to cut the labour
force by as much as 50 per cent.
It is likely the Spanish administration will allocate emergency funds to
ease the labour shake-out.
The commitment given by Suzuki follows talks at the Industry Ministry last
week between Mr Yoshio Saito, the group's chairman who is also deputy
chairman of Santana, and senior ministry officials. Mr Saito was told that
the sudden closure of Santana would represent a serious political and social
problem for the government and that it would rebound badly on general
Japanese interests in Spain.
The decision to keep the Linares plant operating gives both Suzuki and the
administration a breathing space in which to search for another industrial
group willing to shoulder the Santana burden. A senior official in the
domestic vehicle sector said it was possible that a Korean car group could
eventually take the place of Suzuki in Linares.

FT  15 MAR 94 / UK softens stance on EU vote: Compromise on blocking vote
might prompt Tory backbench rebellion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The British government last night prepared the ground for a possible
compromise in a dispute over its power to block Brussels legislation.
Downing Street officials indicated ahead of today's meeting of European
Union foreign ministers in Brussels that Britain might not veto a proposal
to raise from 23 to 27 the number of votes needed to block legislation.
Britain wants to avoid being blamed for jeopardising the Community's
enlargement.
Without a compromise by Britain and Spain, who have been opposing the
proposal to increase the number of votes required to block decisions,
Sweden, Finland, Austria and Norway will be unable to join the EU by next
January.
European officials said British ministers had appeared to support a Spanish
proposal which would allow the blocking vote to rise to 27 once the new
members join the EU, while maintaining a further blocking vote at 23
provided a maximum of three countries made up the 23 votes.
That would keep the status quo intact and allow two large EU members and one
small one - with a combined population of at least 100m - to block decisions
by the EU Council of Ministers, possibly until an EU intergovernmental
conference in 1996 when voting weights could be renegotiated.
Agreement by Britain to compromise would allow successful negotiations on
the entry of Sweden, Finland and Austria to be approved by the European
Parliament and help smooth remaining obstacles to Norway's entry.
However, UK government business managers are worried about possible
backbench rebellions by Euro-sceptic Tory MPs and have warned ministers of
the difficulty of getting legislation through the House of Commons if they
agree to compromise. Their fears were highlighted last night when some
backbench MPs voiced their opposition to any compromise at a meeting of the
Conservative European Affairs committee.
At present, the blocking minority is 23 votes out of the total of 76,
distributed between the 12 members. After enlargement, with the entry of
Austria, Norway, Finland and Sweden, it is proposed that the blocking
minority would increase to 27 votes out of a new total of 90.
But as Mr John Major, the prime minister, last night met Mr Douglas Hurd,
foreign secretary, to finalise Britain's negotiating position, leading
Conservative Euro-sceptics said they would oppose any 'climbdown'. Mr
William Cash, one of the leading Euro-sceptics, said the Commons would not
put up with 'more erosion' of its powers.
Some Euro-sceptics said last night that they expected Mr Major to 'prevent
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office from making any compromise in the
interests of party unity'.
Faced with the choice of another dispute with its European partners or its
Euro-sceptics, Whitehall officials predicted the government would only pick
the latter if it was confident of limiting any backbench rebellion.
Mr Major's officials said he was determined to defend British interests in
an enlarged Community 'and get enlargement'.
The Foreign Office last night said it had not received any acceptable offer
over the size of the blocking veto, but underlined its commitment to
enlarging the union. Another official predicted that 'a compromise of some
sort will emerge'.
Senior British officials in Brussels signalled more than two weeks ago that
they could accept the Spanish formula, although, formally, they were
yesterday insisting there was no change in London's position.
Nevertheless, Spanish negotiators are depending on UK support, and any
likely compromise may take the form of a 'declaration' by the 12. Anything
more binding risks being turned down by the European Parliament.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Clintons' friend quits as Justice Department aide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Webster Hubbell, the US associate attorney-general and a close friend of
US president Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary, resigned yesterday after a
dispute with his former law firm.
He had been accused of overbilling clients at the Rose Law Firm in Little
Rock, Arkansas, where he and Mrs Clinton held partnerships.
'I believe . . . that the distractions on me at this time will interfere
with my service to the country and the president's agenda and that my family
. . . is being harmed,' he said in his resignation statement.
However, Mr Hubbell, number three at the Justice Department, has been linked
to the Whitewater affair, which involves the Clintons' financial dealings in
Arkansas in the 1980s. Mr Hubbell's father-in-law borrowed heavily from the
Madison Guaranty savings and loan institution at the centre of the
controversy, and failed to repay more than Dollars 500,000 (Pounds 335,000).
He did some work for federal thrift regulators, although Rose had once also
represented Madison Guaranty.
Another of the Clintons' friends, Mr Bernie Nussbaum, was forced to resign
as White House counsel earlier this month when it was revealed that he met
Treasury officials to discuss an investigation of Madison. A third of the
Clintons' friends, Mr Vince Foster, another White House lawyer, was found
dead last summer, in an apparent suicide.
Mr Hubbell's resignation comes just as the administration seemed to be
taking the offensive in the Whitewater affair. Mr Lloyd Cutler, the new
White House counsel, was co-operating closely with Mr Robert Fiske, the
special counsel investigating the Clintons' financial dealings and all
related issues.
Mr Hubbell, the subject of conservative attacks even before he took office,
was a golfing partner of the president. In Little Rock, where he had served
as mayor, he was seen as a reformer. He also headed the state lawyers'
association's ethics committee. He has denied any overbilling, and said he
was co-operating with a Rose internal probe.
Ms Janet Reno, US attorney-general, praised his work at the Justice
Department, saying he was 'a tireless crusader' who had worked to make the
department more accountable. Mr Clinton said he agreed with Mr Hubbell's
decision to quit, adding: 'It's the right thing to do.'
Mr Hubbell had been portrayed as the Justice Department's political fixer
for the White House. He had also come to symbolise the supposed cronyism of
the Clinton White House, with its numerous Arkansas operators out of their
depth in Washington.

A fire boat battles to control the blaze on board an oil tanker after the
Greek-Cypriot registered vessel collided with a coaster in the Bosporus. At

FT  15 MAR 94 / Emergency legislation to amend ruling on insolvency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is to bring in emergency retrospective legislation to reverse
an Appeal Court ruling which threatened tens of thousands of jobs at
companies in receivership or administration.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, told the House of
Commons yesterday that a bill would be introduced 'as a matter of urgency'
to remove uncertainty caused by the court ruling.
Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry,
said: 'If Mr Heseltine had not stepped in with the promise of immediate
legislation, hundreds more companies would have gone out of business, and
thousands of their workers would have lost their jobs.'
The statement follows two weeks of intensive lobbying by insolvency
practitioners, who had already begun to lay off staff at insolvent companies
rather than risk incurring additional employment costs.
Their action was triggered by a controversial ruling involving Paramount
Airways, the charter airline which is in administration under the 1986
Insolvency Act.
The court ruled that where administrators or receivers continue for more
than 14 days after their appointment to employ staff and pay them, they are
in effect liable for employees' holiday entitlements, pay in lieu of notice,
and other responsibilities under their existing contracts.
Under the new legislation, administrators and receivers will be able to
adopt restricted contracts of employment, excluding employment costs other
than wages, salaries and pension contributions. Other liabilities arising
from employees' original contracts will remain, but would be treated as an
unsecured claim against the company.
However, the legislation will do nothing to reduce the impact of the Appeal
Court's ruling on companies which are already in receivership or
administration, including Paramount itself. The creditors of the company met
yesterday. They are believed to have tentatively agreed to take their case
to the House of Lords, on condition that most of the legal costs are paid by
the insolvency profession.
Mr Heseltine said that the practice of administration had been 'placed in
jeopardy' by the court judgment, 'with all that that means for jobs,
commercial activity and business confidence'.
The bill will go through all its stages in both houses in 24 hours and will
take effect retrospectively from midnight last night
Administrators who are in the first two weeks of their appointment will
benefit from the new rules if they delay their acceptance of contracts until
today
Mr Mark Homan, president of the Society of Practitioners of Insolvency,
welcomed the new legislation but admitted that before clarification no new
payments would be made to the creditors to many companies already in
receivership or administration.
The government statement may be too late to save 140 jobs at Michael Mayes,
the insolvent Yorkshire textile manufacturer which was the first company
threatened with large-scale redundancies as a result of the Paramount
ruling.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Pounds 1.5bn outline rescue deal agreed for Euro Disney
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Walt Disney, the US entertainment group, has agreed terms for an outline
rescue deal worth about FFr13bn (Pounds 1.5bn) for Euro Disney, its troubled
European theme park subsidiary.
The deal, which could save Euro Disney from the threat of closure, involves
a FFr6bn rights issue and a five-year waiver of Disney's royalty
entitlements. It was agreed on Sunday evening after weeks of intricate
negotiations by the US group and a steering committee representing Euro
Disney's 63 banks.
The terms of the rescue were presented to Euro Disney's shareholders at an
annual general meeting yesterday in the Buffalo Bill wild west saloon at the
EuroDisneyland theme park near Paris. However, the steering committee needs
unanimous agreement from the other lenders to implement the deal, which
involves Euro Disney's debt being reduced from FFr20.3bn to FFr10bn and the
banks agreeing to an 18-month interest-rate holiday on their loans.
Mr Baudouin Prot of Banque Nationale de Paris, heading the banks' steering
committee for Euro Disney, said the plan, which was outlined to all 63
banks, was generally favourably received, but it would take some weeks for
every creditor to come to a considered judgment. The plan needs approval by
all creditors. Mr Prot said it was premature to speculate on what would
happen if any institution rejected it.
'Getting all the banks to agree will be the next big hurdle,' said one
negotiator.
Shares in Euro Disney, which faced closure without a rescue agreement, rose
sharply yesterday morning, but fell during the afternoon to close FFr2.90
lower at FFr33.85. In New York at the close Walt Disney's shares were down
Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 45 7/8 . The rescue plan's FFr6bn rights issue
involves the creation of 600m new shares at the par value of FFr10.0. Disney
will subscribe for its full 49 per cent stake. The issue will be
underwritten by a group of lenders, notably steering committee members. The
issue will dilute the stakes of existing shareholders 4.5 times by
increasing the number of Euro Disney shares from 170m to 770m.
Disney is injecting FFr1.4bn into Euro Disney by leasing two of the
EuroDisneyland rides. It will also waive for five years its entitlement to
fees and royalties worth about FFr450m annually. The interest payments
holiday should save another FFr800m a year.
Euro Disney, which lost FFr5.3bn in the financial year to September 30, said
it now hopes to break even in 1994/95.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Britain signals EU climbdown: Whips warn of possible
backbench rebellions from Euro-sceptics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The British government yesterday signalled that it was prepared to
compromise over its power to block Brussels legislation ahead of today's
meeting of European Union foreign ministers in Brussels.
Downing Street officials indicated that Britain may not veto a rise in the
number of votes needed to block legislation from 23 to 27 to prevent it
being blamed for jeopardising the Union's enlargement.
Agreement by Britain to compromise would allow successful negotiations on
the entry into the EU of Sweden, Finland and Austria to be approved by the
European Parliament and help smooth the few remaining obstacles to Norwegian
entry into the Union.
The signs of movement in London were welcomed by European Commission
officials in Brussels last night. Without a compromise by Britain and Spain,
who oppose increasing the number of votes required to block decisions by the
EU Council of Ministers, Sweden, Finland, Austria and Norway will be unable
to join the EU by next January.
However, government business managers are worried about possible backbench
rebellions by Euro-sceptic MPs and have warned ministers of the difficulty
of getting legislation through the House of Commons if they agree to
compromise.
At present the blocking minority is 23 votes out of the total of 76,
distributed between the 12 members. After enlargement, with the entry of
Austria, Norway, Finland and Sweden, it is proposed that the blocking
minority would increase to 27 votes out of a new total of 90.
But Britain may have been attracted by a Spanish proposal which would allow
the blocking vote to rise to 27 once the new members join the EU, while
maintaining a further blocking vote at 23 provided a maximum of three
countries made up the 23 votes.
That would keep the status quo intact and allow two large EU members and one
small one - with a combined population of at least 100m - to block
decisions, possibly until an EU intergovernmental conference in 1996 when
voting weights could be renegotiated.
But as Mr John Major last night met Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, to
finalise Britain's negotiating position, leading Conservative Euro-sceptics
said they would oppose any 'climbdown'. Mr William Cash, one of the leading
Euro-sceptics, said the Commons would not put up with 'more erosion' of its
powers.
However, faced with the choice of another dispute with its European partners
or its Euro-sceptics, Whitehall officials predicted the government would
pick the latter as long as it was confident of limiting any backbench
rebellion.
Mr John Major's officials said the prime minister was determined to defend
British interests 'in an enlarged Community and get enlargement'.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office last night said that it had not received
any acceptable offer over the size of the blocking veto, but underlined its
commitment to enlargement.
Another official predicted that 'a compromise of some sort will emerge'.
Senior British officials in Brussels signalled over two weeks ago that they
could live with the Spanish formula, although, formally, they were yesterday
insisting there was no change in London's position.
Nevertheless, Spanish negotiators are depending on UK support, and any
likely compromise may take the form of a 'declaration' by the 12. Anything
more binding risks being turned down by the European Parliament, which is
refusing to ratify the new members' accession treaty if the 12 make it too
easy for a minority of member states to block Euro-laws.

FT  15 MAR 94 / Clinton friend expected to quit as justice aide

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Webster Hubbell, the US associate attorney-general and a close friend of
US President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary, is expected to resign as
associate attorney general, Justice Department officials said yesterday.
Administration officials yesterday tied the likely resignation to questions
of overbilling by Mr Hubbell at the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, where he
and Mrs Clinton held partnerships.
However, Mr Hubbell, number three at the Justice Department, has also been
linked to the Whitewater affair, which involves the Clintons' financial
dealings in Arkansas in the 1980s. Mr Hubbell's father-in-law borrowed
heavily from the Madison Guaranty savings and loan institution at the centre
of the controversy, and failed to repay more than Dollars 500,0009 (Pounds
335,000). He did some work for federal thrift regulators, although Rose had
once also represented Madison Guaranty.
Another of the Clintons' friends, Mr Bernie Nussbaum, was forced to resign
as White House counsel earlier this month when it was revealed that he met
Treasury officials to discuss an investigation of Madison. A third of the
Clintons' friends, Mr Vince Foster, another White House lawyer, was found
dead last summer, in an apparent suicide.
Asked about the reports that Mr Hubbell was set to quit, Ms Dee Dee Myers,
White House press secretary, said: 'I'm not confirming it, but I'm not
denying it. The president knows the state of play.'
Mr Hubbell's likely resignation comes just as the administration seemed to
be taking the offensive in the Whitewater affair. Mr Lloyd Cutler, the new
but temporary White House counsel, was co-operating closely with Mr Robert
Fiske, the special counsel investigating the Clintons' financial dealings
and all related issues.
Mr Hubbell, the subject of conservative attacks even before he took office,
was a golfing partner of the president. In Little Rock, where he had served
as mayor, he was seen as a reformer who crusaded for open government. He
also headed the state lawyers association's ethics committee.
He has denied any overbilling, and said he was co-operating with a Rose
internal investigation into billing matters.
In Washington Mr Hubbell came under severe scrutiny from the Wall Street
Journal, which portrayed him as the Justice Department's political fixer for
the White House. For the administration's opponents he came to symbolise the
supposed cronyism of the Clinton White House, with its numerous Arkansas
operators out of their depth in Washington.

FT  15 MAR 94 / International Company News: IBCA lowers ratings on Banco
Central Hispano
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By OUR MADRID STAFF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Banco Central Hispano, one of Spain's leading banks, yesterday saw the IBCA
ratings for both its short term and long term debt downgraded.
The London-based agency said it was adjusting its rating for the bank's
short-term commercial paper from A1+ to A1 and for its long-term debt from
AA- to A+.
Bank officials said BCH was being 'excessively penalised' by the impact of
the crisis at Banco Espanol de Credito, for which the Bank of Spain is
mounting a rescue plan. However, they argued that the ratings change had
already been discounted by the market following last week's announcement by
Moody's that it was reviewing the bank for possible downgrade.
The move could affect plans by BCH to issue Dollars 200m of subordinated
debt.

Bongrain, one of France's largest cheese makers, yesterday announced net
profits of FFr434m (Dollars 76m) for 1993, an increase of 22.5 per cent over
the figure recorded in 1992.
The rise in profits, which included an exceptional gain of FFr145m, was
achieved on flat sales of FFr9.6bn.
Operating profits were also relatively stable, rising by just over 1 per
cent to FFr593m.
Bongrain said that the operating result was achieved despite a difficult
economic environment and without reducing long term investments.
It reflected the effectiveness of cost cutting and productivity measures,
according to the company. The group said that its strategy of expansion was
continued during the year, with acquisitions in Hungary and the Czech
republic.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia and the US yesterday acknowledged that the 'honeymoon' between them
was over and that they were fated to have disagreements. But they also
agreed to remain yoked in a partnership which, it was stressed, was one of
equals.
This emerged from a one-day meeting between Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian
foreign minister, and Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, in the
far eastern Russian port of Vladivostok.
The meeting came after Russia had expressed anger with what it saw as Nato's
failure to consult it about air strikes in Bosnia, differences over the
withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic states, and a growing swell of
opinion in the US that the attempts of the two countries to forge a close
partnership is - in the words of Mr Zbigniew Brzezinski, the former US
national security adviser - 'premature'.
Mr Kozyrev said after the talks that Russia and the US were building a
'mature relationship' of equals which would survive differences.
Mr Christopher said that 'we recognise that as large nations with large
interests we are bound to have differences, but we pledge to deal with our
differences openly'.
According to the Rusian Information Agency, Mr Kozyrev said Russia wanted a
rapid withdrawal of its troops from the Baltic states, but 'this will happen
only if we agree on a civilised exit (of the troops) and as long as the
deportation of the miliary pensioners is stopped'.
The Baltic states, especially Estonia, have protested against Russia linking
the withdrawal of the troops - set to be completed by the end of August -
with other demands, a stance which has been supported by the main western
countries.
Mr Christopher said that Russia welcomed the implementation of the
'Partnership for Peace' accord, under which central and east European
states, including Russia, could become more closely associated with Nato,
short of full membership. However, in a recent article in the daily
Izvestia, Mr Kozyrev had said that 'the Partnership for Peace is not to be
thought of as the summit of creation' and that the Nato act in ignoring
Russian interests in Bosnia showed that it remained an organisation which
excluded Russia.
Mr Pavel Grachev, Russia's defence minister, has postponed a trip and
remained in Moscow to ensure reliable control of Russia's nuclear forces
while President Boris Yeltsin is on leave, the Defence Ministry said
yesterday. Mr Yeltsin earlier in the day left for an unannounced holiday by
the Black Sea.

Gen Rose and other UN officials inspected airport facilities in advance of a
planned airlift of humanitarian supplies to Tuzla, which is surrounded by
Serb forces. The airport has been closed since May 1992, when Serb artillery
fire damaged runways. Following talks in Moscow earlier this month, the
Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, said his forces would allow the
airport to reopen. No date has been set.
Bosnian Moslem and Croat authorities allowed families long divided by war to

FT  14 MAR 94 / Apple launches assault on Intel: IBM and Motorola's chips
pose a real challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Apple Computer's introduction today of Macintosh computers based on a new
PowerPC microprocessor chip will kick off a high stakes technology battle in
the personal computer industry.
Apple and its PowerPC allies, International Business Machines and Motorola,
aim to end the hegemony of Intel, the world's largest chip maker, which last
year supplied about 80 per cent of the microprocessor chips used in PCs and
recorded Dollars 2.3bn (Pounds 1.6bn) in net profits, more than the rest of
the top 10 US semiconductor manufacturers combined.
The PowerPC, manufactured by Motorola and IBM, is the first credible
challenger to Intel's dominant microprocessors in over a decade. Based on
IBM Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) technology, it is faster,
smaller and cheaper than the current version of Intel's top-of-the-line
Pentium chip.
For IBM, PowerPC represents a chance to grab a bigger share of the profits
to be made in the desktop computer business, and to be less dependent upon
Intel. The new chip refreshes Motorola's fading microprocessor technology
and gives the performance of Apple's Macintosh a much needed boost.
Microsoft, the leading PC software company, cannot lose. Whatever the
outcome of the technology battle, it is likely to remain the biggest
software supplier.
Motorola and IBM are drumming up support for PowerPC among computer
manufacturers to establish it as a new industry standard. IBM is expected to
launch its own range of PowerPC personal computers later this year.
Apple's 'Power Macintosh' will, however, be the critical market test of the
new technology. Apple today will introduce three new models, ranging in
price from Dollars 1,819 to Dollars 5,309 and aimed at business users. Over
the next three years, Apple plans to replace all its products with PowerPC
versions.
Apple's prices are aggressive, undercutting the well-known PC brands such as
Compaq and Dell using Intel Pentium chips. However, the Intel camp has a
huge advantage in the vast selection of software applications available for
its PCs.
Apple says that 150 independent software developers are committed to
designing Power Macintosh applications over the next few months. Yet
computer buyers visiting stores this week are unlikely to find any Power
Macintosh programs. Early purchasers of the new computers will have to use
software designed for Apple's established Macintosh computers, or for
Microsoft's Windows operating system.
When forced to mimic other computers, the PowerPC slows down significantly,
to the speed of a low-end Intel chip or one of the older Motorola chips used
by Apple. With its performance advantage stifled, the Power Macintosh
becomes a less compelling product.
For Apple, the introduction of 'Power Macintosh' also represents a tricky
product transition. Apple has followed the 'conventional wisdom' by offering
Power Macintosh to business users first. Home buyers, it believes, will be
satisfied with slower Macintosh models. Only toward the end of its planned
three-year transition to PowerPC does Apple plan to offer such high
performance in consumer products.
However, sales of existing Macintosh products to business users have slowed
in the past couple of months, Mr Ian Diery, Apple's executive
vice-president, acknowledges. Consumer sales are currently growing faster.
Almost half of all PCs sold last year went to home users - whether for
personal or home office use.
Meanwhile, Intel is accelerating the pace of its microprocessor technology
development in a bid to speed away from the PowerPC and mounting competition
from other chip makers that 'clone' its chips. Last month Intel slashed its
prices. Earlier this week, the chip maker announced new versions of its
Pentium microprocessor that outperform the PowerPC chips used by Apple.
While it may be several months before PCs with the new chips come to market,
Intel is already working on its next generation of microprocessors,
code-named P6, which are expected early next year.
Even by combining their efforts, IBM and Motorola will be hard pressed to
keep up with Intel's Dollars 1.1bn 1994 product development budget and the
Dollars 2.4bn that it plans to spend on new plants and equipment.
Last year Intel shipped more than 30m microprocessors to PC manufacturers.
In comparison, Apple's goal of selling one million Power Macintosh computers
over the next 12 months seems quite modest.
Yet Intel is keenly aware that PowerPC could pose a real threat if it gains
market momentum. IBM's introduction of PowerPC computers later this year
will place Intel in the awkward position of competing with its largest
customer.
Unlike Apple, IBM does not plan to replace its current personal computer
products with PowerPC computers. Instead, it has formed a new division that
will effectively compete with its own Intel-based PCs.
For Intel, therefore, the challenge is to minimise the impact of PowerPC in
the personal computer market until IBM sorts out its priorities. This makes
Apple, as the advanced guard of the PowerPC, a target of Intel's notoriously
tough competitive tactics. Ready or not, Apple may be in for the fight of
its life.

scrutiny - Other companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Reed Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch publishing group, will announce on Thursday
its first full-year results since the merger. Analysts are forecasting
pre-tax profits of around Pounds 530m (Dollars 773.8m). Mr Derek Terrington,
media analyst at Kleinwort Benson, says that as well as a pre-tax figure of
Pounds 530m - Pounds 280m for Reed's share - he will be looking for further
evidence that the merger is producing benefits. Ms Lorna Tilbian of SG
Warburg is looking for Pounds 535m - Pounds 283m accounted for by Reed.
During the year the group finally took over Official Airline Guides, sold
its stake in British Sky Broadcasting and expanded into legal publishing in
France and Italy. More small-to-medium 'filling in' acquisitions are now
expected to add to Reed Elsevier's professional and specialist publishing
activities.

FT  14 MAR 94 / UK may use army at airports: Flight delays after third
mortar attack on Heathrow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL and DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government is this week expected to consider using army patrols to
boost security at British airports after the third Irish Republican Army
mortar attack at Heathrow in five days.
Both Heathrow and Gatwick airports were closed for several hours last night
after coded warnings. Scotland Yard later described the warnings as a
'cynical ploy by the IRA to cause unnecessary confusion and fear amongst the
public'.
Meanwhile army personnel and equipment helped search Heathrow for further
devices following yesterday's attack in which four mortars, fired from a
heavily camouflaged launcher, failed to explode.
One hit the roof of Terminal Four,which was closed for eight hours, causing
delays to flights and diversions. The IRA's ability to embarrass the
security forces and cause severe disruption for travellers will today bring
renewed calls at Westminster for tighter security.
The government, however, will be anxious to prevent the IRA using the
introduction of army patrols as a propaganda coup. It is also aware that
tighter security measures in one location may only switch IRA attacks
elsewhere.
Ministers could meet as early as today to decide whether to approve a
high-profile army presence at airports to help deter further attacks.
Downing Street said last night that Mr John Major, the prime minister, was
in close touch with events and any requests from the police for the army's
help would be considered.
Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, last night accused Sinn Fein and the
IRA of showing 'utter contempt' for the peace process. He believed the
mortar attacks had turned Sinn Fein's internal discussions on the peace
process into a 'bizarre charade' and said people viewed with growing dismay
the prospects for an early end to violence.
Last night the IRA accused police of gambling with lives and claimed their
warnings were deliberately ignored. 'The luck of the British authorities who
are deliberately taking these calculated and cynical gambles with people's
lives will inevitably run out,' it said.
London hotels fear the IRA attacks will lead to cancellations by businessmen
and tourists this summer - particularly US visitors. 'It is almost
inevitable that this sort of thing leads to cancellations by Americans,'
said an official at London's Hilton Hotel. But in the US, business people
leaving New York for London said they thought it would have little immediate
effect.
One businessman boarding yesterday afternoon's Concorde flight to London
said: 'My sense is that incidents like this simply lead to tighter security,
so it all balances out. My main concern is that the extra security will
increase delays.'
The IRA action is also likely to bring Dublin under more pressure from
British ministers to improve cross-border co-operation in combating
terrorism. The issue is already high on the Anglo-Irish agenda.
In Dublin, a government spokesman said the intention was to maintain and
increase whenever possible security co-operation between the two countries.

FT  14 MAR 94 / G7 summit squares up to jobs crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Finance and employment ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial
nations gathered in Detroit last night for a two-day brainstorming session
on tackling the unemployment that besets their economies.
Although US officials insist there will be no final communique or any
attempt at formal policy co-ordination, President Bill Clinton wants to use
the conference conclusions as the basis for the July G7 summit in Naples to
agree on a jobs plan.
For Mr Clinton, who will open the conference this morning, the meeting
provides an opportunity to focus on themes central to his administration's
programme, after weeks of being dogged by the Whitewater affair. The
ramifications of Mr Clinton's investment in this Arkansas property venture
in the 1980s brought about the resignation a week ago of Mr Bernard
Nussbaum, the White House counsel, and on Friday dragged White House and
Treasury officials before a grand jury for questioning.
Ministers from other G7 countries expect the Detroit meeting to agree on the
need for labour market flexibility, education and training investment, and
open trade.
Mr Larry Summers, US Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, says
the employment issue is critically important for all G7 countries.
'If you asked on what criteria these democratically elected governments were
going to be judged by their electorates, the answer was jobs. If they don't
succeed in achieving that, they are very unlikely to achieve whatever else
they want to achieve,' Mr Summers said last week.
But the seven nations are not unanimous on how big a role economic stimulus,
through lower interest rates or tax cuts, should play in jobs policy.
US officials do not want to turn the Detroit meeting into a shouting match
with Germany's Bundesbank, but they continue to argue that Europe needs
further interest rate cuts to spur growth and job creation.
Ms Laura Tyson, the chief White House economist, says she is yet to be
convinced that Europe's unemployment problems are as much explained by
structural problems, such as rigid labour market rules, as her European
counterparts argue.
'Between 1986 and 1990 the European G7 countries added about 5m jobs and the
unemployment rate went down from about 9 per cent to about 6.9 per cent.
Since 1990 the unemployment rate has gone up to about 9.2 per cent and the
level of employment has gone down by about 2m,' said Ms Tyson.
'Unless you are willing to make the case that structural rigidities improved
a lot between 1986 and 1990 and then got worse again, a lot of that
deterioration has to be cyclical.'
With Whitewater still dominating conversation in Washington, Mr Lloyd
Cutler, the veteran lawyer brought in as the new White House counsel to help
clean up the mess, yesterday promised 'a good deal of disclosure'. But he
said he thought the investigation would uncover little in the way of
wrongdoing.

<DATELINE>
   MARSEILLES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bernard Tapie, the politician and owner of Olympique-Marseille football
club, has been questioned by police about the murder of a
corruption-fighting woman MP, investigators said yesterday, Reuter reports
from Marseilles.
He had been named by Mrs Yann Piat, who was shot on February 25, in a letter
to an aide in which she said she feared assassination.
Mr Tapie was not immediately available for comment but last week he denied
any connection, telling French television: 'What now? Why don't you accuse
me of being responsible for the war in Bosnia?'
The investigating judge has placed two minor Toulon underworld figures under
investigation for suspected murder but made clear he believes there was a
wider conspiracy, possibly including politicians.
Police have also de-tained four other people with underworld links for
questioning in the investigation.
Mrs Piat, who began her political career in the extreme-right National Front
before switching to the Union for French Democracy (UDF), earned a
reputation for denouncing alleged links between organised crime, property
speculation and politics on the French Riviera.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Cell phone pact lifts US threat against Tokyo

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan has narrowly averted US trade sanctions over its treatment of
Motorola, a leading US cellular phone company.
A deal was reached after intense negotiations, which removes the immediate
threat of sanctions against Japan over US access to its cellular phone
market. But it could create an unfortunate precedent by encouraging the
Japanese government to become closely involved in the affairs of private
companies.
Washington, which used the case to signal its dissatisfaction with Tokyo's
progress in opening its markets, was due this week to publish a list of
likely targets for sanctions. The US wanted to put pressure on Japan to
accept quantifiable indicators of the openness of its markets.
Last month Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, brandished a Motorola
cellphone as he announced the US finding that Japan had breached a bilateral
agreement.
The agreement calls on the Japanese government to monitor investment by a
Japanese group, IDO, in a cellular phone system promoted by Motorola. The
government should also allocate more radio frequency to the US system. IDO,
the Japanese cellular phone operator, agreed to quicken the pace of its
investment in Motorola's system.
The Japanese government also agreed to monitor IDO's progress in
implementing its plans at three-monthly intervals; to back low-interest
loans from the Japan Development Bank; to allow IDO to carry out its
investment and to review the situation at any time if there was a request
from either party.
In a weekend radio programme, President Bill Clinton welcomed the
breakthrough.
However, Japanese officials, who have emphasised the importance of
deregulating domestic industry, said that such a deal was only possible in a
sector where bureaucratic involvement was still strong because of the need
to allocate frequencies.
Japan's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications had sought initially to
leave the dispute in the hands of the two companies.
However, US pressure, and the threat of sanctions at a time when US-Japanese
relations have been fraught with difficulty, forced Tokyo to concede.
The deal calls for IDO to bring forward its investment in a further 159 base
stations for the Tacs cellular phones system which is backed by Motorola,
and complete that investment by the early autumn of 1995. IDO also agreed to
reallocate some of its radio frequency used for a Japanese rival to
Motorola's system.
The US had threatened sanctions against Japan on the grounds that a
bilateral agreement to provide the US system with 'comparable market access'
had not been met.

FT  14 MAR 94 / SPD set to win Lower Saxony: Christian Democrats slip to
worst result in state election for 35 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN and QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's opposition Social Democratic party (SPD) was coasting to a clear
victory in the state election in Lower Saxony last night, with Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union slipping to its worst result in the
state since 1959.
Lower Saxony's vote is seen as a key indicator of Chancellor Kohl's
prospects in 19 elections this year, which culminate with the general
election on October 16. That will be preceded by 16 state and local
authority elections, an electoral assembly for federal president in May and
European elections in June.
The vote yesterday confirms the uphill struggle Mr Kohl faces if he is to
win re-election, even though the SPD has yet to gain a decisive lead at a
national level.
Exit polls on German television predicted the SPD would win more than 44 per
cent in Germany's fourth most populous state. The CDU was forecast to win up
to 36.5 per cent.
Mr Gerhard Schroder, SPD premier, expressed confidence that he would win an
absolute majority in the Hanover-based Lower Saxony state parliament and be
able to rule without his coalition partner, the Green party.
Mr Jurgen Trittin, the leading Green party minister in the outgoing
SPD-Green coalition in Hanover, said: 'This is the day the 'twilight of the
chancellor' began in Bonn.'
Yet the result amounts to less of a setback for Mr Kohl than had been feared
by some party members. It may be less of a victory for the Social Democrats,
who seemed unlikely to improve on the vote won in Lower Saxony in 1990,
despite the Bonn government's obvious unpopularity.
The CDU did far worse in both previous local elections - in Hamburg last
September, when it fell to 25 per cent support, and Brandenburg in December,
when it barely won 20 per cent and fell to third place behind the former
Democratic Socialist party (PDS), the former Communists.
The exit polls also suggest that protest parties, including the extreme
rightwing Republicans, the non-party Statt Partei, and the now relatively
well-established Greens, have not risen to the extent predicted by some
political observers.
The Green party, which has been in coalition with the SPD since the last
elections in 1990, was likely to win up to 7.5 per cent, a small improvement
on the 5.5 per cent it won in the 1990 election.
The Free Democratic party (FDP), Chancellor Kohl's partners in the Bonn
coalition, appear to have slipped a little from 6 per cent last time, and
may fail to reach the 5 per cent minimum needed to win seats in the state
parliament.
The Republicans were likely to win at most 4 per cent, according to the exit
poll conducted by ZDF television. The Statt Partei, which caused a small
sensation when it won more than 6 per cent in Hamburg last year, was
forecast to get no more than 1.5 per cent this time.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Rev Susan Shipp (above), one of the first woman priests ordained by the
Church of England, celebrated communion yesterday in Bristol, as groups
opposed to their ordination warned of further splits in the church.
Thirty-three women were ordained on Saturday by the bishop of Bristol, the
Rt Rev Barry Rogerson.
The Vatican warned of a 'profound obstacle' to reunion hopes between the
Catholic church and the Anglican communion. But Rt Rev Mark Santer, bishop
of Birmingham, said he hoped traditionalists tempted to become Roman
Catholics would find it possible to stay.
One UK government minister has already converted to Catholicism over the
issue, and another has announced his intention to do so. A claim by the
latter, environment secretary John Gummer, that the Church of England had
turned itself into a 'sect' by accepting women priests was dismissed as
'incredibly insular'. by the bishop of Birmingham. Many other branches of
the Anglican church around the world already have women priests.

14 MONDAY
G7 targets unemployment
Finance and employment ministers from the G7 top industrial nations are
joined in Detroit by European Union social affairs commissioner Padraig Flyn
for a jobs summit. The gathering, called by US president Bill Clinton, is
the first of its kind specifically to address employment issues. The US is
likely to press European countries to cut interest rates.
US-Russian relations: Warren Christopher, US secretary of state at the end
of his 10-day Asian trip, meets Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, in
Vladivostock.
They are likely to discuss Bosnia and the timetable of Russian troop
withdrawals from Latvia and Estonia, as well as co-operation in peacemaking
efforts in the Middle East and fall-out from the recent arrest of an alleged
Russian spy in the CIA.
World environment: Negotiations on the restructuring and replenishment of
the Global Environment Facility will resume in Geneva (to Mar 16). The
objective is to tie up the Dollars 2bn replenishment package and set up the
Facility as the financial mechanism for administering the 1992 global
environmental conventions.
European transport: The Second Pan-European Transport Conference, organised
by the European Parliament and the European Commission, takes place on
Crete, Greece. It will explore ways to develop a pan-European transport
network, involving the many new countries that have emerged since the first
conference in 1991.
Euro Disney, the hard-pressed theme park near Paris, holds its annual
general meeting, which is expected to be stormy. Its shares stand at a third
of their value a year ago.
India's prime minister, PV Narasimha Rao, on an official visit to Britain,
meets Prime Minister John Major and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd in
Downing Street. Talks will focus on the improving relations between the two
countries, Indian economic reform and British investment in India. India's
dispute over Kashmir with neighbouring Pakistan will also be aired.
Commonwealth Day: The Queen starts the Commonwealth Games Relay Message from
Buckingham Palace then attends Commonwealth Day Observance at Westminster
Abbey.
Holidays: Much of the Moslem world celebrates the two-day festival of Eid
al-Fitr.
15 TUESDAY
EU enlargement crisis
European Union foreign ministers hold an emergency meeting in Brussels to
discuss the enlargement crisis. The ostensible purpose is to try to hammer
out an agreement on Norwegian entry to the Union, mainly a matter of
settling fish quotas. However, the issue of admitting the four Efta
applicants has raised the contentious question of the distribution of power
in an enlarged Union.
The dispute centres on national veto rights. While most member-states
support a rise in the blocking minority in the council of ministers from 23
population-weighted votes out of 76 to 27 out of 90, the UK, backed by
Spain, is opposing this move. The whole process of enlargement is at risk.
US producer prices index: Markets will be watching this indicator - and
Wednesday's consumer prices index - for signs of inflationary pressures. If
the figures turn out higher than the consensus forecasts, they will trigger
fears that the Federal Reserve may increase interest rates again.
Romania's government has said it will introduce a new minimum wage of
Lei58,000 (USDollars 37) a month from today, well below the Lei78,000-92,000
(USDollars 50-59) demanded by trade unions. The unions are threatening
further strike action if the government fails to come up with a better
offer.
Waste at sea: Japan, Russia and South Korea are to begin a survey on the
effects of nuclear waste dumped in the Sea of Japan.
Finland's prime minister Esko Aho begins a two-day visit to Estonia, where
he will hold talks with his opposite number Mart Laar.
Illinois primaries:
Illinois holds gubernatorial and congressional primaries. National attention
has been focused on the struggles of Democratic representative Dan
Rostenkowski (left) to win a further term, while undergoing a federal ethics
investigation.
World Aviation, Education and Safety congress opens in Bombay (to Mar 18).
Italian elections: The Pope is to pray for Italy ahead of next week's
general elections.
Norway's National Gallery has been given until today to ransom the stolen
painting The Scream by Edvard Munch. Following its theft last month, a
demand for Dollars 1m has been received.
16 WEDNESDAY
UK economy in focus
Figures for UK unemployment in February are expected to show a fall, after
the surprise 15,500 rise in January. Analysts predict a seasonally adjusted
drop of around 20,000. A further rise would prompt serious doubts about the
health of the UK recovery.
With April's tax increases looming on the horizon, the markets will also pay
close attention to data on February's retail sales for evidence of consumer
confidence. The consensus is for a 0.2 per cent month-on-month increase,
making the annual rise 3.1 per cent, but recent retail sales data have shown
a tendency to surprise.
Thatcher in Brazil:
Lady Thatcher, the former British prime minister begins a visit to Brazil as
guest of Banco Garantia (to Mar 19). Her trip is sandwiched between the
recent tour of bankers and industrialists led by Michael Portillo, chief
secretary to the treasury, and the arrival of Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign
minister, in April.
British exports to Brazil nearly doubled last year. Lady Thatcher will be
preaching the virtues of privatisation.
Thailand's prime minister Chuan Leekpai begins an official visit to Vietnam
(to Mar 19). Vietnam's expressed desire to join the Association of South
East Asian Nations will be on the agenda, ahead of a meeting of Asean
foreign ministers in Bangkok, the Thai capital, in July.
Stena Line, part of Sweden's diversified Stena Group, holds an extraordinary
general meeting in Gothenburg to secure the go-ahead for a rights issue to
finance two ferries.
CeBIT, Europe's largest computer and communications show, opens in Hanover.
The exhibition fills every hall in Hanover's vast showgrounds and is
depicted as a shop window for European information technology. A traditional
launching pad for new products, this year the list includes Texas
Instrument's superfast multimedia chip, partly designed in the company's UK
laboratories.
FT Survey: Information and Communications Technology.
Football: European Cup Champions' league group matches. In Group A,
Barcelona (Spain) play Spartak Moscow (Russia) and Galatasaray (Turkey) play
Monaco (France). In Group B, Werder Bremen (Germany) plays AC Milan (Italy)
and FC Porto (Portugal) plays Anderlecht (Belgium).
Holidays: Indonesia and Malaysia (markets closed).
17 THURSDAY
Partners in peace
US defence secretary William Perry starts a trip to Russia, Kazakhstan,
Ukraine and Belarus. He will discuss military and other ties with the former
Soviet republics.
The proposed links are to include regular meetings between military and
defence officials, training with the US armed forces, and technical
assistance.
Bundesbank meeting: The policy-making council of the German central bank
holds its regular fortnightly meeting, amid regular speculation as to
whether it will reduce
interest rates again.
Sky wars: US transport secretary Federico Pena is due to say whether he will
approve extension of a 'code-sharing' arrangement between the UK's British
Airways and USAir. Under the code-sharing deal, which lapses today, the two
airlines market each other's flights under the same ticketing code, making
it easier for them to feed passengers to each other.
The Clinton administration is threatening to scrap the agreement unless US
airlines secure greater access to British airports, especially Heathrow.
Macedonia's president, Kiro Gligorov, holds talks in Bonn with German
foreign minister Klaus Kinkel. President Gligorov will be hoping for Germany
to put pressure on Greece to scrap its embargo on the fledgling former
Yugoslav republic. Last week, Greece allowed a train of fuel tanker trucks
to cross into its neighbour.
French protest: Unions have called a national protest against plans to allow
employers to take on the young unemployed at 80 per cent of the minimum
wage. A quarter of those under 25 are out of work.
Wartime collaborator Paul Touvier goes on trial in Versailles, France, on
charges of crimes against humanity for picking Jewish hostages for execution
by the Nazis during the second world war.
St Patrick's Day:
Holiday in all parts of Ireland in honour of the patron saint. In London,
the Queen Mother presents shamrock to Irish Guards. In the US, Irish premier
Albert Reynolds is guest of honour at a dinner given by President Bill
Clinton at the White House.
Cricket: Second test match between England and the West Indies begins in
Georgetown, Guyana (to Mar 22). Also, the second test between South Africa
and Australia begins in Cape Town (to March 21).
The Tote Gold Cup, one of the leading events of Britain's National Hunt
horse-racing season, is run at Cheltenham.
18 FRIDAY
Apec gathering in Honolulu
Finance ministers of the member countries of the Asia Pacific Economic
Co-operation forum meet in Honolulu. The gathering is modelled after the
regular meetings of finance ministers of the G7 industrial countries.
John Hume, a member of the British Parliament from Northern Ireland, is to
address the US National Press Club in Washington.
Cuba in focus: Anticipating the New Cuba, a conference sponsored by the
World Economic Development Congress, begins in New York.
Spain's ruling socialist workers' party begins its 33rd congress (to Mar
20). Against a background of recession, high unemployment and falling
popularity, the differences between the pragmatic, market-orientated
government and leftwing elements in the unions may come to the fore.
Science week: Britain begins a National Week of Science, Engineering and
Technology. It is intended as a 'celebration and an illumination of science
and technology'.
FT Surveys: Poland, Scotland
19-20 WEEKEND

Monday: February's producer price figures in the UK will be scanned for
signs of inflationary pressures. Although the month-on-month increase is
likely to be 0.3 per cent, the annual rise is expected to drop to 3.5 per
cent from January's 3.7 per cent.
Tuesday: The Confederation of British Industry's distributive trades survey
will be a prelude to the following day's retail sales figures. The two do
not always show the same picture; last month, the CBI said the balance of
retailers reporting an increase in sales was the lowest for 12 months, while
retail sales rose 0.6 per cent.
Wednesday: UK average earnings figures, published alongside the unemployment
statistics, are expected to show an increase in the year to January of 3 per
cent. It has remained at this rate for several months. The public sector
borrowing requirement is normally large at the end of the tax year.
February's total is expected to be Pounds 6.7bn, but the total for the
financial year is still expected to undershoot the forecast Pounds 50bn.
Friday: February's sterling M4 lending may have picked up to Pounds 1.8bn,
from January's extremely low Pounds 100m.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Equity Markets: Learning lessons from failed hedging
strategies - Risk and Reward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Here's a test for all budding risk managers. Your company has a problem. It
has been very ambitious in developing sales of its main products, which are
all oil-based. Delivery commitments under fixed price contracts run as much
as 10 years into the future. If the price of oil goes up, your company will
suffer.
Your predecessor as risk manager thought he had the answer. He bought
futures and swaps to match the sales commitments, barrel for barrel. A good
hedge? The problem is, there is liquidity only in short-term oil derivative
contracts. So he placed all the hedges in short-term instruments.
You can guess what happened next: oil prices plunged. With a position of
around 160m barrels in the derivatives markets, this led to some pretty big
margin calls. In fact, the cash calls ran into hundreds of millions of
dollars, banks had to be persuaded to save the company from bankruptcy, the
chief executive was sacked.
This is where you come in. A new management has inherited the mess, and
wants you to sort it out.
No prizes for guessing that this is Metallgesellschaft. The company sacked
Mr Arthur Benson, the person it blamed for the mess. It replaced him with Ms
Nancy Kropp, an oil trader with a history of fire-fighting (she had helped
Deutsche Bank, MG's main banker, with a similar - though lesser - disaster
at German company Kloekner in the 1980s.)
The first option facing you, as the new risk manager, is simply to do
nothing. In your heart, perhaps, you think the oil price won't fall much
further.
The company has already taken the pain of meeting the margin calls. Also, if
the oil price stays low, the future profits on contracts with customers will
eventually match the derivatives losses. It will all come out in the wash.
This was certainly the view of some derivatives experts when the MG problem
blew up last December.
The second option is to keep the existing positions, and buy another big
hedge. This was Mr Benson's preferred route. His solution: buy a huge put
option, to protect the company from any further fall in the oil price.
This, in the view of the new management, was akin to shutting the stable
door after the horse had bolted.
The third option is to shrink both sides of the book: end some of the
delivery contracts with customers and sell the matching 'hedges,'
drastically reducing the company's positions. This is the route chosen by Ms
Kropp.
Mr Benson, who is suing MG and Deutsche Bank, claims her approach has led to
real losses, rather than just the paper losses incurred under his strategy.
She sold at the very bottom of the market, he says.
Ms Kropp's decision appears to have been based largely on the impracticality
of running such a vast derivatives book.
According to one person familiar with the new MG hedging strategy, rolling
over the short-term hedges was causing losses (real, not paper) of Dollars
50m a month: MG comprised such a large part of the market that nothing it
did was invisible.
As it lumbered forward, it was prey to other traders. 'The position was
self-defeating. With such a large position, you become the market. The whole
market was watching.'
The right answer? Who knows. MG is not about to reveal details of its
remaining positions, or the cost of the partial liquidation.
There is one clear lesson from all of this, though: hedging strategies that
look fine on paper often don't work in practice, particularly when they
involve handling large volumes in thinly-traded markets.

FRANKFURT
Thursday sees the last Bundesbank council meeting for a month. UBS says that
after the welter of comments from the Bundesbank about the demotion of M3,
it would seem that we are now in for a period of further cuts in repo rates,
but in small steps, even with further progress in the wage round. UBS,
however, does not expect any further cut in the discount rate until the end
of April.
Consensus estimates are for a 35 per cent fall in profits from BASF on
Thursday and a 9 per cent decline from Bayer on Friday.
Schering is today expected to report a slight increase in sales for the
start of 1994, but investors will be more interested to hear what the
company has to say about the outlook for sales of its Betaseron multiple
sclerosis treatment in the US.
AMSTERDAM
Ahold, the Netherlands' largest retailer and one of the top 10 largest food
retailers in the US through ownership of four chains, reports on Thursday
and consensus estimates are for a 13 per cent rise in 1993 net profit. Hoare
Govett says the company will be one of the major beneficiaries of dollar
strength while the scope for recovery in earnings at FNS East (now renamed
Edwards) and at Finast Ohio is significant.
PARIS
LVMH, the world's largest luxury goods group, reports on Thursday, and
forecasts are for a 5 - 10 per cent decline in full-year net profit. BSN is
seen posting a 5 per cent decline in 1993 net profit on the same day.
Pinault-Printemps, the retail group which has triggered protests from
minority investors with its all-share offer for full control of La Redoute,
its mail order subsidiary, reports on Friday. Consensus estimates are for a
13 per cent decline in net profits.
MILAN
Parmalat, the diary products group whose shares slid at the end of last week
after it said it would seek a mandate from shareholders to raise up to
L500bn over the next five years through bonds and warrants, is in Edinburgh
today and London tomorrow with presentations to analysts .
TOKYO
Volatility may increase as more companies announce downward revisions of
earnings forecasts for the year to the end of March.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Equity Markets: Investors optimistic on inflation - New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In recent weeks, long-term US interest rates have climbed rapidly amid
growing concerns about resurgent inflation and the concerns have spread to
the stock market, where prices have struggled to make headway in spite of
mostly bullish news on the economy.
This week, the stock market will have the opportunity to judge for itself
whether inflation is really on the rise again, and some good news should
allow stocks to shake off their inflation fears.
Tomorrow, the February producer prices index is released, and a day later,
the consumer prices index is published. Although analysts expect the two
indices to show slightly stronger growth than in January (the brokerage
house Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette forecasts that both the PPI and CPI rose
by 0.4 per cent last month), the inflation alarm bell is likely to stop
ringing.
If analysts' forecasts prove correct, the annual consumer inflation rate
will measure close to 2.4 per cent. That is a full point below the
comparable rate recorded at the same stage of 1993, a remarkable reduction
considering the economy over the past two months has been growing at a
significantly faster pace than in the same period a year ago.
A hint of how the markets are likely to respond to favourable inflation
reports came last Friday, when after a poor start, share prices rose
steadily on the back of declining bond yields. Stocks firmed on Friday as
investors turned more optimistic about this week's inflation data. Above
all, they were able to take a step back from some of the economic, and
political, analysis that disrupted trading earlier in the week.
Yet, even if the inflation picture brightens, political problems that have
unsettled investors recently are unlikely to fade into the background
especially quickly. Most of Wall Street agreed by the end of last week that
the fuss the bond market, and later the stock market, made over rumours
swirling around the Whitewater affair was overdone, but the White House is
unlikely to emerge from the clouds of the 'scandal' particularly soon.
As long as the perception holds that President Clinton is politically
hampered by the growing inquiry into Whitewater, and by press revelations of
a possible cover-up, then it is of concern to investors.
Why? While that is not easy to answer, it is often said that if the
President gets into deeper trouble, so does his political agenda, which
includes such a market-sensitive programmes as healthcare and welfare
reform.
Politics aside, the stock market's immediate future depends on what happens
next to long-term interest rates. The yield on the 30-year government bond
has leapt more than 100 basis points, to 6.9 per cent, since October. While
the yield may edge a bit higher from here, bond investors may soon realise
the Treasury market correction has gone far enough. This scenario would give
the stock market some much-needed breathing room, and allow investors to
digest the events of the past few weeks in a more considered fashion.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Equity Markets: Signs that confidence is recovering - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The stock market is trying hard to revert to its traditional role as a
measure of performance of Great Britain plc, but the process is not proving
easy. Bond markets, both in Europe and the US, are still capable of throwing
UK equities back on their heels and are likely to present fresh challenges
this week.
The problem appears to be one of general nervousness rather than simply of
interest rate prospects, or what the Bundesbank or the Federal Reserve may
or may not do. For equities, the warning is that any tremor in the bond
markets can still wipe out the fragile recovery of confidence in the stock
market.
But there are clear signs that confidence is recovering as the flow of
company results and, more importantly, of dividend statements, indicates
that economic recovery is making itself felt.
There have been increased dividends from the banking sector, and from Glaxo
and HSBC, two of the biggest companies in the market. Last week's
high-flyer, in terms of trading volume and share performance, was BTR,
another dividend-boosted stock.
NatWest Securities, noting that since last April, the gross dividend base of
the market has risen by 5 per cent, is lifting its own dividend growth
forecast to 7 per cent for 1994, which, it calculates, represents a real
increase of around 4 per cent.
Significantly, NatWest now predicts a switch away from the consumer sector
as the likely engine of economic recovery, preferring the diversified
manufacturing stocks; consumer-oriented sectors are still suffering a flow
of downgradings in profit forecasts.
Forecasts for earnings growth in the retail sector are, significantly, only
around 13 per cent for this year, compared with about 16 per cent for the
market as a whole. The likely impact next month of the Budget changes in
taxation, the less confident view on domestic interest rates and the
generally lacklustre image of some retail group managements, have combined
to cast a cloud over the sector.
Dixons and Burton both have fallen out of favour in the market and are now
seen in some quarters as yesterday's stocks. Dixons, having pleased the
stock market and nation's high streets alike with its aggressive marketing
of electronic goods, has never quite recovered after a disappointing
statement on Christmas trading. Now the spotlight has turned on the
implications of the OFT investigation into warranties.
Burton is regarded as a victim of its policy of discounting at its Multiples
chains, which are believed to have weakened brand names.
A similar cloud has fallen over the commercial property sector, where
anticipation, at least on the part of some investors, continues to outrun
performance. Confidence in a long-awaited recovery in office property in the
City of London has been jolted by the first of the December results
statements.
For the near term, the focus will be on prospects in European property, with
Brixton Estates and Hammerson reporting soon.

   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
According to Ms Alison Cottrell of Midland Global Markets Research,
investors' disappointment with the meagre 3 basis point cut in the repo rate
last week was a 'triumph of imagination over experience'.
She points out that the Bundesbank rarely cuts the repo rate by 10 points or
more without following up with a cut in the discount rate.
This is currently unlikely, she says, in the aftermath of embarrassingly
high growth in M3 money supply in January (the annualised, seasonally
adjusted growth rate was revised up from 20.6 per cent to 21.2 per cent on
Friday), however strong the fundamentals in terms of easing inflationary
pressures.
Thus this Thursday's meeting of the Bundesbank's policy-making council is
not tipped to cut the discount rate from its current level of 5.25 per cent.
The central bank may take the opportunity to announce a fixed rate tender
for next week, thereby ushering money market rates down further, but the
best that can be hoped for this week is a further minuscule cut in the repo
rate after another variable rate tender.
The market will also reflect on the outcome of yesterday's elections in the
state of Lower Saxony and the impact of last Friday's pay settlement for
public sector workers.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With seasonal profit-taking ahead of the March year-end almost over,
volatility on the government bond market is expected to subside this week.
Bond traders believe the worst is over for the JGB market, as the yield on
the No 157 10-year benchmark closed last week at 3.94 per cent, off its
week's high of 4.1 per cent.
Brokers SG Warburg in Tokyo believes bond yields have risen too quickly. It
says the recent plunge has pushed real bond yields up to the average of 1991
and 1992 and considering the still sluggish economic conditions, there is
room for the 10-year bond yield to fall to 3.6 per cent.
Japanese bond market participants will also be focusing on US interest rates
this week. The recent fall on the Tokyo market has been exacerbated by the
sell-off in international bond markets. Sentiment will remain jittery as
long as the US Treasury bond market is unstable.
The Bank of Japan is expected to keep a loose grip on short-term money
market rates. Demand for funds is expected to rise as a new reserve
maintenance period for banks' deposits at the central bank starts on
Wednesday. Mr Yasushi Mieno, BoJ governor, last week warned of the negative
impact of higher long-term interest rates on the economy, and is likely to
continue to prevent a rise in overnight call rates.

The financing of takeovers in the US passed a significant milestone last
week. As an all-cash, Dollars 2bn battle broke out in the defence industry
for Long Island-based Grumman, the message to the financial markets was loud
and clear: the banks are back.
A Dollars 1.9bn offer from Martin Marietta, launched at the start of the
week, was underwritten in its entirety by JP Morgan and Bank of America,
with the two banks making an additional Dollars 500m available on top. By
Thursday, rival Northrop had responded with a Dollars 2bn bid, backed by
total commitments of Dollars 2.8bn from Chase Manhattan and Chemical.
The extra cash available to both bidders immediately raised the spectre of a
bank-financed bidding war, pushing Grumman's market value on Friday up to
Dollars 2.2bn.
Neither offer is highly leveraged. Northrop has minimal gearing at present,
with debt only 10 per cent of total capital. Standard &amp; Poor's calculates
that Martin Marietta's gearing would go up from 36 per cent to 54 per cent
if it wins the battle for Grumman. Yet the willingness of some of the US's
biggest financial institutions to lay more than Dollars 1bn each on the line
inevitably prompts comparisons with the debt-financed acquisitions of the
1980s, known for their leverage.
Starved of opportunities to lend, a whole array of US and foreign banks have
pinpointed acquisition finance as one area of growth.
'There is a great deal of bank money chasing far too few deals,' says Mr
Stewart Boswell of North Carolina-based NationsBank, one of a number of
banks whose ambitions to play a prominent role in big corporate transactions
is making the bank lending market increasingly competitive. If banks are so
eager to lend again, can reckless leverage be far behind?
Until recently, the US's latest takeover wave had been carried along by a
buoyant equity market, prompting a rash of all-share bids. Now, two things
have changed. First, with short-term US interest rates widely expected to
rise further, the stockmarket has lost some of its shine.
Second, equity investors are no longer so confident in the ability of
acquisitive companies to expand without diluting their earnings. The Dollars
10bn battle for Paramount Communications did much to change sentiment. As
the share prices of bidders Viacom and QVC came under pressure, both fell
back increasingly on bank finance to support their offers.
The banks are more than ready to fill the gap. Acquisition financing could
help to plug part of the hole left by the slide in banks' lending to their
big business customers so far in the 1990s. Total commercial and industrial
lending by US banks has picked up slightly from its low point in the third
quarter of last year, but is still around Dollars 100bn lower than the peak
Dollars 600bn reached in 1990.
More important to the banks, though, are the fees for underwriting big
transactions. Equity-financed deals favoured Wall Street's investment banks,
which reaped big underwriting profits last year. Transactions backed with
debt, on the other hand, will boost the fee income of commercial banks -
particularly now that the biggest of them have the ability to arrange bond
deals as well as syndicated loans.
Underwriting fees vary greatly, depending on the amount of leverage
involved. For committing Dollars 100m to back Loral's acquisition of IBM's
aerospace business, for instance, banks were offered fees of 6.5 basis
points. On the other hand, those committing Dollars 25m to the Dollars 1.5bn
transaction to releverage Jefferson Smurfit in the US are being paid 150
basis points.
A handful of money-centre banks are coming to dominate the business. The
Grumman battle is unusual in that just four banks have committed more than
Dollars 5bn between them. Two of the four - Morgan and Chemical - also
featured in the bank financing of the rival bids for Paramount, acting for
Viacom and QVC respectively (Citibank also acted as a joint-lead for
Viacom.)
The availability of bank money - together with the renaissance last year of
the junk bond market - has also kicked the leveraged buy-out business back
into life. The Dollars 1.5bn Jefferson Smurfit deal (Dollars 1.3bn of it
underwritten in the bank market, with another Dollars 250m of junk bonds)
involves the first leveraged bank financing of more than Dollars 1bn since
1990, when the buy-out market last ground to a halt.
How far will it go? The limitations on leverage at the moment are being
imposed by buyers, rather than financiers. The equity component in a typical
leveraged transaction has fallen to 20 per cent or less, from 25 to 30 per
cent last year, but is still higher than the 5 - 10 per cent level common in
the 1980s.
'Leverage is back. It's just a question of how far companies want to go,'
says Mr James Lee, managing director in charge of structured finance at
Chemical, probably the most aggressive bank in the leveraged buy-out
business at the moment. With such views now common among bankers, it may not
be long before the multi-billion leveraged buy-out is back.

FT  14 MAR 94 / World Bond Markets: Renewed interest in index-linked gilts -
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After underperforming conventional UK government bonds in the recent
sell-off, index-linked gilts could outperform the rest of the market in
coming months, some analysts say. While UK inflation forecasts vary, the
uncertain inflation outlook may fuel interest in the index-linked sector.
Meanwhile, other countries are warming to index-linked bonds, with Sweden
planning to kick off its index-linked sector with an issue of 20-year
zero-coupon bonds in April.
Index-linked gilts were created to offer investors a hedge against
inflation, as measured by the Retail Prices Index. Interest payments and the
amount due at maturity are adjusted to reflect changes in the RPI. If retail
prices rise, an index-linked gilt provides a nominal gain from purchasing
the stock at issue and holding it to maturity. If retail prices fall, the
expected redemption value of an index-linked stock also declines, but
retains its value in real terms.
In the UK there are currently 15 index-linked stocks in issue, with an
outstanding nominal value of around Pounds 21.5bn - about 11 per cent of the
total gilt market.
Since the beginning of the year, conventional gilts have posted a total
return of minus 3.7 per cent, compared with a loss of 4.5 per cent in the
index-linked sector (to Thursday's close), says Mr Chris Dillow, UK
economist at Nomura Research Institute.
The recent sell-off in gilts was largely sparked by external factors: a rise
in US yields following the Federal Reserve's monetary tightening,
frustration at the slow pace of Bundesbank easing, and heavy bond sales by
highly leveraged speculators. The resulting rise in conventional yields
dragged index-linked yields higher. Indeed, index-linked fared worse than
conventional gilts because their lower yield base and longer duration means
their price is more sensitive and will move more sharply on identical shifts
in yield.
According to Mr Dillow, index-linked yields are determined not by 'real
economy' factors, but by conventional bond yields minus inflation
expectations, where conventional yields are determined principally by
short-term rates and overseas yields, and where inflation expectations
include an allowance for inflationary risk.
'Index-linked yields have risen because conventional yields have risen by
more than inflation expectations,' he says.
This suggests that index-linked gilts can outperform conventionals in the
next few months, mainly because falling overseas yields may push UK yields
lower, he says.
In the US this would be a stabilisation in yields after the recent sell-off.
In Germany, the case for lower yields is stronger, with the Bundesbank
aggressively cutting short-term rates as inflation and M3 money supply
growth weaken, he says.
Moreover, the gap between index-linked and conventional yields could widen
as index-linked gilts benefit from rising UK inflationary expectations.
For example, the yield gap between the 9 per cent gilt due 2008 and the 2
1/2 per cent index-linked due 2009 has widened to 4.11 per cent on Friday,
from 3.60 per cent on December 31
Meanwhile, Sweden is setting up its own index-linked market. It plans to
raise up to SKr10bn in an auction of 20-year zero-coupon bonds in the week
of April 18, says Mr Staffan Crona, director-general at the Swedish National
Debt Office.
Sweden is the first country to issue zero-coupon index-linked bonds, which
Mr Crona says offer better inflation protection and are easier to price.
'We hope to attract institutional investors with a long-term view, such as
life insurers and the national Swedish pension fund. They are very keen on
having investments that offer real interest rates over a long period, as
they often have to make payments to their clients in 20 or 30 years' time,'
he said, adding 'some of them have already shown great interest'.
If the results of the first issue are satisfactory, 'we will probably
continue issuing index-linked bonds to the institutional market, and may
also issue bonds with smaller denominations to attract retail investors', he
says. The first bond will probably be issued in denominations of SKr100,000
or SKr1m.
Liquidity in the index-linked sector will be limited at first, Mr Crona
says. 'I don't think the market will be as liquid as the big benchmark loans
in the Swedish government bond market, but it is our ambition to a create
liquid market for index-linked bonds as well.'

After several weeks of being buffeted by overseas influences, the gilts
market will have some chunky UK economic statistics to chew on this week.
But traders will still be watching for signs of Federal Reserve tightening
and Bundesbank easing.
'Gilts are being driven by what is happening across the Atlantic,' according
to Mr James Barty, UK economist at Morgan Grenfell. Many analysts have
argued that the economic fundamentals do not justify the recent falls in
European bond markets, which started when the US raised interest rates on
February 4. European markets, say analysts, should be able to decouple from
the US influence; but so far they have failed to do so. Gilts have fared
particularly badly, and suffered once more on Friday.
'The fundamentals may allow gilts to decouple at the shorter end of the
yield curve, but we are not yet at the stage where the market can decouple
at the longer end,' reckons
Mr Barty.
This week's information includes unemployment and retail sales, which will
be scrutinised for signs of the strength of the recovery; and producer
prices and average earnings, which will be monitored for inflationary
pressures. Mr Barty says next week's data 'will help the gilts market if it
shows continued low inflation and modest growth'.

Reason may argue that the rise in US bond yields has already more than
discounted the possibility of another increase in interest rates, but
sentiment continues to dictate otherwise. Last week the Treasury 30-year
bond yield rose to 6.98 per cent as the market ran scared again, this time
on political uncertainties caused by the investigation into the Whitewater
land deal.
This week, the market is probably in a mood for consolidation. But it is
unlikely to get it. It faces what Salomon Brothers describes as the
statistical equivalent of a daylight bombing run as three key price reports
are published on three consecutive days.
The raid starts on Tuesday with the publication of the producer price index
for February. Salomon predicts the index will rise by 0.5 per cent, the
largest monthly gain since last April - though excluding the volatile food
and energy sectors, it believes the increase could be a more palatable 0.3
per cent.
Wednesday sees the publication of the consumer price index, with analysts
predicting an acceleration from January's 0.1 per cent to 0.3 or 0.4 per
cent for February. Then, on Thursday, the Philadelphia Business Outlook
Survey could scare the market if, as expected, it shows an increase in the
proportion of manufacturers expecting input and output prices to rise.

KUALA LUMPUR
Malaysia's year-old Securities Commission is considering more rules to stamp
out insider trading and stock market manipulation, Munir Majid, the chairman
has announced.
Malaysia's Registry of Companies said two 'middle level' company officials
were being investigated for insider trading and six had been put on a
'scrutiny list'.
BEIJING
The number of shareholding companies in China last year rose by 9,440, to
13,000 with total capitalisation of Yn208.63bn. Listed companies numbered
122, with 215 stocks traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges. Many
state-owned activities have been reorganised into shareholding companies in
what could be a first step to a formal listing.
MEXICO
Foreign investment in Mexican stocks trading locally and abroad fell by 8
per cent in February from January levels, and total foreign investment in
Mexican stocks at the end of February was Dollars 56.2bn, the stock exchange
reported.
BRAZIL
Details of of the privatisation of Brazil's electricity industry should be
ready by the middle of 1994, according to Mr Jose Luiz Alqueres, president
of state electricity holding, Eletrobras. The industry, which has a book
value of Dollars 45bn, has been restructured along market-oriented lines and
long-standing debts owed by Eletrobras subsidiaries to the holding company
and the government have been resolved, he said.
MANILA
The stock exchange has adopted a set of trading rules, most of which are
currently being observed by the Manila and Makati bourses, for the planned
unified exchange. The rules include an automatic freeze on a price of an
issue if it moves up 50 per cent or falls by 40 per cent on a particular day
from its previous close.
The Philippine National Oil Company is to offer 1bn shares of Petron, its
most profitable subsidiary, in May, priced at between 6 pesos and 16 pesos.
A third of the shares will be targeted at foreign investors.
INDIA
Prices of Indian shares listed abroad have fallen sharply in the past week
and the downturn is likely to delay several Euroissues in the pipeline,
brokers have warned.
However, analysts in London and Bombay said the fall in overseas-listed
shares had not dimmed foreign interest and a Dollars 1bn telecom issue,
India's largest, would still go ahead.
WARSAW
A Polish parliamentary commission is to ask the State Protection Office and
the National Auditing Office to investigate possible wrongdoing during the
privatisation of Bank Slaski. The commission wants to know if the bank
manipulated profits in first half of 1993 to cut the issue price.
TAIPEI
Taiwan's state-run Farmers Bank of China plans a rights issue of 250m shares
and will list on the stock market in July as part of the government's
privatisation programme.
The rights issue will expand the bank's paid-in capital to TDollars 7.5bn
from TDollars 5.0bn, reducing the government's stake to 61.5 per cent.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Emerging Markets: Markets seek clarity on interest rates -
Currency Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A critical week lies ahead for foreign exchanges with the release of
inflation data in the US and UK, and a Bundesbank council meeting, likely to
point the way to future interest rate developments on both sides of the
Atlantic.
The focus of attention will be the mid-week publication of February producer
and consumer prices in the US. These data will set the scene for the meeting
of the (policy making) Federal Open Market Committee on the March 22.
Financial markets have had the jitters about US inflation ever since the Fed
lifted interest rates by 25 basis points last month. But some analysts argue
that the central bank will tighten less aggressively than the market
believes.
The US currency remains vulnerable to fall-out from the Whitewater political
scandal, but attention this week should focus on the economy.
The dollar is likely be stronger against the yen following the weekend
settlement of a long-running cellular phone dispute between the US and
Japan. The deal improves and accelerates the US company Motorola's access to
the Japanese market.
It is a clear victory for the strong-arm tactics of the US, and should help
the two countries resolve their broader trade dispute. Recent history
suggests that progress in these talks favours the dollar.
In Europe the market will be watching to see whether the Bundesbank uses
Germany's improving inflation outlook to quicken the pace of interest rate
cuts. The central bank's council meets on Thursday.
Foreign exchanges will also be watching yesterday's election for the Lower
Saxony state parliament, the first in a series of 19 regional and national
polls in Germany between now and October. A strong protest vote against the
political establishment could weaken the D-Mark.
In the UK, the release of producer inflation data, retail sales and
unemployment figures will set the tone for interest rates. There is no
consensus about the direction of the next move in rates, and there are
indications that the market may take its lead from the US rather than
Europe.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Emerging Markets: Hong Kong's blueprint for reform - The
Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Hong Kong stock exchange is growing up. Last year it doubled its market
capitalisation; oiled the wheels of trading with the introduction of
automated order matching and execution and a central clearing system; and
brought six mainland state-owned enterprises to market.
It has faced criticism too: the listing process is clearly less than
healthy, with many issues being heavily oversubscribed, and regulators have
been accused of over-zealousness when it comes to vetting both these and
disclosure statements. The listing of the Chinese companies did not pass
without mutterings, mainly over the way in which they were brought to
market.
Now, however, the stock exchange wants to go further, strengthening its role
as the financial centre of one of the most exciting regions of the world by
embracing standards and philosophies used on Wall Street.
If market practitioners accept the ambitious proposals laid out in the
consultative paper distributed last week, China will inherit a world class
exchange which has won the full confidence of investors, big and small,
across the globe.
What Mr Paul Chow, chief executive of the exchange, wants to create is a
market which is both efficient and competitive in the international arena.
He wants to focus on China, making Hong Kong its international capital
market, but his plan includes local listings of multinationals and,
possibly, the creation of Hong Kong Global Depositary Receipts.
To this end, his blueprint for reform - which is up for discussion over the
next five weeks - provides for a greater onus on issuers, directors and
substantial shareholders and their advisers, based on higher disclosure and
backed by sanctions for abusers; the extension of automation to member
offices and perhaps overseas; and a fully fledged derivatives and debt
market.
Prefacing its options, the paper notes: 'In view of the increasingly
competitive international environment in which it operates, the Exchange
believes that when considering development issues it must place the emphasis
on an 'international' solution. US market practice, or the practice of other
developed markets, may provide such international standard.'
But while investors broadly endorse the goal, there is more scepticism over
the means recommended. Two key issues split market users, and inform the
direction they wish to see the exchange take: the maturity of the market and
its ability to take on board a radical switch towards greater
self-regulation; and, at issue in any discussion, self interest.
Many merchant bankers and fund managers welcome the proposed switch in
listing philosophy from the existing common law based regulatory system
towards the self-vetting US model, which does away with stock exchange
vetting on new issues and disclosures and so speeds the process.
But there is also a sizeable contingent which feels that Hong Kong is not
ready for such a step: its emerging market status can be interpreted in this
way and foreign investors, in particular, may feel uncomfortable with a
regime more akin to self regulation.
Mr Richard Witts, managing director of United Mok Ying Kie, a local
brokerage and a member of the stock exchange council, says that the move
relies on quality advisers. 'The question is whether we have sufficiently
good advisers. Can our advisers be trusted?'
Mr Witts's argument is not directed solely at market practitioners in the
colony: the model has proved far from flawless in the US itself, where a
spate of scandals has plagued regulators.
Creating an environment where scandals are more likely to breed - which is
the primary concern when wiping out the role of the regulators as final
arbiters of listing applications - is far more likely to deter institutional
investors rather than entice them in, he says.
The recommendation to abolish minimum commissions, now standing at 0.25 per
cent, will not pass without a battle, either. Fund management operations and
securities houses often sit together in the same group.
Some say that the commission issue is a bargaining counter in the dispute
over stamp duties: lowering the one could pave the way for a reduction in
the other. The exchange has already opened discussions with the government
with a view to reducing, and ultimately scrapping the stamp duty levy, which
stands at 0.15 per cent on buyer and seller. It argues that the
international trend is to eliminate such taxes.
Leading the attack on the abolition of minimum commission, Mr Robert Thomas,
managing director of Jardine Fleming Investment Management says: 'It is very
detrimental to Hong Kong to abolish minimum commission because I think the
minute you do that you encourage the market maker role to come in, which
affects the whole broker/client relationship.
'It encourages deals to be done off market, and to my mind the most
efficient market is if all deals go through one point.'
The less contentious recommendations put forward in the consultative paper
would serve to underline Hong Kong's role as a window on the biggest
emerging market of all - China - and to draw increasing volumes of foreign
money into the mainland, while developing a strong capital-raising base in
the colony.
A key plank to this vision is one of the more nuts-and-bolts proposals:
extended automation and increased trading hours. Although Hong Kong is the
biggest market in Asia outside Japan, last year it was only fourth in terms
of trading volume.
With an efficient central clearing system in place, longer trading hours are
now perfectly feasible. They are seen as long overdue. Open for just
three-and-a-half hours a day, Hong Kong seriously lags behind the rest of
the region.
They would also be a means of winning back some of the business lost to
London. Recently, the London share in the turnover of Hong Kong stocks
quoted or listed there has been about 15 per cent.

FT  14 MAR 94 / The Markets: Global implications of the 'New Liberalisation'
 -Economic Eye
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the course of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, set
to be completed next month in Marrakesh, more than 60 developing and former
communist economies notified the secretariat of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade of unilateral trade liberalisation. This represented a
policy revolution, historically unrivalled in terms of the number of
countries and human beings affected.
An important question is whether this shift in policy direction will prove
temporary. An important book*, published last year, suggests a subtle reason
why it will not. It does so in calling attention to what the authors call a
'new liberalisation', in which 'deterioration of the current account led to
a package of crisis policies that included trade liberalisation'.
There is a general awareness in developing countries of the benefits of the
market and, more specifically, of liberal trade and greater exports. But
policy-makers have also come to accept what industrial countries realised a
decade or two ago, namely, that restrictions on imports are not just an
inappropriate response to balance of payments crises, but actually a
damaging one.
A country's ability to do well in the long run depends partly on how well it
navigates past short run obstacles. The 1970s and 1980s threw down a series
of such obstacles: a synchronised global boom, two oil price shocks, the
explosion of bank lending in the 1970s, the US monetary and fiscal shocks
under Paul Volcker and Ronald Reagan, the debt crisis of 1982 and then the
oil price collapse of 1986.
Wanting to learn how developing countries had coped with this turbulence,
the World Bank commissioned a study of 18 developing countries. This book
summarises the results.
The lessons drawn by the authors seem solid common sense, perhaps the most
important being that it is not external shocks, but domestic responses that
determine success or failure.
The authors note that there are profligate dictatorships and prudent
democracies; that the convictions of those who determine policy are
decisive, but that experience can change beliefs, even in Argentina; that
macroeconomic stability is good for long-run growth; that sudden increases
in investment are likely to prove wasteful; that it is foolish to assume
loans will be refinanced; that beneficial windfalls cannot be expected to
last; that policies and economies must be kept flexible; that rapid export
growth is essential, as is fiscal control; and that foreign aid can be
helpful in a crisis.
They also conclude that high inflation is lethal, in itself and because of
the costs of lowering it, while moderate inflation is not obviously
damaging; that inflation is ultimately home grown; and that liberalising
imports, while using the exchange rate as an 'anchor' for inflationary
expectations, is very risky.
This last point relates directly to the new liberalisation. Historically,
note the authors, the standard response to a balance of payments crisis was
increased restriction of imports. But because a restraint on imports is also
a restraint on exports, those restrictions would not reduce external
deficits, except in the short term.
Instead, current account deficits would tend to re-emerge, but at a lower
level of trade. The resulting vicious circle of import compression would,
when crisis struck, lead to what the authors call 'import starvation'.
Article XII of the Gatt allowed industrial countries to use quantitative
import restrictions for balance of payments purpose. Over time, however,
they realised that what was needed, instead, was macroeconomic adjustment.
Article XVIII gave developing countries a comparable authorisation, but many
of them continued to use it to justify import controls decade after decade.
The new liberalisation indicated developing country acceptance of the modern
theory of balance of payments adjustment: that trade policy should be
assigned to long run economic efficiency, while balance of payments
management depends on fiscal and monetary adjustment, combined with exchange
rate flexibility. With this realisation, an important obstacle to sustaining
trade liberalisation disappears.
The charts show what has happened to the trade of those developing countries
that dared to undertake liberalisation during the past 30 years: Korea from
the mid-1960s, Chile from the mid-1970s, Turkey from 1980, Indonesia in the
mid-1960s and again in the 1980s and Mexico and Thailand in the 1980s. In
all these cases, ratios of trade to output rose.
In the 1950s and 1960s trade grew faster than output for most industrial
countries. Thereafter, the impulse to growing openness lost momentum, partly
because liberalisation was far advanced already. Now it is the turn of
developing countries. In 1976, Korea's imports were 7 per cent of those of
the US; in 1991, they were 16 per cent, while it had also become the world's
12th largest import market. But Korea has been only a forerunner of far
bigger players, such as China and India.
The new liberalisation suggests that the developing countries are now on the
same intellectual footing as the industrial countries, so far as balance of
payments adjustment is concerned. But many of their policy-makers tend also
to have a better appreciation of the efficiency benefits of trade
liberalisation. This means that their vast potential for further trade
expansion will probably become reality, with even balance of payments crises
failing to stop them.

FT  14 MAR 94 / The Markets: A nasty splash of Whitewater - Global Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The curious American political melodrama known as Whitewater has started to
produce a whitish knuckle or two in the US capital markets.
Nervousness over the implications of the affair for the Clinton presidency
could be a significant feature of the markets this week, together with the
central issue worrying Wall Street, which is the statistics for US inflation
due out tomorrow - the producer price index - and on Wednesday - the
consumer price index.
The Whitewater mess - it is not yet, and may never be worth dignifying with
the word scandal, despite all the baying for blood on Capitol Hill  - has
been building for months, but it was only late last week that it began to
impinge significantly on the consciousness of Wall Street.
The market's initially relaxed attitude was understandable.
The controversy revolves around some arcane investments, made more than a
decade ago, by Mr Clinton and his wife Hillary, in the Whitewater
Development Company, an Arkansas real estate venture, and that company's
ties to a failed Arkansas savings and loans business, Madison Guaranty.
When a group of investigative journalists initially started asking whether
the Clintons had benefited improperly from this web of relationships, the
question seemed of largely historic interest, and not one that impinged too
closely on the credibility of the Clinton administration.
However the issue has been so badly handled by the White House that the
Attorney General has had to appoint an independent special prosecutor to
investigate and over the past two weeks the focus of attention has switched
from the propriety of investments made long ago to whether the White House
has tried to 'cover up' the affair. This in turn has allowed Republicans to
draw a parallel with the Watergate 'cover up' which toppled President Nixon.
On the present evidence, it is preposterous to suggest that a similar fate
could befall Mr Clinton. But several events last week brought home to the
markets the extent to which Whitewater is consuming the President's time and
possibly eating into his political popularity, even though most Americans
seem to regard the affair as an incomprehensible storm in a Washington
teacup.
In quick succession last week the markets saw Whitewater claim a White House
staff member, Mr Bernard Nussbaum, who resigned over his contacts with
federal investigators; saw Mr Clinton besieged at news conferences with
questions about the matter and watched White House aides appear for the
first time before a federal grand jury looking into the matter.
The cumulative effect was to create an impression of a White House under
siege and a climate where wild market rumours could flourish. And they did
last Thursday, when an unsubstantiated report in an obscure Washington
newsletter raised questions about last summer's suicide of Mr Vincent
Foster, a White House aide and Arkansan friend of the Clintons. The bond
market plunged, and equities and the dollar dipped.
Weak dollar
The market hates political uncertainty and is growing concerned lest
Whitewater should weaken Mr Clinton, at least temporarily. Traders ask
whether he might then be tempted to take populist measures to restore his
popularity, such as tough trade sanctions against Japan or spending
programmes which might push up inflation.
Political uncertainty also weakens the dollar, and that inflates the cost of
imported goods. At the same time, a lame duck president would be unable to
take tough foreign policy action on some of the world's trouble spots.
That, together with political violence in South Africa, helps explain a
sharp rise last Thursday in the price of gold, a traditional safe harbour
against political turmoil.
However, last week's market reaction to Whitewater says more about Wall
Street's extreme jitteriness, which is the result of the Federal Reserve's
tightening of monetary policy last month, than it does about the political
risks of Whitewater to equity and bond values.
At present the risks still seem very small, though there is no real way of
knowing what dirt the investigative hounds may throw up. Still, the climate
is such that all sorts of rumours can be set running over the next few
months, allowing market speculators to make some quick killings. Past
investigations by special prosecutors have always been accompanied by a
constant drip of leaks and this one seems unlikely to be different.
Unless Whitewater turns into a genuine scandal, the biggest effect of the
affair could be to weaken the political clout of the unelected Mrs Clinton,
who is overseeing that central piece of the White House legislative agenda,
its heath care reform package.
Even before Whitewater, Congress had been expected to approve a far less
ambitious reform package than Mrs Clinton was seeking and this prospect has
been greatly reinforced by the events of the past two weeks.
That may be good for stocks in the health care sector, which have been
hammered by expectations of government price restrictions. In the short run,
a restricted health package might also give a little fillip to economic
expansion, ameliorating companies' fears that hiring workers would burden
them with a big rise in healthcare costs.
Inflation
Politics apart, Wall Street's central focus this week will be on the US
inflation figures for February, which are expected to show producer prices
rising at a rate of about 0.3 per cent, up from 0.2 per cent in January, and
consumer prices up by a similar amount, compared to no change in January.
Figures like this are hardly a sign of rampant inflation but the market is
currently so bearish that it tends to discount almost all good news and
pounce with relish on figures that are worse than expected. So getting
through this run of statistics without a further bond market dip may not be
easy.
The futures market is already suggesting the yield on the benchmark 30-year
issue may top 7 per cent before the bear run is over, and as Mr John Lipsky
of Salomon Brothers points out: 'The structure of forward rates now
anticipates much higher short rates and significant yield curve flattening.'
This stems in large measure from market expectations that the Federal
Reserve is likely to tighten monetary policy again in the next few weeks,
possibly on March 22, when its policy-making Open Market Committee next
meets.
The sharp and unexpected drop in global bond markets which accompanied
February's tightening may make the Fed cautious about further tightening
until the market calms down, yet it is unlikely to do so while the world
waits for the Fed to move.
The bull case
US economists are deeply divided over the need for the Fed's February
tightening, its first in five years. Most argue that it was a timely, even
overdue, response to the threat of inflation, which was already evident in
the sharply rising price of financial assets. Yet some argue that Mr Alan
Greenspan, the Fed chairman, is fighting an inflationary demon which does
not exist.
One of the most bullish of this school is Mr Edward Yardeni, chief economist
at CJ Lawrence, the brokers, who reckons that US inflation will run at only
2 per cent this year - the consensus is about 3 per cent. His central
argument is that this is not a typical recovery because of new, powerfully
disinflationary factors around the globe.
For one thing, the end of the Cold War has opened up huge pools of cheap
labour in the Eastern bloc, putting downward pressure on Western wage rates.
For another, the US is in the early stages of an information technology
revolution, demonstrated by a huge jump recently in its spending on
high-tech capital equipment. This should feed through into a big increase in
productivity, again ameliorating inflationary tendencies.
Mr Yardeni reckons that the Fed Funds rate will end 1994 where it is now, at
3 1/4 , and that the yield on long bonds could fall to the 5 per cent range
in 1995, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting 5000. Hence his
current slogan: '5/5 in 95.'
It is certainly not a mainstream view, but at the least it is a useful
reminder, amid the gloom of the current market correction, that the economic
outlook in the US remains bright, that the bull market in stocks may have
some way yet to run, and that next year could see Europe emerging from
recession.

FT  14 MAR 94 / International Company News: Microsoft to test PC network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, plans to test its
new cable television network dedicated to personal computing in April,
Reuter reports from Lisbon.
Mr Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, said over the weekend: 'We'll set up
five or six pilot stations, one of them definitely in Europe. The first
tests should take place in April 1995.'
He told a news conference at a seminar in Lisbon that locations for the
other channels had not yet been decided.
Plans for setting up the new channel, which is being formed with
Tele-Communications, the largest cable TV operator in the US, were announced
last week.
The cable network will review new types of software, video games and
financial software, and is expected to be available within 18 months.
'We want to create an easy-to-use interface on a lot of applications. Next
year's pilot will see if its worthwhile aggressively building the rest of a
high-speed optic fibre network,' Mr Gates said. 'We're betting on the market
and investing over Dollars 100m a year.'
He said that Microsoft would not make any programmes for the channel but
would provide software applications.
The two companies also plan to test a joint interactive cable TV system
based on Microsoft's software and Tele-comm's digital interactive network.
Europe provided a growing market for home personal computers, Mr Gates said.
'The market has already taken off in the United States and we're
anticipating that in Europe over the next several years.'
He said that Microsoft was looking into ways to boost distribution,
availability and exposure of personal computer products in the European
market.
'The PC user is different from the corporate one. These are not things we'd
do for our historic products,' Mr Gates said.

FT  14 MAR 94 / International Company News: Viag gets a Bavarian ring-fence
 -Germany's biggest privatisation to date
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone who still believes Germany's revived enthusiasm for privatisation
will open the way for participation in key sectors by outsiders needs look
no further than this week's sale of Bavaria's state-owned electricity
utility to Viag to confirm that this is hardly the case.
In a deal described as Germany's biggest privatisation to date, Viag agreed
to take full control of Bayernwerk and all its appendages, including a 24.9
per cent stake in Viag. In return, the Bavarian government is to walk away
with a thumping DM2.3bn (Dollars 1.3bn) in cash plus a minority blocking
stake of 25.1 per cent in the enlarged Viag group.
Just to be on the safe side, the ring-fence around Viag is reinforced by
hefty stakes in the safe custody of other Bavarian institutions. Local
banks, led by the Bayerische Vereinsbank have 15 per cent and Mr August von
Finck, of the famous local banking family, has 13.5 per cent.
Announcing the deal on Thursday, Mr Edmund Stoiber, Bavarian prime minister,
solemnly underscored his commitment to privatisation local-style with a
promise that the 25.1 per cent in the enlarged Viag (which is to move its
headquarters from Bonn to Munich) would be sold within the next five years.
It would go, he said, to a 'sensible' circle of shareholders - in the
interests of securing a 'solid energy policy for Bavaria'.
Viag executives, keen to promote the group as an international business (30
per cent of the stock is held by non-German investors) declared themselves
comfortable with a loyal local band around them. It offered 'protection
against raiders' while they got on with the job of restructuring.
'Raiders' was also a notional threat which worried Mr Werner Lamby, former
chairman. But that was back in 1989, one year after the Bonn government sold
its last 60 per cent stake in Viag. At that time the group's rapid-fire
acquisitions were attracting favourable attention, while rumours of a
looming break-up bid were exciting speculative share buyers.
Viag's shares had consistently out-performed the stock market since the
first stage of privatisation in 1986, and were to continue to do so until
late 1991.
That was when markets decided the buying spree and diversification had gone
far enough and it was time for a little consolidation. Now, involved in nine
disparate industrial divisions - energy, aluminium, transport, trading,
packaging, paper, refractory products, chemicals and a fledgling corporate
communications business - Viag suggests it is ready to put a little more
capital investment behind its helpful if rather hesitant progress so far.
In the recent past the VAW aluminium business has benefited from investments
to increase output of packaging materials. A new plant to supply engine
blocks for Ford reflects a potential-oriented policy move towards the motor
vehicle industry. But VAW still runs Germany's largest aluminium smelter,
even though production costs are a third higher than in other industrialised
countries.
Mr Georg Obermeier, finance director, who two years ago spoke of 'dressing
the VAW bride' in preparation for a part-flotation, accepts that a primary
source of the metal is not an essential adjunct to a successful aluminium
processor.
The SKW Trostberg chemicals business has been largely purged of loss-making
operations, but it has still not found the partner or partners required to
give it critical mass in its most promising business supplying the
construction industry. According to Mr Obermeier, negotiations to take a
body-building stake in the Goldschmidt group are well-advanced, and
'promising' talks are under way on at least two other fronts.
Paper production is a 'not-so-core' business, he says. The same goes for
Didier-Werke, the refractory products specialist, which has suffered from
contraction and fading investment among some of its principal customers in
the steel industry.
Unveiling the new-look Viag at a press conference on Thursday, Mr Obermeier
and his colleagues strove purposely to present a picture of newly-dynamised
group poised for a renewed surge of growth. The company would not shy away
from disinvestment or finding new homes for some businesses, declared Mr
Jochen Holzer, supervisory board chairman. Mr Obermeier promised strong
future growth and an early return to a progressive dividend policy.
The Frankfurt stock market, unable to rush to judgment on Thursday, when
Viag shares were suspended for the announcement of the terms of the
Bayernwerk deal, delivered it the following day, marking Viag shares down
more than 6 per cent to DM458.50.

losses

<TEXT>
Euro Disney faces losses for 1993-94, even if creditor banks and Walt
Disney, its largest shareholder, agree on a financial rescue package for the
struggling amusement park owner, AP-DJ reports from Paris.
In a report to be presented at today's annual stockholders meeting, Mr
Philippe Bourguignon, the chairman of Euro Disney, says that the deficit
will continue in the second half of this year, ending September.
Euro Disney is working against a March 31 deadline to agree a restructuring
plan with its banks and Walt Disney on its FFr21bn (Dollars 3.5bn) of debt.
The company lost FFr5.3bn in 1992-93.
'If the restructuring is carried out, these measures ought to improve the
financial situation of the group,' Mr Bourguignon says. 'But even so, the
group should find itself in a deficit situation for the first and second
halves of fiscal year 1994.'
Mr Bourguignon says in his report that the 'deeply unbalanced financial
structure of Euro Disney has become intolerable to the point of endangering
the existence of the enterprise.'
The future of the park depends almost entirely on the negotiations with the
63 banks and Walt Disney, which owns 49 per cent of Euro Disney, he says.

unit

<TEXT>
Dresdner Bank, Germany's second biggest bank, has set up a new research unit
to beef up its international securities markets activities.
Dresdner International Research Institute (DIRI), will provide research into
equities and fixed-income securities as well as advice on investors' asset
allocation strategies.
Mr Bernhard Walther, chief executive, says the move will help the bank
compete more effectively with research provided by Anglo-American and
Japanese securities institutions based primarily in London.
The move follows a similar step from Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank,
which set up DB Research in 1992.
The aim is to provide a high degree of independence from the parent bank,
with the aim of ironing out possible conflicts of interest with buyers of
stocks and bonds.
These conflicts are accentuated by the German universal banking system,
which allows banks to provide a vast range of lending and advisory services
under one roof and trade securities on their account.
Although Mr Klaus Friedrich, Dresdner's chief executive, is managing
director of the new institute, the bank's macroeconomics research will be
not be absorbed into DIRI.

FT  14 MAR 94 / International Company News: Managers in buy-out at Radio
Marconi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A group of 40 managers at Radio Marconi, Portugal's intercontinental
telecommunications operator, plan a Es30bn (Dollars 170m) management
buy-out.
The government has welcomed the bid for the state's 51 per cent holding, a
manager said.
The plan also has the support of UK and US institutional investors who own
30 per cent of company, he said.
The management group, led by Mr Francisco Murteira Nabo, president of the
holding company for Radio Marconi's overseas subsidiaries, aims to complete
the buy-out by June with financial backing from foreign and domestic banks
and investors.
Under the plan, Radio Marconi would hand over its concession to operate
intercontinental telephone services to Portugal Telecom, the single operator
to be formed in April from the merger of Portugal's two other wholly
state-owned telecommunications companies.
The managers want Radio Marconi to keep - and possibly increase - its 33 per
cent shareholding in Telecomunicacoes Moveis Nacionais (TMN), a mobile
telephone operator, and the business of 40 subsidiaries operating in 18
countries.
Radio Marconi's sales were Es46.5bn in 1993 and net profits totalled
Es4.2bn.
The buy-out would resolve what otherwise threatens to be a complex question
of the state reaching agreement with Radio Marconi's private shareholders on
a merger with Portugal Telecom.
However, officials indicated that the government may be reluctant to allow a
wholly private-sector Radio Marconi to keep its stake in TMN.
The group plans to invite Mr Goncalo Sequeira Braga, Radio Marconi
president, and other members of the executive board to join them in the
buy-out.
Employees in all of Portugal's telecommunications companies would also be
invited to invest.

FT  14 MAR 94 / International Company News: Henkel hit by rationalisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The costs of implementing rationalisation measures helped depress Henkel's
pre-tax profits by 7 per cent to DM375m (Dollars 218m) last year, the German
chemicals, cosmetics and cleaning products group said.
The rationalisation stood to benefit the group this year, however. It was
likely that the group would develop in a positive way this year despite
difficult economic conditions in many important markets, Henkel said.
Stripping out the costs associated with the reduction of employee numbers
from 42,244 to 40,480 last year, operating profits rose in 1994, the group
said, without giving details.
Turnover for the group dropped by 2 per cent to DM13.9bn but Henkel
explained that without the impact of currency fluctuations - which led to a
3 per cent drop in sales - turnover would have risen.
Turnover in Germany dropped by 3 per cent to DM4.16bn while sales generated
abroad dropped by 1.7 per cent to DM8.95bn. This was mainly due to a sharp
fall in turnover in continental Europe. Outside Europe, sales increased 13
per cent.
The group's two biggest businesses are chemicals and cleaning products,
which account for 27.4 and 31.3 per cent of group sales respectively.
Henkel said it was pleased with a 4 per cent increase in sales in this
market segment, reflecting recovery in the US. There was a 4 per cent fall
in cleaning products sales, chiefly due to currency fluctuations.

Samsung Corporation, South Korea's largest trading company, and the biggest
subsidiary within the Samsung group, has reported that net earnings for 1993
dropped by 22.9 per cent to Won12.2bn (Dollars 14.9m). Sales rose by 10.5
per cent to Won13,300bn.
Samsung Heavy Industries suffered a 23 per cent fall in net profits to
Won73bn due to price competition in the domestic construction equipment
sector. Sales remained flat at Won1,610bn.
A 33 per cent drop in sales of industrial machinery offset a 31 per cent
rise in revenues for its shipbuilding operations, the nation's third
largest.
Samsung Aerospace recorded a 18 per cent increase in net earnings to
Won5.2bn as sales surged by 40 per cent to Won680.9bn.
Turnover rose in all the aerospace offshoot's divisions, including a 36 per
cent jump at the defence division to Won184bn and a 42 per cent rise in the
optics division to Won177bn, supported by strong camera sales.
Samsung Electro-Mechanics, Korea's largest electronic components
manufacturer, achieved a 10 per cent increase in net profits to Won8.1bn.
Sales rose by 21 per cent to Won731.6bn due to strong demand from
electronics companies.

FT  14 MAR 94 / UK Company News: UK fund managers cautious on Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The weakness in global equity and bond markets during February did not
produce many significant shifts in investment policy among UK fund managers,
according to the monthly Smith New Court/Gallup survey of investor
intentions.
Although less inclined to run down their holdings of European equities than
last month, the latest survey found that managers continue to be much more
cautious about the near-term outlook for European equities than was the case
towards the end of last year.
The German market is the one where fund managers were most likely to reduce
their exposure. In contrast, the UK and Japanese markets continue to be ones
which managers expected to do best over the next three months
Fund managers' optimism about the outlook for the UK economy has faded a
little, however, with the percentage expecting conditions to improve over
the next 12 months remaining at 88 per cent. Only 17 per cent expect the
economy to get 'a lot better' compared with 21 per cent in February.
Institutions have also raised their forecasts on dividend growth from 6.3
per cent to 6.9 per cent.

FT  14 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Flexible Manufacturing sold to Giddings &amp;
Lewis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK subsidiary of Giddings &amp; Lewis, the US machine tool producer, has
bought the key assets of Flexible Manufacturing Technology, the
Brighton-based machine tool builder which called in the receivers last
month.
The sale effectively ends the presence of UK-owned companies in the
production of big machine tool cells and systems. Mr Mike Bright, former
chairman and driving force behind FMT, is not included in the deal.
The deal, for which terms were not disclosed, was clinched last Thursday
with Ernst &amp; Young, the receivers.
G&amp;L, which has its UK base at Knowsley, Merseyside, fought off bids from a
number of potential buyers. It is buying the FMT name and that of
Kearns-Richards, the Altrincham-based FMT unit, along with engineering and
patent rights, and the service, spare parts and machine rebuild businesses.
The acquisition does not include any of FMT's facilities, nor FMT's Noble &amp;
Lund unit, which makes big milling machines.
G&amp;L said on Friday it would be taking on about 30 FMT service engineers and
other staff. This would leave between 50 and 60 employees at FMT, but the
receivers are making some further redundancies at Brighton. Work in progress
is being completed there over the next few months.
G&amp;L said the acquired businesses would ultimately be moved to Knowsley. The
deal would expand its customer base and underline its financial strength
through its ability to acquire struggling businesses.
If it wished, G&amp;L would be able to manufacture machining centres under the
FMT name, although observers consider this unlikely. But it will in any case
be gaining a profitable spares and service business.
The deal is another twist in the chequered history of FMT, whose predecessor
companies employed thousands in the 1950s and 1960s.
A deal in 1973 created Kearney and Trecker, Marwin, which became a
subsidiary of Vickers in 1977. In 1988 Mr Bright led a management buy-out of
what was then still called KTM.

in operating profits from Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 3.6m for the year to January
29. Turnover grew by 17 per cent to Pounds 20.9m (Pounds 17.9m).
The flotation, which will be primarily through a share placing, is expected
to value the company at between Pounds 35m and Pounds 40m.
The proceeds will pay off debt of about Pounds 14m and fund more store
openings.
After opening outlets at London's Covent Garden and at Heathrow and Gatwick
airports, the company is considering stores in overseas airports, the
Channel Tunnel complex, and other areas with high tourist densities.
Hamleys recently did a deal to operate toy concessions in some House of
Fraser department stores. It also sees opportunities for 'limited expansion
overseas' and development of the Hamleys brand.
The company's operating profits have almost trebled in a three-year
development programme implemented by Mr Howard Dyer, chief executive and
former head of US operations at Williams Holdings, and operations director
Mr Stephen Woodbridge, a former colleague from Williams.
Hamleys was acquired in a Pounds 22m management buy-in from Lowndes
Queensway led by Citicorp Venture Capital in 1989, shortly after Jimmy
Gulliver's group bought Harris Queensway from Sir Philip Harris.
Citicorp invited Mr Dyer to draw up a management plan for the business in
1991. He reduced costs, improved the retailing operations, purchasing and
management systems, and carried out a Pounds 3m revamp of the Regent Street
store.
His reward is to be promoted to chairman now the company is seeking a
listing, while Mr Woodbridge becomes managing director.
Mr Rupert Hambro, non-executive chairman since 1989, remains as a
non-executive director and chairman of newly-appointed audit and
remuneration committees.
Mr Dyer sees important opportunities for Hamleys as a 'retailer to the
tourist trade'. But he does not intend to follow the example of Sir Philip
Harris, who opened other Hamleys stores, such as those in Birmingham and
Edinburgh, which were unsuccessful.
Analysts suggest that the toy trade is too seasonal - with up to 75 per cent
of sales being made at Christmas - for Hamleys stores to be profitable in
cities without the tourist traffic of London.
But its Heathrow Airport and Covent Garden stores have proved a success, as
has its deal with British Airways to provide child passengers with packs of
toys branded with the Hamleys name.

FT  14 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Badgerline warns of losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Badgerline, the Avon-based bus company which last Monday announced doubled
pre-tax profits for 1993, is likely to be in the red after restating the
figures following the rejection of planning permission for a supermarket at
one of its depots.
The planning refusal will lead to a Pounds 5.2m write-down of the depot's
value in the company's balance sheet, with a net Pounds 5.2m being written
off pre-tax profits, directors explained.
Badgerline, which was floated last November, achieved pre-tax profits of
Pounds 6.9m, compared with Pounds 3.2m.
A public inquiry concerning the company's Kensington depot in Bath, where
Safeway wanted to build a supermarket, closed on January 20, but early last
week the company was still awaiting a decision. Two other schemes for
supermarkets in Bath were also turned down.
Mr Trevor Smallwood, executive chairman, said the group was disappointed by
the Secretary of State's rejection of the plans. He said the write-down
would have no impact in terms of the group's continuing profitability.

FT  14 MAR 94 / UK Company News: BP cuts finding costs to Dollars 3.51 per
barrel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Petroleum succeeded last year in lowering its finding costs and more
than replacing its oil and gas production, according to the company's annual
report.
Figures show that the company's reserve replacement ratio for oil and gas
was more than 125 per cent. Finding costs fell to Dollars 3.51 (Pounds 2.40)
per barrel of oil equivalent, compared with Dollars 4.41 in 1992. Anything
under Dollars 4 is considered good, according to analysts.
Revisions to existing reserves helped to boost the reserve replacement
figure. Such revisions are often made after new production fields are
brought on stream.
The good finding cost figure reflects, in part, the cost controls which have
been imposed in BP's exploration and production division, according to Mr
Jeremy Hudson, an analyst with Lehman Brothers.

Mr Allan Hardy has resigned as group commercial director of Yorkshire-Tyne
Tees Television, writes David Blackwell.
Last December the company warned of losses for the year ended that
September, but the deficit of Pounds 7.88m, announced in January, was lower
than expected.
Directors said it had been a difficult year, 'because certain sales policies
were pursued which damaged the company both in terms of its reputation and

FT  14 MAR 94 / Company News (This Week): Questions of survival may be on
the agenda - United Biscuits
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With luck, United Biscuits' full year figures on Thursday will be bad.
Otherwise they will be awful. The chief uncertainty is how much UB will
write off in closures and restructuring at its struggling US subsidiary,
Keebler. However, it seems clear that profits will be down not only in the
US, but in UB's British heartland as well.
The worse the figures, the more questions will be asked about UB's survival
as an independent entity. While the food industry becomes steadily more
global, UB risks going the other way. Even in 1992, the UK made up three
quarters of its profit. At this rate, the company could end up more
dependent on its home market than it was a decade ago. In a world
increasingly dominated by monsters like Nestle and Unilever, this is not a
sustainable strategy.
In its defence, UB might point to its painstakingly assembled European
business. This contributed one eighth of group turnover in 1992, which is
arguably not enough. In global terms, there is a bigger strategic danger.
The real growth in the food industry lies not in the developed world, but in
the developing countries of Asia and South America. The giants like Nestle
are investing there massively. UB cannot afford to do likewise.
A best guess for pre-tax profit is around Pounds 170m, compared to Pounds
162m the year before. This allows only for exceptional events already
announced: the closure of one US factory and the sale of the Ortiz business
in Spain, more than offset by the profit on the sale of Terry's chocolate.
In other words, underlying profits may be down for the second year running.
Stated earnings may be down too, as a result of a higher tax charge, though
with luck the dividend will be held. All that is on the basis of only Pounds
12m write-offs at Keebler. Much more than that, and the vultures could start
circling.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Flotation may value Ashanti at Pounds 1.5bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Preparations for the biggest gold mining company flotation for many years -
that of Ashanti Gold Fields of Ghana - are to be stepped up this week in
London.
Brokers James Capel and Ashanti's merchant bank Morgan Grenfell are expected
to give an indication in the pathfinder prospectus of the range within which
the shares will be priced, because the Ghana Exchange, where 5 per cent of
Ashanti will be sold, insists this is provided. The brokers are likely to
ask for a slight premium over most South African gold mining companies,
suggesting that Ashanti will be valued at as much as Pounds 1.5bn.
The Ghanaian government, the majority shareholder, is to sell 25 per cent of
Ashanti. Lonrho, the UK-based trading group, has indicated it will not sell
any of its 49 stake.
There have been some indications that Ashanti might use the opportunity to
raise new capital. The group is coming to the end of a substantial
investment programme, so that in 1996 it will join the handful of gold
companies producing more than one million troy ounces a year.

FT  14 MAR 94 / UK dividend rises exceed predictions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the UK results season well in train, the London stock market has reason
to be encouraged by the reports from the corporate battle front. There have
been few nasty shocks among large companies, while dividend increases have
exceeded expectations.
Nearly all of the financial sector has reported on 1993, while around a
third of industrial groups have announced.
If there has been any disappointment with reported profits figures, it is
largely due to higher than expected provisions. Perhaps the largest surprise
came from British Gas, which announced a Pounds 1.65bn restructuring charge,
while Unilever set aside Pounds 490m for reorganisation, and British
Aerospace's profits were hit by a Pounds 308m exceptional charge.
Even so, some take comfort from the view that one year's provisions are the
next year's profit increases.
The forecasts for corporate profits are distorted also by the introduction
of the FRS 3 accounting standard, which has put such provisions above the
line. Thus many brokers have two forecasts, one for FRS 3 profits and a
second of underlying profits.
Mr Mark Brown, strategist at Hoare Govett, the stockbrokers, says he is
disappointed by the results so far but blames the higher incidence of
provisions. His forecast of an FRS 3 pre-tax profits rise of 35 per cent for
the industrial sector has been undershot so far by 13 percentage points.
By contrast, Mr Roger Barker, equity strategist at UBS, the securities
house, says he is happy with the results he has seen. He expects his 13 per
cent forecast for underlying industrial profits growth from the top 250
companies in 1993 to be beaten, with the out-turn probably at around 16 per
cent by the time the results season winds up at the end of this month. That
ties in with Mr Brown's calculation that earnings growth stripping out
exceptionals has been 17 per cent from industrial companies that have
reported so far.
Like UBS's Mr Barker, Mr Robert Buckland at NatWest Markets says that the
results so far have been much in line with expectations. There has been no
rush to downgrade 1994 forecasts as there would have been if companies had
disappointed, he says.
The good news has been on the dividend front. Large or unexpected increases
have come from Vickers, Glaxo, SmithKline Beecham, Reuters, BTR, Standard
Chartered and BAT Industries. At the other end of the scale, Fisons and
Ladbroke have each roughly halved their payments.
As a result, forecasts of dividend growth in 1993 will have been too
pessimistic. UBS's forecast of 3 per cent growth could turn out to be 2
percentage points too low, says Mr Barker. At Hoare Govett, Mr Brown says
dividends reported so far by large industrial groups are up 8 per cent.
Analysts had expected companies to rebuild their dividend cover before
increasing payouts significantly. But it appears that companies are taking
advantage of their much strengthened financial position to reward
shareholders and possibly they are sufficiently convinced that the UK has
entered a low-inflation era to feel comfortable with lower levels of cover.
In addition, perhaps they are showing in dividends a greater confidence
about 1994 than they have been prepared to express in chairmen's statements.
This also explains the lack of rights issues. Only last week Barclays Bank,
BAT and Cadbury Schweppes all denied plans to call on shareholders for new
capital. Only two rights issues so far this year have exceeded Pounds 100m,
from GKN and Burford Holdings. Those and the third largest, Berisford
International's Pounds 56.1m call, were all to finance acquisitions.
After Pounds 30bn of rights issues in the past four years, the corporate
sector is now sporting a financial surplus instead of a deficit. Takeover
activity - aside from the three mentioned - has been low.
In the coming months one question exercising the minds of companies and
economists is whether that financial strength will be channelled into
investment to build new capacity, which will be required as demand in the
economy picks up.
If the results season has been generally better than expected, it has not
been reflected in the performance of the stock market. Equities have been
affected by other concerns, such as the performance of the bond markets and
worries over interest rates. As Mr Barker observes, many companies need to
produce good profit increases simply to justify the ratings their shares are
on.
At Hoare Govett, Mr Brown is advising investors to stick with the companies
which are increasing dividends by more than the average. With uncertainty
abounding in markets, investors are attracted to higher yields and faster
dividend growth.
These, he feels, will come from the consumer and service sectors, where
dividend cover is higher and the potential for growth better than in the
manufacturing area, where profits may recover but dividend cover is still
low. Glynwed, for instance, reported a 47 per cent rise in profits, but it
has paid the same dividend for five years in a row and this is the first
time in three years it has been covered by earnings.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Finland joins with Russia in gas venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gazprom, the Russian monopoly gas company, is to take a 25 per cent stake in
a new joint venture with Neste, the Finnish state energy group, in a deal
that will lead to a substantial increase in Russian gas exports to Finland.
Neste will place its natural gas division into the joint venture, which is
due to begin in May. In 1992 the division, which is the sole supplier of gas
in Finland, accounted for 3 per cent of Neste's total net sales and 2 per
cent of its investment.
The new company would have net sales of around FM1.5bn (Pounds 170m). Total
capital in the venture will be FM2.5bn, of which 40 per cent will be equity.
Gazprom's stake of the equity capital would be around FM250m, according to
Mr Jaakko Ihamuotila, Neste's chief executive officer.
'The intention is to seek a stock exchange listing for the company,' he
said. That could happen as early as May next year.
The deal with Gazprom includes a new 20-year gas supply contract, under
which Finnish imports of Russian gas could rise to more than 4bn cubic
metres a year from the present level of 2.9bn cubic metres.
Neste said it had encouraged Gazprom to enter the joint venture because the
holding will strengthen Gazprom's interest in developing the Finnish gas
market. It will also encourage Gazprom to increase its transmission capacity
to Finland, say Neste officials.
Natural gas accounts for about 8 per cent of total Finnish energy demand,
with the main users being power stations and large industrial customers.
Demand is expected to grow strongly in coming years, although there has been
uncertainty over the source of future supplies.
Russia has supplied gas to Finland since 1974, and although there has been
no disruption in shipments in recent years, Finns have looked at ways to
lessen their dependence. Neste has been investigating the feasibility of a
pipeline linking Norway's offshore gas fields to Sweden and Finland, a
project whose future may now be in some doubt.
Gazprom, the world's largest gas producer, has a number of partnerships and
joint ventures in Austria, Germany, France and Italy.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Company News (This Week): Chemicals start to smell sweeter -
Bayer/BASF
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's recovering chemicals stocks are expected to be given a further
boost tomorrow when Bayer, star of the domestic sector, officially closes
its books for 1993.
Although Mr Manfred Schneider, chairman, has already as good as promised an
unchanged DM11 (Pounds 4.33) pay-out for the year, noting in January that
fourth quarter earnings and sales seemed better than expected, the market is
hungry for any snippets which support its view that the chemicals cycle is
out of the dumps.
If tomorrow's announcement, following a meeting of the supervisory board,
follows tradition, there will be little indication of progress in the
current year.
A clearer picture of present conditions and prospects can be expected on
Thursday and Friday, when BASF and Bayer host their annual press
conferences. BASF, which is considered the most sensitive of the German
chemicals groups to the vagaries of the cycle, last week unveiled a DM2 cut
to DM8 in its 1993 pay-out. But that had long been discounted by the
markets, and the news did nothing to affect the stock's recent sharp climb.
Hoechst, which meets the press a week tomorrow, has also proposed a DM7
dividend - down DM2, but better than many expected.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Motorola accord ends US sanctions threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan has narrowly averted US trade sanctions over its treatment of
Motorola, a leading US cellular phone company.
A deal reached after intense negotiations removes the immediate threat of
sanctions over US access to Japan's cellular phone market. But it could
create an unfortunate precedent by encouraging the Japanese government to
become closely involved in the affairs of private companies.
Washington, which used the case to signal its dissatisfaction with Tokyo's
progress in opening its markets, was due this week to publish a list of
likely targets for sanctions. The US has sought to put pressure on Japan to
accept quantifiable indicators of the openness of its markets.
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, brandished a Motorola cellphone
last month as he announced that Japan had breached a bilateral agreement.
The deal calls on the Japanese government to monitor investment by Japanese
cellular phone operator, IDO, in a cellular phone system promoted by
Motorola. The government should also allocate more radio frequency to the US
system. IDO agreed to quicken the pace of its investment in Motorola's
system.
The Japanese government also agreed to monitor IDO's progress in
implementing its plans at three-monthly intervals; to back low-interest
loans from the Japan Development Bank; to allow IDO to carry out its
investment and to review the situation if there was a request from either
party.
President Bill Clinton welcomed the breakthrough. But Japanese officials,
who have emphasised the importance of deregulating domestic industry, said
that such a deal was only possible in a sector where bureaucratic
involvement was still strong because of the need to allocate frequencies.
Japan's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications had sought to leave the
dispute in the hands of the two companies. But US pressure and the threat of
sanctions forced Tokyo to concede.
The deal calls for IDO to bring forward its investment in a further 159 base
stations for the Tacs cellular phones system, backed by Motorola, and
complete that investment by early autumn next year.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Split in right eases threat of S Africa poll boycott:
Popular Afrikaner leader to head moderate party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The threat of a widespread boycott of April's all-race elections in South
Africa was significantly lessened at the weekend after a split in the
rightwing Freedom Alliance.
The split was provoked by the crisis in the black 'homeland' of
Bophuthatswana, where a Pretoria-appointed administrator yesterday took over
from ousted President Lucas Mangope.
General Constand Viljoen, probably the most popular leader of right-wing
Afrikaners, said at the weekend he was resigning from the umbrella
right-wing group, the Afrikaner Volksfront, to lead a new moderate Afrikaner
party into the poll. The party, the Freedom Front, will field candidates
including members of the moderate wing of the divided ultra-right
Conservative party. Mr Ferdie Hartzenberg, CP leader, and hardline
Conservative members of the old white parliament still support a boycott.
Gen Viljoen's move marked a split with the neo-Nazi Afrikaner
Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistance Movement), whose members were
involved in gun battles on Friday in the streets of Bophuthatswana's twin
capitals, Mmabatho and Mafikeng, in which several blacks and right wing
whites were killed.
There was some confusion last night over whether Gen Viljoen might yet back
out of participating in the election. But the split with the AWB appeared to
be permanent. As a result the paramilitary movement is isolated.
Gen Viljoen's powerful ally in the Freedom Alliance, the Zulu-based Inkatha
Freedom party, said at the weekend it would not participate in elections.
However Inkatha's chief negotiator, Mr Frank Mdlalose, appeared to leave a
door open to participation when he said international mediation - the
subject of talks with the African National Congress, likely winner of the
election - might yield a positive result.
Gen Viljoen was due to meet Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Inkatha leader,
today for discussions. Although Inkatha failed to register a list of
candidates by the deadline last Friday, technically disqualifying it from
participating in the April poll, officials of the ANC said they would remove
such obstacles to Inkatha's participation provided a settlement of the
country's constitutional disputes was reached.
The third member of the Freedom Alliance, the government of Bophuthatswana,
in effect ceased to exist at the weekend when a South African administrator,
Mr Tjaart van der Walt, took over from Mr Mangope, who was ousted by a
combination of popular protest, a civil servants' strike, a security force
mutiny and the intervention of South African troops on Friday night.
Four people died in fighting near Durban yesterday after thousands of
Inkatha supporters blocked ANC rivals from holding a rally, state-run radio
reported.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Japan takes Pounds 1.7bn loss on gold coins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An ill-starred issue of gold coins, minted to honour former Emperor
Hirohito, has turned into a meltdown for the Japanese government -
financially as well as literally.
The finance ministry stands to lose about Y270bn (Pounds 1.72bn) on the sale
of 90 tonnes of gold obtained from melting down the coins, which were issued
in 1986 and 1987 to commemorate Hirohito's 60 years on the throne. Leading
traders say the loss is probably the largest any government has suffered
through a gold sale.
The coins have been dogged by controversy and scandal. They were issued with
a face value of Y100,000 each, but contained gold worth only half that.
The government initially seemed to have made a profit of about Y500bn, but
in 1990 Tokyo police claimed that counterfeit Hirohito coins were being
imported into Japan. The report caused so much uncertainty that many
Japanese sold their coins back to the Bank of Japan.
The 'melt value' of each coin has fallen to about Y25,000 because the
Japanese currency has strengthened and the gold price has fallen since they
were issued. As the Bank of Japan has had to redeem all returned coins at
face value, it could lose Y75,000 a coin.
The 90 tonnes of coins mentioned by the finance ministry last week is
equivalent to about 4.5m Hirohito coins, each containing 20 grams of gold,
according to gold dealers.
Mr Paul Davies, a British coin dealer from whom 3,200 allegedly counterfeit
coins were confiscated, repeated at the weekend his belief that the coins in
question were genuine. No charges have been brought against him. He is
pursuing court actions against the Japanese authorities, seeking the return
of the confiscated coins and asking for compensation. He expects the case to
take another two years.
The meltdown could affect sentiment in the gold market. Mr Andy Smith,
analyst at the Union Bank of Switzerland, said: 'The amount of gold is
insignificant and the market will easily absorb it. But the symbolism of
this is immeasurable in that we have the first gold sale from one of the
western world's principal gold hoarding nations.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Employing the appropriate hyperbole, the prospects for the advertising
industry seem absolutely fabulous. WPP has just reported a near-sevenfold
increase in annual pre-tax profits - admittedly from an extremely depressed
base - after its revenues grew 4 per cent in constant currency terms. Abbott
Mead Vickers, which is more heavily exposed to the UK market, has reported a
26 per cent increase in underlying trading profits. The Advertising
Association forecasts revenue will grow by 4 to 6 per cent in 1994 while
many more bullish predictions abound. Those rising revenues flowing over
trimmed cost bases should ensure rapid earnings growth and popping champagne
corks in many a West End bistro.
Sadly, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi is unlikely to share in the excitement when it
reports its results on Tuesday. Rumours of board room friction have dogged
the company. The remaining management time appears to have been absorbed in
its attempts to get its bloated cost base under control. Whether that has
proved successful will be revealed tomorrow, although the market has its
doubts. The bigger worry is that Saatchi has taken its eye off the trading
ball, shedding an embarrassing amount of market share. It warned in December
it would lose Pounds 30m of revenue in 1994 following the loss of accounts
with Chrysler and Helene Curtis. Saatchi has underperformed the market by 24
per cent over the past year when its rivals have substantially outperformed.
That calls for no more creative excuses but some concrete solutions instead.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After a deluge of information last year, water company shareholders are
suffering a drought. That unhappy situation is likely to continue until July
when Ofwat, the industry regulator, unveils companies' price limits for the
second half of the decade. Since the companies themselves will know Ofwat's
decision in May - and will have to distribute the figures internally for
planning purposes - the weeks running up to the official announcement are
likely to be especially choppy. Let's hope that the Stock Exchange's
watchdogs will be more than usually alert.
Capital spending plans for most water companies have been edging down as the
government has relaxed water quality targets. Since lower spending means
less borrowing, the companies might live comfortably with a tighter price
cap as a result. But the benefit has not been spread evenly. Thanks to its
peculiar geography, for example, Northumbrian Water's spending plans have
crept higher. There must be a chance that at least one of the water
companies will appeal to the Monopolies Commission.
A price cap which pushed interest cover close to two times might provoke
such an appeal, on the grounds that the company would be unable to raise
sufficient funding. Welsh Water's recent sterling bond included a cover
ratio of 1.5 times in its covenants. But lenders will demand greater
protection as water companies start to borrow in earnest. Whether Ofwat will
be prepared to give ground on this issue if faced with the threat of appeal
remains an open question.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The hunt for US inflationary demons will reach a peak of activity this week.
Producer and consumer price figures for February, followed by the monthly
report of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve, are likely to contain at least
one scrap of data to suggest that inflationary pressure is growing. That
points to another difficult week for US bonds, which on the basis of recent
experience would send ripples through European markets too.
True, bears of US Treasuries have had precious little real evidence to chew
on since Mr Alan Greenspan launched his pre-emptive strike on inflation by
raising short-term rates. But it is a measure of the heightened sensitivity
that indicators which would normally be given scant attention - such as the
National Association of Purchasing Managers price index and the Philadelphia
Fed report - have been thrust to centre stage. Besides, there is more to the
nervous state of the bond market than the immediate economic indicators.
Last week's tumble had more to do with President Clinton's growing
embarrassment over Whitewater, which is unlikely to be relieved quickly.
Politics aside, calm will only be restored when bond market investors have a
clearer view of Mr Greenspan's intentions from here on. That will probably
take either another rise in short-term rates - already priced into bond
yields - or evidence that the US economy has slowed decisively from the
heady growth rate achieved in the final quarter of last year. Until that
happens, US Treasuries remain in danger of being spooked by shadows.

FT  14 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: No call for rights
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One change in the UK equity market between this year and last is that while
rumours of rights issues have continued at full flood, the supply of new
paper has slowed to a trickle. The annual results season usually provides
cover for companies to pass the hat round. Yet so far this year the only
substantial issues have been from Burford to acquire some of Ladbroke's
property, and GKN in its attempt to snare Westland.
In part that, and some unexpectedly generous dividend increases, reflect the
improved financial position of companies. From a record financial deficit of
4 per cent of GDP five years ago the corporate sector has now moved back to
surplus. In 1993, more than Pounds 10bn was raised in rights money,
repairing balance sheets and forming a base for recovery. That additional
equity, retained earnings, and reductions in working capital are probably
sufficient to fund most internal needs. There may be some smaller issues
from the harder hit and struggling businesses which often bring up the rear
of the reporting season. But even here many of those companies which have
not already had one rights issue have had two.
Large-scale equity may still be raised to fund acquisitions. Returns on
capital have remained high through recession, and companies may view equity
raised at current ratings as cheap, even given the recent softness in the
market. Yet there is still great scepticism in boardrooms and institutions
about the wisdom of bids. Whatever else may depress investors, rights issues
are unlikely to slow equities down in 1994.

How sad that Standard Chartered, the international bank with a colourful -
if at times problematic - past, cannot rejoice in a bit of history.
Tucked away in the personal columns of last Saturday's Daily Telegraph is a
'BBWA Trunk Call': a call to arms, or at least drinks, to employees of the
Bank of British West Africa - former emblem, the elephant.
Founded 100 years ago this May by Elder Dempster shipping magnate AL Jones,
it remained the leading financial institution in British West Africa
throughout the colonial period before eventually being bought by Standard
Bank in 1965.
David Cox, who joined in 1957 in the leisurely days when duplicate bills of
exchange would arrive by sea a month or so after the air-mailed originals,
is hoping for around 300 guests at the shindig.
Tragically, the reunion takes place in the distinctly unnostalgic Hamilton
House pub by Liverpool Street station (named after Lord Hamilton, chairman
of the Great Eastern Railway, with no known connection to West Africa). For
there is no love lost with Standard Chartered - not a soul unconnected with
the original bank has been invited, even if Cox confesses to help from the
pensions department in tracing a few old-timers.

The latest development in the battle by Catalans to promote their
long-repressed language is the Catalan timepiece. And we're not talking
Salvador Dali floppy watches - surreal though it is.
Former shipping executive Francesc Ortiz has patented a Catalan watch-face.
He argues that conventional watch-faces numbering the hours from one to 12
reflect the Spanish, not the Catalan, way of telling the time.
To Catalan speakers 6.30 is 'two quarters of seven'; what Brits would call
'a quarter to seven' is actually 'three quarters of seven'; and 7.15 is 'a
quarter of eight'. So the new watches - ordered from a Swiss manufacturer -
feature the figures 1/4, 2/4 and 3/4 where you would expect to see 3, 6 and
9. All clear?
Ortiz, 35, then wants the Catalan-nationalist regional government to change
all public clocks to the same system. He evinces surprise that no-one has
thought of this before.

<TEXT>
Whatever versions of the truth politicians are expected to serve up to the
House of Commons, the role of John Major's Graham Bright is clear enough. As
parliamentary private secretary to the PM, his duty is to relay the concerns
of backbenchers, in pretty much unexpurgated form.
Which is why Major should take note of the growing unease at Westminster
that the 51-year-old MP for Luton South is adopting an imperious, dismissive
approach to his colleagues' worries.
Those who remember the last Tory leadership crisis are warning the boss not
to repeat Lady Thatcher's mistake - of listening too closely to her PPS
Peter Morrison and hence underestimating the strength of feeling on the
backbenches.

<TEXT>
How many prosperous English entrepreneurs ensconced in California would give
a microchip about the future of under-educated British youth? The Prince's
Youth Business Trust has found one in Jeremy White, who takes over as chief
executive next month.
John Pervin, who led the trust through its first successful decade of
helping under-privileged youngsters set up in business, was a career
Unilever man. White, 38, had a rather different start.
He may now boast an MBA, and an MA in education and psychology, but White
loathed school and, had it been around then, would undoubtedly have been a
candidate for PYBT funds when he started his electronic securities company
aged 20.
Within ten years he had merged with Britannia Security Group, at which point
he crossed to the US. After an acquisitions spree he sold his stake and
moved to California. There he bought Data Safe, a disaster-support business,
of which he is still chairman.
He inherits a charity that is basically in good shape - two thirds of its
charges are in business after two years, compared with a roughly one in ten
survival rate for new ventures across America.
For this, the new boss credits the system of attaching advisers to grant
recipients, but their wisdom is no substitute for training, and it is with
short, non-academic business management courses that White hopes to broaden
the trust's reach.
He certainly returns home unencumbered by his past life - six hours after
deciding to go for the job last November, his house was burnt to the ground.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Gridlock over London transport
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's Treasury has become the main obstacle to improving London's public
transport system. Last week Treasury ministers snubbed London Transport by
blocking the promotion of Mr Alan Watkins, deputy chairman and chief
executive, to the post of chairman. Transport ministers are understood to
have been happy with the appointment.
Mr Watkins' crime was to criticise the Chancellor Mr Kenneth Clarke for
providing insufficient funds in last November's Budget for London Transport
investment. Mr Watkins, a top executive at Hawker Siddeley before joining
London Transport 18 months ago, was admired for bringing private sector
skills to an organisation that is notoriously hard to manage. He has now
resigned. If ministers wish to attract talented outsiders to public jobs,
they will have to put up with blunt talking.
But the Treasury's downer on London Transport is not limited to its
treatment of Mr Watkins. Last month, it opposed a Pounds 500m deal to equip
the Northern Line with 100 new trains. Moreover, the government is only
proceeding with plans to build CrossRail, a Pounds 2bn east-west underground
railway, after the prime minister overruled objections from Mr Michael
Portillo, Treasury chief secretary. Even now, observers fear CrossRail could
founder as the Treasury has yet to promise funds.
Treasury attempts to curb government spending is perhaps understandable
given the enormous budget deficit. What is not sensible is that the Treasury
is also blocking initiatives by Londoners to find their own solutions to the
city's transport problems. In particular, it has rejected a scheme put to it
by London First, the business-led group, to earmark a portion of London's
business rates for transport investment.
Squalid
This is not good enough. The underground is squalid, unreliable and crowded.
Many people are therefore forced to travel by car so clogging the roads with
traffic and slowing down buses. This is not merely miserable for those
living and working in London. It also harms business and undermines the
City's competitiveness as a financial centre.
The total cost of modernising the underground and financing new projects
such as CrossRail is put at Pounds 17bn over 10 years. Given the difficulty
of providing cash from central government coffers, the Treasury should
welcome ideas to tap other sources.
The London First proposal would do just that. It would take advantage of the
fact that London's business rates are due to fall next year. Instead of
passing all the savings back to companies, a portion would be earmarked for
transport improvements and channelled through a trust. The trust would not
have to wait for the money to trickle in. It could issue bonds secured by
the future revenue stream.
Treasury theology
This idea has fallen foul of Treasury theology. The first objection is that
it would add to government spending and borrowing, as the scheme would be
underwritten by the state. But there would be no need for such a guarantee:
the flow of business rates would be security enough.
The second objection stems from the Treasury's dislike of hypothecation.
Treasury officials talk of the nation's tax take as 'our money'. If money is
earmarked for transport in London, the Treasury fears it will have to cut
spending on projects in other parts of Britain.
Not only is such description of the tax take as 'our money' presumptuous.
The idea that more investment in the capital's transport system must be
matched by cuts elsewhere is also bunkum. According to a recent estimate,
Londoners pay over Pounds 8bn a year more in taxes than is spent by
government in the city. They could maintain this relationship with the rest
of the UK and pay taxes earmarked for transport because such investment
would add value to its economy.
Not that the London First idea is perfect in every detail. Money should be
raised from domestic landowners and commuters as well as business: they too
would benefit from better transport. London First must also demonstrate that
London business enthusiastically backs such use of its money. That would be
the best way to overcome Treasury theology.

FT  14 MAR 94 / More does not mean merrier: Why the EU enlargement row has
spread into a dispute over the power balance in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The smart money is on a deal. But whatever the outcome of tomorrow's
emergency foreign ministers meeting in Brussels, the latest crisis over
enlargement of the European Union seems certain to have far-reaching
repercussions.
Much more than a few thousand tonnes of Norwegian fish is at stake. Either
through miscalculation or as a matter of principle, the UK has forced its EU
partners to confront the one issue which most would prefer to ignore: the
distribution of power in an expanded Union.
The resulting clash has pushed the enlargement talks to the brink of
collapse. Britain, and to a lesser extent Spain, stand accused of breaking
the pledge of the twelve to wrap up negotiations by early March so that
Sweden, Finland, Austria, and Norway can enter the Union by January 1 1995.
The row has exposed the faultlines in the Union which the Maastricht treaty
failed to close: between a rich north and a poorer south; between big and
small member states; between sovereignty-conscious countries such as the UK,
which hankers for a looser Union based on inter-governmental co-operation,
and federalists such as Belgium and the Netherlands which want faster
integration and streamlined decision-making.
Diplomats in Brussels remain baffled at the readiness of Mr John Major's
government to risk sacrificing enlargement, a policy which seemed central to
its aim of a wider Union. 'The British are playing politics at any price,'
said one German official, 'but this is a very dangerous game.'
There has always been a paradoxical element in plans to expand the Union.
Increasing the number of member states will, at some point, require a reform
of collective decision-making. Without such an overhaul, the Union risks
grinding to a halt, says Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator and the
senior British commissioner in Brussels.
Yet the basic cogs in the EU's machine have remained unchanged for 35 years,
in spite of a doubling of member states from six to 12. The number of
commissioners and official languages has crept up to 17 and nine
respectively, though some are visibly underemployed. Above all, the EU still
runs by a 'weighted voting' system, whereby the voice of the bigger
countries is reduced so as not to drown smaller neighbours.
At the Lisbon summit in June 1992, the 12 agreed that it was more important
to press ahead with enlargement than tinker with the institutional balance
of the Union. Leaders concluded that it was better to delay reforms until
the next batch of entrants, the central and east Europeans, Malta and
possibly Cyprus. At this point, it was agreed, reform of decision-making in
a union of 20-plus countries would become irresistible.
Crucially, the Lisbon summit understanding maintained the principle of the
'blocking minority', whereby a member state mustering sufficient support can
thwart the legislative intentions of its partners.
Until the latest British and Spanish interventions, it had been assumed that
the number of votes required to form a blocking minority would rise slightly
to take account of the four new members. Thus the current proposal is to
increase the present 23 votes out of a total of 76, to 27 votes out of an
expanded total of 90. The compromise maintains the proportion needed for a
blocking minority at roughly 30 per cent; but it has two big drawbacks:
First, the increase from 23 to 27 further distorts the relationship between
a country's voting strength and population. It would mean that a combination
of smaller states could technically outvote large states representing 40 per
cent of the population of the Union. 'This raises an important democratic
principle,' says a UK diplomat.
Second, the end of the 23-vote threshold would mean that two large countries
and one small country could no longer join forces to block measures. Spain,
fearful that enlargement will tilt the political gravity of the Union to the
north, wants to preserve the 23-vote threshold on core Mediterranean issues
such as agriculture.
British officials argue, too, that the power-sharing dispute is about vital
national interests. A recent survey of Whitehall departments, says one UK
official, suggested 'there was greater advantage in forming a blocking
minority rather than forming a qualified majority (needed to push decisions
through)'.
Where do the British believe they are most at risk in being outvoted? One
answer is trade policy, where the UK has traditionally led a blocking
minority of free-traders including Germany, the Netherlands and sometimes
Denmark against a protectionist camp led by France and Spain.
Yet the line-up on such issues is far from clear: Germany wobbled during
last year's General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations to appease
the French government over protection for agriculture; but the entry of the
Scandinavians ought technically to strengthen the free-trading club in the
Union.
Other British arguments on the blocking minority risk sounding defeatist.
Officials fret about the threat of being outmanoeuvred on social policy. But
this suggests that the much-vaunted opt-out of the social charter which Mr
Major secured during the Maastricht negotiations, may not be as effective as
first thought. It underlines, too, how the prime minister's vulnerability at
home is affecting British negotiating tactics in Brussels.
UK officials confirm there was a 'political calculation' in London that a
change in the blocking minority could provoke a revolt by Tory
Euro-sceptics. There were worries about a split in the party ahead of the
European parliamentary elections in June in which the Conservatives are
expected to suffer heavy losses, possibly provoking a leadership challenge
to Mr Major in the autumn.
Yet diplomats agree that Britain's stand on the blocking minority may have
the perverse effect of arousing the Tory right: an arcane Euro-squabble has
been elevated into a cause celebre, making a climb-down this week or next
harder than it might have been.
Virtually none of these arguments impress Britain's European partners.
Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands are upset that the UK seems oblivious
to the risk that the European parliament will block the enlargement
agreements if the voting weights are not adjusted. Chancellor Helmut Kohl is
said to be crestfallen at Mr Major's equivocation on enlargement. German
officials complain that the Chancellor has had no reward for standing by Mr
Major during ratification of the Maastricht treaty, or for agreeing in 1992
to extend the British budgetary rebate to 1999, a concession worth almost
Pounds 2bn a year.
German nervousness is compounded by Britain's argument that voting weights
need to take greater account of the size of population. The logic points to
Germany, with 80m people, moving up from 10 to 15 votes; but this would end
the voting parity between France and Germany, undermining the Franco-German
partnership which in the post war period has depended on a delicate balance
of political power.
The more conspiratorially-minded believe weakening the Paris-Bonn axis is
Britain's 'great game' in Europe. French officials routinely state that the
UK aim in freezing voting weights at their present level is to paralyse
decision-making inside the Union and create a 'wider Europe' which is little
more than a free trade area. 'Major is trying to bring back Maggie's
Europe,' says one senior Brussels diplomat.
None of this may be true. It is possible that the British are simply putting
down a marker ahead of the 1996 inter-governmental conference to review the
operation of the Maastricht treaty, signalling that they intend to protect
vigorously the interests of the larger member states in an expanded Union.
But the risk is that if sufficient numbers of Mr Major's EU partners believe
the opposite, they may well be tempted to move faster toward integration. He
would then face the choice he is desperate to avoid: splitting his Tory
party or swimming with the continental tide.

FT  14 MAR 94 / A misguided focus on job creation - America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 'jobs conference' convened in Detroit by President Bill Clinton should
really be called a 'wages conference' or perhaps even an 'inequality
conference'. Provided wages are flexible there is no reason why jobs should
be permanently in short supply in a market economy.
If simply 'having a job' were all that mattered, people would work for
practically nothing. If necessary they would secure jobs by offering to pay
employers to hire them. We do not observe the absurdity of negative wages,
of course, because what is really at stake is not employment but the income
that can be derived from it. Quite rightly, people will take jobs only if
wages more than compensate for the unpleasantness (or 'disutility') of
working, taking into account all other means of sustenance.
While conceding that the unemployed individual can perhaps price himself
into work, some economists claim this option is not generally available.
Following Keynes, they stress employees' dual role as buyers of goods and
services as well as inputs in the productive process. If all wages were cut,
the argument runs, consumers' purchasing power would fall, putting downward
pressure on product prices. So real, or inflation adjusted, wages might not
decline.
This is an ingenious but ultimately unconvincing objection. A fall in wages
would cause a shift in the composition of demand, with increased purchases
by foreigners, companies and individuals not reliant on wage income. Falling
prices would also boost demand by increasing the value of assets such as
bonds and bank deposits. The classical conclusion thus stands: in the
absence of artificial constraints, unemployment is voluntary because it
reflects people's reluctance to accept jobs at the wages offered.
The diverse jobs record of the US and the European Union amply supports this
unpopular proposition. In Europe strong unions and restrictive legislation
have stunted job creation by putting a floor under wages. At the same time
relatively generous social benefits have created a viable alternative to
work for many adults. In the US both sets of forces have been weaker: there
are fewer benefits and wages are more flexible. It is thus hardly surprising
that the EU jobless rate has risen steadily and now seems stuck in double
digits while the US rate, currently 6.5 per cent, has increased only
slightly in recent decades.
Yet the domestic unpopularity of the US approach shows that people care not
about jobs per se but about the quality of jobs - the standard of living
they buy. Middle class families are frustrated by the slow growth of
earnings - an inevitable consequence of the enormously rapid growth of
employment required to absorb the baby-boom generation. And in urban
ghettos, many adult men (especially minorities) have refused to take dead
end jobs, opting instead to withdraw from the formal labour market. The
lesson is that while market forces can create jobs for all who want them,
they cannot be relied upon to create jobs that meet people's aspirations or
even that pay enough to lift low-skilled workers above subjective measures
of 'poverty'.
Meeting people's aspirations is an especially formidable task because they
depend largely on relative rather than absolute living standards. What is
regarded as a 'good' wage is largely dependent on what others are earning.
Poverty is a notoriously relative concept. In modern America many poor
families have cars, colour televisions, videos and air conditioning. They
live well by the standards both of their forebears and of the middle classes
in nations such as India or China. Yet they feel abused because their
lifestyles compare adversely to those of affluent Americans.
If a consensus emerges at Detroit, it is likely to be that industrial
countries can create more 'quality' jobs by taking steps to raise the skills
and hence productivity of low paid workers. There is likely to be a strong
emphasis on the need for more effective education and training, especially
for the bottom half of the ability range. This is an admirable policy, but
it would be a mistake to regard it as a solution to present problems.
Differences in ability are so great that better training for the low paid
will only have a limited impact on disparities in the productivity (and
hence earnings) of various social groups within society.
As overall living standards rise, so will the minimum requirements for life
above the poverty line and the wage at which work is regarded as dignified.
If social benefits are raised in line with growing affluence, unemployment
will remain high (as it has in the EU in past decades) because many will
find that work does not pay. If social benefits are held down and wages kept
flexible (as has happened in the US), the number of working 'poor' will
multiply. Either way the conscience of society will be pricked.
At its roots, the problem of unemployment, or its alternative manifestation
as 'low quality' jobs, reflects a fundamental feature of the market system:
the fact that it rewards individual effort and ability and so generates
grossly unequal outcomes.
The way to come to terms with economic inequality is to recognise that the
market system is not something that governments either created or can
manipulate with impunity. Markets are sets of unplanned spontaneous
exchanges; nobody plans the inequality and nobody is responsible for it.
Inequality is simply the price we pay for a general level of prosperity
unimaginable under any other economic system.

<TEXT>
Mr John Major's government is lurching towards another pothole. The foreign
secretary, long regarded as the cabinet's 'safe pair of hands', has landed
Mr Major with a new political drama which again threatens to divide his
party.
The enlargement of the European Union to admit Austria, Norway, Finland and
Sweden was not a purely British idea. But Mr Major had pushed it, especially
during the UK presidency in 1992, against the reticence if not outright
opposition of several other member states, and had insisted on giving it
priority over various other tasks, including notably the reform of the EU's
decision-making process.
Two weeks ago this policy appeared close to a deserved success. After hard
negotiations, agreements with three of the applicants were concluded, and
that with Norway appeared very close. Yet now the whole enterprise is in
jeopardy because the UK, of all countries, is pressing for a change in the
qualified majority voting system - reducing the 'blocking minority' in the
EU council from 30 to 25 per cent.
Of course, that is not how the British government presents the matter. By
stressing the absolute number of votes, as opposed to the percentage, it
poses as defender of the status quo against yet another onslaught by
wild-eyed continental federalists. At present, says Mr Douglas Hurd, two
large states and one small one form a blocking minority, and that must
remain the case even when there are 16 member states altogether.
Trumpet call
By putting it like that he gets the worst of all worlds. Eurosceptic Tory
backbenchers have been roused by his anti-federalist trumpet call, so that
the government cannot now accept the obvious and rational solution to the
problem - which is to keep the percentage as it is until the whole matter is
reviewed at the Maastricht revision conference in 1996 - without provoking
yet another crisis over Europe within the Conservative party. So far from
showing a safe pair of hands, Mr Hurd has used his left hand to sabotage the
efforts of his right, with which he has been trying to hold the party
together on Europe as the European elections approach.
At the same time he has yet again presented his EU partners with the image
of Britain as a negative, obstructive force, bent on blocking any kind of
reform or advance, even one which it purports to favour. If he does not back
down the result will be either to abort the enlargement process altogether -
if the European parliament goes through with its threatened veto - or to
make enlargement a prescription for even greater paralysis in EU
decision-making, as the majority required for a decision will be greater
than before.
Voting weights
Moreover, he has argued his case in such a way as to bring forward the issue
of the relationship between voting weights and population. Small states are
over-represented in the present system, for a reason that should command the
British government's sympathy: the EU is an association of sovereign states,
not a federation. Yet the British foreign office has been hinting that it
might accept a compromise whereby the 'blocking minority' would vary
according to the combined population of the states composing it.
Such a solution would be a significant step towards federalism, since it
would amount to saying that the Union is composed of individual citizens -
who should be equally represented in its institutions on the basis of one
person, one vote - rather than of states with equal sovereign rights
irrespective of their population.
That federalist principle is already acknowledged in the fact that small and
large states have different voting weights. But the more precisely voting
weights are aligned with population, the stronger the federal character of
the Union becomes, and the weaker the sovereignty of the member states. The
Germans, who as the state with the largest population stand to benefit most
from such a reform, have none the less held back from pushing it: they can
see the danger of invoking their superior numbers as a reason for having
more influence in the Union than the French.
But Britain's gallant defenders of national sovereignty have blundered in
where German federalists feared to tread.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Commercial leases costly for UK
retail businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER J BAGULEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In the letter 'No foul play over rent reviews for commercial
properties' (February 25), Mr William McKee referred to research undertaken
by the British Property Federation which concluded that there is no evidence
that the upwards-only rent review provision in commercial leases has exerted
inflationary pressures on occupational rents.
This is misleading and contrary to our own research, which employed a
similar methodology, but was tailored specifically to the retail property
market:
The retail rental value index has been at a higher level than the index of
'high street' retail price inflation (measured using the retail sales
deflator) in just under half of the last 22 years.
This upward inflationary pressure in the retail property market has not been
compensated for by downward pressure during periods of relatively low
inflation, for example the late 1970s and early 1980s. The rapid rise in
retail rents during the late 1980s more than covered the lower rental growth
(relative to price inflation) during the period 1975-1986.
On average, retailers in the last 22 years would be paying 9 per cent more
rent under a conventional lease with UORR, compared with the rent which
would be payable under a regime of annual inflation-indexed (ie linked to
retail sales inflation) leases. For leases agreed during the period
1975-1987, this proportion rises to 20 per cent, peaking at 26 per cent in
1977.
In summary, our evidence indicates that the structure of the institutional
lease has resulted in the majority of retail businesses in the UK paying
more rent than they can afford to cover through price inflation.
With the prospect of a low inflation decade, this is likely to inhibit
expansion by retailers which, in turn, could impact on a national economy
placing reliance on consumer expenditure to lead the recovery.
There is, however, one important area where our views depart from those of
Mr V A G Tregear (Letters: 'Outlaw upwards-only provisions on commercial
rents', February 9). In common with the BPF, the Boots Group, in its
response to the government's consultation paper on the commercial lease
structure, has argued for non-intervention.
Nevertheless, we firmly believe that the property market must face up to its
own inherent inefficiencies and work towards achieving greater flexibility,
as any market should.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Shocked, shaken but surviving: Patti Waldmeir says the
battle of Bophuthatswana has led to a realignment in South Africa's politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When a lone black soldier turned his rifle on two wounded rightwing whites
lying in the blood and dust of a Bophuthatswana street on Friday, and pulled
the trigger to execute them, South Africa reached a turning point.
With any luck, that gruesome incident - the first time in recent South
African history that the armed white right has confronted blacks and come
out the loser - will turn the tide of events in a positive direction. Anyone
who saw the terrified faces of the two wounded men as they begged for mercy,
anyone who watched as truckloads of the racist white fled Bophuthatswana
with black soldiers in furious pursuit, cannot doubt that the right was
dealt a salutary shock when its lunatic foray into Bophuthatswana ended in
humiliation.
There are already signs that the shock has sent at least some rightwing
leaders scurrying to their senses: General Constand Viljoen, the Afrikaner
leader who despatched rightwing 'troops' to the homeland in the first place,
said the homeland fiasco had provoked him to drop his plans to boycott
April's all-race elections. At midnight on Friday night, he submitted a list
of candidates to fight the election under the banner of the Freedom Front, a
party created by him to pursue the demand for an Afrikaner homeland via the
ballot box.
By yesterday afternoon, his commitment to electoral participation appeared
to be wavering, with his close ally, Mr Rowan Cronje, foreign minister of
Bophuthatswana, saying Gen Viljoen was reconsidering his position. But
whatever he decides, the Bophuthatswana episode appears to have provoked a
split in the right wing which cannot be healed, leaving the neo-Nazi leader
Eugene Terreblanche and the white supremacist Ferdi Hartzenberg, leader of
the ultra-right Conservative Party - the real villains of the battle of
Bophuthatswana - isolated from the mass of rightwing Afrikaners, who may be
frightened, perhaps even racist, but who recoil at racial confrontation.
Such a split must be good news for South Africa's election prospects, for it
will weaken the case for violent struggle and give ordinary Afrikaners an
electoral outlet for their fears and a constitutional means of demonstrating
whether there is widespread support for a 'volkstaat' (an Afrikaner
homeland). But the split could hold as much threat as promise: for the
paramilitary right has been held in check, at least partially, through Mr
Terreblanche's alliance with Gen Viljoen, an alliance which now appears
irrevocably ended.
Marginalised by the new politics of the right, and enraged by the execution
of rightwing whites by blacks in Bophuthatswana, Mr Terreblanche's AWB could
prove more rather than less dangerous. Of the many snapshots of horror
provided by last week's events in Mmabatho and its twin city, Mafikeng, the
most shocking image was of black bodies slumped in the streets of Mafikeng,
killed by whites who drew fire in their turn from black troops and police.
As a black South African television cameraman said at the time: 'the race
war has begun'.
African National Congress leader Popo Molefe, candidate for premier of the
new Northwest province which includes Bophuthatswana, appeared to endorse
the killing of whites, saying that the execution 'leaves me cold', repeating
the comment made by Minister of Police Jimmy Kruger nearly 20 years ago,
that the death of black liberation leader Steve Biko left him, similarly,
'cold'. South Africans must hope that the turning point reached on Friday
was the beginning of the end of the extreme white right, rather than the
start of a new racial conflict.
South African newspapers were quick to declare yesterday that the battle of
Bop marked the definitive defeat of the paramilitary right. Unfortunately,
events do not bear that out: the whites who invaded Bophuthatswana in the
dark of Thursday night left in confusion and humiliation on Friday; but they
were not routed. Most withdrew under orders from their commander, Gen
Viljoen, without ever entering the capital; some 3,000 spent the day at an
air base several kilometres from Mmabatho, and withdrew under escort of
South African troops, after Bophuthatswana president Lucas Mangope (since
removed from office) asked Gen Viljoen to send them home. Those chased
through the streets of Mafikeng by black troops were a minority.
What the white right learned at Mmabatho was that it could not take on an
army - whether the 3,500 strong Bophuthatswana Defence Force, or the far
more powerful South African Army. But largely, they knew that already;
direct confrontation between rightwing and loyal South African armies was
never the main threat to the country's transition. Small groups of fanatic
rightwingers engaged in sabotage and terrorism posed the greatest danger;
they still do. The battle of Bop may have deflated the bravado of the right,
but it has not removed the menace.
Still, Gen Viljoen's defection to the political centre (assuming he does not
reverse it in coming weeks) will strengthen the critical mass of parties
accepting the new constitution, and broaden the legitimacy of the election.
One major party - arguably the most important of the dissenters, the
Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi - remains
publicly committed to boycotting the election. ANC leaders are hoping that
Chief Buthelezi will suffer the same fate as President Mangope: a civil
servants' revolt, coupled with police mutiny, toppling him from power. For
the moment, this seems unlikely.
But Gen Viljoen's decision to stand for election has split not only the
white right, but the whole of the rightwing Freedom Alliance, which used to
include Inkatha, Viljoen's Afrikaner Volksfront and the Bophuthatswana
government. Now the Bop government has been removed from power, the
Afrikaner Volksfront is disintegrating after Gen Viljoen's resignation to
head the new party (the Freedom Front), only Inkatha is left boycotting the
election.
The threat of countrywide disruption had been based on the fact that the
white right is distributed throughout South Africa, while Inkatha's
influence is localised. The weekend's events must undermine the geographical
scope of a boycott outside Inkatha's heartland of Natal province, and
certain townships of the East Rand near Johannesburg. But Natal is the
country's most populous province, and disrupted elections there would
seriously undermine the result's legitimacy.
The lesson of the past few months of negotiations has been that no breakdown
is ever, quite, final. Time is short, Inkatha is still protesting loudly
that it will resist the poll, and April's ballots are already being printed.
But the ANC still holds out hope that Inkatha will make a late decision to
enter the poll.
The battle of Bop has generated a realignment in South African politics; but
if the scene has been shaken up, it has not yet settled down. Today, Gen
Viljoen is due to meet Chief Buthelezi for what could prove another decisive
showdown. Perhaps the white right will persuade black conservatives to
accept elections; perhaps the opposite will be true. For the moment, the
situation in South Africa remains, as it has been for months, fluid. If
anything, the recent dramatic events may have made the perilous transition
to democracy slightly easier.

UK Nasdaq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr EDMOND JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Ronald Cohen and Sir Andrew Hugh Smith present contrasting views on the
merits of a separate smaller companies stock market (Personal View: March
8).
What do private investors - key buyers of growth stocks - think on this
longstanding issue?
Having watched the rise and demise of 1980s Over-The-Counter and Third
Markets, I recall more wealthy share promoters than investors who backed
fledgling issues.
Standards of disclosure outside the London Stock Exchange were appalling.
Sir Hugh's concern for quality reporting is therefore imperative. Shouldn't
investors have 'information rights' to glean most of what is required to
value shares from the financial statements?
Mr Cohen doesn't even mention disclosure, and as a venture capitalist he
must ensure a market for his seedcorn investments.
Buyers beware.
But the London Stock Exchange hardly champions investors outside City
circles. Representatives of its member firms have privileged access to
company results briefings, where the future is evaluated and quickly
factored into share prices.
'Sid' has no access to these meetings, and is also disadvantaged by smaller
company share placings which favour institutional investors. Even in a major
offer for sale, individuals typically receive a prospectus only 48 hours
before the applications deadline - with insufficient time for consideration.
If Mr Cohen's proposed 'UK Nasdaq' will radically reform new issues for
private investor participation, list detailed company announcements on TV
Ceefax and uphold reporting standards, it could win strong public support.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Rome was not rebuilt in a day: Italy's confusing electoral
reforms are likely to produce further muddle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW GOWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The politicians who campaigned successfully a year ago for a fundamental
change in Italy's voting laws promised a lot. Moving from the previous,
hideously complex system of proportional representation towards a
first-past-the-post approach more akin to that of the UK would, they
claimed, generate more transparent and straightforward elections, present
voters with clearer choices and even produce stabler and more legitimate
governing majorities.
Unfortunately, although the voters signalled in large numbers that they
wanted all these things in last April's referendum, they look like being
cruelly disappointed. The campaign for the election due on March 27 has
created neither transparency nor straightforwardness, the choices involved
are about as obscure as ever in Italian politics, and the outcome could well
be something to which Italians have become all too accustomed in the past 45
years: an almighty muddle.
The confusion can only complicate the task of any new Italian government in
dealing with political challenges and economic constraints that remain more
awkward than those facing any other major western European country.
Electoral reform, of course, was never going to be a panacea for the
manifold ills afflicting Italy's body politic following the collapse of the
corrupt old order dominated by the Christian Democrat party. Under that
system, the politicians - competing on centrally chosen party lists - traded
votes for patronage, and the result was an endless succession of governments
comprising the same parties and faces.
But reform was supposed to hasten the construction of a new order, in part
by reducing the number of small parties scrambling for a slice of power and
by encouraging the formation of larger political groupings whose candidates
would compete for single-seat constituencies on the basis of distinct policy
programmes.
That is not quite how things have turned out. Thanks largely to a provision
in the electoral law, allowing for 25 per cent of the seats in the lower
house and senate to be elected by proportional representation and party
lists, the small parties are alive and well and insistently clinging to
their separate identities.
In order to maximise their votes in the single-seat constituencies,
individual parties of the left, right and centre have banded together in
alliances. But these groupings remain flimsy in the extreme, their members
united by political slogans but divided on important policy issues, riven
with personality clashes, and to some extent vying with one another as well
as with the opposing alliances for votes. It is hard to see any of them
surviving long after the election, let alone forming the basis for stable
government.
On the left, such are the differences within the Progressive Alliance
between the mainstream of the former communist party and a breakaway
hardline faction that the alliance's overall leader, Mr Achille Occhetto,
spends more of his time repudiating the extreme comments of some of his
colleagues than in explaining his party's programme.
The forces of the right, grouped around media mogul Silvio Berlusconi's
Forza Italia movement, are leading in the polls, but largely by virtue of
disguising their differences behind a vapid, presidential-style campaign
focused on the personality of Mr Berlusconi. Serious policy discussion has
been conspicuously absent.
Small wonder that the voters are confused, or that pressure is growing for
another bout of electoral reform. Not only do they face the disappearance of
any familiar element in the landscape (almost all the parties have changed
their names to distance themselves from the past, and several have split
into even smaller fragments). They are also being asked to vote, on three
separate ballots, in a system that is neither fish nor fowl - neither PR nor
first-past-the-post - and in ignorance as to how the candidates of their
choice will ultimately be aligned or what sort of government might result.
It is scarcely a climate designed to foster responsible or coherent postures
by the politicians themselves. Front runner Mr Berlusconi, in particular,
has been shamelessly promising tax cuts and new jobs. No serious observer
expects him to be able to deliver these without severely damaging Italy's
painstaking efforts to reduce its budget deficit and bring its spiralling
government debt under control. He has also consistently refused to subject
his platform to proper scrutiny by debating on TV with his opponents.
The latter are putting their trust not in achieving outright victory (the
polls give them few grounds for hope on that score) but in the idea that
forces of the centre, moderate left and moderate right will, after the
election, combine to back a pragmatic 'institutional' coalition that can put
politics aside and get on with governing. For Italy's establishment,
smoke-filled rooms and massaged results still seem more comfortable than a
straight political fight.
What the country badly needs is a stable government capable of matching up
to its status as the world's fifth largest industrial power and getting to
grips with its economic problems. Ironically, the closest it has come to
that state of grace in recent decades is probably with the technocratic
governments born out of the comprehensive discrediting of the political
class in the last two years. The current election campaign shows how far
Italy still has to go before it creates a political system that can be
relied on to produce such a government at the ballot box.

Sir, Klaus Kinkel was quite right to state that the UK position on qualified
majority voting in an enlarged Community is unacceptable to the European
Parliament and that the latter would reject any such solution ('Vote dispute
threatens EU expansion', March 9).
The reasons are simple: the UK position would render decision-taking in the
EU even more difficult than at present. Citizens of all 16 member states
have a right to expect the EU to be capable of taking decisions in those
areas where it holds responsibilities. The UK position is a recipe for more
paralysis in the EU. The European Parliament will certainly stick to its
guns.

Sir, I recall the legendary island populated only by knights, who always

perhaps a parliamentary question which would do the job?

FT  14 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Scottish salmon also subsidised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RODERICK THOMAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to your editorial comment 'Salmon wars' (March 10). While it is
no doubt true that the Norwegian salmon industry has received considerable
state aid, the same must also be said of the Scottish industry.
Since the late 1970s Scottish salmon farming companies have received UK and
EU direct aid in the form of grants, interest relief subsidies and cheap
loans; in certain cases direct aid has exceeded 50 per cent of the start-up
costs of Scottish salmon farming ventures.
In addition the Scottish (and Irish) industries are protected by an import
tariff of 2 per cent which is significant in such a low margin business.
The real problem is that Norway enjoys several fundamental advantages over
Scotland: in general, sites are more sheltered and less prone to storm
damage; the temperature and day length regimes engender faster growth and a
lower incidence of disease; the size of farms is strictly limited by the
licensing authorities and as such Norway has not suffered some of the
appalling diseconomies of scale witnessed at large units in Scotland where
disease has resulted in drastic losses.
Without the benefit of state aid the efficient family-operated, medium-sized
Norwegian salmon farm is profitable at an average price which is perhaps
20-30 per cent below the stated average cost of production in Scotland.
The real worry now is not Norway but Chile: its nascent, fast-growing
industry is producing salmon even more cheaply than Norway.
Whether Norwegian salmon is excluded from the EU or not, international
competition in the maturing salmon market is going to intensify.
In the long term, salmon prices are unlikely to recover.

You might have thought that a dramatisation of a Sherlock Holmes short story
and an episode in a documentary series about life today in a Chinese country
town would have little in common. Actually the theme is precisely the same
in both: opium addiction. Both run from 9.00 until 10.00 so if you want to
compare and contrast you will have to use a video recorder.
In The Memoirs Of Sherlock Holmes (ITV) our hero (who is, of course, not
averse to narcotics himself) investigates the opium dens of Rotherhithe.
Phil Agland's documentary Beyond The Clouds (C4) looks at the way that
today's form of opium - heroin - is pouring into southern China, with the
town of Lijiang on the front line.
Horizon explains how the workings of a car radiator led a scientist to a new
theory about why humans walk upright: it is all to do with the need to keep
thinking machines (computers/brains) cool (BBC2 8.00). BBC1 launches yet
another new comedy series: Men Of The World stars David Threlfall (forever
Smike from 'Nicholas Nickleby' in my mind) as a travel agent (8.30).

FT  14 MAR 94 / Arts: Rattle's music of political upheaval - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 'Towards the Millennium' music project, instigated by Simon Rattle, is
gaining new allies. As it progresses decade by decade on its exploration of
the 20th century, the BBC Symphony Orchestra and the Nash Ensemble have
joined the musical line-up, while coverage of the other arts has expanded to
take in literature, education and environmental artists.
Perhaps the lure of the 1930s for this year's programme was just too great.
That was the decade in which music became caught up in momentous political
upheaval and reflected world affairs more urgently than at any time before.
Barely any European composer remained unaffected. Some (Bartok and
Schoenberg) were uprooted from their home countries. Others wrote openly
(Britten and Tippett) or ambiguously (Shostakovich) in protest.
The stockmarkets may have crashed, but in the world of music there was no
depression, no slump, no sign of artistic energy lying untapped. For Rattle
the choice was almost impossibly wide, given the number of strong
personalities clamouring for inclusion. By and large he has not tried to
group the composers in schools or nationalities. The City of Birmingham
Symphony Orchestra's concerts simply bring together acknowledged
masterpieces in balanced programmes.
It may come as a surprise to realise how central a place the music of the
1930s plays in our concert-life. Almost all the music in Rattle's series is
familiar, bar a couple of the short Gershwin pieces and Stravinsky's
Persephone, which is not heard that often. In Thursday's concert there was
also Varese's Ionisation, a five-minute display of percussion which has
acquired rarity value on account of asking for 13 players on 40 different
instruments.
The two main works called for equally large orchestral forces. In Berg's
Violin Concerto, representative of the Austro-German tradition, the soloist
was Gidon Kremer. He was not relaxed and deep-toned in the music like
Anne-Sophie Mutter at the Proms, but wiry, nervously introspective, the
tension coiled tight within. In the closing pages he could hardly have
played more quietly and it was a shame that the CBSO could not match his
hushed eloquence. Unwanted strands of the orchestral accompaniment kept
protruding at the wrong moments.
Although it does not carry any specific agenda, Shostakovich's Fourth
Symphony is one of the key political works of the decade, withdrawn before
its first performance in fear of Stalin's disapproval. No wonder, when its
music is nearly anarchic, setting out to break the symphonic status quo. The
programme-note talked of a mechanical element, but Rattle was anything but
mechanical. In his hands passages of sadness and longing, of humour and
sincerity appeared alongside the sarcasm and savagery. The CBSO was on
sharper form here. A performance of this symphony should always be
shattering and this one was no exception.

Millennium' on March 16, 17, 20 and 25

FT  14 MAR 94 / Arts: A lifeline for the South Bank - The rebuilding of
London's riverside arts centre must be uncompromising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For three shillings and sixpence in 1951 it was possible to buy A Pocket
Guide to Modern Buildings in London by Ian McCallum, who was then the editor
of the Architectural Review. In this elegant little guide book the author
wrote about the buildings of the Festival of Britain beside the Thames.
'On the South Bank particularly can be shown how brilliance, colour, drama,
surprise and even prettiness are fully within the range of modern
architecture, for so long considered proficient only in the limited field of
austere puritanism. For the public this means not only light and warmth but
a way of life that has once again some glamour in it - green things,
pleasant textures, colours, vistas, urbanities which were once the
perquisite of privilege.'
How wrong can you be? The philosophy that informed the Festival of Britain
was supposed to extend to the permanent development of the South Bank site
once the exhibition buildings had gone and only the Festival Hall remained.
Today the South Bank remains untouched by urbanity and, to a large degree,
ruthlessly ugly. Although the Royal Festival Hall does remain a distinctive
modern building of some quality, there is little else of any merit on the
site.
Last week I walked around the whole of the 27 acres, which comes under the
control of the South Bank Board, with Nicholas Snowman, the board's chief
executive.
The Board has decided under its recently appointed chairman, Sir Brian Corby
(chairman of The Prudential), to hold an international competition to find a
master planner for the long overdue transformation of the site. My walkabout
was a grim experience not unlike a tour of a part of a city that had been
partly destroyed in a war and then occupied by a motley group of tramps and
culture vultures.
We started our walk by Waterloo station where in a few months the first of
the anticipated 15m annual visitors from Europe will emerge from their
Channel Tunnel experience. Will they notice any difference as they burrow
beneath the railway arches (some of them blitzed or occupied by tramps) and
struggle to reach a glimpse of the river? At present it is impossible from
ground level to find your way with ease to any of the cultural destinations.
If you stray too far you may well find yourself in the 'cardboard city' of
the homeless that still disgraces the huge sunken traffic island near
Waterloo Bridge. Once you get near to the foothills of the Hayward Gallery,
the only real hope you have of reaching the light is by climbing what look
like concrete fire escapes leading to the concrete uplands of the world of
the walkways. As far as I know no one finds this environment acceptable.
Access is confusing and the quality of the public spaces is visually
repellent.
It is worth dwelling for a while on the merits of the three main cultural
buildings. First of all the Royal Festival Hall - she sits amidst all this
concrete squalor like some faded starlet who has seen better days. She has
had her make-up renewed and one or two transplants so that she can keep that
air of 1950s refinement and slight apartness from her cruder neighbours. I
think people like the old girl because she is not aggressively modern and
has a definite sense of style and lightness. Nowadays she has to carry the
burden of being a Grade I listed building - and it is encouraging that her
owners see her virtues and are trying to remove some of the detritus of
commerce that litters the spacious foyers and detracts from the sense of
transparency and light that makes it an intriguing and festive building by
day and at night.
Then there are the two ugly sisters - the Hayward Gallery and the Queen
Elizabeth Hall. They never got to the ball in 1951 because they were born
too late. The tragedy is that they were not aborted. As architecture, they
are not only without distinction but they are a product of the 1960s when a
cell of LCC/GLC architects thought it was clever and avant-garde to insult
both the city and the public by the erection of monsters. The present regime
at the South Bank Board and their immediate predecessors seem prepared to
tread the path of mere expediency. They feel they have to try to do
something to improve these horror buildings simply because they are there.
There is only one solution to humanise that part of the South Bank and that
is to destroy these vile creatures of the 1960s by demolition. Only then can
the true value of the site be appreciated again and only then can a master
plan of any real civic value be achieved.
Today is the last day for any architect, designer or urban planner in the
world to submit his two sheets of A4 paper about 'the role of cultural
centres in the 21st century'. Their names will be vetted by a pretty
sinister committee of taste that comprises eight people - four of them part
of the South Bank Centre; three architects and an artist. The architects are
Eldred Evans (designer with her husband of the St. Ives Tate Gallery); Alan
Stanton, a good exhibition designer who is currently sadly wrecking the
Ashmolean in Oxford; and the amusing and possibly liveliest member of the
group, Christian de Portzamparc, a chic favourite of Parisian architectural
circles. The artist is an inevitable Turner Prizewinner - Anish Kapoor. I
pin my hopes for a sane solution upon the down to earth skills of Sir Brian
Corby.
Ten names will be chosen to go ahead and be given the full brief, and by the
middle of August three shortlisted 'winners' will have produced their
schemes for our delectation. Will the public have any involvement? These
decisions are too important to be left to an artistic clique.
I do not feel that the South Bank Board realises that so much of the site
has to be completely rethought. The monsters have to be taken away to some
Jurassic Park for architectural relics and a major town planning exercise
must be carried out that involves the whole capital city.
New bridges, new Tate Galleries, new sport facilities, and above all new
landscaping and new thinking about cultural ghettos are essential if some
feeble compromise of expediency is to be avoided. The proposed budget is
almost pathetically inadequate - of course you can improve things for Pounds
50m over five years but there is a real danger that British compromise and
philistine parsimony will produce a result that lacks real vision and
architectural quality. Something more than a few gestures are needed in this
graveyard of brutalism.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Arts: Glorious Lulu - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nothing less than a sensational performance can do justice to Alban Berg's
great opera Lulu, for it is an intrinsically sensational work. So much so,
as you may remember, that his widow Helene did her puritanical best to
prevent anyone from completing his next-to-last sketches for Act 3:
Friedrich Cerha had to carry out his faithful labours in conditions of
secrecy. Without that, Lulu would have remained an exciting torso, a very
black sex-comedy with a whiff of tragedy. The complete version is, as it
ought to be, an overwhelming experience.
In the Royal Festival Hall on Friday (and no doubt at Birmingham on Sunday
too), Lulu was sensational and overwhelming. Nobody who heard it will forget
it for a long time. With the BBC Symphony and a superbly chosen
international cast, Andrew Davis led a scarifying performance. Billed as a
'concert performance', it was much more than that.
Most of the singers were veterans of staged Lulus. Not only could they do
without scores, but they acted their roles to the hilt without props  -
well, just one pistol - in the long, narrow space in front of the orchestra,
something like an allotment planted with microphones at every turn. Somehow
Davis managed to keep them vividly audible, while taking full advantage of
his exposed band to render Berg's intricate score more transparent than is
ever possible from an orchestra-pit.
It sounded glorious: opulent, intensely expressive, horribly affecting. And
without stage paraphernalia, we even seemed to see the opera with new
clarity, unhampered by any producer's 'concept'; the gestures and physical
interplay were enough. At the centre of it all, of course, was Lulu herself,
miraculously incarnated by the American soprano Patricia Wise.
She had everything: liquid silver at the top of the voice (where Berg's
demands are almost unnatural), a gleefully indecent gown, the practised
manners of a sex-kitten and a subtle way with phrases - but also a mature,
comprehensive insight into the role. Though sex-kitten victims are common
enough, it is a rare Lulu who can pronounce herself to be nothing more than
what men see in her with such poignant, unwinking candour. The role is
cruelly taxing, and most Lulus try it on for only a few years; I pray that
the Royal Opera will revive its excellent production for Miss Wise with all
possible haste.
There were no weak links among the other principals, too numerous to praise
as deserved - Wolfgang Schone dignified and tortured as Lulu's 'protector'
(and monstrous as Jack the Ripper); Ryszard Karczykowski, Theo Adam and
Robin Leggate well-seasoned as luckless Alwa, creepy Schigolch and the
ruined Painter; a warm, sad lesbian Countess from Jane Henschel and an
ebullient Athlete by Lenus Carlson. The supertitles were patchy and erratic,
so it was doubly a pity that the Hall ran out of programmes before the start
 -Wedekind's plot is too complicated to guess at.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Arts: True grit under the flag - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK has a new institution created by one of its oldest. The Moving
Theatre Company has been founded by Vanessa and Corin Redgrave; their
co-directors are Lenka Udovicki of former Yugoslavia and Helena Kaut-Howson
of Theatr Clwyd. Its first production, The Flag, at the excellent Bridge
Lane Theatre, sets the tone for the company's work: gritty and trenchant.
This makes a fine debut. Brechtian drama follows in April.
The Flag, written by Alex Ferguson from the novel by Robert Shaw follows the
fortunes of a left-wing clergyman back from the horrors of trench warfare
and dizzy with hopes of the 1926 General Strike. Shaw's novel, the first of
an uncompleted trilogy, looks to George Orwell in content and George Ewart
Evans in country style, for it is set in a sleepy parish in Suffolk.
The central figure, John Calvin (excellently played by Corin Redgrave) is
not a character but a magnet for nonconformity: sexual, political and
religious. He is brought to Suffolk by a mischievous and libidinous dowager
who loves him and his politics: 'Wonderful news,' she reports, 'I've found a
socialist, a real socialist . . . in Manchester.' Calvin duly offers the
recalcitrant parishioners new forms of faith. The Red Flag hangs in the
church, a totem for the play's action.
Ferguson's adaptation makes sporadically powerful theatre. The original
novel's impact lay in its picture of the world rather than in the pattern of
exchanges between individuals on stage. The play has to give up social
description for dramatic action. Corin Redgrave's direction (with Gillian
Hambleton) moves deftly between times, and switches sharply among the large
cast of characters: Calvin's malcontent wife, his pubescent children, his
erstwhile comrades in arms and the bevy of bucolics.
What remains at the end is the sense that something telling has happened,
and regret that the play leaves so much unsaid. Beneath runs the fear of
capitalism and disappointment in the labour movement. Socialists in 1926
must have held their breath, face to face with something commensurate to
their capacity for action. But only the miners stayed out on strike.
Bridge Lane Theatre until April 2

FT  14 MAR 94 / Monday Interview: Survivor in a youth industry - Peter
Bonfield tells Lucy Kellaway why he is content to grow older with ICL
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Peter Bonfield, chairman of ICL, could be anyone in the world who would
he choose? The younger and richer Bill Gates? The head of Fujitsu, ICL's
parent company?
Far from it: Bonfield's hero is veteran guitarist Eric Clapton. He loves the
music, admires the man, and even copies his taste in footwear with a pair of
Timberland boots.
At Clapton's concert in the Albert Hall last month, the chairman of ICL was
to be seen clapping and stomping at the front while his guests watched at a
polite distance in the corporate box.
Both Clapton and Bonfield are Peter Pan figures in their professions. This
year the businessman celebrates his 50th birthday and his tenth anniversary
running ICL, making him - like the guitarist - a successful elderly survivor
in a youth industry.
What Bonfield admires most about Clapton is his ability to change. That,
too, is what he is most proud of in his decade at ICL. On Wednesday the
company will announce results that will show ICL is still outrunning most of
the European competition.
The day I met him in his unassuming Putney office he was not wearing his
Timberland boots, but was looking a dapper Jack the Lad in a pair of woven
black leather shoes and double breasted suit. Neither was he jumping up and
down, but sitting bolt upright on the edge of his sofa, answering questions
briefly, directly and openly.
In his lapel he was wearing a little enamel badge with a tick - a sign of
ICL's commitment to quality and part of the uniform of the ICL manager.
Bonfield is never without his badge - or almost never. When, at a recent
weekend ICL brainstorming conference, he turned up for breakfast without it,
he was challenged by his colleagues. 'I forgot to take it off my pyjamas,'
he said.
It was a joke, but only just. Bonfield takes this sort of thing very
seriously. Total Quality Management, benchmarking, empowerment, investing in
people . . .every good practice in the management book - you name it,
Bonfield embraces it.
He is a classic workaholic - working punishingly long days, weekends, and
almost never taking holidays. He says he feels no stress; he just loves the
job. When he is not working he is running or peddling furiously away on his
exercise bike. And when he is not doing that he is asleep. Is he, I wonder,
like Margaret Thatcher, the kind of person who thrives on just five hours
sleep a night? 'Oh no. I'm not like Margaret Thatcher at all,' he says, his
face deadpan but eyes shining to suggest he has made a joke. 'I'm a quite
different person.'
His wife, also a fitness freak, sees him seldom, although last year they did
go whitewater rafting together. It was his first holiday in a decade, and
was such a success that Bonfield may even take a few days off this year to
take her for a climb up Ben Nevis.
A man who sets such high standards for himself might be expected to be a
nightmare to work for. Especially one who unfailingly takes the tough
decision - most famously he closed down the factory in which his own father
worked. Yet even those who by rights should dislike him speak as if Bonfield
is their best friend. 'Peter is a visionary,' says Professor Garry Hunt, an
ex-director of ICL who lost his job in a reshuffle. 'He's got respect in the
industry.'
Even trade unionists who have quarrelled with ICL over its attempts to push
them out of the picture feel admiration for the company's chief. 'He
understands the importance of high technology and the need to promote it to
a wider audience,' says Larry Brooke of the MSF manufacturing union.
Bonfield makes it his business to be involved in industry matters beyond the
corporate confines of ICL. He is on the board of the British Quality
Foundation, is a member of an EU technology task force, and (unusually for a
British businessman) sits on the board of various US and European companies.
He says - half seriously - that when he became managing director of ICL at
39 he was already 'getting on a bit', and ten years later he refers to
himself as an 'old grey beard'. The key to survival in the business is to be
'very fast-moving, very international and very flexible. If you've got those
it doesn't matter how old you are'.
Bonfield appears to have all three traits. This south Londoner with his flat
vowels is one of Britain's most international businessmen. After university
he spent ten years working for Texas Instruments in the US, which he says
shifted his focus forever. 'The thing that really changed me was that six
months out of university I was running a team in Dallas. My mates were still
in digs in Leicester.' At ICL he has been immersed in the European computer
market, and since 1990 he has been running a company 80 per cent-owned by
the Japanese.
Even though he can't speak Japanese, (he admits to being barely able to
speak French) he goes down well in Japan. Contrary to the popular fear that
Fujitsu would swamp ICL, Bonfield has continued to run the company
autonomously. 'A lot of people wouldn't believe that Fujitsu has dumped
Dollars 1.3bn into this company and left me to run it,' he says. Part of the
reason is that ICL has performed, making profits when almost every other
European computer company was making losses. But it is also due to a
personal affinity between Bonfield and his Japanese bosses. He says his
approach to business is similar to theirs. Both, he says, are 'open,
transparent, trusting, and think in a long-term strategic way'.
The flip side of his success is the danger that he has made himself too
important to the company and its relationship with its parent. Hunt argues
that his one serious mistake is not to have paid enough attention to
grooming successors.
The problem is made worse by the fact that Bonfield combines the roles of
chairman and chief executive, thus committing a serious sin of the modern
boardroom. He excuses himself by arguing that with two major shareholders
breathing down his neck there is no shortage of checks and balances.
That would change if the company fulfils its ambition and floats on the
stockmarket, in which case the roles would be split. Bonfield has hinted in
the past that he might go when the company floats, but that possibility is
receding. 'I'd never float the company and run off,' he says.

FT  14 MAR 94 / People: Calvin Klein takes strides to Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Calvin Klein, the American designer so beloved by the well heeled, has just
woken up to the fact that Europe is big and rich and he can't think why he
neglected it for so long.
'I just had no idea my ranges would be so successful,' he says. 'I've lived
most of my life in New York and I design for the women I know. I thought
this sort of modern, working, liberated woman was mainly found on my side of
the Atlantic. What I have discovered to my great surprise is that women all
over the world now want to dress that way.'
Calvin Klein's life has clearly been full of lovely surprises. Underwear was
another. He had no idea it would be so big. In the first year (November
1983-1984) that his underwear designs hit the stores, women bought some
Dollars 70m worth of fly-front boxer shorts, briefs with white elastic
bands, and assorted T-shirts. Nobody, not even Calvin predicted that. 'I
just tried to take it beyond the classic and the predictable, to give it
more meaning. So now people lounge in it, swim in it, go out in it.' And, he
might have added, leave the tops of their jeans undone so that their
excellent taste in underwear can be more widely noted. The other day he sold
the underwear company to Warnaco for nearly Dollars 70m.
Fragrance was another of his happy surprises. His fragrance business, owned
by Unilever, does 'half a billion dollars a year in the US &amp; Europe.' That
is nothing like as large as the fragrance businesses of cosmetic houses such
as Estee Lauder or Revlon but it is big business for a single American
designer.
A less happy surprise was the financial difficulty in which he found himself
in 1993 when David Geffen, the Hollywood producer and a long-time fan,
rescued him by buying up some long-term debt 'because Calvin was having
trouble with repayment of the principal.'
The sticky moment seems past. Expansion is on Klein's mind. He plans to open
his Calvin Klein shops in almost all major cities (St. Moritz, Barcelona and
Zurich have got them - Geneva, Hong Kong, Singapore are on the
drawing-board, London, Paris and Milan are being considered). In addition he
wants to manufacture in Europe, which could bring his prices down by some 25
per cent. Given that a suit from his top range, The Collection, costs about
Pounds 1,200, and a sweater some Pounds 350, this would seem a good move. As
he puts it, 'if they are selling now at those prices, imagine the business
we could do if we can get them down.'
The financial dimensions of Klein's business are hard to establish. The
holding company is privately owned; figures are a matter of guesswork.
Calvin Klein himself professes not to keep track of these details. Fortune
magazine estimated in 1981 that his personal annual income before tax was
some Dollars 8.5m. The Calvin Klein organisation says its worldwide sales at
wholesale prices are more than Dollars 1bn a year, including licensed
products.
Klein is 51-years-old, tall and thin with the air of a slightly rumpled,
world-weary Yves Montand. Then he starts to talk and he couldn't be anything
but a New Yorker. He has considerable charm and knows it.
Born in the Bronx he was fascinated by clothes from an early age and started
to sketch them at five. In 1969 he produced a small collection of six coats
and three dresses which by accident were seen by a Bonwit Teller buyer. From
that moment his career took off. Like all the most commercially successful
designers he has a business partner, Barry Schwartz, a childhood friend who
gave him the Pounds 2,000 he needed to launch himself and who is credited
with much of the business acumen.
Klein has a clear idea of his ultimate customer. 'I don't design for trophy
wives or the woman who likes to decorate herself for her man. I dress the
woman who is very busy. She has a job and children and boardroom meetings
and lunches. She goes out to the theatre or to see friends. For this she
needs clothes but clothes that are soft, easy, comfortable.'
In common with Armani, with whom his clothes are often compared, he carries
the cult of simplicity to almost oppressive lengths. The girls in their
entourages are almost interchangeable - open-faced, bare of make-up, simply
cut shining hair, no nail-polish and sober colours (navy-blue, charcoal
grey, black) comprise the prevailing aesthetic.
His work exemplifies certain truths about fashion. While fashion may be
about change, truly beautiful clothes need no adornment. Where there is fine
cut no tricks are needed.
To the charge that he is not a genuinely creative designer Calvin Klein
suggests that what he offers may be subtle but is not without innovation.
'I give women a reason to buy something new by using a new fabric, a new
shape, a new combination, new colours - but the philosophy behind the
clothing never changes.' All through the eighties when many were producing
what he called 'frankly trashy clothes' he went on doing his own thing. 'I
don't know how to do anything else,' he says. When it comes to menswear he
designs the sort of clothes he likes to wear himself. 'They should, above
all, be comfortable.'
In the week after the fashion industry has been short of inspiration, beauty
and glamour, it might give the international catwalk kings and queens, cause
to reflect that while their models are strutting about in furry G-strings
and lycra-stretch mini-skirts, Calvin Klein is doing great business by
offering cool, sober, classic clothes that speak of class and that fit
effortlessly into the lives of women the world over.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Management: Tuning the channel - After Digital's big job
cuts in Europe, Alan Cane explains the company's plans to revamp its
distribution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The problems faced by Digital Equipment, once second only to International
Business Machines as a computer manufacturer, are brutally clear. It is
losing money, its sales are declining, and it is supporting a cost structure
several percentage points higher than the market can afford.
Across the world, Digital is seeking its salvation through cost cutting,
successful sales of its 'Alpha' chip, the world's fastest microprocessor,
and market acceptance of the company's approach to 'client-server' systems,
which customers are beginning to favour over older, centralised approaches
to data processing.
But in Europe the company's hopes are pinned on a specific plan which
involves a fundamental shift in its approach to distributors, software
houses and systems integrators, the 'business partners' who sell Digital
computers directly to customers, adding value in the form of special
software and services.
Digital's problems are particularly acute in Europe which now provides about
50 per cent of its global revenues. In a frank report in the company's
European newsletter last month Ed Lucente, corporate vice president for
sales and marketing, warned top managers that Digital faced its toughest
third and fourth quarters: this after two years with only one quarter in
profit. He said: 'We are being outgunned in the marketplace.'
The plan to put this right has been put in place by Vincenzo Damiani, a
53-year-old former IBM senior executive who became the company's president
at the beginning of the year.
It will involve substantial restructuring. Some 6,000 of the European
organisation's 29,000 employees will be made redundant this year. Analyses
carried out by special project teams have suggested that Digital's
productivity is half the industry average.
Digital has made many mistakes over the past decade. It was slow to
understand that personal computers would become the dominant force in the
industry. It was slow to realise that high-powered workstations would form
the basis of client-server computing. Worst of all it failed to manage its
distribution channels in a consistent fashion.
The trouble is that the business model for success in the computer industry
has changed irrevocably. In the heyday of the mainframe, a small number of
major manufacturers sold computers commanding high gross profit margins to
their customers through big, expensive direct sales forces. Customers wrote
their own software or hired software companies to do it for them.
Today, the profit margin on hardware is too slim to support such an
expensive structure and the relative importance of business partners - the
'channel' - has grown enormously. Channel partners not only distribute
hardware but sell packaged software, help customers develop their own
programs and work with them on installing complex networks.
What is necessary for successful channel management? First, a sensible
discount structure so the channel can make reasonable profits. IBM, which
has had to learn about channel management just as painfully as Digital, was
criticised by distributors until recently for pricing policies which made it
difficult for them to make money.
Second, a guarantee that the manufacturer will not compete with the
distributor or systems house either by selling directly or by developing
customer software. The spectacular growth of Compaq, the world's leading
high-performance personal computer manufacturer, was helped by a policy of
selling only through distributors.
Third, manufacturer and channel must work together to their mutual benefit,
agreeing, for example, joint investment in product promotions.
It is no exaggeration to say that a computer company's success today is
likely to be directly proportional to its ability to manage its channel
relationships. This is particularly true of smaller customers (expensive to
reach through a direct salesforce), who will look to distributors and
resellers for systems and service. Europe's 2m to 3m smaller customers are
nevertheless the best hope for growth, so it is worrying for Digital that
its products are represented in only about 20,000 to 30,000 of them.
Enrico Pesatori, general manager of Digital's personal computer business
unit, admits that the company has 'never had a rational or coherent approach
to our channel partners'. Damiani says: 'The nub is how well we do in future
with our partners. You have to complement rather than antagonise'.
He refers continually to working with partners rather than through them, and
insists this is more than mere semantics: 'To work through partners gives a
very clear idea that the two parties are not working at the same level,' he
chides. 'We must select partners with care. We should not have hundreds, but
only the ones we need.'
The plan, which Damiani dubs his 'Go to Market' strategy, has three
elements. First, Digital's 500 or so key European accounts will be managed
directly by account executives. They will represent Digital to their
customers and have the responsibility for making the customer's voice heard
within the organisation. The success of these account executives will be
measured on the percentage that Digital takes of the customer's total data
processing budget, no matter what channel is used.
Second, the small to medium company market will be served by a combination
of the direct sales force and channel partners. The principal aim here will
be to persuade customers to move to systems based on Digital's Alpha chip.
Attracting new customers will depend on strong relationships with software
houses and value-added resellers.
Third, the large piece of the market represented by very small enterprises
and individuals will be directly managed by distributors and the larger
value-added resellers.
Damiani's plan for Digital's European business partners is a model of the
way the company must transform itself globally if it is to survive as a
force in data processing. Pesatori is in no doubt the partners must believe
Digital has changed: 'This time,' he says, 'we have to persuade them we are
for real.'

FT  14 MAR 94 / Management: New route to the top position - A report that
predicts personnel directors' increasing clout in the boardroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Personnel as a corporate function has changed radically in the past 10 to 15
years from a comparatively low-grade advisory position to one that fills a
strategic role in business management.
Who says so? Personnel experts do, perhaps not surprisingly, in an attitude
survey* carried out by Spencer Stuart, the headhunting company.
The survey, which quotes anonymously from some of the leading experts in the
field, suggests that the role has evolved markedly in recent years to the
point where it is now being treated as vital in many boardrooms.
In line with its greater importance, however, there has been a streamlining
of personnel management and more frequent farming out to contractors
of several personnel responsibilities.
'Narrow personnel specialists in areas such as training, remuneration,
pensions and selection will increasingly be outside the company,' it says,
leaving those personnel directors who survive at the core of the
organisation to assume more general responsibilities in the future.
The report says that while it has been exceptional for personnel directors
to become chairman in the past, it will become more common as they gain the
breadth of experience that will make them candidates for the job.
Is this wishful thinking? Certainly, there is a consistency in the comments
collected in the interviews. One executive said: 'Personnel people are now
much more part of running the business. They are getting credit for
understanding the business and some will eventually end up running it.'
Another argument was that the best personnel official was in a position to
see the totality of the organisation. 'Personnel has the unique opportunity
to see across all business lines, in a way that even finance cannot,'
observed one respondent.
The comments appear to reflect a recognition that people are now considered
to be the most valuable assets of many businesses. Perhaps this has long
been the case but it is only comparatively recently that senior executives
have been saying so and addressing what this means in terms of corporate
strategy and organisation.
Among the findings in the report was a deep resistance to the term 'human
resource manager'. Many saw it as meaningless American jargon, reflecting a
ruthless manipulative approach towards people. Others saw it as
distinguishing the new-style strategist from the old-style professional
involved in caring and looking after people. Some pointed out that personnel
had a very limited meaning in the US.
Whatever the nomenclature, the general feeling was that if personnel
responsibilities were only administrative there was no justification for a
personnel manager taking a seat on the board. A boardroom personnel role
involved defining,
inspiring and guiding organisational change, said the
respondents.
Nigel Dyckhoff, the Spencer Stuart partner who compiled the report, says:
'The main conclusion is that whereas 10 or 15 years ago we were
talking about personnel as
an advisory function, in 10
years' time it will probably be the best way to the top. It is moving from a
caring job to a strategic job.'

FT  14 MAR 94 / Management: Good omens for MCA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 'minimal' increase in the combined fee income of members of the Management
Consultancies Association in 1993 masked an encouraging final quarter for
the industry.
According to Brian O'Rorke, executive director of the MCA, the return to
what he called 'pre-recession' income levels in the last three months was 'a
good omen for the coming year'. Total fee income in 1993 for the MCA's 34
members, which account for more than half the fee-earning management
consultancy in the UK, amounted to Pounds 868m.
Information technology work was again by far the biggest income contributor,
with financial and administrative systems and production and services
management in second and third places. Overseas earnings, largely thanks to
work elsewhere in the European Union, rose by 6 per cent.
While last week's figures give cause for optimism, MCA president Keith
Burgess, who is managing partner of Andersen Consulting UK, also highlighted
a few concerns.
Referring to complaints by companies that consultants are too expensive, he
urged members 'to ensure that all our deliverables are measurable and that
improvements to our clients' operations are real and tangible . . . We
should learn to quantify results, so notions of imprecise benefits resulting
from consultants' work become a thing of the past'.
Burgess also made a pointed reference to sole practitioners, whose numbers
have swelled in recent years and who by many accounts are providing
significant competition at the margin for bigger firms. 'Unlike sole
practitioners we (MCA members) are able to provide the knowledge capital of
our organisations, the development and education of our people and financial
back-up to the work we undertake. The contribution of a consulting firm is
more than the sum of the individuals who work in it.'

FT  14 MAR 94 / Business Travel: Autobahn etiquette - Judy Dempsey takes to
the road in eastern Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Planning to do business in eastern Germany that requires a lot of time on
the road? Then get up early and hit the autobahn at 5am. If you don't, you
will end up sitting in traffic jams.
Just like the capital Berlin, the roads in eastern Germany are virtual
building sites. Teams of diggers, bulldozers and cranes stretch along the
motorways to Leipzig, Dresden, Rostock and Erfurt. More than DM80bn (Pounds
31bn) is being spent on upgrading the region's infrastructure. By 1996, it
should be bliss to drive in eastern Germany - but that is of little comfort
to those using the roads today.
There are three golden rules for road users to remember, and some local
habits to bear in mind.
First, listen to the radio. The local radio stations for Berlin, Brandenburg
and all the other eastern states provide the best travel information. Their
traffic service people often fly over the motorways in helicopters, relaying
news of the latest accident or roadworks. Take them seriously: they will
tell you which side roads to take.
The side roads run through small, cobble-stoned villages and towns. The only
problem is that, without warning, you are likely to come across a small
yellow sign with black lettering saying Umleitung, or diversion.
These diversions are a bit like a long German sentence. You have to drive
miles for the verb.
If you have time, you can get an extraordinary glimpse of rural eastern
Germany: the slow pace of life has no comparison in the west. You will also
see a great deal of construction taking place, with former owners, ossies
(east Germans) and wessies (western Germans), renovating the houses.
The second rule is adhere to the speed limits. West Germans, brought up with
no limits and fast cars, must be heavily subsidising the eastern
road-building programme from the fines meted out to them.
There are few cameras monitoring speed - except for a few miles outside
Berlin and particularly on the two-lane motorway from Berlin via Magdeburg
to Wolfburg, the headquarters of Volkswagen. But don't be deceived. The
police are uberall. Unless you have a hired car, sooner or later a summons
will land on your desk.
And the penalties are stiff. You are fined DM1 for every kilometre over the
speed limit, and DM1 for every kilometre of the speed limit. If you exceed
the maximum 130km per hour, your licence could be confiscated.
The third rule is to leave enough time. Do not believe your colleagues when
they say it will take only two hours to reach Rostock, or less than three
hours to reach Dresden from Berlin. Stretches of motorway are often reduced
to single-lane or narrow double-lane traffic, and even these roads are
bumpy. The speed limit is often 60km an hour, sometimes even 40km, and lasts
for about 25km. Even if you have a trouble-free drive, it can take an hour
to get from the motorway to the centre of some main cities.
A case in point is Leipzig, Saxony, which is set to become one of the most
prosperous cities in eastern Germany. As you turn off the E51, or number 9
motorway, towards the centre, you will see that hardly a patch of grass has
been left unturned. Investors, with their armies of construction workers,
are building shopping centres, garages and factories. This has attracted an
unprecedented amount of traffic - and Umleitungen.
Unless you really know the small side roads and streets into the centre,
follow the signs. Whether you should also follow the local driving
traditions is another matter. West German drivers are not known for their
patience or courtesy. They rarely give way. They have little time for the
ossies driving their two-stroke engine Trabants. If you take pity on a
Trabby driver, who has been waiting an era to pull out of a side street, the
chances are the BMW driver behind you will hoot loudly, flash the lights,
and speed past you at the first opportunity with a snarl.
One of the few former East German laws that have been incorporated into new
regulations is that you do not have to stop at traffic lights leading right
on to a main road, if there is a little green arrow beside the lights. The
trouble is that west Germans still wait at the lights, while the ossies
behind quietly fume. Perhaps a hoot is in order?
Despite all these drawbacks, there are many positive aspects to driving in
eastern Germany. Apart from the scenery - particularly through the lush
plains of the northern state of Mecklenburg-western Pomerania - you actually
see the progress being made. For example, the roadworks at Zehlendorf, the
former border crossing from west Berlin into eastern Germany, have finished.
And the stretch of motorway along the E13 just before Dresden is complete.
Above all, once you reach your destination, you'll no longer have to face
the drab, communist-style hotels, where receptionists said they were full
when they were empty, and waitresses said the restaurants were packed as the
loud band played to a few weary travellers. You'll no longer have to wonder
about the availability of phones and faxes. In fact, it will almost have
been worth setting out at 5am.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Business Travel: Sizing up Sydney - Kate Bevan explains how
to get around the city
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATE BEVAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like Captain Cook and the convicts who followed him, the modern traveller's
point of entry to Sydney is Botany Bay. The runway of Kingsford Smith
airport, 8km south of the city's business and tourism centre, juts into the
bay.
Although the journey to Australia is much faster than in Cook's day, getting
out of the airport can be slow. The international terminal is overstretched,
and luggage may take some time to reach the reclaim hall.
Expect customs officials to ask suspicious questions about everything of an
organic or edible nature that might be in your luggage, particularly if
you've arrived from Asia - although travellers are no longer greeted with
flight attendants spraying their aircraft with insecticide.
Many travellers smuggle pots of Marmite through customs for pining British
expats, but if these are found they will be confiscated and you will be
heavily fined.
Luggage trolleys can only be freed from their ranks with ADollars 2 coins -
so break into a note on the aircraft.
The business and tourist areas are concentrated in the oldest part of the
city, much of which has views of the harbour bridge and the opera house,
although the suburbs sprawl in all directions around the harbour. Most
business travellers will stay and work in that central downtown area.
The efficient transit system boasts two bus services from the airport,
running from the international terminal via the two domestic terminals into
the city. Information leaflets at the airport will help you decide which
route to take.
The first service, Route 300, goes to the Central railway station through
the business district and then on to Circular Quay, the central ferry wharf
for harbourside suburbs. Route 350 runs via Central station through Kings
Cross, east of the business district. Look after your belongings in Kings
Cross at night. The trip on either bus costs ADollars 5 (Pounds 2.40), or
ADollars 8 for a return ticket, and should take about 30 minutes.
There are also a couple of privately operated bus services which run to
city-centre hotels and those in the new tourist complex at Darling Harbour,
which is not on the airport bus routes.
However, if your destination is outside the central business district, you
will find yourself dragging luggage on to connecting services. Sydney's
CityRail connections cover most of the city south of the harbour and a line
runs to North Sydney, a growing business district north of the harbour
bridge. The best place to make your connection is Central station, where
both airport bus services call, or Wynyard station, also the main
interchange for commuter buses.
Otherwise, it is worth using the cheap ferries to get to harbour-side
suburbs. They all start from Circular Quay, which is simple to use and has
clear signposting.
Bus services to and around the north shore from Wynyard station are
frequent, but travellers with heavy luggage might consider getting the
airport bus to Circular Quay - the nearest point to the water - and then
getting a taxi across the bridge or through the harbour tunnel.
Taxis are plentiful into the city and will set you back about ADollars 20
from the airport for a trip south of the harbour bridge or tunnel. Taxi
drivers expect single passengers to sit in the front with them and, although
tipping is not the custom in Australia, they won't be averse to accepting
one.
For getting around the city, several travel passes are available based on
the rather confusing zone system, as well as the Sydney Pass, which is valid
for three, five or seven days and costs from ADollars 50. That covers all
the city buses and ferries - but not the trains - as well as some tourist
buses, plus your return fare on the airport bus. You can buy a pass when you
arrive at the airport, on the airport bus, or at various locations around
the city.
Transport around the city is tightly regulated and efficient. But you are on
your own if you hit the tourist trail - dozens of unregulated operators are
willing to relieve you of your dollars for a spin around the harbour or a
cuddle with a koala.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Business Travel (Update): Polish flights
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Polish airline LOT's first passenger flight to London for four months
left Warsaw yesterday following the resolution of a flight-allocation feud
with British Airways.
Under an agreement announced earlier this month, each airline has been
allotted nine flights a week during the winter season ending March 26 and up
to 15 flights a week during the summer season.
The two carriers will each have 12 flights a week between the end of March
and the peak summer season (June to August) when three additional flights
will be added.
The Anglo-Polish dispute erupted last October when Warsaw refused British
Airways permission to double its number of flights between the two
countries. London retaliated by banning LOT flights to Britain, and Poland
replied in kind.
LOT business manager Jan Mich said the airline had lost about Dollars 1
million in ticket revenues during the dispute.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Business Travel (Update): Tourists attacked in Egypt

<TEXT>
Suspected Moslem militants fired at a tourist boat on the river Nile
yesterday, as security forces took a tight grip on the rest of Egypt as
Moslems celebrated the end of the holy month of Ramadan, Reuter reports from
Cairo.
No one was injured in the attack on the cruiser, which took place near the
Moslem fundamentalist stronghold of Assiut, 320 km south of Cairo. The
militant Gama'a al-Islamiya group has claimed responsibility for eight
previous attacks on Nile cruisers.
In Assiut itself, a stronghold of the Gama'a, security forces prevented the
group from holding a mass gathering at the dawn prayers marking the end of
the month-long fast of Ramadan.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Labour urged to shift on pensions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour's commitment to increase the basic pension for everybody should be
replaced by greater targeting of the state pension scheme, says the
Commission on Social Justice.
In a paper published today, the commission, which the party set up to advise
on policies for the welfare state, recommends options to focus pensions and
benefits on those with little or no income from occupational pensions.
The options include integrating benefits with the income tax system for
pensioners.

<TEXT>
A detainee at the Home Office centre at which almost all 200 inmates are on
hunger strike collapsed yesterday, the Home Office said last night, Edward
Mortimer writes.
It said that seven had been separated from the other detainees at the
Campsfield centre for asylum seekers, near Oxford. 'They are supervised by a
nurse and checked every half hour,' the Home Office said.
It denied allegations from other detainees that some had been force-fed by
Home Office officials and staff of Group 4 security company, which runs the
centre.
The Home Office added that the detainee who had collapsed had been seen by a
doctor who was 'not concerned about his medical condition'.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Labour urged to shift on pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour's commitment to increase the basic pension for everybody should be
replaced by greater targeting of the state pension scheme, says the
Commission on Social Justice.
In a paper published today, the commission, which the party set up to advise
on policies for the welfare state, recommends options to focus pensions and
benefits on those with little or no income from occupational pensions.
The options include integrating benefits with the income tax system for
pensioners, a guaranteed minimum pension and higher benefits for older
pensioners who are less likely to have occupational pensions.
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, indicated at a recent
seminar on pensions organised by the Fabian Society that he was thinking
along similar lines.
The paper, by Mr Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says that
the basic pension is falling as a percentage of average earnings. It has
fallen to 15 per cent of male average earnings from 20 per cent in 1978. By
2040 it will amount to just 6 per cent if it continues to be increased in
line with prices rather than earnings.
Yet raising the basic state pension enough to lift all pensioners out of
poverty would be expensive - increasing it to the level of income support
would cost Pounds 4.5bn a year. This increase would fail to help the poorest
pensioners, with the benefit going only to those above the poverty line.
However, it rejects a simple switch from the basic pension to means-tested
income support. This would create disincentives to save, the paper says.
There are also problems of take-up with means-tested benefits, which many
pensioners see as stigmatising them.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Major's public-service brainchild fails test: A white paper
on the progress of the Citizen's Charter is published this week. There may
be little to report . . .
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BY MOTOKO RICH AND JOHN WILLMAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The prime minister's Citizen's Charter, three years old next week, has
failed to achieve central objectives in many of the public services it is
intended to improve, scrutiny of the various charters show.
On Wednesday the Cabinet Office will publish a white paper setting out the
progress made in meeting the goals of the charter.
When Mr John Major launched the charter he promised it would force public
services to tell customers 'where they stand and what service they have the
right to expect'. There would be 'financial sanctions' if the services
failed to come up with the goods.
But an audit by the FT of the 15 charters for public services in England
shows that many specify no standards at all, or standards that are so vague
they leave the customers in the dark.
With most services there is no financial compensation when things go wrong.
And few charters are independently audited, or overseen by an independent
adjudicator who can deal with complaints.
In addition to the 15 charters for England, government bodies such as
British Rail, the Social Security Benefits Agency and the Inland Revenue
have produced another 21 for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. There are
also special charters for businesses, such as the Customs &amp; Excise Freight
Charter for exporters in the road haulage industry.
Mr William Waldegrave, minister in charge of the Citizen's Charter, said:
'Changes are happening where they matter most in services people use and
rely on every day of their lives.'
But five charters looked at by the FT promise better service without
specific standards of performance. The Tenant's Charter says good councils
will 'have answering machines to take messages when there is nobody in the
office'. The Higher Education Charter promises that applications for student
places will be 'handled efficiently and fairly'.
Others limit themselves to promises about trying to see customers within a
specified time of entering an office, replying to letters in 28 days and
answering the telephone in less than 20 seconds.
In some cases, the promise is in the form that 80 per cent of telephone
calls will be answered within 20 seconds (Child Support Agency). Callers who
take longer than this to get through can only assume that they are in the
unlucky 20 per cent.
Just six of the charters in the audit offer the financial compensation
promised by Mr Major. In practice, the charter has reduced payments to
customers from British Rail.
Only four of the 15 charters have independent checks on whether they are
meeting performance targets. For example, a National Consumer Council survey
of 35 county courts in England and Wales found that in some cases almost 90
per cent of the courts were failing to reach even the simplest requirements
of the courts charter.
Only three of the organisations have independent bodies that will take up
users' complaints.
In most cases there are rights to appeal to the ombudsmen for central
government, local authorities and the health service. But these have been in
operation since long before the Citizen's Charter was launched and are not
geared up to deal with large numbers of minor charter complaints.
The original Citizen's Charter white paper published in 1991 said 'there
should be a clear presumption that standards will be progressively improved
as services become more efficient'.
Fewer than half of the charters we looked at have been toughened up. Some
have been revised more in style than in content. According to the NCC:
'Revision of the Patient's Charter gave no new rights to consumers.'
The charter's promise to reduce maximum waiting times for certain operations
from two years to 18 months has in some cases meant loner waiting times for
other operations that used to have short waits. The NCC said: 'Now everybody
seems to have a consistently longish wait.'
When Mr Major launched the Citizen's Charter he said it was 'a testament to
our belief in people's right to be informed'. The Department for Education
plans to spend more than Pounds 2m on sending 20m copies of the Parent's
Charter to every home. A summary of the Patient's Charter has also been
delivered to all households in England. More than Pounds 14m has been spent
on the publication and distribution of charters, according to the Office of
Public Service and Science.
In spite of this, many charters aren't getting the message across, according
to a National Consumer Council survey. The council found that 35 per cent of
those questioned did not remember hearing about the Patient's Charter. Only
24 per cent remembered ever having seen a copy.
More than 90 per cent of respondents to a survey on the Courts Charter had
not been given information about court facilities and 88 per cent had not
been sent details of how to get to the court and 77 per cent had not been
informed of a complaints procedure.
Most charter agencies now have helplines. Some are genuinely helpful - the
Patient's Charter has a comprehensive remit for answering questions.
But even with helplines, there appears to be trouble getting the message
across. When we telephoned the Customs &amp; Excise helpline for the Traveller's
Charter, the staff said 'Quite honestly, you are one of the first people to
call.'

FT  14 MAR 94 / Opinion divided on Tube Charter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ms Jane Eyes, a senior account executive at PR firm Burson-Marsteller, is
occasionally delayed on her journey to work on the London Underground,
Motoko Rich writes.
But she has never applied for the refund on the ticket price to which she is
entitled under the London Underground Customer Charter. 'I was not aware I
could,' she said.
Mr Martin Bradshaw, a freelance journalist who uses the Circle or Central
Line every day, applied for a refund in February and has still not received
a voucher. 'As with a lot of things, it's all upfront PR with very little
behind it,' he said.
Yet the Underground is regarded by the Cabinet Office Citizen's Charter Unit
as having one of the best charters - one that fulfils a large proportion of
the original promises.
It is one of the few agencies that provides a clear compensation policy, and
growing numbers of consumers are taking advantage of it. Travellers delayed
by more than 15 minutes can claim a refund. Managers' pay is linked to area
performance targets.
In the first five months of the charter, 12,500 claimed refunds. In 1993,
60,000 claimed and in the first two months of 1994, 19,000 applied.
The 15-minute rule also represents the toughening of standards that Mr Major
promised. The service's first charter limited compensation to 20-minute
delays. And there is an independent auditor and adjudicator for the service
 -the London Regional Passengers Committee.
LU said it had exceeded its 1992-93 targets on almost all standards.
Now that she has heard about the LU charter, Ms Eyes believes it could be a
good idea. 'But at the end of the day what you want is to be able to get
from A to B and not be stuck with signal failures or smoke in the tunnel.'

FT  14 MAR 94 / Crime wave costs retailers Pounds 2.3bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Crime cost retailers Pounds 2.3bn in the year 1992-93, with about 30 per
cent perpetrated by shop staff, a report published today by Nene College
School of Business shows.
The report, sponsored by Boots, Dixons, Tesco, Entertainment UK, Barclaycard
and US security systems manufacturer Sensormatic, is based on reports
provided by retailers responsible for almost a quarter of UK retail sales.
It provides further evidence of the extent of retail crime, after a British
Retail Consortium survey published in January estimated that it cost
retailers Pounds 2bn in 1993.
The report found that 'ordinary theft' by customers, staff and suppliers
totalled Pounds 1,916m - more than the BRC's figure of about Pounds 1,400m -
with other forms of robbery and crime accounting for Pounds 377m.
Employee theft accounted for about Pounds 690m, or just over 30 per cent of
losses, while customer theft totalled Pounds 1bn, or 43 per cent.
Theft by suppliers accounted for just under 10 per cent, or Pounds 225m, and
burglary for 7.7 per cent, or Pounds 177m. Credit and payment card fraud,
ram raids, smash and grab raids, cash snatches, other forms of robbery, and
criminal damage each accounted for less than 2 per cent of losses through
crime.
The report found the average level of theft was about 1.35 per cent of
retail sales, with the highest rates found in pharmacies and toys, video and
music stores, and the lowest in sports and footwear shops, and furniture and
textiles stores. Grocery stores were responsible for nearly a quarter of all
losses through theft, however, and department stores accounted for 19 per
cent.
Shrinkage, which includes theft and administrative error and wastage,
equalled about 24 per cent of all retail profits.
The report found that more than 80 per cent of UK retailers favoured civil
recovery programmes, similar to those operating in the US, where recovery
agencies are empowered to make shoplifters pay for thefts and levy exemplary
fines, without recourse to legal authorities.

Higher-priced hotels in London, charging Pounds 56 to Pounds 85.50 a room,
were busier last year than in 1992, with occupancy rising from 53 per cent

Computer memory chips worth Pounds 2.3m were stolen at the weekend from
Haven Products in Greenock, Renfrewshire.
The raid is believed to be the largest in a series of chip thefts in Europe
in recent months.
Strathclyde police said at least three raiders brandishing metal bars held a
security guard hostage and loaded boxes of memory chips from a store into a
lorry stolen from another site.
Haven Products, founded in 1946 to employ people wounded in the second world
war, was taken over by the British Red Cross in the early 1960s. It employs
150 people, of whom 90 are disabled.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Sainsbury downgrades managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The supermarket group J. Sainsbury, which said on Friday it was cutting 650
jobs in its head and area offices, is stripping out layers of store
management in a pilot programme which staff fear could lead to further job
losses.
The company is phasing out section managers, who have responsibility for
particular areas of stores, in 25 outlets of various sizes around the
country. They will be replaced by new posts of assistant manager and team
leader.
The 350 section managers in the stores have been told to reapply for one of
the new posts by May 9 or take redundancy. Those not appointed to one of the
new posts will be offered alternative shop-floor employment, but their wages
will be guaranteed for only two years.
A section manager said: 'They are trying to get people to go. Two people's
jobs will be done by one person.'
Sainsbury insists that the move was 'not initiated as a cost-cutting
programme' but was aimed at improving efficiency and customer service. It
said the section manager's role had become 'often a very physical job and
not enough of a management role.'
The company will evaluate the programme in the autumn. If it is successful
it is likely to be extended across Sainsbury's 350 superstores, affecting
several thousand section and department managers.
The changes are not connected with the restructuring being carried out in
Sainsbury's head and area offices, which the group said on Friday would lead
to the loss of 650 jobs in the next six to eight months.
Annual savings from the redundancies and other initiatives are estimated at
Pounds 50m.
Sainsbury is likely to announce a provision of between Pounds 10m and Pounds
20m to cover restructuring costs when it announces current-year results in
May.

FT  14 MAR 94 / The joke's over, says Hartlepool
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Today on radio, television and poster sites Hartlepool starts a fightback
against decades of jokes.
Since the townspeople allegedly hanged a monkey - mistaken for a Frenchman -
in the Napoleonic Wars this north-east community has suffered a poor
reputation.
When work was plentiful in its steelworks, shipyards and docks Hartlepool
could be indifferent to this image. But from 1963, when it lost its last
shipyard, dramatic decline started in its heavy industrial backbone and
unemployment rose. Hartlepool, said Mr Ron Norman, chairman of the Teesside
Development Corporation, was 'the first town to go over the edge'.
Now its promotional bodies see tourists and inward investors in light
industry as crucial to economic well-being. To attract them, the borough
council today mounts a four-year, Pounds 600,000 campaign funded mainly by
the government-backed City Challenge urban regeneration scheme.
The campaign slogan, Hartlepool - The Future is Here, will be promoted
nationally on Classic FM and in regional media.
Between 1970 and 1992 the town, with a working-age population of less than
40,000, lost nearly 12,000 industrial jobs. Cream gateau manufacturing
employs more people than British Steel. One man in four is jobless.
Yet research identified the town's image problem as a continuing association
with dirty heavy industry. Mr Barry Keel, borough economic development
director, said inward investors selected sites by deleting the least
favoured from their list. 'That's why a negative image is very important,'
he said.
It matters for Hartlepool's tourist drive too. The government-funded
Teesside Development Corporation forecasts more than 1m visitors a year for
the town's marina, built from derelict dockland.
The marina includes housing, shopping and a pseudo-18th century fishing
village built around the dry dock of the defunct Gray's shipyard.
The Napoleonic frigate HMS Trincomalee, the second-oldest floating warship,
will move to the dry dock as an attraction next year.
Mr Jackie Cannon, one of 13 shipwrights working on the Trincomalee, said
that the marina was once a local joke. 'People thought, who'll come there?
But I can see people coming here now,' he said.
Teesside Development Corporation estimates public and private-sector
investment in the marina will reach Pounds 170m.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Minister attacks growth of seaside jobless hostels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday resisted its de-regulatory instincts in an attempt
to halt the trend towards the conversion of seaside hotels into social
security benefit hostels.
Mr David Curry, the local government minister, said hotel owners would have
to apply for council planning consent before using their premises as
hostels.
Mr Curry said: 'What is happening at present is that you can convert your
seaside hotel to a hostel which then houses benefit claimants without any
form of authorisation or planning permission.'
The shift, foreshadowed by Mr John Major in an interview with the Sunday
Express, is a response to the growing clamour from predominantly
Conservative councils for action to halt the influx of benefit claimants to
coastal resorts.
The councils, backed in recent months by vigorous lobbying from Conservative
MPs, argue that the influx is keeping away holidaymakers and business
visitors.
Mr Curry stressed that existing hostels would be unaffected and hotels
denied planning permission in future would have the right of appeal.
Ministers acknowledged privately that the measures - which would be in place
before the local elections - contradicted the government's commitment to cut
the burden of regulation on small business. But political benefits for the
government were judged to outweigh economic costs.

Asda has signalled that it intends to sharpen its strategic focus on pricing
in a move which will add to competitive pressures in the UK grocery market,
Robert Corzine writes.
It wants to reduce one-off, promotional price cuts in favour of everyday low
pricing. Such a policy puts pressure on suppliers to reduce their prices.
This is the latest development in a steady drive to prepare for saturation
in the industry by focusing on low prices and removing as many costs as
possible.

Labour may lose 'scores of seats' in the May council elections, Mr Jack
Straw, shadow environment secretary, said yesterday. The party captured many
of the seats to be fought this year when they were last contested, and would
have to fight very hard to keep them all. His comments on BBC1's On the
Record came as a survey for the programme by the BBC's political research
unit showed Labour could suffer mixed results in England. It suggested that
Labour might capture about 140 seats from the Tories, but lose 50 others to
them. It said Labour might win about 10 seats from the Liberal Democrats,
but might lose as many as 150 to them.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Accountancy agreement brings merger closer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's six leading accountancy bodies have agreed in principle to a
radical restructuring of their operations in a move that could lead to
merger. This would give more than 200,000 members of the profession the
right to call themselves chartered accountants.
In a statement expected next week, the six professional bodies plan to
announce principles leading to rationalisation. Details of the agreement,
developed by a sub-committee chaired by Mr David Bishop of KPMG Peat
Marwick, are still being finalised.
Worries about smaller bodies being swallowed by larger ones, and concerns
about variable quality and strategy have prevented significant mergers since
the 1950s.
The idea of reducing the number of bodies was given renewed emphasis last
week when Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said fewer
accountancy organisations would better serve members' interests and make
them more effective in lobbying government.
When the last radical proposals to merge the professional bodies failed in
1970, they created the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies, which
has proved unsatisfactory.
The present accountancy bodies' sub-committee, chaired by Mr Bishop, has
agreed 14 principles of rationalisation, which will be tested on a sample of
the bodies' members.
The statement is expected to say that all the bodies accept the need for
change, and to set out a series of objectives for the accountancy profession
into the next century.
Until now, it has only been possible for members of the three chartered
institutes of accountancy to call themselves 'chartered accountants'.
More detailed debates about the structure of a rationalised profession will
begin, including the way in which education and training will be provided,
and the structure and governance of any merged bodies.
One of the more likely outcomes would be a federal structure, with separate
bodies representing all accountants in Scotland, Ireland, and England and
Wales. Each of the three bodies would include divisions catering for the
different interest groups, such as small and large firms, public practice
and accountants in business, and the public sector. A small, central body
with elected or co-opted members from the regional institutes would deal
with issues such as ethics, regulation, auditing standards, international
liaison, and some lobbying. Jobs would be lost among the 1,200 staff of the
different bodies.
Those most cautious about rationalisation are the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of Scotland and the Chartered Association of Certified
Accountants, which have stated their preference for an intermediate stage of
'harmonisation' before considering whether to permit full rationalisation.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Judge to probe exam allegations
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cardiff University of Wales has appointed a retired judge, Mr Norman
Francis, to investigate allegations that examination papers from its
business school were sold in advance to students in Italy last year.
Mr Francis is looking into the links between Cardiff Business School and the
European Business School in Parma.
In 1992 the University of Wales - a federal institution of which Cardiff is
the largest part - agreed to validate Parma's business studies degree. Last
year the founders of EBS lost control of the business school to a group of
parents, at least some of whom were alleged to have Mafia connections.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Defence chief quits as affair is alleged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Air Marshal Sir Peter Harding, chief of the Defence Staff, resigned last
night after a newspaper alleged that he was having an affair with the former
wife of a retired Conservative politician, Robert Corzine and Philip
Stephens write.
A Ministry of Defence statement said that Sir Peter had tendered his
resignation with immediate effect and that Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence
secretary, had accepted it.
The News of the World alleged there had been an affair between Sir Peter and
Lady Bienvenida Buck, ex-wife of Sir Anthony Buck, a former navy minister.
Their marriage broke up last year.
Sir Peter Inge, the army chief of staff and the most senior of the three
service chiefs, becomes temporary chief of the Defence Staff. He will stay
in the post until a permanent successor is appointed by Mr John Major, the
prime minister.
The resignation, which came within hours of the revelations about Sir
Peter's private life, was in line with the much tougher line on personal
conduct ordered by Mr Major after a spate of ministerial scandals earlier
this year.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Veterans of Hedge End must scale the inner-city heights:
Fresh objectives for the Liberal Democrats in the elections run-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liberal Democrats came to Cardiff seeking reassurance. The 1,300
delegates left convinced that the party's much-forecast breakthrough is once
again just round the corner. This time they could be right.
The Liberal Democrats trail Labour by about 25 percentage points in most
national opinion polls. But the party could be the biggest gainer from the
triple round of local, European and parliamentary elections due by early
June.
The biggest boost could come in the Eastleigh by-election, expected on May
5, in which Mr David Chidgey, the Liberal Democrat candidate, is widely
expected to win the seat from the Conservatives.
The omens are good. The Liberal Democrats hold 19 of the 25 seats on
Eastleigh district council and last week won the last Conservative seat on
Hedge End town council, in the heart of the constituency. A victory would
return the party's national profile to heights not reached since last
summer's by-election successes in Newbury and Christchurch.
But the party is also well-placed for the local elections due on May 5 and
the European Parliament poll on June 9. In both contests the tide is running
in the Liberal Democrats' favour.
Party leaders say they have realistic hopes of two or three victories in the
European Parliament election. But an independent forecast by the Electoral
Reform Society says the Liberal Democrats could win up to a dozen seats.
Most of the local polls are in urban areas where Labour is defending seats
and the Liberal Democrats are more credible challengers than the unpopular
Conservatives.
The party, which has 4,250 council seats across the country, compared with
800 held by the former Liberal party 15 years ago, won a net 78 seats in
by-elections last year, mostly from the Conservatives. Labour failed to
record a single net gain.
Good results in all three rounds of polling would go a long way to
consolidate the party's gradual breakout from its traditional heartlands in
Scotland, Wales and south-west England.
But while the party's prospects are clearly improving, the Cardiff
conference showed that growing maturity is bringing fresh problems in its
wake.
The first is technical: how to switch from fighting the Conservatives in
largely rural seats to fighting Labour in the cities. The answer, drafted
largely by party leaders with big city credentials, such as Mr Simon Hughes,
MP for Bermondsey, is to sharpen the party's image on issues which are
important to urban voters.
The main vehicle for the urban campaign is the policy document Reclaiming
the City, approved by delegates on Saturday. It commits the party to
decentralisation, radical reform of planning law and tough action against
racism.
Mr Hughes, who admits that political progress is harder for the Liberal
Democrats in the towns than in the countryside, warned delegates that they
could not hope to take power at Westminster until they demonstrated their
ability to run the cities.
But divisions are emerging between the party's urban activists and some of
its leaders. They accuse the leadership of trying to stifle debate on
controversial inner-city issues such as prostitution and a row over alleged
racist campaigning by Liberal Democrat activists in the London borough of
Tower Hamlets, the only large inner-city local authority controlled by the
party.
Mr Peter Hughes, leader of the Tower Hamlets Liberal Democrat councillors,
accused the leadership of 'hypocrisy' over its decision to expel three local
members. Ms Gwyneth Deakins, chairman of the Tower Hamlets party, announced
her decision to stand down in protest at the leadership's lack of
understanding of the problems faced by inner-city campaigners.
The second problem is more fundamental: what does the party stand for? The
dilemma was highlighted in a thoughtful speech to a fringe meeting by Mr
Matthew Taylor, MP for Truro, who pointed out that 'we have a higher profile
on Bosnia than on any bread-and-butter domestic policy issue that . . .
determines how people vote.'
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, sought to refocus the party
on domestic issues as he launched a 100-day campaign for the forthcoming
local council, Commons and European elections.
In his keynote speech to the conference Mr Ashdown highlighted education,
employment, taxation and the economy as core issues.
Among a list of 40 policy commitments were free nursery education for
children aged three and four, and a minimum of two days a week of training
for those aged 16 to 19.
Mr Ashdown said the Liberal Democrats would turn welfare payments into
working benefits by giving subsidies to employers to take on the long-term
unemployed.
The difficulty of communicating core values worries other leaders. Mr
Charles Kennedy, party president, said that the claim that Liberal Democrats
were trying to be all things to all people 'hurts and does damage'. It is a
charge to which the party does not have a convincing answer.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Newspaper resumes Pergau onslaught
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Financial Times Reporter
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Sunday Times, whose coverage of the Pergau dam affair was cited by
Malaysia as the spark for its ban on contracts to British companies,
yesterday returned to the attack, accusing the British government of
'grovelling' to the Malaysians.
Mr Andrew Neil, the editor, last week sent the Malaysian government a copy
of a letter signed by him and printed in The Times saying his paper had 'no
vendetta against Malaysia or its prime minister' Dr Mahathir Mohamad.
Sources close to the Malaysian government described the letter as a 'step in
the right direction', which might help restore relations.
Yesterday the newspaper devoted a front-page article and three inside pages
to the affair, including allegations about the role of Dr Mahatir's
associates. In its Comment column the Sunday Times reiterated that it had
nothing to apologise for and attacked Mr Richard Needham, the trade
minister, who had accused the newspaper of putting jobs at risk. Describing
him as 'an obscure political pigmy', it said he is 'prepared to wear out his
kneepads kowtowing before the Malaysians'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Computer memory chips worth Pounds 2.3m were stolen over the weekend from a
Renfrewshire electronics company owned by the Red Cross.
The raid on the Haven Products factory in Greenock is believed to be the
largest in a series of chip thefts throughout Europe in recent months.
Strathclyde Police said at least three raiders - masked and brandishing
metal bars - held the factory security guard hostage while they loaded boxes
of memory chips from the stores into a Haven Products lorry stolen from
another site.
Haven Products was founded in 1946 to provide work for people wounded in the
second world war. It was taken over by the British Red Cross in the early
1960s and employs 150 people, of whom 90 are disabled.

FT  14 MAR 94 / First warehouse club opening
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's first British-owned warehouse club, selling goods in bulk at
discount prices, opens tomorrow in Croydon, south London, Neil Buckley
writes.
Cargo Club, operated by UK cash-and-carry company Nurdin and Peacock, is the
second US-style warehouse club to open in Britain. The first was opened in
November at Thurrock, Essex, by Costco Europe, 60 per cent owned by the
largest US club operator PriceCostco, with partners Littlewoods of the UK
and France's Carrefour.
Cargo Club remains close to the original US concept of the warehouse club -
a broad but selective range in no-frills surroundings; grocery products sold
mostly in bulk quantities; and an annual membership fee of Pounds 25.
Mr Mark Riches, managing director (above), says Cargo Club has been
carefully tailored to British tastes and needs. 'We are trying to appeal to
a wider audience than Costco,' he said.
Cargo Club plans further stores this year in Wednesbury, West Midlands, and
Bristol, and four more stores in 1995, with an eventual target of 30. Costco
is building stores at Bushey, Hertfordshire, and in Liverpool.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Business TV hunts for cash rescue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Accountancy Television, the financially troubled training service for
accountants, is urgently seeking Pounds 500,000 after its shareholders
refused recent approaches to provide additional support.
Details emerged as all the remaining original supporters were preparing to
write off their investments in the service, which was launched two years ago
as a late-night encoded subscription service transmitted on the BBC.
Sir Michael Lickiss, chairman of Accountancy Television, said the company
needed at least Pounds 200,000 to survive.
But he was optimistic over discussions with a venture capital company. He
said: 'I am very optimistic that in the very, very short term I will be able
to make a satisfactory announcement.'
The three institutes of chartered accountants covering the UK and Ireland,
and the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants are expected to write
off shareholdings totalling Pounds 500,000.
Last year the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants, BBC Select,
which provides the encoded transmission service, and BPP, the training
company, wrote off their investments.
The original business plan, which Sir Michael described as 'grossly
optimistic', projected that the company would break even later this year. He
said it was now on target to break even next year under plans drawn up last
autumn.
He said that the service had 1,200 subscribers, about equally split between
the TV service and a video service using some of the same material, which
was launched last year. He added that he was discussin plans to introduce
'down-loading' of training programmes by video.
Accountancy Television, described by one insider as 'a poisoned chalice',
pitched its commercial backers against those from the professional
accountancy bodies.
In the past few months the chief executive of the company has left and the
post has been temporarily filled by one of the remaining four staff.
Recent requests for several hundreds of thousands of pounds in additional
money were rejected by the accountancy bodies, which had provided a second
injection after their initial investment in 1992.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Israel moves to ban extremist Jewish groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Two extremist anti-Arab Jewish groups were banned and branded as terrorist
by Israel yesterday, in a move designed to bring the Palestine Liberation
Organisation back to the suspended Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
The concession to the PLO came after Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, said a
package of guarantees allowing the Palestinians to return to the peace
negotiations may be reached at today's meeting in Vladivostok between Mr
Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, and Mr Warren Christopher, US
secretary of state. The two countries are co-sponsors of the Middle East
peace process.
PLO officials said yesterday under the agreement Russia and the US would
back a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning last month's
Hebron mosque massacre and providing for the deployment of an international
force in the territories to help protect Palestinian lives. Israel would
promise to speed up the peace talks on implementing Palestinian self-rule
and would complete a military withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and West Bank
area of Jericho by April 13. In return the PLO would resume talks in
Washington and Paris next Monday.
The outlawing of Kehane Lives and Kach, two militant orthodox Jewish groups
which glorify violence against Palestinians in the Israeli occupied
territories, has been one of the PLO demands for returning to talks. Both
groups, which have only a handful of activists, are followers of Rabbi Meir
Kehane, a slain Jewish racist who believed violence against Arabs sanctify
Jews, reveal God's glory and bring the coming of the Messiah closer.
Kach has been banned from parliamentary politics since 1988 because of its
racist electoral platform which demanded prison terms for Arabs and Jews who
had sexual relations. Mr Baruch Goldstein, the Jewish settler who massacred
30 Palestinians in a Hebron Mosque last month, was a member of Kach.
Mr Michael Ben-Yair, attorney general, compared the two organisations with
the Islamic extremist Hamas movement which rejects peace talks and advocates
violence against Jews. Mr Ben-Yair said the two groups wanted to create a
Jewish theocracy in the biblical land of Israel and force the 2m
Palestinians living in the territories to leave.
The cabinet unanimously endorsed the ban after reports from the police and
internal security that members of the two organisations were involved in
murders of Arabs.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Nigerian policies 'set to fail'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nigeria's new economic policies 'are definitely going to fail', Mr Kim
Jaycox, World Bank vice-president for Africa, warned at the weekend.
In the most forthright public criticism by a World Bank official since
Nigeria's military government revalued the currency, the naira, in last
January's budget, Mr Jaycox said: 'There is just no way they are going to
succeed, and I think that they have got to be reversed.'
He was speaking at a Washington news conference to mark the publication of
the bank's report: Adjustment in Africa.
'These are not acceptable ways of managing an economy,' Mr Jaycox said.
'They have already tried this (a fixed exchange rate) in Nigeria many times.
It has all come to major failure, and so it surprises us that they would be
doing this again.'
Nigeria was one of six countries credited in the report with a 'large
improvement' in macroeconomic policies between 1987 and 1991.
But the impetus that marked the reform programme fell away towards the end
of the 1980s and, over the last two years, many of the benefits of reform
have been lost.
The single greatest blow was the 1994 budget. General Sani Abacha, Nigeria's
new military leader, fixed the exchange rate of the naira to the US dollar
at nearly twice the market rate.
Hopes for the renewal of a lapsed agreement with the International Monetary
Fund have been dashed, and rescheduling of Nigeria's external debt is
unlikely to take place this year.
Arrears on the Dollars 28bn (Pounds 18.7bn) debt exceed Dollars 6bn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A crisis was unfolding in the eastern Malaysian state of Sabah last night,
as local leaders and the state governor clashed over whether the state
assembly could be dissolved and new elections held.
In a bitter state election less than a month ago, the locally based Parti
Bersatu Sabah (PBS), led by Mr Joseph Pairin Kitingan, Sabah's chief
minister, narrowly defeated Malaysia's ruling National Front coalition led
by Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister.
At the weekend, three PBS deputies to Sabah's state assembly announced they
were joining the National Front.
Mr Pairin said he had no alternative but to dissolve the assembly and call
fresh elections. The chief minister said he had followed the constitution in
obtaining the Sabah governor's signature to authorise the dissolution.
At a news conference last night, Mr Pairin distributed what he said were
copies of the signed document. But, on national news broadcasts controlled
by the federal government, the governor denied signing and accused Mr Pairin
of 'mischievous and unbecoming behaviour.'
Dr Mahathir has made no secret of his antagonism towards the PBS and to Mr
Pairin in particular. After the PBS election victory, Mr Pairin was forced
to wait for 36 hours outside the gates of the Sabah governor's house before
being sworn in as chief minister.

FT  14 MAR 94 / US crosses swords with China over human rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, has told Chinese officials
that time is running out for China to improve its human rights behaviour or
risk losing its preferential trade status in the US.
His warning came in a weekend of bruising exchanges over human rights. The
wrangle threatens a trading relationship worth more than Dollars 40bn
(Pounds 26.7bn) last year, heavily in China's favour.
Chinese leaders dropped diplomatic niceties to tell Mr Christopher to mind
his own business on human rights.
Premier Li Peng said it was 'futile' to apply pressure over human rights.
'China will never accept the US human rights concept,' he declared.
Mr Christopher's mission was in danger of unravelling after sometimes
acrimonious encounters with both Mr Li and Mr Qian Qichen, foreign minister.
'I emphasised to China that time is of the essence. . . as we move into the
next critical two months before I have to make my recommendation to
President Clinton' on the renewal of Most Favoured Nation trading status, Mr
Christopher told reporters.
Mr Li warned Mr Christopher that the US 'will lose its share of the big
Chinese market' if it withdraws China's trading privileges.
The arrest of prominent dissidents before Mr Christopher arrived in Beijing
cast a pall over his mission. Detention at the weekend of several foreign
journalists - who were trying to contact dissidents - further clouded the
atmosphere.
The US wants the release of jailed dissidents, human rights improvements in
Tibet, permission for the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit
Chinese prisons, and a less rigid attitude to emigration.
China appeared ready late last year to respond to US concerns, but fears of
civil unrest over rising prices and signs that dissidents were becoming more
active appear to have prompted a fresh crackdown.
The US business community in Beijing, meanwhile, was openly critical of
Washington's approach to China at an American Chamber of Commerce breakfast
meeting yesterday.
'Choices facing our government are historic - either we engage China as a
partner in managing regional security, economic growth and economic
stability or we become adversaries,' said the representative in Beijing of
AT&amp;T, the telecoms group.

Ms Carmen Lawrence, the former premier of Western Australia who is tipped
for high office in the Australian Labor party, is due in Canberra today
having won a decisive victory in a Fremantle by-election at the weekend.
Ms Lawrence received 59 per cent of the votes, a swing of 1 per cent towards
the ALP. The result is seen as a personal triumph for Ms Lawrence given the
unpopularity of the Labor party in Western Australia.
The Fremantle seat was previously held by Mr John Dawkins, former federal
treasurer, who has left politics.
Ms Lawrence is likely to be given ministerial responsibilities almost
immediately.

<TEXT>
China, fearful of unrest caused by sharp increases in the cost of living,
has taken a step back from its price reforms by authorising price controls
on 20 basic items, writes Tony Walker in Beijing.
The official Economic Daily yesterday published a State Council (cabinet)
decree en-abling local authorities to 'make appropriate interference' in the
market. Items covered include wheat flour, rice, edible oil, coal and fees
for schools and hospitals. China had claimed it had deregulated markets for
all but a handful of staple items.
The cabinet decision reflects concern over the risks posed to public order
by sharp rises in the cost of living. Inflation in China's 35 largest cities
reached 23.3 per cent in January compared with the same month last year.
China has vowed to bring inflation below 10 per cent over the next year or
so but is having difficulty calming an over-heating economy that grew by
more than 13 per cent last year.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Algerian raid frees militants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Algerian security forces at the weekend sought at least 900 prisoners,
mostly Islamic militants, freed by a 150-strong commando in the most daring
armed operation in the country's two years of internal violence, writes
Francis Ghiles.
The raid on the fortified Tazult prison, 400km south-east of Algiers,
supports evidence that much of Algeria is beyond the control of the armed
forces.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Japanese drug price cuts to average 6.6%

Pharmaceutical price cuts announced late last week by Japan's ministry of
health and welfare will reduce prices by 6.6 per cent on average.
The cuts are based on a complicated formula related to the level of
discounts offered by manufacturers to wholesalers. They are due to be
implemented on April 1, further slowing growth of Japan's prescription drugs
market.
Sankyo, the country's second largest drugs group, was among those worst hit,
suffering an average 8.1 per cent reduction on its eight top selling
products, according to brokers Lehman Brothers. Zantac, the world's
top-selling product which Sankyo markets for Glaxo of the UK, suffered a
10.3 per cent price reduction.
Sankyo was particularly hit because the ministry introduced a special 12.2
per cent price cut for Mevalotin, a cholesterol-lowering drug which is
Japan's biggest-selling medicine, with estimated annual sales last year of
Y99.6bn (Pounds 630m). Banyu, the subsidiary of Merck, the US group, was
also the victim of a 12.2 per cent special price cut on Lipovas, its
cholesterol treatment.
The special cuts have upset the industry because they are targeted at
particularly successful medicines, and are not based on the usual formula.
Interferons, used to treat hepatitis and cancer, were also subject to
special reductions. Sales of cholesterol-lowering drugs increased more than
20 per cent last year in Japan.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Hopes for global green fund at meeting today
</HEADLINE>

Delegates from 80 countries are meeting in Geneva today in an effort to
reach agreement on setting up a Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) Global
Environment Facility to help developing countries deal with climate change,
water pollution, threats to biodiversity and ozone depletion.
A pilot GEF has been operating since 1991 under the wing of the World Bank
and the United Nations Development Programme, but the 1992 Earth Summit in
Rio de Janeiro agreed to reorganise the facility and give it new resources.
Member countries failed, however, to reach agreement on the rules and
structures of the new GEF at a meeting in Colombia, in December, as
delegates from many developing nations began to question whether the richer
industrialised countries were cooling on their promise to provide Dollars
2bn for the fund.
Mr Mohamed el-Ashry, GEF chairman, is optimistic that agreement can be
reached in Geneva, but he warns that time is running out for the
negotiations. 'While all the indications point towards agreement, I also
feel this could be the last opportunity for governments to put together a
GEF,' he said last week.
Other participants agree both with his optimism and with his warning that
the window of opportunity could close.
Developed countries have reaffirmed their commitment to a target of Dollars
2bn for the facility, divided among them roughly in line with a formula
based on their shares in the International Development Association, the soft
loan window of the World Bank.
The US, the largest contributor, is offering Dollars 430m, about Dollars 20m
less than the IDA formula would require, and France and perhaps Italy have
threatened to reduce their contributions in line with the US. Australia and
Spain will also give slightly less than the formula.
US officials are unapologetic, however, about what they see as a substantial
contribution in a very difficult budget environment. 'It's a little unfair
for others to use us as an excuse,' a US Treasury official said.
Japan, the second largest contributor, is expected to come up with its full
share of just over Dollars 400m, likewise the UK with its share of over
Dollars 130m.
With contributions from half a dozen developing countries, the total would
probably come to about Dollars 1.9bn, which GEF officials hope would be
enough to avert a collapse in negotiations, and which could be topped up
later with money from countries not involved in the talks.
With the issue of money out of the way, delegates in Geneva must resolve
their remaining differences on the new GEF's procedures.
These differences have for the most part been over whether the GEF should be
run more along the lines of the UN and its spin-offs - an approach favoured
by the developing countries - or like the World Bank and the other Bretton
Woods institutions, as the developed countries prefer.
Perhaps most contentious is whether the council should be chaired, like the
World Bank, by the chief executive, or by one of the country
representatives, like the UN.
Mr el-Ashry believes that the GEF countries have moved much closer to an
agreement since the Colombian meeting: 'We have gone a long way towards
putting together something that can stand the test of efficiency and
effectiveness, while at the same time having political acceptability.'

FT  14 MAR 94 / White House fights back on Whitewater: Jurek Martin senses
that a new strategy is starting to emerge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The outlines of a new White House strategy to recover from the debilitating
Whitewater affair have begun to emerge over the last few days, according to
senior officials preferring to speak off the record.
Prominent will be the emergence of Mrs Hillary Clinton back into the public
domain, following more than a week when controversy about her role in the
complex tale of family financial and land dealings in Arkansas had driven
her into relative seclusion.
Two weekly news magazines will publish today interviews with her in which
she confesses to 'mis-steps' in White House handling of the affair and an
underestimation on her part of media interest in it. A news conference or TV
interview, with or without her husband, is also being considered.
The White House sense is that Mrs Clinton's 'moral authority', both as a
policy adviser and role model, has been damaged but is by no means beyond
repair. President Bill Clinton's public schedule, which took him to Detroit
yesterday for today's Group of Seven jobs conference, will also be stepped
up.
Officials admit he has been much distracted over the last ten days by
Whitewater and particularly want him to turn his attention back to several
pressing foreign policy issues, such as relations with China and Russia,
Bosnia and, possibly, putting the new Nato 'partnership for peace' with
eastern Europe on a faster track.
Mr Lloyd Cutler, recruited last week as new White House legal counsel, has
already emerged as a leading designated spokesman, with the mission to
assure both public and press that no crimes were committed and no cover-up
undertaken. Yesterday, for example, he appeared on all three TV network
Sunday shows, a rare occurrence.
His presence, taken together with the fact that both the Clintons are now
consulting more widely with senior staff who had been frozen out of the
internal Whitewater deliberations, seems to have lifted some of the
demoralised gloom inside the White House that touched a nadir when the
federal grand jury issued subpoenas to senior staff.
Mr Joel Klein, the deputy counsel who joined the White House last December
to fill the late Mr Vincent Foster's shoes, is also given much credit for
ensuring no stone was unturned in delivering documents to the grand jury. He
is said to have established an excellent working relationship with Mr Robert
Fiske, the independent counsel, and this has contributed to what is hoped to
be a growing impression in the media that the White House is holding nothing
back.
Mr Cutler said on NBC yesterday his investigations included 'accusations
relating to possible Clinton involvement' in the death of Mr Foster. He did
not eleborate.
The media mood itself is currently quite fickle. Absent any new revelations,
several publications in the last 48 hours have run self-critical articles
about Whitewater reporting overkill. Opinion polls depict a public still
less than consumed by the affair.
A critical element to the White House strategy is to get political and
public focus back on the president's domestic programmes. Last Friday's
comfortable passage by the House of the 1994-95 budget, with only marginal
changes to the administration blueprint, was a substantial victory for the
president but received perfunctory media coverage, in sharp contrast to last
year's budget drama when Mr Clinton prevailed by just one vote.
One option is to try to make an early deal with Congress on healthcare
reform, incorporating some basic elements of the Clinton plan, including
universal coverage, but with concessions to more modest versions advanced by
both conservative Democrats and moderate Republicans.
This approach is being pushed by the less ardent supporters of the Clinton
plan and, therefore, may encounter resistance from the First Lady, its chief
architect. The counter argument is that public support for the plan is
ebbing and failure to cut a deal soon may mean loss of any chance to pass
healthcare this year.
The second option is to try to reach early accommodation with House
Republicans on a crime bill comparable to that approved by the Senate last
year. This would take up a popular issue and would exploit some Republican
nervousness about being seen to hold the legislative programme hostage to
Whitewater.
White House tacticians sense a tendency on the part of the Republican
Whitewater assault troops to overplay their hand. Over the weekend, several
prominent Democrats took to attacking the record of Senator Al D'Amato of
New York, a leading Whitewater critic whose own ethical history is studded
with controversy.
However, further personnel sacrifices from the administration are far from
excluded. The most likely candidate appears to be Mr Webster Hubbell, now
the associate attorney-general and previously Mrs Clinton's law partner in
Arkansas. He has been accused of assorted ethical improprieties, not all
related to Whitewater.
Also vulnerable is Mr Roger Altman, deputy treasury secretary, who initiated
meetings with White House officials to discuss the status of federal
investigations into the failed savings and loan at the heart of Whitewater.
However, late last week, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, treasury secretary, delivered a
pep talk to senior treasury staff on the imperative of rallying behind Mr
Altman.
Beneath this guarded sense of recovery lies the fear of further damaging
accusations and revelations. As fas as Whitewater itself is concerned,
senior officials believe that the worst that could happen is that Mr and Mrs
Clinton might be forced into a civil settlement, such as payment of back
taxes.
This could be harmful - but not fatal - to his political future, especially
if the economic recovery continues. However, so balkanised has the White
House become that extensive knowledge, both of Whitewater and of the events
of the last nine months which are sometimes portrayed as a cover-up, is not
widely spread, even in the upper reaches of the executive branch.
