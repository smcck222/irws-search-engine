Mr Manuel Camacho Sols, the Mexican government's peace envoy in the southern
state of Chiapas, has indicated he might run for national office if the
government did not approve democratic reforms under discussion for the
country and failed to comply with the recent peace accord for the rebels in
Chiapas.
He thereby resisted rising pressure from his colleagues in the governing
party to rule himself out of the presidential race.
The party's 65-year hold on power could be jeopardised if Mr Camacho, a
former mayor of Mexico City and an ex-foreign minister, were to realise his
veiled threat to run as an opposition candidate in the presidential election
in August.
'If there are no advances in democracy and if, instead of accord, there is
polarisation and if anyone wants to trample on my political rights as a
citizen, then after I have fulfilled my mission in Chiapas, I will take the
necessary political decision to bring democracy and unity to Mexico,' Mr
Camacho told reporters.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Support for S American free trade area
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Brazil's proposal to create a South American free trade area has won the
backing of the country's three partners in Mercosur, the regional common
market planned to come into effect next year.
Brazil and its partners Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay agreed last week to
begin negotiating the proposal with other countries in the second half of
this year, after final arrangements for Mercosur are agreed.
Mr Jose Arthur Denot Medeiros, responsible for Mercosur at the Brazilian
foreign ministry, said the idea for the free trade area, first suggested
last year, is an extension of Mercosur and designed to increase trade in the
continent: 'This should be seen as a further trade liberalisation move to
make South America eventually ready for some kind of convergency with an
expanded North American Free Trade Agreement.'
The free trade area is expected to go into effect over ten years from 1995.
It will be defined to cover 'substantially all' goods, or at least 80 per
cent of trade. Unlike Mercosur, the area would aim to create a customs
union, although some countries may be invited to join Mercosur at a later
stage.
Mr Denot Medeiros said the proposal was not designed as a response or
competitor to Nafta. Brazil believes the two entities could be complementary
and that some countries could be members of both. Chile, expected to be the
next invited to join Nafta, would also be an important member of the South
American area, he said.
Brazil's idea has received so far only a lukewarm response from other South
American countries. Some were awaiting a formal decision on whether to
proceed from the four Mercosur countries.
There have also been occasionally confusing signals from Argentina on its
commitment to Mercosur, after disagreement with Brazil over the rate of
common external tariffs to be applied. Tariffs on about 85 per cent of goods
have already been agreed and the two countries have until June to agree
tariffs on the remainder.

FT  14 MAR 94 / US and Europe reach rare consensus: All agree on need for
greater labour flexibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An unusual consensus has emerged - at least between the US and Europe - from
the dozens of papers produced by governments and think-tanks for the Group
of Seven jobs summit, which is to begin in Detroit today, even if there has
been no new big idea for solving the developed world's unemployment problem.
The three main voices in the debate - the US, the UK and the continental
European - backed by economists at the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development, are all emphasising a combination of greater
labour market flexibility, easier enterprise formation, more effective
active labour market measures and improvements in education and training.
There is even a broad consensus around one of the central causes of
unemployment in the developed world: that a combination of trade with
developing countries and technological change has permanently reduced demand
for less-skilled labour. Benefit systems and minimum wages put a floor under
unskilled wages in Europe, so the fall in demand has shown in rising
unemployment. In the US, on the other hand, the problem is expressed in
falling wages or resort to crime.
The policy challenge is to move as many people as possible into high-skill
jobs, while ensuring that labour markets are flexible enough to soak up the
rest without forcing down incomes too far. By their attendance at the
summit, all G7 countries implicitly accept that social engineering to deal
with this collapse in demand for unskilled labour, and to cut the time lag
between the destruction of old jobs and the creation of new ones, is
justified.
In political terms, both free-market liberals, represented most strongly by
the UK government, and social/Christian democrats, represented by
continental Europe and the European Commission, can sign to such a
combination of ideas. A Democratic administration in the US, interested in
European welfare and training systems but still wedded to many aspects of
its own flexible labour market, hovers between the two.
But the idea of mid-Atlantic convergence can also be misleading, because the
meeting point is far closer to the US than to the European coast. Indeed,
the starting point of the most influential analysis is considerably more
liberal and competitiveness-conscious than a decade ago.
The emphasis in Europe is on repairing the poor capacity of its economies to
create new jobs. In the US, which has produced 2m new jobs in the past 18
months, the emphasis is on producing higher-skilled, higher-paid jobs.
All the main parties to the debate, including the traditionally orthodox
OECD, are also careful to avoid advocating US-style wage differentials, and
real wage cuts (in 1972-1992 US average real wages fell by about 10 per
cent). Even the UK government, the strongest admirer of the US model, talks
about the balance to be struck between market forces and regulation.
The main clusters of ideas on the Detroit agenda are:
Wage and regulatory flexibility. The OECD has long advocated that Europe
increase its labour cost flexibility and reform its job security provisions.
The most surprising recent convert to this orthodoxy has been the European
Commission. The European Commission's White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness
and Employment, published at the end of last year, talks about a new
solidarity between the employed and the unemployed, and about 'remodelled'
regulation rather than de-regulation. But it pulls few punches on the
problems of European rigidity. It says that many social protection schemes
and wage bargaining systems have had a negative impact on employment,
protecting those in work at the expense of job-seekers, and says that there
is broad consensus from member states on the need for greater flexibility
and lower labour costs.
The most concrete policy proposal to create more jobs for the less skilled
and increase the 'employment-intensity' of the services sector is to
increase the burden of non-wage labour costs as incomes rise. At present,
the proportion falls as incomes rise in most European countries.
The US paper circulated to governments before the summit also stresses that
the main policy requirement for Europe - and Japan - is to reduce
restrictions on wage setting and employment adjustment which reduce the
incentives of the unemployed to find jobs and the incentives of employers to
create them.
Training, education and good jobs. The US paper says that, in the right
climate of innovation and entrepreneurship, new technology creates as many
jobs as it destroys. But, if all citizens are to qualify for these jobs, the
standards of basic education and training must be improved, especially in
the US, and the school-to-work transition must be better handled.
Active labour markets and more flexible welfare. The annual cost of
unemployment in the EU - including foregone income - is more than Ecu200bn
(Pounds 151bn) each year, greater than the GDP of Belgium. In recent years,
there has been a small shift towards active labour market measures -
training, job placement, and so on - but more than two-thirds of direct
spending on unemployment still goes on passive measures.
The challenge is to find ways of boosting the incomes of the unskilled in a
more economically efficient manner than just leaving them on benefits. The
problem is that Europe's social security systems were designed on the
assumption of full-time employment and have failed to adapt to the growth of
part-time and 'atypical' employment. Individuals find it difficult to move
from unemployment into anything other than full-time work because of the
steep claw-back of benefits.
Disagreements and other views. There are, of course, differences of emphasis
between the main participants, with most European countries playing down
cyclical factors and playing up structural factors, while the US still
believes that a good part of the unemployment problem is linked to low
growth.
'Countries which pursue structural improvements, without taking steps to
increase aggregate demand, will see little or no return for their efforts,'
warns the US paper. Japan, with the best record of any G7 country on jobs in
recent years, also warns in its otherwise orthodox paper against too much
emphasis on labour flexibility. 'Excessive mobility of workers discourages
incentives to enhance human resource development by enterprises,' it warns.
One idea - not on the Detroit agenda - which runs strongly counter to
economic orthodoxy is work-sharing. The EU White Paper was ambivalent about
it, rejecting 'a generalised reduction in working hours and job-sharing at
national level'.
Even so, as a preferable alternative to widespread redundancies for
companies in short-term trouble, reduced working time will remain on the
broader agenda.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Looking forward to a plan in Naples

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Finance and employment ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial
nations gathered in Detroit last night for a two-day brainstorming session
on ways to tackle the persistent unemployment in their economies.
US officials hosting the jobs conference insist there will be no final
communique and no attempt at formal policy co-ordination, but President Bill
Clinton wants to use the conference's conclusions as the basis for the July
summit meeting of G7 leaders in Naples to agree a jobs plan.
For Mr Clinton, who will open the conference this morning, the meeting
offers a chance to focus on themes close to the heart of his administration,
after much distraction by the Whitewater affair.
Ministers from other G7 countries expect the Detroit meeting to agree on the
need for labour market flexibility, investment in education and training,
and open trade.
'We find we are talking from the same agenda,' said Mr David Hunt, UK
employment secretary.
Mr Larry Summers, US Treasury under-secretary for international affairs,
says the employment issue is of critical political importance for all the G7
countries.
But the seven nations are not unanimous on how big a role economic stimulus,
in the form of lower interest rates or tax cuts, should play in an overall
jobs policy.
US officials do not want to turn the Detroit meeting into a shouting match
with Germany's Bundesbank, but they continue to argue that Europe needs
further interest rate cuts to spur growth and job creation.
Ms Laura Tyson, chief White House economist, told the Financial Times that
she is yet to be convinced that Europe's unemployment problems can be as
much explained by structural problems, such as rigid labour market rules, as
her European counterparts argue.
'Between 1986 and 1990, the European G7 countries added about 5m jobs and
the unemployment rate went down from about 9 per cent to about 6.9 per cent.
Since 1990, the unemployment rate has gone up to about 9.2 per cent and the
level of employment has gone down by about 2m,' she noted.
"Unless you are willing to make the case that structural rigidities improved
a lot between 1986 and 1990, and then got worse again, a lot of that
deterioration has to be cyclical.'

FT  14 MAR 94 / Lack of training shuts out poor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When President Bill Clinton first called for a special conference to discuss
jobs and unemployment at the Group of Seven summit in Tokyo last summer, the
US economy was still recovering only anaemically from the 1990 recession,
and unemployment stood at 7 per cent.
Today, as the conference convenes in Detroit, the jobless rate is 6.5 per
cent - despite a change in the method of calculation that makes the figure
higher than under the old system.
Comparing the US record with that of Europe, some US commentators have
sneered at the purpose of the conference.
'Actually, there is no global crisis; there is only a European crisis,'
scoffed Mr Robert Samuelson in the magazine Newsweek. 'We have nothing to
learn from the Europeans about job creation, and the lessons they could
learn from us are the obvious ones that - for political and social reasons -
they can't adopt.'
Clinton administration officials, however, have spent the last week telling
anyone who would listen that, on the contrary, they still have a great deal
to learn from them.
While the US has indeed had much more dynamic job creation than the other G7
countries, they note, real wages in the US have stagnated for years. At the
same time, income disparities between the better trained and educated and
the less well trained have widened dramatically. Whole segments of the
population have been virtually shut out of the job market, with unemployment
approaching 70 per cent in some cases, such as inner-city black teenagers.
'Others could learn from US flexibility and dynamism. We could learn from
what others have done to facilitate the transition from school to work,'
said Mr Larry Summers, the treasury undersecretary for international
affairs.
Looked at over a period of decades, the US has consistently created new jobs
at a strong pace. The number of non-farm jobs grew by an average of 2.2 per
cent a year from 1950 to 1990.
Unemployment, meanwhile, oscillated between 4.9 per cent and 9.7 per cent in
the 1970s and 1980s, much lower than comparable European rates - although
some workers may give up the search for work quicker than they might in
Europe, since US benefits stop after 26 weeks.
At the start of the 1990s, employment stagnated as recession was followed by
a slow recovery which seemed to bring few new jobs in its wake. Last year,
net job creation picked up to 1.8 per cent - more robust, but still weak by
the standards of most post-war recoveries.
A new study by economists Steven Davis, John Haltiwanger and Scott Schuh at
the Census Bureau's Centre for Economic Studies shows that the gross
creation and destruction of jobs that produces these net annual figures is
far more dramatic.
Looking at data from individual manufacturing plants from 1973 to 1988, they
found that in a typical 12-month period 10.3 per cent of jobs disappeared,
while another 9.1 per cent were newly created.
While US workers have been finding jobs, their earnings, adjusted for
inflation, have fared worse. Average weekly earnings in the private sector,
measured in 1982 dollars, climbed from Dollars 261.92 in 1960 to Dollars
315.38 in 1973. Since then, they have slipped back steadily to only Dollars
255.99 at the end of 1993.
Within this overall decline, workers in the highest wages bracket saw their
earnings rise by an average of 4.4 per cent in real terms over the last 20
years, while workers in the bottom wage bracket saw a real fall in earnings
of 10.3 per cent.
Another Census Bureau study published last week shows that 18 per cent of
America's 81m full-time workers earned less than a poverty level wage of
Dollars 13,091 a year, compared with only 12 per cent in 1979.
Some European countries, while they may not have escaped the erosion of real
wages, have avoided this increase in inequality.
This does not just mean that the superior record of job creation in the US
has come entirely in low-wage, low-skill sectors such as fast food
restaurants.
'The US economy has not been producing McJobs disproportionately,' says Ms
Laura Tyson, chair of the White House council of economic advisers. 'We have
been creating jobs in good job classification categories, but that rate of
growth of compensation of those jobs has slowed.'
Some of the pressure on earnings has come from the spiralling cost of health
insurance, which is provided in most cases by employers who generally pass
on around 80 per cent of the costs to their workers in lower wages.
But even measures of total compensation, including health benefits, have
grown at a rate the Clinton administration finds disappointing.
The question ministers will address today and tomorrow is, in the words of
Mr Robert Reich, US labour secretary: 'Are the citizens of advanced
economies condemned to choose between, on the one hand, more jobs which pay
less and less, or good jobs but high levels of unemployment accompanying
those good jobs?
'I think there's a third choice, and that third choice may be to combine the
kind of investments in education and training and apprenticeship that we
find in Europe with the dynamic labour mobility and flexibility we find in
the US, all encased within macro-economic policies which encourage growth
and jobs.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MADRID
Spain's Socialist government has found itself in a role it wanted badly to
avoid - as the villain of the piece, or as they say in Spanish 'the bad guy
in the film', over enlargement of the European Union. But by evoking
'national interests' it has ensured a broad front of support from the
country's press.
Most editorialists gave less importance to the wrangle with Norway over
fishing rights than Spain's demands for minority blocking votes in the
future 16-member EU. The leading Madrid daily El Pais described Spain's
decision to dig its heels in as 'unfortunate, but right'.
At stake was Spain's ability to prevent decisions on crucial issues being
imposed on it. The argument boiled down to 'a struggle to prevent Europe's
centre of gravity being definitively shifted northwards'. It recognised the
quandary this represented for Spain's ostensibly pro-European leaders.
'For some negotiators it is hard to resist the pressure and criticism from
friends, partners and allies. But in this instance there is no other way for
Spain, which favours enlargement, to defend interests of the first
magnitude.'
The right-wing daily ABC said the government's firmness was backed by all
political parties. But the government itelf was partly to blame for the
'terrible' way it negotiated Spain's entry eight years ago, leaving the
country 'in many sectors defenceless against a decision by Brussels.' As for
Norwegian cod, it hoped for 'a logical outcome which would cater for Spain's
legitimate demands without imposing intolerable conditions on Norway.'
The conservative Barcelona newspaper La Vanguardia commented: 'Anyone
shocked by Spain's attitude should also be shocked by the attitude of those
opposing its demands.' Norway, it conceded, was 'perfectly entitled to
defend its interests.' The difference was that the Norwegians were on the
outside trying to get in.
PARIS
Air France's request for FFr20bn (Pounds 2.3bn) in state aid, and the fact
that it accounted for half the losses made by all the world's airlines last
year, occupied much space - but provoked relatively little editorial comment
 -in the French press.
One exception, however, was La Tribune, the business daily, which said that
some would find it 'scandalous that the French taxpayer was having to dig
into his pocket again' to save Air France, and Bull the computer company,
and others 'would reckon that the bills presented by the new bosses of these
companies were a bit steep, even indecent, at a time when private companies
were having to take the risk of going to the markets for new money'.
The distortion of competition was too flagrant not to be noticed, said La
Tribune in language that could have come - and undoubtedly will - out of a
British Airways press release on the Air France aid request.
But the real problem, La Tribune said, was that Air France and Bull had
simply always lived sheltered lives, protected from the market and winds of
competition. Their recent history was a tale of 'money lost, energies wasted
and employees disappointed'.
However, Ouest France, produced in Bordeaux but with the largest circulation
in France, struck a more upbeat note. Mr Christian Blanc, Air France's new
boss had a record of solving knotty problems like the New Caledonian crisis
in the 1980s, and other French companies like Citroen had been able to pull
themselves rapidly together. But it said Air France's problem was that it
essentially lacked a business culture, and 'that will not be settled by a
cheque'.
SANTIAGO
Weekend papers were glowing in their accounts of the presidential handover,
a 'fiesta of democracy' in which Eduardo Frei, in the words of La Nacion,
'arrived in Valparaiso (home to Congress) as a common citizen and returned
to Santiago as president'.
For the most part, editors forgot their political differences and treated
the event as pageant. This was, after all, as La Epoca pointed out, the
first time in nearly 25 years that power had been transferred from one
democratically elected president to another. The last time was in 1970 when
Eduardo Frei's father handed the presidential sash to Salvador Allende.
The man responsible for breaking that sequence, General Augusto Pinochet,
attended Frei's inauguration in his capacity as commander-in-chief of the
armed forces. According to El Mercurio, the general's entrance 'was received
with loud and prolonged applause'. La Epoca noticed that, after the
ceremony, the general did not exit through the front door, but left 'via the
car parks'.
There was much praise for outgoing president Patricio Aylwin, though an
opinion piece in La Tercera thought his government had not properly
administered 'what it had received from its (military) predecessor'.
El Mercurio said that - discounting financial scandal at state copper
company Codelco, and a lax attitude towards crime - Aylwin's presidency 'had
been one of the most auspicious in the country's history'. It hoped
President Frei, a fellow Christian Democrat, would show the same
'moderation'.
La Nacion was less cautious. In a piece headlined 'Four unforgettable years'
it said: 'The historical merit of Aylwin is that he taught us to live in a
democracy once again.' Now that Chileans were not fighting for basic
political freedoms, they could concentrate on social problems, it said.
'Four years ago, it was not like that.'

Shortly after the Nato attack order was rescinded, UN officials reported the
arrival of UN observation teams to Serb-besieged Maglaj.
Under attack by the Serbs since last June, the 19,000 residents of the
Moslem enclave in northern Bosnia have suffered great hardship, with all
land convoys blocked since last October. The latest development appeared to
represent a concession by the Serbs.
French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur made a surprise visit to French UN

the French last week lost one of their men to Serb Shooting.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Slovaks worry about jobs as political battle rages: The
crisis as Meciar fights for survival after losing a parliamentary vote of
no-confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Vladimir Meciar, Slovakia's beleaguered prime minister, begins what is
expected to be a long and bitter battle for his political survival today,
when he hands in his government's resignation.
Mr Meciar, who lost a parliamentary vote of no-confidence on Friday, has
already threatened to close down government by immediately pulling out all
his ministers.
While in theory a new government could be appointed within days, as is
clearly the hope of President Michal Kovac, disagreements within the
opposition and stalling tactics by Mr Meciar and his Movement for a
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) could prolong the crisis.
Parliament must also approve a date for early elections - something it has
not been able to agree on until now. The next general election is not due
before 1996.
Mr Meciar - who is aware of conflicting interests within the opposition,
which ranges from the strongly christian KDH on the right to the reformed
communists in the Party of the Democratic Left (SDL) - has also thrown the
cat among the pigeons by pushing for a general election in June.
This was rejected by parliament as impractical, but the opposition then
failed to muster enough support for its own motion calling for elections in
November. Deputies representing the Hungarian ethnic minority held back
support in the hope of winning concessions for more autonomy.
The SDL will now try again on Wednesday with another motion calling for
elections in September-October, but it is by no means guaranteed it will win
the 90 votes required in the 150-seat parliament. The opposition could
muster only 78 votes in support of its no-confidence motion.
The HZDS has also gathered more than the 350,000 signatures required for a
petition to force a referendum on holding early elections and dismissing
deputies who have switched party. If the petition is accepted as legitimate,
President Kovac must order a referendum within 30 days, but even so
elections are likely to be delayed.
'It could take months before the situation is resolved,' a senior Slovak
official said privately yesterday.
Such political uncertainty could not come at a worse time, with the country
facing serious economic difficulties that may require unpopular measures.
The economy remains deeply in recession, unemployment already at 15 per cent
of the workforce is rising fast, and there may be renewed pressures for a
devaluation.
None of this would make a transitional government very popular.
The problem is compounded by the lack of clear political alternatives.
Opposition to Mr Meciar has been as much over his authoritarian style of
governing as about policies. None of the opposition parties has come up with
a distinct political progamme for government, focusing instead on piecemeal
policies.
Slovakia became independent almost against its own wishes on January 1993,
having to build most of its institutions from scratch.
It was short of qualified personnel, and its politicians had no experience
of running an independent country.
This has made for highly personalised and unpredictable politics, such as
attempts to find a third way between capitalism and socialism, that have
since been abandoned but did not help the country's international image or
encourage foreign investment.
Meanwhile, the past two years' political infighting has alienated an
increasing number of Slovaks. According to recent polls, about half eligible
voters do not intend to vote or do not know what to vote for. Younger voters
are most disaffected, though dissatisfaction is widespread.
'They don't care, they're just interested in power,' says a young biology
student in Bratislava. A taxi driver berates the politicians' constant
wheeling and dealing and has no time for the parliament. 'It's bad for
business,' he says.
Even officials are down-hearted. 'There's a big gap between what the
government thinks and what the people think,' a provincial chief of police
says.
Less than two years after victory in the June 1992 elections, and over a
year after independence, Mr Meciar's popularity has declined to around 15
per cent in opinion polls. The government has been weakened by successive
rows and defections, culminating in the recent damaging public confrontation
with the president.
Independence has not brought the prosperity promised by politicians, though
it is now accepted as irreversible. People are more worried about jobs and
security, but with every new twist in the political crisis, the uncertainty
deepens and prospects of economic recovery become more remote.
'Whatever happens it's going to take time. It's a mess, and its going to get
worse before it gets better,' one diplomat said.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Envoys near critical stage in hunt for Bosnian peace: US and
Russia anxious to begin drawing up maps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US and Russia, now co-ordinating every move in the search for peace in
the former Yugoslavia, want to resolve one of the more intractable aspects
of a settlement for Bosnia: the maps.
After three days of negotiations in Vienna, Zagreb and Sarajevo, Mr Charles
Redman, the US special envoy, and Mr Vitaly Churkin, his Russian
counterpart, are reaching a critical stage in negotiations over Bosnia's
future.
US and UN officials said that if the Bosnian Serbs could not be brought on
board to join the complex federation of Bosnia's Moslems and Croats - the
draft constitution of which was agreed by the two former adversaries in
Vienna yesterday - then the Bosnian Serbs would have to decide whether to
cede land in return for peace.
Otherwise, they added, the Bosnian Serbs could find themselves in a 'limbo',
with their territory The search for a settlement intensified over the
weekend when:
General John Galvin, the former supreme commander of Nato, helped forge a
defence agreement between Bosnia's Croats and Moslems leading to the
establishment of one Bosnian army. US officials stressed this would not
provide the means for a new offensive against the Bosnian Serbs. 'Its aim is
to stop the fighting between Croats and Moslems. It is also the first step
towards creation of a federation in one part of Bosnia,' a US official said.
After talks in Zagreb, the Croatian capital, Mr Churkin said he would not
rule out Serb participation in the federation. Even Mr Momcilo Krajisnik,
speaker of the Bosnian Serbs' self-proclaimed parliament and an important
negotiator, said Serbs were willing to join peace talks or some some kind of
co-existence with Moslems and Croats within Bosnia.
In Sarajevo, Bosnian Serb and Moslems said they had set up a preliminary
agreement to open up to civilian traffic routes in and out of the Bosnian
capital. This could be the beginning of the lifting of the siege, and an
eventual demilitarisation of the city.
Mr Churkin, who met Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic in Sarajevo
yesterday, will today hold talks with Serb leaders in Belgrade, the Serbian
capital. US officials said the talks could pave the way for an overall peace
settlement for Bosnia and Croatia.
Mr Churkin must establish today whether President Slobodan Milosevic of
Serbia is ready to sue for peace, which would lead to the lifting of
sanctions.
Any moves towards peace would require Belgrade persuading the Bosnian Serbs,
who hold nearly 70 per cent of Bosnia, to reduce their control to about 49
per cent.
During the Bosnian Croat and Moslem talks hosted by the US in Vienna, maps
have not been discussed for the federation as any decisions would have to
involve negotiations with the Bosnian Serbs.
Sections of the Bosnian Serb leadership are loath to cede any land. It would
mean breaking the fragile territorial corridors linking Serbs living in
Krajina, south-western Croatia, to Bosnian Serb territory, and ultimately to
Serbia proper.
'It is difficult to know if the links between Milosevic and the Krajina
Serbs are weaker than those between the Bosnian Serbs and Krajina,' a UN
negotiator said.
'Milosevic has to decide if he is prepared to weaken those links (with
Krajina) in return for sanctions being lifted; equally the Bosnian Serbs
must recognise they have no legitimacy as a self-proclaimed state if they do
not negotiate,' he added.
But the overriding consideration with regard to the status - and fate - of
the Krajina Serbs is the extent to which they can be used as pawns by
Belgrade in the hunt for a settlement with Croatia and Bosnia.
'The future status Krajina holds is the linchpin for peace between Croatia
and Serbia,' a UN peace negotiator said. 'Croatia wants full control of its
territory, including Krajina. But the Krajina Serbs do not want to live in
Croatia, regardless of pressure from Belgrade. They are the Achilles' heel.'
Despite this, Bosnian Serbs - and Mr Milosevic - continue to hold a strong
negotiating position. They can argue that the federation of Bosnian Croats
and Moslems will be linked to Croatia through a confederation, in effect
creating an eventual Greater Croatia and rewarding Croat gains in western
Hercegovina. Consequently they can ask why the Bosnian Serbs in eastern
Bosnian cannot link to Serbia proper.
'The answer is that the US wants to maintain a semblance of Bosnia's
territorial integrity. But we know that under a new guise, and with haggling
over the maps, Bosnia is already being carved up between Zagreb and
Belgrade,' a UN official said.

<TEXT>
French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur paid an unannounced visit to French
troops serving with United Nations peacekeepers in former Yugoslavia
yesterday, Reuter reports from Paris.
Mr Balladur went first to Zagreb, Croatia, and was due to visit the Bihac
pocket in northern Bosnia, aides said.
He was accompanied by Defence Minister Francois Leotard on his visit to
units which came under Serb fire last week, when artillery rounds hit French
positions and a 22-year-old soldier was killed by a sniper.
French commanders are reported to be irate since a request they made for
Nato aircraft to strike back at the Serbs was turned down by UN commanders.
The Bihac pocket, where about 1,300 French troops are stationed, is a
Moslem-inhabited enclave surrounded by Serb troops.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Focus on the centre ground: Italian general elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Italy's general election enters its final two weeks, attention has
switched to the large, undecided vote caused by the collapse of the
traditional centrist grouping.
Polls published last week showed that neither of the two main alliances on
the right and left were capable of winning an absolute parliamentary
majority. This raises the spectre of the centre, composed of the reshuffled
remnants of the five parties that have governed post-war Italy, acting as
arbiters in the formation of the next government.
The polls, the last permitted before the election on March 27, also
suggested that the momentum had slowed behind media magnate Silvio
Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement.
Mr Berlusconi himself suffered embarrassment over the weekend after his
younger brother Paolo admitted he had paid L1.3bn (Pounds 520,000) to
Socialist and Communist local councillors to secure a golf club development
at Basiglio near Milan. In connection with these payments, Milan magistrates
searched the home of Mr Alessandro Moneta, a former mayor of Basiglio and
currently southern Italy co-ordinator for Forza Italia.
According to a poll conducted by Directa, the Berlusconi-dominated
right-wing alliance would obtain 295 seats in the 630 lower house against
242 seats for the Progressive Alliance led by the former communist Party of
the Democratic Left (PDS).
The Directa poll - broadly endorsed by another conducted by Telemontecarlo -
indicated that the PDS will get a maximum of 135 seats in the chamber of
deputies with Reconstructed Communism, the hardline rump of the old
Communist party, winning up to 35 seats. The strength of Reconstructed
Communism and its damaging programme proposals, such as raising taxes on
government bonds, are imposing severe strains on the Progressive Alliance.
The centre parties, composed mainly of the former Christian Democrats
reformed under the Popular party (PPI) and referendum leader Mr Mario
Segni's Pact for Italy, would get 68. The remaining seats would go to the
small parties.
Seven former members of Italy's domestic intelligence service (Sisde) have
been sent for trial for allegedly embezzling L60bn following an
investigation by Rome magistrates lasting over nine months.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Brittan's book stirs debate on expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government faces renewed controversy over Europe today after the
premature release of a book by Sir Leon Brittan, in which the senior British
commissioner calls for a wide-ranging overhaul of decision-making in an
expanded European Union.
Sir Leon's views run counter to the UK's insistence on special protection
for the large member states which has led to deadlock in enlargement talks
with Sweden, Finland, Austria and Norway.
His proposals for institutional reform are also likely to stir up Tory
Euro-sceptics worried that UK Prime Minister John Major's government may be
about drop its hard-line stand and adopt a more pro-European manifesto ahead
of European Parliament elections in June.
Mr Major was warned yesterday that any retreat from his insistence on
maintaining the present voting system after enlargement would provoke new
convulsions within the Conservative party. But with other EU states
threatening to block enlargement unless the threshold for a blocking
minority within the council was raised from the present 23 votes, British
ministers acknowledged the dilemma.
Both Mr Major and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, have been adamant
that the minority veto should not be diluted. The same point has been made
to Conservative party managers by Euro-sceptic MPs.
EU foreign ministers will attempt to rescue the enlargement talks at a
meeting tomorrow in Brussels. Spanish demands for access to 7,000 tonnes of
Norwegian cod appear likely to be accommodated after reports of a new offer
from Oslo; but hopes of settling the row over power-sharing rest on a
face-saving compromise which takes greater account of population.
Britain, supported by Spain, is pressing to maintain the present voting
arrangements which allow two large nations and a smaller country to block
their partners. Germany and other EU members want to raise the 'blocking
minority' threshold to 27 votes. One compromise under review is to increase
the blocking minority to 27 votes, on condition it would not apply if
countries representing more than 40 per cent of the population wanted to
hold up decisions.
Mr Javier Solana, Spanish foreign minister, said in an interview with the El
Pais newspaper yesterday: 'I hope in the coming days we can find a formula
that will satisfy our legitimate aspirations.'
Friends of Sir Leon said last week that he was dismayed at the UK
government's apparent willingness to jeopardise enlargement, a goal
previously judged to be central to Britain's European policy.
The chief EU trade negotiator, who is a candidate to succeed Mr Jacques
Delors as president of the European Commission, argues in his book that
institutional reform is inevitable. He urges the UK to prepare actively for
the entry of the former communist countries of central and eastern Europe in
the Union.
In his book, Sir Leon proposes the introduction of a three-tier voting
system which would balance the need for accelerated decision-making without
upsetting the balance between the big and smaller member states.
The first tier would cover internal market measures, health and safety at
work, farm and fisheries policies, as well as the purchase and sale of goods
and services anywhere in the EU. These measures would be subject to 'low
majority' voting, making it harder for countries to muster a blocking
minority.
A second tier would cover social rules and the environment, as well as
'exceptional trade measures' such as action against low-cost imports. This
would make a majority in favour of action harder to achieve, though still
not impossible for a single country to block.
A third tier would cover the levying of taxes, all moves to European
economic and monetary union, increasing the EU's budget, and all laws on
visas and immigration. On these matters of 'core sovereignty', governments
would retain their right to veto.
Sir Leon's book is part of his undeclared campaign to succeed Mr Delors. It
is already on sale at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, although it was
not due to appear until the end of the month.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Opponents or critics of the European Union made gains in three elections to
provincial parliaments in Austria yesterday, according to results in
Carinthia, Salzburg and Tyrol.
The far-right Freedom party (FPO), led by Mr Jorg Haider, who waged a
strongly nationalist campaign, and the Greens, who oppose EU membership,
increased their share of the vote.
The two government coalition parties which strongly favour EU membership
lost support, with the conservative People's party (OVP) losing votes in
Salzburg and Tyrol, and the Social Democratic party (SPO) vote declining in
all three provinces.
The FPO vote in Carinthia rose from its record 29 per cent in 1989 to 33.3
per cent. But this will not be enough for Mr Haider to recapture the
province's governorship which he had to give up three years ago after making
remarks praising Nazi Germany's employment policies.
Since then the province has had a conservative governor backed by the OVP
and the SPO. The Social Democrats, however, saw their vote in the province
fall from 46 per cent in 1989 to 37.4 per cent. The maverick Mr Haider has
been ambivalent about the EU.
The Greens did particularly well in Tyrol, winning 10.6 per cent of the vote
and representation in the provincial assembly.
They campaigned strongly against the government's deal with the EU on
transit lorries.
The pro-EU Liberal Forum, scored less than 4 per cent of the vote. Austria
must hold a referendum on EU membership in June.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Rome agrees retirement deal for workers in Ilva
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian government has agreed to fund an early retirement programme for
10,450 people working in Ilva, the state-controlled steel group ordered by
the EU to cut production.
According to trades union representatives the deal, finalised on Saturday,
will cost up to L1,800bn (Pounds 720m) over the next three years.
This is the second time in a fortnight that the government has brokered
costly early retirement packages to solve problems of industrial
restructuring. The previous agreement concerned 6,600 workers in Fiat's
automotive sector. Both have been pushed through in advance of the March 27
general elections.
'It is a costly but effective arrangement,' said Mr Luigi Portioli, a union
official. 'The cost to the public purse will be four times that of Fiat, and
at least L1,800bn will be needed over the next three years to cover all the
early retirements envisaged.'
Ilva, controlled by Iri, the state holding company, undertook last December,
as part of a EU-wide plan to slim steel capacity, to cut production by 1.2m
tonnes a year. The cuts affected 12,517 of its total workforce of 45,000,
the bulk coming from the Taranto steelworks, Europe's largest steel complex.
Under the weekend agreement, early retirement covers most job losses at
Taranto as well as at Ilva's Bagnoli plant, closed 18 months ago.
The deal limits job losses through solidarity contracts - work-sharing
arrangements on reduced pay and hours. Some 1,200 jobs are being saved
through 4,300 solidarity contracts. A further 1,500 will be transferred to
other companies within the group and 1,000 workers will be employed in
community work projects.
With the job aspect of Ilva's restructuring settled, the group's
privatisation will be accelerated. It is being split into two - flat
products and special steels - while a third company will preside over Ilva's
liquidation.
Last week the second phase of bidding for the two new steel companies
closed. Two groups are said to be interested in the flat products division
based around Taranto: a consortium of local Taranto interests, Falck the
Italian steel producer, and foreign investors; and a group led by Italy's
Lucchini steel group, reported to be backed by France's Usinor Sacilor.

FT  14 MAR 94 / EU procurement row with US set to flare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission is heading for a showdown with the US over public
procurement after the disclosure that the US has, in the view of Commission
officials, revived efforts to woo Germany away from its European partners.
Last week the Clinton administration quietly dropped trade sanctions against
Germany, apparently implementing the secret non-aggression pact which it
struck with the Bonn government on telecommunications a year ago. Commission
officials said yesterday that the US action appeared aimed at driving a
wedge between Germany and the rest of the European Union.
The US move could trigger Commission measures against Germany if the Bonn
government was shown to have failed to implement EU trade sanctions against
the US. These were imposed last year as part of the long-running
transatlantic dispute over public procurement.
The US action was disclosed in the daily Federal Register of US government
business last Thursday, and comes ahead of a renewed effort by the
Commission and the Clinton administration to resolve outstanding differences
on opening public procurement markets.
The two sides have set a deadline of April 15, when leaders are due to
assemble in Marrakesh to sign the Uruguay Round agreement of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Arguments over fair access to lucrative contracts in road, rail and other
public sector projects flared in the early days of the Clinton
administration. But the row was defused with reciprocal market-opening
measures, supported by token trade sanctions and the promise of an
independent study into trade barriers. Later, however, Mr Mickey Kantor, US
trade representative, reached a separate bilateral understanding with Mr
Gunter Rexrodt, German economics minister. Under the oral deal, Mr Rexrodt
indicated that Germany would not apply Article 29 of the EU's utilities
directive which gives a 3 per cent price preference to EU companies, and
allows a bidder to ignore an offer if it has less than 50 per cent local
content.
The German offer challenged the EU decision to impose a Dollars 15m (Pounds
10.2m) sanctions package against the US. It also appeared to contravene the
Treaty of Rome, which awards sole competence to the European Commission on
trade policy.
A spokesman for Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, said the
Commission had not initiated infringement proceedings against Germany. If
Bonn was not applying the relevant public procurement legislation that would
be 'surprising and disappointing', he said.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Clinton wants talks with Scharping
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US administration is trying to arrange an early meeting in Washington
between President Bill Clinton and Mr Rudolf Scharping, the German Social
Democratic party leader.
The US approach is being undertaken with the full approval of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, according to officials in Washington. He is said to accept that
it is perfectly normal for the US president to meet leaders of the
opposition in countries close to the US.
The heavy German election season, beginning yesterday in Lower Saxony and
culminating at the national level in October, presents the US with a tricky
problem of diplomatic niceties.
Mr Clinton and Mr Kohl get on well, as witnessed in their genial last
session in Washington in January. In July the president will go to Germany
after the summit in Naples of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations.
Beyond personal rapport, US-German co-operation over issues such as Bosnia
and Russia has become extremely close, partly because of the effectiveness
of Mr Richard Holbrooke, the US ambassador in Bonn. In general terms, the
Clinton administration is giving as high a priority to Germany in the
European context as did its predecessor.
On the other hand, the US can read German public opinion polls as well as
the next country and is aware that Mr Scharping, whom Mr Clinton has never
met, could be the next chancellor.
Mr Scharping also appears a politician in the Clinton image. US officials
are particularly struck by his tough fiscal and budgetary policy proposals,
which they see as similar to the deficit reduction plan now in effect in the
US.
The SDP leader has had some recent contact with US officials. He met Mr
William Perry, now defence secretary, at a conference in Germany some two
months ago.
Mr Clinton will want to avoid the uncomfortable precedent set, in reverse,
in the 1976 US election, when then Chancellor Helmut Schmidt's public
preference for President Gerald Ford created problems for the bilateral
relationship when Mr Jimmy Carter became president.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Inflation 'to fall' in west Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Inflation in western Germany is set to fall below 2 per cent, according to
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president.
'Expectations of stability will now be visibly fulfilled and confirmed
through the continuing decline in the rate of price increases,' he told
Dusseldorf foreign exchange dealers at the weekend.
His confident statement, which follows anti-inflationary pay settlements
last week in the engineering and public service sectors, will give support
to the strengthening view among economists that the bank's 5.25 per cent
discount lending rate could fall to 4 per cent or less by the year's end.
'With a February rate of 3.4 per cent we have still not reached where we
ought to be: below 2 per cent. But we are on the way,' Mr Tietmeyer said.
Economists expect the 2 per cent barrier to be breached early next year.
German inflation has fallen below 2 per cent in only two periods in the past
35 years, in the late 1960s, and again between 1986 and 1988.
Mr Tietmeyer shrugged off recent surges in world capital market interest
rates. The development stemmed from the US and Japan. 'It was neither a
typically German nor European phenomenon, and certainly not a result of
developments in our M3,' he said.
M3, the bank's favoured measure of money supply growth and potential
inflation, ballooned in January with an annualised expansion rate of over 20
per cent. International markets, already rattled by fears of rising US
inflation, took fright when the figure was released earlier this month.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Portugal seeks compromise on power-sharing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Anbal Cavaco Silva, the Portuguese prime minister, has held out the
possibility of a compromise this week to settle the power-sharing row which
could prevent Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway joining the European
Union.
In an interview during a visit to London, Mr Cavaco Silva also urged Britain
to rejoin the exchange rate mechanism of the European monetary system it
left in September 1992.
He said he told Mr John Major, the British prime minister, in talks on
Friday that the UK should rejoin the ERM 'to persuade others to move in the
right direction' in progress towards economic and monetary union.
On the EU votes dispute, which pits Britain against most of its EU partners,
Mr Cavaco Silva said he hoped Brussels talks starting tomorrow would agree a
formula under which a minority of states could veto EU decisions in a
16-nation EU.
Most EU members want to raise the so-called 'blocking minority,' the
threshold for blocking decisions in the EU council of ministers, to 27 votes
from 23 at present. Britain and Spain, with some support from Italy, are
insisting on keeping the 23-vote blocking minority unchanged to avoid being
more easily outvoted in the enlarged EU.
Unless resolved, the row could scupper plans for the four members of the
European Free Trade Association (Efta) to join the EU next year.
Mr Cavaco Silva said a deal could set a combination of votes and numbers of
states able to block EU decisions. Since the UK government was 'keen' on
enlarging the EU, he did not think the UK would want the voting disagreement
to hold up accession by the four Efta states.
Mr Cavaco Silva said he agreed on Friday with Mr Major that enlargement
towards the Efta states should be agreed without opening a debate on
fundamental reform of EU decision making, which looks like topping the
agenda of the conference planned for 1996 to review progress of the
Maastricht treaty. 'It would be a mistake to open the institutional question
now,' he said. 'This would not stabilise confidence.'

FT  14 MAR 94 / Kohl's party loses support in state election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN and QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's opposition Social Democratic party (SPD) coasted to a clear
victory in the state election in Lower Saxony last night, with Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union slipping to its worst result in the
state since 1959.
As the first of 19 separate elections this year - 16 state and local
authority elections, an electoral assembly for federal president in May,
European elections in June, and finally the general election on October 16 -
the Lower Saxony vote is seen as a key indicator. It confirms the long
uphill struggle Mr Kohl faces if he is to win re-election, even if the SPD
has yet to gain a decisive lead at a national level.
Mr Gerhard Schroder, the SPD premier, won 44.3 per cent of the vote. That
translates into a one-seat majority in the Hanover-based state parliament.
Mr Schroder said he would rule without his former coalition partner, the
Green party.
'It is a great result saddled with a great responsibility,' he said. Without
the Greens 'we can create (policies) more quickly and effectively'.
The CDU fell by almost 6 points from their 1990 showing, scoring 36.4 per
cent. However, the biggest loser of the evening was the Free Democratic
party, Chancellor Kohl's partner in the Bonn coalition, which slumped from 6
per cent last time to 4.4 per cent, failing to make the 5 per cent threshold
needed to ensure seats in the state parliament.
Mr Jurgen Trittin, the leading Green party minister in the outgoing
SPD-Green coalition in Hanover, said: 'This is the day the 'twilight of the
chancellor' began in Bonn.'
Yet the result amounts to less of a setback for Mr Kohl than had been feared
by some party members, and less of a victory for the Social Democrats, who
improved only fractionally on their vote from 1990 in spite of the Bonn
government's obvious unpopularity.
The CDU did far worse in both the previous local elections - in Hamburg last
September, when its vote fell to 25 per cent, and in Brandenburg in
December, when it barely won 20 per cent and fell to third place behind the
Democratic Socialist Party (PDS), the former Communists.
Despite strong winds and heavy rain until two hours before polls closed,
73.8 per cent of voters turned out, slightly less than in 1990, but good
news for the two main parties who feared they would be the first victims of
voter apathy.
The result showed that the rise of protest parties has not happened to the
extent predicted by some political observers.
The Green party won 7.4 per cent of the vote, up from 5.5 per cent in 1990;
the right-wing Republicans secured 3.7 per cent, up from 1.5 per cent; while
the Statt Partei, which won more than 6 per cent in Hamburg last year, took
1.3 per cent.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Electricity pool price falls in chase for market share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prices in the electricity pool, the wholesale market for power in England
and Wales, have hit record lows as National Power and PowerGen, the two
largest generators, engage in a fierce battle for market share.
The price falls are an unexpected bonus for several thousand industrial
users of electricity. These include Imperial Chemical Industries, whose
power bills are related directly to pool prices and which has long
complained about increases.
Domestic consumers, whose power supplies are protected by long-term hedging
contracts, will not benefit unless prices stay at such low levels for some
months, which is unlikely.
In the pool system generators offer the National Grid a series of prices for
electricity from each of their power stations. The National Grid then
chooses which plants will supply electricity the next day. Electricity from
the pool is bought by large energy users, and regional electricity companies
which distribute it to the public.
The biggest loser from the price fall is Nuclear Electric which earns more
of its income through selling to the pool than the two largest generators,
and is less protected by hedging against unexpected price fluctuations.
Ironically, the record low prices come at the end of a financial year in
which Professor Stephen Littlechild, industry regulator, threatened to refer
National Power and PowerGen to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission after
earlier price rises.
Last month he decided against a referral after the generators agreed to keep
the pool price below 2.4p/Kwh on average over the next two years.
This suggests that the main component of prices, the so-called system
marginal price, should be 2.1p at most. The SMP is the bid price of
electricity from the most expensive power station needed to meet all
demands.
Last weekend, March 5 and 6, SMP was 1.1p, the lowest daily average since
the pool was set up in March 1990. The average for all days this month
including yesterday was 1.5p, compared with a peak of 2.6p last May and 2.1p
in February. If the March trend were to continue the SMP would be the lowest
for any month since December 1990 when the first power companies were
privatised. The previous lowest was 1.8p in August 1991.
Market analysts were hesitant to draw conclusions on long-term pool prices.
Most believe prices will rise at the start of the new financial year next
month.
They point out that prices often change at this time of year as companies
seek to ensure that profits and market shares are in line with their
expectations, although this year's fall is exceptional. Both National Power
and PowerGen have seen their market shares cut as Nuclear Electric's plants
have improved their performance and new generating companies have come on
stream. Both companies also have policies of reducing coal stocks, which
analysts believe has contributed to the price fall.

FT  14 MAR 94 / PM urged to shelve radical plans: Privatisation of Post
Office and other proposed legislation may be delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A powerful group of cabinet ministers is pressing Mr John Major to shelve
plans for further radical legislation and concentrate instead on rebuilding
a reputation for competent government in the run-up to the next general
election.
The move looks set to delay indefinitely privatisation of the Post Office.
Many other other controversial reforms covering deregulation, privatisation
and local government reorganisation may also be deferred or dropped.
Mr Major is being told by the so-called consolidators in his cabinet to
eschew Thatcherite radicalism in favour of entrenching past shake-ups of
education, health and other public services.
The ministers believe that with the government already committed to
difficult legislation next year on social security benefits, pensions and
Europe, it cannot afford to take unnecessary risks.
The view runs counter to the instincts of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor,
who wants the government to maintain the momentum of change. Mr Clarke is
backed by the handful of rightwing ministers in the cabinet.
The division promises a protracted struggle over the next few months as the
cabinet frames the legislative programme for the autumn parliamentary
session.
But after a series of unexpected political rows, defeats in the House of
Lords and embarrassing u-turns during the past few months there is a strong
mood in favour of retrenchment on the Tory back benches.
The consolidators' group, which includes Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary, Lord Wakeham, the leader of the House of Lords, and Mr Richard
Ryder, the chief whip, see as their first target the proposed break-up of
the Post Office.
Several have warned that privatisation of the Royal Mail would invite strong
opposition both in the Lords and among Tory MPs because of the potentially
damaging implications for rural services and post offices.
They are supported by several other ministers including Mr Tony Newton,
leader of the House of Commons, Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, and Mr
William Waldegrave, public services minister.
The consolidators are also resisting Treasury calls for an 'omnibus'
privatisation bill. The Treasury wants to streamline the privatisation
procedure by removing the need for separate 'paving' legislation before each
sale of public assets. But opponents say it would run into certain trouble
in the Lords.
There is also growing pressure from the consolidators for the government to
delay implementation of the recommendations of its Local Government
Commission which is redrawing the boundaries of English local authorities.
The Commission is due to complete its work at the end of this year, but some
ministers want implementation to be put back until after the next general
election.
Other measures facing possible delay are the proposed new privacy
legislation, London taxi and bus deregulation, liberalisation of the
licensing laws and alignment of British Summer Time with continental Europe.
Treasury hopes that the nuclear industry might be privatised in the present
parliament are also being dismissed as unrealistic.
The government is committed by last year's Budget to several controversial
measures. These include bills to curb unemployment and invalidity benefit
and to raise the pension age for women to 65. It will also have to introduce
another European bill to allow for enlargement of the Union and a health
service bill to pave the way for the abolition of regional authorities.

FT  14 MAR 94 / Ministers may use army for airport security
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL and DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ministers are this week expected to consider using army patrols to boost
security at British airports after a third IRA mortar attack at Heathrow in
five days and further threats to London's two big airports.
Heathrow and Gatwick airports were both closed for several hours last night
after coded warnings, and many flights were diverted. Scotland Yard later
described the warnings as a 'cynical ploy by the IRA to cause unnecessary
confusion and fear amongst the public'.
The scare came as the IRA demanded new direct talks between republicans and
the government. In a statement released in Dublin, the IRA said there had to
be talks if there was any chance of an end to violence. It was prepared to
be flexible and positive in exploring potential for moving the peace process
forward, but lines of communication would have to reopen.
The IRA has yet to make a definitive response to the Downing Street
declaration reached between Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime
minister, three months ago, but this is as close as it has come to
acknowledging that the agreement is not enough to stop its campaign.
Meanwhile, army personnel and equipment helped search Heathrow for further
devices following yesterday's attack in which four mortars, fired from a
heavily camouflaged launcher, failed to explode.
One hit the roof of Terminal 4, which was closed for eight hours, causing
delays to flights. The police believe the launchers involved in the three
attacks were placed at the same time. The launchers involved in the two
lastest attacks had timers attached to them.
The IRA's ability to embarrass the security forces and disrupt travel will
today bring renewed calls at Westminster for tighter security.
The government, however, will be anxious to prevent the IRA using the
introduction of army patrols as a propaganda coup. It is also aware that
tighter security measures in one location may only switch IRA attacks
elsewhere.
Ministers could meet as early as today to decide whether to approve a
high-profile army presence at airports. Downing Street said any requests
from the police for the army's help would be carefully considered.
Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, last night accused Sinn Fein and the
IRA of showing 'utter contempt' for the peace process. He believed the
mortar attacks had turned Sinn Fein's internal discussions on the peace
process into a 'bizarre charade' and said people viewed with growing dismay
the prospects for an early end to violence.
Last night the IRA claimed its warnings were deliberately ignored. 'The luck
of the British authorities who are deliberately taking these calculated and
cynical gambles with peoples' lives will inevitably run out,' it said.
London hotels fear the attacks will lead to cancellations by businessmen and
tourists this summer - particularly US visitors. But US business people
leaving New York for London yesterday thought it would have little immediate
effect.
The IRA action is also likely to bring Dublin under more pressure from
British ministers to improve cross-border co-operation in combating
terrorism - an issue already high on the Anglo-Irish agenda.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain will pay the Dollars 29.5m (Pounds 20.2m) damages to settle a
dispute over fees charged to US airlines landing at London's Heathrow
airport, the Department of Transportation in Washington announced last
night.
The department said the agreement settled a long dispute over fees at the
airport between 1983 and 1989. It said Britain had agreed to change the
charging system at Heathrow to make it fairer to US carriers.
The settlement was reached after an international arbitration panel ruled
that Britain had failed to use its best efforts to ensure that charges at
Heathrow were just and reasonable. It concludes years of negotiations and
litigation.
Britain also agreed to drop claims it had filed against the US over charges
at US airports. The US agreed to encourage its airports to consult with
airline users in setting their fees.

The fashion collection which has inspired such a sanctimonious brouhaha in
the British press (and earned nothing but praise elsewhere) was dedicated by
Vivienne Westwood to John Stuart Mill's essay, On Liberty.
Since this is the great liberal-utilitarian argument for free speech,
Westwood cannot object to all that wordy outrage; she is just, as ever, a
little disappointed at being so wilfully misunderstood.
At the nub of the dispute is the question: what are Paris catwalk shows for?
Certain mature British fashion journalists believe they are to show nice
outfits that they personally can buy and wear next season. Some designers
agree. Other designers, however, think of the runway show both as spectacle
and as a forum for ideas.
Ideas? Isn't that, you might well mutter, a little pretentious? We're
talking frocks here. But the truth about Vivienne Westwood and the
homosexual male designers indicted for misogyny last week is that their
medium is not only bits of cloth; it is woman's identity, particularly her
sexual identity. And it is inevitable that, just as in an art gallery or a
theatre, the more exploratory and experimental the designer's ideas, the
more they will shock us, amuse us, make us think a little.
The fashion designer's vocabulary is composed of the many images of
femaleness which women have worn through the centuries of human
civilisation. As with a living language, new words must be coined to
describe new concepts but their roots will be in words which already exist.
Twenty-five years after the start of the second phase of women's
mobilisation for equality, we are still seeking new definitions of
femininity. Arguably, this is an endless search.
Any new definition must come partly out of the old. Predominant are those
essentially male fantasies which we now categorise as pornographic but in
whose creation (and Westwood for one is quite clear on this) women colluded.
They are female identities modern woman needs to confront and explore.
On the runways of Paris and of London, Milan and New York designers, male
and female, homo- and heterosexual, use the vocabulary at their disposal to
do that. Westwood just does it more self-consciously and with more humour,
playing with archetypes and goading us to deconstruct them. Breasts have had
a lot of her attention. She has explored their erotic potential from maximum
artificiality to complete naturalness. And so, on her heels, have the other
designers. Indeed, nowadays a nipple or a thousand nipples pass unnoticed on
the catwalks.
Nevertheless, on the morning after her show, Westwood was once again called
upon to deny that she really expected women to bare their nipples on the
Tube or to employ a bustle to quell the competition for the last seat.
Aware of the history, and aware that, while the bustle was being lampooned
in the press, Mill's essay was being debated in the drawing rooms of Europe
and the Americas, Westwood set out to make connections and to amuse.
Mill, of course, also wrote On the Subjection of Women, the tract which
inspired the suffragettes. He was more concerned with lack of property
rights and domestic slavery than with corsets, but fashion historians and
feminist theorists have taken the corset and the crinoline as symbols for
woman, the non-citizen, the non-person.
It was Westwood who deconstructed that concept, perhaps not totally
satisfactorily but, at least, illuminatingly. Mill may be her hero but
Westwood says she's no feminist. That does not deter feminist semioticians
from admiring her. They, she may be mortified to know, do understand her.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Private View: More Big Bang for our bucks - Christian Tyler
meets the man responsible for Europe's planned proton-smasher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What is it worth to you if they discover the Higgs boson? It is not an idle
question, for this summer ministers and their advisers from 19 European
countries are likely to tell the scientists of Cern, the particle physics
laboratory outside Geneva, that they can have Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) of
taxpayers' money to build a big proton-smasher inside their 27km circular
tunnel.
Few of us taxpayers will get a chance to say what we think about this latest
stage in the hunt for particles that might illuminate the dawn of time. So,
calculating my own contribution at about Pounds 1 a year - say a fiver for
the family - I flew to Geneva to ask the head boson-hunter what the payback
was.
Professor Christopher Llewellyn Smith is a 51-year-old theoretical physicist
and cross-country Blue from Oxford who became director general of Cern in
January. He has a rapid, precise manner - not without humour - and the
faintly mid-Atlantic speech of the globe-trotting academic. He did not try
to blind me with science, choke me with muons, gluons and quarks of colour,
charm and spin, nor dazzle me with the infinitely large and infinitesimally
small quantities his profession trades in.
So, endeavouring to look my most alert, I asked: What will the Higgs boson
do for the taxpayer?
'It is one very, very major step in understanding the way the universe is
put together,' he replied. 'If you ask why anyone should be interested, I
think there are three parts to the answer.
'First, the subject is justified as the pursuit of pure knowledge. I mean,
it's part of our culture.' He quoted a remark of the first director of
Fermilab who, asked by a US congressional committee what the lab contributed
to the defence of the nation, replied: 'Nothing. But it makes it worth
defending.'
'It's part of mankind's history to be curious about how things work,' the
professor added. 'We're trying to find out at the deepest level what matter
is made of, why the universe is the way it is and not some other way.'
His second argument was, not surprisingly, about direct and indirect
spin-off. But he did not labour it. The discovery of new fundamental laws of
physics usually had important practical applications, such as the discovery
of the electron. However, that was getting harder to be sure of, the further
physics moved away from everyday experience. 'So I don't think you can
justify the expenditure on those grounds.'
Technical development was another kind of spin-off. For example, the
collision detectors pioneered by Georges Charpak of Cern (and for which he
won a Nobel prize in 1992) were used for medical imaging; accelerators were
employed for cancer therapy.
'That's not the reason you do it, but it gives some return and you should
subtract it from the price. I always say it's a bit like subsidising the
theatre in London: it brings in tourists, but that's not the reason you
subsidise theatre.'
His third justification was education. Flagship projects attracted
schoolchildren to science, even if they ended up in engineering rather than
cosmology, while graduate students acquired valuable, if expensive, training
at Cern.
But, I said, the search for knowledge is the real reason?
'It is the real reason, I absolutely agree with that.'
For some people the scale of the endeavour alone may be sufficient
justification for spending the money. The Large Hadron Collider will be
inserted into the biggest of Cern's tunnels, a racetrack several miles
longer than the Circle Line of the London Underground. Where it takes a man
six hours to walk round, the protons will whip round the circuit 11,000
times a second. Their path is so precisely aligned that even the daily
gravitational pull of the moon has to be adjusted for. To get them to fly in
a circular path requires six tonnes of magnetic force every metre. The
debris of the collisions - including perhaps the Higgs boson - will be
detected by machines three storeys high, in a microcosm of what was going on
a fraction of a billionth of a second after the Big Bang which began the
universe.
The Higgs particle was postulated years ago by Prof Peter Higgs of Edinburgh
University to explain why some particles are massive, some massless.
Llewellyn Smith said it would help us understand why some forces of nature
operate over vast distances, others over minute distances, and why matter is
clumped as it is. 'This research can tell us why the universe is arranged
with islands of stars called galaxies, why it has this architecture. I think
these are pretty interesting questions.'
And if you do not find it?
'There must be some mechanism. If it's not the Higgs, we don't know what it
is. But we're going to discover something else instead which we haven't been
clever enough to imagine.'
But what about the cost? I asked. Can you not see a point at which
politicians will stop being interested?
'I would say that convincing politicans is not so hard. To a certain extent
the hardest people to persuade are people in other fields of science because
they are - well, jealous is the right word, I guess.
'It's difficult for people doing biology who need only a few thousand
pounds, a tiny fraction of what is going into Cern. So you get the argument:
why not do biology? It's cheaper than physics. But by the same argument, why
not do theology? It's cheaper than biology. There's a rather nice quote from
a French boulevardiste, one of whose characters asks why he should pay 15
francs for an umbrella when he can have a beer for two sous.'
I thought of the US decision to cancel its Dollars 10bn Superconducting
Super Collider in Texas which would have been three times the length of
Cern's. Scientific advances were quite cheap in the past, I said. Can we
justify our thirst for knowledge indefinitely?
'Well, that's our job in particle physics. We have kept the cost down. The
budget of Cern in real terms is less than it was 20 years ago, despite the
fact that the number of physicists who work here is five times bigger.'
The SFr2.23bn material cost of the Large Hadron Collider will not involve
more than about SFr500m of new money: the bulk will come out of Cern's
existing budget, currently SFr900m a year, as its other experiments wind
down. The two new detectors, costing SFr350m each, may be financed out of
university research budgets.
'People sometimes say it's like the opera and should be subsidised at the
same level. I think it's more than that, because scientific knowledge is
cumulative, it's more like the composition of an opera than the performance,
if you like. The discoveries made in the 19th century are still driving
today's electrical industry, for example. And those in the 30s are driving
semiconductors.'
You may be able to appeal to politicians or to national or European pride, I
said. But won't taxpayers protest if they can't understand what you're up
to?
'That's why I think we have a big obligation to explain what we're doing -
for a grand reason and a pragmatic reason. The grand reason is that we'd
like other people to share in the pleasure we get in the things we're doing:
and if it is a contribution to culture then presumably we can all share it.
'The pragmatic reason, obviously, is if we can't explain then obviously
we're going to lose the support.'
Of course, I said, I'm impressed you can look at the state of the universe
some fraction of a billionth of a second after the Big Bang. But I'd pay a
lot more to know what happened a fraction before.
'In a sense the Big Bang is infinitely far away in terms of its energy
density. In time it's a finite way away. But we never will really get there.
The energy at which one could directly test the theories that put all the
forces together is still a factor of about a million, billion away in terms
of energy.
'It's an interesting question what is in science and what isn't. I think to
paraphrase St Augustine, the most profound question that human beings can
ask is: 'why is there something rather than nothing?'
'Now, that question, it seems to me, is beyond the scope of science and
probably will always be - though there are scientists who think not. On the
other hand, the question we're asking in particle physics is: given that
there is something rather than nothing, why is it what it is, rather than
something else? And that question I think we may be able to answer.'
Would it be better for you if the results are a shock - better than getting
the predicted answer?
'Yes. It's paradoxes that show there's a real question there.'
So when you find the Higgs boson, it's going to be both a triumph and an
anti-climax?
'In a sense to find something different would be more interesting, yes.
That's true.'
If they find the boson, do you get a Nobel prize? The professor laughed.
'Certainly not. Probably Mr Higgs gets a Nobel prize.'
Well, for my fiver, I hope he does.

FT  12 MAR 94 / What kind of ghoul am I?: Dominic Lawson casts a sceptical
eye on the press and Cromwell Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Late last year I was driving at speed down the M4, when the traffic in front
of me began to slow rapidly. So rapidly, that I almost collided with the car
I was following. There were no roadworks. The traffic was not heavy. There
had been no collision or crash. We were near the Windsor junction, and to
the left a building was ablaze.
The drivers who had slowed to 25 miles an hour, and were winding down their
windows to get a better look, could not all have guessed that it was one of
the Queen's residences which was on fire. But someone's palatial home was
being cruelly destroyed and someone's priceless possessions were being
reduced to ashes.
I doubt that at that moment any of the fire-gazers, myself included, felt
much sympathy for the unknown householder. We were just overwhelmed by
curiosity. We were ghouls. Newspapers love the word 'ghoul', chiefly,
perhaps, because its monosyllabic terseness fits into a tabloid headline.
The word has been used repeatedly this week in the reports of the scenes
outside 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester, as, over a period of days, the
remains of nine female bodies have been disinterred and brought out in
boxes.
You would think, from the comments of journalists, that the behaviour of
local sightseers was worse than that of whoever put the bodies there.
Frederick West, a former resident of 25 Cromwell Street, has been charged
with murder.
Paul Callan, the Daily Express's man outside 25 Cromwell Street, and that
newspaper's most talented 'colour' writer, was particularly outraged.
Under the headline 'Place where people just don't care', Callan stigmatised
'the ghoul watch' as a daily, sickening sight. He added to his list of
'sickos' the man who now owns the scaffolding-covered No 25 for 'charging
Pounds 450 for television crews to clamber up, and Pounds 60 for Fleet
Street photographers.'
Well, this is indeed all very shocking.
I imagine we should take it as read that the Daily Express's photographer
was far too noble and sensitive a spirit to pay his Pounds 60 and provide a
picture of what his own newspaper tastefully calls 'The House of Death'.
And I imagine that the editor of the Daily Express was most calm and
understanding when his star photographer explained why it would be unethical
and, let us use the word, ghoulish, to pay Pounds 60 to the owner of number
25.
I also wonder what the newspapers would call the owner if he had not charged
them for their pictures: 'helpful' perhaps. Certainly not 'sick'.
The point, naturally, is that the owners of local properties can make big
money from facilitating 'ghoulish' pictures only if Fleet Street wants to
publish them.
The main distinguishing characteristic of the members of the Cromwell Street
'ghoul watch', is that, unlike most of the tabloid readership, they live
close enough to the scene of the crimes to see it for themselves.
They do not need to cough up 32p for a copy of the Daily Express to see the
photograph which accompanied Callan's article: a shocked looking police
officer emerging from the house carrying a box with a black cloth covering
the unmentionable things which it must have contained.
And about 3in away from Callan's excoriating prose, his employer, under a
bold headline, begs: 'Do you or did you know Fred West, or have any pictures
of him? The Daily Express would like to hear from you - call us on
071-922-7210.' This, presumably is the Daily Express's very own 'ghoul
line'.
Among the Cromwell Street residents whose cynicism has shocked Paul Callan,
is a lady who charges onlookers Pounds 2 for a box of sandwiches. He quotes
her as saying: 'Just providing a service dear.' So are we all, Paul dear, so
are we all. We just have different ways of describing the same activity.
All, together, conjugate after me: I am a newspaper reporter; you are a
Daily Express reader; they are all ghouls.
Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Save the male
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I have won nothing but abuse for my suggestion last week that men today are
getting an amazingly rotten deal in comparison with women, at least in
developed countries; that it is men, not women, who need increased
protection from life's brutalities; and that traditional roles - man the
protector, woman the protected - have become unworkable.
I did not invent these ideas. They have been advanced by Dr Warren Farrell,
a US academic, whose courageous book, The Myth of Male Power, has got me
into such hot water with my executive assistant.
Miss Lee was in fine form this week, feline and pouty. A Thatcherite, she
recently binned all her Jaeger gear and is now stomping about in topline
Versace. The bit from last week's column that caused her the greatest
merriment was Dr Farrell's suggestion - reasonable, civilised  - that we
should care as much about males as we care about whales.
Miss Lee finds this sentiment inexpressibly comedic, and has reacted by
joining Greenpeace (unusual for a Thatcherite, to say the very least) and by
commissioning, from an artist she supports, a painting of killer whales
surfacing off Antarctica.
She breezed in upon me yesterday. Was just off to lunch. Teetering and
tottering. She said: 'The whales are doing fine, Michael; how about you
males?'
I said: 'Oh, supremely funny. It is a pity, Miss Lee, that women can only
chortle at male pain and suffering, because the problem is growing
globally.'
'Fiddlesticks.'
'So tell me this: why do women live longer than men? It is a question
Farrell asks; the answer is upsetting. Quoting from US experience and
statistics, he says that in 1920 women lived one year longer than men. Today
women live seven years longer. Life expectancy for white females is 79; for
black females, 74; for white males, 72; and for black males, 65. 'Power', he
says, 'is the ability to control one's life. Death tends to reduce control.
Life expectancy is the bottom line - the ratio of our life's stresses to our
life's rewards'.
'It gets worse. Blacks die earlier than whites from 12 of the 15 leading
causes of death. But men die earlier than women from all 15 causes. They
include heart disease, accidents, pneumonia and influenza, diabetes
mellitus, suicide, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, kidney inflammation,
Aids, murder.
'In industrialised societies, says Farrell, early deaths are caused more by
diseases triggered by stress, which breaks down the immune system, than in
non-industrialised ones. It is principally stress that is killing men so
much sooner than women.
'Compared with other diseases, heart attack has now become the No 1 killer
of women. But men are still far more vulnerable to death from this cause
than women. Before the age of 65, men still die from heart attack at the
rate of almost 3:1 compared with women. Almost three-quarters of women who
die of heart attack are 75 or older. But by then the average (white) male
has been dead three years.
'Men lose out all round. In the US, 83 per cent of the homeless are male, as
are 90 per cent of deaths from Aids and 94 per cent of the prison
population; 99.99 per cent of the 58,183 names on the Vietnam veterans'
memorial in Washington, DC, are names of men.
'There is a huge amount of data in The Myth of Male Power, plus a great deal
of plucky interpretation. Farrell shatters every assumption about
masculinity you have ever heard. What he has to say is searingly non-PC  -
raw and challenging. Farrell says he does not want to dismantle feminism; he
just wants us to recognise that, in different ways, men too have been
oppressed and damaged by gender role-playing.
'Miss Lee, imagine the uproar if tonight's TV bulletins reported that women
were dying seven years earlier than men, and that women had been identified
as the principal victims of every single one of the 15 leading causes of
death.'
Miss Lee looked amused. Shook her expensive hair. Straightened the platinum
Dalmatian brooch stuck in the lapel of her Versace.
She said: 'Try and get some air, Michael. Walk across the bridge. Get
yourself a sandwich. You look pasty-faced and stressed, and that jacket
needs cleaning. I would hate something to happen to you. Try a new haircut.
You have got to get a life.'

FT  12 MAR 94 / FT Round the World Ski Expedition
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world expedition. Arnie writes:
Early March was grim - heavy rain, ice and thick fog. In North Carolina we
slithered to a halt on a steep road to Hawksnest, unable to continue (it
turned out to be closed anyway). And we missed Sugar Mountain completely in
the fog, ending up at Beech Mountain where visibility was so appalling that
for self-preservation we skied only three runs.
When the fog lifted we found Sugar Mountain, the biggest skiing area in the
valley, and made a determined effort to make up for lost time by
night-skiing.
Reaching Snowshoe, West Virginia, brought a sigh of relief - a real ski
resort with a 1,200ft vertical drop and one particularly exhilarating run
called Cupp Trail, 1 1/2 miles long. We have enjoyed North America
enormously, but now can't wait to arrive in Europe on Monday.
Readers could win a skiing holiday in Courmayeur, or ski equipment, by
entering the competition which appeared in Weekend FT on March 5 (copies
from the FT shop, tel: 071-873 3324).

FT  12 MAR 94 / Skiing: Tales of grizzly bears and T-bars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At Whitefish, Montana, they still laugh at the events of December, 1947,
when more than a thousand local people from the Flathead Valley made their
way to the slopes of Big Mountain to witness an historic event: the opening
of the first ski-lift.
Ed Schenck and George Prentice, the principal investors in what was
originally known as the Hell Roaring Ski Corporation (named after a nearby
mountain) had spent half the night getting the lift ready.
This is Schenck's account: 'We sat down with the book of instructions and
tried to puzzle out how to adjust the T-bars. The directions said to turn
the retracting spring 11 times. Working by candle and flashlight, we did
this.
'Next morning, the motor coughed, and the first skiers took off. 'Oh no]'
George howled, and turned his reddening face away.
'Instead of riding up the hill with the T-bar supporting them under their
hips, these first riders were dangling 10 feet in the air and spinning round
and round. It was like a Bob Hope movie.
'The retracting spring had evidently been wound up sufficiently at the
factory. But since most of the skiers hadn't seen a T-bar lift before, they
didn't know anything was wrong. So George and I kept straight faces and
finished the day]'
Things have progressed in the ski industry in Montana since then. For those
who find Colorado and even Utah expensive and touristy (as all good places
tend to become) Montana may indeed live up to its reputation as 'The Last
Best Place'. A surprising number of local skiers are refugees from Colorado.
With more than 60 trails served by nine lifts, a vertical drop of 2,300ft
and a longest run of 2.5 miles, plus night-skiing and Snow Cat skiing, The
Big Mountain - Montana's biggest ski area - provides as much good skiing as
most of its better known counterparts. And a lift ticket costs Dollars 32
(Pounds 21) - Dollars 10 cheaper than the norm in Colorado.
The Big Mountain, 19 miles from Glacier Park International Airport in
north-west Montana, is isolated from other ski areas in the north-west. But
in the south west of the state an assortment of resorts enables visiting
skiers with a rental car to try a good cross-section.
If you hanker after steep but manageable terrain, head for Bridger Bowl up
in the Crazy Mountains (named after the sole woman survivor of an Indian
massacre who wandered the area and finally went mad) and the Bangtail
Mountains (named after the wild horses whose tails, knotted with frozen
snow, could be heard in winter banging against their thighs).
Bridger (lift ticket Dollars 24) is a smallish cult resort just to the north
of Yellowstone National Park which attracts skiers in search of off-piste
thrills. There are good nursery slopes (50 trails altogether) but they are
not what the local powder hounds, or 'Ridge Hippies' come for.
The main quest for these hounds is The Ridge, an extreme area with terrain
verying between challenging and suicidal, leading to The Nose, The Apron and
the North and South Bowls, ony reached by a short sharp hike. (There is a
rope tow to the top, but it is exclusively for the use of the Ski Patrol.)
With runs like Must Turn Left, Sometimes A Great Notion and Avalanche Gully
(none of which is shown on the official trail map) to choose from, it is
best to ski The Ridge with someone who knows what they are doing and where
they are going. I was accompanied by Doug Wales, Bridger's marketing
director.
Mercifully, Doug did not take me into the steep and narrow Hidden Gully
entrance into the Apron since I found the Apron itself challenging enough to
make me go wandering in the Crazy Mountains myself.
Yellowstone has another big ski area on its doorstep: Big Sky - reached,
like Bridger, from Bozeman. It too has recently opened up one area just for
advanced skiing - Lone Mountain, at 11,166ft, where the new Challenger lift
serves only single and double black diamond runs.
Contrary to Bridger Bowl, which has to remind skiers that it has ordinary
cruising runs and beginner slopes, Big Sky needed the Challenger lift
because it had a reputation for not enough advanced terrain.
With 65 miles of mainly beginner and intermediate skiing predominantly on
Andesite Mountain, and even some European-style gondolas - a rarity in the
US - Big Sky is still essentially a resort for the average family skier to
cruise all day (lift ticket Dollars 38).
Another resort in the region worth visiting is Red Lodge, rejoicing in
better days now that it has changed its name from Grizzly Peak. Any bear
attack anywhere in the Rockies used to send skiers into a panic, even during
winter when bears - if any - would be hibernating. The mountain itself still
retains the name Grizzly Peak.
Skiers at Red Lodge frequently enjoy a classic temperature inversion that
enables then to ski at almost 10,000ft in relative warmth of temperatures
above freezing, while the nearest big town, Billings might be several
degrees colder.
With a Dollars 24 lift ticket, Red Lodge has 35 trails, a vertical drop of
just over 2,000ft and has plans to build North America's first ski resort
funicular to get skiers on to the slopes from the car park and from the
quaint little town of Red, often used as the setting for western movies.
When Ed Schenck first arrived in Montana he recalls that a 'committee
dressed in coonskin caps and snowshoes took me up to inspect the skiing
country. They were as eager to please as rental agents in a ghost town.
'When we finally struggled to the top, we found breathtaking, vast, open
snowfields where you can ski in any direction, seven-foot deep snow topped
by soft powder, and sunshine - all the things a skier dreams about.'
Those dreams have now become practical possibilities.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Sport: The jilted brokers of the big match - Is English
football doomed? Peter Berlin scans another blueprint for the game
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is sometimes difficult to recall, in the gloom that has enveloped English
football how narrow the margin of World Cup failure was. If in two similar
positions (Des Walker grabs Marc Overmars' shirt outside England's penalty
area, Overmars falls inside penalty area; Ronald Koeman grabs David Platt's
shirt outside the Dutch penalty area, Platt falls inside penalty area) the
refereeing decisions had been reversed (no penalty to the Netherlands;
penalty to England) things would be different.
England would be heading for the World Cup finals; Terry Venables would
still be out of work; Peter Beardsley, Matthew Le Tissier and Darren
Anderton would not have played for England against Denmark on Wednesday and
Out of Time, Why Football Isn't Working] by Alex Fynn and Lynton Guest would
not be high in the sports best seller list. The book struck a nerve with
despondent English fans.
Fynn and Guest were two of the losers in the money-spinning summer of 1992
when the Premier League broke from the Football League and then negotiated a
Pounds 304m television contract with BSkyB.
Guest, a journalist, was involved with FTC, a small television company,
which was briefly involved in the television bidding process. Fynn, an
executive at Saatchi and Saatchi, the advertising agency, provided the
Football Association with the mouthwatering financial projections it used as
bait to attract the top clubs to its breakaway league. But Saatchi and then
Fynn were spurned as contracts and jobs were handed out. The marketing
strategy he had offered the FA was forgotten.
The core of this book is the two chapters on the creation of the Premier
League and the subsequent television negotiations. Fynn was behind, or just
outside, the locked doors as the deals were done and the boots flew. The
writers offer an account which has not appeared elsewhere, settle a few
scores and point out where football went wrong; that is, where it deviated
from Fynn's blueprint.
The two insist they are not just insiders but fans too - Guest supports
Leicester, Fynn Newcastle. The proof lies in the rest of the book, much of
which reads as if it was largely written on a particularly angry night in
the pub; notably the tedious, second-hand fan-rants against former England
manager Graham Taylor which begin and end the book.
Fynn's blueprint is a marketing man's plan for football. The best way to
sell the sport is to organise a league in which matches are scarce and every
one is an event, a contest between glamorous teams with national profiles.
To do this the FA must shrink the top division to exclude clubs with local
profiles. These must maximise their income by playing in regional divisions
which multiply local derbies.
Fynn argues that a successful national team helps sell the game at all
levels. By happy chance his plan for the league is also good for the
national team: reducing the number of club matches cuts wear and tear on
players.
For Fynn, big clubs are good, smaller clubs are bad. Fynn attacks the TV
arrangements in the UK because in the bulk of satellite-free households
children will be deprived of the chance to support the big, glamorous clubs
and must, instead, become fans of the first division clubs they see on ITV.
The book laments the fall of Liverpool (victims of the system) and praises
AC Milan (owned by Silvio Berlusconi, who Fynn has advised).
Fynn tells how the FA surrendered the initiative on the Premier League in a
clandestine meeting at Goodison Park, Everton's ground, between the FA and
representatives of the biggest clubs, at which Fynn seems to have been
present.
He writes: 'Concluding the meeting Philip Carter (chairman of Everton) said:
'Well gentlemen . . . all that remains to do is elect our chief executive.'
. . . Charles Hughes (the FA's director of coaching) broke in . . . 'We
already have a chief executive there.' He pointed at a rather
uncomfortable-looking Graham Kelly (chief executive of the FA). Kelly said
nothing and the opportunity was gone.'
Rather than keep the league under FA control, Kelly let Rick Parry, an
accountant, become chief executive. With the league granted independence it
fell under the political control of Ken Bates, chairman of Chelsea, champion
of the middle-sized club, and the man who had promoted the return to a
22-club first division.
Bates, says Fynn, does not believe football matches should be scarce. He
believes in 'a marginal costing system'. Since a club's costs are largely
fixed, more games mean more profit. A bigger league and more cup
competitions are, therefore, good things. This view is shared by the
middle-sized clubs who form the bulk of the top English division.
Bates' political objective was to ensure these clubs had equal power in the
Premier League. After the league was set up, Bates crowed: 'David Dein
(vice-chairman of Arsenal) was so over the moon at getting his little
Premier League and couldn't understand why Ken Bates was so supportive. We
got a few things in there . . . He is only now begining to realise what hit
him. One club, one vote, no committees . . . so you have no permanent chance
to be in the corridors of power.'
Bates also set the agenda for the television deal that followed. Fynn thinks
this was a marketing disaster: the football weekend spread over three days,
all the tiddlers guaranteed live matches, the big clubs largely restricted
to satellite. The league, says Fynn, could have negotiated a much better
deal. But the decision to opt for BSkyB was not purely financial. Bates and
his mates were prepared to accept a slightly smaller pie, so long as they
kept their hands on the cake slice.
Bates commands an army of 12 to 14 middle-sized clubs each with one vote in
the 22-team Premier League. I asked Fynn how he could overcome Bates. 'I
intend to persuade him that Chelsea are one of the big clubs,' he said.
But Fynn can hardly perform the same trick with Coventry or Wimbledon. To
persuade them to do as Raith Rovers have done in Scotland and vote for a
smaller Premier League knowing that such a change could bring them
relegation, would test the most resourceful marketing man.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Sport: Concertina plays blues for Intrum - Sailing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whitbread sailors call it 'the concertina', but its music has no charms.
When the fleet is stretched out in line, racing to the finish, a breeze that
dies from the leaders backwards will have the effect of bunching the yachts.
In the last two days this nautical torture has been inflicted on Intrum
Justitia as she set the pace towards the end of leg four in Punta del Este,
Uruguay.
On Wednesday night Intrum, skippered by British yachtsman Lawrie Smith, was
91 miles ahead of her closest rivals Tokio and Yamaha and seemed a certain
bet to take the Heineken trophy for the leg. By morning it was a different
story. The breeze was soft and right on the nose, behind them Tokio and
Yamaha had closed the gap to a mere 25 miles with only 445 miles left to the
finish.
'We're treating this stage like an inshore race in the English Channel,
sleeping on the rail instead of going down below,' said Pierre Maas,
Intrum's watchleader over the radio. 'But at least we've proved that we can
be fast in light airs as well as in the strong running conditions.'
Just prior to Cape Horn the yacht set another 24-hour record with a 428-mile
run.
Overall, Tokio holds a 17-hour lead from the rest of the highly competitive
W60 class. Three other yachts, Yamaha, Intrum and Galicia Pescanova, are
good enough to catch her but with the race two-thirds gone, time is running
out.
Yamaha left Southampton six months ago as the favourite. Since then she has
been dogged by misfortune, some of it self-inflicted with repeated changes
in the crucial navigator role. Now, she is making up ground on Intrum, and
could be second into Uruguay.
'The wind is forecast to head us and stay in the north for a day and a half.
It'll come down to who picks the weather best,' said skipper Ross Field.
Aboard Tokio, the young Kiwi Chris Dickson is frustrated. 'We had a
spinnaker on for the first time in seven days,' he told Punta via Inmarsat.
'It's unbelievable that in this downwind race we have been going upwind for
so damn long.
'It's tough on the boat, gear and the people. We were geared for spinnaker
work but we've had 90 per cent headwinds. It's like going skiing and getting
a five-minute run at the beginning of the day, before spending the next 48
hours struggling uphill into a blizzard with your skis on your back.'
Compared with the trauma aboard British entry Dolphin, lying eighth, Tokio
has the problems of a poor little rich kid.
'Since we left Auckland three weeks ago the primary winch has been ripped
from the deck, three keel bolts have sheared, the headfoil which holds the
jib in place has shattered and the mainsail has been shredded into pieces,'
said 23-year-old skipper Matt Humphries. 'The heavy No 1 genoa has been
transformed into a mainsail and brass hanks fitted to a spare jib so that we
can fly a foresail. But we are still about 60 sq m down on sail area and the
girls on Heineken are catching us fast.'
All 14 yachts had a relatively easy passage around Cape Horn, although the
week before they rounded the bleak headland was rough and uncomfortable,
with some of the strongest winds and most complex weather systems the
skippers have had to face.
Marcel van Triest, Intrum's navigator, said: 'During that second week in the
Southern Ocean there were so many low pressure centres, if we had got it
just slightly wrong we could have been down the drain like Winston.' (The US
entry took a gamble and ended up 150 miles behind the leaders in less than
day.)
The past week illustrates perfectly the complexity and richness of the
Whitbread. A week ago the crews were lucky to see so much as an albatross as
they shivered below deck in wet sleeping bags with the temperature only just
above freezing. On deck there was 50 knots of wind and a helmsman wearing a
full face mask and ski goggles.
Yesterday, reported New Zealand Endeavour, the red dust from the Argentinian
pampas was blown 250 miles offshore, dirtying the foredeck, and the crew was
sunbathing in shorts and T-shirts. At the helm it was a minute-by-minute
battle just to keep the 27 tonnes of maxi-ketch moving through the water.
Intrum was in sight just over two miles ahead.
'Light weather isn't perfect but it suits us. For the first time in days
we've been able to put time on every yacht in the fleet,' said skipper Grant
Dalton. His maxi is second on the water to Intrum but against the sluggish
maxi rivals Merit Cup and la Poste, his race is as good as won. The W60s
still have everything to play for.

FT  12 MAR 94 / As They Say In Europe: Sons of Amon Goth queue for tickets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sins of the fathers are being visited on the sons, and grandsons, in no
uncertain terms these days. The latest manifestation is the Schindler's List
phenomenon. The Holocaust is now enshrined in a Hollywood epic, a fact that
has caused some to object, and others much heartache and heartsearching.
Liberation dedicated six pages on one day alone to the film and its
ramifications. The Lisbon weekly Expresso devoted a full 15 pages of its
review section not only to the film but also to a lesson in history for an
audience geographically as remote as one could be in Europe from the events
recounted.
In Austria, a country in which recent history has been overlooked, the
Vienna city government reserved 7,500 cinema seats for schoolchildren free
of charge.
In the German press there are even now some old scores to be settled: there
is scarcely a mention of the sadistic camp commander, Amon Goth, who plays
such a large part in the film, without the ascription, Der Wiener - the
Viennese. There is no end to the research. The Tageszeitung of Berlin found
survivors in Florida who knew Schindler after the war and those who could
testify how unloved the man was in his own community.
In Switzerland, the Neue Zurcher ran a feature on an overlooked hero,
Berthold Beitz of the Krupp concern, who saved many Jews in what is now
Ukraine. The paper was fascinated by two questions: how had Alfred Krupp
been able to become one of the richest men in the world having been
convicted of the exploitation of slave labour? And how could the Nazis have
acted 'without any economic logic' in pursuit of their programme?
It is evident that the present generation in western Europe, at least, finds
the story incomprehensible, except in the sense that it is known to have
happened. There is a suggestion that Schindler's List gains impact from
events in Bosnia but the truth is probably the other way round.
In eastern Europe the position is murkier. The communists concealed the
reality of the Final Solution by turning it into a tale of communist heroism
in the anti-fascist struggle. Today those societies are having to come to
terms with problems that were ignored or rejected. Thus in the Czech
republic there is agonising over the law on the restitution of Jewish
property which presents entirely different problems from those associated
with property confiscated by the communists.
The Russian news agency, Tass, described the film as 'documenting one German
man's effort to help Jews trapped in Hitler's Germany'. Poland is where the
events occurred and the film was made and reaction there has been mixed.
There is pride that Poland and Poles should have played a part in making the
film, and there is anger that it highlights Polish anti-Semitism. One paper,
Slowo, said Nazi officials were portrayed in a sympathetic light compared
with the Poles. Slowo has it in for Schindler himself: he was 'a spy in
Poland before the war'. And he 'saved only those who were rich', a charge
which must be absurd as the victims had already been robbed.
The film critic of Rzeczpospolita wondered why it had been left to Hollywood
to produce the definitive film. 'Had one to be, perhaps, at a distance,
physically withdrawn from Cracow, Auschwitz, Plaszow? Or was it, perhaps,
essential to await Spielberg's talent? I feel, nevertheless, some pain and
some shame that it was not a Pole, someone from here, who dared to tackle
the subject.'
In much of the former communist world the story creates difficulties. In
some countries today to have had a record of working for the Nazis is a
certificate of anti-communism. Ordinary patriotism was suppressed by the
great slab of imperial socialism for 40 years and, today among the etiolated
weeds of nationalism creep those who thrived in the dark. There will be some
watching Schindler's List, in eastern Europe particularly, who will side
with the perpetrators rather than the victims.
But the question remains: why it should have taken so long for the events to
make such an impact.
Those who were responsible have now passed from positions of power and
influence. If you were a servant of the Reich and 20 in 1944 you were among
the last who could have behaved abominably. Today you would be 70. For three
or four decades after the war, the truth was kept at a distance as veterans
of mass-murder and collaboration took their positions at the helm of
industry, the judiciary and the civil service.
Today they have retired and horrors are revived that should have been
confronted a generation ago. As a result it is the grandchildren who suffer
a confrontation with history that the authors were spared.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Despatches: Where the wounds of war heal slowly - Leslie
Crawford travels through a battle-weary country / Mozambique
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mozambique Island lost contact with civilisation during the 17-year civil
war which scarred the country to which it gave its name.
Cut off from mainland Mozambique by anti-government rebels and abandoned by
its Portuguese merchants, the small coral island only became accessible
again after news of a peace accord, signed in Rome, filtered back last year.
Until recently, it was imprudent to travel to Mozambique Island without the
protection of military escorts. Along the main road from Nampula, 100 miles
inland, the bus driver pointed out the wreckage of rebel attacks as if they
were scenic spots on a tourist route. Twenty-five peasants killed on a bend
of the road; a white farmer ambushed just beyond a rocky outcrop; whole
villages burned down and their men marched into the bush.
Curiously, the driver seemed to bear little resentment towards the 'bandits'
who had caused so much havoc. He even thought the Mozambique National
Resistance (Renamo) rebels might win the elections in October. The
government, he said, had stolen too much and people were tired of hearing
about foreign aid which never arrived.
While haggling continued over the terms of the peace accord in Maputo, the
capital far to the south, the war in Nampula was definitely over. There was
maize and cotton in the fields, new huts of baked red earth, and mangoes for
sale on the side of the road.
The island, like every settlement in Mozambique, was divided into an
'African' town of thatched huts and the 'stone-built' town of their colonial
masters. A mere 19 years of independence, most of it under Marxist rule, had
not been enough to erase five centuries of segregated urban planning.
The stone-built town was in ruins. Vast mansions of Portuguese, Arab and
Goan merchants had been stripped of everything that could be burned or
traded for fuel. The warehouses by the sea-front, built when Mozambique
Island was the busiest entrepot between Europe and the far east, were now
empty save for a few scavenging goats. The town council did its best to
preserve the old governor's palace, which had been a Jesuit monastery in the
17th century, but the roof leaked and there was no money to replaster the
crumbling exterior.
In spite of the decay, the stone-built town was inhabited by several hundred
refugees from the civil war. There were children everywhere, playing with
hoops. It began to rain and they splashed in puddles, and stood under broken
drainpipes for impromptu showers. I took refuge in a courtyard and watched
the rain cascade down a stone stairway.
There was no food at the inn, no electricity, and I was warned not to
venture out after dark. The islanders were afraid of vampires and threw
stones at strangers who prowled the streets at night.
Beira, along the coast to the south, was also plagued by power cuts and an
even bigger refugee crisis, although the belief in vampires did not seem to
form part of the local folklore there.
The fighting there reached the outskirts of town and the hotels, abandoned
by the Portuguese after independence, were overflowing with squatters. Few
buildings had running water. Refuse was left to rot on the streets. The port
and the railway corridor to Zimbabwe were working, thanks to millions of
dollars of foreign aid, but the resettlement of refugees had yet to begin.
On the outskirts of Beira, a tall, blonde woman was erecting tents for war
orphans, hundreds of whom live on the streets of Beira. Barbara Hofmann, a
32-year-old former Swiss banker, had spent three years trying to get
planning permission for a school and boarding house. As she was not prepared
to bribe the authorities, the permit was not forthcoming, so she looked
after her children in makeshift surroundings.
It was difficult to see the scars of war on these young faces. But Barbara
quietly named one or another and recited their traumas. Many saw their
parents being murdered; some were forced to take part in the gruesome
killings - a kind of 'psychological warfare' frequently practised by the
South African-backed rebels.
The received wisdom in Maputo was that Mozambique was tired of war, and that
the long-suffering peasantry would forgive the atrocities committed by
Renamo and the government. And against all expectations, the ceasefire has
now held for more than a year, while old enemies prepare to do battle in the
electoral arena.
The key to peace has been money - lots of it - liberally supplied by donor
governments, aid agencies and the UN. Peacekeeping in Mozambique has been
reduced to a cynical formula of financial inducements: belligerent generals
must be pensioned off; rival armies must be lured into UN assembly points
for demobilisation. Afonso Dhlakama, Renamo's leader, has to be given a big
enough campaign chest to persuade him to fight an election, which donors
will then ask him to lose.
The present government may be incompetent, but Dhlakama's rag-tag army of
bush fighters are not a reassuring alternative.
Mozambicans say they are witnessing the end of an era, a particularly cursed
one, without knowing what the new one will bring. The Marxist ideals which
carried Mozambique to independence have been discarded; South Africa, which
destabilised its neighbour to such devastating effect, is now Mozambique's
biggest trading partner. There is no shame attached to living from foreign
handouts, but equally no vestige of nationalist pride.
Old habits, however, die hard. At the Polana, one of the finest colonial
hotels in Africa, a white Mozambican lashes out at a porter for using the
informal 'tu'. 'Did you go to school with me?' the white man shouts in a
drunken rage, again and again. 'Learn to address your superiors with
respect.'

FT  12 MAR 94 / Travel: A Tuscan history lesson - The Arno and Tiber valleys
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE GARDINER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the forest you walk on velvet. The only sound along paths of deep-piled
leaf-mould is that of a beech leaf or prickly chestnut detaching itself.
Here in middle Tuscany you see no bird or animal, nothing on the move until
next Thursday when the forestry vehicle passes by. The occasional woodcutter
stares in amazement: 'What are you doing up here? Looking for mushrooms?'
You cross a clearing, the fairy ring of the charcoal- burners, a vanished
trade. You come to a silent village which has sprouted off the rock, under
the woodland canopy, as harmoniously as a clump of flowers.
The pink marsiglia pantiles, all askew, are reinforced with flagstones, the
lintels pitted with chisel marks, the doors tied up with old stockings and
the cracks in the bulging walls strapped with iron bands. A woman in peasant
black stares at you.
We are on the horseshoe curve of hills which encloses the Casentino, the
valley of the infant Arno river. From one side you might almost see the
domes of Florence, from the other the tower blocks of Rimini. Up the valley
a road and a light railway crawl this way and that, looking for the Arno's
source. One or two roads struggle up to the watershed and, at summit level,
you can park your car and walk into that rarest of modern Italian qualities
 -solitude.
History ancient and modern is locked up in these hills. On a small road
above Arezzo we explored La Verna's rock-cut monastery, important in the
life of St Francis of Assisi. Displayed here are his staff, rope girdle,
sandals and flagella. On Sundays the place is thronged. Several hundred sit
down to lunch which, being prepared by the monks, is cheap and ghastly.
I walked the Pratomagno or 'Great Meadow,' starting at Vallombrosa where
Milton played the organ. The switchback trail along the tops begins at a
lonely rifugio where huntsmen, at 8am, were drinking brandy and cursing the
mist. It was misty all the way. Long before I saw it I heard the wind
whistling through the latticework of the Croce di Pratomagno.
Nearby I located the stone which commemorates Bert Hinkler, long-distance
aviator and native of Queensland. A wreath of flowers lies there,
camouflaged in fallen leaves. The Australian ambassador had been up there a
few days earlier in a helicopter, marking the 60th anniversary of the night
when Hinkler in his Puss Moth, en route from Croydon in England to Sydney,
crashed into the mountains. Two months later, when the snows had melted, a
shepherd found the wreckage and a search party found the body, some distance
away, partly eaten by foxes.
From heights like these you look down on the Casentino with its steady
stream of traffic and a rail-car which stops at every wayside halt. Down
there, promiscuous housing spreads over the fields where Dante fought in the
last battle of the civil wars. Down there, light industry pollutes the
Casentino brooks which, in Dante's Inferno, tormented souls longed for.
Italy's economic growth has transformed rural Tuscany. It is hard in that
semi-industrial scene to pick out the box-like 12th-century towers of the
Guidi counts which dot the course of the Arno.
Never mind. It is still haunted, hallowed ground. This district was the
seed-plot of Renaissance genius. Pratovecchio, terminus of the little train,
gave birth to Paolo Uccello, whose Battle of San Romano used to hang over
Lorenzo de' Medici's bed.
Masaccio, enfant terrible of the Florence art scene (his name meant 'Wicked
Tom'), was born at Loro Ciuffenna on the Pratomagno. Vicchio, just beyond
the horseshoe of the hills, was the cradle of Giotto. From the valley towns
came Vasari and Petrarch (Arezzo), Luca Signorelli and Fra Angelico
(Cortona).
Both the Arno and Tiber rise in these hills. On a green-topped hill between
them sits Caprese Michelangelo, crowned with a feudal castle. I walked into
the bar and asked the barmaid, aged about 12: 'Who is this Michelangelo?'
'I don't understand you.'
'You have a Michelangelo birthplace, a Michelangelo bar. Who is he? Some
politician?'
The child took a deep breath. 'He was no less than the greatest artist who
ever lived. If you could see his works, signore, you would say they were
done not by the hand of man but by the hand of God.'
He was born there by accident; he does not really belong to the local
pantheon. His mother was making her way to Rome when a thunderstorm
frightened the horses. The carriage overturned and she went into labour. The
Buonarotti family owned the local castello, so she stayed there until the
baby was born. In the 1920s the government started dignifying place-names
with the names of native celebrities - Sasso Marconi, Arqua Petrarca, Torre
del Lago Puccini. Caprese became Caprese Michelangelo.
The local hero, however, is not Michelangelo but Piero della Francesca, born
at Sansepolcro. His works are scattered over the countryside in churches,
cemetery chapels and dusty municipal halls. Often they are protected by
nothing more than a frayed rope and the jealous piety of villagers. When
Charles de Gaulle persuaded the mayor of Monterchi to lend Piero's Madonna
del Parto for a Paris exhibition, women lay in the road and refused to let
it go.
Sansepolcro has Piero's Resurrection, which Aldous Huxley considered the
finest painting in the world, but this artist's supreme legacy was the
series of frescoes which illustrates The Legend of the Cross at Arezzo, on
the walls of what looks like a disused barn but is really the old church of
San Francesco.
The Casentino and upper Tiber valley, popular with Italian weekend tourists
and art students, are not much penetrated by foreigners. A bungaloid rash,
and the quarries and new roads which disfigure the Pratomagno slopes, do not
encourage exploration. In 20 years this has become a different world, but a
few communities remain intact. The flagged lanes of Poppi; the perfect
defensive ring of Anghiari's walls; the whole town of Sansepolcro inside its
gates and the upper town of Arezzo haven't changed in seven centuries.
The stone sockets of town houses blossom with banners on days of
celebration. At weekends the crossbowmen and flag-jugglers sustain ancient
rivalries in explosive encounters; for the rest of the time the citizens
move serenely and aimlessly about - 'Like fish in an aquarium,' I suggested.
'Like characters in Piero's paintings,' said my guide.
Arezzo's hotels are cheaper and less sophisticated than those of Florence;
nevertheless, at the Minerva, Etrusco or Continentale you may pay up to
Pounds 60 a night. Sansepolcro's best, in a picturesque setting, is La
Balestra, about Pounds 40 a night. There are serious parking problems in
this town.
Most villages of the Casentino have adequate small hotels, sometimes
attached to gourmet restaurants, sometimes closed in winter. Notable among
them are Parc Hotel at Poppi (Pounds 40), Buca di Michelangelo at Caprese
(Pounds 26), Fonte della Galletta at Alpe Faggeto (Pounds 28), Oliver at
Anghiari (Pounds 36) and Croce di Savoia at Vallombrosa (Pounds 45). All
these places are in red Michelin.
For walkers and cyclists among the hills, almost every hamlet has its
locanda (private lodging house) at under Pounds 12 a night, including food.
All Casentino and Tiber valley localities have bus connections with Arezzo
and Sansepolcro, at least once a day.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Travel: Care to share? Life on Siberia's frontier - At her
room in the 'bureaucratic hotel' in Kemerovo Lori Cidylo is taken aback by
an uninvited companion . . .

In the frozen vastness of Siberia, the air singes your cheek and your breath
freezes into a cluster of shimmering ice crystals that Siberians call the
whisper of stars. As the first flush of daylight bursts through, life in the
forest begins to stir. The pine trees stretch their limbs as the snow starts
to melt under the first rays of the sun. A white hare pops out of a
snow-covered hollow and twitches its pink nose, sniffing the air.
Ruddy-cheeked women, heavily bundled against the cold, emerge from log
cabins to traverse country roads in search of firewood while burly men in
fur caps cut holes in the ice of a frozen lake and thrust their fishing
poles into its depths.
In this land of legend and adventure, where the temperature can fall to  -
50`C, amazing things can happen. Steel cranes can snap in mid-air and
camera-film shatter like crystal.
Life in Siberia is evocative of life in the US in the days of the open
frontier. Many people have no telephones or running water. Water is trucked
in once a week and must be hauled from wells which often freeze in winter.
Galina Pushkaryova, a typically buxom Siberian with an iron constitution,
could hardly suppress her laughter when she opened her front door and saw me
standing there wrapped in so many layers, including two pairs of gloves,
that only my eyes were visible - and still I could not stop shivering.
Quickly she pulled me inside, and soon I was sitting in front of a fire
sampling some of the many exotic dishes Siberian cuisine has to offer.
Galina spread a lavish table which included home-made goose soup, pyelmyeni
(similar to Italian ravioli, but without the tomato sauce), and black bread,
before bringing out some elk meat and a bottle of throat-searing vodka.
'One shot of this and soon you'll be walking around without gloves,' Galina
said with a wink as she downed a glass with gusto.
'Siberians have a saying: if a person doesn't drink, he must be either very
ill or a complete scoundrel,' said Valentina Rumantseva, a local doctor.
Many Siberians start the day by dousing themselves with a pitcher of
ice-cold water. Local wisdom has it that this ritual strengthens the body's
immunity. Indeed, even the youngest natives seem to thrive. Siberian
children can toboggan before they can walk. When the barometer dips very
low, they spill water to form a slick sheet of ice in front of their houses,
and spend hours playing ice hockey.
Siberia is not a republic, and has no definite borders. It begins roughly at
the Ural mountains and runs eastwards for thousands of miles of forest
steppe, tiger and tundra. Yet there must be scarcely a person alive who does
not know what Siberia is and where it is - certainly no Russian.
Siberia occupies a unique place in the Russian soul. It is a well-spring of
romance, adventure, suffering and dread. Many of its people are the
descendants of those who were forced to travel there by train or on foot,
sometimes in chains, to live in the dark reaches of exile.
The city of Kemerovo had several prison camps. But there are other reminders
of the past. The huge chemical factories that made the city an industrial
giant during the Soviet era are still among the main sources of employment.
Siberia has no tourist attractions. Indeed, one can easily be lured into
treacherous wilds from which there may be no escape. 'The forest looks very
beautiful, but it is also very dangerous,' said Galina. 'If you were to go
inside, it would be almost impossible to find your way out because, to an
inexperienced eye, each path looks exactly the same. Your chances of
survival would be very slim. You would either die from cold and hunger or
you would be devoured by wild animals.'
There are many novel ways to quench your thirst for adventure which are
quite harmless. One is the banya po chornomu or 'black bath', the Siberian
sauna, a unique experience which Siberians believe can relieve almost
anything that ails you, from bronchitis to a bad heart.
'It's a feeling you won't forget,' said Tatiana Novikova, a local
entrepreneur, of the sauna's effects both on psyche and body. 'Afterwards,
you can run in the snow barefoot and you won't even feel the cold.'
Unable to resist the promise of such a treat, our group, which consisted of
four Germans, three Russians and one American, piled into a Jeep and drove
in search of a famed local sauna once reserved for the communist elite and
now frequented by the post-Soviet jet set.
At last we discovered a cosy, lace-curtained log cabin hidden among a covey
of trees. Inside, we were greeted by the scent of fresh pine. Obeying
Tatiana's instructions, we wrapped ourselves in sheets and donned hats to
keep our hair from getting scorched. Soon, we were sitting on wooden planks
in a steaming hot cocoon, inhaling the dry, pine-scented air.
The prescription is precise: one shot of vodka followed by a massage, a cold
shower and two hours in the sauna. But the curative effect is ensured only
after the final step. After emerging from the sauna, dripping wet, Siberians
often take a roll in the snow, in the buff. Being a modest lot, we omitted
that bit.
After the sauna, I decided to return to my hotel and relax before dinner,
but there was a complication: I could not recall the name of my hotel. So I
called Galina, who had made the reservation for me. 'This is rather
embarrassing,' I said, but can you tell me the name of my hotel?'
'It doesn't have a name,' she said.
Finally, I found it. It took half-an-hour. I was beginning to suspect it had
no address, either. I asked the clerk if it really had no name.
Surprised at my question, the clerk, an old woman, replied: 'Yes, it's
true.' The hotel was what is known as a vedomstvennaya gostinitsa, literally
a 'bureaucratic hotel,' and turned out to be as nightmarish as it sounded.
Such hotels, I learned, are affiliated to a particular enterprise, in this
case a factory, and are frequented by people who come to work there
temporarily. Reservations are made by the employee's nachalnik (boss). A
call from such a highly-placed personage and a room is assured; the
management has no right to refuse.
On my second day at the hotel, the clerk informed me that a woman had just
arrived and was staying in my room. Since I was expecting a friend from
Moscow, I was sure it must be her. I bounded up the stairs and rapped on the
door.
'Tanya, it's me.'
'Just a minute.'
When the door opened, I found myself face to face with a stout matron in her
mid-50s who regarded me severely. We stood motionless. 'Excuse me,' I
ventured, 'I think I have the wrong room.' I checked the number on the door.
No 8: my room. So who was this woman?
She told me that her name was Yelena and that she had come to work at the
factory affiliated to the hotel. I asked the clerk if there was anything to
be done about this distressing situation. The answer was negative. 'All I do
is take orders,' she explained.
I returned to my room. 'Don't worry. I won't bother you a bit,' said my new
friend, who was already in bed and puffing a cigarette, creating noxious
rings of smoke. Her clothes were strewn across the floor. 'You won't even
notice that I'm here.' Shortly after that she was snoring like a chainsaw.
To get to Siberia from London you can travel to Moscow with British Airways.
From Moscow, only Aeroflot, the former Soviet airline, goes to Siberia. In
Kemerovo there are three real hotels, not affiliated to any enterprise: the
Tom Hotel, the Tsentralniy Hotel and the Kuzbass Hotel, which is the best of
the three. Aeroflot is at 70 Piccadilly, London W1 V9HH. Tel: 071-491-1764.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Travel: Biblical moments in muddy Madeira
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES WHITTELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An accordianist wandered among the tables. He smiled benignly as the rain
slammed against the glass wall. The waiter in his turquoise tux brought the
crab and crevettes as the wind whined through the leading. We asked to move
tables. No trouble at all. The wine and ice-bucket followed us like shadows.
We sipped 1906 Malmsey after coffee and stumbled happily back to the hotel
over decorative cobbles, thinking that the wind always made Madeira's palm
trees dance like dervishes.
Next morning, Funchal's esplanade was under an inch of mud. The famous tidal
pool at Reid's Hotel had rocks in it. The previous night's wind was being
called a typhoon. Eight people had died trying to save their boat and a
Mercedes sports coupe had surfed out of its showroom and down a flooded
river-bed to the beach.
You expect a bit of rain on Madeira as the price of its almost unnatural
greenness. (It is on the same latitude as Saharan Morocco.) Even if the
brochure chose not to mention it, the umbrella stands in every shop are a
giveaway. But this was more than a bit. This was biblical.
We had come to walk the levadas - irrigation channels which contour
Madeira's terraced inland slopes. Easy paths along the channels give
spectacular views and the illusion of taking exercise, we had been told, in
return for minimal effort. But the levadas, too, were blocked or flooded, or
both. Poor old 'Pearl of the Atlantic'.
National service cadets shovelled mud off the seafront. Human chains
baled-out shops. Old men and young women looked on enthralled and rescue
helicopters danced dangerously in the wind. We slithered to the market. The
overnight catch seemed to have been a bumper one. Whole tuna lay on marble
slabs being cut into steaks by brigands with scimitars, which they slid
along the fish until the buyer said 'cut'.
Tuna are handsome, fish-shaped fish, their reputation much harmed by tins.
Espada are not. Long, black, eel-like and ugly, they are nevertheless
Madeira's staple protein, caught close inshore with the help of powerful
lights to attract them. Espada taste of little, which may be why they are
often cooked with local bananas.
Out of the fish-hall, through a separate market full of mangoes, guavas,
passion fruit and custard apples, still it rained. The kind of laden clouds
that race in off the English Channel to test your compass skills on Exmoor
were wrapped round Funchal's upper suburbs.
In the cobbled old town, the Madeira Wine Company was doing rain-proof
tastings. We toured the old wine lodge, breathed its sweet, alcoholic air,
and glugged full glasses, not mere soupcons, of the century's choicest
vintages. Then we repaired through the rain to the deserted but immaculate
English Church.
Madeira is part of a strange archipelago: 150 miles south of the main
island, usefully extending Portugal's territorial waters to within 100 miles
of the Canaries, are the Selvagens - three tiny desert islands where Sir
Ernest Shackleton believed Captain Kidd buried his treasure.
Within sight of Funchal to the south are three more uninhabited lumps and, a
10-minute flight away on the eastern horizon, there is Porto Santo. Joao
Goncalves Zarco arrived there in 1418 after being blown off course while
exploring the West African coast for Prince Henry the Navigator.
Incredibly, he took a year to discover Madeira. It must have been a foggy
year because on a clear day you can see one island from the other. The best
view Zarco had was of a mountain of grey cloud which he thought presaged the
end of the world.
On our way to Funchal airport the taxi-driver had said: 'Porto Santo - good
for one day.' In the circumstances, he was right. Where Madeira is green,
Porto Santo is khaki. Where Madeira rises sheer from the ocean, Porto Santo
tilts out of it like a listing wreck. Where Madeira has a bustling and
lucrative life beyond tourism, Porto Santo just has its beach.
We arrived in a twin-engined Dornier turbo-prop, diving alarmingly towards
the runway that bisects the island. The beach was being pounded by breakers.
Yachts en route to Venezuela from Southampton were battened down in the lee
of the sea wall, lucky to have made it there.
The young bloods of Porto Santo raced their mopeds along the front, leaning
into the cross-wind. We walked to a chapel on a hill with views of pure
Atlantic, then returned to Funchal in the Dornier with the under-16 football
team, which had a Sunday fixture.
A miracle had been performed in our absence. The clouds were gone. The roads
had been cleared. The air was still and warm. Madeira looked like an
emerald. We took a bus over the Camara de Lobos, Europe's highest cliff and
a subject of water-colours by Winston Churchill.
His preferred viewpoint is now a cement works but beyond the cliff, squeezed
into the mouth of a gorge, the town of Ribeira Brava cannot have changed
much since the 1950s. This is the last stop for coffee, petrol and obeisance
(at the 16th century church of Sao Bento) before the grand trans-montane to
the north.
'Grand' is not too grand a word, even though Madeira is no bigger than the
Isle of Man. The road is a miniaturisation of those that climb from the
Amazon into the Andes. The vegetation is as thick and the slopes are as
steep. From the pass, called Encumeada, the ocean is visible north and south
and the path along the levada del norte wriggles away through conifers to
the west.
Coach-loads of day trippers go there but so do serious walkers. You can tell
them by their miners' lamps, which are switched on in the 30 miles of
tunnels the levadas use. (Fearing vampires, we tried scrambling round one
mountain-side instead, and came terrifyingly close to falling off it.)
What they say about Madeira, to attract the young and the young-at-heart, is
true: there is more to it than bridge and tea-dancing and strong, sweet
wine. Just be sure to pack a torch and an umbrella.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Travel: Light fantastic - Why artists colonised a remote
Danish fishing village
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HENDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Skagen is the most northerly tip of Denmark. As you head up through the rich
farmland of Jutland, the country thins out and turns east, tapering to a
windblown sandy finger that points across to Sweden.
The Skagen peninsula separates two fearsome-sounding seas, the Skaggerak in
the North Sea and the Kattegat, the beginnings of the Baltic. Skagen has a
name in English - a somehow threatening word - the Skaw. Certainly the area
was a danger to sailors once: the Skaw has claimed many ships on its sands.
Skagen is no longer threatening and remote, but it was its remoteness 100
years ago that attracted a group of painters. They came to what was a tiny
fishing village in order to escape the stultifying formality of Copenhagen's
salons. Starting in the 1870s, many Nordic painters decamped there each
summer, forming a sort of artists' colony where they would paint and make
merry.
The Skagen painters are known particularly for their treatment of light. Any
visitor to Skagen will discover that the light has a startling clarity and
brightness - a combination of clear sea air and sunlight reflected off the
two seas and vast expanses of sand.
Summer days are long that far north (Skagen is level with Inverness), and
there is a magical moment each evening at about 10pm, called l'heure bleue,
when the light dissolves into a blue haze between night and day.
The most famous picture produced by the Skagen painters is Summer Evening on
the South Beach at Skagen. Two women in long white dresses are walking on
the strand; the folds in the sand are lit by late-evening sunlight and their
dresses appear almost illuminated. Behind them the sea and sky are an
indistinguishable blue. It was painted 100 years ago by P S Kroyer, perhaps
the finest of the Skagen painters.
I went there in November, when there was an un-summerly chill and it was
dark by 5pm. The town of Skagen has expanded - boats no longer put out from
the beach as they do in the paintings, but from a large fishing and ferry
port. The town has spread into small suburbs.
But the cluster of houses of the old town are charming and pretty, with a
very Nordic neatness. Most of the old houses are single-storey, with ochre
walls and orange roof-tiles, their window-frames and eaves picked out in
white. They are couched in tidy gardens behind white picket fences and
nearly all have a flag-pole. On holidays the Danes fly long double-tapered
flags like medieval standards.
Even in November the light is clear and strong. I found that it had a
curious, invigorating effect, bestowing the delicious, if irrational,
feeling of confident expectation that I normally associate with the onset of
spring. I had prepared myself for melancholy; instead there was a spring in
my step. I could see why painters liked Skagen so much.
Kroyer's Summer Evening hangs in the Skagen museum, which tells the story of
the artists through their paintings. The town itself is central to their
work; there are scenes of fishermen launching their boats and scenes of home
life. The artists also painted one another, and Kroyer was a leader in their
Bohemian revelries.
If the artists came to escape Copenhagen society, the salons soon followed
them. The railway arrived in 1890, the smart Copenhageners built their
seaside villas and Skagen became a chic place to be. The Danish royal family
built a summer palace and royal families visited from all over Europe.
The town has lost its Bohemian feel; there are only a few painters now, and
writers and actors tend to live in private villas, but there is a pleasant
seaside feel and a number of attractive old hotels.
The Skagen painters never amounted to a 'school'. Over the 40 years that the
town flourished, they used widely differing styles and techniques. Some were
realist, almost naturalist in their depiction of the fishermen's simple
lives; others were clearly influenced by the impressionists. There are even
snatches of dour Danish formality in imitation of Dutch masters.
Brondums Hotel still holds pride of place in Skagen. There is a pleasant
antique air about the dining room and reception rooms. They are lined with
dark wood panelling and some original paintings still hang on the walls. I
crept in one afternoon to flee the cold and was working my way through a pot
of hot chocolate when three impossibly tall brunettes tripped in, wearing
evening dress and overcoats, as though they had lost their way en route to a
Copenhagen dinner party.
They chatted furtively in a language I did not understand. It all seemed a
little unlikely for 3pm, particularly when one of the girls flashed me a
wicked smile and started to undress.
All was explained a moment later when the stylist came bounding in - they
were models - and started touching-up their outfits, before despatching
them, one by one, into the cold. The light in Skagen is so good, even in
November, that photographers travel there for fashion shoots.
James Henderson flew to Denmark with Maersk Air (London tel: 071-333-0066),
which has twice-daily links from Gatwick to Copenhagen and to Billund in
Jutland.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Travel: Rathlin: an island apart from Ulster - A
bird-watcher's paradise off the north coast of Antrim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER MCCOOEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'It must be like the FA Cup for them,' Tony from Manchester mused as we
watched the model yachts tacking across Ushet Lough.
A laconic furniture remover and keen amateur photographer, Tony was busy
with his filters and lenses as contestants in waders and with long poles
cajoled their boats to out-perform the rest. The prize for the winner was
the Rinever Trophy, named after one of the districts on Rathlin Island.
For the 40 island families, the yacht races - held half-a-dozen times a year
 -are keenly contested. The trophies take pride of place on islanders'
mantelpieces. A triangular course is chosen according to the prevailing
wind. The yachts must reach the shore on the other side of the water,
between two flags; contestants then reset the sails and point them in the
next direction. The race can take from 20 minutes to five hours.
The winning yacht was owned by Dominic McCurdy, who runs Rathlin Island's
only guesthouse. Father MacAteer, the local priest (90 per cent of the
islanders are Roman Catholic), used a megaphone to address the assembled
racers (nine), supporters (15) and visitors (Tony and me). He congratulated
the winner and presented the trophy.
Rathlin is six miles off the north Antrim coast and is Ulster's only
inhabited island, having been so since at least the Neolithic period -
4,000BC to 2,500BC.
In its earliest history, Rathlin must have been comparatively prosperous.
Because of a geological accident, the Neolithic islanders had a thriving
export business. A plug of molten lava forced its way to the surface
millions of years ago and the heat changed, or metamorphosed, the rock
immediately surrounding it.
Known as porcellanite, or recrystallised bauxitic lithomarge, by geologists,
the early farmers, who had given up hunting to till the land, found it just
the job for making axes to cut down trees.
At Brockley, towards the west end of the island, was the axe factory, and
the blades have been found throughout Ireland, in Scotland and Wales and as
far away as north Kent. Along with flint arrow-heads and scrapers made from
nodules taken from the limestone cliffs, axe-heads and blanks are still
quite a common find on the island.
Because it is only 16 miles from the Mull of Kintyre, the Scottish lords of
the isles, the McDonnells, ruled Rathlin for many years. The English
naturally disputed this, and bloody clashes often took place.
But one dispute, in the 17th century, was settled by argument rather than by
the sword. It was claimed that Rathlin was 'a parcel of Ireland (because)
the nature of its soil . . . neither breeds nor nourishes any living thing
venomous'.
The snakeless argument is interesting. Several centuries earlier it was used
to settle a similar dispute over ownership of the Isle of Man. The Normans
introduced venomous reptiles on a trial basis: they lived, and as a matter
of course the island was unanimously judged to belong to England, not
Ireland.
What Churchill referred to as 'the most celebrated spider known to history'
is reputed to have been a Rathlin specimen. Robert the Bruce is supposed to
have sought sanctuary in a cave only accessible by boat, and then only when
the tide is right. The 14th century arachnologist must have had very good
eyesight - and/or a very long candle - as the cave is not only long and
narrow but has a very high ceiling.
Ornithologists are attracted to Rathlin especially in the breeding season.
The smell of guano is all-pervasive as thousands of guillemots, razorbills,
cormorants, shags and species of gull stake out their breeding nooks and
jostle on the narrow ledges each summer.
Other visitors go to study or enjoy rare plants such as the pyramidal bugle,
or swathes of orchids that carpet the unimproved grassland. It is also a
popular place for divers - off Rathlin are some of Britain's deepest waters
and underwater cliffs, as well as numerous wrecks, including HMS Drake,
flagship of the British Navy in the first world war, torpedoed and sunk in
Church Bay.
The activity centre on the island has been designed with divers in mind, but
anyone interested in outdoor activities is welcomed. The building is the
tithe barn of the former owners of the island, the Gage family, who also
used to own the adjacent manor house, which is being converted into a 15-bed
hotel.
The money for these developments has come from various government and
European Union grants, and from the Rathlin Trust, set up in 1987 to arrest
the island's slow economic decline. The trust received a windfall in its
first year. Richard Branson landed in the sea near Rathlin on July 3 1987
after crossing the Atlantic by balloon. Islander Tommy Cecil got a line on
the floundering balloon, the traditional way to carry out salvage at sea.
Instead of claiming the value of the balloon, Tommy asked for a donation to
the trust. A month later Branson returned (by helicopter) and presented a
cheque for Pounds 25,000.
In 1992, electricity came to Rathlin - provided by wind turbines on the hill
overlooking Church Bay. The grand switch-on was attended by the Reverend Ian
Paisley, the local MP. When it was his turn to say a few words, he began:
'The Lord said: 'Let there be light' . . . but it sure took a long time to
come to Rathlin.'
Weather permitting, there are daily sailings leaving Ballycastle on the
north Antrim coast at 10.30am and Rathlin at 4pm; passengers only, no cars,
Pounds 3.15 one way. Accommodation: The Manor House (hotel), details from
the Rathlin Island Trust, tel: 02657-63920. The Guest House (B&amp;B): Mr and
Mrs McCurdy, tel: 02657-63917. The Richard Branson Activity Centre (hostel),
tel: 02657-63915. There is a free camping site at Church Bay harbour.

FT  12 MAR 94 / How To Spend It: Take two kitchens and stir very carefully -
If you can't stand the heat . . . delegate when decision-making in the home.
Lucia van der Post on two radical examples of refurbishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For those who own old and beautiful houses the challenge of respecting the
antiquity, tradition and fabric of the building, while acquiring a few
modern comforts and technology is sometimes overwhelming.
Nowhere is the potential contradiction between old and new-fangled worlds
more difficult to resolve than in the kitchen.
Notions of the ideal kitchen vary and the skilled kitchen refurbisher can
dabble in them all, from sleek city slicker to rural rustic dream, from
pastel Provencal to a touch of tribal primitive. Kitchens are often the
repository of romantic dreams.
Even in this day and age, when the cooking of Lady Sieff (aka Marks &amp;
Spencer) is in such hot demand, and when many a family relies on what in
America are known as 'food contacts', instead of roasts and proper puddings,
the kitchen is still seen as the centre of family life.
Yuppies, who rush home merely to lay down their heads before ordering a
take-away, lovingly plan replicas of Tuscan kitchens. In urban loft-houses,
those who have only come upon bruschetta on a restaurant menu, happily order
wooden counter-tops.
But the one thing that they all have in common is that the romantic dream
has to be reconciled with technical requirements. Even the most rustic of
modern kitchens needs a cooker, a fridge, a freezer, plugs for kettles and
toasters, work surfaces that are easy to clean and storage space. For
others, espresso machines, juicers and microwaves are also essential.
The Douglas Stephen Partnership, of The Annex, 140-142 St John Street,
London EC1V 4JT (tel: 071-336-7884) was recently asked to provide a kitchen
for a grand Jacobean house in Suffolk. The house is lovely, a Grade I listed
building, and structural changes have to be approved by English Heritage and
the local planning authority. In the event, very little of the main
structure was altered - one doorway was moved slightly.
The architects decided that there was no point in trying to be slavishly
faithful to the period - an impossibility as the Jacobean kitchen is so
different to our own - or to recreate too olde worlde a country-house
kitchen. Instead, they tackled the problem by imbuing the overall design
with an air of solidity and grandeur.
The kitchen had not been touched for years and needed to be completely
gutted. The house is lived in by a family with three young children and the
brief was to provide a very useful, fully-equipped area for family use that
matched the mood of the house.
There were two main constraints - one was that the family had a vast
American Amana fridge/freezer, which could not be hidden behind wooden
cupboards. This led to the decision to keep most of the rest of the
equipment visible as a counterbalance to the fridge. A black Aga was already
positioned across one corner and this was flanked by two smaller cabinets,
leaving the centre of the room open for the kitchen table. The owner was
insistent on a square-edge, straight-sided Belfast sink.
The kitchen had several low windows which meant it was impractical to put in
rows of cabinets. No-one liked the notion of a gleaming modern 'Euro'
kitchen so, free-standing units, new versions of the traditional dressers
and side-boards, were combined with some fitted cabinets.
The kitchen is a tall room and the height was broken by using the client's
collection of pottery around the room. A glass shelf was used for the
collection to give the impression of a frieze and the lights help to give
the idea that the glass floats above the cabinets.
Lots of storage space was sought and, as you can see from one of the
photographs below, at least one of the doors has storage on the inside.
The kitchen had to be replastered and repainted. A yellow-ochre lime-wash
was used on the walls. The floor had to be redone. Large, terracotta tiles
from China - each looks hand-made and slightly uneven  - were used so the
effect is of great age. With the use of low-voltage lights and the splendid
collection of ceramic pots the entire kitchen looks as if has been there for
years.
Simon Stocker of Stocker Furniture, 191-197 Archway Road, London N6 5BN
(081-341-7322) was responsible for all the timber work and the glass
shelves. He used limed oak for the casing, dressers and sideboards, and
chunky oiled teak for the worktops, which gives an air of great solidity.
The handles on the cabinet doors have a resolutely industrial air - made
from sleek, polished stainless steel they come from Elementa, the
architectural ironmongers.
As Simon Stocker puts it: 'The whole is a very successful blend of modern
design using glass and polished stainless steel with a respectful
genuflexion to the past with the use of limed oak for the cabinets and a
generous three inches of teak for the work tops.
'It was a joy to make and I love it.'
This kind of kitchen, of course, does not come cheap. All the cabinet work
was specially made and Simon Stocker's work alone came to about Pounds
19,000.
Then, of course, there was the replastering, the repainting, the flooring
and the cost of the very expensive, state-of-the art equipment.
Not all the costs can be separated out - the builders were also restoring
the rest of the house - but around Pounds 40,000 would probably be near the
ultimate cost.

FT  12 MAR 94 / How To Spend It: Kindred kitchen spirit - If you can't stand
the heat . . . delegate when decision-making in the home. Lucia van der Post
on two radical examples of refurbishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Anthony Worrall Thompson, the chef behind those chic London eateries, dell'
Ugo and 190 Queensgate, asked Mark Wilkinson to update the kitchen in his
own house, an Edwardian cottage near the Thames in Oxfordshire.
Wilkinson is not only a provider of made-to-measure kitchens, but does most
of the cooking for his family. Therefore Worrall Thompson felt he might find
a kindred spirit who would understand his needs.
The inspiration for the kitchen came from a little house which was built for
Queen Victoria's children at Osborne on the Isle of Wight. He felt the
cottage inspired him to think of Edwardian shooting lodges, cellar kitchens
in Edwardian London, Elgar, the Malvern Hills and a host of other
traditional English images. From these images he designed a kitchen which
had the feel of an old kitchen in a country house, but was not strictly
traditional.
'As a professional chef,' says Wilkinson, 'I knew he was going to be very
demanding on the kitchen physically, lots of bashing and kneading, so I had
to give him something strong and unfussy.
'As the front door opens straight into the kitchen it is clearly the most
important and emphatic room in the house, more important than the
sitting-room, so it was vital that it was welcoming and attractive as well
as functional. We put a heavy working area around the sinks and appliances
down one side and the large-scale storage down the other.'
Catering-sized equipment - as with Simon Stocker's clients, Worrall Thompson
insisted on a giant Amana fridge/freezer and a Belfast sink and taps - had
to be housed, so plain sturdy doors and stainless steel working surfaces
were a solid balance for their bulk. The cupboards all look sturdy and solid
and have handsome curved ends. Adjoining and leading into the kitchen is the
dining area. From there the living room opens up. The whole feel is of a
well-loved, much lived-in room.
The range of cabinets, finished in eggshell cream and with heavy rosewood
handles, is from Mark Wilkinson's latest range, which he calls Cooks'
Kitchen. Having offered us more elaborate decorative options in the past,
ranging from 'A Taste of Provence' to the 'Santa Fe' look and any number of
painted finishes, Mark Wilkinson now felt in need of a simpler approach to
kitchen design.
Cooks' Kitchen has the solid feel of an old-fashioned Edwardian house, a
kitchen in a real country house. Its working kitchen atmosphere is
reinforced by the surfaces - some made from extra-thick maple, some from
stainless steel and a granite inset in Giallo Veneziano.
The floor is made of wide, stripped pine floorboards. On one wall,
reinforcing Wilkinson's imagery from Albion England, are some decorative
murals of English rural life (workers in the fields, by Samantha Allkins),
which are meant to convey the feeling of exuberance and joy in the
countryside.
On the other wall are some primitive animal paintings, as well as some
peppers and tomatoes, as perhaps befits a prime purveyor of Mediterranean
peasant dishes.
All Mark Wilkinson's kitchens are made-to-measure. This one cost about
Pounds 19,000, including the Amana Fridge/freezer but excluding the French
Morice cooker.
Mark Wilkinson has showrooms at: 126 Holland Park Avenue, London W11 (tel:
071-727 5814); 13 Holywell Hill, St Albans, Herts AL1 1EZ (0727-40975); and
a new one at 41 St John's Wood High Street, London NW8. His headquarters are
at Overton House, High Street, Bromham, Wilts SN15 2HA. (0380-850004).

FT  12 MAR 94 / Fashion (The Global Wardrobe - At a Wedding): The bride

One of the ironies of French life is that for a country in which adultery is
virtually a national institution, the ritual of the wedding ceremony is
taken very, very seriously.
The smartest French weddings take place in the old country homes of the
bride's family. Yet every Saturday, the streets of Paris are filled with
honking horns as drivers 'salute' the bridal cars - with white ribbons tied
around the radio aerials - on their way to the local mairie or church.
The men at society weddings are still kitted out in morning suits. But
French morning suits, unlike the British version, are expected to be in mint
condition and French men are fond of ensuring that all the male guests sport
matching ties and buttonholes.
Parisians also like to liven up their lounge suits on less formal occasions
with elaborate waistcoats. Hermes' intricately printed silk waistcoats, with
co-ordinating ties and handkerchieves, are popular as are Koji Tatsuno's
woven silk waistcoats and Yohji Yamamoto's embroidered suits.
The female guests are expected to be visions of chic. The outfit itself is
often kept as simple as possible so that it can be topped off with a really
resplendent hat: the bigger the brim the better. Snappy little
pastel-coloured Chanel suits are popular - or long, flowing frocks for more
bohemian weddings.
The high-society bride herself will almost certainly wear a dress made for
the day by her favourite designer. And no truly chic Parisian wedding would
be complete without the designer in attendance to preen for the
photographers and fuss over the frock.
One model who got married in Paris this summer appointed John Galliano in
the dual role of dress designer and chief attendant. He rose to the occasion
by donning a rakish hat and orchid buttonhole to whisk her train along the
aisle.

The wedding reception is a grand affair in Japan and one of the very few
occasions that calls for serious dressing up.
The Japanese take it for granted that looking elegant for a wedding
celebration is a must, regardless of cost.
The bride's family will typically spend at least Y100,000 (Pounds 635) on
hiring a traditional bride's kimono, if they do not own one, and guests will
also readily hire formal outfits.
To keep up with the bride, who will change from a traditional kimono to a
western style wedding dress and then a formal gown, women guests favour
glamorous gowns that are only tolerated for the most formal of events.
There is a difference, however, in rules for married and single women.
Although not necessarily strictly adhered to, it is generally expected that
young, single women will wear a rented ballgown or a silk kimono,
beautifully embroidered in gold, vermillion, purple and other bright colours
and featuring various nature motifs. These long-sleeved kimonos are called
furisode.
Western-style gowns will feature costly materials of all hues, beads,
spangles, or lace and will often be worn in the winter with ostrich
mufflers, long gloves and all.
Married women tend not to wear full gowns and generally opt for something
more subdued. And in the case of kimonos, there is a strict code that
married women do not wear furisode. Instead, they wear a black kimono
embroidered in gold with the family crest visibly presented.
Jewellery is always in abundance among the women, married or not, and pearls
are favoured this year.
As for the men, weddings do not provide the same opportunities for dressing
up: morning coats were the rule, and still are on the whole, although
younger men are experimenting with stylish tuxedos.
The problem with tuxedos however, is that since the only people who wear
them outside wedding receptions are usually waiters, it is not difficult to
be mistaken for one.

Ken and Barbie time comes round again sooner than you can say 'chiffon'. The
Frankfurt wedding season, heavily concentrated as elsewhere in the
springtime, provides opportunities for all involved to dress up in a fashion
which reflects the diverse influences at play in an essentially central
European city where almost 30 per cent of the population is foreign.
Even among the natives, the bride and groom will almost inevitably be clad
in extravagantly 'romantic' styles, some of which appear better suited to a
variety show stage than to a church aisle. The bridal basics are much as
elsewhere: white frock and veil.
But the devilry is in the detail. Expense is no object, and, in many cases,
nor is 'good taste'. The simplest dress is often laden with supernumerary
decorations. Any portion of the bodice or skirt - hipline, topside, backside
 -which can support a silken swag or a bundle of artificial pearls or
flowers is decorated accordingly.
The complete Barbie look may be achieved during a lengthy colouring and
contouring session in one of the city's hundreds of beauty parlours.
The groom, who elsewhere might be expected to shrink into a suit, the better
to enhance his partner's appearance, is more likely to dress to compete. A
shiny suit with a cut-off double-breasted jacket, winged collar, coloured
bow tie and black patent shoes would be extravagant enough.
But your man-about-to-wed will rarely stop there. As an extension of his
persona, his car will also come in for the treatment. My local florist has a
nice little seasonal earner in dressing up soft-tops. The car will emerge
with the cockpit completely ringed with appropriate blooms, and an
arrangement better suited to a dinner table strapped across the bonnet.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Fashion (The Global Wardrobe - At a Wedding): The bride

</HEADLINE>

The best thing about American weddings is that they can be held anywhere.
Forget boring old churches and town halls. In the States you can tie the
knot in museums, night clubs or back gardens, atop roof terraces, in
warehouse lofts or on beaches. This is not only a lot of fun, but for guests
it means you can be more adventurous when it comes to choosing what to wear.
That's the good news. The bad news, however, is that the traditional
white-wedding-with-frills has made a comeback across most of America, and on
many occasions guests are expected to turn up in traditional wedding gear.
For women, that means bright cocktail dresses in summer, or more
sophisticated evening wear for winter ceremonies. For men, it usually means
dark, bland suits with a white shirt and tie. Or, if it is a very formal
affair, tuxedos with white or black bow ties, this being one of the ugliest
of American traditions.
Fortunately, New Yorkers like to think of themselves as a different breed
from the rest of the country, so attending weddings in and around the
metropolis gives the guest a little more room to work with.
Women can wear sexier, funkier clothes - baggy men's suits remain popular
among the arty set - and in true New York style, female guests rarely bother
with the rule about not upstaging the bride.
Men, meanwhile, are allowed a dash of style or colour, whether it be in
their suits, shirts, ties or shoes, or in a combination of all four.
Waistcoats, or 'vests' as they are known here, are a particularly
fashionable way of expressing individualism at a wedding without upsetting
the bride's parents too much.
For the truly bizarre, however, nothing beats the recent wedding in a
Manhattan loft apartment. Because it was Halloween, surreal fancy dress was
the order of the day, with the lovely couple dressed as matching giant bugs.
The star of the show, however, was the female guest who turned up dressed as
 -guess what - a bride.

The wedding, part formal religious rite, part informal affectionate
celebration, can cause the guest as many headaches as it does the bride.
What to wear was once simply answered: one wore one's Sunday best with a new
hat and a corsage of symbolic flowers. Only the immediate wedding party
deemed the enterprise needful of new clothes and those, until this century,
tended to be practical, wear-again choices.
Over the years, the celebration or reception (once a simple wedding
breakfast for the family and immediate friends) has become longer and more
important than the ceremony, particularly a civil ceremony. At the same
time, the romantically archaic element has been highlighted.
It was once standard practice for men to wear the morning dress of a late
Victorian gentleman and for the women to choose gowns that had nothing to do
with current fashion but much to do with fairy tale illustrations and
Victorian Christmas cards.
Today, the level of formality of dress tends to be indicated on the
invitation with a curt instruction to the men. Women are left to
extrapolate. What is appropriate next to morning dress? What is suitable
adjacent to a tuxedo? What looks right on the arm of a lounge suit?
Possessors of wardrobes full of elegant, flattering clothing go
panic-shopping, opting in confusion for the brightest and most formal
daytime ensemble they can find on the rails - an unhappy compromise between
fancy dress and real life.
The results are obsessively, often shrilly, colour-coordinated, overly
trimmed and fussily detailed, frequently in fabrics inappropriate for the
weather - outfits, in fact, the like of which are seen at Royal Ascot and
nowhere else.
And just as at Ascot, the hats veer towards the fantastical: in the
millinery department they looked witty, jaunty, celebratory; en masse,
surrounded by their peers, they look strange, their wearers slightly
deranged.
Just as troublesome is the relaxed register office wedding for which no
particular form of dress is specified.
Usually the bride's mother has refused to miss her moment and has shrugged
into many matching layers of tulle and chiffon, while half the guests could
be on their way to Tesco. The other half have dressed for a job interview.
Everyone hits the champagne feeling anxiously under or over-dressed and the
pictures are an embarrassed mess.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Food and Drink: Let's hear it for older generations - Wine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wines, like policemen, seem to be younger these days. But at least there are
more of the former, and at prices so temptingly cheap that 85 per cent of
bottles sold in the UK cost less than Pounds 3.50.
A wine costing Pounds 10 and above looks decidedly more expensive than it
did, even taking inflation into account. This raises the question: is it
worth buying wines that require time - sometimes a long time - to develop
their special qualities.
This question currently occupies the minds of growers, especially in France,
which produces some of the best wines but relies on a global market. Are
they worth their prices and time - Bordeaux's classed and peer growths, the
red and white grand and premier crus of burgundies, the richer Rhones and
Alsace.
The answer must be subjective, for such fine wines can no more be judged
objectively - on the basis of what the French call qualite prix and the
British value for money - than can a delicious but expensive restaurant meal
or the cost of fashionable clothes. It is mainly a matter of resources - and
how best to spend those available.
Yet, there is a strong case for acquiring fine wines. They have individual
characteristics, seductive bouquets and distinctive flavours, dry or sweet.
There is great variety, and they provide agreeable opportunities for
comparison that can transform a meal.
The cost range is wide, and it is not necessary to pay huge prices to enjoy
them. They call for companions to share them, discuss and even argue about
them. To open such wines on your own is a sad waste.
En primeur and 'futures' marketing has been suspended, at least temporarily,
particularly for clarets, and this is no bad thing. Partly because of
inflation and recession, but also because of misjudgment of a volatile
market, about the only recent claret vintage that could be re-sold
profitably - and that only with careful timing - was 1982.
But these upper-class wines must be bought early for keeping, including the
finer white burgundies and Moselles and Rhines. Times are past when top
growers and merchants could afford to hold stock over many years. Interest
rates are now too high, and capital available must be employed for the next
vintage to be bought.
There is a good case for buying such wines as soon as they are available in
bottle from your preferred retail merchant, which has made its own
selection, at various price levels. If possible, they should be marketed in
six-bottle lots as well as cases.
Of course, older vintages may be bought at auction; but although the
salerooms do their best to ensure the wines offered are in good condition,
you cannot always be sure. Moreover, the particular wines you want may not
be all that easy to come by - indeed, if German or Alsace, almost
impossible.
There are those who ask why, with modern techniques, development of these
fine wines cannot be speeded up. Do we have to wait up to 10 years before
opening a classed- growth claret, and not much less for a superior red
burgundy? The answers mostly are no and yes respectively. Most wines, even
the lesser varieties, are drunk too young. That goes for good champagne too.
One impediment to keeping wine over a period is lack of suitable domestic
accommodation. It should be held in dark, vibration-free conditions with
equable temperatures. Generally, the risk is heat rather than cold, which at
worst may slightly delay maturation. However, most private merchants, who
sell the kinds of wines discussed here, provide temperature-controlled
reserves, currently at a rent of about Pounds 4 to Pounds 5 a year,
including VAT. But, as Jancis Robinson pointed out in a recent article,
guaranteed individual identification must be assured.
Those who take special pleasure in drinking fine, probably at least
relatively expensive, wines - though quality does not always go with price -
may be accused of wine-snobbery. No doubt this exists, but for most
enthusiasts it is a collecting hobby, and one to be shared with others.
Wine drinking like this is an innocent pleasure. The best ratio of drinkers
per bottle, in my view, is four, and the maximum six, for enough should be
available for glasses to be refreshed. Often a wine may develop in the
glass.
Provided that there are no post-prandial car drivers present, such rationing
at a leisurely meal may allow three or four different wines, properly of
ascending quality and age, from the same region, to find their way on to the
table.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Food and Drink: Hey, hey listen to the band - Nicholas
Lander feeds on music during a short visit to Cuba
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 45-minute journey along the road east of Havana brings you to the
struggling oil wells that litter this coast. It also brings you to one of
the most enjoyable restaurants in Cuba.
It is called El C--a-el.
It is not a desire to conceal professional secrets which prevents me
revealing its full name. It is more simple than that: the missing letters
have fallen off and, like so much else in Cuba, cannot be replaced because
of lack of cash.
Business in these restaurants is not too good for the same reason. When we
lunched there one weekday, only one other table was occupied in a room that
could seat 70.
Nevertheless, a seven-piece Cuban band was warming up and they greeted us
with huge smiles and waves. The waitress, also delighted to see us, handed
over a large red menu, in Spanish and English, with about 30 items on it.
No sooner had we sat down and chosen our fare than the waitress said that,
unfortunately, there was no gas for the kitchen stoves and all the cooked
items were off. Would we like a sandwich instead? We had no option - even
though we already knew that the range of sandwiches on offer in Cuba is
limited to ham and cheese or cheese and ham.
The band comprised three guitars, a double bass, bongo drums, maracas,
andolave and a singer who announced 'traditional Cuban song' before each
number.
They played with all their heart and soul and within minutes I had forgotten
the unpleasant smell of oil from the wells on the shore, the cloudy weather
and that I was eating another ham and cheese sandwich. Suddenly, I started
enjoying the meal.
In Cuba live music is not just an integral part of every meal but also
almost the best value on any menu. We gave the band members Dollars 20
(Pounds 13.50) and they went away even happier. Our 12 sandwiches and beers
cost twice that. And however tough the sandwiches, they were certainly more
enjoyable than any meal in the restaurants of hotels such as the Nacional in
Havana or the Melia in Varadero, where so little respect is paid to Cuban
culinary tradition that you could close your eyes and imagine you were in
any hotel anywhere in the world.
Invariably, the two best items on offer are Cuban ice-cream and papaya. The
fruit has been crossed with the Spanish 'mamey', a tree that takes 17 years
to produce its first crop. It is deep red, slightly putrid, but wonderful.
An indication of how disappointing hotel restaurants are came last year
when, as the Cuban economy was being opened up to private enterprise, many
Cubans turned their houses into restaurants and began to entertain fellow
citizens and tourists to delicious home-cooked meals in return for US
dollars.
These enterprises, known as paladares, became instantly popular, with one
man reputedly clearing more than Dollars 1,000 a week. The hotels
retaliated, unfortunately not by raising standards, but by complaining to
the government which, sadly, closed larger premises.
Like so many other tourists, I went initially to La Bodeguita del Medio in
old Havana for a mojito, just one of the drinks Ernest Hemingway made famous
while living in a nearby hotel. The ingredients are ice, sugar, lime,
three-year-old white rum, mint leaves and soda water.
The restaurant behind the bar served Cuban food at tourist prices. The
traditional moros y cristianos (Moors and Christians - white rice and black
beans), roast pork and black bean soup was served along with the most
innovative dish, deep fried sweet potato. Dinner was Dollars 40 for two -
not including the music. At 9.30pm two guitarists swept in and sang as
though we were a room of impresarios.
For a final mojito in old Havana I went to sit on the terrace of El Patio
looking on to the faded grandeur of Havana's cathedral. The sky was blue,
the wind blowing in off the sea and, naturally, a four-piece band was
playing.
Until they heard the competition, that is. Across the small square another
band had set up and, with the aid of amplifiers, filled the square with
music. Discretion overcame pride and the four musicians I had noticed
earlier had put down their instruments and were standing in the audience.
Cuba may not thrill gastronomically, but it does provide the most exciting
music I have ever eaten to.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Food and Drink: Playing truant in Venice - Giles MacDonogh
receives magisterial tuition at the Gritti Palace hotel / Cookery Courses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In my experience cookery schools fall into two categories: the magisterial
and the experimental. In the magisterial school you listen and take notes;
in the experimental you prepare dishes under the supervision of a chef.
To some extent the form the course takes appears to be dictated by the
dominant pedagogical ideas of the country in question; so it is that France
and Italy are magisterial because that is how their schools work, while in
northern Europe there is a tendency to let pupils discover things for
themselves.
The best courses combine the two systems. Personally I prefer more weight to
be given to the experimental side.
I also like the teaching to be based on instilling principles rather than
individual recipes. If a course succeeds only in teaching a clutch of
recipes it is a little like trying to learn a language from a phrase-book.
What a cook requires is a structural foundation which can be adapted to a
wider spectrum of uses.
The cookery school at the Gritti Palace hotel, in Venice, has been going for
the best part of two decades now. The courses take up five weeks of the
year, and each of these examines a particular theme: the Veneto region;
fresh herbs; Mediterranean cooking; autumnal cooking; and cooking for
special occasions.
The classes take place in the Gritti Palace, a former ducal residence which
has been the city's most luxurious hotel for a century or so.
The courses, taught by the Gritti's Friuli-born chef, Celestino Giacomello,
are in the purest magisterial school. A maximum of 20 pupils gather in front
of the chef and his assistant while he cooks. About half the pupils were
Italians, for the rest a simultaneous translation was given in American
English.
On my course last year all the pupils were serious, grown-up people with a
confirmed passion for food.
They included a German 'hobby cook'; a Hungarian woman married to an
American and living in Padua; a Japanese would-be pastry-chef; the wife of a
New York food broker; an elderly Russian aristocrat who lived nearby on the
Grand Canal; the above-mentioned Italians; and a clutch of Swedes, including
an eminent doctor-cum-biochemist whose insight into the biochemical and
nutritional aspects of what we were eating was a course in itself.
Our theme was herbs, or as our interpreter would say: 'urbs'.
In the course of the week we learned recipes involving chervil, wild celery,
citron (which is really a fruit), red and green chives, tarragon, oregano,
dill coriander (which Giacomello thought an aphrodisiac) rhubarb (the juice
of which was blended with parmigiano reggiano cheese to make a crust for
gnocchi) root and leaves of horseradish, majoram (Giacomello: the queen of
herbs), nettles (which the chef used to make a rich veloute, a world away
from the soup beloved of Irish peasants), mint, artichoke stems, hyssop,
melissa and fresh angelica leaves.
Every day for five days the chef prepared a three-course meal with a side
dish. This was served up as our lunch.
In the afternoon further courses examined the growing of herbs; table arts
and Venetian glass; flower arranging; and a tour of 'unknown' Venice.
I played truant after lunch, preferring to pound the marble pavements on my
own. It seemed to me that the afternoon classes would be better arranged at
6pm, when the lovely light had begun to fade.
I was disappointed that we did not have a chance to practise any of these
recipes. The one opportunity for audience participation came with the
forming of the potato gnocchi, for those who had been seduced by the,
frankly, American concept of the Mediterranean diet.
Giacomello's cooking used too much cream, butter and sugar. This worried me
less: only the poorest parts of Italy eat the Mediterranean diet, and only
the poorest people in them.
The rich citizens of Puglia cram as much butter, cream and sugar into their
gullets as they can.
I was sadder that the cooking was not sufficiently Venetian, but one of the
courses at least, does provide an introduction to the local food.
There was one important positive factor which should not be understated: the
chance to stay in an enchanting hotel in the most beautiful city in Europe.
The week long course at the Gritti Palace Hotel costs L600,000 (Pounds 240)
per person. Participants may stay in the hotel for five nights for L1.025m
per person for a double room, and L1.5m for a single. Tel: 010 39 41 79 46

FT  12 MAR 94 / Cookery: Cakes to bake for mother
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tomorrow is Mothering Sunday, and Easter and spring weddings are nearly upon
us. All are occasions for celebrating with sweetmeats and cakes.
Mothering Sunday used to be a day on which devout people made a pilgrimage
to their mother church. Later, it became the day to visit and honour your
birth mother. Either event may be marked by baking a simnel cake.
This is one of the richest cakes of the calendar year, especially when made
with lots of whole almonds blanched and pounded to a paste with eggs and
sugar, and perhaps a splash of saffron or orange flower water to flavour it.
A circular slab of this mixture (marchpane or marzipan) is sandwiched in the
middle of the cake. The rest is re-rolled and used to cloak the cake and to
stud the rim with a ring of little balls said to represent the apostles.
Wedding cakes are the richest and most elaborate of all, iced fancifully and
tiered like edible Albert memorials. The crumb of a wedding cake is dense
and dark, more fruit than flour, held fast by a double layer of wrapping:
marzipan first, then an outer casing of cement-hard icing.
These cakes seem designed to endure as long as marriage itself. They should
be robust enough to travel the length and breadth of Britain unharmed - even
when sliced and boxed and consigned into the hands of the post office.
My tastes - and baking ability - do not stretch that far. I incline towards
simpler, plainer offerings:
FENNEL SEED CAKE
Ingredients: 6oz unbleached white household flour; scant 1 teaspoon baking
powder; 2oz flaked almonds; 1 1/2 -2 teaspoons fennel seed, bruised with
pestle and mortar; the finely-grated zest of an orange; 6oz unsalted butter,
cut into dice; 4oz caster sugar; 2 size 3 eggs, broken up with a fork and
mixed with 2 tablespoons milk.
Method: Grind the almonds in a food processor or spice mill (the results
will taste much more almondy than ready-ground almonds sold in a packet).
Sift the flour twice with the baking powder, then stir in the citrus zest,
fennel and almonds.
Cream the butter and sugar in a food processor. Beat in the eggs gradually,
adding a little of the flour if there is any hint of curdling. Take the
mixture out of the machine and fold in the (rest of the) flour by hand.
Spoon the mixture into a 1 1/2 pt loaf tin that has been buttered, lined and
buttered again. Make a dip in the centre and bake at 350`F/180`C (gas mark
4) for 45 minutes, then at 335`F/170`C (gas mark 3 1/2 ) for 30 minutes.
Cover the tin with a sheet of greaseproof paper if the cake begins to brown
too much.
LIME &amp; COCONUT MUFFINS (makes 6)
Ingredients: 1 1/2 oz dessicated coconut; the finely-grated zest of a lime;
1 tablespoon of freshly-squeezed lime juice; 1 heaped tablespoon of polenta
flour, plus enough unbleached white household flour to make 4oz in total; a
scant 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder; a pinch of salt; 1 1/2 oz caster sugar;
1 egg broken up with a fork and mixed with 3 fl oz milk; 1 1/2 oz butter.
Method: Sift together and mix the flours lightly, baking powder, salt and
sugar. Barely melt the butter. Away from the heat, quickly stir in the lime
juice, zest and coconut (in that order), followed by the beaten egg with
milk.
Tip the contents of the pan on to the dry ingredients and fold together
lightly. Spoon the mixture into six deep muffin tins lined with fluted paper
cases and bake for about 20 minutes at 400`F/200`C (gas mark 6).
Those who prefer to avoid baking of any sort may like to consider a
Mothering Sunday outing instead. This year, nearly two dozen National Trust
properties are opening specifically for the occasion and are offering
special Mother's Day lunches and/or teas. For details, ring 071-227 4802.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Food and Drink: FT winners - Appetisers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On Monday, the computer at Transmedia's office selected at random the names
of 1,000 FT readers who had used their FT/Transmedia card during our
restaurant promotion and credited them each with Pounds 50. Letters are
going to all the lucky winners.
Transmedia has now advanced Pounds 1.3m to 270 restaurants in England,
Scotland and Wales. Since the card was launched in January, Transmedia has
passed on more than Pounds 100,000 in savings to FT readers.
The speed with which the card has taken off in the UK impressed even Mel
Chasen, Transmedia's founder, during a visit to London. What has impressed
is how quickly British restaurateurs have taken advantage of Transmedia's
cash resources to improve their facilities.
With Transmedia's assistance, restaurateurs have: financed extensions;
opened one new restaurant; bought espresso machines; taken delivery of
larger-than-usual wine orders to enjoy bigger discounts; paid for new
furniture; refurbished; and, in two cases, bought a water purification and
bottling system which turns tap water into the restaurant's own bottled
mineral water.
The star attraction in Christie's sale of fine wines on Thursday, which
realised more than Pounds 211,000, was dame jeanne of Chateau Petrus 1945.
Christie's, which had never before sold a dame jeanne, assumed the role of
Archimedes. By immersing the bottle in water, inside a sealed bag, it
established its volume as 3.87 litres, slightly more than five normal
bottles.
From a vintage considered by many to be the greatest of the century, the
bottle fetched Pounds 12,100, including buyer's premium, and went to a
European collector.
The sale was significant in that it came only a week after Hong Kong
announced an increase in excise tax on wine from 21 to 90 per cent.
For the past three years, Hong Kong buyers have dominated the fine wine
market for red bordeaux, particularly for the best vintages from 1961 to
1982. Unless the tax rise is modified, implications for the London wine
trade may be severe.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Arts: Murder most entertaining - Tragedy and trivia /
Manchester, City of Drama
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This year, as you may have heard, Manchester is City of Drama - but why?
Certainly, 1994 is importing into Manchester a mass of high-profile national
and international theatre: Peter Brook's latest offering, Howard Barker's
new play (reviewed here by Paul Driver). Theatre de Complicite's staging of
The Three Lives of Lucie Cabrol had its premiere here in January and the
Ninagawa Peer Gynt comes to Manchester next week. But what kind of a city of
drama will Manchester be in 1995?
The city's most high-profile theatre is the Royal Exchange. Its present
production is Venice Preserved, Otway's 1681 tragedy. One feature made my
visit worthwhile - the passionate sincerity with which wonderful young Helen
McCrory plays the heroine Belvidera. The play is full of such high-flown
emotionalism that I had imagined that only a grand, stylised form of acting
could bring it off; but McCrory's extraordinary naturalism has changed my
mind.
The rest of the staging - directed Gregory Hersov - is both phoney and
tepid. Jonathan Cullen, who plays Jaffeir, is a curious case. He has shown a
remarkable edge in several modern roles, but recently he has forsaken that,
concentrating on classic roles which he plays with a strange mix of
obviously faked intensity and wimpish sensitivity. To one line in ten he
brings simple eloquence; to the next nine an unconvincing striving for
'musical' effects and febrile contrivance. Meanwhile his accent keeps
wandering between Leeds and Oxford.
A certain actorliness may do very well for Venice Preserved, but George
Anton's Pierre (spoken with a Scots accent) is artificially conceived, and
spoken with a chilling display of vocal tricks. As for David Gant's Priuli,
I have not heard such a canting piece of hamming since - oh - Cheryl
Campbell's Lady Macbeth. And she at least was brisk, whereas he intones
every line like a requiem for a dead archbishop.
Hersov and his designer have set the play in Victorian dress, and the
leading characters in drab colours. Even McCrory, who looked so captivating
in the crinolines of Trelawny, is cramped here by stiff, dull, concealing
costumes. Still, she is the one lamp amid the gloom, a constant ray of vital
energy. And the sheer spontaneity with which she ascends the high climaxes
of delusion in her final speeches is astonishing.
'Intrigue and passion in a perfumed oasis]' Thus the subtitle to Deborah's
Daughter, a brand new play by Pam Gems being given in Manchester's smaller
Library Theatre. There is a lot of Gems about right now: Piaf back in the
West End, Queen Christina at the Bristol Old Vic, Dusa, Fish, Stas and Vi
coming up at the Etcetera soon, and now this.
The action concerns a rich oil widow, Deborah Pedersen, her mother, Lady
Wiggins, and her teenage daughter Stephanie: all three in an unnamed Gulf
state, guests of Colonel Hassan Sa'id Ibn Said. Deborah - an important
research scientist until she married - has come to hand over a philanthropic
cheque for Dollars 20m to help the state through a drought. The Colonel,
however, may use it for military purposes. He manages at the same time (a)
to start to attempt seducing her (b) to launch a coup d'etat. Meanwhile he
may or may not be commencing an affair with her daughter. And . . . But do
you want to hear any more of this?
Deborah's Daughter is the most maladroit piece of playwriting I have seen in
a long while. Gems suspends both character consistency and the plot
regularly, simply to pursue cheap effects of suspense or surprise.
Half the time it is impossible to believe that Deborah is an intelligent
woman who takes responsibility for affairs, because she keeps dithering and
fretting hysterically; the other half she suddenly becomes cool and
self-possessed. This inner conflict might be interesting if Gems was
interested in making it so; but no, she just likes surprising us with
Deborah's changes of mind and tone.
Sue Dunderdale, directing, has tried to make the play more seamless than it
is. Anna Carteret does much to make the complex but nebulous Deborah come to
life, and it is good to see her playing so vulnerable a role. But she paces
her main speeches weakly, and overdoes the loud outbursts.
The role of Stephanie's boyfriend David is played by an appealingly
sensitive, willowy, young man (Philip Darling) when the words and action
make it plain he should be an insensitive, blundering, hunky young toff.
Jane Freeman over-coarsens the already indelicate Lady Wiggins. As Hassan,
Raad Rawi has to cope with lines like 'And your hair] The colour of pale
fire at night under the desert . . . '

FT  12 MAR 94 / Arts: Hated Nightfall - Paul Driver enjoys Howard Barker's
'theatre of catastrophe' / Manchester, City of Drama
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL DRIVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Dancehouse Theatre is Manchester's latest performance space, providing
this City of Drama with a much-needed middle-sized theatre.
To launch the Oxford Road venue, the Wrestling School company is giving the
premiere of Howard Barker's tough two-acter Hated Nightfall, under his own
direction. All Barker's plays are tough. His is a self-styled 'theatre of
catastrophe', in which the worst conceivable things tend to happen just
because they are conceivable; and blindings on stage in the King Lear manner
are routine.
Hated Nightfall has one - it comes nicely at the end to cap the four fatal
knifings we have witnessed, had our stomachs turned by, and also laughed at;
for though what we see is tragic it is also farce. The play's climate is the
permanent imminence of murder. If a character is not being butchered, he or
she is certainly being lethally threatened; but Barker has found the perfect
donnee for this kind of drama in the mysterious assassination of the
Romanoffs.
When the remains of the Tsar's family were exhumed, two unidentified bodies
were also found, and while Barker soberly conjectures that they were tutor
and maidservant to the Imperial household, his further conjectures about the
mind-set of the former are excitingly wild. Dancer is an all too willing
henchman of the Revolution charged with despatching his former employers and
charges, but possessed by a terrible spirit of historical irony. He does not
need the quasi-Greek conscience-chorus to remind him that he is only a
'transient phenomenon'. As brilliantly played by Ian McDiarmid, this
'Doorman of the Century' is leering, smug, vicious, unstaunchably
loquacious, and tormentedly looking for love.
Stepping ably with him in the dance of death are Nicholas Jones, a desperate
Emperor given to an impotent feyness of gesture; Anna Patrick, a superbly
haughty Empress; Jane Wood as a servant who cannot innocently bustle as she
would like to, since dead bodies strew her path; and Rebecca Charles, Nicola
Walker and sailor-suited Paul Gonshaw as the royal children. The last is a
silent role, but his ritual pouring of black fluid from a watering-can on
the occasion of each murder is peculiarly eloquent. It is a piece of
business worked up from a photograph of the young heir to the throne
wielding such a can.
Five great-coated Bolshevik ruffians including a lady, Claire Rushbrook's
Albeit, who delivers the coup de grace, complete the cast. Johan Engels's
set affords a pertinent contrast of traditional Russian birches and the
stark red telephone pole of the Future. Barker's direction is elegant and
sensible, unlikely though those terms might seem. It is surprising how much
of the complex nuance and poetic force of his text comes across. Yet there
is a sententiousness to his writing that irritates and a lack of resonance -
even at the big moments - reminding one that Barker is not a Bond or a
Beckett. Barker's reliance on the theme of open-eyed savagery can seem as
much an artificial convention as Jane Austen's 'two inches wide of ivory',
and a good deal more limiting.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Arts: Dame Kiri, the Housewife Diva - In celebratory mood,
Alastair Macaulay attends her 50th birthday concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kiri at 50] Those of us for whom Kiri has been a part of our lives for more
than 20 years are all gratitude. As she said to us at her Albert Hall gala
celebration the Albert Hall on Thursday, 'Tonight I've encountered nothing
but love.' Also: 'Fifty is nifty.' What a gal]
We give thanks for her voice, her charm, her frocks, and - not least - her
hairdos. We loved the Pounds 5 programme most for the umpteen photographs it
bore of her: Kiri ash-blonde, Kiri deep brunette, Kiri bouffante, Kiri with
ringlets . . . We know her voice has even more lights than her hair, but we
think it is a close-run thing. And as for the slice of Jane Asher and
Sainsbury's birthday cake that each of us received, well, Kiri, thanks a
million.
For us, so many memories . . . We recall Bernard Levin proclaiming that the
word Kiri would be found written on his heart (and she sang the Countess's
first aria from Figaro, the aria that helped to propel her into legend). We
are haunted by Kiri's dress for the 1981 royal wedding (Kit and the Widow
likened her to 'an illuminated opal fruit'). We cherished Kiri's rugby
anthem; and we could never forget the TV special she began by with 'Mi
chiamano Mimi - but you can call me Kiri.'
For Dame Kiri is famous not only for her voice but also - like Dame Edna -
for her niceness. Edna is Housewife Superstar; Kiri is Housewife Diva. Clive
James, who joined her onstage at the end of Thursday's celebration, was
there to represent all her admirers. 'Your voice is from heaven,' he told
her, 'and your feet are on the ground.' Yes, that's our Kiri.
Possibly Kiri gets her niceness from being a Maori. On Thursday, to remind
us of her roots, she brought the whole Waihirere Maori Group to Britain, to
sing and dance for her at the Albert Hall. Then, after joining them in two
Maori numbers, Kiri sang them 'Climb every mountain': after listening
awkwardly to which they promptly departed.
Now, what is nicest about Kiri's niceness is how carefully she directs it to
the maximum audience. Don't fret if you weren't there on Thursday, for it
will be on ITV, and Decca will shortly release it on CD, cassette, and
video. The most interesting thing about being there live, in fact, was to
compare the actual Kiri to the magnified projection of her on screen. It
proved impossible not to keep turning to the projection, because Kiri kept
addressing the camera. Those dark eyes are stunning, but they would hardly
have registered on us mere paying mortals in the Albert Hall had we not been
able to see them via the camera.
And the same goes for her voice. It is still wonderfully lustrous, only
slightly less well-nourished than of old, rich with so many different
lights, glowing from deep within. It has changed remarkably little since the
first time I heard it, 21 years ago, when she was the offstage Priestess in
Aida; I had never, I thought, heard anything more beautiful. The main thing
that has changed is the way she projects it. It used a voice that made you
positively glad to be in the higher recesses of Covent Garden, for you felt
its impact all the more amazedly far away up there.
These days, however, it doesn't beam out with that kind of address; and on
Thursday Kiri was mainly addressing the microphones. As the evening
progressed, and as she moved - via Rodgers and Hammerstein and Kurt Weill -
to Lloyd Webber, she sang with the aid of more and more amplification. In
terms of audience effect, this paid off. In the first half, the house had
received her pretty and careful accounts of items from the classic rep with
only the merest spattering of applause.
Later, however, Kiri the crossover artist, voice flooding through the
speakers, eyes so gorgeously twinkling into the camera, began to rouse the
audience into life. She even gave us 'With one look' from Sunset Boulevard.
(Just think what a nice Norma Desmond she'd make.) It had glamour, it was
voluptuous . . . and it was even more pre-packaged than Patti Lupone's.
True, Kiri would not be our Kiri were she not an icon of popular culture as
well as of opera. (She would be merely Te Kanawa.) Still, as I marvel again
at that voice, I wish, not that she would tackle less, just that she would
make more of it. But the chances are that Kiri will never know what it is to
be fully awake as an artist, spontaneous and intense. Happy to be the nice,
lovely, arranged, ordinary media personality she knows how to be so well,
she is a sleeping beauty of our day - charming, guarded, and dreamy.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Arts: Drawn to the alphabet - Patricia Morison admires the
letters in a very exclusive edition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has taken ten years and four more years of painstaking printing on iron
hand-presses, but the result is being hailed as a triumph. Ornamented Types
is a two-part limited edition of early 19th-century decorated alphabets
produced by Ian Mortimer of IM Primit of Hackney in London. Printed in a
limited edition of 200, copies of this masterly production of the printer's
art cost Pounds 1,650.
If that is beyond your means, for the next three weeks the alphabets can be
seen in the exhibition, Ornamented Types at St Bride Printing Library in
London.
St Bride Printing Library, owned by the Corporation of London, houses a
magnificent collection devoted to every aspect of the history and technology
of typefounding and printing. The Library has inherited the collection of 32
decorated alphabets, beautifully engraved letters on pieces of end-grain
boxwood. Apparently never used, they are extremely rare survivals.
Commercial type-foundries threw away quantities of old alphabets during the
decades when ornamented letters like these were rejected as 'Victorian'
rubbish. Only the Betjeman faction proclaimed its affection for the
fat-faced, slab-serif alphabets of the early 1800s. With their quaint
decorations, they were designed to appeal to a fairly unsophisticated public
and to stand out boldly on hand-bills, theatre-programmes, auction-notices
and stage-coaches.
The St Bride collection nearly perished when a wartime bomb destroyed the
premises of the Monotype Corporation, which bought them when the Caslon
foundry closed in 1936. However, James Mosley, librarian at St Bride,
succeeded in identifying the mysterious type as coming from the foundry of
L. J. Pouchee.
A little-known but intriguing figure, Pouchee was first a butcher and
coal-merchant. In the 1800s, he seems to have scented a killing to be made
in printing and set up a type-foundry. By paying printers more than
competitors offered, he succeeded in breaking their cartel. He also seems to
have invented the technique known as stereotype casting, in which wooden
original letters were 'dabbed' in hot metal and a cast was made.
Pouchee's ornamented alphabets show an exuberant vein of fantasy. Some are
laden with grapes, covered with swags of flowers, or made into naive
barnyard scenes with wooden-looking milkmaids and cows. Perhaps the most
splendid letters, several inches high, are covered in fashionable florists'
flowers; lilies, camellias, roses.
Most remarkable of all, however, is the Masonic Alphabet. Pouchee was a
freemason - indeed, the records of the Grand Lodge provided Mosley with much
of what he has succeeded in unearthing about Pouchee. Masonic dinners in the
1820s probably had menu-cards printed with his accurate evocation of 'the
Craft'. It is just one of the exhibition's intriguing glimpses of the
commercial and social world of Regency London, conjured up by Pouchee's
fantastical, fat, self-confident alphabets.
Exhibition until March 24 at St Bride Printing Library, Bride Lane, Fleet
Street, London; 071-353-4660.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Arts: Bolted together in totemic splendour - Anthony Caro
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week, within a day of each other, our be-knighted sculptors, Anthony
Caro and Eduardo Paolozzi, achieved their 70th birthdays, and I am delighted
to take this chance of wishing them well. But the temptation of pointing to
the differences between them should be resisted except in the most general
way.
Caro has two exhibitions current, and is the subject of this review;
Paolozzi hasn't, and isn't. Those two shows are distinct in themselves, yet
to take the one without the other is to miss a great deal, for they
complement each other to a remarkable degree. The one at Annely Juda is
beautifully chosen and succinct, setting the retrospective context; and the
one at Kenwood celebrates the latest and continuing creative engagement.
Taken together, the surprise they offer is the realisation that Caro is
rather less the unrepentant formalist and radical influence than we might
have supposed.
It remains true that through his association with the the American, David
Smith, in the years around 1960, he alone of his generation brought to
England, and indeed to Europe, a formal abstraction that was consciously
empty of human reference or association. Here were elements presented just
for themselves: cut, bolted and welded together in well-judged arrangements,
the space clear and open, the form self-evident, the human contact only that
which we have with physical objects in the everyday world.
The raw physical presence of these things as they appeared in the early
1960s, and the stringency of their presentation, were wonderfully new,
stimulating and refreshing. If it now seems somewhat ironic that it should
have been this phase in his work that shot Caro into international stardom,
the irony, as we may now see at Anneley Juda, lies only in the fact that
that phase was so short-lived. What we see so clearly is that Caro has been
working his way back to the figure, or at least to the anthropomorphic
inference of the figure, ever since.
The work of the 1950s, with which the Juda show begins, is directly
figurative, albeit the consciously simple and primitive figuration of such
earth-mother fetishes as the Willendorf Venus - Caro had but lately been
assistant to Henry Moore, a distinguished club that in it its time has
included Bernard Meadows and Phillip King. To move on to the Kenwood show is
to turn if not full circle, at least to spiral back close to the spirit of
those early years, and not just in the open reference to ancient gods and
heroes, but in formal terms.
Here in the Orangery at Kenwood, on their symbolic pedestals and thrones,
sit the totemic presences of Gods, Greeks and Trojans, and we are at once
back to the sculpture of the younger generation of the 1940s and '50s, to
the welded and symbolic totems of Reg Butler and, in particular, to the
precarious monoliths and stele of William Turnbull and, of course, the
fiercer presences of Eduardo Paolozzi. Caro, in propria persona, stands with
his peers once more.
He has lost none of his technical panache. He was ever a consummate
collagist in three dimensions, a bringer-together of disparate elements into
a lively and coherent order. To see these new modelled elements of
terracotta, which supply the symbolic character of the heroic protagonists,
set into or on their matrices of steel and wood, is to discover Caro happily
and unselfconsciously playing the same formal games that engaged him totally
30 years ago, but now subsumed within the narrative whole. The working of
the clay itself takes him back full 40 years, to the modelled figures of the
1950s.
The Homeric narrative is given by John Spurling in the excellent catalogue,
who takes us through the roster of the Olympian and Older Gods, charting
their allegiances and interventions in the affairs of the mortal heroes, the
Trojans and Achaians, and telling us again just who they were and what they
did - Achilles sulking in his tent, Hector un-nerved and doomed. Here they
all are, crammed together beneath Mount Ida, embattled, a wonderful sight.
The Trojan War Sculptures: Kenwood House, Hampstead Lane NW3, until April 6,
then to the Yorkshire Sculpture Park in November. Anthony Caro - Sculpture
through Five Decades: Annely Juda Fine Art, 23 Dering Street W1, until May
7.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Arts: Inspired soloists - Record review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two superlative young violinists have their new concerto recordings on
simultaneous CD release. With Kurt Masur and the Leipzig Gewandhaus, the
ex-Siberian Maxim Vengerov - not yet 20 years old - plays the Mendelssohn
and the hoary old Bruch G minor (on Teldec 4509-90875-2). The American
Joshua Bell, some six years older, plays both of Prokofiev's concerti with
Dutoit and his Montreal orchestra (Decca 440 331-2), who throw in a terrific
Love of Three Oranges Suite for good measure.
Pointless to argue over which of these inspired soloists is the 'better';
better simply to enjoy their distinctive virtues. Vengerov - who struck me
three years ago as the greatest natural violinist I had ever heard, has also
been trained with the utmost seriousness in the 'traditional' repertoire,
Classic and Romantic. He plays dazzling encores, but in more substantial
pieces his phenomenal gifts are placed strictly at the service of the music.
Here, Vengerov's line in the Mendelssohn is at once coolly elegant and
wonderfully intense; his instrument seems capable of all the expressive
inflections of a human voice. For Max Bruch he goes into full-blooded
Romantic mode, just as required, and Masur treats the orchestral part with
enough stern dignity to disguise the fact that this is a fairly bland
period-piece. By contrast, Dutoit's responsibility in Bell's Prokofiev is to
realise as vividly as possible the bizarre colours of the scores, the better
to set off the wicked solo role.
He and his Montreal band (and the sound-engineers) do that to memorable
effect. Indeed, Dutoit and Bell find such richly suggestive depths in the
Second Concerto as to confound the received opinion that it is obviously the
lesser work. In the First Concerto Bell is equal to every virtuoso demand.
There is less devilry in his playing than in some famous performances, but
his uncanny sweetness of tone and utterance - pure, clean-cut, candidly felt
 -makes its own mark; and still in the 'grotesque' episodes he can turn
other-worldly or calculatedly gross in a twinkling.
After Anne Sophie von Otter's triumphant DG programme of Grieg songs last
year, we have another - overlapping Otter's, but very different - from the
young Finnish mezzo Monica Groop (BIS-CD-637), who was much admired at
Cardiff in the 1989 Singer of the Year contest. Von Otter's Grieg is
dramatically forceful (beautiful too, of course), in line with cosmopolitan
fashion since the later 1960s. Native Scandinavian audiences maintain a
soberer taste, as Elisabeth Soderstrom used to tell us.
They resent acting-out and insistent emphases, especially in plain strophic
songs - and even more in those by their national composers. Miss Groop is a
model Scandinavian singer: lovely, open tone, serene simplicity, clearly
attentive to words but never allowing them to bend or warp Grieg's
folk-rooted melodies.
Now a pair of follow-ups, in the cause of Nikolai Medtner (1880-1951) -
fellow-student of Rakhmaninov and Skryabin in Moscow, also a brilliant
pianist and ambitious (conservative, Brahmsian) composer, permanently
resident in Golders Green from 1935. Nikolai Demidenko has been reviving his
piano music with eclat, notably two of the three concerti (on Hyperion
CDA66580). For those who have been intrigued, there are two very grand works
to explore on Russian Disc RD CD 11 019: a sumptuous Piano Quintet in C, and
the huge Violin Sonata op. 44.
Evgeni Svetlanov is the sizzling pianist in both works, and the violinist
Alexander Labko and the great Borodin Quartet match him ('matched', rather:
the recordings date from 1968) in flair and commitment. And in EMI Classics'
'Composers in Person' series, Medtner can be heard delivering his own solo
pieces with scintillating authority, joining Moiseiwitsch in a rollicking
Round-dance, and accompanying Schwarzkopf and Slobodskaya in several sets of
his songs (CDC 7 54839 2, monaural): a fine, illuminating conspectus.
Devotees of the longevitous Catalan composer Federico Mompou (1893-1987)
find something magical in his stripped-down, faux-naf piano idiom, poised
somewhere between Satie and Jean Francaix. I was slightly disappointed to
find that the new Harmonia Mundi CD of his 'orchestral music' (HMC 901482)
offers mere orchestrations by other hands of two piano suites, Suburbis and
the Scenes d'enfants - in professional Impressionist style, attractive but
less striking than the severely black-and-white originals.
There are also, however, two quite unexpected discoveries: Los Improperios,
a noble ecclesiastical 'oratorio' that owes naked debts to Poulenc's Gloria
and Stabat Mater and yet sounds like purest Mompou, and a darkly limpid
song-set, Combat del somni. For those, Mompou at last ventured - in his 70s]
 -to do his own orchestrations, which have the stamp of lean, authentic
character.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Arts: Goodbye to all that . . . - Antony Thorncroft talks to
Lord Palumbo as he leaves his Arts Council post
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the end of this month Lord Palumbo will remove the paintings from the
walls of his Great Peter Street penthouse, take one last look over the roof
tops at his unrivalled view of Westminster Abbey, and depart into the
obscurity from which Lady Thatcher plucked him just over five years ago to
be chairman of the Arts Council.
Peter Palumbo is modest, shy, reticent: not perhaps the obvious qualities
required to be the mouthpiece for the arts, the pressure point on the
government to secure the highest possible levels of subsidy. But Palumbo is
typically dogged in his assessment of his achievements. 'When I was selected
I was not even on the original list. No one wanted the job. But there were
plenty of candidates to be my successor.'
The succession was actually quite predictable. Former Arts Minister (and
Sotheby's chairman) Lord Gowrie takes on the role on April 1. 'He should
sail in calm waters', says Palumbo, well aware of the storms that have
lashed over him, especially in the time consuming, bureaucratic,
re-organisation of the council.
But if the operational hassles are in the past, with a compromise reached
between the strategic role of the council and grass roots devolution to the
Regional Arts Boards, Gowrie will still confront the key problem which made
Palumbo's last year so frustrating: a lack of government cash for the arts.
Unless he did a deal before taking on the job, Gowrie must soon tackle some
life and death crises at leading arts companies, in particular among the
nation's orchestras.
'I feel bitterly disappointed that we were not given a stand-still grant for
this year', says Palumbo. For four years he suffered the upheaval of
institutional change, with five successive ministers responsible for the
arts (including David Mellor twice) having a different view on structures;
from the out-and-out devolution of Tim Renton to the 'all power to me'
approach of Mellor.
But while this was exhausting, and kept Palumbo at the council five days a
week as against the odd afternoon put in by his predecessor Lord Rees-Mogg,
it was unimportant when compared with the increases in grant that Palumbo,
and his ministers, achieved. In real terms the council got a 12 per cent
uplift in subsidy in the four years until March 1994: this is Palumbo's
tangible contribution to the arts.
But from April, the council must make do with a 1.6 per cent cut, the first
in its history. Taken with the furore over his rationalisation plan for the
London orchestras, the reduction in grant has blighted Palumbo's last
months, and given an unfairly melancholic tinge to his stewardship. 'I am
not a resigner but I did think about it. The record of the arts in terms of
their cost effectiveness is such that they did not deserve to be cut.'
For months after last November's announcement Palumbo did not speak to Peter
Brooke, the secretary for National Heritage. They have now made up, but the
breach probably put paid to Palumbo's chance of taking a leading role in
seeing through his brightest idea, the Millennium Fund. He does not blame
Brooke for the reduction in grant. There were powerful forces in the
Treasury, like Michael Portillo, anxious to settle scores with David Mellor,
who had used his friendship with John Major to favour the arts. Whatever the
cause, Palumbo is genuinely distressed.
He is less upset about the mess over the orchestras, when his plan to form a
super-orchestra by merging the LPO and the Philharmonia floundered on press
criticism, the opposition of the musicians, and lack of confidence inside
the Council. He thinks that the future lies in backing fewer companies with
more cash, and that the orchestral issue will come back to haunt Gowrie.
The rows over money and the orchestras did not provoke his decision to
resign after just one term. He says he made that decision three months into
the job, when its time consuming nature became apparent.
As the inheritor of his father's property empire, Palumbo had never been
unduly stretched. He collected the rents and, as a devoted admirer of modern
architecture, dreamed of building a skyscraper designed by Mies van der Rohe
in the heart of the City of London. Prince Charles scotched that one.
So, when the unexpected call came from Margaret Thatcher, Palumbo threw
himself whole heartedly into the Arts Council. 'I've been out every night
for five years', he says. 'I've only seen my wife at the theatre, or a
concert, and not been able to talk to her until one in the morning. I have
three young children. I want to spend more time with them.' He also wants to
complete the development of his site at 1, The Poultry, although this time
with a building designed by Sir James Stirling - also roundly condemned by
Prince Charles.
Until the rows of the last year, Palumbo had built up some modest successes
at the council. 'I was told by a senior civil servant when I took on the job
that it was best to concentrate on three or four things, to do a little well
rather than a lot badly'. So he (naturally) started an architectural unit;
he launched Arts 2000, which encourages each year a different part of the
country to sponsor an arts form in the run up to the millennium; he backed
the Lottery when it became apparent that this was the only possible source
of funding for his millennium projects.
He had his disappointments, notably a pet project, the Arts Foundation,
which got off to a shaky start, and a much touted national strategy document
which was dismissed as trite. But in the main it was solid, unsensational,
progress. Palumbo acknowledged that ministers 'have the right to decide how
the arts are delivered to the consumer' - hence all the organisational
changes - 'but they do not have the right to tell us how to spend the
money.' By quiet diplomacy, supporting the government in public, Palumbo
kept the council independent and afloat. He feels the more let down by
ministers because he played their game.
Palumbo is not sanguine about the immediate future, but he is diplomatic.
'If Grey Gowrie can't get more money for the arts then nobody can'. He
thinks the Philistines are at the gates, and that the performing arts will
be the first to suffer. Peter Brooke may be a believer but there are forces
in the government with no appreciation of the arts or the urban landscape.
It will not be his problem. At 59 he leaves with very little baggage. His
best memories are the opening concert at the Birmingham Symphony Hall with
Rattle, the CBSO and Mahler - 'I was in tears the whole time' - and the
grass roots projects he so assiduously attended: a travelling actor and
electrician in Dorset, encouraging villagers to act out plays; a visual arts
bus visiting the Scottish islands. His main energies will now be devoted to
his first major property development, when he will quickly discover that,
despite five years as the cultural protector of the nation, he has done
little in persuading the public, at least in the City, to share his
enthusiasm for the new, the experimental, the challenging.

SOMETHING LOST BEHIND THE RANGES by John Blashford-Snell HarperCollins
Pounds 18, 374 pages
John Blashford-Snell is one of the last surviving 'explorers' in the
Victorians' understanding of the word. Supported in that tradition by the
Army, he was appointed 'Adventure Training Officer' in Sandhurst in 1963,
which seems to have allowed him to travel to the more obscure corners of the
world at the expense of the taxpayer; he also, it must be granted, did his
duty as a Sapper in various less interesting places like Belfast and
Whitehall.
This autobiography, Something Lost Behind The Ranges, is by no means
Blashford-Snell's first book and it is a surprisingly good read so long as
you are not looking for philosophical insights or deep political analysis
(Haile Selassie is 'one of the most supreme Christian warrior kings the
world had ever known'). What he gives us instead of profundity is a brisk
record of a crowded, dangerous and adventurous life.
After childhood in a Hereford rectory, school in Jersey, and a subaltern's
blooding in Cyprus, Blashford-Snell went off to Ethiopia on 'the expedition
that changed my life' - to attempt to navigate the Blue Nile by raft. He and
his multi-disciplinary team had not reckoned with the bandits and rapids
that awaited them, but they made it, and it made his name.
There followed the founding of the Scientific Exploration Society and 20
years of fun: South America (the Alaska-Cape Horn venture, with the horrors
of the Darien Gap), Oman, Zaire (a scientific route to commemorate the
centenary of Stanley's trans-Africa expedition), Papua New Guinea, East
Africa, Loch Ness, Tibet, Mongolia - and so much and so many miles more.
Blashford-Snell's own role, he explains in a rather endearingly inarticulate
way: 'I am not a scientist but simply, as a Royal Engineer, an
'obstacle-breaker' whose job it was to launch and sustain the experts in
their selected areas to the best of my ability'.
The job got more serious when the adventure-training of young soldiers was
diverted to a larger role by a British government alarmed by the arrival of
a new generation of unemployed. Prince Charles told the Lords that the young
were seeking 'some of the challenges of war in a peacetime situation': HRH
thereafter became one of Blashford-Snell's most important patrons.
The immediate result was Operation Drake in 1978, which sent a a sailing
ship round the world on a variety of good deeds, crewed by 'Young Explorers'
who had been selected by old-fashioned criteria ('We had to get candidates
wet, cold, hungry, miserable, frightened and furious as fast as possible,' -
Blashford-Snell was surprised to find that girls qualified faster than men).
That led to Operation Raleigh, on a larger scale, and eventually in the
late-1980s to a number of 'Executive Expeditions' in which older FT-types
went out to places like Botswana and Nepal to endure the sort of experiences
they were endorsing for the younger generation.
He can be surprisingly funny, particularly about his childhood: he writes of
his pet monkey who seized control of the household Maxim gun; the St Bernard
who devoured the pekingese which cocked a leg over the war memorial; the
ringing of his father's church bell by peppering it with a .300 rifle. The
tone of voice is, shall we say, Sandhurst ('my chums'; 'my jolly, supportive
wife'). There is next to no description of a personal life, and no detail
about the eventual troubles of Operation Raleigh, or, for that matter, the
organising of these formidable expeditions.
This is the very opposite of the life of an actuary or an academic and
Blashford-Snell tells it with gusto.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Books: Charlotte as a fierce survivor - A new biography of
the first feminist novelist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHARLOTTE BRONTE: A PASSIONATE LIFE by Lyndall Gordon Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds
15.99, 403 pages
In 1837, a shy, hopeful vicar's daughter called Charlotte Bronte sent some
of her writings to Robert Southey, the Poet Laureate. 'Madam', came back the
devastating reply 'literature cannot be the business of a woman's life, and
it ought not to be.'
Ten years later, Charlotte answered Southey with Jane Eyre, the first voice
in English fiction of an angry, passionate woman struggling to maintain
independence of spirit and intellect. It was a revolutionary work and a
scandalous bestseller. 'Worth 50 Trollopes and Martineaus, with 50 Dickenses
and Bulwers to keep them company; but rather a brazen Miss,' wrote one male
critic.
Was Charlotte Bronte a brazen miss? She has always been seen as the waif of
literary history - a legend started by Mrs Gaskell, whose first Life of
Charlotte as a timid genius destroyed by hardship and suffering, influenced
all subsequent Bronte scholarship.
In this triumphant new biography, Lyndall Gordon turns the tables. Here
Charlotte is a fierce survivor who, in life and in art, turned loss to gain,
and found unexpected happiness. Outwardly she shrank and cringed, but the
clues to the fire and rage of Jane Eyre and Villette, says Gordon, lie in
'that unseen space in which gifted women of Charlotte's time were forced to
live.' Sensitive, open-minded, vivid, full of psychological insight, her
book is a brilliant reappraisal of Charlotte Bronte's life, work and the
flow between the two.
Born in 1816, Charlotte was motherless by the age of five and packed off to
a grim charity boarding school at eight. One of her early memories was
watching her sister Maria die, of starvation and physical abuse at the hands
of a sadistic teacher - recreated as the terrifying Miss Scatchard in Jane
Eyre. The experience was seminal for all the Brontes, pushing Emily toward
unworldliness and submission, Charlotte to rebellion.
As governesses to the idle rich, the Bronte girls continued to be
ill-treated and under-stimulated. Liberation came with an invitation from a
school friend to learn French in Brussels - the romantic city of Villette.
At 26, Charlotte fell in love with Monsieur Heger, her flamboyant professeur
of rhetoric] 'His mind was my library, and whenever it was opened to me, I
entered bliss.'
Sex flooded into the classroom. He puffed cigar smoke into her desk to let
her know he had left a gift. In her French essays, she responded with a
torrent of ambition and desire, announcing 'I believe I have genius.' Heger
retreated, and soon an outraged Madame Heger escorted her to the Ostend boat
and restricted letters to two a year. Back at her father's bleak parsonage,
polite schoolgirl missives alternated with wild outpourings - 'I love French
for your sake with my heart and soul.'
In this desperate encounter, argues Gordon, Charlotte found her own voice,
then transformed it into the pressingly truthful public speech of Jane Eyre,
where Jane talks to Rochester not 'through the medium of custom,
conventionalities, nor even mortal flesh - it is my spirit that addresses
your spirit . . . equal - as we are.' Feminist critics have read this as
gender antagonism, with Rochester blinded and emasculated at the end.
Gordon, relating the book to its origins in Charlotte's life, sees her as 'a
speaker for the soul as well as for women.'
Lionised over Jane Eyre, Charlotte refused to roar. In London she seemed
provincial and gauche - when Thackeray gave a party in her honour she
snubbed his society friends, huddled in the corner with the governess, and
Thackeray fled to his club.
A flirtatious friendship with her publisher, George Smith, also became
fraught. Smith was the model for charming Graham Bretton in Villette (1854),
but when Charlotte realised his shallowness, she wrote him out of the third
volume in favour of a Belgian teacher based on Heger. She always spoke most
eloquently to men on paper. Smith got the message - and underpaid her for
the book.
Villette, with its icy heroine Lucy Snowe, is the tale of a woman's rise
from frozen passivity to eloquence - Charlotte's own Brussels story. But in
life, there was a twist. By the time Villette finished, all Charlotte's
siblings had died of consumption and she was alone. At the height of her
creative powers, she married her father's curate, who she had always
despised as her intellectual inferior. He was loyal, kind but disapproved of
her writing; she abandoned it.
Perfection of the life, or of the work? asked Yeats. It was a sober but
valid choice. She swapped art for happiness, and when she died in pregnancy,
aged 38, 'Charlotte was the only Bronte to die with human love on her lips.'
Gordon explores her life in both a Victorian and contemporary context. She
contrasts Charlotte's approach with that of men about town like Dickens and
Thackeray, who had instant access to 'the Condition of England'. She places
her in a tradition of radical women writers - Emily Dickinson, Woolf, Plath
 -for whom periods of madness and depression were part of the creative
process. As literary and social history, this is a far-reaching, erudite
study. It is also a deeply-moving story.

Philosophy is the attempt to clarify, and if possible to answer, questions
about reality, knowledge, reason, truth and value. It is a highly
consequential enterprise; it gave birth to the natural sciences, among them
physics and biology, and the social sciences, among them sociology and
psychology. It is the wellspring of enquiry, and the forum for discussion of
all the ultimate questions; but it is also an intellectual hospice for our
currently unsolvable problems, whether of practice or theory.
Isaiah Berlin once remarked that the philosopher in his study can change the
course of history within a generation. He had in mind Locke and Rousseau,
whose writings are quoted verbatim in the documents of the American and
French revolutions, and Marx, whose shadow lies long across our age. But he
might easily have mentioned many other philosophers whose ideas have shaped
science, art, and all other spheres of human endeavour, both for good and
ill.
Roger Scruton's aim is to introduce us to modern philosophy thus conceived.
He accordingly explains the nature and purpose of discussion in all its main
areas: the theory of knowledge, logic, metaphysics, ethics, the philosophy
of language, and much besides, starting from Rene Descartes in the 17th
century and bringing us up to date with contemporary debates. Scruton is a
masterly writer; his book is a paradigm of lucidity, written with a crisp
elegance that proves, by example, the justice of his attack on the jargon
and obscurantism which infects much present-day philosophy and prevents its
wider appreciation.
A study of philosophy, Scruton says, is a study of arguments and ideas. The
questions that generate them have a particular character: they are abstract,
in that they concern the most general kinds or categories of things, and
they are ultimate, in that they concern the fundamental reasons and causes
of things. For example: the question, 'Why did she fall?' relates to a
particular concrete event. 'Why do things fall?', although more general, is
still a scientific, not a philosophical, question. 'What kind of thing is a
fall?' - inviting the answer, 'an event', and therefore a discussion of
whether events are basic constituents of the universe - is an entirely
general question, and shows what kind of understanding philosophy seeks.
The ultimacy point arises from our need for explanations. If B is the
explanation for A, and if B is in turn explained by C, we will hope that
there is some terminus D or even Z which gives the final explanation for A,
because if the chain of reasons or causes continues ad infinitum we will
have no explanation for A after all. Can the ultimate grounds of anything -
even of the world as a whole - be discovered? Philosophy tries to find out.
Another defining feature of philosophy is its quest for truth. Not all human
endeavour aims at truth; some aims at convenience, some at persuasion, some
trades in fictions. But philosophy is the endeavour to find out how things
really are. The sciences try to do this in their own particular spheres; but
philosophy attempts the overview, in the hope of devising a framework for
understanding ourselves and the world.
Scruton systematically tackles the abstract and ultimate questions which
have most exercised philosophers from the 17th century until now. His
discussion is based on introductory lectures delivered at Birkbeck College
in the University of London, and is therefore aimed at beginners. The result
is bracing, entertaining and informative. Anyone wishing to learn about
philosophy will find it an excellent place to start.
There are, however, caveats. Scruton is notorious for holding disagreeable
right-wing views, which would not matter if he could stop himself making
irrelevant allusions to them, with neither explanation nor justification.
But he cannot so resist. For example, in the middle of describing Logical
Positivism's 'verification' theory he suddenly and without further
discussion remarks that it is 'part of the 'culture of repudiation' whereby
central Europe threw away its inheritance and committed moral suicide.' No
opportunity for a dig at the Left or Modernism is missed; and although the
result is often enough amusing, it also injects too polemical and unargued a
note into what is meant to be an introduction to the enterprise of reason
itself, for which dispassion is an ideal.
There are also odd mistakes. Bishop Berkeley did not deny the existence of
the physical world, as Scruton claims, thereby perpetuating an old
misunderstanding; nor is empiricism a 'metaphysical' theory, that is, a
theory about reality; it is an epistemological theory, that is, a theory
about the nature and sources of knowledge. But when Scruton is not grinding
axes or hurrying too fast, he is a highly readable guide. Especially
praiseworthy are his chapters on aesthetics and ethics, and his robust
criticism of aspects of contemporary French thought. Scruton sees philosophy
as an integral part of general education; caveats aside, his book
marvellously shows why that is right.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Books: Life and times of a paper tiger - The self-appointed
voice of Britain's Jewish community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD KAUFMAN

<TEXT>
THE JEWISH CHRONICLE AND ANGLO-JEWRY, 1841-1991 by David Cesarani Cambridge
University Press Pounds 40, 329 pages
Two Jews stood before a firing squad. Said one, 'I'm going to ask for a
blindfold.' Retorted the other, 'Don't cause trouble.'
For most of its 150 years as the self-appointed voice of Britain's Jewish
community, the Jewish Chronicle has been trying not to cause trouble.
Occasionally the newspaper has been led by men, either wayward or brilliant,
who have failed to base their editorial policies on a groping search for the
lowest common denominator. In 1927 Leopold Greenberg, ignoring the timorous
bleatings of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, campaigned -
successfully - on behalf of Oscar Slater, a Jew wrongfully convicted of
murder. In the 1930s Jack Rich, again shaking off restraint from the Board
of Deputies, advocated boycotting German goods after the Nazis came to power
and supported opposition to fascist marches in the streets of London's East
End.
In 1946 Ivan Greenberg was sacked for supporting the terrorist gangs running
amok in British-occupied Palestine; the Jewish Chronicle's directors drew
the line at his hailing various atrocities as 'Jewish Resistance
Operations.' A very different kind of editor - perhaps its best ever - was
William Frankel, who wrote in 1974: 'It is today beyond doubt that the
Palestinians have developed a real sense of identity. They form an intrinsic
part of the jigsaw puzzle of Middle East politics and they cannot be ignored
or wished into silence.'
Mostly, however, the newspaper's editors have accepted the dictum which is
attributed by David Cesarani in this book to Frankel's successor, Geoffrey
Paul, that: 'a newspaper, at least one like the Jewish Chronicle, could not
run ahead of its readership, crusading for one particular cause which they
did not share.' Paul banned his reporters from interviewing representatives
of the Palestine Liberation Organisation on the grounds that: 'a majority of
our readers would misinterpret our intentions.'
That approach would have found favour with the Jewish Chronicle's directors
who, in announcing the dismissal of Ivan Greenberg, laid down the 'main
lines' of the paper's policy as 'Moderate Zionist in respect to
Palestine/Orthodox as regards the Jewish religion/Strictly loyal in relation
to HMG.'
At times the paper's Zionism was so moderate as to be almost indiscernible.
When Theodore Herzl announced the convening of a congress to found the
Zionist Organisation, the Chronicle wailed that 'the very notion of an
'International Congress' was an insult to the patriotism of Jews' and liable
to give rise to 'groundless insinuations that Jews are now confessedly
unpatriotic.'
Strict loyalty to HMG was at delicate moments interpreted so assiduously as
to make cringing seem positively daring. The most venomous anti-Semites,
when advocating anti-Jewish immigration legislation at the beginning of this
century, could not have outdone the Jewish Chronicle's categorisation of
wretched newcomers from Eastern Europe as 'the mediaevalised overflow of the
Russia and Romanian Ghettos', its jocularly expressed bafflement as to 'why
these magnetic Poles are attracted to our shores', and its advocacy of
repatriation, based on the belief that 'men such as these should be returned
to their native places.'
Such views were supported by letters from readers, which expressed fear of
'competition from lowly paid foreign Jews.' It is indeed the comfortably-off
who have generally been most at home with the paper. The upwardly-striving
were guided by property advertisements in its columns to move house to those
posh neighbourhoods of Golders Green, Edgware and their like which were the
preferred locations for what Cesarani calls the 'galloping suburbanisation'
of London Jewry.
Although in 1938 the Chronicle expressed the view that in order that
ostentatious affluence should not provoke anti-Semitism - 'It might be a
good or a bad thing if Jews were to ration, if they could, their
representation in the professions' - by 1985 readership surveys (says
Cesarani) 'showed that 48 per cent of JC readers were in social classes A
and B, although only 17 per cent of the total British adult population
normally fell into these categories . . . The terminal age of education was
'considerably higher' than the national average, and the percentage of home
ownership, at 87 per cent, was 'far in excess' of nationwide trends.'
No wonder that, when the paper did poke its head above the parapet to bemoan
anti-Semitism, its particular concerns included exclusion of Jews from
certain golf clubs and quotas against Jews seeking admission to public
schools.
In this admirably researched, if somewhat gracelessly written, volume,
Cesarani points out that its 'readership profile makes the Jewish Chronicle
a highly attractive medium' for advertisers; indeed, each week the paper's
pages demonstrate anew that this successful and long-lived publication
faithfully reflects that minority of the Jewish community who buy it, in
being prosperous, conformist and complacent.

MARBLE SKIN by Slavenka Draculic The Women's Press Pounds 5.99, 188 pages
THE GREAT UMBILICAL: MOTHER, DAUGHTER, MOTHER, THE UNBREAKABLE BOND by
Rachel Billington Hutchinson Pounds 17.99, 238 pages
DEAR MOTHER . . .WOMEN WRITING TO OR ABOUT THEIR MOTHERS edited by Marijke
Woolsey and Susan King The Women's Press Pounds 6.99, 173 pages
Just in time for Mothering Sunday, when the recipes for Simnel cake and the
tiny purple non-books of verse come into bloom, these three volumes offer a
rich selection of mother and daughter experiences. Both the Billington and
the Women's Press anthologies yield food for thought, while Slavenka
Draculic's novel Marble Skin comes labelled 'Unsuitable Gift For Mother'.
Draculic is a Croatian novelist and journalist, a co-founder in 1979 of the
first feminist group in Yugoslavia, and the author of the non-fiction How We
Survived Communism and Even Laughed. There are no laughs in Marble Skin, an
intense and claustrophobic narration of a daughter's survival of life with
mother. Soon after the story opens - 'I thought I had already forgiven my
mother for everything' - the daughter, now grown-up and a sculptor, makes a
nude statue and exhibits it under the title 'My Mother's Body'. When
visitors to the show, challenged by the sculpture's sensuality, leave dirty
fingermarks on mother's skin, the daughter feels nauseous but also, 'a
strange excitement gripped me at the thought of all these people doing what
I had never been able to do, at the thought of the forbidden gesture.'
Mother sees a photograph of the reclining nude in a newspaper and attempts,
not for the first time, suicide. Why is the daughter so obsessed with her
mother's body, and what has the unhappy woman done to inspire such revenge?
Mother, in flashback, is a beautiful and deeply sensuous young widow. Not
unnaturally, she attempts to conceal her private life but the child, plagued
by her mother's silence on matters physical, grows into something of a
Peeping Tom. Mother is also fanatical about cleanliness, and when a rare
guest spills wine on her white tablecloth the incident inevitably predicts
trouble at menarche. She remarries and before long the stepfather is
visiting the girl's bedroom and she shatters the veneer of their lives by
telling her mother that he has raped her. Mother sends her away for years
and not until she is old, broken and alone can her daughter forgive her.
Draculic's telling of her bleak, inverted Oedipal tale is masterly, her
prose by turns spare and sensual, but her narrator's stony egotism chills.
In The Great Umbilical Rachel Billington traces the progress of an imaginary
little girl from babyhood to grandmotherhood, with many reflective stops
along the way. The author's views that the influence of the female line is
stronger than that of father to son, and that there is an unbreakable bond
between mother and daughter that is a positive force for good in society,
will neither shock nor challenge, but her enthusiasm is another nail in the
coffin of the 'blame mother for everything' movement so fashionable a few
years ago. This is a book to dip into, packed with mini-case histories and
opinions which will infuriate and intrigue.
Dear Mother . . . which has its share of embarrassments and duds, contains
three or four outstanding pieces and several of interest, as well as
familiar but none-the-worse-for-that extracts from Virginia Woolf, Maya
Angelou and Alice Walker. In An Indian Woman Speaks, the anonymous narrator
tells the immensely cheering tale of a mother travelling to England to
rescue her daughter from a hideous arranged marriage, and Catherine Cookson
 -good to see her up there with the serious sisters - writes compassionately
about her own poor dissolute mother.
The collection's gem, however, is taken from May Sarton's A Wild Green
Place. This has a dual mother/daughter theme as it evokes marvellously a
period in Sarton's mother's childhood when she was sent to stay with an old
Welsh woman and her disturbed and violent daughter. Astonishingly, Judith
Arcana who introduces the anthology says of this strange and moving story
only that it 'shows us the desperate importance of knowing our mothers in
terms of their own lives before we were their daughters, before they were
anyone's mothers.' It does, but it shows us much more, as do the best
ingredients of this celebration of mothers and daughters.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Gardening: And Squirrel Nutkin got the blame . . . - . . .
unjustifiably, says Robin Lane Fox, who is worried about his yew hedge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hedging has been blamed for a lot recently, but I do not feel the blame has
gone far enough. In 1989, I made an investment; now, I have lost the lot. It
has cost me Pounds 600 and five years of my time.
In 1989, I planted two long yew hedges. The yews came through a Yorkshire
king of garden-centre stocking who sourced them, as he put it, in Belgium.
They arrived - strong, bushy and far from cheap. They went in 2ft apart in a
staggered line.
A year earlier, however, I had begun with another line of smaller and
cheaper yews, bought in transit from Gloucestershire's Batsford Garden
Centre in the gardens of Batsford Park. The manager did warn me that these
yews were small and had just arrived from Cornwall. So, having a few Belgian
spares, I used these in 1989 to thicken up the 1988 line.
During the summer, one of the 1988 intake turned bronze, not green, and I
blamed the drought and academic pressure on the hosing schedule. In 1990,
eight more of the Batsford batch turned bronze, too. Perhaps they had been
dry, I thought, and the drought was taking a year to show the effect. They
were not dead, though, and they were showing some green shoots.
In 1991, however, they were bronze all over. This started to bother their
big Belgian brothers; by 1992, most of this hedge was burnished to a height
of 2ft. And the trouble was spreading at a T-junction where a second Belgian
hedge began, previously unscathed and bushing healthily.
In January 1993, I consulted the experts at the Hillier Arboretum. Burn the
lot, they told me, with cheerful confidence. First, though, pack up a rooted
specimen and send it to a laboratory. I returned from Hillier and
compromised. I took out the totally-tanned yews and substituted my next-best
evergreen, osmarea. Belgian buttresses remained, only slightly browned and
set thickly with leaves.
The osmarea grew throughout the summer but the Belgian buttresses turned
bronze. At the T-junction, the upper growths of their brothers began to look
twisty and thinly-needled. I have an eye for sickness, and it told me they
were ill.
I have watched them throughout the winter. No-one now can complain of
drought, except for a water authority, and my Cotswold soil drains quickly;
it is not waterlogged. But nothing has improved and I have just removed the
last of the 1988-89 intake. I have lost Pounds 500 of yew and Pounds 100 of
labour and preparation. When we dug up the plants, they were not rooted very
widely - but there were no visible scars or infections.
This week, I have consulted more experts, beginning at the Royal
Horticultural Society's Wisley headquarters where Pippa Greenwood, in plant
pathology, is celebrating her promising debut on the BBC's Gardeners'
Question Time.
At Hillier, the experts mentioned phytophthora: could they have been right?
Unlikely, Greenwood told me, because the RHS had been pestered by the public
with just this problem since 1990; and, although it had tested clinically,
traces of phytophthora turn up only seldomly. Anyway, if you have it, bark,
branches and leaves turn brown, not bronze.
Then what? I asked her. The answer, she suggested, was cultivation. The yews
might have been planted badly - too dry, or perhaps too wet, or possibly
both. Probably they were put in too deep, so the roots could not find
oxygen. She said she saw this problem often on yews sent in by members of
the RHS.
I protest. I have been taught how to garden. I am actually rather good at
it. You would never catch me planting yews too deeply.
Please do not take it personally, she reassured me: the RHS met lots of
people who were obviously very good gardeners but still could make trifling
 -and common - mistakes.
What about the National Trust? I asked. Did it not have a problem with old
yew hedges which were showing brown patches halfway up? Yes, she agreed, but
it could well be rodents: it was amazing how squirrels, for instance, could
climb up a hedge and ring its bark at quite a height. Greenwood will see
that diseased specimens are examined if sent to Wisley by members of the
RHS.
On Greenwood's advice, I then rang the Forestry Commission's David Rose, at
Alice Holt Lodge, Wrecclesham, Farnham, Surrey GU10 4LH. While the
commission usually contracts its knowledge for a fee, Rose will be willing
to consider investigating yew trees if enough readers write in with evidence
of a similar problem.
First, he absolved the National Trust rodent. At Buckland Abbey, the trust
lost an old yew hedge and some younger plantings of yew, but the cause was
diagnosed as phytophthora which is, in Rose's view, 'by far the commonest
cause of death in yew'.
This, of course, does not suit my problem: I have bronzing, not browning,
and my plants are not actually dead. So, Rose asked, what about the
cultivation? Too wet, too dry, too deep? Or might it be the climate: cold
winds (and they are cold in the Cotswolds) or sudden frost?
Ask an expert and you almost believe him. But wait. The bronzing began on
only one plant and spread first to only one batch. It took six years  - yet,
all the yews face the same wind, the same drought and the same old Adam in
the gardener. How can they be the cause?
At this point, I think I trust my common sense. I believe that Batsford gave
the disease to Belgium and the others are fighting infection. And I think I
know where it came from: across the Channel. It infiltrated Cornwall on
imported Eurostock and spread to London with people who buy plants in
transit to sell them.
Before you plant a yew hedge, be clear that the stock is clean, its source
reputable and do not plant it too deep. Meanwhile, if you know of trouble,
write to Rose and give details. Something other than phytophthora is abroad
and I refuse to believe that the culprit is Squirrel Nutkin.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Equestrianism: Enter the aristocrats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seven aristocratic visitors from the east are currently stretching their
legs in the green shoots of the Russian Horse Society's paddocks at Epsom,
in Surrey.
Four stallions and three mares of the rare Caspian breed of horse arrived in
the UK on February 22 at the end of a journey which took them by truck from
Tehran, through Azerbaijan and Georgia, across the Caucasus mountains, and
through the Ukraine to Brest in Belarus, where they were quarantined before
continuing to England.
Their arrival is a milestone in the history of the breed.
The Caspian, believed extinct, was rediscovered almost 30 years ago by
Louise Firouz, an American married and settled in Iran. It was first
imported to Britain in the early 1970s.
Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, was given a stallion and a mare by
Firouz, forming part of the UK's foundation stock for these stylish horses,
acknowledged now to be one of the oldest breeds in the world and a
forerunner of the Arab.
Approximately 19 horses were imported from 1971 until the revolution in 1977
stopped exports and dispersed existing stocks in Iran.
Their discovery has a fairy-tale ring. Firouz had been searching for mounts
for younger pupils at her riding school and discovered a small bay stallion,
perfectly proportioned, in a village on the shores of the Caspian sea.
Further sorties uncovered more horses, their diminutive, fine-boned bodies
contrasting sharply with the heavier, coarser Mongolian and Turkoman horses
of the area.
The Caspians proved perfect school horses, popular with parents and pupils,
encouraging Firouz to research and foster the breed. By the late 1970s she
held a herd of 200 horses, only to be dispersed and almost lost in the
revolution.
The second revival of the breed in Iran owes much to the chance discovery of
a handful of Caspians in a barn of more than 1,000 horses being sold off by
the Revolutionary Guard in 1989.
The Caspian stands between 10.3 and 12.3 hands, with an Arab-type head,
slender limbs and fine, silky coat.
They are intelligent gentle, move with elegance and panache and are equally
at home under saddle, in harness or on lead-rein.
Their disposition makes them ideal children's mounts, particularly fond of
jumping, but they are also extremely successful as driving horses, proving
themselves genuine all-rounders that the whole family can enjoy.
The UK has approximately 260 registered Caspians, spread throughout six
large studs and numerous smaller operations. There are also studs in
Australasia and the US.
Two of the new arrivals are currently in quarantine in Epsom before going to
the US to augment the bloodlines of foundation stock.
Meanwhile, their companions can breathe easy and deep in the security of the
English countryside, a far cry from a rolling truckride across Russia.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Motoring: Is the revolution here? - Stuart Marshall detects
changes in car design which may presage major upheavals / Geneva motor show
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For years, most cars were three-box (bonnet, body and boot) saloons. Then
came the two-box hatchback (bonnet and body with integral load space). And
now it looks as if it will be the turn of the one-box car. The first signs
of what could be a major upheaval in car design are evident at Geneva salon
international de l'automobile this week. Marginally different - you could
call them badge and grille engineered  - versions of a tall, chisel-nosed
vehicle jointly developed by the Fiat and Peugeot groups are on the Citroen,
Fiat, Lancia and Peugeot stands.
They prove that Renault got it absolutely right when it launched the Espace.
Ten years later it is still Europe's best selling multi-purpose people
carrier and, at any rate in styling, the new Fiat-Peugeot product looks
rather like a carbon copy.
Peugeot 806 and Citroen Evasion versions of the new vehicles, powered by
2.0-litre petrol engines, one of them turbo-charged, will go on sale on
mainland Europe in mid-summer. But Britain will have to wait another year
for right-hand drive production, by which time there will also be a
turbo-diesel.
The new MPV (multi-purpose vehicle) is front-wheel driven, has twin sliding
doors and takes five people plus a mass of luggage, or up to eight, all on
face-forward seats, if they are travelling light.
At the moment, MPVs are a minority choice in Europe with around 150,000 sold
annually, half of them Renault Espaces. The industry believes that by the
end of the decade it could be half-a-million, though this could be an
under-estimate if the current fashion for using on-off road 4 x 4s as car
substitutes should run out of steam. The MPV would then be a logical
replacement. Its driving position is as high and the interior space as
generous as an on-off roader's but it rides and handles like a normal car
and uses less fuel.
One of the most intriguing Geneva exhibits is the Lexus Landau, a research
prototype shown by ItalDesign that looks half way between a hatchback and an
MPV. It is based on a Toyota Lexus GS300 platform but has a V8 engine
instead of a V6 and four-wheel drive.
Although its body is 2ft (60cm) shorter than a Lexus GS300's, it is 2in
(5cm) taller and offers a lot more space for people and luggage. It is too
early for any talk of possible production. But the current Lexus GS300
luxury executive saloon owes a great deal to a Jaguar-engined ItalDesign
prototype called the Westminster displayed at Geneva four years ago. Jaguar
showed no interest in it. Toyota did and history could repeat itself. Today,
there is a trend away from sheer bulk. Reasonably enough, buyers want cars
that are large inside but do not take up too much road space - just like the
Lexus Landau.
There are new cars galore at Geneva. The recently introduced Volkswagen Golf
and Citroen ZX estate cars have been joined by a class rival, the Rover 400
Tourer, which has made its world debut at the salon.
Rover does not call its dual-purpose car an estate though that is what it
is. The elegant Rover 400 Touring has a high class and traditional-looking
interior. Buyers will have a choice of 1.6-litre or 2.0-litre petrol engines
or a 1.8 litre turbo-diesel when the car goes on sale in June, priced from
Pounds 14,495.
Renault's Laguna (this column, 19 Feb) and General Motors' new Vauxhall
(Opel) Omega which replaces the Vauxhall Carlton will be hotting up the
competition in the medium and medium/large company car market this year.
Omegas, which are rear-wheel driven, come with saloon or estate car bodies.
Petrol engines range from a 2-litre four-cylinder to a 3-litre in-line six
but the pick is the British-made 2.5-litre V6. The diesel has a turbocharged
straight six bought-in from BMW. Like the petrol cars, it will be available
with automatic transmission. Prices are expected to start at Pounds 16,000
when they go on sale next month.
Nissan chose Geneva as launch pad for its striking new 200SX
high-performance sporting coupe that competes with the new Toyota Celica
(described in this column last week). Yet another good looking two-door was
unveiled by Honda - the Accord coupe, conceived and built in the US. It is
due in Britain in May.
Two new German cars attracting a lot of attention are the BMW Compact, a
3-door variation on the 3-Series theme, and Audi's stunning all-light alloy
A8 luxury saloon.
Although the 1.6-litre or 1.8-litre engined Compact is aimed downmarket of
what one thinks of as typical BMW buyers, it concedes nothing in terms of
safety and convenience. Anti-lock brakes, driver airbag and power steering
are all part of the package.
Having been shown thinly disguised as a prototype last autumn at Frankfurt,
the Audi 8 was hardly a surprise. But it shows how a high performing luxury
saloon's weight and environmental impact can be reduced when other new
models generally get heavier.
More of the Audi A8 and other Geneva exhibits next week.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Entrepreneurs are sold short
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGINA JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On January 15, Jane Whitehead told of how her dream of running her own small
shop turned into a nightmare. Georgina James, retail chairman British
Chambers of Commerce reflects on the experience.
As an independent fashion retailer myself Jane Whitehead's article, on the
rise and demise of her childrenswear shop was distressing. It deepened my
concern about the quality and effectiveness of UK business advice.
Did any adviser suggest she get some retail experience before launching into
such a volatile market? Did she discuss the pitfalls with a small
shopkeeper? Apparently not. Practical guidance seems to have been absent.
Absent it still is. Start-up failure rates remain depressingly high in spite
of training and enterprise councils, local enterprise companies, export
agencies, glossy Department of Trade and Industry brochures, business
bureaux, small firms services, college courses and a welter of government
subsidised initiatives.
There is one shining exception: the Prince's youth business trust. This
offers small loans or grants to disadvantaged people under 29 who have been
refused money from every other source. The real no-hopers one would think.
But 70 per cent make it to the end of the first year and 60 per cent to the
end of the third. These figures are more than double the average.
The trust's success is due to its system of giving a start-up unlimited
access to its own guardian angel - a volunteer who also runs a small or
medium-sized company and has experience of the problems.
Contrast this with official agencies. Each needs its own bureaucracy. Each
has financial targets and limits on its activities. Often the majority of
staff are ex-civil servants or managers from big companies, (seconded,
retired or redundant). They are experts in their fields, but not as
versatile as smaller company owners must be. They do not understand small
business culture.
Public funding is necessary because small companies need non-commercial
services. The government view is that it must keep tight hold of structure,
purse strings and policy. This contrasts starkly with its other view, that
direct service provision should be privatised.
It would be possible and proper for independent groups to take on this work
under contract; groups such as chambers of commerce which are directly
accountable to the business community.
At a Moscow conference of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development recently, I was the only speaker who earned my living running a
small business. I was mobbed by Russians eager for practical advice. The
eminent economists, civil servants, bankers and academics who also spoke
were unable to answer their questions.
More recently I met a TEC adviser and his client. He was a retired export
expert from a large clothing company. She had a talent for designing and
knitting jumpers. The TEC had matched them because they were both 'in
textiles'. It was an incompatible pairing. She needed to know things which
those in large companies never learn because so much is taken care of in
other departments.
Many UK business people are bewildered by the haphazard nature of official
help: they feel that bank managers, for example, know more about selling
pensions than they do about the nitty gritty of commercial life.
It is not enough to appoint a few business people to quangos and pretend
that this amounts to 'private sector control'. We have to find a way to
expand the system of linking those with ideas - but no experience and little
money - to those with small business nous and the desire to pass it on.
Until then the careers of many more eager entrepreneurs will be, in Thomas
Hobbes' words, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Future forged from the past -
Chris Topp works in wrought iron. He tells Clive Fewins why it is better
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chris Topp did not stand at a forge and work hot metal until he was 27.
Seventeen years later he is one of England's best-known blacksmiths and the
force behind the move to 'rediscover' wrought iron.
Topp started The Campaign for Real Iron in the early 1980s when he realised
that the skills associated with the traditional material of the blacksmith
were disappearing.
'The last works producing wrought iron in this country closed in 1984. After
that, it was a case of running fast to pick up whatever stocks were
available,' said Topp. 'A limited amount is being produced at the Ironbridge
Gorge Museum. But 10 years ago the situation looked bleak.'
In 1980, Topp won a Pounds 9,000 contract to construct elegant early 18th
century-style gates and railings at a country house near York for a client
who appreciated the difference between the mild steel that was usually
supplied, and real wrought iron.
The problem was: where to find the wrought iron. He heard of a huge
stockpile, originally the handrail on the south pier at Sunderland, that was
about to be thrown away and dashed to the north east. He returned with 15
tons, a load that cost him Pounds 200, but which laid the foundations of his
business.
'In 1980 I moved to North Yorkshire from the restoration engineering company
I had been managing in Derbyshire to try to get away from people constantly
dropping in and asking me to mend prams and sledges,' said Topp. 'I managed
to buy the former village garage, which became my forge, plus the house that
went with it for Pounds 32,000.
'I was keen to get into some real restoration work, though initially I was
resigned to making fire irons, and mild steel gates masquerading under the
misnomer of wrought iron to sell to tourists and local garden centres.'
Fortunately, the York contract put paid to that. Through his former contacts
in Derbyshire and local conservation bodies Topp found he had enough
restoration work to support his wife and young daughter.
'My main desire was to do forge work,' said Topp. 'From an early age I had
been fascinated by iron. When I was at school in Bolton I used to go and
watch the men at the Atlas Ironworks, now reconstructed at Ironbridge.'
After gaining a degree in civil engineering at Newcastle University, Topp
worked briefly for British Waterways where he concentrated on jobs involving
18th and 19th century iron structures.
He started the Derbyshire workshop with a few old school friends, but when
that diversified in the late 1970s he decided to branch out on his own.
The original stockpile from Sunderland has long gone. In its place is a
stock of assorted vintages of wrought iron. Topp lovingly strokes a rusting
bar of metal and pronounces it some of the finest produced in the early 18th
century for the school of Jean Tijou.
He is using some of this to restore a magnificent pair of gates from Marston
Trussell Hall in Northamptonshire in a contract worth Pounds 10,000.
'This is the sort of work I love,' said Topp. 'The work at that period was
so delicate and well proportioned.' The end of the 18th century brought the
introduction of mass-produced puddled irons - inferior, in Topp's view, to
the earlier work made and refined in charcoal fires.
However for everyday purposes the two are indistinguishable.
'Both offer a resistance to rust and corrosion you will not find in steel,'
he said. 'Their fibrous nature means they are unsurpassed for ornamental
ironwork, where there is a lot of fine beaten three dimensional metalwork.
Wrought iron costs about five times as much as mild steel, which was
introduced in the 1850s. In spite of the cost, Topp has not had a slack
period in 14 years. He has supplied work to the Prime Minister's residence
at 10 Downing Street, Chatsworth House in Derbyshire, Warwick Castle, and
other famous and historic buildings.
'A Pounds 10,000 job is not a big contract nowadays,' Topp said. 'In 1992 we
turned over Pounds 85,000 and made a net profit of Pounds 21,000. Last year
we hit a very big seam of work and I hope the figures will show we doubled
that.
'One big job for six tons of wrought iron glazing bars in 19 different
sections for a large Dublin restoration job was worth almost Pounds 80,000.
Much of the work was more repetitious than I prefer, but for that size of
job it was worth it.'
Topp is midway through a Pounds 35,000 contract for decorated wrought iron
seaside railings - they include buckets and spades and windsurfers - for the
resort of Redcar.
One disappointment, however, is the market for cheaper one-off items made in
mild steel. 'There is intense competition for this sort of work  - railings
produced to a budget in city centres are a typical example. I reckon I need
to pull in Pounds 120 a day per man for that sort of work in order to be
profitable, but it has been nearer Pounds 80 recently. My two assistants are
self-employed, so it is important to them that we increase it.
'However, the order book for high quality fixed contract wrought iron work
is healthy, so in 1994 we shall probably concentrate increasingly on that
aspect of our work. This should help reduce the bank overdraft, currently
about half our upper limit of Pounds 15,000.'
One of Topp's recent innovations is to design and sell small furnaces for
blacksmiths to use as adjuncts to their forges. These allow smiths to heat
several bars at once so they can work in rotation on each bar. They thus
save time and make forge work cheaper and more competitive.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Gentleman's agreement
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
During the past two or three years, I have lent my eldest son a lot of money
to help with his business. We have a gentleman's agreement without formal
documentation. It is unlikely, however, that he will be able to repay me in
full for many years, possibly not in my lifetime.
My will leaves all my possessions to my wife. If she dies before me, they
are to be shared equally between my two sons. Does my son have to declare
the loan as income? Should I declare it as a gift? Are there implications
for income and inheritance tax?
Although no documentation was drawn up, a contract of loan still exists, and
you might now wish to document the terms as evidence of what was agreed
orally at an earlier date. No income tax implications arise for either you
or your sons. You receive no taxable interests; your son received the money
as capital.
For IHT purposes, the loan is not a gift. Your estate still has the right to
receive the money back. This right will be valued as part of your estate at
death and it will be inherited by your successors.
In the event that it is inherited by your sons, one half of the principal
amount will still be owed by one brother to the other. Given the
circumstances of the loan (ie, it is unlikely that it can be repaid on
demand), the value of the right received by you when you made the loan
originally is probably lower than the actual money lent.
The diminution in the valuation of your estate is a 'transfer' for IHT. I
consider this to be a potentially exempt transfer (PET) which might become
taxable if you die within seven years of making the loan. Alternatively, if
it is not a PET, it could be within the Pounds 150,000 nil rate band.
As your son repays the loan, this has no inheritance consequences for him.
It reduces the value to your estate of the right to receive the balance of
the principal outstanding.
If you wish to write off any part of the principal outstanding, the waiver
must be effected by a deed. Informal waivers (ie, by letter) are not
effective for tax purposes. A waiver constitutes a potentially exempt
transfer on each occasion one is made.
If you were to survive for seven years from the date of the transfer, then
no IHT will be payable at all and it would not affect your nil rate band. If
you were to die within the seven-year period, then the transfer could fall
within the nil rate band in any event.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: They're worried that I might die
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I run a family investment portfolio in which several members have invested
Pounds 3,000 each. Not surprisingly, some are worried they might lose their
money should I die. I have thought of three options, although each has
flaws:
1. To draw up a will. The trouble is, each time somebody cashes in their
unit or invests more money, I would need to prepare a new will and have it
witnessed.
2. To write out IOUs. These would not be ideal, though, as the value of the
portfolio changes from day to day. Besides which, would they have any
'legal' effect?
3. To issue certificates in the same way as unit trusts. Again, though, I am
concerned over the legality question and how exactly to proceed.
As I understand it, family members give you money to invest on their behalf.
You buy the shares (or other investment property) in your own name but,
presumably, keep a record of how much each family member contributes. In
effect, therefore, you own the shares as trustee for the various family
members.
The shares are not your property, although your name might be on the
certificates. Consequently, you cannot include in your will any provision
for the disposal/distribution of the portfolio investment, as a will can
provide only for the devolution of your own property.
It appears to me that, since what exists here is a trust, you should draw up
mutually-agreed written terms for its operation, including what will happen
on your death. This can be done quite informally so long as the written
constitution states clearly the intentions of the investors.
One suggestion is for the constitution to provide that, on your death, an
appointed person realises the investment assets in your name and that the
proceeds be distributed to the family members in proportion to the amounts
they have invested. Any contribution of your own into the portfolio remains
your own property; nevertheless, it can remain part of the trust property
with yourself as trustee and your estate as beneficiary. The above
suggestion deals with this situation.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: A mystery explained - Bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DYSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trading Eurobonds is a major part of the way institutional investors operate
but, contrary to popular belief, the market does not exist purely for their
benefit.
As Eurobonds offer some of the best yields available, every investor should
consider them. To prove anyone can acquire them, I visited the City branches
of several large clearing banks and asked their share-dealing services if I
could buy, and hold, a Eurobond through them.
They did not make it easy - but the problem seems to be that few people know
what a Eurobond is, let alone how to deal in one.
Bonds are simply a loan from the investor, in return for which there is
normally a fixed rate of interest and a fixed repayment date. In the
meantime, the loan can be bought and sold in the same manner as shares. The
most common example is UK government bonds, or gilts.
The prefix 'Euro' originated late in the 1950s when eastern European
countries transferred large amounts of dollars from American to European
banks. In 1993, Pounds 21bn worth of new issues were launched in sterling
alone, approximately 10 times as much as non-Eurobond issues.
Eurobonds trade in bearer form: that is, the share certificates are like
cash and the holder of the bond is assumed to be the owner. Each certificate
has coupons attached representing the interest payments; these must be
removed and presented for payment.
With a weekly turnover of more than Dollars 100bn, it is not practical - or
safe - for each buyer and seller to exchange their certificates in person.
Most stockbrokers overcome this by settling via one of the two main Eurobond
clearing houses - Euroclear (Brussels) and CEDEL (Luxembourg)  - but there
are charges for doing so. Eurobond dealing and handling charges generally
are higher than for gilts, but the impact on yields declines with larger
orders.
All bond markets have seen extreme turbulence recently; as a result, bonds
have produced negative returns of up to 8 per cent in 1994. The positive
side is that income-seekers can achieve high yield levels that have not been
available for months.

market-maker and cannot deal with private clients direct. Readers interested
in buying bonds should approach a broker.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Options blow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An Inland Revenue statement this week could be bad news for globe-trotting
executives with lucrative share options. Fleeing the country will no longer
guarantee the tax-free status of option profits. But if the right steps are
taken before the option is first granted, the taxman's net can still be
avoided.
The exercise of an option by a director or employee generally will result in
a demand for income tax under section 135 of the 1988 Taxes Act. This is
levied on the amount by which the then value of the shares exceeds their
cost.
The strict legal position is that if an executive is resident in the UK when
he is granted the option, his exercise will be caught by section 135 - even
if he is no longer living there at the time. In practice, the Revenue has
taken a much more lenient view. For many years, its stated policy was: 'If
the director or employee has ceased to be resident in the UK at the time he
exercises the option, the question of a charge will not normally arise.'
Three years ago, the Revenue decided to re-define 'normally' in a way which
pointed the section 135 pistol at the heads of most expatriate
option-holders. This week, the full U-turn was completed as what remained of
the Revenue's concessionary treatment was withdrawn for options exercised on
or after April 6.
Since the letter of the law clearly backs the Revenue, any attempt to resist
a tax demand on option profits will be futile. Remaining abroad with all
your assets might stop the tax being collected - but that is hardly
satisfactory. The only real escape route will be for options to be granted
under an 'approved' share scheme.
The benefit of Revenue approval is that the section 135 tax charge generally
will be avoided. Hence, the executive's only potential liability would be
CGT when, ultimately, he sold the shares - and non-residents are exempt from
CGT.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: CGT and indexation . . . - In this,
the second of a series on capital gains tax, Richard Chant and Alan Sugden
deal with indexation and how to match sales of a security with purchases
made at different times after March 31 1982
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD CHANT and ALAN SUGDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The purpose of indexation
In order to avoid charging CGT on that element of a realised gain caused by
inflation since March 1982, the cost of securities acquired after March 31
of that year is indexed by the change in the retail price index from the
month of purchase or acquisition to the month of disposal.
(Note that the month of purchase is the month of the contract's date, not
the settlement date).
Calculation of indexation using factors
The Inland Revenue issues a monthly table of indexation factors. These apply
to the original cost of a holding sold in that month.
For example, its January 1994 table (not shown here) gave a factor of 0.665
for June 1983. Thus, if shares bought for Pounds 1,000 in June 1983 were
sold in January 1994, the calculation needed to work out the indexed cost
would be: Pounds 1,000 + (Pounds 1,000 x 0.665) Pounds 665 = Pounds 1,665.
An alternative and simpler indexation tool is provided in Table 1. By adding
1 to all the factors published by the Revenue, the FT allows you to cut the
calculation down.
Simply multiply the original cost by the adjusted factor: ie, 1.665. So,
Pounds 1,000 x 1.665 = Pounds 1,665.
Where to find the factors
A table of adjusted CGT indexation allowances is published each month -
usually on the last Saturday - in the Weekend FT. These cover allowances for
the previous month. Those for January 1994 were published on February 26.
(See Table 1).
Calculation of indexation factors
The indexation factor is calculated like this. Take the retail price index
(RPI) in the month of disposal and subtract the RPI in March 1982 (or the
actual month acquired, if later). Divide the resulting figure by the RPI in
March 1982 (or the actual month acquired, if later).
Here, for example, is how to work out the factor for the sale of an asset
acquired in June 1983 and sold in January 1994, using the RPIs from Table 2:
RPI January 1994 - RPI June 1983 / RPI June 1983 gives you (141.3 - 84.8)
56.5 / 84.8 = 0.66627. Rounded to the nearest third decimal place, this
would give 0.666.
The difference between this and the published factor of 0.665 is due to the
published RPI figures being themselves rounded.
Calculation of indexation using RPI
Alternatively, you can use the monthly RPIs, which are produced by the
government statistical service and published widely in the financial press.
Each year, for instance, Accountancy magazine produces a complete table of
RPIs going back to 1915, and this is updated each month in the FT table.
(See Table 2).
In our example above, taking the RPIs for June 1983 (84.8) and January 1994
(141.3) from Table 2, the calculation is quite simple. The indexed cost =
original cost x RPI for the month of sale / RPI for the month of purchase -
or Pounds 1,000 x 141.3 / 84.8 = Pounds 1,666.
Either method (factor or RPI) is acceptable to the Inland Revenue providing
it is consistent. In other words, you must stick to one method all the time.
A great advantage of using the RPI is that you need only one table of RPIs
rather than a factor table for each month.
What happens when the RPI is static or falling
If the RPI for the month of disposal is the same or less than the RPI for
the month of acquisition (or the RPI for March 1982 if acquired pre-March 31
1982), then indexation would be nil. (That is, there is no 'negative
indexation' if the RPI falls).
Share pooling for stock acquired after April 5 1982
Where you add to your existing holding of a security, and all your previous
purchases have been later than April 5 1982, your total holding of that
security is treated as a single asset. If you dispose of part of your
holding, the disposal is treated as a partial disposal.
Ignoring indexation for the moment, let us consider a shareholder who
invests in the ordinary 10p shares of Stakis, the Scottish-based hotel group
(see Table 3).
Stakis fell on hard times due to rapid and imprudent expansion, sometimes
into activities unrelated to its main business; it even acquired a
stockbroking firm, Robert Wigram &amp; Co., in September 1987, the month before
the market crashed. It took a change of management, the disposal of
peripheral activities and a one-for-three 'rescue' rights issue to turn the
company round.
Now let us include indexation. Table 4 shows how:
1. The cost of the original holding is indexed from the month of the
original purchase to the month of the rights issue.
2. The total cost is indexed to the month in which 4,000 shares were sold.
This is the method that Revenue legislation stipulates; a re-calculation of
the indexed cost should be made every time an 'operative event' occurs. An
operative event is any event which either increases or reduces the cost of a
holding.
This is fine if you are programming the calculation for a computer, but not
if you are a small private shareholder working it out by hand. In this case,
you can simplify the process by doing the calculation only when a disposal
takes place.
First, you either index the original cost to the date of this disposal; or,
if there has been a prior disposal from the holding, index the indexed cost
of the residual holding at the date of the last disposal to the date of this
disposal.
Then, you index the cost of each subsequent purchase from the date of
acquisition to the date of this disposal.
In our Stakis shareholder example, the shareholder has made no previous
disposals (see Table 5). We will deal with the treatment of securities
acquired before March 31 1982 in our next article.
Proposed changes to the rules on indexation
In his November Budget, the chancellor announced that for disposals made on
or after November 30 (the day after the Budget), indexation would be allowed
only to reduce or eliminate a capital gain. That is, it cannot be used to
create or increase a loss. In addition, as we mentioned last week, the
indexation of the cost of holdings of negligible value is ruled out for
negligible-value claims made after November 29, even if the Revenue had
deemed them to be of negligible value before then.
These proposals are contained in the Finance Bill now going through
Parliament and are not expected to be altered.
Payment for shares by instalment - acquisition date
If you subscribe for an issue of shares and pay for them by instalments,
indexation of their cost is calculated as follows:
1. For privatisation issues: from the date you acquire the shares.
2. For other issues: (a) If all instalments are payable within a 12-month
period, from the date by which the first payment has to be made; (b) If
payments are spread over more than 12 months, from the date by which each
instalment had to be paid.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Bad bets that threaten us all -
Diary of a Private Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Suppose you went into a clothing shop expecting to buy some garments but
found only people looking at computer screens. The manager says: 'We can't
sell you any clothes. Perhaps, though, you might like to gamble on the price
of jeans going up over the next month or so? Or maybe you would like a bet
on the direction of heating costs for garment manufacturers?'
You protest: 'I just want a designer silk waistcoat, small-sized. I believe
it will be a good investment and will serve me well for years.'
'Ah,' replies the manager. 'we cannot provide such things any more. But
perhaps you might like to give us some money and let our computerised
trading system invest in a wide range of waistcoats, including one or two
made of silk - although, to be honest, a few probably will fall to pieces.
You won't be able to handle any of the garments, either, as we keep them to
sell - some sight unseen - to other traders.'
If you asked the manager why he no longer sold clothes direct to the public,
he might tell you: 'Well, it's such a bother. People have got to actually
make the clothes, transport them to us, and then we have to hand them
physically to customers. By trading in all these other things instead, we
can do everything electronically, at the touch of a button, and it's much
more profitable for us.'
All this might seem rather ridiculous - but replace 'garment' and
'waistcoat' with 'direct shareholding in a small manufacturing company' and
the comparisons with today's financial markets become more obvious.
Recently, I tried to increase my shareholding in a small, well-managed
company. Only 10,000 shares were available, though, and it proved impossible
to buy any more even though I was willing to pay more than the supposed
market price for them.
It appears that I have become old-fashioned. Over the years, I have made
respectable profits by investing in small companies that actually made
something - companies that I saw as having particular strengths and likely
to grow. The thing is, I bought shares only after a certain amount of
personal research and investigation. Now, it is the fashion to let others
make the investment decisions and, increasingly, shares in companies are
being bought because they happen to be in a particular index.
The derivatives market, too, has increased dramatically its influence over
the share prices of many companies. Last year in the UK, more than Pounds
9bn was poured into unit trusts. There are now so many that choosing between
them is even more difficult than deciding on an individual company's shares.
Investment trusts also have multiplied. At one time, many seemed a 'bargain'
because their shares stood at a discount to their net asset value. But I
suspect that many investors who bought these just a few years ago will be
surprised if they turn to the FT's share price pages. It is amazing how many
of these trusts now have a premium rating, being valued at more than their
assets.
I have nothing against unit and investment trusts. A number have produced an
excellent performance, more than tripling their investors' money over five
years. Equally, some have performed very badly, turning Pounds 1,000 into
less than Pounds 900 after five years. It is examples like these that make
me want to continue making my own, direct investment decisions in individual
companies.
Even when I find a company which I think is undervalued, however, its share
price still can be clobbered by institutional investors switching out of it
 -not because they dislike its management or prospects but because a
short-term computer program made them do it. Or because it has been pushed
out of an index, perhaps by a 'bubble' company that has grown larger because
of hype and over-expectation.
Even more scary is the increasingly powerful influence on the market of
financial derivatives. Again, I have nothing against trading in options and
futures, particularly when it is used as a hedge to protect exposure to
foreign currencies and a variety of commodities. But it seems to me that too
many people are now treating these markets like casinos. For every bank that
announces huge profits on its dealings in derivatives, someone, somewhere,
must have made correspondingly large losses.
The amount of money 'trading' on foreign exchange markets world-wide each
day has been calculated to be considerably more than the value of world
trade. And, in a number of countries, exposure to dealings in derivatives
does not have to be revealed to regulatory authorities.
The next stock market crash could well be triggered by dealings in
derivatives: people making too many wrong bets that a share index will rise
or fall or that the price of a currency, commodity, bonds, or a combination
of financial instruments will perform in a particular way.
Surely the time is approaching fast when people ought to stand back from
these markets and re-evaluate where they - and their countries - are going.
What future is there for a nation's industry when it is easier for people to
bet on a possibility - something that cannot even be touched - than it is
for a private investor to buy shares in a small company that makes something
people want to buy?

Charges: At present life office illustrations of what your investment may
produce use a standard basis for charges set by Lautro (the Life Assurance
and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation). To reveal the impact of real
charges on the final fund of Standard Life's managed unit-linked plan, we
asked for illustrations using actual charges for a man age 45 who expects to
retire at age 65 (ie, a 20-year contract), paying (a) Pounds 200 per month
and (b) a stand alone single premium of Pounds 10,000.
Illustrations using Lautro standard charges, which in fact are lower than
those used by most life offices, are shown in brackets. The last
illustration gives a theoretical value if no charges were deducted.

 ---------------------------------------------------------
As can be seen, where full commission is paid, Standard Life's charges are
significantly higher than the Lautro basis, yielding a lower projected
return. When the commission cost is stripped out, the reverse is true on the
monthly premium plan at the higher growth rate but elsewhere Standard Life's
charges are still higher than the Lautro basis. The life office's charges
are above the industry average on regular and single premium unit-linked
contracts for virtually all investment periods but are lower than average on
longer term with-profits contracts.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Why Standard slipped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Standard Life, founded in 1825, is the largest mutual insurer in Europe and,
arguably, one of the most successful. It is also one of the biggest
providers of personal pension plans, with just under 500,000 sold since
1988.
Its financial credentials include a top rating of AAA from both Standard &amp;
Poor's and the other main US rating agency, Moody's Investors Services.
Continuity of investment staff is good and it has a tradition of strong,
conservative investment performance over the long term. But recent results
have been mixed.
The managed unit-linked fund is one of the largest on the market at Pounds
2,3bn, and clients with a regular premium contract will have seen returns
just above average over five years and just below average over 10. Where a
single premium investment was selected, the same fund shows consistently
above-average returns, reflecting the lower charges and commissions
associated with these contracts.
The main managed fund invests in several funds, including property, but the
managed 'stock exchange' fund excludes property. Both had below-average
returns in 1993, although they began to rally early this year.
Alan Goodman, assistant general manager for marketing, says: 'After several
years of good stock selections and a favourable bias towards UK investment,
the managed fund suffered from the effective devaluation of sterling
following its withdrawal from the ERM (exchange rate mechanism) in September
1992.
'Moreover, from late 1992 and for most of 1993, overseas equities performed
better than the UK market. The managed fund was underweight in this area
compared with other funds.'
Several of the society's funds reveal a peak in 1991/92 followed by relative
decline. The UK equity fund, also one of the largest in its sector with
Pounds 1,745m under management, achieved top quartile (top 25 per cent)
results over a rolling five-year period. But a closer look reveals a peak
performance in 1991, followed by below-average returns for 1993. The same
holds for the European and North American funds. Equally volatile are funds
earmarked for a lower risk approach.
The cash fund dropped to the bottom quartile in the year to February 1 1994
but maintains an above-average return over five years. The fixed-interest
fund peaked in 1991 and 1992 but dropped to the bottom quartile in the year
to February 1 1994, while the with-profits fund returned below-average
performance for virtually every investment period.
Standard Life sells 80 per cent of its products through Independent
Financial Advisers and 20 per cent through direct sales and tied agents but
recently split from its most important tied agent, the Halifax building
society. And while Standard's rates of commission to IFAs are average for
the industry, its charges are comparatively high.
On regular premium plans, you pay a 5 per cent initial charge (bid/offer
spread). There is an annual investment management charge of 0.875 per cent,
plus an extra annual charge of 1.5 per cent on all units bought during the
first two years. This extra charge is levied for up to 25 years on these
units although it is waived where the adviser does not take commission.
There is no initial charge on single premiums but there is a monthly service
charge of Pounds 3.05 on all contracts.
The society has been a major player in the transfer market, with around
66,500 plans sold to employees who have transferred their benefits to a
personal pension; this represents about 14 per cent of sales. But in 1992 it
suspended transfer business from tied agents while checks were carried out
on sales techniques. Goodman says: 'The entire advice process is reviewed
before any application is acted upon.'

Henry is 40 and works for a merchant bank in the City of London; it pays him
Pounds 70,000 a year. On April 6, he will hand back his present company car,
a one-year-old Rover Sterling with a list price of Pounds 27,795 and take
delivery of a new BMW 525i SE costing Pounds 25,850.
Four years ago he married Fiona, an art teacher now aged 33 and earning
Pounds 15,000; she also has freelance income of about Pounds 1,000 a year.
They have no children.
Henry has stock exchange investments worth Pounds 90,000, in which he deals
fairly actively. Fiona's parents gave her Pounds 100,000 when she married
(although nothing since), which was invested in a house which she owns
jointly with Henry.
He is feeling pleased with his financial acumen as he has:
Transferred investments to Fiona, which she sold in 1993/94 and realised
gains of Pounds 3,000 tax-free. (He has used his own CGT allowance already.)
Persuaded Fiona's parents that they should use their IHT exemptions and each
give her Pounds 6,000 before April 6.
Persuaded the managing director to order him to drive to Scotland to see a
client late this month: this will bring his business mileage to more than
2,500.
Henry calculates he has saved the couple Pounds 1,200 in CGT by giving the
investments to Fiona. By driving more than 2,500 business
miles in 1993-94, he has reduced the tax on his car by Pounds 1,242 (40 per
cent of Pounds 9,315 minus Pounds 6,210).
He expects he will drive more than 2,500 miles on business in his BMW next
year, too. The new benefit value for 1994-95 will be Pounds 6,032, rather
than the Pounds 6,210 scale charge for the Rover in 1993-94.
With almost Pounds 2,442 in hand for the present year and more in the bush
for next, Henry is in the mood to celebrate. He plans to take Fiona for a
weekend in Gleneagles while they decide how to spend it.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Plan to slash your tax bill - The
best ways to make the most of your allowances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW RADICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every year, the Treasury collects a multi-million pound bonus from taxpayers
who do not make full use of allowances and reliefs to which they are
entitled. The main areas in which you can reduce your tax bill are:
Income tax
Everyone has a personal allowance of at least Pounds 3,445 for the 1993/94
tax year (more for older taxpayers). On top of this, the first Pounds 2,500
is taxed at 20 per cent and the next Pounds 21,200 at 25 per cent; above
this, you are in the 40 per cent bracket. Families should make sure
income-producing assets are in the right hands to take maximum advantage of
allowances and the 20 and 25 per cent rate bands.
Married couples can elect - on form 17, obtainable from their local tax
office - for income from jointly-held property to be divided between husband
and wife in accordance with their beneficial interests in the property. This
election is effective only from the date the form is signed, however, so it
is worth thinking about now for 1994/95.
A word of warning on gifts to children: if a parent puts capital into trust
for a child, only the first Pounds 100 of income is regarded as the child's
for tax purposes; the rest is treated as that of the parent. But if a
grandparent puts capital into trust for a grandchild, the income is the
child's for tax purposes (this is also good inheritance tax planning).
The tax relief on the married couple's allowance (Pounds 1,720) is worth
only 20 per cent in 1994/95, so it will not be worth transferring this to
the wife unless the husband's income is below the threshold. Couples for
whom this transfer will be an advantage should get a form 18 from the
Revenue and return it by April 5.
Married couples with a joint mortgage have until April 5 to elect for the
interest paid in the 1992/93 tax year and thereafter to be allocated between
them in whatever proportion they choose. Normally, this is the only way in
which you can get tax relief on a second mortgage.
If they do not make this election, the interest is divided equally between
them. But, unlike Miras, this interest attracts relief at the top marginal
rate of tax of the person to whom it is allocated. This can make a very
considerable difference to a couple where one spouse pays tax at 40 per cent
and the other at 20 or 25 per cent.
If you have had a bank deposit of Pounds 50,000 or more which pays interest
gross for a number of years, it might well be to your advantage to close it
and re-open it by April 5. Your tax assessment for the 1993/94 tax year
(which you should have paid on January 1) will have been based on the
interest credited to your account in 1992/93. If you close your account now,
your assessment for 1993/94 will instead be based on the interest credited
in 1993/94. Because of the sharp fall in interest rates over the period, you
should get a repayment of tax.
You do, however, need also to look at your tax assessment for 1992/93, which
will be based on the interest credited in 1991/92. If you close your
account, the Revenue could revise the 1992/93 assessment to the amount you
actually received in 1992/93. Since interest rates generally were lower in
1992/93 than 1991/92, the Revenue normally will not seek to revise the
1992/93 assessment. But you should look at the facts of your own case before
acting.
The scope for employees to reduce their tax bills is limited. It is worth
bearing in mind that the tax drops by a third if you drive more than 2,500
business miles in your company car by April 5. If your employer is unwilling
to send you on the necessary business trip, you could remind him that his
own National Insurance contribution on your car also goes down by a third.
If you are considering paying additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) into
a pension scheme, do so by April 5 if you want tax relief against your
income for 1993/94. If, however, you expect your income to rise considerably
in the next tax year and you will pay tax at 40 per cent rather than 25,
then it could make sense to defer payment of the AVCs until after April 5.
The contributions will be invested in the fund for almost as long and they
will have enjoyed tax relief at a higher rate.
Contributors to personal pension plans should also look at their position
before April 5. This is the last day for paying a premium which is to be
treated as paid in the 1992/93 tax year, so reducing the tax bill for that
year. Any relief still unused from 1987/88 will no longer be available after
that date.
Capital gains tax
You will know more after March 26 when you have finished reading the Weekend
FT series by Richard Chant and Alan Sugden. But there will be only five
working days left in the tax year after then, so here are some points for
those who want to act now.
Everyone has a tax-free CGT allowance of Pounds 5,800 for the tax year
1993/94; this cannot be carried forward. Investors should aim to bed and
breakfast (ie, sell and re-purchase) shares which are showing gains, thus
using up the allowance and increasing the cost to be used in future sales.
Transfers of assets between husbands and wives are tax-free. Since CGT is
payable at an investor's top marginal rate of income tax, it makes sense
first to use both spouses' allowances of Pounds 5,800 and then to route
sales through the spouse with the lower rate of tax.
You should take care to ensure that the paperwork is in order if you are
thinking of transferring assets before sale. In particular, the sale
proceeds should not find their way back to the spouse who is supposed to
have given them away.
If you are already over the CGT threshold for 1993/94 and are about to sell
an asset with a large gain, doing this after April 5 means you will defer
payment of the tax until December 1 1995. Also, if you are over the
threshold, consider if you can reduce your bill by making a negligible value
claim before April 5.
Inheritance tax
This is levied at 40 per cent on a person's estate on death although the
first Pounds 150,000 is exempt. You can reduce your estate by giving away
assets; providing you live seven years afterwards, no IHT will be due on
them. You can also give away up to Pounds 3,000 each tax year and the gift
will be entirely tax-free; if you do not use up this allowance in a year,
the unused part is carried forward for another year.
In addition, you can give away up to Pounds 250 each year to as many people
as you like. Thus, if you did not make any gifts in 1992/93, you can give
away up to Pounds 6,000 by April 5 this year; this will be ignored for IHT
purposes. Bear in mind, however, that CGT is payable on gifts of portfolio
investments to your children.
Value added tax
Unless you are planning to move house, pre-pay domestic electricity and gas
bills before the 8 per cent VAT is introduced on April 1.
Investments
You can put up to Pounds 9,000 each tax year into personal equity plans  -
Pounds 6,000 into a general Pep and Pounds 3,000 into a single company Pep.
Income and capital gains are tax-free, so the only charges are those of the
fund manager.
Other tax-free products include National Savings certificates; the 41st
issue pays 5.40 per cent, which is equivalent to 9 per cent gross for a 40
per cent taxpayer.
Remember . . .
If you were not sent a tax return for 1992/93, but had a new source of gross
income or a capital gain on which tax is due, make sure to tell the Revenue
by April 5 to avoid a penalty.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Putting people first - Cripps
Harries Hall, seventh in a series on fee-based advisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOANNA SLAUGHTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lawyers may not be everyone's idea of sympathetic independent financial
advisers but David Lough, once a merchant banker, argues that solicitor
firms can bring special qualities to investment and financial management.
Lough's own experience appears to support this view. In 1988, he set up the
finance and investment services division of Cripps Harries Hall, a solicitor
based in Tunbridge Wells, Kent. It now has 21 staff, 600 investment clients
and Pounds 76m under managment.
Lough, a client of Cripps Harries Hall before he joined the staff, says he
'saw an opening for a firm that could draw together all the strands of a
person's affairs.' His division - which provides pension, mortgage and
insurance services as well as investment and cash management - is staffed
entirely by financial and investment specialists. None is a solicitor.
According to Lough, the operation aims at 'stewardship of a family's money,'
and he feels solicitor firms are ideal for providing this. They start from
the right ethical platform, having always disclosed commissions; they handle
client money, but their regulatory armour is all but bullet-proof; and they
can integrate a client's legal and tax affairs with his financial planning.
Lough went to Cripps Harries Hall from County NatWest, where he was managing
director throughout the deregulation dramas of the 1986 Big Bang. 'I didn't
really enjoy it that much,' he says, 'although it was a real crucible of
learning. But, at the end of the day, you were dealing with basis points for
institutions. It is more fun dealing with things that matter for people.'
His private clients are a diverse bunch; they include investment bankers and
the directors of top 100 companies as well as retired bank managers and
teachers. There is no minimum investment requirement although, if people
have less than around Pounds 50,000 in investable assets, they are advised
to opt for a series of four or five investment trusts. He says: 'We explain
that they are paying the investment trusts to manage the assets for them.'
Charges normally are on a fixed scale. Three-quarters of the clients opt for
discretionary investment management, the fee for which is 0.6 per cent a
year on the first Pounds 400,000, 0.25 per cent on the next Pounds 400,000,
and 0.125 per cent after that. Minimum charge is Pounds 595.
Each client has an individual portfolio, even for personal equity plans.
When they receive their twice-yearly valuations, the performance achieved on
their behalf is measured against a composite benchmark, which is matched to
their investment aims.
Lough is cautious about investing. He says: 'We are not right for someone
who wants trading-based service and who wants to be in and out of the
account. Our emphasis is very much on the long term. And our clients quite
like the fact that we are naturally prudent, conservative investment
managers. If they had an enormous risk appetite, they probably wouldn't come
to us.'
Unsurprisingly, therefore, the investment management successes have been
with solid companies such as BAA, Marks and Spencer and Shell. House-builder
Berkeley also has produced 'wonderful results' for CHH clients with large
portfolios. On the other hand, British Steel has proved a disappointment.
Lough says: 'I have come to the conclusion that it is just too political an
industry.'
He adds: 'Private clients judge you by a subtle series of values, such as
whether you are efficient in your administration; whether you have taken the
trouble to understand their position; and whether staff are helpful on the
telephone. You can lose your client's trust very quickly if you make
mistakes. They will think you are a shoddy operation and they are quite
right.'
He encourages clients to visit Tunbridge Wells for a first meeting 'so they
can see the set-up and the people. This is very much a team approach.' By no
means everyone arrives with their affairs in order, though. Sometimes,
detective work is needed to establish a new client's capital gains tax
position. One even arrived with a suitcase stuffed with share certificates.
'He had no idea what they were worth,' says Lough. 'Actually, it was more
than Pounds 500,000.'
Cripps Harries Hall cites provision of comprehensive financial and
investment services as a major point of difference between itself and many
other solicitor firms. But Lough believes the time is coming when solicitors
generally 'will have to decide whether they are willing for stockbrokers to
take over a client's investment affairs, or whether they are going to go
full tilt at it themselves. So far, it has been firms in large provincial
towns and cities, with big retired populations, that have acted.'
There are undoubted signs that the role of solicitor firms as investment
managers for private clients has revived in recent years; indeed, Lough
chairs the Association of Solicitor Investment Managers, which was founded
in July 1993 as a forum for such firms. To date, the association's directory
lists 17 members which, collectively, manage more than Pounds 600m of
private client money. Apparently, others are queueing to join.
Lough says: 'We formed the association because we felt there was very little
public awareness of solicitors' investment and financial services for
clients. The ethical base of solicitor firms has always been excellent. And
we believe that the firms which belong to the association add a skills base,
too.'

Fortune Oil, formerly Blackland Oil, has had a turbulent history in recent
years. The share price began to strengthen around the turn of the year but
directors have been selling over the past month. Vice-chairman Malcolm Stone
sold 4m at between 6-7p while board colleague Rupert Lycett Green has sold
1m at between 6.25-6.5p.
Philip Gwyn, chairman of Christie Group has sold 1m shares at 73.5p but
retains more than 5m. The group provides support services to businesses and
the shares stood at well over Pounds 2 in mid-1989. Although there were
losses in each of the past two years, interim results in November showed a
return to the black.
Porvair, the synthetic materials group, has made steady progress over the
past three years. Against the background of a strongly performing share
price, technical director Allen Halliwell has sold 60,000 at between
270-297p.
Floated in November, Towry Law, an integrated financial services company,
has been riding high on the back of buoyant market conditions. A director,
Clive Scott-Hopkins, has sold 150,000 shares at 217p, reducing his holding
to 445,000. Earnings are forecast to rise to 10.2p in the year to end-June
1994.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Save tax the B&amp;B way - But you must
stick to the rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rise in the stock market means many people may own shares that have
increased considerably in value. The Inland Revenue expects the number of
investors paying capital gains tax in 1993/94 to grow to 125,000 from only
85,000 in 1992/93.
Bed and breakfasting shares is one way of trying to lower the potential CGT
bill, but it can be expensive. Everyone has an annual exemption from CGT of
Pounds 5,800; by selling shares one day and buying them back the next, you
can make gains up to this limit, tax-free. Also, the shares would have a
higher base cost, which would increase the amount of indexation relief
available.
The Revenue disapproves of B&amp;B deals but is coy about telling investors what
might invalidate them for fear of giving away tax-planning advice. The
cardinal rule is that the shares must be exposed fully to the market, with
no agreement between broker and market-maker to re-purchase.
'Bed and Pepping' has also become popular, but you cannot simply transfer a
holding of shares into a personal equity plan. Its manager must have cleared
funds with which to buy shares on your behalf.
The cost of B&amp;B can be expensive compared with the potential tax saving but
many brokers waive the commission on purchases although stamp duty of 0.5
per cent has to be paid. The table below lists some of the offers.
Those with unit trusts depend on the fund manager reducing the initial
charge when the units are bought back. Each company has its own policy on
this.
There are dangers as well as costs: you are exposed to overnight
developments in world markets and could wake up to find your shares are very
expensive or, if the company is small, impossible to buy back.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Wimpey cheer - The Week Ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wimpey, the housebuilder which announces on Tuesday, has substantially
increased volume sales and will also benefit from improved margins. The
company, which in 1992 made a Pounds 112m pre-tax loss after provisions of
Pounds 113.8m, could have made a profit of about Pounds 30m last year.
English China Clays' results on Monday are likely to show a drop from Pounds
100.2m in 1992 to about Pounds 85m in 1993, including about Pounds 15m to
Pounds 20m of land sales.
Williams Holdings is expected to report annual pre-tax profits of Pounds
153m (Pounds 161m), after a Pounds 17m goodwill charge on the disposal of
the engineering businesses. Williams watchers will want indications on the
future of the electronics division, earmarked for eventual disposal.
When United Biscuits announces its full-year figures on Thursday, the chief
uncertainty is how much UB will write off in closures and restructuring at
its struggling US subsidiary, Keebler.
However, it seems that profits will be down not only in the US, but in the
UK as well. A best guess for pre-tax profit is around Pounds 170m (Pounds
162m). This allows only for exceptional events already announced. In other
words, underlying profits may be down.
Guinness, reporting on Thursday,expects pre-tax profits of Pounds 905m,
compared with an underlying Pounds 920m the year before. From that will be
deducted a Pounds 30m charge for UK pensions and a largely non-cash charge
of Pounds 173m on the LVMH transaction, leaving Pounds 702m.
Reed Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch publishing group, will announce on Thursday
its first full-year results since the merger. Analysts are forecasting
pre-tax profits of Pounds 530m.
Rentokil, the environmental and property services group, is expected to
maintain its record of 20 per cent compound growth by reporting annual
profits of about Pounds 147m on Thursday. Analysts will want a progress
report on Securiguard, the security and cleaning company which Rentokil
bought for Pounds 76m last July after a hostile takeover battle.
Legal &amp; General, the life and composite insurer, will announce its results
on Thursday. Analysts are expecting pre-tax profits to rise to about Pounds
175m, after Pounds 116m in 1992.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: New issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Beazer Homes, one of the UK's four biggest national house-builders, is being
split off from the Hanson conglomerate and floated into a buoyant stock
market sector, writes John Thornhill. The placing and public offer, arranged
by Lazard Brothers, values Beazer Homes at Pounds 463.4m. The issue price of
165p a share equates to 14.5 times historic earnings and gives a notional
gross dividend yield of 3.8 per cent. That is a modest rating relative to
the sector.
Beazer Homes has strong management, a relatively cheap land bank, and a
sound balance sheet. It will receive Pounds 50m of the flotation proceeds to
help fund its expansion programme. Its earnings growth is likely to prove
less dynamic than that produced by many other house-builders, though. The
company already has high margins and will rely chiefly on volume growth to
expand profits.
House-building is a highly cyclical industry which is in the early stages of
an up-swing. Last year, the industry had its first year of growth since
1988, with the number of new completions rising 5 per cent to 148,100. At
the last peak, in 1988, builders completed 203,000 new houses.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Selection is all when you're
thinking small - What investors should know about emerging companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR and SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Emerging companies seem likely to join emerging markets as flavour of the
year. The two stories have a lot in common. Both start with the premise that
it is intrinsically easier for a company or economy to advance rapidly if it
starts from a very low base. Just as growth in the Pacific Rim economies is
significantly faster than that in the developed economies, so a relatively
new company with a good business can often expand much faster than ICI. As
one stock market pundit put it: 'Elephants don't gallop.'
Before you get caught up in the general euphoria, however, there are four
questions to ask. Is the basic argument in favour of investing in smaller
companies sound? Is this a good moment to be buying? What are the snags? And
what are the best ways into the market?
Why buy small companies?
Over the long term, small companies as a whole have performed much better
than the giants. Look at our first chart. This tracks the smallest companies
on the main UK equity market, (the 1,279 individual companies in the Hoare
Govett Smaller Companies index) against the FT-SE-A All-Share index (which
includes the 853 biggest quoted companies).
If you go back to the mid-1950s, a modest investment of Pounds 10 in smaller
companies then would by now have grown to Pounds 890, compared with only
Pounds 300 from a similar investment in the All-Share. This does not mean
that buying tiddlers always pays. In some years the giants prevail,
particularly when markets as a whole are going through a bad patch, such as
the mid-1970s, late '80s and early '90s. Last year, though, the smaller
companies came through strongly and have continued to hold up so far in
1994.
Our second chart takes the FT-SE small cap index (which is roughly
comparable to the the Hoare Govett index) and tracks it against the FT-SE
100 index of corporate giants.
Very broadly, small companies tend to flourish when the economy is expanding
but are more vulnerable than large ones when recession bites. Not all
individual small companies exemplify this pattern, though, either long term
or short term; early this decade, they seemed to be dying like flies. And
even when the index is doing well, there will always be enormous variations
between the performance of individual companies.
Reasons for the growth in profits and share prices also vary. What investors
like most - because it will give them long-term outperformance - are small
companies with a simple, profitable formula that can provide above-average
growth for several years.
Peter Lynch, who built up Fidelity's best-known mutual fund, Magellan,
called such shares 'tenbaggers' - those with the potential to give tenfold
returns. But, in the recent smaller company boom, many of the strongest
performances have come from companies which nearly went bust but survived to
fight another day.
The first of our individual company charts shows what happened to an
acquisitive little textile company called Hartstone, which looked like a
real growth story - at least a fivebagger - but ultimately came unstuck. The
second chart shows how jewellery company Signet, the former Ratners, clawed
its way back from the brink.
Conclusion: although small companies as a whole have done better
historically than larger ones, there are periods in which they do worse  -
and many individual companies fail to conform to the norm. So, it is helpful
to buy at the right time and essential to invest in the right companies.
Is this a good time to buy?
Most pundits reckon small companies are unlikely to produce such strong
relative share price performance this year as last. The shares are starting
to look very highly priced already when measured against their actual
earnings although earnings should grow strongly.
One argument from enthusiasts is that UK markets are repeating the pattern
already set by US markets - and US smaller companies have outperformed by
some 40 per cent since they bottomed late in 1990. So, UK smaller companies,
which have outperformed by a paltry 30 per cent since they touched bottom
late in 1992, must have further potential. Well, maybe.
An alternative argument is that even if British smaller companies have
nearly run out of puff, there is still scope in smaller companies overseas.
European economic recovery is relatively immature. On this analysis, the
American small company boom is pretty mature, the British one ripe but with
a bit further to go, and the European one just on the launching pad.
What are the snags?
Anyone who owned smaller company shares late in 1987 will not need reminding
that smaller companies can be illiquid. This innocuous-sounding word means
you cannot always buy when you want to (or not without moving the price
against yourself) and you cannot always sell when you want to - at any
price. In addition, the gap between buying and selling prices - the spread -
could be much wider than it would be with a large company. This means your
shares must rise further before you can genuinely notch up a profit.
Some fund managers are already finding it hard to buy as many shares as they
want in companies they like. But others argue that the stream of attractive
new issues is alleviating this problem.
How should you invest?
Your can either invest directly in smaller company shares, or buy a smaller
company unit or investment trust. If you are an experienced, knowledgeable
and sensible investor, smaller company shares are one area where the private
individual is not necessarily at a disadvantage to the professionals.
Many readers may prefer to use a unit or investment trust although, often,
these have done substantially worse than the index. Existing funds and those
with a finite pool of money to manage probably have an edge over new or
expanding ones. Management groups with a traditional emphasis on
stock-picking should also have an advantage.
The consistently highest-performing funds with a three-year track record,
according to Fund Research, are (unit trusts): Hill Samuel UK Emerging Cos;
Thornton UK Smaller Cos, Royal Life UK Emerging Cos; Lazard UK Smaller Cos
Growth; Britannia Life Smaller Cos; (investment trusts): Murray Enterprise;
Aberforth Smaller Cos; Smaller Cos (Abtrust); Throgmorton Trust; and
Moorgate.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Markets: Bond investors let their hearts rule - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
During the bull cycle in financial assets, between 1990 and 1993, the US
stock market happily trailed along behind a booming bond market. When bond
prices rose, so did share prices. This made sense. Higher bond prices meant
lower long-term interest rates.
Lower rates were both good for the struggling economy, because they cut the
cost of capital for companies and loans for consumers, and good for share
prices, because they made stocks look more attractive relative to
fixed-income securities.
However, now that the bulls have deserted bonds, and long-term interest
rates are speedily rising, the stock market is struggling to unhitch its
wagon from a panicking bond market.
This is not to say that the stock market should ignore the bond market's
decline. Since October, long-term interest rates (as measured by the yield
on the benchmark 30-year government bond) have risen more than 100 basis
points - from just below 5.8 per cent to 6.95 per cent.
Stock market investors are right to be worried by this sharp increase in
rates, because higher rates threaten the economy's health by raising the
cost of borrowing for corporations and consumers. They also make equities
look potentially less attractive compared to other assets. Just as
important, the stock market should be concerned if the bond market's losses
have been prompted by signs of steadily rising inflation. Inflation, as the
economists keep repeating, is the enemy of financial markets.
But - and it is a big 'but' - short- and medium-term interest rates, even
with the recent increases in bond yields, remain low by historical
standards. Also, little evidence exists that the recent growth in US
economic activity has been stoking the inflationary fires. If anything, the
long-term outlook for inflation is surprisingly bright.
Unfortunately, bond market investors are allowing their hearts to rule their
heads. And investors in stocks, rattled by the big increase in long-term
interest rates, are proving equally fickle.
This week, the markets were so shaky that two unsubstantiated rumours about
the Whitewater affair contributed to a sharp, and panicky, decline in bond
prices. First, a Washington DC political newsletter reported congressional
gossip that the body of Vince Foster - the aide to President Clinton who
committed suicide last year - had been moved from an apartment to the
Virginia park where it was later discovered.
Second, a newswire service reported that Hillary Clinton had invested money
in a hedge fund that later benefited from shorting US pharmaceutical stocks.
This report attracted a lot of attention because the president's wife has
been playing a key role in drawing up plans for a reform of the country's
healthcare system, plans that have hit the share prices of big drug
companies.
There was little evidence at the time to back up either story, but the
financial markets are so nervous that both reports, combined with
revelations about the allegedly improper actions of White House staff over
investigations into the Whitewater matter, badly spooked already jumpy bond
market investors. Or, at least, that was what traders were saying on
Thursday, when the 30-year bond fell 1 1/4 points. The sharp drop in bond
prices, inevitably, sparked a sell-off in the stock market.
Amid the smokescreen sent up by the Whitewater affair, the rumours of
skulduggery in the White House, and the growing fears - justified or
otherwise - of returning inflation, there is an important truth. The
financial markets, after three years of unprecedented prosperity, are having
to adjust to a new environment. And that adjustment is proving painful.
At least some of the pain in the stock market is being alleviated by a
continued revival in the mergers and acquisitions business, which has been
keeping share prices in certain key industry sectors - including, banking,
telecommunications and media - buoyant.
This week it was the turn of the defence sector to reap the rewards of a
highly-publicised takeover move. On Monday, Martin Marrietta announced an
agreed Dollars 55-a-share bid for Long Island defence contractor Grumman.
Three days later, Northrop, another defence group, upped the stakes by
offering Dollars 60 per share for Grumman.
The news had a dramatic impact on Grumman's share price which, over six
trading days, climbed 75 per cent. The stock now stands at around Dollars
64, which implies that the market expects the bidding war to escalate. A
month after the furious battle for control of Paramount Communications
ended, the stock market has another contested takeover on its hands.

Beleaguered Euro Disney this week edged closer to a Pounds 1.3bn rescue
deal. The European leisure group and Walt Disney, its US parent, are
understood to have mapped out a restructuring plan with Euro Disney's banks.
The hope is that an outline rescue can be agreed before the March 31
deadline imposed by Disney for continuing to support Euro Disney. The
American company is understood to be willing to extend its support beyond
the deadline if the banks agree in principle to the rescue package.

boosted last year - At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust's share price rose by 40 per cent during
1993, while net assets grew 31 per cent, the company announced this week.
The trust had net assets of Pounds 1.56bn at the end of 1993, after a good
year on world stock markets. The total dividend for the year increased 5 per
cent to 3.52p.
The trust's share price discount to net asset value has lately been at its
narrowest since 1972, partly as a result of the popularity of the savings
scheme F &amp; C introduced 10 years ago, which has provided a steady source of
demand for shares in the trust, and has widened its shareholder base. F &amp; C
now has almost 75,000 shareholders - an increase of 32 per cent during 1993
 -and individual shareholders own 46 per cent of the trust.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Markets: A week of quiet torture in stocks - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London's equity market managed this week to do a lot of damage to itself
without making much fuss about it. In contrast to the sound and fury a week
before when stocks ended barely changed, the atmosphere was quiet and
relatively calm but the drop in prices was marked.
Its instruments of torture were mostly foreign, particularly the US and
German bond markets, although stock derivatives also played a role at home.
Any tentative rally in the cash market was aborted by a sell-off in
derivatives.
The week opened on a positive note with a one-day rise in global bond
markets buoying equities. After that it was down hill all the way. The FT-SE
100 finished the week down 86.1 points at 3,191.9.
Economic fundamentals should have been more supportive. In the UK industrial
production accelerated in January, prompting the Central Statistical Office
to raise its trend annual growth rate for production from 2.5 per cent to 3
per cent. On a negative note, though, a widening trade gap hammered shares
yesterday. In Germany, metal workers settled for tiny wage increases and
called off their planned strike. In the US, the Federal Reserve Board's
latest Beige Book of economic conditions said only 'limited price pressures'
were apparent.
But markets continue to be uneasy about the direction of interest rates on
both sides of the Atlantic and about inflation and presidential political
problems in the US.
Investors have found few havens from the volatility of recent weeks. One in
the UK has been convertibles, whether preference shares, loan stock or
Eurobonds convertible into the issuing company's ordinary shares. They offer
better yields and security than ordinary equities but at the expense of some
of the capital growth. They usually underperform a sharply rising stock
market but outperform on the way down. But in a stock market driven by
falling interest rates they have not been performing to historical patterns.
One way to track them is via Kleinwort Benson's index of the 80 largest
convertible issues by UK companies. Last year, the COSI-80 gave a total
return of 25 per cent, nearly identical to that of the Footsie but below the
34.5 per cent of the FTA Long Gilt index.
Since then, convertibles have held up well under the downward pressure on
markets. From the beginning of this year to Thursday's close, the COSI-80,
which has a market capitalisation of some Pounds 14bn, had a total return of
minus 1.1 per cent, while the Footsie's was minus 4.8 per cent and the Long
Gilt index's was minus 6.7 per cent. The convertibles' yield spreads over
gilts have narrowed sharply.
But this outperformance has left convertibles looking over-valued. Moreover,
rising dividends on ordinary stock are making the convertibles look less
attractive. Kleinwort still believes, however, there are some worth buying.
Typically they would be issued by a company with good fundamental prospects
and would offer a superior yield to the ordinary stock. Crucially, they must
be available for only a reasonable premium over the ordinary shares. Two
current examples are British Airways 9.75 per cent 2005 and Tomkins 6.25 per
cent 2013.
Convertibles, admittedly, are instruments for the aficionados. Typical
investors are institutional income funds seeking higher income with security
and some capital gains bonus on underlying stock.
'A retail investor wouldn't know to go for them,' says James Higgins of
Chamberlain de Broe, an independent financial adviser. 'They are a hang-over
from the 1980s when people bought securities for income. Those days are long
gone and people are buying now for capital growth.'
Not that capital growth was on offer in the stock market this week. Even
hefty rises in corporate earnings and dividends failed to underpin equities.
More important than the results were a string of upbeat trading statements.
Most eye-catching was BTR's. The diverse industrial group has enjoyed a
sharp improvement in outlook since its interim comments in September.
Then it said: ' . . . Continental Europe declining very rapidly . . .
evidence that the recovery is translating into significant increases in
corporate profitability is still inconclusive . . . the outlook remains
uncertain for any meaningful upturn in the second half . . .'
This week it said: 'The improvement seen in the US and Australia in the last
quarter of 1993 have been maintained, and in the UK and Continental Europe,
with the exception of Germany, recovery, albeit slow, is beginning to
emerge. BTR enters 1994 with a confident view.' And this was after ending
1993 on a high note with a 19 per cent increase in pre-tax profits and a
13.4 per cent increase in dividend.
Yesterday, SG Warburg Securities yesterday its forecasts for corporate
earnings in 1994, using BTR's contrasting statements as examples of the slow
rise in optimism. Before recent reports from 58 large companies, it had
forecast that their 1994 earnings after exceptional items would grow by an
average of 14.2 per cent. After the reports, it upped the forecast to 20.7
per cent.
Overall, this reporting season is turning out close to Warburg's
expectations. Dividend growth has averaged 8 per cent against its pre-season
forecast of 7 per cent. Earnings pre-exceptionals are up 44 per cent against
a forecast 45 per cent.
The trends were borne out by results from many big companies this week.
Highlights included: Barclays and Standard Chartered in banking; RTZ,
Laporte, Portals and British Polythene in minerals, chemicals, papers and
plastics; Lloyds in the retail sector; Hillsdown Holdings and Cadbury
Schweppes in food and drink; Hays and WPP in business services and
advertising; Rolls-Royce and TI Group in engineering.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Markets: RTZ digs deep for its dividend - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Derek Birkin, chairman of RTZ, is justly proud that the company has
never cut its dividend. This week the world's biggest mining company
surprised many in the City with an increase in the dividend for 1993 - a
year when base metals prices continued on their well-trodden downward path.
RTZ last year completed a restructuring programme, begun in 1988, which
leaves it wholly focused on mining. While Birkin spoke of the resilience of
the company to adverse market conditions, he also warned that the dividend
increase of 1p to 20.5p 'should be taken as an indicator not of the outlook
for 1994, but of our confidence in the company's potential once recovery is
soundly established.'
Since RTZ began to reorganise, average dollar non-ferrous base metal prices
have fallen 44 per cent, including last year's 15 per cent decline. At the
pre-tax level profits were down from Pounds 521m to Pounds 435m on turnover
up from Pounds 4.6bn to Pounds 4.8bn. But adjusted earnings, which are seen
as a truer reflection of the underlying performance, were ahead by 10 per
cent from Pounds 338m to Pounds 373m.
Birkin, presenting his last results as executive chairman, said the prices
of most metals appeared to have stopped falling. 'However, they are likely
to be volatile for some time because of a combination of renewed investor
interest, possibly erratic supplies, and high inventories.'
RTZ is relying on continuing volume growth and low costs to increase its
profits. In copper it expects benefits this year from a rise in production
at Escondida in Chile, the second biggest copper mine in the world in which
it has a 30 per cent stake, and at Bingham Canyon in the US where a new
smelter will cut costs next year. The mine at Marandoo in Australia should
start producing this autumn increasing RTZ's annual iron ore output from 50m
to 60m tonnes. Total capital expenditure is expected to double from 1993's
Pounds 265m.
Philip Crowson, RTZ's chief economist, underlined the company's caution with
an analysis suggesting that average base metals prices are unlikely to
differ much this year from 1993. In spite of some signs of economic recovery
around the world, there would certainly not be enough of a rise in demand to
reverse the flood of metal into stocks, he said.
The extent of world oversupply of copper and aluminium, the two base metals
that most affect RTZ's performance, is illustrated by yesterday's London
Metal Exchange warehouse stock figures. Aluminium stands at a record
2,589,575 tonnes, and copper at 537,475 tonnes, well off the January peak
but still high.
Most analysts who watch base metals prices agree with Crowson that 1994 is
unlikely to prove exciting. Lawrence Eagles, of futures brokers GNI, is
forecasting 'several lacklustre years' before stocks are drawn down.
Crowson's projection is that prices this year will be liable 'to fluctuate
over a fairly wide range before any clear tends become established'. But
they should not drop back to the lows reached last November.
Since then, prices have risen about 20 per cent. The rise 'was triggered,
and even sustained by investors acting largely on technical analysis of
chart patterns', Crowson said.
Nick Moore, of Ord Minnett, an affiliate of the Jardine Fleming group, says
this is consistent with speculators moving in ahead of evidence of recovery.
He also points out that in the past three peak periods for base metals - in
1974, 1980, and 1988 - prices rose 150 per cent ahead of the low. But the
next peak could be three years away.
Kleinwort Benson last week said that for the first time all 15 prices in its
commodity index were rising at the same time. Leo Doyle, of Kleinwort, says
the index was not designed to say anything about the future direction of
commodity prices. It was an indicator of world economic activity. However,
if the underlying strength of the world economy is improving faster than
other estimates indicate, then base metal stocks could be drawn down faster
than many believe.
Whatever happens in the markets, says Moore, 'RTZ is in a terrific position
if it can make this sort of money in a recession.'

FT  12 MAR 94 / Markets: Investors who live on borrowed time - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investing with borrowed money is the kind of activity you associate with
hedge funds run by professional traders such as George Soros. No prudent
private investor would do it - would he?
Individual investors, however, are soon to be actively encouraged to trade
on borrowed money. And the people doing the encouraging are the governor of
the Bank of England and the chairman of the London Stock Exchange. Not, of
course, that these guardians of financial rectitude are setting out
deliberately to turn Britain into a nation of speculators. It is just a
by-product of their plans for a re-vamped stock market settlement system.
The Bank's proposals for an electronic system, known as Crest, have the
needs of large institutional investors in mind. Private investors are an
afterthought, at best. And the new system - whatever its overall merits -
will be generally bad for individuals. Their biggest gripe has been that
Crest virtually forces them to put their shares into 'nominee accounts'
which deprive them of some of their traditional shareholders' rights - such
as getting company documents and going to meetings.
Far less attention has been paid to the imminent introduction of margin
trading - investing in the stock market using borrowed money. This has long
been common practice in the US and in futures markets worldwide but, until
now, the UK stock market has worked on a peculiar system. All deals done by
an individual investor within a certain account period, usually a fortnight,
are netted out and settled six working days after the end of that period.
In July, the account system will be replaced by something called rolling
settlement under which each deal will be settled a certain number of days
after the actual bargain is struck - initially 10 but, eventually, five or
even three. There will not be time for investors to settle up within the
deadline. They will have two choices: either they keep substantial funds
with their broker or they open a margin account.
This means either that you put up a certain proportion of the cash you will
need for a share purchase and borrow the rest from your broker, or that you
pledge some of your existing shares to your broker as security against new
purchases - and borrow the rest of the purchase costs.
If, for example, you had a portfolio worth Pounds 50,000, you might be able
to borrow Pounds 25,000 for new purchases. But if the price of your shares
fell, your margin could fall below the agreed level and you would find your
broker making a margin call - in other words, asking you to top up your
deposit.
Here is a lucid exposition of how margin trading can oil the wheels of the
stock market mechanism. 'In the stock market, the buyer of securities on
margin gets full title to his property in an unconditional sale. But he rids
himself of the most grievous burden of ownership - that of putting up the
purchase price - by leaving his securities with his broker as collateral for
the loan that paid for them. The buyer . . . gets the full benefit of any
increase in value - the price of the securities goes up, but the loan that
bought them does not . . .
'The machinery by which Wall Street separates the opportunity to speculate
from the unwanted returns and burdens of ownership is ingenious, precise and
almost beautiful. Banks supply funds to brokers, brokers to customers, and
the collateral goes back to banks in a smooth and all but automatic flow . .
. Margins are effortlessly calculated and watched.'
It all sounds very efficient. But what is a touch worrying is that the
quotation comes from Professor JK Galbraith's classic book, The Great Crash
1929*. It describes in pitiless detail how margin trading eased the wheels
of the Wall Street boom and prepared the way for the bust.
When share prices started to fall, margin calls volleyed forth but, all too
often, went unanswered - because the investors, quite rapidly, ran out of
real money. Wall Street encountered the problem of 'negative equity' long
before British home-owners.
Of course, margin trading does not always have such tragic consequences. The
system flourishes in New York today without spreading routine financial
devastation. But, in the United States, margin requirements are controlled
tightly by the central bank. As yet, both the Bank of England and the London
Stock Exchange seem to be shrugging off all responsibility for margins.
Let us not exaggerate. Reckless trading on margins is likely to be a
minority problem. But it is ironic that the Bank is partly responsible for
introducing a potentially explosive system into this country.
Tax collectors have long ranked with pharisees and sinners as legitimate
popular hate objects. And avoiding paying unnecessary tax is almost a sport
among the investing classes. Early spring is the peak season for this.
Taxation phobia can become dangerous, however, if investors start choosing
investments purely because they are tax-effective. For example, many people
who went into business expansion schemes to enjoy the 40 per cent tax relief
ended up with a worthless investment. Be warned.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Imagine a city on the margins of western Europe - Trieste, Helsinki or
Marseilles, perhaps - perpetually beseiged by hoardes of frantic people.
Victims of social and economic collapse in their own countries to the east
and south, they have little to lose. What stands between them and a better
life is that most tangible of imaginary lines, a border.
They cross the frontier and its defences by any means possible - by small
boat, over fences and roof-tops, through underground drains, in blind mass
charges over empty wasteground. They are so numerous - more than 10,000
every night - that the authorities are overwhelmed. Those who are caught jam
the jails and detention centres and clog the legal system. Those who are not
caught disappear inside illegal immigrant communities, flood job markets and
bring social services to a point of collapse. More and more, Trieste,
Helsinki or Marseilles resembles the desperate, lawless places these
immigrants have left.
Such an inundation might appear far-fetched in western Europe. Apocalyptic
visions of this kind are usually raised by extremist groups concerned with
tightening already-rigorous immigration laws. But in one western city, it is
a reality.
The city is El Paso, in west Texas, on the US-Mexico border, where US
authorities have instituted unprecedented measures to staunch a flow of
illegal immigration. Recently I went riding with the US Border Patrol to see
what Operation Hold-the-Line, and opposition to it, is all about.
I drove into El Paso from the east along the Rio Grande River. As a natural
feature separating two countries the Rio Grande is unimpressive. It is so
narrow and shallow in parts that the name 'wetback', traditionally applied
to illegal Mexican immigrants who swam the river, hardly seemed to apply. On
several isolated stretches near the Santa Elena canyon I was able to wade
back and forth to Mexico without even getting my knees wet.
But the river has an ally in the land that surrounds it: the Chihuahua
Desert forms some of the most inhospitable country on the continent. Only
the most determined and well-organised 'illegals' try to make their way to
American cities on the northern side of this vast, empty tract of scrub and
cactus.
None the less, even here there are foreign nationals - Mexicans for the most
part, but also other Latin Americans and immigrants from as ar away as east
Asia - who make their way across the border with the hired help of Mexican
'coyotes', skilled guides with local knowledge.
Their ruses are many. Illegals have been known to walk backwards for miles
across the desert to confuse their trackers, or even to attach horseshoes to
wooden blocks on their feet. And the stakes can be high. Not long ago a
group of Chinese illegals paid Dollars 30,000 apiece for the privilege of
being smuggled across the Chihuahua desert into the US. They did not make
it.
From time to time as I drove through the desert I came across the highway
check-points and the green and white off-road vehicles of the US Border
Patrol. With slightly more than 4,000 men, the patrol is the first line of
defence against illegal immigration into the US.
El Paso, the patrol headquarters for this section of the frontier, took me
by surprise. It has long ceased to be the romantic cowboy town of western
legend. Today it is a busy military, commercial and industrial centre, the
largest on the frontier between Houston and San Diego. In El Paso I watched
spooky-looking Stealth bombers fly over the city from the runways of Fort
Bliss; got caught in horrific freeway traffic jams on Interstate 10; and
breathed desert air perfumed by a thick brown layer of factory smog. A
graceless, booming, nose-to-the-grindstone sort of place, El Paso was not a
city I found attractive.
But attraction is a relative matter. Directly opposite El Paso, a mere
three-minute walk over the Santa Fe International Bridge, lies the city of
Juarez, the fourth largest in Mexico. Separated by nothing more than a few
feet of shallow and muddy Rio Grande water, two worlds meet head on. One is
wealthy, productive and full of opportunity; the other is poor, corrupt,
underdeveloped and overcrowded. Seen from the other side of the river, El
Paso is a land of plenty.
'Hey, you wanna wake up in time for work?'
I was standing on a broken sidewalk at the bottom of Benito Juarez Avenue in
downtown Juarez, and talking to Frank, who was trying to sell me an alarm
clock. Juarez Avenue runs south from the international bridge. Catering to
the needs and weaknesses of day-tripping American tourists, it is a seedy,
garish street of ill-lit drinking places and souvenir shops, off-track
betting offices and strip joints, taco bars and dance halls. On the sidewalk
you can buy anything from stolen windscreen wipers to young girls. Frank was
hawking cheap watches and alarm clocks from a cardboard tray.
Frank had returned to Juarez after years as an illegal farm worker in
Fresno, California. Life was bad there for illegals, he told me, but the
money was good. He came back because he was falling apart. He was drinking
and smoking too much marijuana, and had become mixed up in hard drugs and
gang life. 'I almost died. Now I live clean, go to church every day, and
sell clocks for people to wake up.'
Frank is an exception. No matter how difficult life may be for Mexican
illegals - they are thought to number millions - few voluntarily return to
the grinding poverty of home. Nor has their presence, in the past at least,
been entirely unwelcome in the US. For decades, American business and
agricultural interests, especially in southern California, encouraged
illegal immigration because cheap Mexican labour meant bigger profits. From
time to time the US government cracked down on illegal immigration, but
there was a tacit acceptance that what was good for business was good for
America, and a blind eye was turned.
Order a meal in a Los Angeles restaurant today and the chances still are
that the salad you eat was grown, transported, prepared and served by
illegal labour. But it is no longer easy to enter the US. American
recession, unemployment, rocketing health and education costs, growing crime
and social problems and sheer weight of numbers has brought a dramatic
hardening of attitude. One of the toughest reactions is Operation
Hold-the-Line.
'We used to cross the river to work in El Paso and come back to Juarez to
sleep,' Frank told me. 'Hell, I knew guys who used to come home for lunch.
Now we have people here from central Mexico, with nothing to eat and nowhere
to stay, sleeping on cardboard and waiting days or weeks for a chance to
sneak over. Most often they don't get it.'
Operation Hold-the-Line, begun last September, was a radical change of
strategy for the El Paso Border Patrol. In the past, the 650 patrol agents
in the sector ran mobile patrols throughout their territory - 160 miles of
border and 125,000 square miles of rough, uninhabited desert frontierland
adjacent to it.
Although the patrol was arresting between 800 and 1,300 Mexicans a day, it
estimated 10 times that number, about 10,000 people a day, were regularly
getting through. The vast majority were crossing through the city itself.
Today El Paso is no longer an open corridor. Hold-the-Line adopts tactics of
permanent concentration where crossings are greatest: there is now one
patrol agent stationed every 400 yards from the Ysleta Spanish Mission on
the border in east El Paso to Sunland Park in the west, a distance of 20
miles. With such a blockade in force 24 hours a day, seven days a week,
illegal crossings are down by 90 per cent.
Originally called Operation Blockade and accompanied by a proposal to build
an impenetrable steel fence between El Paso and Juarez, the strategy
initially brought vigorous protest from the Mexican government, US civil
rights groups and the locally-powerful Catholic church. To some it was a
Berlin Wall. I got in touch with Monsignor Remundo Pena, the Bishop of El
Paso, to find out why Hold-the-Line had caused such a stir.
What, I asked the bishop, who began his career working with illegal Mexican
farm labourers in the lower Rio Grande Valley, was wrong with the border
patrol enforcing the law? Nothing, he replied. What needed looking into was
the law itself.
For the bishop, Hold-the-Line is an historical, economic and political
contradiction. Until last century, El Paso, and much of the south-western
US, was Mexican territory. Today, 70 per cent of the city's US population is
Hispanic. For many in the region, the border is an illogical inconvenience.
Work, too, unites rather than separates El Paso and Juarez. For decades, the
maquiladora, or twin plant system, has linked the cities. More than 70
corporations, including Honeywell, General Motors, Siemens, Toshiba and
Sony, manufacture goods in El Paso but have them cheaply assembled in
Juarez.
Above all, though, it is the alliances of the future that make Hold-the-Line
a non sequitur. With the signing last year of Nafta, the North American Free
Trade Agreement, the two cities on the border have become, in theory at
least, a symbol of a strong new partnership. How, asked the bishop, can you
promote Juarez-El Paso as a single international city of free trade, welcome
your new business partner, but then slam the door on his family? I went out
that evening to see how that exclusion process worked.
In the border patrol processing centre at the foot of the Santa Fe bridge I
watched patrolmen working under bright fluorescent lights. They were
searching newly apprehended illegals, questioning and registering them, and
placing them in holding cells prior to their return to Mexico.
Business was slow. A few teenagers came through, a prostitute, a couple of
children caught shoplifting. But bright light is not the patrolman's natural
element. His real work takes place in the dark of the night, when the vast
majority of illegals take their chances in an obscure, smog-ridden gloom.
'It's not just the Mexican factories that make the smoke,' said patrolman
Mike Moon as we bounced through the dark in a border patrol 4x4. 'People
sleeping rough along the river on the Juarez side get cold  - they burn old
tyres, cardboard, polystyrene boxes, anything they can get hold of. Some
nights it's hard to breathe down here.'
If breathing was difficult down beside the Rio Grande, seeing anything was
more difficult still. Here in the city the river is little more than a
shallow channel of water contained between concrete walls and the border
zone is a dim, half-lit world, an urban no-man's-land of abandoned waste
ground, barricaded no-go streets, empty railway yards, fenced-off
warehouses, chained gates, prohibited access zones and long stretches of
chain-link fences riddled with holes.
It is eerie, and slightly ominous. As we drove along the concrete banks of
the river, at regular intervals we passed parked vehicles in which uniformed
men sat hour after hour, eyes glued to binoculars and infra-red
night-sights, the only sound being the buzz and crackle of two-way radios.
Men sitting by roadside fires, women walking along the highway, boys
loitering in the shadows - nothing on the other side of the river went
unnoticed. After years on the job, Moon told me, patrolmen develop a sixth
sense for who, and who is not, waiting to make a dash over the border.
We drove further. Moon showed me marshalling yards where, prior to
Hold-the-Line, up to 80 Mexicans at a time would rush the border and freight
trains pulling out of El Paso. I saw school grounds where young illegals can
blend into a student population in seconds. Along the river I was shown
places where, during high summer water, boatmen landed their passengers in
the full view of Mexican authorities paid to look the other way. In the Sand
Hills area, where miles of Juarez slums back right on to the border, we
watched trackers set out after a group of illegals who had split up and gone
separate ways.
'Mike, we got a hit,' the radio buzzed a few minutes later. In patrol
parlance, a 'hit' is a signal from one of the thousands of magnetic sensors
concealed along the border. In this case it had come from a railway trestle
bridge spanning the Rio Grande. Already Ferny Melendez, a colleague of
Moon's, was tracking the intruders' passage along the bottom of a narrow
gully on the US side.
Fifteen minutes later Moon and I were waiting in a parking lot where the
gully rose steeply. Melendez had trailed his prey a mile and a half from the
bridge. For these unlucky immigrants, there was no way out except forward.
Our quarry was trapped.
I was expecting some tough hombres - drug runners maybe, or one of the gangs
of men who sometimes turn nasty. In the event, Mike Moon had to help his
catch out of the gully: two mothers, two children, two babies and two young
men in jeans and T-shirts. They did not seem angry or resentful as we
bundled them into the 4x4 for processing and deportation back to Mexico -
just hopeless and bone-weary. They were just six of 157 illegal immigrants
arrested that night.
Could the same situation, the same solution, develop in post-communist
Europe? I hope not. I found the whole process a miserable and depressing
one. But like North America, Europe also has its great contradiction: a
strategic need for economic unity on a continent of vast economic disparity.
Contrasts between east and western Europe are not diminishing, but growing
more acute. El Paso may seem far away, but the immigration dilemmas facing
the city in the desert may not be so far-fetched and remote after all.

FT  12 MAR 94 / The Long View: Taxing the Titanic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like other British financial columnists this spring I am suffering from what
might be called Budget deprivation - the absence of the mad March annual
publicity-grabbing exercise by the chancellor which has been transferred to
November. We are left glumly to ponder how badly demand in the economy will
be affected when the impact of the pre-programmed tax rises begins to be
felt next month.
A talk to the Confedration of British Industry this week by Stephen Dorrell,
one of the junior Treasury ministers, on his review of savings and the flow
of funds through the economy, was not exactly a substitute for a meaty red
dispatch box exercise. Nevertheless there were some fascinating pointers to
the way the Treasury views its functions and how politics and economics
become tangled.
In a thoughtful talk, Dorrell could not resist remarks such as 'savings are
the life blood of the economy'. Well, the political spin is nearly always
that savings are virtuous but consumption is self-indulgent and
shortsighted. The irony is that the Treasury, in its macroeconomic rather
than microeconomic mode, is gambling that a drop in savings next year will
offset the extra taxes it is loading on the economy.
If consumers insist on tightening their belts, rather than raiding their
piggy banks, the growth rate of the economy will falter, the higher tax
revenues forecast for 1994-95 will fail to materialise, and interest rates
may have to go up to maintain confidence in sterling and in the government's
ability to finance its deficit smoothly.
The idea that savings might be not so much the life blood as the cholesterol
of the economy was a foundation of Keynesian theories in the 1920s and
1930s. The private sector might decide to save too much to maintain full
employment. If there were too many misers their depressing influence might
need to be offset by some public sector spendthrifts. Spend now, tax later.
Trouble was, politicians tended to forget the second part of the formula, or
at any rate they replaced it with the modified version 'inflate later'.
The private sector of the economy has been saving on a massive scale
recently, in an attempt to reduce the debt burden it acquired in the late
1980s. The personal sector has been in massive financial surplus for a
couple of years now, and the company sector turned itself around during
1993, so that in the third quarter of last year the combined private sector
surplus was running at about 6 per cent of gdp. The public sector was forced
to dissave in order to prevent an economic collapse; hence the nervousness
about its efforts to pass part of the parcel back again by reducing the
deficit.
The personal savings ratio jumped from 7.2 per cent in 1989 to 12.6 per cent
in 1992, and it is generally forecast to fall back below 10 per cent by next
year. At this level it would be slightly below the international norm, but
well above the notoriously low US figure of about 4 per cent (although the
definitions vary).
Of course, politicians do not say that people should save less. They do not
eliminate tax shelters such as Peps, and indeed there is some logic in that
because these are long-term incentives and should not be imperilled by
temporary problems. Cutting short-term interest rates is the most common and
effective means of hitting savings. Again, this is not expressed directly,
and other reasons for changes tend to be given. Relative to the inflation
rate, however, short-term interest rates are not particularly low and,
ironically, the cut in mortgage interest relief coming next month will have
the opposite effect of discouraging borrowing and thus of boosting the
saving ratio.
But, although saving remains comparatively high, the really odd thing about
the British economy is that consumption is high too. We are living beyond
our means as a nation, with an external current account deficit of Pounds
10bn or more. Government consumption is offsetting private sector frugality.
The way back to external balance is through more saving and investment. But
that would cause a collapse in government revenues. Stand by for a tricky
balancing act.
The Dorrell review, however, appears to be mainly about the microeconomic
aspects of savings and investment flows: whether pension funds are too
greedy for dividends, for instance, or whether clearing banks are too
obsessed by the availability of collateral when financing small companies.
Perhaps the government is struggling to develop some kind of philosophy,
after Norman Lamont suddenly imposed what amounted to an extra tax on
company dividends in the final spring Budget 12 months ago. The reasoning
behind that has never been explained, except to the extent that the move
raised a significant amount of new tax revenue.
There may be an attempt to dump some Thatcherite baggage. The Thatcher
government originally had some clear dogmatic objectives, such as levelling
various playing-fields including those relating to the taxes on dividends
and debt and the taxes on personal income and capital gains. Market forces
were to be supreme. But eventually the clarity became buried beneath an
accretion of Peps, Tessas and Business Expansion Schemes.
Stephen Dorrell appeared to offer little in the way of principles, just a
series of questions about whether maybe the UK should seek to channel
resources to a British recreation of the German Mittelstand, or medium-sized
manufacturers, and whether British companies pay out too much in dividends.
Was that the reason, perhaps, for the dividend tax changes a year ago?
But we are going over some very old ground, albeit beloved by meddlesome
politicians. Changing the tax allowances on the Titanic will not provide
much protection against icebergs, or even medium-sized U-boats. Enough of
reviews, roll on the next Budget.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Testing time for wind farms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The wind energy industry has been warned it must overcome objections that
wind farms are noisy and spoil the landscape if it wants government
subsidies.
Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, said yesterday that if the industry was
to develop 'it must find sites which are acceptable to the planning
process'.
In the past, the government has stressed the environmental benefits of wind
power while playing down criticisms of their noise and visual impact.
Mr Eggar also said wind farms would only get financial support if there was
a prospect that they would produce electricity at market prices. Like most
renewable forms of energy, wind power is several times more expensive than
conventional sources.
Mr Eggar's comments came as the Department of Trade and Industry released
details of applications for the latest round of the non-fossil fuel
obligation, the scheme to subsidise renewable energy projects. Of the 650
applications for financial help - including small-scale hydroelectric
schemes, and heat from waste and tidal power projects - some 230 were wind
farms. However Mr Eggar doubted that more than 20 wind farms would be
approved for subsidy.
'This will depend on developers' abilities to find sufficient windy sites
which are acceptable in planning terms,' he said. Successful bidders will be
announced at the end of this year.
Mr Joseph Lythgoe, a leading anti-wind farm campaigner, said Mr Eggar
appeared to be 'trimming his sails', although 20 new wind farms would treble
the number already in operation.
Friends of the Earth, the environmental group, accused Mr Eggar of imposing
'an arbitrary limit' on wind farms before the local planning process had
assessed individual projects.
Dr Ian Mays, chairman of the British Wind Energy Association, said
competition would ensure that only the most cost effective and
environmentally acceptable projects went ahead.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Poland in deal with banks to cut debt
</HEADLINE>

Poland and its London Club commercial bank creditors yesterday signed an
agreement in principle for the reduction and rescheduling of Poland's
Dollars 13.2bn (Pounds 9bn) private sector debt, allowing the country to
return to the international capital markets.
Details of the agreement, reached after four years of negotiations, will
probably take until September to finalise. It was signed in Frankfurt
between Dresdner Bank, representing more than 300 foreign bank creditors,
and Mr Krzysztof Krowacki, Poland's foreign debt negotiator. The debt
reduction will cost the banks about 42.5 per cent of their outstanding loans
and unpaid interest, according to Dresdner Bank, which has led the London
Club talks. The exact figure will depend on the mix of repayment methods
chosen by creditors from options established by the agreement.
The reduction is well below the 50 per cent write-off sought by Poland as
required by the terms of its April 1991 Paris Club agreement with government
creditors.
The Paris Club agreed a two-stage, 50 per cent reduction in Poland's Dollars
33bn official debt, contingent on Poland's compliance with strict
International Monetary Fund budgetary targets. It obliged Poland to seek
similar terms from its bank creditors. Poland faces annual debt servicing
charges of about Dollars 4.5bn by 2005 under the Paris Club deal.
The commercial banks refused to consider themselves bound by the Paris Club
terms and insisted that Poland could pay more.
In recognition of Poland's short-term budgetary restraints, however, the
London Club agreement is graduated with higher repayments in later years.
The deal will cost Warsaw Dollars 400m a year on average over the first five
years of a 30-year repayment period, Dollars 520m a year over the first 10
years and Dollars 600m a year over the first 15 years. Poland will offer to
repurchase part of its Dollars 9.3bn principal debt and Dollars 3.8bn
overdue interest at a price to be announced by Warsaw.
Mr Krowacki said the agreement, which will cost Poland an estimated Dollars
1.3bn in 1994, signifies the normalisation of the country's financial
relations. 'Without such an agreement, Poland would have had to renegotiate
its Paris Club agreement and that would have been suicidal,' he said.
The World Bank has set aside Dollars 500m to help Poland finance the deal.
The IMF has agreed to provide Dollars 300m. This leaves Dollars 500m to be
financed this year from Poland's official and banking system reserves, which
currently stand at about Dollars 7.6bn.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Army joins 'homeland' battle: S Africa troops act to restore
order in Bophuthatswana
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR

<DATELINE>
   MMABATHO, BOPHUTHATSWANA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The South African army last night moved in to the black 'homeland' of
Bophuthatswana, chasing out rightwing whites who had taken control of the
capital Mmabatho, in a drive to restore order after looting and fierce
fighting left at least 60 dead.
Power changed hands several times between the Bophuthatswana Defence Force,
the South African Defence Force and thousands of paramilitary rightwing
whites who had taken control of the capital Mmabatho and its twin town,
Mafikeng. But by early this morning the South African Defence Force appeared
to have the homeland largely under control.
Among those killed in yesterday's fighting were two rightwing whites
executed by a Bophuthatswana soldier as they begged for mercy.
South African government officials said the defence force had been deployed
in strength to take control after local police and soldiers joined a popular
revolt against President Lucas Mangope who said he wanted Bophuthatswana to
remain as a separate state and refused to participate in South Africa's
first all race election in April.
Last night South African officials said Mr Mangope might be allowed to
remain titular head of state, but the homeland would in effect come under
martial rule from Pretoria.
At first only 150 troops were deployed but government officials said later
1,500 troops were being sent in with a large back-up force to remain nearby.
A foreign ministry official said 57 bodies were reported at Victoria
Hospital in Mmabatho and 10 bodies elsewhere after two days of looting and
bitter fighting.
Yesterday's events represented a humiliating defeat for the right wing,
which had sent thousands of supporters to shore up Mr Mangope's failing
regime, and a victory for the ANC, which has achieved its goal of ensuring
Bophuthatswana will be reincorporated into South Africa and that its 2m
citizens can participate in next month's elections.
Mr Mangope's status remained unresolved last night, with the chairman of the
Independent Electoral Commission, which is supervising the conduct of the
poll, flying to Mmabatho to insist on guarantees from him that
Bophuthatswana will participate in the poll.
Earlier, Mr Mangope issued a statement saying he had registered a political
party, the Northwest Christian Democrat party, to contest the elections but
government officials said this statement did not go far enough to satisfy
Pretoria and the ANC on election participation.
Late yesterday afternoon, South African President FW de Klerk met Mr Nelson
Mandela, leader of the ANC, to decide the fate of President Mangope after
the police and army revolted against his rule. Mr Mandela has urged joint
administration of the homeland, through the Transitional Executive Council,
the body which oversees government in the run up to elections.
As dusk fell three black bodies lay in the main street of Mafikeng,
apparently shot by whites, while South African armoured personnel carriers
escorted whites beyond the border into South Africa. Villagers cheered as
the South Africa troops chased the rightwing whites out.
Earlier, outside the headquarters of the Bophuthatswana police, three whites
were killed after a group in trucks being chased by Bophuthatswana Defence
Force soldiers opened fire on black bystanders, provoking a gun battle.
Three men were wounded. As they fell from their vehicle, one was shot
immediately, and two others lay on the ground, begging for mercy before a
Bophuthatswana soldier shot them dead.

FT  12 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Eurotunnel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market is growing jittery about Eurotunnel. The units fell 5 per cent
yesterday on a French media report suggesting the Channel tunnel would not
be open for the critical summer season. Eurotunnel was unable to issue a
convincing denial. That is probably because it has no firm idea when it will
open. Delays in delivering rolling stock and commissioning operating systems
are proving troublesome.
Eurotunnel is surely right to postpone the phased openings until its train
sets are working smoothly. It would do immense damage to its reputation to
open prematurely and offer a poor service. That, though, will only intensify
the headaches in its finance department. Eurotunnel has said it will run out
of cash in May which is why it needs to raise Pounds 1bn in fresh debt and
equity. But no merchant banker will sign off a rights issue prospectus
before the opening dates are fixed and revenue projections can be made with
the minimum uncertainty.
Eurotunnel says the prospectus will be published before June but not
necessarily before the official state opening on May 6. That raises the
possibility of a further slippage in the fund raising's timing. Eurotunnel
should have little difficulty arranging stand-by facilities with its bankers
should the cash run out in the meantime. There is little alternative use for
such a big hole in the ground. But the delay can only worsen the terms under
which the rights issue is staged.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At first glance, this week's decision by Whitbread to sell its regional
brewing stakes suggests an inclination to expand more in leisure than
brewing. In fact its strategic options are about as open as before. All that
can be said for certain is that Whitbread will not use the stakes acquired
from Whitbread Investment Co last year to make full bids for the regional
brewers. The most obvious explanation is that Whitbread does not want to
acquire new estates of varying quality when that would require offsetting
sales of pubs under the government's competition rules.
Indeed the rules make it so complicated for big brewers to buy small ones
that the strategic imperative must be considerable to make it worthwhile.
Consolidation may yet come, though, as a result of regional brewers buying
each other. Once the Whitbread sale has been absorbed, selective bid
premiums could appear in their shares. Unlike the big brewers, the regionals
have scope to expand their pub estates. That would lessen their dependence
on a particular regional economy, add efficiency to food operations and give
them the clout to negotiate larger discounts from outside beer suppliers.
There may be less room for brewing. Even large regionals lack the scale to
develop their brands nationally - which is why opportunities may yet arise
for Whitbread in brewing. It has shown with Boddington what it can do with a
regional beer brand while its original owner concentrated on retailing. All
it needed to begin with was the brewery and the brand, not the pubs.

FT  12 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Grumman
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The sharks are circling closer in the US defence business. Despite a 40 per
cent fall in military hardware spending from the peak six years ago, most
consolidation deals in the US industry have been reasonably friendly asset
swaps. Now the possibilities for partnerships are narrowing, and the
potential losers are threatening to turn nasty - hence the struggle for
control of Grumman between Martin Marietta and Northrop.
In aircraft, Grumman has seen production of its A-6 and F-14 carrier-based
bombers and interceptors ended. Northrop is also suffering from cuts in the
B-2 stealth bomber programme. Yet both companies have continuing
aero-structures work, Grumman with the E2-C early-warning aircraft and F-14
refurbishment, Northrop with the F-18 fighter and the Boeing 747. There is
thus logic in consolidating the businesses. Martin Marietta also has a
claim, however. Its strong connections to the US army and its electronics
and space surveillance expertise would complement Grumman's electronics
manufacturing, spy-plane technology and naval links.
The risk is that in an effort to retain position, both Martin and Northrop
may overpay for Grumman. With manufacturing sites spread widely around the
US, rationalisation costs will be heavy for either bidder. There is also the
outside chance of competition difficulties with the Federal Trade
Commission. President Clinton has said there will be no further cuts in
military budgets, but there is no guarantee a leaner industry will leave
shareholders with much to cheer about.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's trade figures provided a wonderful excuse for more outpourings
of gloom on the UK economy. The markets' predictable conclusion was that
even this modest recovery is exacting a terrible price on the trade account.
As the deficit is deteriorating more quickly than many expected, the
authorities may be forced sooner into corrective action. At the very least,
the weaker tone of sterling may make them more reluctant to cut interest
rates. That has nasty implications for gilts which promptly fell 1.5 points
with equities following down behind.
There is a danger, though, that the markets will become too fixated on the
bad news. True, the trade deficit remained disturbingly high throughout the
recession. True, also, the 11 per cent increase in export unit prices over
the past year suggests UK industry is still prepared to sacrifice long-term
market share for short-term margins. But the worst part of the deterioration
was in exports to continental Europe in the closing couple of months of last
year when sterling was rising towards DM2.60.
The currency has now fallen back closer to DM2.50, while at some stage
European interest rates must fall to the point where recovery sets in,
allowing the UK scope to continue growing. By then, yesterday's market
reaction may be seen as a buying opportunity, especially in gilts which now
offer a full percentage point yield premium to German bunds. A couple of
months of good inflation figures would make present yields look attractive,
which might permit the government to fund aggressively again.

FT  12 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow gains from late bond
price rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
After a mixed morning, the US stock market ended a fractious week firmly
higher, thanks primarily to a late rally in bond prices, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 32.08 at 3,862.70, its
high for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended up 2.54
at 466.44, while the American Stock Exchange finished up 1.20 at 465.98.
The Nasdaq composite fared less well, and closed only 0.11 higher at 789.20.
Trading volume was 303m shares.
After Thursday's frenetic trading in bonds and stocks, much of it prompted
by unsubstantiated rumours concerning the White House and the Whitewater
affair, some semblance of calm returned to financial markets yesterday.
Share prices, however, opened lower after an early rally in the bond market
had fizzled out. That rally in bonds had been inspired by a February retail
sales report. Although the figures showed a bigger than expected increase of
1.5 per cent in February sales, bond market investors and traders chose to
concentrate instead on a surprise, and sharp, downward revision in the
January data. If the two months were taken together, analysts said, sales
were essentially flat in early 1994, which was good news for
inflation-sensitive bonds.
Yet the bond market could not hold on to its early gains, which disturbed
equity investors. Consequently, stocks fell across the board in the first
hour of trading.
However, the market later rallied convincingly off its lows, and again it
was bond prices which provided the lead. Bonds, having fallen to opening
values mid-morning, revived later, and by late afternoon the benchmark
30-year government bond was up three quarters of a point, and the yield was
down to 6.909 per cent.
The rally inspired the stock market, and aided by short-covering, blue-chip
stocks steadily recovered during a busy afternoon of buying.
Among individual issues, Grumman jumped Dollars 9 7/8 to Dollars 64 3/4 in
volume of 2m shares after a second rival defence group, Northrop, offered to
buy the company. Northrop's offer of Dollars 60 a share tops an earlier,
agreed, bid from Martin Marrietta worth Dollars 55 a share.
The rise in Grumman's stock yesterday implies that the market expects the
bidding war to escalate well beyond Dollars 60 a share. The news left
Northrop up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 41 3/8 and Martin Marrietta off Dollars
2 at Dollars 44 1/2 .
Unisys climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 15 3/4 , lifted by news of a Dollars
127m banking automation contract awarded to the company and a ratings
upgrade from brokerage house Lehman Brothers.
International Paper, hit earlier in the week by a profits warning, rebounded
Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 69 7/8 after Paine Webber upgraded its rating on the
stock from 'neutral' to 'buy'.
Canada
Toronto shares ended little changed in active trading.
The composite index was up 3.68 points, or 0.08 per cent, to 4446.86, for a
gain on the week of about 48 points.
In Friday's trading, declines led advances by 376 to 371, volume of 94.959
shares was below Thursday's 100.444 shares, and trading value fell to
CDollars 823m from CDollars 917.5m.
Most gains were limited. Industrial products gained 0.61 per cent, consumer
products and energy were flat, and mining, financial services, and golds
were down slightly.

FT  12 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Germany offers detachment from
US woes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses suffered again from nervousness over falling US stock and bond
prices, but there was belated evidence that Germany could offer a degree of
detachment, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT extended Thursday's post bourse losses, ending with the Dax index
37.61 down on the session and 21.02 lower than its overnight close at
2,103.49. Turnover fell from DM9bn to DM8.2bn.
However, there were two points of encouragement. The offical close was 2.1
per cent higher on the week; and the Ibis indicated Dax held up well in the
afternoon, closing at 2,101.89 although Wall Street had another weak
morning.
Mr Eckhard Frahm, of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, said that as the IG Metall
wage settlement boosted German equities on Monday, yesterday's agreement
with the public workers' union, OeTV, gave equities some support after
hours.
Viag, as expected, was not popular. The terms of Thursday's deal to buy
Bayernwerk from the Bavarian government left the shares DM31.50, or 6.4 per
cent lower at DM458.50.
MILAN was led higher by telecoms as the Comit index added 1.52 to 665.26 for
a 1.9 per cent rise over the week. The mood, however, remained restrained
ahead of elections at the end of the month and the end of the account next
week.
Sip added L171 or 2.9 per cent to L4,534, for a two-day rise of 8.4 per
cent, after news that the government will reduce its license fee to
compensate for its loss of the mobile telephone monopoly. Stet added L89 to
L4,906 and Italcable L174 to L10,716, on news that the telecoms companies
are to meet next Saturday to decide on conversion rates for their shares
ahead of the privatisation of the sector.
Parmalat shed L96 or 3.9 per cent to L2,352 as plans to raise up to L500bn
in bonds over the next five years raised worries that the company might be
trying to grow too fast.
PARIS balanced rights and convertible issue news against a slight cut in
overnight rates and came out with the CAC-40 index down 9.67 at 2,174.91 for
a fractional decline on the week. Turnover was FFr4bn.
Dealers pounced on Paribas after its rights issue news, and the shares lost
FFr14.10 at FFr491.90. Eurotunnel fared even worse, down FFr3, or nearly 6
per cent at FFr48 on reports that its passenger service might not open until
after the summer holiday season.
Elsewhere, Michelin fell FFr8.40 to FFr251 on US selling and TF1, the TV
channel, by FFr16.50 to FFr498.50 after a big block trade.
ZURICH lost 1 per cent, the SMI index falling 29.6 to 2,831.6 for a 1.2 per
cent drop on the week.
Banks saw further foreign selling. SBC shed SFr11 to SFr424 and UBS bearers
were SFr14 down at SFr1,230.4.
Cyclicals, however, continued to find favour with Brown Boveri another SFr8
higher at SFr1,179, in further response to Thursday's results. Sulzer added
SFr19 to a year's high of SFr1,039.
Nestle shed SFr16 to SFr1,247: Lehman Brothers downgraded the stock, saying
that the discount of the shares to equivalent international issues had been
eliminated as the stock had significantly outperformed the S &amp; P food index.
AMSTERDAM combined the weakening dollar and falling bonds in a downbeat mood
that sent the AEX sliding 4.67 to 417.63, an improvement of 0.8 per cent
over the week.
But there was also a feeling that the market is poised for an upswing on
strong corporate results. Heineken, which pleased the market after the close
of trading on Thursday, bounced Fl 3.20 to Fl 232.50.
STOCKHOLM was knocked by higher debt market yields at home and lower
equities abroad. The Affarsvarlden General Index slid 22.7 to 1501.6, a fall
of 0.7 per cent on the week.
Ericsson B moved the index with a fall in of SKr16 to SKr343. The decline
continued in early Wall St trading.
Volvo B fell SKr14 to SKr669 over doubts on its cross ownership deal with
Renault.
OSLO fell 1.5 per cent as Norsk Hydro unexpectedly unveiled a rights issue
to raise up to NKr5bn. The all-share index fell 9.88 to 654.97 in active
turnover of NKr653m. Norsk Hydro shed NKr11 to NKr243 although the minority
Labour government said that it planned to maintain its 51 per cent stake and
participate in the issue.
ISTANBUL was boosted by a flurry of buying in a market that had fallen 12
per cent in the previous four days. The bargain hunting pushed up the
composite index up 779.92 to 14,511.25, a fall of 6.9 per cent on the week.
But bearish feeling remained with some dealers feeling that the surge was
premature. Most of the buying interest centred on sectors unlikely to be
affected by currency fluctuations.

FT  12 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Madrid to broaden its base with new
listings - Brokers see a profitable 1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You might excuse Spaniards for thinking that their stock markets were out of
touch with the real world.
The news has been of record unemployment, almost 24 per cent according to
the last quarterly survey and expected to rise; inflation edging up to 5 per
cent; a worrying growth in the public sector deficit; and a crisis in one of
the traditional pillars of the banking system. All this, apparently, has had
little impact on equity trends.
Last year, the Spanish economy shrank by 1 per cent, its worst performance
for 30 years, but stocks on the Madrid market increased in value by 50.7 per
cent, beating the main world markets including Frankfurt. In January, in the
aftermath of the Spanish authorities' dramatic intervention in Banco Espanol
de Credito (Banesto), the market rallied with an 11 per cent rise. The
December 1985-based general index scored an all-time high of 358.57.
Since then it has fallen back, but the level of about 335 around which it
has fluctuated in the past few days is still higher than the index attained
in 1993.
The market started last year, however, at a point analysts consider to have
been unrealistically low, with high interest rates detracting from the
relative attractiveness of equity investments. Recent increases in stock
prices have been closely linked to expectations of lower interest levels.
Bond rates, after an erratic period, have come down. And last week the Bank
of Spain unexpectedly cut its official benchmark interest rate by a full
half-point to 8 per cent.
Madrid's Bolsa is also strongly influenced by trends in other European
markets, especially Paris and Frankfurt. It is one of the few markets which
did not touch new highs in the preceding months. Until January, the record
for the general index had stood for over four years at 328.55.
In an atmosphere of cautious optimism about economic improvement, at least
in terms of a lower annual inflation rate later in the year and a
restoration of modest economic growth, some brokers forecast that the market
could brush the 400 level by the end of this year. Mr Paul Farrow of Ahorro
Corporacion predicts 380, although he believes that it could fall back in
the interim to about 320. He expects some Pta900bn (Dollars 6.6bn) of new
money to flow into the market through the growth of equity unit trusts.
Currently 2 per cent or less of Spanish mutual fund investments are in
equities, but Mr Farrow believes that this will expand to 8 per cent in 1994
because of the fall in interest rates.
Another leading broker, FG Inversiones Bursatiles, is more conservative,
forecasting about 365 for the year-end. But Mrs Monica Morales of Societe
Generale Valores says: 'The received wisdom is that it will go up by about
20 per cent.'
Subscriptions close today for the first big share offering of the year, in
which 15 per cent of the Continente supermarket group, controlled by
Promodes, is being brought to the market, where it will immediately join the
Ibex-35 group of blue-chip stocks. In the footsteps of the Carrefour
subsidiary, Pryca, it is the first significant entry by a private-sector
company for more than two years.
A series of other placings will follow. These include some Dollars 104m
worth of shares in the Aumar motorway company currently held by Banco
Central Hispano and around Dollars 300m worth in the privately-controlled
FCC construction concern - the latter the largest-ever operation of its kind
in the private sector.
A 10 per cent slice of Endesa, the state-controlled electricity generator,
is due to be placed by early June, worth some Dollars 1.4bn. Part of this
stake may, however, go to a European 'strategic partner'. A further 20 per
cent of Repsol, the partly-privatised oil group, is expected to be offered
for sale in the second half.
Cortefiel, a family-controlled retailer, is thought likely to come on to the
market in the coming months. The government is also expected to sell off its
24 per cent direct holding in Telefonica Internacional, the
foreign-operation subsidiary of Telefonica, the state-majority
telecommunications group.
The market remains a narrow one, however, with the vast bulk of trading
concentrated in 25 to 30 large companies, principally banks and utilities.
Banks have been particularly active in the wake of the crisis at Banesto,
for which a rescue package is being put together under the auspices of the
Bank of Spain. Another of Spain's leading institutions in the sector,
Central Hispano, has recently come under selling pressure after Moody's
announced that it was reviewing its ratings for the bank's certificates of
deposit.
However, Banesto, which faces a shareholders' meeting two weeks from today
to approve the rescue plan, is regarded as an isolated case. Its misfortunes
appear to have done little damage to market confidence.
The difficulties at the bank were widely known about by the time the crisis
came to a head in late December, and most foreign institutional investors
were already giving the stock a wide berth. 'If something similar were to
happen to another bank it would be very serious,' says one analyst. But as
long as it goes no further than Banesto, the market has shown itself able to
take the crisis in its stride.

FT  12 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei steady in
cautious region

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares recouped morning losses caused by technical selling linked to the
March futures and options settlements and the Nikkei average closed
marginally higher, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 index closed up 24.60 to 20,115.31, or 0.7 per cent higher on
the week, after fluctuating between 20,256.23 and a low of 20,017.10. The
index also met selling by investment trusts in response to the yen's rise
against the dollar, but gained ground in the afternoon thanks to foreigner
buying.
Volume swelled on transactions linked to the futures and options
settlements, totaling 750m shares against 426m. The Topix index of all first
section stocks rose 3.39 to 1,619.90, while the Nikkei 300 added 0.15 to
298.42. Gains outnumbered losses by 609 to 422, with 158 issues remaining
unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei index rose 24.60 to 20,115.31.
Foreign investors supported blue chip shares while some individuals dabbled
in speculative favourites. Hitachi rose Y3 to Y930, Toshiba gained Y10 to
Y780 while Sanyo Electric rose Y13 to Y497.
Aids related issues were higher on reports that Japan Energy, a mining
development and petroleum refining company, will launch clinical tests in
the US for an anti-Aids treatment it has developed. The issue jumped Y18 to
Y438 while investors sought other stocks linked to the 'Aids theme' such as
Sankyo, which rose Y50 to Y2,530 and Tsumura which advanced Y60 to Y1,760.
Mining stocks were bought as gold prices rose. Sumitomo Metal Mining added
Y29 to Y920.

Roundup
Regional markets remained cautious although some bargain hunting was seen.
HONG KONG was uneasy about the outlook for US interest rates and prospects
for the Chinese economy. The Hang Seng index, registered a 223.39 fall
taking it below 10,000 at 9,905.66, little changed on the week.
Attention was also focused on index futures which closed at a slight
discount to cash.
Cathay Pacific fell 40 cents to HKDollars 12.10 after announcing a fall in
its profits of 23.8 per cent. HSBC eased HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 102.
Jardine Matheson managed to swim agains the tide and added 50 cents to
HKDollars 63.
AUSTRALIA was weaker in line with the futures market. The All Ordinaries
index fell 2 to 2,153.1, for a weekly rise of 1.7 per cent, with a public
holiday on Monday limiting the potential for any advance.
SINGAPORE saw a lacklustre day, the Straits Times Industrial index losing 4
to 2,190.10, for a cumulative 2.6 per cent decline on the week. Against the
trend Genting rose 50 cents to SDollars 16.80 and Bukit Sem put on 30 cents
to Dollars S25.00.
MANILA saw some confidence returning as bargain hunters appeared on
expectations of further gains.
The composite index rose 0.94 to 2,553.78, but 2 per cent lower over the
week. The buying interest was boosted by a rally in mining issues after gold
rose sharply in New York.
BOMBAY fell further toward the close as speculators squared up forward
positions on the last day of trading before the March 12 deadline to wipe
out such positions, brokers said.
The Bombay Stock Exchange 30-share national index ended 60.50 points lower
at 3,747.22.
KUALA LUMPA rebounded on interest in secondline stocks and the composite
index edged up 0.48 to 1,046.48, but was 1.7 per cent lower on the week.
TAIWAN stocks reversed slight early gains to close lower on a late wave of
selling focused on the pulp and paper and textile sectors. The weighted
index ended 38.46 down at 5,327.57, this year's lowest finish, and a 6.1 per
cent decline on the week.

FT  12 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 3,200 lost as bond weakness
hits shares - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An unexpected setback in UK government bonds undermined the stock market
yesterday, driving the FT-SE Index down 42 points as it abandoned the 3,200
mark in equity trading described as brisk, but by no means heavy. London
suffered more seriously than other European markets from the backwash of
Thursday's setback in US bonds.
A weakening in sterling against the German mark, attributed both to
disappointment with the widening of the UK trade deficit in December, and
with the cross current from the dollar's fall, posed a threat to the stock
market's hopes for a base rate cut. Equity strategists read the trade
figures as indicating that export growth might be faltering, although some
perceived this as a buttress to interest rate optimism.
Equities opened lower and gave further ground as selling of stock index
futures developed ahead of the expiry next week of the March contract on the
FT-SE Index. The pace of the setback increased sharply in late afternoon,
when the equity trading account drew to its close. Although both Wall Street
and the New York bond market performed steadily following publication of the
US retail sales data for last month, UK gilts plunged through important
support levels.
The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 3,191.9, with virtually no sign
of recovery. The Index has fallen by 86.1 points this week for a total loss
of 2.7 per cent over the two week trading account.
Share prices had tried at the beginning of the week to disengage from the
slide in bonds but yesterday's performance indicates that bond markets
continue to rule equities. The big pension funds, and similar income seeking
institutional investors, are still restructuring portfolios in the light of
the rise in bond yields over the past three weeks.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index fell 51 points to 3,857.4, although traders said
that prices for these second line stocks had simply been marked down with
the blue chips, and had seen little selling.
Seaq trading volume of 776.3m shares was well short of the previous session.
Thursday's 901.9m shares returned a retail worth of Pounds 2.12bn, at the
top end of this year's daily averages.
The setback in share prices was evenly spread, with hardly any sectors
escaping the pressure. Some banking stocks were hit hard, in spite of the
market's favourable response to the sector's dividend prospects. But so also
were many of the leading industrial stocks.
However, analysts sounded relatively undismayed by the sudden downturn.
Longer term views remained faily sanguine with higher dividends and earnings
expected to continue helping a market where interest rate hopes have become
more subdued. This week has brought a number of good profits and dividend
statements, with BTR and Rolls-Royce standing out well.
But there was disappointment with the reaction by UK equities and bonds to a
fairly mild day for economic news. Next week brings more serious tests for
investor sentiment in the form of producer prices, retail sales and public
sector borrowing data on the UK economy.
With global markets still highly sensitive to the chances of a tightening in
credit policy by the US Federal Reserve, markets will also be challenged
next week by producer and consumer pricing statistics from Washington.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Footsie futures fell sharply and dragged the cash market down on the last
day of the equity trading account, writes Clare Gascoigne.
A sustained fall in UK government bonds saw the FT-SE 100 contract for March
expiry hit a low of 3,165 in the afternoon. Technical factors were blamed
for much of the weakness and a late rally saw the contract hit 3,171 by the
official close. Turnover was heavier than usual with just under 20,000
contracts dealt.
In traded options, volume rose to 56,834 contracts. Barclays was the most
active stock option, trading 4,257.

FT  12 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Thorn wanted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An upbeat note from Hoare Govett helped Thorn EMI stay in positive
territory, the shares edging forward 3 to 1118p. The broker said that the
potential recovery upside in the music industry, rising margins in the US
record market and Thorn's position as software supplier in the unfolding
multimedia revolution all warranted further investor exposure to the stock.
Leisure analyst Mr Hamish Dickson added: 'Thorn shares still trade at
substantial discounts to their peers in the media/entertainment sector. But
as this is increasingly viewed in global terms, we believe Thorn's rating
will rise to eliminate this anomaly.'
Fresh downward pressure on index-linked gilts triggered further selling of
the 'recs' which showed Eastern 11 1/2 off at 613 1/2 p and Southern 20
lower at 615p.
Severn Trent, given a midweek boost by Credit Lyonnais Laing, was the most
resilient of the water stocks, closing 2 firmer at 556p.
A general restructuring of gilt yields also increased the pressure on the
equity market's other high-yielding stocks, such as BT. The latter dropped
13 to 412 1/2 p on turnover of 8.1m. British Gas fell 5 to 301p.
Enterprise Oil fell 10 to 411p on further consideration of the preliminary
results, but BP held up well to close only a fraction easier at 351p on
turnover of 10m shares.
Lloyds Bank suffered from bouts of profit-taking, closing 14 off at 564p as
did Royal Bank of Scotland, 16 weaker at 428p while the hefty losses on the
Hong Kong market kept the pressure on Standard Chartered, 9 lower at 1113p
and HSBC, 26 off at 833p.
Willis Corroon's excellent figures continued to sustain the shares which ran
up 4 more to 227p. Disappointment over figures from advertising agency
Abbott Mead Vickers saw the shares fall 22 to 708p. The group announced a
1993 profit of Pounds 4.75m, up 0.6 per cent, and said it was confident
about future prospects.
Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel fell 29 to 561p in London and slumped 3.6
per cent in Paris after press reports raised concerns about the starting
date for the passenger service. Eurotunnel said a French newspaper report
that the service might not start before the autumn was 'pure speculation'
and no opening date had been fixed. After the market closed Eurotunnel said
the state opening of the tunnel would take place on May 6 but it declined to
elaborate on passenger traffic timing.
Textiles group Coats Viyella improved 4 to 266p ahead of results on
Wednesday. The market is expecting profits of between Pounds 143m and Pounds
150m, up from Pounds 109.1m in 1992.
Positive recommendations from two securities houses failed to prevent
engineering group TI from sliding with the market. Agency broker James Capel
upgraded its recommendation from hold to buy and BZW was also enthusiastic.
However, TI has a significant exposure to the US and the weakness in the Dow
saw the shares close 9 off at 400p.
Reed International which is also heavily exposed to the US fell 19 to 880p
ahead of full-year figures on Thursday.
Reuters Holdings slid 50p to 2048p after Merrill Lynch downgraded the stock
to neutral from buy in the intermediate term. Analyst Mr Neil Barton said he
still rated the company as a long-term buy, but the share price had risen
too fast.
Leading pharmaceutical stocks were holding their own after a bout of
weakness earlier in the week. Glaxo was unchanged at 661p and Wellcome,
which is to report first-half figures on March 24, rose a penny to 627p.
However, Goldman Sachs argues that concerns over the headline drugs Zovirax
and Retrovir will lead to further weakness in the shares.
Rolls-Royce held steady at 179 1/2 p with the support of a buy
recommendation from Williams de Broe.

FT  12 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Forte speculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was further strong speculation that Forte may be about to announce the
purchase of the French-owned hotel chain Meridien after a French news agency
reported the two sides were in discussions. Air France, which owns a
majority stake in the 53-strong chain, is said to be entertaining offers
with several other international hotel groups said to have expressed an
interest.
The rumour helped depress Forte's share price as the market fretted over the
possibility of a rights issue. They closed off 9 at 255p with turnover a
lowly 2.2m. However, analysts pointed out that a large proportion of
Meridien's hotels are operated on management contracts, with the equity
being owned by outside investors, a fact that would reduce the price of any
prospective deal. Should Forte emerge as the buyer of Meridien, it would go
some way to making up for the disappointment of losing the deal for Ciga,
the luxury Italian chain, last month.

FT  12 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Dividend hopes lift Barclays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Increasing optimism about Barclays Bank's dividend paying capacity prompted
another powerful performance by the bank's shares which extended Thursday's
late rally. News that Goldman Sachs, the influential US investment bank, had
added Barclays shares to its list of best buys helped to boost the stock.
Mr Rod Barrett, Goldman's UK banks specialist, said both Barclays and
Natwest were cheap stocks in the sector. He said the appointment of Mr
Martin Taylor as Barclays' new chief executive was an 'influence for the
positive' and he expected the bank to build from a base of lower provisions.
The Goldman recommendation was preceded by sustained and heavy buying of
Barclays. Other big broking houses, such as Lehman Brothers, were also said
to have been recommending the shares.
However, news that Standard &amp; Poor's, the US debt-rating agency had placed
its double 'A' senior debt ratings for Barclays on creditwatch took the
shares down from the day's high of 536p. They closed 9 up at 519p on
turnover of 24m. S &amp; P said Barclays' underlying profitability was
satisfactory but provisions were high and there appeared to be further
deterioration of asset quality in Europe and the US.
NatWest responded to Goldman's positive stance, ending the session
marginally higher at 467p.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Markets Report: Dollar slides
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar continued its slide on foreign exchanges yesterday to touch its
lowest level in four months, writes Philip Gawith.
The US currency continues to suffer from the political fallout of the
Whitewater scandal and closed in London at DM1.6779, down from DM1.6893 on
Thursday.
Further undermining the dollar was an upward revision in Germany's January
M3 figure, to an annualised 21.2 per cent from 20.6 per cent, which could
slow the decline in German interest rates.
Sterling was also weaker, pulled down by the dollar and worse than
anticipated December trade figures. The trade weighted index fell to 80.5
from 81.
The dollar fell yesterday when the Commerce Department reported February US
retail sales rose 1.5 per cent after a downward revision in the January
figure to a 1.6 per cent decline. The figures cancelled each other out, but
the vulnerable dollar lost ground anyway.
Although the Bundesbank deputy president Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum said the
upward revision of German M3 figures was 'economically insignificant', it
did cause heavy selling pressure on the dollar.
The dollar closed slightly weaker against the yen at Y105.125 from Y105.695
on Thursday. Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, said
the Bank of Japan continued to support the dollar when it fell below Y105. A
slight cooling of the trade dispute between the two countries had also taken
some pressure off the exchange rate.
Sterling fell by nearly a pfennig and a half to close at DM2.521 from
DM2.5364. Part of the weakness was attributable to weaker than expected
trade figures. The visible trade deficit rose to Pounds 1.57bn in December
from Pounds 1.28bn in November.
The trade figures, however, only gave added impetus to an already weak
sterling.
Mr Stuart Frost, technical analyst at Natwest Treasury, said the fall in
sterling was a 'dollar inspired move'. Going back to October, every time
sterling has reached the Dollars 1.50/1.51 level, it has been sold off.
This selling pressure then spills over into the Pounds /D-Mark rate too. He
said that when sterling breached the important DM2.53 support level - before
the trade figures were released - this had prompted aggressive selling from
technical operators.
Deteriorating sentiment about the interest rate outlook was also reflected
in the futures market. The June short sterling contract fell by five points
to 94.85, indicating that the market only anticipates a 10 basis point fall
in interest rates by the middle of the year.
Aggravating matters has been the strength of the D-Mark which has firmed on
the perception that the Bundesbank will only cut rates slowly.
The D-Mark had a quiet day in Europe ending marginally weaker against the
French franc at FFr3.402 from FFr3.404. It was stronger against the Italian
lira, finishing at L990.9 from L990.1
Liquidity conditions in the discount market were fairly easy with the
overnight rate fluctuating between 3 3/4 per cent and 6 per cent. The Bank
put Pounds 1.112bn liquidity into the system compared to its forecast of a
Pounds 1.45bn shortage, revised up from Pounds 1.35bn.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): US funds fuel gold price
rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The gold price recovered from an early set back this week to end near the
top of its recent trading range.
After a neutral start the market was undermined on Tuesday by news that
Japan was planning to sell about 90 tonnes of melted-down surplus gold
coins. A three months low of Dollars 375.35 a troy ounce was quickly reached
and, after a tentative rally, was undercut by another 5 cents the following
morning.
But that proved to be the trigger for a salvo of trade buying and
short-covering that lifted the price to Dollars 379.55 by Wednesday's close
and to Dollars 385 a day later. A five-week high of Dollars 387.10 an ounce
was set at yesterday morning's London bullion market price fixing, but by
the close profit-taking had trimmed that to Dollars 387, up Dollars 10.50 on
the week.
The price surge had been fuelled, traders said, by options-realted buying in
New York and by funds seeking a haven as the Whitewater rumours rocked US
bond, equity and currency markets. Another bullish influence was growing
concern about the political situation in South Africa in the run-up to next
month's elections.
That last factor was still more potent for the platinum market, especially
with regard to the homeland of Bophuthatswana, which accounts for 30 per
cent of South African mine production of the metal, equating to about 20 per
cent of world output.
The London platinum price was fixed at a seven-month high of Dollars 405.50
an ounce yesterday morning, but was pared back in the afternoon to Dollars
403.75, up Dollars 12,25 on the week.
Silver also joined in the fun, aided by increasing interest from US
investment funds. The London cash price ended the week 19 1/2 cents higher
at Dollars 4.03 3/4 an ounce.
London Metal Exchange copper traders, having twice failed to breach Dollars
1,920 a tonne for the three months delivery position and subsequently tested
the solidity of support below Dollars 1,900, finally succeeded yesterday in
their efforts to gain a foothold in higher ground. The price closed at
Dollars 1,929 a tonne, up Dollars 22.50 on the day and Dollars 15 on the
week.
Dealers told the Reuter news agency that the late surge, which was
encouraged by a big fall in exchange warehouse stocks and a slight narrowing
in the cash discount, or 'contango', could have set the market up for a push
towards Dollars 1,950 a tonne.
Aluminium was also firmer yesterday, though the three months delivery
position's Dollars 14 rise to Dollars 1,299.50 a tonne still left it Dollars
3 down on the week. The market was aided by confirmation of an 8,000-tonnes
a year output cut at Norway's Soer-Norge smelter, although earlier in the
week it had taken little cheer from news of a planned 20,000 tonnes a year
cut by Aluminium Bahrain, the Gulf's largest producer and the first to back
multilateral efforts to balance the market.
The London Commodity Exchange robusta coffee market was trying to
consolidate yesterday after a a sustained rise had run into upside
resistance. The May futures position touched a three-month peak of Dollars
1,285 on Thursday and again yesterday before closing at Dollars 1,275 a
tonne, up Dollars 26 on the week.
'The market is still looking in good shape if we can consolidate around
here,' one trader commented.
The initial uptrend had led some traders to suggest that a rise to Dollars
1,300 was possible, but others had foreseen that there would be strong
resistance in the Dollars 1,280-Dollars 1,288 range.

FT  12 MAR 94 / International Company News: Grumman shares soar 18%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Grumman rose 18 per cent yesterday as Wall Street prepared for a
Dollars 2bn bid battle over the defence contractor between Martin Marietta,
which launched an agreed takeover on Monday, and Northrop, which unveiled a
hostile offer on Thursday night.
Grumman shares, which started the month at Dollars 37 1/2 , soared a further
Dollars 9 7/8 to Dollars 64 3/4 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange
following Northrop's cash offer of Dollars 60 a share, valuing the group at
Dollars 2.04bn.
Mr Peter Aseritis, an analyst at First Boston, said that 'a bidding war
could result in a winning bid that does not make economic sense'.
Martin Marietta said it would respond to Northrop's bid 'in an appropriate
manner at the appropriate time'.
Hostile bids are unusual in the defence sector, and Martin Marietta
complained that 'the attack by Northrop degrades the entire character of the
rational consolidation taking place within the US's national security
industrial base'.
Northrop coupled Thursday's bid with an attack on Grumman's board for
entering into a deal with Martin Marietta, even though Northrop and Grumman
had spent months in late 1993 and early 1994 discussing a friendly merger.
It complained that Grumman had neither informed Northrop it was in
negotiations with another party or invited the company's best bid.
It described as 'improper and illegal' a so-called lock-up agreement, under
which Grumman will pay Martin Marietta Dollars 50m if its offer for the
company is outbid.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Survey of Residential Property (9): Sweet dreams that can
turn into nightmares - So you've got your gold watch and now you want a
proper garden. Don't let sentiment take over / Gardens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Retirement offers every keen gardener the sweetest of dreams. No longer will
gardening be slotted into weekends and those summer evenings when, for a
marvel, the train is on time. Retirement opens a prospect of unhurried days
and years. Even so, before throwing yourself into an orgy of improvements,
it is worth taking an unsentimental look at your garden and its
surroundings. Does it really merit your energies for the rest of your
gardening days?
Just as a significant proportion of couples decide, on reaching retirement,
that life could be a good deal pleasanter with a new partner, the same is
true of the garden. Although it might be painful in the short term, parting
from your old garden could be vastly better than slogging on with a hopeless
case.
Think about the features of your present garden that no amount of time and
money will change. Is it sun-less? Does it lie in a frost pocket, year after
year frustrating your ambition to send superb apples to the local flower
show? If it has hungry, stony soil or back-straining clay, does it really
deserve more years of struggle?
But as in the search for a new human partner, however, it behoves you to be
circumspect when choosing a new one. Otherwise, you could end up in a worse
plight than before.
First, there is the soil. Gardeners who are house-hunting should insist on
making several substantial test digs around the place. One probe is not
enough because it is sod's law (literally) that you will dig at the only
patch of workable soil.
Light is a trickier factor. House-hunting in winter can disguise the fact
that, in the summer, umbrageous trees to the south may take most or all of
the sun.
Even if that does not concern you horticulturally, it could matter very much
if basking in a conservatory was part of the plan. And if the new house is
in a conservation area, or if the trees have a local authority protection
order, you will be prevented from felling them - or even pruning them
heavily.
Few people recognise that summer house-hunting also has drawbacks. It is
important to think ahead to winter and work out the angles for those months
when the sun hangs low. Otherwise, your new garden could overshadowed by
surrounding buildings. Crocuses will never open and the soil will remain
cold late into spring.
If you are house-hunting in winter and spring, many things may go
undetected. Only the growing season will reveal if the borders are riddled
with couch grass, bindweed and ground elder. That is why the general feel of
a garden, kempt or unkempt, pruned or left wild, is so revealing.
Anyone who is not yet a good gardener, but means to become so in retirement,
would do well to take a knowledgeable friend to view the short-listed
gardens and look for signs of criminal neglect. It is unlikely that borders
gone wild would put you off buying a lovely property, but at least you would
know to expect the worst.
Once the most thuggish weeds have run amok through a border and tightened
their stranglehold on roses, paths and box hedges, there is no way you will
ever get rid of them without starting again.
This means hard work: lifting plants, replacing them if they are
inextricably weed-bound, and using weed-killer (unless you are absurdly
namby-pamby and propose to devote years to the job). Reclaiming a garden
from the worst kinds of perennial weeds will be neither cheap nor quick.
The matter of whether the soil is acid or alkaline is crucial only to
gardeners who have a particular passion for certain plant families. Whatever
is growing already in a garden or its surrounds probably will show whether
gentians or rhododendrons are to be part of your new gardening life.
These are deep matters, which matter to gardeners alone. Do not expect
estate agents to be any help in tracking down a garden for your golden
afternoons. Even so, when I toyed with finding a cottage in the Cotswolds
last year, it was a shock to find how feeble they were. Awareness of
Britain's most popular leisure activity has yet to impinge on your average
chap with a clip-board. I was on the books of eight agents, not one with
software allowing it to specify that I should receive particulars only of
gardens above my minimum acceptable size. Two-thirds of particulars gave no
indication of the area of garden with a property.
Even more infuriating was that, when I rang agents, they often had no
precise idea of the size of the gardens they were handling. Rather than take
measurements, they preferred to suggest you made a time-consuming journey to
see for yourself.
My own house in central Oxford has an unusually large, south-facing garden
for the area. Yet, when thinking of selling, I had to insist on the
particulars being reprinted to include the measurements and a brief
description of the garden.
All the same, it is worth pondering the crucial matter of how big a garden
you want for retirement. Something larger is tempting: finally, you might
think, here is the chance to make a water garden, grow alpines in raised
beds, or plant an orchard. But there is the problem of time and Time.
Time with a small 't' simply means not under-estimating how busy you could
still be, even in retirement. Again, the life partner enters into it.
By now, it will be apparent whether he or she is a gardener. If not, it is
hardly tactful to start making a still bigger garden - which, inevitably,
would occupy much of your energies - when the non-gardening spouse's
perception of retirement was travelling the world and seeing more of the
family.
Then, there is the larger question of Time. Good gardeners know it already
but novices never do: a new garden is a slow business. It takes 10 years
before an orchard gives a reasonable return, four years before old roses
start to perform well, and the same for a newly-planted herbaceous border to
start looking like the picture in your mind's eye.
Retirement should usher in two decades or so of vigorous activity. But
gardeners who are perfectionists by nature have to accept that they make a
rod for their own backs if they take on too big a plot. As the joints begin
to stiffen, it is always possible to resort more and more to hired labour.
But if part of the charm of finishing work was to get away from dealing with
personnel problems, it is perhaps not the best idea to make them an integral
part of your retirement scenario. Even with a large and challenging garden,
it is extremely hard to find knowledgeable, hard-working, full-time
gardeners in sympathy with the owner's own tastes.
All in all, then, it might be sensible to be circumspect when hunting for
the retirement garden and scaling down, not up. This need not mean loss of
face or less challenging gardening - quite the reverse if you start to
specialise.
Vic Dickson-Cohen, one of the best gardeners in retirement I know, has given
up most of his plot in north London to raising alpines by using a
low-maintenance, professional-standard alpine house. It means he can garden
whatever the weather and round the clock, making even winter bright with his
hardy cyclamen collection.
The maker, CJ Waterhouse, of Buckhurst Works, Bells Yew Green, Tunbridge
Wells (0892-750247), sells mostly to customers buying for their retirement.
They pay around Pounds 3,700 (plus VAT) for a complete 10ft by 8ft alpine
house.
If stopping work leaves no outlet for the competitive instinct, growing for
the show bench is the answer. New worlds of skill and one-upmanship can be
opened through membership of, say, the Royal Horticultural Society or the
Hardy Plant Society, or more specialised groups such as the National
Auricula and Primula Societies, the Pot Leek Society - even the oddly-named
Mammillaria Society.
The RHS will supply the addresses; its own Horticultural Shows' Handbook is
a guide to the cut and thrust of wickedly competitive gardening in
retirement.

FT  12 MAR 94 / International Company News: Norsk Hydro to raise NKr5bn by
rights issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Norsk Hydro, the Norwegian energy and fertilisers group, is raising up to
NKr5bn (Dollars 676m) - some 10 per cent of its stock market value - through
an international rights issue, to strengthen financial flexibility.
Hydro intends to use the proceeds to reduce interest-bearing debt, finance
expansion and invest in new North Sea oil and pipeline projects.
The government has recommended that the state, which holds 51 per cent of
Hydro's share capital, participate with NKr2.6bn to maintain its 51 per cent
stake in the company.
Hydro could conceivably raise NKr600m in the domestic market, where 15.5 per
cent of its share capital is held, and the remaining NKr1.8bn in foreign
markets, where 33.5 per cent of shares are traded.
Mr Jens Stoltenberg, Industry and Energy Minister, said he was confident the
state would win the necessary approval from the Storting (parliament) to
participate in the move. It intended to table a proposal before Easter to
enable the issue to take place in June.
The state's shareholding in Hydro would be reduced to 45 per cent if it did
not acquire new shares.
Proceeds of the issue are to be used to reduce interest-bearing debt from
NKr24bn to between NKr15bn and NKr20bn. Hydro also plans to spend about
NKr8bn annually over the next five years, partly to finance participation in
North Sea oil and pipeline projects.
Expansion opportunities are also being sought in Asia and in downstream
businesses.
Hydro's last rights issue was in 1988, when it raised NKr2.5bn. Since 1988,
the company has invested NKr50bn. Half of this has been related to oil and
gas projects, which have since doubled Hydro's production to around 9.4m
tonnes of oil equivalent in 1993.
Last year, Hydro made a net profit of NKr1.2bn - excluding gains from the
disposal of a stake in Freia Marabou, the Norwegian chocolate producer -
against NKr1.8bn in 1992.

FT  12 MAR 94 / International Company News: Japanese broker warns of
write-off
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kankaku Securities, the Japanese broker, is to write off Y50bn (Dollars
472.4m) in losses stemming from illicit client transactions. It will slide
further into the red as a result.
Mr Yoichiro Kato, Kankaku's president, said the broker would suffer a
pre-tax loss of Y77bn for the year ending this month, against Y51bn a year
ago. It had earlier forecast a pre-tax profit of Y300m.
Kankaku, one of Japan's 10 so-called second-tier brokers, expects to incur a
net loss of Y76bn. It will again omit the dividend.
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, the big commercial bank which holds a 4.9 per cent
stake in Kankaku, will provide the broker with Y70bn in subordinated loans.
The announcement follows last year's bail-out by Daiwa Bank of Cosmo
Securities, which was hit by heavy losses due to illegal share deals. Cosmo
became the first Japanese broker to be rescued by a bank.
The two rescue moves come as the country's medium-sized and small brokers
continue to suffer from the effects of a shake-out in the Tokyo stock
market. During the stock market boom of the late 1980s, some brokers had
aspired to rise to the ranks of the Big Four - Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and
Yamaichi - and expanded rapidly, making large capital investments.
Where possible, Japan's ministry of finance is determined to prop up weak
brokers and banks to preserve confidence in the Japanese financial markets.
Financial bureaucrats are pushing larger and healthier banks and brokers to
help weaker counterparts to restructure.
Support plans for other second-tier brokers are expected shortly. Sanyo
Securities, the most aggressive of the medium-sized brokers, is currently at
the last stages of negotiations with its creditor banks - Bank of Tokyo,
Daiwa Bank, and Nippon Credit Bank - and Nomura Securities, its leading
shareholder. It may announce a restructuring next week.
Kankaku said several employees arranged trades to shift loss-carrying
securities held by some of the company's leading clients to other customer
accounts between 1986 and 1990.
The Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission, Japan's securities
watchdog, yesterday advised the ministry of finance to take punitive action
against Kankaku over the illegal deals.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft, the troubled German metals and energy group, has sold
its remaining 6 per cent stake in Methanex, the world's biggest methanol
producer. The disposal is part of the group's drive to raise cash by
disposing of peripheral businesses.
Metallgesellschaft raised CDollars 127m (USDollars 94m) from its shares,
which were sold in a block trade on the Toronto stock exchange by a
syndicate of Canadian securities dealers led by Gordon Capital. A Gordon
official said the shares were widely distributed.
Until early last year, it had a 32 per cent controlling stake in Methanex,
which is based in Vancouver. However, it has gradually reduced its interest
over the past year.
Methanex's single biggest shareholder is now Nova, the Calgary-based
pipeline and chemicals group, with a 24 per cent interest. New Zealand's
Fletcher Challenge, which was a big shareholder in Methanex, also decided
last year to withdraw from the methanol business.
Metallgesellschaft is reviewing many of its investments as part of efforts
to recover from the huge losses suffered in international oil trading.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mazda, the Japanese carmaker, expects non-consolidated pre-tax losses for
this year to be substantially heavier than forecast.
The company said losses would widen to Y45bn (Dollars 425.3m) from a
previously-estimated Y32bn. It blamed a steeper-than-expected downturn in
the domestic market, and the adverse impact of the yen's appreciation. Sales
are expected to be Y1,770bn rather than the Y1,890bn forecast in November.
Mazda, 24.5 per cent-owned by Ford Motor of the US, has already announced
its intention to pass its dividend.
This is the third time the carmaker has been forced to revise its forecast
for this year. Mazda said that while it had made strenuous efforts to reduce
costs by between 20 and 30 per cent, this had not been sufficient to cover
the weaker sales.
In the domestic market, Mazda saw unit sales fall from 460,200 to 400,000.
While Japanese carmakers have generally suffered amid the domestic economic
slump, Mazda has been one of the hardest hit.

FT  12 MAR 94 / International Company News: Banesto contest opened to
foreigners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European banks are to be allowed to bid for control of Banco Espanol de
Credito (Banesto), the troubled Spanish bank for which the Bank of Spain is
mounting a rescue operation.
European Union regulations have forced the Madrid authorities to change
plans which would have ensured that Banesto, with a network of 2,500
branches, stayed in Spanish hands. Bids for the bank were to have been
restricted to banks participating in Spain's Deposit Guarantee Fund, which
is bearing much of the burden of the rescue operation.
However, Mr Luis Angel Rojo, Bank of Spain governor, yesterday told a
parliamentary committee investigating the Banesto affair that these plans
had been abandoned because they would breach European Union rules.
The change also means Argentaria, the state-controlled banking group, can
compete on an equal footing with other bidders. The conditions previously
under discussion were expected to force Argentaria to pay a premium, since
it only began contributing to the fund in 1991.
Argentaria is one of three Spanish banks to have declared an interest in
Banesto, alongside Banco Bilbao Vizcaya and Banco Santander. There is also
speculation about a consortium bid by savings banks.
The deadline for bids has been set for April 25, with a decision due to be
announced on May 9.
The Deposit Guarantee Fund is to plough Pta285bn (Dollars 2bn) into Banesto,
with half coming from the banking sector and half from the Bank of Spain.
The fund will also provide an interest-free loan to Banesto of about
Pta300bn, and will initially subscribe to a Pta180bn capital increase,
making up 73 per cent of Banesto's restructured equity base.
Would-be buyers will have to bid for the whole of this stake and commit
themselves to keeping a fixed proportion.

FT  12 MAR 94 / International Company News: Trygg-Hansa returns to black
</HEADLINE>

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Trygg-Hansa SPP, the Swedish insurer, rebounded to an operating profit of
SKr1.72bn (Dollars 215.3m) in 1993 from a SKr5.14bn deficit the year before.
The insurer has left behind huge losses associated with the country's
banking crisis and begun to disengage from reinsurance.
The result followed a similar turnround announced earlier this week by
Skandia, Sweden's other big insurance group. It posted a record operating
profit in 1993 of SKr2.01bn. Trygg is to pay a dividend of SKr3.00 per share
after suspending the payout last year.
The main factor in Trygg's turnround was the non-recurring SKr6.03 loss
incurred in 1992, when the group's large holdings in Gota AB, the holding
company of state-rescued Gota Bank, and two collapsed credit insurers were
written down to zero.
However, Trygg also benefited in 1993 from a 77 per cent improvement in its
insurance result, which rose to a profit of SKr890m from SKr502m, and a leap
in investment income to SKr1.1bn from SKr133m.
Trygg said a significant factor in the insurance result was a drop in losses
from reinsurance, reached SKr470m in 1992, in part due to the cost of its
exposure to Hurrican Andrew. The group stopped writing new reinsurance
business in October last year.

FT  12 MAR 94 / International Company News: ABN Amro to lift dividend by 5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ABN Amro, the Netherlands' largest bank, is to raise its 1993 dividend by
slightly more than 5 per cent, after posting a 20 per cent increase in net
profit last year.
Net profit rose to Fl 2.02bn (Dollars 1.05bn) from Fl 1.68bn in 1992, with
European operations contributing by far the largest percentage increase in
growth. The dividend is to be raised to Fl 3.05 per share from Fl 2.90.
Mr Robert Hazelhoff, chairman, said results improved across the board last
year. '(But) the icing on the cake was the exceptional year for equities,'
he said.
Total revenue rose 13.4 per cent to Fl 14.1bn, outstripping the 10.8 per
cent increase in total costs, to Fl 10.9bn.
Pre-tax operating results in Europe surged almost three-fold, to Fl 442m
from Fl 117m. This easily surpassed the 12.3 per cent increase in ABN Amro's
home market. However, the bank's Dutch business is far larger in absolute
terms, accounting for Fl 1.97bn out of the group's total operating profits
of Fl 3.17bn.
In the US, the bank's second most important market, pre-tax operating profit
rose only 0.4 per cent to Fl 532m. This limited rise was due to provisions,
already reported at mid-year, to cover risks in debt securities. Without the
item, US profits would have been up nearly 24 per cent.
Overall, foreign operations posted a combined 47.7 per cent increase in
operating profit.
Mr Hazelhoff said ABN Amro was reaping the rewards of acquisitions of
European stockbrokers.

FT  12 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Vivat improves to Pounds 3.43m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Vivat Holdings, the maker of jeans and casual wear, mainly under the Lee
Cooper brand name, lifted pre-tax profits to Pounds 3.43m in the year to
December 31 1993, against a restated Pounds 1.95m.
Turnover improved to Pounds 71.2m (Pounds 67.6m), influenced by favourable
currency movements, and generated operating profits of Pounds 5.42m (Pounds
4.36m).
A saving in overheads which resulted from the closure of the group's German
business, together with a significant reduction of bad debts in Spain,
compensated for the cost of restructuring the French sales force and an
increase in marketing expenditure, the company said.
However, with difficult trading conditions in its principal markets, the
company had a long way to go to match the profit levels of the early 1980s.
The proposed single dividend is raised to 1.25p (1p), payable from earnings
of 3.5p (2p).

FT  12 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Building a closer customer relationship -
How Girobank is changing the face of the Alliance &amp; Leicester
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Given the slightly cosy and domestic image of building societies, it seems
appropriate that one society chief executive should try to explain the
relationship between Alliance &amp; Leicester, the UK's fourth largest society,
and its Girobank subsidiary, in familial terms.
'It's like having a teenage child living at home and bringing in a large
slice of the family income, but having no say in the decisions,' he says.
The slice of income brought in by Girobank has been impressive. In 1993, it
amounted to Pounds 75m of A&amp;L's Pounds 205m pre-tax profits, while the
previous year it contributed just over half of the pre-tax profits of Pounds
122.5m.
Indeed, the contribution goes beyond the obvious pre-tax profits, since
Girobank also pays dividends into the main group accounts.
In 1992, it accounted for most of the Pounds 37.5m income from shares in
subsidiaries which was attributed to the society. In 1991, it contributed
almost Pounds 30m in a similar form. These were substantial amounts,
particularly in 1991 when the society was suffering heavy losses on its
commercial lending.
The purchase of Girobank from the Post Office in 1990 for Pounds 112m thus
looks like a bargain in more ways than one.
'We bought Girobank because we felt we needed a current account,' says Mr
Peter White, now group chief executive. 'It was a question then of getting a
long-term strategy for where we wanted to be in retail financial services.
Having bought Girobank, we were much more relationship-driven.'
In bringing to the fore this greater emphasis on relationship with the
customer rather than on product, the link with Girobank was one of the
driving forces behind the group's strategic review.
The strategy, based on advice from Gemini consultants, was agreed by the A&amp;L
board in April last year, and the process of implementation has continued
since - though there is still some way to go.
The first change most customers are likely to notice will be in May, when
Girobank's 1.4m personal customers are moved into A&amp;L, though they will
still be able to use post office facilities and telephone banking services.
Soon after that, a new current account - the Alliance account - will be
launched, as a further stage in the integration process.
The move will roughly halve Girobank's balance sheet, as retail savings
worth about Pounds 1bn are transferred to A&amp;L. This has the added benefit of
giving A&amp;L extra liquidity which will stand it in good stead for the
recovery of the mortgage market.
It will also provide greatly enhanced opportunities for cross-selling
financial products to different groups of customers, as the overlap between
A&amp;L and Girobank customers is relatively small.
Mr White sees this as one of the key tasks for the coming months: 'It will
take us another year to get complete cross-selling,' he says.
Girobank, itself, will be left with its fixed assets, a small amount of
commercial lending and its profitable money transmission operation.
Though Mr White insists that no decision has been taken, there must be a
question of how far the successful cash transmission business - high in
volume but low in margin - will belong in the future within an organisation
intended to focus on its relationship with personal customers.
Mr John Wriglesworth, societies' analyst at UBS, says that the remaining
parts of Girobank are now in a state when they could be packaged up: the
money transmission business could well fetch more than the whole
organisation cost A&amp;L in 1990, he suggests.
The role of two other, minor, subsidiaries is easier to see in a
relationship-driven A&amp;L. Both A&amp;L personal finance, the unsecured loan
subsidiary, and A&amp;L estate agency have a rationale within that concept, and
both are likely to be maintained as separate operations.
In the drive towards customer relationships and cross-selling, the greatest
question which A&amp;L has yet to decide is its strategy for moving into
insurance and equity products. At present the society acts as a tied agent
for Scottish Amicable, a life insurance company.
'We'll know what we want to do within the year,' Mr White says. Unless A&amp;L
is out of kilter with the trend elsewhere in the sector, the assumption must
be that it will probably set up its own life company in order to have
greater control of the products it sells.
Mr White argues that the amount of management time and effort devoted to the
review over the past couple of years has not really cost the society
anything as, in his words, 'there's been no mortgage market'.
The cost may have been, however, in terms of a delay in any ambitions in
converting the group into a plc. Two years ago the society was already being
tipped as likely to follow Abbey National which converted to plc status in
1989.
While those prospects were delayed because of the commercial lending losses,
Mr White's stance now is that there is nothing the society wants to do that
it cannot do while retaining its mutual status, given that the Building
Societies Commission, the statutory regulator, 'seems willing to be flexible
in its approach'.
His view may well change as competition increases further in both mortgage
and savings markets.
In those circumstances, A&amp;L would not have the two or three years of good,
sustainable results behind it that any society would want as a basis for
conversion, and it may well be that the investment in the strategy will not
be reflected fully until the 1995 results.
At present it looks as though it will be worth the wait.

FT  12 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Sainsbury to axe 650 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
J Sainsbury, the UK's biggest grocery retailer, is cutting about 650 jobs in
its head and area offices over the next eight months as part of a
restructuring of its business.
The company had warned in January - when it announced a fall in gross profit
margins and underlying sales - that job losses could not be ruled out as a
result of a business review carried out in conjunction with external
consultants.
Yesterday's announcement follows a similar move by Tesco, the UK's
second-biggest supermarket group, which said last month it was cutting 800
full-time jobs.
Sainsbury said the aim was to 'concentrate effort on providing outstanding
service throughout all parts of the business and to simplify and rationalise
operations and eliminate overlaps'.
The job losses, together with a series of other initiatives in Sainsbury's
head and area offices, are expected to lead to annual cost savings of about
Pounds 50m. Sainsbury expects to make a provision of between Pounds 10m and
Pounds 20m to cover the redundancy costs in its current year results.

FT  12 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Design side spending limits Abbott Mead to
Pounds 4.75m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Abbott Mead Vickers, the advertising group, yesterday reported a slight
increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.75m for the year to December 31
against Pounds 4.72m in 1992.
The figure, which disappointed analysts, was held back by investment in the
group's design subsidiary, McBain Noel-Johnson, where profits fell from
Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 1m. Excluding this expenditure, AMV said group
operating profit was up 26 per cent, on an underlying basis.
The shares closed down 22p at 708p.
Group turnover increased by almost 20 per cent to Pounds 201.2m (Pounds
167.9m).
Earnings per share were static at 18.7p but confidence about prospects for
1994 means the board is recommending a final dividend of 7.3p making a total
of 10.5p, a 12.9 per cent increase.
AMV had a record year for new business wins, which totalled Pounds 70m of
billings on an annualised basis. Gains included Gossard, Ever Ready,
Tambrands, Gillette and British Gas.
Mr David Abbott, chairman, said 1994 had started exceptionally well, with
new business totalling over Pounds 75m on an annualised basis.
A British Telecommunications contract, worth Pounds 50m in annual billings,
is described by AMV as the 'largest single new business win in the history
of British advertising'. The group is currently pitching for business which
would be worth Pounds 76m in billings.
Mr Peter Mead, chief executive, said there were 'real signs of growth' in
client spending. 'I don't see any requirement to be gloomy any more,' he
said.
Investment in the development of electronic systems which will allow images
and words for advertising campaigns to be manipulated on a computer network
by clients in their own offices, is already yielding new business, including
a three-year, fixed-fee contract with Delta Airlines.

FT  12 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Lawnmower buy for Tomkins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tomkins, the UK-based conglomerate, is making its first acquisition since
its Pounds 990m takeover of food group Ranks Hovis McDougall in December
1992.
It is paying about Dollars 115m (Pounds 78m) for the lawnmower and
snowblower businesses of Noma Industries, a quoted Canadian group.
Mr Greg Hutchings, chief executive, described it as 'an excellent bolt-on'
to Murray Ohio, the group's US lawnmower manufacturer.
'It is a smaller competitor with a complementary range of lawnmowers. The
snowblowers, which are about 25 per cent of turnover, give us some counter
seasonal activity.'
Tomkins is paying less than asset value for the businesses which had sales
of Dollars 239.4m last year. Tomkins has agreed not to disclose what, if
any, profits it made but Mr Hutchings admitted it had been 'struggling'.
It has two modern factories in Tennessee and one in Brampton, Ontario. Most
of the sales are in the US with the rest split between Canada and Europe.
Mr David Lang, an analyst at brokers Henderson Crosthwaite, said: 'It will
ease Murray Ohio's capacity shortage in America and gives them a window into
Canada.'
Mr Hutchings would not comment on plans for the Noma plants or quantify the
likely job losses. But, he said: 'It will be self-financing once we get to
grips with it.'
The consideration, which will be at a fixed discount of Dollars 11.75m to
net assets, will be met from existing cash resources which stood at Pounds
170m in October. Tomkins will also assume Dollars 16.7m of long-term debt
and operating lease liabilities of Dollars 12.4m.
The businesses consist of Outdoor Products, which makes and distributes of
power mowers, garden tractors and snowblowers, and Dynamark Plastics, a
small custom injection moulder, which supplies Outdoor Products and other
Noma Industries businesses.
Competition in the US lawnmower market has been fierce and in the six months
to October Tomkins said Murray Ohio had made volume gains at the expense of
lower margins.

FT  12 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Wellington valued at Pounds 48.5m in stock
market flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Wellington Holdings, the seals and rubber products group which is
coming to the stock market, have been priced at almost 20 times pro forma
1993 earnings.
The rating is a premium to both Avon Rubber, the nearest comparable company,
and to the engineering sector.
Mr John Herring, of sponsors Kleinwort Benson Securities, said the pricing
reflected strong demand from institutions. 'It seemed to catch their
imaginations, partly because it is an easy to understand manufacturing
business which is quite rare among new issues these days.'
Mr Peter Chaffin, chief executive, said: 'We are really chuffed both at the
price and at the reception.'
Just over half of Wellington's shares are being placed with institutions at
205p, valuing its enlarged equity at Pounds 48.5m.
The company is raising Pounds 13.5m net of expenses while First Britannia,
the venture capital fund which owned 90 per cent of the existing shares, is
selling shares worth Pounds 10m. Its stake will fall to 40 per cent.
Directors and senior managers, who have just bought shares from First
Britannia for a nominal sum prior to the float, are selling shares worth
almost Pounds 800,000. They will be left with 8.6 per cent.
Wellington's operating profit increased by almost 26 per cent to Pounds 4.2m
last year generating earnings per share of 8.26p. That rises to 10.35p on a
pro forma basis. The notional dividend for 1993 was 5.17p for a yield at the
placing price of 3.15 per cent.
Commenting on the outlook for the current year, the company said that 1993
had ended 'encouragingly' with the order book 30 per cent higher than a year
earlier. 'The directors are confident that the prospects for 1994 are good
with organic growth anticipated across each of the group's three divisions.'
Dealings in the shares will start on March 21.

FT  12 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Mercury units close at modest discount
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercury's European privatisation investment trust units slipped to a modest
6.8 per cent discount against their offer price when dealings in packages of
five shares with one warrant attached began trading yesterday.
The units closed at 468p compared with the 500p offer price with a
relatively low 2.25m units changing hands. Separate trading in the shares
and warrants is due to begin on April 25.
The Mercury trust was less than Pounds 4m oversubscribed when it closed
earlier this month, but still became the largest investment trust ever
launched. Its maximum size was set at Pounds 575m after Pounds 325m had been
raised in a placing with institutional investors.
Mr Jonathan Ruck Keene, director of Mercury Asset Management Private
Clients, said the modest discount reflected market conditions and was not
surprising. 'It is what you would expect on a day like today,' he said,
adding that the discount was in line with trading in shares of the similar
Kleinwort European privatisation trust which was launched last month.
Shares in the substantially oversubscribed Pounds 500m Kleinwort trust, in
effect, closed at a slight 4 per cent premium to their offer price when they
began trading in February but have since slipped back.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Readymix, the Irish building materials group, saw pre-tax profits decline by
IPounds 660,000 to IPounds 2.33m (Pounds 2.24m) in the year to end-December
1993, on turnover up by 3 per cent from IPounds 30.8m to IPounds 31.7m.
The company said that, despite continuing efforts to minimise its cost base,
lower selling prices and a fall in demand for cement-based products had
eroded margins from 9.7 per cent in 1992 to 7.4 per cent last year.
Earnings per share fell to 5.13p (6.57p).
Nevertheless, an improved final dividend of 2.45p (2.35p) is proposed,
raising the total for the year to 3p (2.9p).

FT  12 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Pharmakopius flotation postponed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The planned flotation of Pharmakopius International has been postponed
because of 'volatility' in the biotechnology sector.
Originally planned for February 16, the flotation had already been pushed
back and yesterday the company admitted it had been shelved 'for the time
being'.
It insisted that the decision did not reflect lack of interest in
Pharmakopius itself from potential investors. 'The interest is there, but a
number of institutions are getting nervous about the sector.'
It pointed to the recent flotation of Chiroscience, a biotechnology company
whose Pounds 100m valuation was criticised as too high by some analysts.
But at 147p Chiroscience's shares are only 3p below the issue price, and
other shares in the sector, notably British Bio-technology, have performed
well in recent weeks.
The company scotched rumours that it had failed to meet the Stock Exchange
requirements for a listing. Unlike many biotechnology companies Pharmakopius
has a profitable trading record.

<TEXT>
Restructuring costs of Pounds 696,000 left Forward Technology Industries
with pre-tax profits for 1993 lower at Pounds 89,000, against Pounds
186,000.
Operating profit was 73 per cent ahead at Pounds 1.34m (Pounds 772,000). The
Sound &amp; Vision audio cassette and CD activity was 26 per cent up while the
electronics side rose 80 per cent.
Mr Brian Chilver, chairman, said that the result was encouraging despite the
recession in Germany and France which had less effect than had been
expected. He added that the restructuring costs were below the Pounds
800,000 anticipated.
The outcome was achieved on turnover 9 per cent higher at Pounds 43.8m
(Pounds 40.2m). After a tax credit of Pounds 93,000 (Pounds 184,000 charge)
earnings per share were 0.5p, against breakeven. The company has decided to
pay a nominal single final dividend of 0.25p.

FT  12 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Headway cuts deficit to Pounds 0.6m in
unseasonal half
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Headway, the consumer and industrial goods manufacturer, reported reduced
pre-tax losses of Pounds 628,000 for the six months ended December 31. The
comparable deficit was Pounds 883,000.
Historically, the group budgets for a loss in the first half because sales
by its dominant garden furniture subsidiary, Aronstead, are heavily biased
towards the final quarter.
All businesses other than Aronstead operated profitably in the first half,
the company said.
Turnover for the six months was 11.6 per cent higher at Pounds 11.2m and at
the operating level the deficit was reduced from Pounds 624,000 to Pounds
397,000.
Mr Andrew Staniland, chairman, said significant improvements had been made
to factory efficiencies in key areas, while working capital and borrowings
had both been kept under tight control. Gearing was reduced to 27.5 per cent
(34.9 per cent).
Reorganisation costs in continuing operations grew slightly to Pounds
130,000 (Pounds 103,000) but this was offset by a fall in net interest
payable to Pounds 101,000 (Pounds 156,000).
Losses per share emerged at 2.6p (3.7p).
In November the group acquired the Stansted Furniture Company, a
manufacturer of flatpack wooden furniture.
It is also to expand its Europa Sofabeds subsidiary by building a new
factory. The existing freehold properties have been sold for Pounds 440,000
 -in line with net book value.

FT  12 MAR 94 / UK Company News: S&amp;P may downgrade Barclays' credit rating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays' return to profitability has failed to impress Standard &amp; Poor's,
the leading US rating agency, which yesterday announced that it was
considering lowering the bank's credit rating.
The move came a day after Barclays announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 664m
for last year, following a 1992 loss of Pounds 242m.
However, Standard &amp; Poor's said it was dissatisfied with the low level of
retained earnings. While a substantial improvement on the previous year's
retained loss of Pounds 586m, Barclays' retained earnings of Pounds 67m were
'quite insignificant for their size,' said Mr Barry Hancock, a director of
S&amp;P.
'We have maintained our rating of AA through the last couple of
disappointing years, on the basis that the bank's strong underlying
performance will enable it to bounce back as earnings pick up, and use
strong retained earnings to strengthen its balance sheet,' Mr Hancock said.
'But we are now concerned that this recovery in performance is still some
way off.'
Barclays lost its triple-A rating from S&amp;P in February 1991, and was
downgraded to AA in June 1992. It is currently rated AA2 by Moody's and AA
by IBCA, which are equivalent ratings.
'I suppose they are worried about the problems in the US, which are the main
reason for low retained earnings, but those problems are firmly in the
past,' said Mr Martin Taylor, Barclays' newly-appointed chief executive. 'I
hope we shall be able to convince the rating agencies that a number of
aspects of the figures, including the tax charge, are very prudently
stated.'
S&amp;P will meet with the management of Barclays in the next few weeks to
discuss the issues involved. The other rating agencies appeared unperturbed
by the Barclays results. 'I would argue that they are roughly what we
expected, or even a little better. Our general view is that we are past the
worst in the UK,' said Mr Robin Monroe-Davies, a managing director of IBCA,
which specialises in bank credit analysis. 'We do not expect to downgrade
any more UK banks.'
Barclays' shares gained 9p to close at 519p.

<TEXT>
Sir, In response to 'Wimp of the species' by Michael Thompson-Noel, our
hearts bleed for him. Where was he in the fight for female equality?
Cowering behind the lines hors de combat with a bad back] Dr Farrell's book
could go down in history as the first categorised as 'social comment' and
'comedy fiction'.
We would suggest that, if men's magazines concentrated on giving men
'special outlets and incentives to express their feelings and perspectives'
rather than gymnastically arranged big-breasted women and Lamborghinis, the
book would be superfluous. In the game of life, women now find themselves
running with the ball, while men lie crumpled in their wake bleating 'high
tackle . . . off-side . . . bad back]'
It's a sad sign of the (financial) times that 20 column inches are expended
on male whittering.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Hillary Agonistes: The maelstrom swirling around President
Clinton's wife
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Washington is Salem,' the veteran lobbyist was quoted as saying about
something else. 'If we're not lynching somebody 24 hours a day in this
wretched town, we're not happy.'
Certainly the noose round Hillary Rodham Clinton's neck must have felt a
little tighter this week, a far cry from the adulation accorded her last
autumn when she took the town and country by storm with the clarity and
vigour of her presentation of the administration's healthcare reform plan,
as much as anybody else's her plan. This legislation finally got a
congressional hearing this week, but only the vested interests were
watching. All other eyes were on Whitewater and this most distinctive first
lady's presumed role at the heart of it.
Hillary's week has seen her portrayed variously as Lady Macbeth, Michael
Millken and Joan of Arc. It is best described in the words of her assailants
and defenders.
On Sunday the New York Times let loose Maureen Dowd on Hillary. Last year,
the Clintons, knowing Ms Dowd is a reporting trendsetter, sought to charm
her and she confessed in print to being charmed.
Not now. She clinically dissects the sources of Hillary Clinton's power,
beyond the relationship with her president husband, and sees them
collapsing. Her healthcare plan is in trouble in Congress; Bernard Nussbaum,
her old colleague on the Watergate prosecution team whom she championed, has
quit as legal counsel; questions are, perhaps cruelly, asked about the
circumstances of the suicide of Vincent Foster, the deputy counsel, her
close friend and former Rose Law Firm partner in Little Rock, Arkansas;
Webster Hubbell, also a Rose graduate, now associate attorney-general, is
under ethical fire.
Ms Dowd lards her story with lethal quotes: the influential, unnamed
Democratic friend of the Clintons who says, 'It's especially hard to run a
White House with no one in charge but two presidents'; the anonymous senior
official who comments, 'No one wants to tell Bill, or especially Hillary,
that they can't do things the way they're used to doing them'; Marlin
Fitzwater, press secretary to presidents Reagan and Bush, who gleefully
twists the knife and cracks, 'Don't say I said anything bad about Hillary,
I'm as scared of her as everyone else'.
The ink barely dry, Vice-President Al Gore, invariably the soul of reason,
goes to bat for her on a morning talk show. He detects a 'generational issue
 -it's relatively new to have a husband and wife who consider themselves
totally equal partners' not only in marriage but in work, including the work
of government. Ms Dowd's picture of the White House, he says, is 'a cartoon
image'.
On Monday the news magazines hit the street. Newsweek is particularly tough
in a big feature called 'Hillary's trouble'. Four of the 10 officials under
subpoena by Robert Fiske, the special counsel, are 'Hillary's employees or
allies'; there are reports of shredded documents at Rose, perhaps ordered by
her.
Again, many of the 'mood' quotes are anonymous but they are hard. 'Advisers
say no staffer wants to be the first to talk bluntly to Mrs Clinton because
of the 'fear wall' around her'. 'For the first time someone has questioned
her skill as a professional,' says an administration official, 'you can see
the pain in her bearing.' Even the firings of the White House chef, a
Frenchman unwilling to meet her taste for American fat-free cuisine, and an
usher, who made Mrs Clinton 'uncomfortable', are ascribed by innuendo to her
intolerance.
At least on Monday afternoon Bill Clinton stood by his woman. 'I believe I'm
a better authority than anyone else in America on my wife. I have never
known a person with a stronger sense of right and wrong in my life - ever.'
So did the National Organisation of Women, which held a rally in support of
her.
Nevertheless, on Tuesday, Mr Clinton brought in Lloyd Cutler, a wise old
Washington bird, as legal counsel. At 76, he needed no new challenges and he
agreed only to take on the job for 130 days - and not be paid for it. One
thing about Mr Cutler is certain: he will not be afraid to tell the
president and first lady what is right and what is wrong, which has been a
problem for many of the Clintonistas around 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. If he
is not heeded, he can walk away, and that would mean real trouble.
By midweek it was impossible for a pundit not to have an opinion about
Hillary. Some tried to have it every which way. Ted Koppel, cerebral host of
ABC's 'Nightline,' declared: 'There is no doubt many of those who oppose the
health plan are only too happy to see Mrs Clinton distracted and weakened by
the Whitewater fiasco. But that doesn't mean the criticism is inappropriate,
unjustified or unworthy of a straightforward answer.'
Anna Quindlen, the New York Times columnist, thought the president came
perilously close to a 'little woman' defence of his wife. Her ironical
conclusion was this: 'Hillary Clinton will once more break new ground, this
time as a presidential adviser-spouse in the midst of a political maelstrom.
It will take a great mind to determine how to play this out. Luckily we have
a great mind in the White House. Unfortunately, she's the one most involved
in the mess.'
In this maelstrom, not many things are certain any more. Some now seem
irrelevant - that, for example, Mrs Clinton is a person of exceptional
intelligence and qualifications with a long-standing interest in the policy
issues that drive her husband's administration. This may puzzle Europeans
accustomed to invisible political spouses, but until she became such a
Whitewater target this week, most Americans were comfortable that her policy
wings had not been clipped.
Second, and perhaps less well appreciated, is that for most of their
marriage she has been the principal breadwinner, earning, as a legal star,
many times his governor's salary. She, like many modern American women, ran
their investments. None of his Arkansas enemies have ever claimed he knows
much about finance and the family.
Third, there is a well-established pattern to doing business in small
states. There will be a dominant local law firm, a leading local brokerage
and bank, and a powerful company or three, all of them accustomed to doing
business, sometimes sweetheart deals, with each other and with state
politicians. The Clintons covered most of these connections one way or
another and their state prospered, relatively, under their tutelage. On the
evidence so far presented - an important caveat given all the rumours of
smoking guns to come - Arkansas was no exception to the rule. And both
Clintons seem baffled that they should be thought to have done anything
wrong.
And they do not have the brass nerve of Orville Faubus, the Arkansas
governor of legend, who, when asked how he could afford a multi-million
dollar house when his salary had never exceeded Dollars 10,000 a year,
replied: 'I was parsimonious.' But that was Little Rock 25 years ago and
this is Washington today and the witch hunt is afoot.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Survey of Residential Property (8): Making a home where the
grass is greener - Gerald Cadogan visits a farm in the Welsh hills where two
friends work hard for self-sufficiency / The Good Life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Marmalade and Marmite are the handsomest pigs I have seen. A dappled black
and tan breed called Oxford Sandy and Black, they are a match for that
platonic ideal of a pig, Lord Emsworth's prized Empress of Blandings in P G
Wodehouse's novels. These pigs live 800ft up a Welsh mountain in
comfortable, clean-strawed styes on a self-sufficient small farm run by
Jamie Harris and her friend Eileen Proctor.
Family or household are better words than farm. The animals are happy. Jamie
loves them and talks to them. But she is not sentimental about them. In her
freezer she keeps joints of her well-raised kid, lamb and pork. She talks
about the smallholding in the matter-of-fact way of Mediterranean peasants.
But her affection for the animals would be rare in the Mediterranean. I
found them indoors when I visited on the coldest day of the year, when even
winter coats could not survive the cut of the wind. The goats in the byre
next to the pigs nuzzled up and wanted to be scratched under the chin like
cats, used to friendly humans.
The goats were striking breeds: two Swiss Tottenbergs, the third - Marina -
an Anglo-Nubian with a big 'Roman' nose who could have stepped out of an
ancient tomb painting on the banks of the Nile. She produces unusually rich,
creamy milk that Jamie turns into cheese.
Jamie is trying to find a separator to make butter and cream. These tools
have become scarce, even though not long ago most homes in Wales had one -
an indication of how the old skills of husbandry, which self-sufficiency
requires, are dying fast.
The 14-acre farm also has ducks and two donkeys - Shelley and Bruno - who
will soon be pulling a cart. 'It cuts using the car and pollution.' Six
Jacob's ewes, a tough breed suited for the Welsh hills, will be lambing
soon. Jamie spins the wool and knits gloves as uncommercial Christmas
presents - truly homespun, she says.
She has tried shearing, but 'it is hard not to cut the sheep as you dig
through 6in of fleece. They said you must keep going but I hesitated.' Now
she lets professionals do it.
The chickens are the trousery-legged Cochin breed, which Queen Victoria
introduced to Britain. They lay plenty of eggs, except in late autumn, when
their energy goes into moulting and growing new feathers. But the ducks are
pluckier, and lay all year round.
The hen houses, high off the ground, are made from old floorboards, as Jamie
believes in re-using everything. The greenhouse is made from the windows
local townspeople discarded when plastic windows came in. Twice a week,
Jamie goes to market for the old fruit and vegetables, which she boils up
for the pigs and goats.
Jamie (from Brighton) and Eileen (from South Shields) are both townies. They
were running the village post office at Cross-in-Hand in Sussex, when a
friend gave Jamie John Seymour's book on self-sufficiency. 'On down days I
found I was reading the chapter on how to keep ducks.'
They ran a wholefood restaurant in Crowborough, Sussex for a while.
Then, eight years ago, they bought Lan Farm. They paid the reserve price
after the farm failed to sell at auction. A gift of a dozen hens, who need
attention twice a day, tied them to the place immediately. After that, there
was no reason not to have other animals and learn to meet their different
demands.
As one leaves Pontypridd, and climbs up and up through the housing estates
of Graigwen the houses stop at a cattle grid. Fields begin. The farm is
close by, on top of the hill, with thrilling views and fresh air in
abundance.
'It feels so right to be here,' Jamie said. 'Putting the chickens to bed the
other night, with a glorious sunset, and thinking of the dinner, our own
potatoes and parsnips and goat, I felt quite emotional.'
The farmhouse was in rack and ruin, and had two collapsed barns when they
started. The first job was to pull the barns down. Neighbours offered help
and the names of craftsmen. 'It all just happened after that. Now we have
earned the respect of the community,' who walk past on Sunday afternoons and
can see how well run it is.
When I arrived, a tea of cheese scones, Welsh raisin cakes, soft cheese and
goat's milk fudge was waiting in the dry and spotless kitchen.
Have they found any anti-English feeling? 'This is not a second home. We
live and work here.' And anti-Englishness is less in south Wales than in mid
and north Wales, they thought.
But it is hard work. The animals are always there. And the walled garden is
demanding. The vegetables come type by type in seasonal floods, as they did
for everybody in the country in the pre-supermarket era. Now on the menu are
leeks, parsnips and potatoes.
The animals are their meat. They take them to a local butcher for slaughter.
He is only 20 minutes away and luckily still licensed.
'If the EU took his licence away, it would be a 60-minute journey. Think of
the poor animals, and the fuel and pollution.'
Are they self-sufficient? 'We are very close to it. The shopping bills are
going down.' But they cannot escape cash altogether, if only to pay the
council tax, utilities and the vet. So they take horses for summer grazing,
which helps towards repairing the gates and fences. They cannot take them in
winter as they have no stabling.
And they take guests for bed-and-breakfast - as people in Wales have been
encouraged to do after the collapse of the coal and steel industries. No
licence is needed for up to six guests, who can eat up the surplus produce.
'Bed-and-breakfast provides the cash, but it drives me potty,' Jamie said.
They have recently given up cooking dinner for the guests. After a long day
outside, it was too much. Jamie feels more and more strongly the pull of the
earth and the animals. Last summer she made an Indian-style tepee and slept
in it for three months.
They are considering selling the farm (inquiries 0443-403606). Jamie would
like to run holidays for underprivileged children, to whom she could hand on
the skills she has learned. The children would make cheese, tend the
animals, live in log cabins and learn the simple self-reliance of
self-sufficiency.
She would like to stay in Wales, a little nearer sea-level than the top of a
wind-blasted mountain, but has yet to find the place. Setting up a trust
would allow it to carry on after her time is up, she says.
What would they advise others? 'Go for it, sensibly though,' Jamie said.
'Expect a very hard life, all hours, seven days a week,' Eileen said.
Jamie continued: 'If you can't do it in the way we have, you can still make
your own bread and marmalade and cut out packaging. A lot of it is
knowledge. People think they don't know, but they can learn.'
As they have learned. You leave the farm wiser and happier. The goodness of
the earth and its produce permeates it. Look after it properly, and it will
look after you. Self-sufficiency means freedom because, whatever happens,
you have learned to cope.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Wild beast's real problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr PARVIZ DABIR-ALAI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The gist of Angus Foster's piece ('Taming the wild beast' - March 4) is
that Brazil has had unacceptably high inflation, the Urv may force it down
but not keep it there, and the finance minister might act as kingmaker to
himself or someone else. Brazil's real problems were not mentioned, giving
the impression that the pursuit of macro-economic stability was all that is
required.
While not an insignificant ingredient of an environment which may be
conducive to growth and prosperity, macro-economic stability alone is
insufficient. Tackling a record of poor governance and facing head on the
endemic poverty of many of its citizens are among a long list of
complementary factors required. Without these, resources devoted to
achieving macro-economic stability will just be wasted.

<TEXT>
Sir, In this age of diminished expectations, job security is a laughable
relic of a former life. We request, however, that the FT put serious
consideration to offering Mr Michael Thompson-Noel a columnist position
until the unfortunate event of his passing away.
As management students in the somewhat humourless US, we have come to rely
on his witty column every weekend as a source of unquestionable
entertainment value. His latest offering, 'Wimp of the species' (March 5),
was his best to date. As beleaguered males living in the politically
correct/feminazi world that is academia in Boston, we have finally found a
worthy and able spokesman for the endangered male species.
Hardly a day goes by that we do not thank our lucky stars that the FT and Mr
Thompson-Noel are available on this side of the pond.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NIGEL WILKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The weight of professional negligence claims against auditors has
finally proved too much for the Institute of Chartered Accountants
('Auditors seek to limit liability', March 3).
It certainly is unfair that in the event of company failure auditors face
the prospect of almost unlimited liability, while shareholders enjoy limited
liability and the directors appear to have hardly any liability at all.
However, in order to protect innocent creditors who may be the victims of
professional negligence, any reduction in the degree of the auditors'
liability would need to be offset by a commensurate increase in the
liabilities of the directors. This would best be achieved by the
introduction of compulsory professional indemnity insurance for all company
directors.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Legal limit of safety: The Heathrow attack has highlighted
UK security again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The scenario is familiar. A spectacular IRA mortar attack - this time at
London's Heathrow airport and audaciously restaged within 36 hours -
followed by political squabbles over allegedly lax security and a further,
inevitable, tightening of anti-terrorist measures.
The republican paramilitaries have proved yet again they retain not only the
capacity to strike on the British mainland, but the capability to penetrate
the extensive and expensively constructed armour of national security.
On past form - not always a reliable guide to what it will do next - the IRA
may now be content for a while to pursue its mainland offensive via the
telephone. Which head of security will, in the days ahead, run the risk of
dismissing an anonymous message about an unspecified attack?
Whatever lies ahead, each new assault brings a fresh appraisal of existing
security and, invariably, further unwelcome restrictions on the free
movement of people going about their everyday business.
In Northern Ireland, such measures have for years formed part of the
paraphernalia employed against terrorism. But now there are road blocks in
the City of London and video cameras strung along UK high streets to monitor
the innocent and the untoward. Police go to the brink of legality
selectively to stop and search.
To minimise the ever-present terrorist threat invokes accusations, already
being bandied about by politicians yesterday, of dangerous negligence; to
implement a draconian clamp-down hands the terrorists another form of
victory.
But, beyond the rhetoric, how much more can be usefully done in a world
where home-made weaponry mounted in a Nissan Micra can thwart the best
endeavours of 1,400 airport security staff, and threaten carnage in a
supposedly high-security zone?
The battle inevitably focuses primarily on trying to identify, locate and
arrest the IRA 'volunteers' who still plan murderous attacks while their
political masters talk of peace.
The IRA has changed its internal organisation in recent years in a way that
makes it more difficult to keep track of its operations and identify its
main players. The organisation has become more decentralised with
individual, active unit 'cells' operating autonomously, so that it is less
vulnerable to penetration by the security services.
There are, of course, exceptions. In Ulster itself, the recent rate of
success against paramilitaries has been good, while another mainland bombing
campaign was halted with last month's arrests and weapons seizure in
Accrington, Lancashire.
The security services have tried to match the increasing logistical
sophistication of the IRA with their own reorganisation. Two years ago, the
government agreed that MI5, the domestic intelligence service, should
replace the Metropolitan Police in leading intelligence-gathering on the
IRA. In addition MI5 has a specific role as policy adviser to the government
on anti-terrorism.
According to security sources, the move has gone some way towards
streamlining intelligence-gathering, which was previously subject to intense
inter-service rivalries. Tensions still persist, however, in relationships
between M15 and the Metropolitan Police Special Branch - still in charge of
operations - and between the various regional police forces which are
expected to contribute their resources to localised IRA threats.
Yesterday's call by Mr David Mellor, former Home Office minister, for a
national anti-terrorist force drawing police and security forces under one
roof is not a new idea and will continue to be resisted by those jealously
guarding their own patches.
More localised initiatives have had some success. The City, shattered twice
by IRA lorry bombs in 1992 and 1993, reacted positively, if controversially,
to its own bloody experiences. Though no one will tempt fate by declaring
victory, the decision effectively to shut down core areas of the square mile
and to step up high-profile policing has, so far, had the desired effect.
After the Baltic Exchange bombing in November 1992, the City police put more
officers, including some from the CID and fraud squad, on to the streets,
while the Home Office provided more personnel. City police introduced
24-hour patrols of armed officers, who employ powers under the Police and
Criminal Evidence Act to halt and question anyone they want.
In the wake of the Bishopsgate bomb in April 1993, the police worked with
the City corporation to implement the controversial road closure programme
intended to end the threat of vehicle-borne bombs. Cameras at eight entry
points record not only vehicles but passengers' faces.
But high security in one area carries the risk of terrorist activity being
transferred to another. The IRA takes a perverse pride not just in employing
new weaponry but in wrong-footing the authorities in its deadly game of cat
and mouse.
According to a City police source: 'We all recognise the danger that, in
putting up barriers, you simply shift attention to new targets. But that
doesn't mean that you can do nothing.'
Major John Wyatt, an anti-terrorist expert who has been advising City firms
on security in the aftermath of Bishopsgate, says permanent checkpoints are
not a solution: 'The IRA is always quick to exploit set patterns of
control.' The key to deterrence, he believes, lies in flexible controls and
improved intelligence.
The police, for good measure, would like wider powers of arrest and
detention. But everyone involved in the daily battle against terrorism will
privately admit one inalienable truth. Ultimately the answer will have to be
found by politicians and not by the forces of law and order.

guardian of free speech
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PHILIPPE LEGRAIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, With reference to your editorial 'Euro-babble' (March 3), I am
disappointed that a newspaper of your standing should stoop to telling the
European Union's culture and information commissioner to 'shut up'. Should a
guardian of free speech tell anyone to shut up, much less Mr Pinheiro whose
views - while different from your leader writer's - are respectable? It is
ironic that the same leader accuses Mr Pinheiro of 'an objectionable attempt
at censorship'.
On encouraging European audiovisual 'entertainment', you criticise Mr
Pinheiro's flawed proposals without suggesting alternatives. While
free-trade principles are important, films are not merely entertainment, but
also culture - and culture's value cannot be measured in purely economic
terms. If you insist on viewing it as a commodity like toothpaste, what
price do you assign to Shakespeare, national identity or freedom of
expression?

FT  12 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Statutory employer funding of Tecs
needed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER ASHBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your excellent leader comment on 'How Europe Can Compete' (March 9)
captures the essential differences between the 'Anglo-Saxon' liberal
approach towards labour market reform, and the more corporatist 'Rhine
model'. Those of us who favour the liberal approach, for its ability to
stimulate more jobs more quickly, must find ways of tackling one of its main
defects: less overall investment in skills.
It is now time for those who support Training and Enterprise Councils, and
the great steps forward that have been achieved, to recognise that Tecs have
not been radical enough. They have not brought on the new funding streams
necessary to underpin a big increase in skill levels.
The best way ahead would seem to lie through local systems of automatic
employer membership of Tecs, with all employers required to pay a
subscription to their Tec - apart from those who achieve the Investors In
People kitemark, who should be exempt.
Interestingly, this idea does not seem to provoke instant hostility among
employers in the way that national levies have done, over the years. After
all, if employers are meant to feel that they 'own' their local Tec, as
symbolised by the fact that two-thirds of the seats on boards are reserved
for the private sector, it is hardly unreasonable to expect them to pay
something towards the cost of ownership.
Statutory employer funding of Tecs could do much to help redress the UK's
chronic under-investment in skills. Coupled with strategies for encouraging
individuals to invest more in their own learning, it should now command a
wide measure of support - across the political spectrum.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Crime can make it nasty in Nice: Efforts by police and
politicians to combat Mafia infiltration along the south coast of France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the more ominous French words for organised crime is la pieuvre - the
octopus - and one of the more ominous fears in southern France is that its
tentacles are spreading.
Last month's gangland-style assassination of Mrs Yann Piat in the sunny
resort of Hyeres is the incident that has most shocked the French - because
she was a woman, because she was a UDF deputy in the National Assembly,
because she had the courage to campaign openly against corruption and
because she left behind a letter pointing the finger of suspicion at several
fellow-politicians if anything should befall her.
Mr Charles Pasqua, the interior minister, who has promised to get to the
bottom of the affair, sent a top Paris policeman and magistrate down to
Hyeres to head a massive inquiry. Two local men have been detained, but
dozens of others have been questioned, including some of those in Mrs Piat's
letter, such as Mr Maurice Arreckx, a senator and president of the Var
department's conseil general.
It is this possibility of home-grown political involvement in the Piat
killing that probably most shocks the French. But there is a wider
international context to her death, extending right along France's southern
seaboard. In Perpignan in the west, the local procureur (prosecutor) said
recently: 'I would dearly like to put my nose into the activities of a bank
and certain businesses based in a newly independent state bordering the
eastern Pyrenees', by which he meant Andorra. To the east, hard by the
Italian border, the city of Menton now routinely insists that Italians
wanting to buy a business or develop real estate produce a certificate from
the Italian authorities showing they are clean of the Mafia.
This week, top French and Italian investigators met to exchange information
on fighting organised crime. They gathered in Aix-en-Provence, whose
procureur general, Mr Claude Salavagione, warned publicly in January that
'Mafioso penetration is not just in drugs, but in all sectors'. This was
indeed the theme of a report last year by a National Assembly committee on
which Mrs Piat sat.
The report urged that France should act before the Mafia took deep root on
its mainland, as it has done in Corsica, where there have been 11
assassinations this year. But it spoke of 'worrying signs of a growing Mafia
presence in France', citing a few instances of its involvement in casinos in
the south-east, golf clubs in the Var and the Alpes of Haut Provence, and
more generally in real estate.
Perhaps its most disquieting revelation concerned the poor response of banks
in France's south-east to a 1992 decree requiring them to report suspicions
about drug-money passing through their vaults to a body within the finance
ministry in Paris, called Tracfin. 'Since February 1992, Tracfin has
received about 40 declarations of suspicions a month, which is few compared
with the thousand which Scotland Yard processes monthly,' the report said,
adding that it was astonished that 'the share of declarations of suspicions
coming from banks in the south-east was virtually nil'. Part of this is
because of the lack of any formal co-operation from Monaco.
Only one French city, however, pins its problems solely on the Italian
Mafia. This is Menton, where the mayor, Mr Jean-Claude Guibal, had the
effrontery in 1989 to refuse to let an Italian company manage the municipal
casino. 'We lived through hell,' says an aide to Mr Guibal. 'Our children
were threatened, we found crushed birds on our doorsteps, and a wheel came
unstuck when the mayor was driving his car.' After a tip-off from Paris in
1990 that the Mafia might try to take by force what it could not by
intimidation, the mayor ordered the casino surrounded by municipal garbage
trucks. Now the casino has a French manager and the city is calm, but the
mayor's office say it faces constant pressure from Mafia attempts to buy and
develop local real estate.
Further west along the Cote d'Azur, there are countervailing fiefdoms
keeping direct Mafia influence at bay. This was certainly true of Nice while
the Medecin family reigned in its hotel de ville. This long reign came to an
end in 1990 when Mr Jacques Medecin fled to Uruguay, where he is now
appealing against an extradition order to face tax and corruption charges
back home. But though a prison, a police station and a tax office were
mysteriously bombed in January 1993, the city remains relatively free of the
Mafia.
Certainly, Mr Jacques Peyrat believes so. He has no reason to do the Nice
political establishment any favours. He is running as the Front National
candidate in tomorrow's final round of voting in a Nice parliamentary
by-election, against the Gaullist mayor, Mr Jean-Paul Barety. Among the
charges levelled against the FN by its opponents, corruption does not
figure; by almost never gaining power, the FN (to which Mrs Piat once
belonged) has never sullied its hands in this way.
'I am certainly calling for a clean sweep in Nice,' Mr Peyrat says, noting
allegations by local Socialist councillors of impropriety by the mayor's
running mate, Mr Bruno Miraglia, in land dealings. Mr Miraglia denies any
wrongdoing. 'But this has nothing to do with the Mafia, who might have some
residences in Nice but have never tried to grab power here,' adds Mr Peyrat.
However, he sees real estate temptations for all concerned as Nice expands.
Growth has certainly brought graft to the Var department, now dubbed the
'Var West'. Once a rural backwater between Nice and Marseille, tourism has
given the department the second-fastest population increase in France.
Hyeres is much changed from the quiet resort described in Simenon's 1952
book Mon Ami, Maigret; it has had three murders and half a dozen bombings in
the past two years.
Mrs Piat had apparently intended to make opposition on environmental grounds
to full-scale development of the town's Giens peninsula a feature of her
campaign for the mairie next year. But the Var chamber of commerce, based in
Toulon, says her assassination is 'catastrophic' for the image of the
region, to which it has been trying to attract new industry to offset
shipbuilding's decline.
One theory is that Mrs Piat may have been killed in revenge for her alleged
involvement, perhaps with rival Marseille gangsters, in the assassination a
year ago in Italy of Mr Jean-Louis Fargette, a Toulon underworld figure.
Many Var politicians turned out for Mr Fargette's funeral, at which the
priest said: 'He forgot certain moral values, but I know he would never
touch drugs or prostitution out of respect for his mother.' Mr Fargette
figured in Mrs Piat's 1992 letter, as did Mr Arreckx and his departmental
vice-president, Mr Joseph Sercia, both of whom have been interrogated by
police.
UDF, the centre-right federation, is strong along the south coast. Mr
Arreckx and Mr Sercia belong to it - as does Mr Francois Leotard, the
defence minister, who has had to weather allegations of real estate
impropriety in his mayoralty of Frejus - and both men see in their police
interrogation a bid by Mr Pasqua's RPR Gaullists to discredit its coalition
partner and even the notion of decentralisation.
Certainly, the past 10 years of decentralisation have placed temptation in
the way of French regional and city bosses. It has boosted their budgets
(the Var's rose by 25 per cent over 1990-93) and powers to award contracts.
But reversing this is probably politically impossible and democratically
undesirable. Mr Francois d'Aubert, a UDF deputy and chief author of the 1993
Mafia report, believes regions or cities with political leaders who are
involved in corruption should be put under temporary direct rule from Paris.
Such an idea goes too far, says an aide of Mayor Guibal. But he suggests
that the interior ministry should provide cities like Menton with speedier
intelligence on doubtful applicants for city building permits.
Yet he concedes there are some requests that Paris cannot meet. 'We recently
received an application from an Italian company for a construction licence,
but the ministry has told us that the company has 300 partners and they
cannot possibly check all of these for Mafioso connections.
'Of course, the company will give us an anti-Mafia certificate, but that may
not prove much. So we'll just play for time, insist that their proposed
doors are 50cm too narrow or too wide, and eventually they will abandon the
project.'

finding a home - The advantages of professional home searchers / Relocation
agents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Relocation (or buying) agents appeared in the 1980s - after gazumping but
before negative equity. Part of their job is to prevent gazumping and
negotiate prices down. That automatically deters property inflation. Their
main function is to find and buy houses and flats.
At the end of the process, the service should have made clear to a client
all the pros and cons of the homes on their shortlist.
They charge a fee. But as they negotiate with the vendor's estate agent,
they can produce larger reductions on the selling price than the individual
buyer could achieve.
Add an immeasurable saving in hassle and family stress, and buying agents
can prove worthwhile.
If you want an expensive standard item, such as a flat in Knightsbridge,
central London, but find it daunting to work through the estate agents'
lists, then a buying agent will do the hard work, study the lists and
traipse around town to find a place to suit you and your way of life.
Buying agents create a level playing field in the game of winning a new
nest. With their help it can become an emotion-free commercial deal. And
when it is a matter of saying 'no', you have a third party to do it for you.
For example, flats and family houses are a routine request for London
company Property Vision.
If you are famous or rich, or both, an extra advantage is that the vendor
and his agent will not need to know your name until a deal is settled.
A buying agent starts by learning as much as possible about you and your
family and where you aspire to live.
A visit to your existing home is essential, unless you are overseas. The
agent sees how you live and what you want to improve on in a new home.
Expatriates should provide as much information as possible.
Then comes the search. Bedrock International starts in the office, sitting
you in front of a screen for a computerised armchair tour. You call up
pictures of possible properties and see if they appeal. Another plus is that
buying agents can often find properties that have not been put up for public
sale. Property Vision calls it 'the invisible market'.
Keeping an ear to the ground, the agents hear of houses that owners are
reluctant to admit to having to sell. Why? Perhaps because of two of the
property world's Three Ds, debt and divorce (the third is death).
Rupert Bradstock, of Property Vision, suggests that some owners, worried
about market conditions, did not want to risk their houses failing to sell
and thus going stale. His company bought more than Pounds 17m worth of
country houses last year, 53 per cent of them invisibly.
Last year's coup for Wilson &amp; Wilson was to buy Doddington Park, a stately
home in Gloucestershire. Charterhouse International, a young company in
Bath, secured a whole crescent house in Bath (1 Cavendish Crescent) with an
offer close to the asking price of Pounds 275,000, which it now manages for
its clients after supervising the restoration.
Another success was The Moot House, at Downton, in Wiltshire, built in 1650,
listed Grade I and on the market at Pounds 650,000.
Peter Lewis, Stacks' man in Dorset, had a red letter day when he bought an
old rectory from a vendor one morning and, in the evening, bought another
old rectory at auction for that morning's vendor.
How did he hear of the first house? 'Contacts, local knowledge, you know,'
he said.
The searches lead to a shortlist, on which the buying agent can give a full
and frank report on the properties.
That is useful as information in brochures becomes thinner, as Tad
Zurlinden, of the Association of Relocation Agents, points out. The agent
will also advise on schools, golf clubs, hunts, shops and all other local
matters, and will know a surveyor to call on quickly.
The buyer then visits the properties with the agent, possibly without the
vendor being present. All that remains is to make a choice and instruct the
agent to make an offer and negotiate.
It is no surprise that buying agents occasionally end up as friends of their
clients. After holding their hands (figuratively) and discovering what they
think really matters (which takes time to learn), they come to know them
well.
Fees are in two parts. A preliminary retainer pays for the agent's
out-of-pocket expenses, and shows that you are serious and will commit
yourself, acting fast if need be. If it has a limited term, an extension may
be negotiable. Wilson &amp; Wilson's retainer is Pounds 750, Stacks' Pounds 400
and Property Vision's Pounds 1,000. Add VAT to all sums.
Once the deal has been agreed, the retainer is usually set against the main
fee which is a percentage of the buying price, and often 1.5 or 2 per cent,
sometimes 2.5 per cent. The Property Service in London charges 1 per cent
with a minimum charge of Pounds 2,000. For a truly expensive property, you
may be able to elicit a discount.
County Homesearch has a variation. It charges the greater of 1 per cent of
the buying price or 15 per cent of the saving negotiated between the asking
price and the buying price.
'It is an incentive for us to find our clients the right property at the
right price,' the company says.
Property Vision will negotiate with the vendor's agent for a property the
client has found on his own for 1.5 per cent.
Buying agents must be prepared to advise a client not to proceed if the
property is in the wrong place or is too expensive. 'Some clients need the
sergeant major's approach,' Zurlinden says. 'It means they do not waste
their money.'
If a house on the invisible market costs too much, Property Vision advises
clients to wait until the owner puts it on the open market.
In the 1980s, when plenty of property was for sale, relocation agents helped
private buyers. In the recession they found themselves working for companies
that were moving and needed to rehouse their staff - the sort of task that
Hambros Countrywide Relocation specialises in - and were successful in
pushing down prices.
Last year, private buyers started to return. But it has been a thin market.
Too few houses have been offered publicly. This has been the best test of
the agents' power to search in the invisible market. ARA (031-558-3060) is a
professional body that issues a directory listing members' areas of
expertise. Groups covering much of the country that are members include
County Homesearch (0872-223349) and Stacks (0666-860523). ARA members
include disgruntled estate agents, converted to the other side, former
teachers, former army officers and surveyors. But many companies are not
members, including Charterhouse International in Bath (0225-482727) and
chains such as Black Horse and Nationwide.
London-based companies such as Bedrock International (071-351-2625), The
Property Service (071351-6552), Property Vision (071-602-8788) and Wilson &amp;
Wilson (071-727-1977) also see no need to join ARA, nor do the buying
departments of the major national estate agents - who will be glad to act
but may refrain from buying a house their company is selling, to avoid
conflict of interest.

FT  12 MAR 94 / No no no, Minister: Strains between the civil service and
its political bosses seem sharper then ever before. John Willman examines
why
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Whitehall's village, the bush telegraph is humming. Top mandarins are
said to be falling out with their ministers. Civil service morale is
described as being at an all-time low. Turf wars are breaking out between
rival UK government departments.
This is hardly surprising given the radical civil service reforms the
government is pushing through. But the strife extends to the politicians.
Parts of the government machine are reportedly paralysed by ministerial
indecision. Ministers are accused by some civil servants of spending more
time jostling for position in the race to replace Mr John Major than reading
the red boxes packed with papers needing their urgent attention.
There is certainly evidence of unhappiness among permanent secretaries, the
grade 1 civil servants in charge of departments. Two have retired early in
recent months, amid rumours of clashes with their political masters.
In November, Sir Geoffrey Holland announced his departure from the
Department for Education after barely 10 months in the post. At 55 and after
a glittering career as head of, first, the Manpower Services Commission and,
then, the Department of Employment, he was leaving Whitehall to become
vice-chancellor of Exeter university.
'He jumped with a golden umbrella and a big smile on his face,' a spokesman
for the Department for Education suggested. Others were less sanguine: it
was widely reported that he had fallen out with Mr John Patten, the
education secretary. 'Either he goes or I do,' he is rumoured to have told
colleagues.
It is improbable that such a polished performer said anything of the sort.
But there was a problem over rapport, with Sir Geoffrey said to be
frustrated at the inability of Mr Patten to think big. Too much time was
spent fire-fighting, dealing with problems over issues such as school
testing that many in the department felt were self-induced.
This week, Sir Clive Whitmore, top man at the Home Office, confirmed he was
also off before retirement age. His imminent move to an unspecified
'well-paid' job in the private sector was linked with reports of friction in
the department between civil servants and Mr Michael Howard, the home
secretary.
Unlike Sir Geoffrey, Sir Clive circulated a memo to his officials denying a
rift with his secretary of state. But there is no doubting the unhappiness
among many senior Home Office mandarins over the home secretary's robust
approach to law and order. They see the rapidly increasing prison population
as a policy designed to strengthen Mr Howard's claims in a future Tory
leadership battle. That he has not been willing to listen to their
objections - or study evidence suggesting the policy will be an expensive
failure - adds insult to injury.
'I can't understand why Clive hasn't exploded in public instead of simply
retiring,' says one a seasoned Whitehall watcher.
Morale is also said to be low among civil servants at the environment
department. Their secretary of state, Mr John Gummer, recently made a
much-publicised conversion to the Roman Catholic church after the Church of
England decided to ordain women.
Mr Gummer was already in his officials' bad books after last year's public
expenditure battle when he conceded cuts in his budget of more than Pounds
1bn. He is now condemned by senior mandarins for what they regard as an
unforgivable sin: his alleged reluctance to read briefs. Departmental
business has ground to a halt, they say, as he wrestles with his conscience
over matters spiritual.
Elsewhere in Whitehall, there is a struggle for turf over the new job
seeker's allowance for the unemployed, to be introduced in 1996. Merging
unemployment benefit and income support for the jobless will cost thousands
of civil service jobs. The Department of Social Security believes its
Benefits Agency should pay the new allowance. The employment department says
job seekers are the province of the Employment Service which runs programmes
to help the unemployed back into work.
A similar battle can be expected over proposals to merge the Inland Revenue
and Customs and Excise, revealed in yesterday's FT. These two Treasury
departments are unlikely to surrender their independence without a fight.
And the interminable tug of war continues over responsibility for training.
The Departments of Trade and Industry, Education and Employment are all
unwilling to give up their share of this market.
Even the Foreign Office, under the unflappable Mr Douglas Hurd, is not
immune from fear and loathing. An unprecedented meeting of London-based
staff was summoned in January to hear the foreign secretary try to soothe
fears on the future of the diplomatic service.
'There is an awful lot of turbulence around,' according to a civil servant
in charge of an executive agency. 'Ministers haven't got their act together.
'The thrashing around gets back to senior colleagues who are becoming very
concerned. It all creates great uncertainty.'
That uncertainty is amplified by the Scott inquiry into the arms-for-Iraq
scandal, which has sent a frisson through Whitehall. The public
interrogation of senior civil servants by Lord Justice Scott and Ms Presiley
Baxendale, his steely counsel, has set what many see as a dangerous
precedent.
'It came as a great shock to learn that ministers' private memos could be
produced in court,' says one grade 3 civil servant in charge of a policy
area in a large department. 'It's much harder to get decisions out of
ministers now. They are no longer willing to commit their thoughts to paper,
and delay everything for meetings.'
Whoever is responsible for current indecision and delays, mandarins have
long griped about the shortcomings of their political masters in their Pall
Mall clubs.
Professor Peter Hennessy, the Whitehall historian, quotes the example of Mr
George Turner, a permanent secretary at the wartime Ministry of Supply, who
was prone to describe the department's ministers as 'our two parliamentary
liabilities downstairs'. Neither of the ministers in question could be
called political slouches: Mr Harold Macmillan went on to become prime
minister, while Mr Duncan Sandys had a distinguished cabinet career and was
colonial secretary.
That the standard moans have become louder is seen by many as a consequence
of the reforms imposed on the civil service since Mrs Thatcher came to power
in 1979. Civil servants have had to digest manpower cuts, privatisations,
the creation of more than 80 agencies to deliver services, the Citizen's
Charter and pay freezes.
The most hated reform has been market-testing, the programme under which
civil servants must compete for their own jobs against bidders from the
private sector.
'The civil service has traditionally been regarded as an unrisky
profession,' says Ms Kate Jenkins, a former high-flying civil servant, now a
consultant on public service reform. 'Now it has been involuntarily exposed
to risk in a way that civil servants would not have expected when they
joined the service.'
The standard civil service response under such an onslaught is the sort of
backchat and griping that is now the dominant signal on the Whitehall bush
telegraph. Another is foot-dragging, which has been clearly visible in the
slow progress over the first 18 months of market-testing.
Figures this week from the Cabinet Office show that several departments have
yet to finish half the market-testing programme that should have been
completed by the end of last September. They include Social Security, Trade
and Industry, Education and the Lord Chancellor's department.
Embarrassingly, the Treasury, guardian of the nation's purse, is also among
the laggards. And the Office of Public Service and Science, the Cabinet
Office division in charge of Whitehall reform, has barely done better, with
just over half its programme finished.
The final straw for many mandarins has been the recent report from the
Cabinet Office efficiency unit on top appointments in the civil service.
'It talks about opening up the top jobs to outsiders, advertising all posts
and introducing contracts of service,' says one aggrieved civil servant.
'It's all very unsettling.'
These sentiments might easily be put down to fears that promotion would be
blocked by such measures. Yet this civil servant is of an age when he has no
further career ambitions. His concern is over the effect on those further
down the ladder who will see the best jobs awarded to people brought in from
the private sector.
Ministers' tendency to denigrate the civil service exacerbates these fears,
says a former civil servant who is now a public sector consultant with a
large accountancy firm.
'Ministers have this ethos that there's nothing very good about the civil
service,' he says. 'They neglect its strengths - the collegiate approach in
which no decision is taken without consulting a wide range of people and
thinking through long-term consequences.'
'Politicians no longer see civil servants as professional advisers,' says
another ex-civil servant. 'Increasingly they treat them as gophers.'
Prof Hennessy sees this mishandling of the civil service as a reflection of
the decline of the British political class. 'Civil servants always like
working for the big figures like Willie (Lord Whitelaw) and Dennis (Lord
Healey). They're even quite fond of current grandees such as Douglas Hurd
and Michael Heseltine. It's the meagre placemen they don't like, the
small-minded ideologues who have risen without trace.'
Civil servants have also been wrong-footed by the unexpected radicalism of
Mr Major on civil service reform, according to Mr Graham Mather, president
of the European Policy Forum, the independent think-tank.
'They had expected things to calm down after Mrs Thatcher went, and they
haven't'
Since Mr Major shows no signs of abating his radicalism in this policy area,
the hard times look set to continue. Expect more grumbling on the Whitehall
grapevine, and further premature departures from the ranks of Britain's top
mandarins.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Leading Article: George fires a warning shot
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England is flexing its muscles. The annual rate of UK economic
growth could rise to as much as 3 per cent over the next 18 months to two
years and needs no 'artificial' stimulus, predicted the governor, Mr Eddie
George, in the US on Thursday. Earlier in the week, his deputy, Mr Rupert
Pennant-Rea said that it was 'a delusion' to think that the UK had defeated
inflation.
Arriving in Detroit for the jobs summit of the Group of Seven leading
industrial countries next Monday, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will be
cheered by the Bank's views on the strength of the recovery back home. But
he will also find it more difficult to make a case for cutting interest
rates, should he wish to do so.
Evidence from the first of this month's batch of economic statistics would
seem to bear out the Bank's optimism. Figures published last week showed
that manufacturing output increased by 1.1 per cent in January, a much
larger rise than was expected, while December's drop was revised to just 0.2
per cent. Housing starts rose by an annual rate of 16 per cent in the three
months to January, although from a low base. Government estimates of net
lending to consumers in January showed a sharp drop from December 1993. But
figures from the Finance and Leasing Association, which are taken from a
wider base, disclosed a 37 per cent year-on-year rise in gross lending
between January 1993 and January 1994.
The sharp rise in bond yields witnessed in recent weeks suggests that
investors in bonds share the optimism over growth. Yields on 10-year gilts
now stand a little under a percentage point higher than at the beginning of
the year. The rise in the yield on index-linked gilts implies that about
half of this increase is due to higher real interest rates. The remainder is
due to a rise in inflationary expectations. Both presumably reflect greater
confidence about the prospects for economic growth, partly worldwide, but
partly also in the UK.
Strong demand
Yesterday's trade figures confirm the picture of strong demand. The surge in
imports in December, and upward revisions to the trade deficit for the whole
of last year, also rekindle fears that the UK economy will suck in imports
and run into balance of payments problems, as it starts growing reasonably
rapidly. The rise in manufacturing output gives some reason to be optimistic
on this score, however, since manufactures constitute such a large
proportion of the country's traded goods.
The output figures also show that production of investment goods rose by
nearly 4 per cent in January, while that of consumer goods fell slightly.
There may be evidence here of a shift towards investment-led growth,
essential if a rapid recovery is to prove sustainable.
Nevertheless, what is happening to consumption will be of more immediate
interest to Mr Clarke as he contemplates the effect the imminent tax rises
may have on the economy. Consumer expenditure grew at an annual rate of 3.2
per cent in the final quarter of last year, which confirms that personal
consumption, much the biggest component of demand, is the driving force
behind the recovery. But the measures announced by Mr Clarke and his
predecessor Mr Lamont in last year's two budgets represent a net fiscal
adjustment of Pounds 12.8bn. The tax bill of a married man on average
earnings will be Pounds 12.50 a month heavier after April.
Reduced savings
Taxpayers' disposable incomes are going to be hit hard, as the Labour party
has delighted in pointing out. If the consumer-led recovery is not going to
grind to a halt, consumers will have to reduce their rate of savings. In
fact, they have already begun to do so. The savings rate fell from a peak of
13 per cent in the middle of 1992, to 10.6 per cent in the third quarter of
1993. But if real consumer expenditure is to continue growing at 2.5 per
cent a year at a time of stagnant real disposable incomes, the savings rate
will need to fall to 6 per cent by the end of 1995.
The consensus is growing among commentators, including the chancellor's own
panel of independent forecasters, that the recovery should survive the
increased tax burden. Needless to say, there are also dissenting voices who
refuse to accept that the savings rate is set to decline so sharply.
Unemployment needs to continue its decline if the precautionary element in
savings is to fall. House prices, which rose 3.8 per cent in February, will
also have to recover still further if consumers are to feel confident about
their wealth.
Despite these doubts, it would be a brave chancellor who ignored the
outspoken comments of the governor of the Bank of England. It seems
increasingly likely that policymakers will wait until the effects of next
month's tax rises become evident before deciding whether to make further
changes in interest rates. Moreover, the next move in interest rates may not
be downwards.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Man in the News: Sacrificial spirit of devotion - Wei
Jingsheng
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wei Jingsheng, China's most prominent dissident, has been cooling his heels
this week in a small inn in the bleak port city of Tianjin about an hour's
drive south-east of Beijing.
It is a moot point whether Wei is under arrest or under surveillance, but
his movements have been severely curtailed while Mr Warren Christopher, the
US secretary of state, is in Beijing this weekend.
Thus, in feudal tradition a naysayer has been banished from the capital to
spare China's rulers a troublesome presence. Chinese history is replete with
such examples. Wei's treatment is a reminder that even in the country's
modernisation phase, official behaviour sometimes owes more to the past than
to the present.
The 44-year-old Wei was reported by his secretary to be in good spirits. For
someone who emerged last year from more than 14 years in jail, including a
stint in a penal colony in remote and harsh Qinghai province, his temporary
'exile' in Tianjin must seem like a mild inconvenience.
Not that Wei, the former Red Guard and People's Liberation Army soldier is
likely to be much fazed whatever his circumstances. Suggestions that he had
suffered a mental breakdown while in jail proved unfounded. 'My will was
strengthened and so was my determination to increase people's awareness of
democracy,' he told the Financial Times recently.
Wei may not have the international stature of a Sakharov, the Soviet nuclear
scientist condemned to internal exile during the Brezhnev years, but in the
Chinese context he is a central figure as the unofficial 'leader' of a tiny,
fragmented dissident community.
Chinese official nervousness of Wei's ability to use an occasion such as Mr
Christopher's visit to amplify his call for political freedom both at home
and abroad is perhaps not surprising.
Fresh in Chinese memory is the embarrassing row that marred President George
Bush's visit to Beijing in 1989 - months before the Tiananmen square
massacre - after moves by the authorities to prevent the dissident Professor
Fang Lizhi from attending a presidential banquet.
That episode, perhaps more than any other, rendered Prof Fang a dissident
hero in his own country, and gave him exceptional prominence
internationally. He was exiled to the US in 1990 and has become a remote
figure to his countrymen.
However, lao Wei (old Wei) as he is known in the dissident community, has
remained close to his roots, and since his release from jail last September
has continued to press his views among his fellow dissidents and in
conversations with journalists and diplomats.
Western officials say that it would be a mistake to exaggerate Wei's
political importance in a country where the few dissenting voices are barely
heard above a whisper; but equally he could become a 'rallying point' in a
time of crisis.
Wei's dissident colleagues make no attempt to hide their admiration for his
commitment and sacrifice. Liu Xiaobo, one of the leaders, or so-called
'black hands', behind the pro-democracy protests of 1989, says: 'He is one
of the few democracy fighters to devote himself totally to the cause. If you
don't have such a spirit of devotion you can't survive very long in such a
totalitarian system.'
Wei cannot be faulted for lack of staying power. He first came to notice in
1978 during the brief Beijing political spring as perhaps the most literate
of the pro-democracy activists who made their voices heard in big-character
posters pasted on the grimy wall of a Beijing bus station on the city's main
boulevard.
His most enduring testament and one that angered Deng Xiaoping was a poster
entitled 'The Fifth Modernisation', which appeared on 'Democracy Wall' on
December 5 1978. This was a cheeky play on the 'four modernisations'
campaign embraced by the Communist party a month or so previously, which had
pointedly excluded any reference to political liberalisation.
'What is true democracy?' Wei had asked rhetorically. 'It means the right of
people to choose their own representatives who will work according to their
will and in their interests. Only this can be called democracy.'
These views were a deep affront to Communist rulers emerging from the years
of chaos of the Cultural Revolution. Their misgivings were compounded when
Wei dared to suggest in contributions to the underground magazine,
Exploration, that the Communist party itself had failed, and, worse, that
Deng himself had a flawed appreciation of China's needs.
This was too much for Mr Deng, who has never shown much squeamishness about
dealing with dissent. In the spring of 1979, Wei was sentenced to 15 years
in jail for leaking military secrets to a foreign journalist and for
counter-revolutionary activities.
The penalties seemed excessive, even by the standards of the time, and Wei's
incarceration proved a blight on China's reputation throughout the 1980s.
His release last September, six months before his jail term expired, on the
eve of the vote awarding the 2000 Olympics to Sydney, was a crude attempt to
boost China's chances of hosting the games.
Whatever Wei's feelings about being used as a pawn in the Olympics chess
game, he showed quickly that he had lost none of his appetite for
controversy. He dared the Communist party to meet the challenge of change.
'China is changing, so how can the Communist party remain unchanged?' he
asked reporters. 'The question is whether that change can keep up with the
pace of change in society. If it can't, then I'm afraid what has happened in
the Soviet Union and eastern Europe will happen here. People will rise up
and topple the government and then there will be turmoil.
'I hope party members will be wise enough to keep pace with the wishes of
the people and thus achieve a smooth transition.'
With Mr Deng slipping away, and with Wei in reasonably good health in spite
of his long ordeal, it is just possible that China's leading dissident may
have the last word.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Hurd warns of big gains by Lib Dems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, warned Conservatives yesterday that
the Liberal Democrats could gain significantly in the forthcoming European
and local elections.
His warning that the Liberal Democrats would benefit from public cynicism
about politics was part of a strong Tory offensive against the party, which
was gathering in Cardiff last night for a spring policy conference.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, meanwhile accused the
Conservatives of distorting his party's long-standing commitment to European
federalism - Liberal Democrat support for a federal Europe is expected to be
confirmed by the conference tomorrow.
Delegates will vote on a resolution calling for 'a united Europe which is
democratic, decentralised and diverse: a federal Europe' and which says the
European Union should confine its activities to 'a limited range of big
issues where European institutions are clearly effective'.
This is in line with recent efforts by party leaders to play down the
federal issue in the light of public hostility to Europe. The resolution
envisages transferring powers over large areas of the economy, the
environment and employment to Brussels, however.
Mr Ashdown said the Conservative party had perverted the meaning of the word
federalism by pretending that it implied a more centralised Europe, with
greater powers exercised from Brussels.
Mr Charles Kennedy, the Liberal Democrat president, said people were 'far
less sceptical about Europe than most Tories believe'.
Mr Hurd told Conservatives in his Oxfordshire constituency of Witney that a
'general suspicion of politics and politicians' had undermined governing
parties in Canada, Italy, Japan, Germany and the US.
'A party of protest without hope of government sometimes fares better in
this situation than the official opposition,' Mr Hurd said. 'Hence the
success in by-elections of the Liberal Democrats, who confuse and contradict
themselves at every turn.'
Mr Hurd said the Tories would overcome this problem by maintaining the
economic recovery and making the public see that it was under way. He warned
that Conservatives would have to struggle against an 'increasingly hostile
press which is remarkably sensitive at any criticism of itself'.
The ministerial offensive against the Liberal Democrats was joined by Mr
Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, and Mr William Waldegrave, public
service minister, who attacked the party's defence and economic policies.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Liberal Democrat spring policy conference opens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 1,300 delegates at the Liberal Democrat spring policy conference will
debate a range of initiatives designed to set the stage for the
parliamentary, local and European elections in the next three months, Kevin
Brown writes.
Debates on issues such as the inner cities, homelessness, social policy and
prostitution are intended to sharpen the party's urban image for a battle
with the Tories for inner-city and European seats.
Party leaders acknowledge that the test will be the Eastleigh by-election
caused by the death of Mr Stephen Milligan, the Conservative MP. The party
believes it can win the seat, which would guarantee a high profile in the
European elections in June.
But Liberal Democrat strategists believe that the government may hold the
by-election as early as mid-April in an effort to catch the opposition
parties off guard.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Quicker land searches urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A call for councils to handle standard land-search inquiries from
prospective homebuyers within 10 working days was made yesterday by Mr John
Gummer, environment secretary.
Mr Gummer, speaking to the Council of Mortgage Lenders as the Department of
the Environment published a consultation paper on plans to make this
mandatory, urged councils to bring in the standard voluntarily before
legislation was introduced.
The proposals include making councils refund all or part of the fee if they
fail to deal with the inquiry within the time limit.
Mr Gummer said the government's aim was to 'ensure that delays with searches
do not emerge again when the housing market picks up'.
Replies to the consultation paper are wanted by early May, but there is no
certainty that the necessary legislation would be included even in the
parliamentary session of 1994-95.
Mr Andrew Longhurst, chairman of the CML, reiterated the organisation's
opposition to more cuts in mortgage interest tax relief. He said further
reductions could lead to more repossessions.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Privacy law delayed by doubts over right to sue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government plans to introduce privacy legislation face further delay because
of doubts about how best to create a right to sue for breach of privacy.
It could be summer before a long-expected white paper is published, nearly a
year after it was first promised.
The white paper, which was due to be published later this month, has been
delayed because of the concern of Mr John Major and ministers about the
section creating a new tort - or civil wrong - of breach of privacy.
The main issue causing difficulty is how to make the right to sue available
to everyone. Failure to do so could call into question the wisdom of
introducing the tort while creating a bonanza for lawyers protecting the
privacy of the rich and famous.
A meeting involving all the government departments involved, ranging from
National Heritage and the Lord Chancellor's Department to the Home Office
and Downing Street, will be called to resolve the remaining difficulty.
The National Heritage Department said yesterday the white paper was unlikely
to be published until after Easter.
The government is determined to push ahead with introducing criminal
offences covering electronic eavesdropping or using long-range lenses to
take pictures on private property. The offences, outlined in the Calcutt
report, would apply to everyone and not just journalists.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Phone watchdog levies record fine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A company raising money for children's charities has been fined Pounds
90,000 by Icstis, the telecoms industry regulator, for running a
'misleading' premium-rate telephone competition.
The fine is the largest in the watchdog's eight-year history.
The Children's Support Foundation, a Birmingham-based company trading under
the name Lucky Numbers, advertised holiday prizes, including weeks in
Florida and Tenerife.
Readers were invited to phone an 0891 premium-rate number - paying 48p a
minute at peak rate and 36p a minute off-peak - to find out details. In fact
the prizes were highly conditional, in some cases involving winners buying
flights and/or accommodation.
Icstis received a flood of complaints about the competition. It said
yesterday that the fine took account of the call revenue made by the service
as well as the seriousness of the case. Baroness Dean, Icstis chairman, said
it was 'a clear-cut and serious case of the public being misled'. The fine
was intended to defer other companies seeking to 'hoodwink the public'.
Children's Support Foundation, which described itself as a non-profit-making
company raising money for registered children's charities, reacted angrily.
Ms Stephanie Weightman, a director, said competitors were not obliged to
phone the premium-rate number but could have participated by post. 'There
was no intention to mislead,' she said. 'We believe we are being made an
example of.'
Icstis is better known for its campaign against premium-rate telephone sex
lines, which British Telecom agreed to curb last year. However, it is
increasingly concerned at abuse of premium-rate lines for fraudulent
competitions and advertisements.
The Children's Support Foundation was using premium-rate numbers supplied by
Telephone International Media, one of 300 providers of premium-rate numbers.
Mr David Redmile, managing director of TIM, said he had checked the bona
fides of CSF before agreeing to issue numbers. He said it appeared to be
raising funds for charity and had offered previous phone competitions
without complaints.
Although Icstis is not a statutory body, it is recognised by BT and other
telecoms operators. Suppliers of premium-rate services are obliged to abide
by its code of practice.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Smith contemptuous of 'punch-drunk' Tories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, yesterday delivered a contemptuous attack
on the Conservative government, saying it had run out of imagination and
energy and was kept going only by its desire to stay in office.
He told the annual conference of the Labour party in Scotland at Dundee that
the government was like 'a punch-drunk boxer, kept going only by his desire
to stay on his feet'.
It was almost impossible to find a leading Tory who was not preparing for a
leadership contest, he said. 'Whether the prime minister likes it or not,
every speech by leading cabinet ministers is now scrutinised for signs of
whether or not that particular minister is trying to improve his chances of
succeeding Mr Major.'
He said government priorities were dictated by the odds one could get on the
leadership prospects of Mr Kenneth Clarke, Mr Michael Heseltine and 'the
fading Michael Howard.'
In a reference to last week's clear-out of much of the board of Celtic
football club in Glasgow, he said: 'While ministers scurry around trying to
prepare for a boardroom coup, don't they understand that the country doesn't
care who the managing director is? The country doesn't want a boardroom
coup. From everywhere comes a stronger and more familiar cry - sack the
board.'
Mr Smith attacked the government's bill for reforming local government in
Scotland, which is in its committee stage in the Commons.
He said the bill had 'shambolic proposals' which were drawn up not by an
independent government commission but by 'Tory ministers sitting down with a
map and pencil and drawing up the boundaries' to make sure there was as much
Tory blue as possible on the political map.
He said the establishment of a Scottish parliament was unfinished business
for him, because he had been the minister responsible for devolution in the
last Labour government.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Savings bond attracts Pounds 480m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sales of the most recent National Savings product - the guaranteed income
bond for pensioners - drew in Pounds 480m last month, accounting for the
bulk of National Savings' net contribution to government funding last month
of Pounds 775m.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said he was pleased with the 'excellent'
result. 'I am delighted that so many pensioners have taken this opportunity
to protect the income from their savings.'
The bond, which pays an annual fixed rate of 7 per cent gross for five
years, went on sale on January 21 and has been bought by nearly 90,000
people aged at least 65.
Gross sales of National Savings products in February totalled Pounds 1.46bn.
Accrued interest was Pounds 158m and repayments amounted to Pounds 839m.
Premium Bonds, with sales of Pounds 201m, had their most successful month,
partly because those bought in February are eligible for the first Pounds 1m
prize draw in April. The total amount invested in National Savings at the
end of February was Pounds 47.7bn.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Call sign: India Romeo Alpha: Why London's main airport can
never be terrorist-proof
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While the authorities at London's Heathrow Airport, together with the police
and the army, yesterday discussed ways of increasing security in the wake of
a second IRA mortar attack, there was acceptance that there were limits to
how much could be done to protect the public in such a large,
frequently-used and exposed area.
BAA, which owns Heathrow, said the police presence at the airport would be
stepped up. But it added: 'There is always going to be a balance between
allowing the airport to run and offering the highest possible security.'
Heathrow covers 2,958 acres. Its perimeter road is 9.5 miles long. More than
42m passengers pass through the airport every year and it has a workforce of
55,000 people. There are more than 20 hotels in the immediate vicinity, not
to mention Underground stations and many acres of car parks.
One civil aviation expert, speaking last night, said: 'To ensure 24-hour
protection against a mortar being mounted and fired somewhere within this
area within minutes is virtually impossible and impractical.'
In Northern Ireland, Belfast's City airport has managed to ensure a high
level of security, making it one of the few areas of the city relatively
well-protected from terrorist attack.
Tight security measures - involving permanent road blocks manned by armed
police backed by armed patrols - have been operational at the airport for
years. Its small size, however, makes such security measures more practical
than they would be at Heathrow - which is one of the busiest airports in the
world. Belfast's City airport, in comparison, handles only 842,000
passengers a year and employs just 250 staff.
Major John Wyatt, an anti-terrorist expert, said yesterday that areas at
Heathrow vulnerable to mortar attack could be identified using computer
calculations of potential trajectories. How-ever, he conceded that even this
system, used by some defence companies, was no guarantee against terrorist
attack.
Heathrow says that it has increased security substantially in recent years.
Spending on security is Pounds 54.4m a year, and involves a total of 1,400
staff.
In 1990 new legislation gave the transport secretary powers to detain
aircraft and close airports and freight operations if a serious security
lapse occurred.
In Spain, another European Union country facing a terrorist campaign, only
armed police have responsibility for security in airports. In Heathrow,
since BAA was privatised, security companies have been put in charge within
the airport, although armed police offer a back-up deterrent force.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Survey of Residential Property (6): Prepare for the costs of
moving home - You may be able to afford the mortgage, but have you allowed
for all the additional bills of buying and selling? Gerald Cadogan makes a
list / Moving house
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What does moving to a new home cost? Hassle and family stress for a start,
and a grim coming to terms with the detritus of one's past when sorting out
old belongings. And the costs can make a sizeable charge at the bottom of
the overall bill. The more you investigate beforehand, the better.
Selling
I asked the local offices of Lane Fox and Savills, two national estate
agents at the top end of the market, and Nationwide what they charge. All
are represented in the north Oxfordshire town of Banbury. Houses for sale on
their patch range from old village cottages and 19th century workmen's
terrace houses, through recent lower and middle income estates to old
rectories, manor houses and a few stately homes. In assessing fees, bear in
mind that they may be different at other branches or in London.
Lane Fox and Savills sit side by side in Banbury, but their prices differ. I
asked them the cost of selling two houses, one in the Pounds 450,000-Pounds
550,000 range, and the other a Pounds 60,000 property, which is roughly the
average house price in the Department of the Environment and Halifax
indices.
Lane Fox suggested around 2 per cent of the selling price plus the necessary
VAT as a fee for the large house. To market it effectively, this house would
need a colour brochure and national advertising, which we trust would mean
the Weekend FT as well as Country Life (where a half-page colour
advertisement would cost Pounds 1,500). The vendor pays these expenses
totalling around Pounds 2,000-Pounds 3,500 (plus VAT). The fee for the
Pounds 60,000 house would be 2 per cent, to include a simpler brochure and
local advertising.
Savills suggested much the same: 2-2.5 per cent as an inclusive fee for the
cheaper house, and 2 per cent plus the expenses, which might amount to
Pounds 2,000-Pounds 4,000 (plus VAT), for the larger house.
Nationwide would ask for 2 per cent plus VAT for sole agency, as a set fee
to include local advertising and photography; no sale, no fee.
Account-holders with Nationwide might obtain a 10 per cent reduction, so
ask.
When selling:
Ask at least two agents who know your type of home to quote.
Do not necessarily choose the firm with the cheapest fee or which suggests
the highest asking price. It may have over-valued in order to gain your
instructions, in which case buyers will not come to view. A
reasonably-priced house can sell at close to the asking price, or above when
there is competition. Look hard at the firms which sell your type of home.
If you think fees are high, they are much higher on the Continent and in the
US.
Surveys
Still in Banbury, I asked chartered surveyor Paul Lester, of Lesters, what
he would charge for the two houses. He offers three types of survey. A
home-buyer's report suits a modern property and most buyers. It uses a Royal
Institution of Chartered Surveyors printed form which has a paragraph on
every aspect of the building as the basis of a thorough inspection. The
charge would be Pounds 175-Pounds 250 (plus VAT). An intermediate survey for
Pounds 300-Pounds 350 would look harder at the principal defects, such as
settlement, dry rot and damp.
A full structural survey could cost anything from Pounds 350 to Pounds
1,000, depending on the size of the property and the difficulty of access to
roof spaces and other hidden parts. Most surveys of this type are in the
Pounds 400-Pounds 450 range. Lester is surprised how many people do not take
surveys. If they do, 'they are not grateful when you have found something
wrong'. They do not want any threat to stop their new dream coming true.
But on a full survey it is rare that the buyer cannot save Pounds 1,000
(provided his offer is subject to contract and survey). Local surveyors with
local knowledge are vital.
Conveyancing
For the Pounds 60,000 house, Will Arber of solicitors Bower &amp; Bailey, a firm
with branches in Oxfordshire and along the M4 corridor between Reading and
Bristol, suggested a likely bill of Pounds 250-Pounds 325 plus VAT to
include minor expenses such as copying and stamps.
The main fee depends on how much work is involved, which is unpredictable.
This figure is about the same as in 1980 - because of the competition among
solicitors to service the smaller number of property transactions in the
recession years. It does not include disbursements for local authority and
other searches, which have risen and vary from one authority to another -
but the authorities are now quicker at producing the information.
'It is the mortgage offer that holds things up. That is usually the last
piece of the jigsaw,' said Arber.
There is also the land registration fee, which rises in bands, and stamp
duty starting above Pounds 60,000 at 1 per cent of the total price (not of
the excess over Pounds 60,000).
For the Pounds 500,000 house stamp duty would be Pounds 5,000, and the land
registration fee Pounds 1,800. A likely solicitor's bill would be Pounds
750-Pounds 1500 plus VAT, Arber said, because it is usually more work and
there is an element of insurance in the bill. If something goes wrong, the
solicitor is liable for much more.
I then asked one of the solicitors in Bedford Row, London what he would
charge. He pointed out that the cheap house could make as much work as the
expensive one, and suggested as a rough guide half the agent's fee - thus
around 1 per cent plus VAT.
Both solicitors stressed how important it was to find a good lawyer who
checked everything. 'Unqualified people are doing more of the work now,'
said Amber, 'and they make mistakes.' That can lead to trouble in years
ahead. If you get a low estimate for the solicitor's bill, ask who in the
office will actually be doing the work. The local solicitors' advantage is
that they know the area and have the contacts.
Mortgages
The Weekend FT's Finance and the Family pages regularly report on mortgages
and the ever-changing menu of packages that building societies, banks and
other lenders offer. They want business and it is wise to shop around.
Nationwide for instance has no application fee at present and the basic
valuation is free. For fixed rates mortgages there is a reservation fee,
ranging from Pounds 95 for a two-year term to Pounds 300 for a 10-year term.
There is no further fee for variable rate mortgages.
All borrowers who take out their mortgages receive Pounds 250 'cashback'
about a month after completion - which virtually pays the maximum Pounds 300
fee.
Cheltenham and Gloucester has removed application and valuation fees for
home-buyers taking out a new mortgage or a further advance. The society
estimates that this saves about Pounds 160 for a Pounds 55,000 property and
Pounds 450 for Pounds 750,000 house. But there is still a reservation fee
for fixed rate mortgages.
Moving
On the day of moving comes a bill that is difficult to predict, as each
collection of household belongings is different. You can hire a van and do
it yourself with the help of friends, but if you call in the professionals,
they will want to see what furniture you have and where you live. Are you in
a third floor flat? How many antiques, pianos, grandfather clocks and
chandeliers do you have? How much will you pack yourself? For journeys of
less than 100 miles, labour is a large part of the cost.
Banbury Removals suggested a possible range of Pounds 250-Pounds 350 plus
VAT for moving the contents of a three-bedroom semi 80 miles (and perhaps
Pounds 155-Pounds 200 for 10-15 miles). An old rectory might come to Pounds
800-Pounds 900. Bishop's Move suggested Pounds 250-Pounds 450 for the
smaller house (and Pounds 200-Pounds 400 for 10-15 miles), and Pounds 400-
Pounds 800 for the larger. These estimates can only be rough.
Ask for several quotations, and light a candle for a sunny day.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Detained asylum seekers protest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 180 asylum seekers started an indefinite hunger-strike yesterday
at Campsfield detention centre, near Oxford, in protest at their detention
without trial or charge for periods of up to a year.
The centre, run by the Group 4 security company, opened in November to take
the overflow of detainees from Harmondsworth, near Heathrow Airport.
The centre has drawn protests from more than 100 Oxford dons, including 24
professors and 11 heads of colleges, who signed an open letter to Mr John
Major, the prime minister.
A hunger-strike by a group of Algerian detainees ended last weekend when
they were taken to a private psychiatric hospital in York and then released.
This time, all but a handful of the centre's 200 inmates have joined the
strike.
Mr Charles Wardle, immigration minister, said in a radio interview last week
that 'only a tiny proportion' of those seeking asylum were detained 'if they
don't comply with restrictions'.
Two detainees interviewed at Campsfield yesterday said they had been
detained on arrival in the country and had not been offered an option of
complying with restrictions.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Sharp fall in exports to EU blamed for wider trade gap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp fall in exports to the European Union led to the surprise widening
of the UK trade gap in December, official figures issued yesterday show.
The visible, or merchandise, deficit widened to Pounds 1.57bn compared with
November's Pounds 1.28bn. This is the largest monthly deficit for almost
four years - except for December 1992. The November figure turned out to be
worse than provisionally estimated, revised up from a provisional Pounds
1bn.
Most of the deterioration occurred in Europe, where the UK does more than
half its trading. The seasonally adjusted figures from the Central
Statistical Office showed that in December the visible trade deficit with
the EU was Pounds 903m, compared with Pounds 543m in November.
Some decline in exports to continental Europe was to be expected, given the
weakness of the area's economies, but most analysts were surprised by the
3.6 per cent fall in volume terms, compared with November. The trade
position with countries outside the EU improved.
The latest figures again raised doubts about the new system for gathering
trade statistics. The CSO is carrying out an inquiry into the system -
Intrastat - following fears that it underestimates imports.
Uncertainty about the figures was not enough to assuage fears that trends
point to a marked widening of the UK trade gap.
Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities, said: 'Export and
import trends are now adverse.' He added that in the last quarter of last
year export volumes excluding oil and erratic items - ships, aircraft,
precious stones and silver - fell 3 per cent, while import volumes rose 3.5
per cent.
Mr Briscoe added: 'This is good news for the recovery, but the inability to
satisfy the demand domestically is a real worry.'
The overall underlying deficit - excluding oil and erratics - deteriorated
to Pounds 1.8bn in December from Pounds 1.6bn in November.
The figures suggest that manufacturers are continuing to protect their
export margins. In the fourth quarter they raised export prices 2 per cent
compared with the previous quarter, in spite of a 3 per cent fall in volumes
in the same period. They raised their prices 11 per cent compared with the
same quarter a year ago, when volumes fell 2.5 per cent.
Trade with France fared particularly badly in the fourth quarter of last
year. The deficit was Pounds 775m compared with Pounds 155m in the third
quarter. The deficit with Germany was about unchanged at about Pounds 1bn.

Mr Tony O'Reilly's Independent Newspapers of Ireland promised yesterday that
it would provide funding for Newspaper Publishing, owners of The Independent
and Independent on Sunday, if a takeover bid by a consortium which includes
Mirror Group Newspapers was referred to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
The move - with the group saying that it would provide finance in line with
its 29.9 per cent stake in Newspaper Publishing - is designed to remove any
possible danger of insolvency at the newspaper.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Labour attacks watchdog changes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alistair Darling, Labour's City spokesman, has seized on the views of
some Tory backbenchers to intensify pressure on the government over
regulation in the financial services sector. A Commons committee is already
examining the issue.
Seven Conservative MPs have tabled a Commons motion which suggests that the
Personal Investment Authority, the new watchdog for retail financial
services, will lower regulatory standards.
In a letter to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, Mr Darling says the
government cannot 'continue to ignore the mounting concern and scepticism
that surrounds the present system of regulation'.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Capital issues reach record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies announced new capital-raising issues worth Pounds 6.86bn in
February, the highest monthly total since records began in 1986, Philip
Coggan writes.
The figures, published by the Bank of England yesterday, show that companies
are still taking advantage of what, in historic terms, are low bond yields
and high share prices.
Of the total, Pounds 4.92bn was in sterling and of this Pounds 2.1bn was in
the form of ordinary shares.
Actual gross issues in February totalled Pounds 4.84bn. After redemptions of
Pounds 2.01bn, the net figure was Pounds 2.83bn.
New issues have been high since the start of 1993, and the evidence is that
companies are replacing bank loans, accumulated during the recession, with
bond and share issues.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Maxwell administrators agree to pensions talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Price Waterhouse, the firm acting as administrators to Maxwell Communication
Corporation, has agreed to hold negotiations with lawyers acting for the
Maxwell pensioners.
The pensioners are seeking the return of up to Pounds 235m allegedly
misappropriated from their company pension schemes.
The move follows a closed High Court judgment on February 25 when Mr Justice
Vinelott strengthened an earlier decision not to authorise a distribution of
MCC assets to creditors until pensioners' claims had been protected.
Any settlement arising from the talks would significantly affect the
proposed distribution of assets - currently exceeding Pounds 680m - raised
by the sale of MCC businesses by the administrators.
The four high street clearing banks would be among those unsecured creditors
of MCC that would receive considerably reduced dividend payments from the
administrators if the talks succeed.
The negotiations will be aimed at short-circuiting the complex legal
proceedings now before the Appeal Court in which the liquidators of
Bishopsgate Investment Management, the former managers of the Maxwell
company pension schemes, are seeking a proprietary claim to the first Pounds
235m of the Pounds 680m raised by the administrators.
In December Mr Justice Vinelott said: 'It would, I think, shock the
conscience of any informed member of the public if it were to transpire that
monies which could have been claimed as belonging to pension funds had been
distributed to unsecured creditors, however tenuous the claim by BIM and the
pension trustees might have appeared to be at the time of the distribution.'
If successful, the BIM court action would substantially reduce the money
available to meet the claims of other unsecured creditors, currently
totalling over Pounds 2bn.
It was Mr Justice Vinelott's rejection of BIM's arguments which prompted it
to take the issue to the Court of Appeal earlier this week. Three appeal
court judges have reserved their judgment.
However, with a final appeal to the House of Lords possible, authorisation
of the distribution of the MCC assets is likely to be delayed until May at
the earliest. It is this delay which is believed to have brought the MCC
administrators to the negotiating table with lawyers acting for the
pensioners.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Customs defends handling of Matrix case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Customs &amp; Excise prosecutors continued with the Matrix Churchill trial
although they knew of the government's confidential shift of policy to
promote the export to Iraq of machinery capable of making arms, the Scott
inquiry was told yesterday.
The prosecution of three businessmen was brought on the basis that the tools
produced by the company were specially designed for military use and that
Whitehall officials were unaware of this, Mr Cedric Andrew, an assistant
chief Customs investigator, told Lord Justice Scott.
In a statement defending the Customs' decision to prosecute, Mr Andrew said
that Department of Trade and Industry officials suspected some machine tools
exported to Iraq might be used for military purposes.
This did not, however, amount to an adequate defence for the three
businessmen accused, but later acquitted, of evading export restrictions.
Mr Andrew said it was clear from the early stages of the investigation that
the government's policy on exports to Iraq was not 'black and white'. There
was 'quite an evident will' in some Whitehall circles after the Iran/Iraq
ceasefire to modify the policy.
He added: 'The investigation and prosecution conceded that there was plenty
of government suspicion, perhaps bordering upon knowledge, that some, if not
many, machine tools were going to Iraq for military use.'
Since this was conceded by Customs, it was not felt to be an area worth
'prolonged investigation'. Had the alleged breached of export regulations
occurred in relation to 'dual-use' machinery no prosecutions would therefore
have taken place, said Mr Andrew.
Instead, the Customs prosecution focused on the premise that the Matrix
Churchill exports were designed specially for military use, Mr Andrew said.
'Had the exporters openly declared, when their sales contracts revealed it,
that their machine tools were clearly intended for military use, then the
evidence is, from all those involved in the licensing decision, that an
export licence would have been refused,' he added. 'Such a declaration . . .
would have removed any argument or uncertainty about military end-use.'
Mr Andrew said that nobody in government, including Mr Alan Clark, the
former trade minister, had ever argued that, had the full facts been known,
the exporting of specially designed military-use goods would have been
approved.
There was no evidence, however, that anyone in the DTI knew the Matrix
Churchill machinery was certain to be used, for military purposes.
Mr Andrew said: 'Customs evidence contends that the defendants had not told
the government the truth that the goods for which an export licence was
sought were specially designed.'

FT  12 MAR 94 / Leaving white cliffs for golden sands: The travel trade
needs fewer Britons holidaying abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Ms Adele Biss, chairman of the British Tourist Authority, climbed into
a London taxi recently, she berated the driver because his cab was blue.
'Black taxis, red buses - these are icons,' Ms Biss says. 'Changing them is
like changing the colour of the white cliffs of Dover.'
By promoting red London buses and black cabs abroad, the BTA helped UK
tourism to a record year in 1993. The number of overseas visitors was up 4
per cent to 19.3m. Spending by foreign visitors rose 15 per cent to Pounds
9.1bn. This year visits to Britain by people from overseas are expected to
exceed 20m for the first time.
Unfortunately for the balance of payments, companies which take UK
holidaymakers abroad had an even better 1993. The number of foreign holidays
taken by UK residents rose 8 per cent to 23.5m. The proportion of British
holidaymakers who took holidays of four nights or more in the UK fell to its
lowest level ever - 58 per cent, compared with 70 per cent in 1983.
The travel account deficit of the balance of payments - which includes
business and educational trips as well as holidays - increased to Pounds
3.7bn last year from Pounds 3.4bn in 1992. With the package-tour industry
forecasting that overseas holidays this summer could be as much as 20 per
cent higher than last year, the deficit is likely to increase further.
Little of the blame can be laid at the door of those who bring visitors to
the UK. For a country without reliable sunshine or a substantial ski
industry, the UK has achieved considerable success.
In 1992 the UK was the world's fifth biggest earner of international tourist
revenues after the US, France, Spain, and Italy. In the same year overseas
visitor earnings accounted for 7.3 per cent of the UK's invisible exports
and 3.7 per cent of all exports. If fares paid to UK airlines are included,
the figures rise to 9.2 per cent and 4.6 per cent.
Visitors to the UK are sufficiently impressed to come back. In 1992, 71 per
cent of visitors had been to the UK before. Visitors said heritage,
countryside, arts and entertainment were the main attractions.
Ms Biss says the key to boosting the tourist industry is persuading more UK
residents to take their holidays at home. The industry, she says, cannot
survive on growth from foreign visitors alone.
The difficulty for UK tourism is that it is more fragmented than the
overseas package holiday industry. Three large companies dominate the
overseas holiday business: Thomson, Airtours and Owners Abroad. Each has its
own charter airline. Thomson and Airtours own the UK's two biggest travel
agency chains.
By contrast, a report last year by Coopers and Lybrand, the management
consultants, estimated that the domestic tourist market was made up of
220,000 businesses represented by more than 30 trade organisations. The
largest organisation responsible for domestic tourist marketing is the
English Tourist Board, whose government grant is set to fall from Pounds
13.9m in 1993-94 to Pounds 10m by 1995-96.
Ms Rosemary Astles, Thomson's marketing director, says her company's annual
marketing budget is 'significantly more' than the board's grant.
While foreign visitors come to the UK for history and culture, Britons go
abroad for the sunshine their own country cannot provide. A survey last year
by Lunn Poly found that only 8 per cent of package travellers had any
curiosity about the culture of the countries they planned to visit.
Ms Biss believes more could be done to market UK holidays to the British.
She says she is talking to the travel agency chains about giving greater
priority to domestic holidays.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Abta wins holiday insurance test case
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A schoolgirl and her teacher yesterday lost a High Court test action against
the Association of British Travel Agents over a holiday insurance premium
that was not repaid when an Abta member became insolvent.
The value of the claim, on behalf of 54 other pupils at Nower Hill School,
Pinner, north London, was just Pounds 10, but a further 25,000 cases rested
on the outcome.
The teacher had booked the holiday with Abta member Adventure Express Travel
Services. The company became insolvent before the party was due to leave,
and Abta refunded the money already paid except for the insurance.
The teacher claimed that the deduction by Abta, which denied liability, was
a breach of what it had promoted as 'the Abta promise' and that the
association was therefore in breach of contract.
Mr Justice Mitchell ruled that the Abta notice, which explains to customers
the form of protection Abta extends to them, did not contain words of
contractual promise and therefore no contract existed between the teacher
and Abta.

FT  12 MAR 94 / TGWU launches probe over funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's second largest union yesterday launched an investigation into
alleged misuse of union funds by officials on Merseyside and Manchester.
The investigation is at present internal but it is understood that Mr Bill
Morris, TGWU general secretary, will call in the police if necessary.
Three officials from the north-west region of the TGWU general union are to
be questioned by Mr Albert Blyghton, the union's legal secretary, over a
number of issues including alleged intimidation of members during recent
elections for the union's general council. It is understood that the
allegations are not against the elected council members.
Nobody has been suspended and Mr Bob Owens, the regional secretary, is not
under investigation. Mr Morris said: 'The leadership . . . is acting to
defend the integrity of the union.'
Among the allegations is that a grant of Pounds 53,000 from the European
Union, given for training shop stewards, was transferred into a non-union
account and has gone missing.
The union had also been paying money to members involved in a dispute at a
cleaning company on Merseyside but has been unable to check details of how
many members are involved.
The investigation will also look at payments to TGWU members involved in a
three-year dispute at a Merseyside company. More than Pounds 300,000 in
strike pay has already been paid without a firm record of how many were
involved in the strike.
Another allegation is that an advertising company paid the union to carry
advertisements on taxis driven by TGWU members, but the contract was never
fulfilled.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Survey of Residential Property (5): Cautious buyers are
hungry for more choice - What's on offer for eager homehunters / The state
of the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recovery in the housing market is as variable as in the rest of the
economy. Prime London prices - and rents - are up, and that is spilling over
into the home counties. The number of repossessions is coming down and
negative equity is disappearing. Agents have plenty of potential buyers on
their books but not enough houses to sell to them. When buyers compete, a
property sells for more than its guide price.
Buyers are still being circumspect. If a property price is set too high,
they will not even bother to look. Prices are still being cut on houses
which are in danger of becoming 'old chestnuts', or are so already.
Stockton House, in Wiltshire, is down from Pounds 1m to Pounds 700,000, and
Kingsmead House near Tetbury, Gloucestershire, from Pounds 1.2m to Pounds
950,000 (both with Savills). The old rectory at Chudleigh near Exeter,
Devon, priced at Pounds 285,000 in 1991, is on offer through Constables at
Pounds 199,950, but offers of Pounds 175,000 will be considered.
Set a sensible guide price for a good property, and people flock to view.
Even the houses that have stuck are moving, which is a good omen, as it
underpins the market for fresh properties.
The potential buyers are 'mainly people with a pent-up desire to move,' says
James Laing, of agents Strutt &amp; Parker. They are tired of living in
short-term, rented accommodation or waiting for their present house to lift
in value. However, in Guildford, Surrey, Tommy de Mallet Morgan, of Savills,
meets young City workers, with bonus, girlfriend and Porsche, who have the
cash for a six-bedroom house in the Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 1m range. 'It
is an equity-driven market. They want the best and have a sharp instinct for
what is new on the market, perhaps because their work is trading.'
Vendors have been reluctant because they want to secure their new place
first, or are waiting for price rises to bring their properties back to the
amount they paid a few years ago. But there are signs of more instructions,
notably in the north, north-west and Yorkshire.
Houses are selling quickly and only genuine cash buyers have a chance of
getting what they want. Buyers who agree terms have also stopped reneging on
completing their deals, notes Tim Blenkin, of Blenkin &amp; Co, Knight Frank &amp;
Rutley's associate in York.
With so little to buy, purchasers will consider a long-term let. Strutt &amp;
Parker's office in Newbury, Berkshire, reported a huge response when it
brought to market Buscot Manor - a National Trust property dating from 1691
near Faringdon in Oxfordshire - for rental on an assured shorthold tenancy
of an initial 10 years.
The terms were not cheap. The rent was to be around Pounds 1,300 a month,
and the tenant had to agree to spend at least Pounds 15,000 on the house in
the first six months of tenancy, to include refurbishing the kitchen. A
shortlist evolved of five prospective tenants who were happy with the terms;
that has been reduced to two between whom the trust is deciding.
James Laing expects a rise in prices in 1994, but not of the 20 per cent or
so predicted in December by Yolande Barnes, of Savills Residential Research.
Buyers remain cautious even though conditions for buying have not been so
good for many years, in terms of house prices, household incomes and low
interest rates, with the chance of locking into them through long-term fixed
rate mortgages.
It is hard to predict the impact of the April tax increases or of the
government's endless woes. And as more sellers gain the confidence to
instruct agents, the supply-demand imbalance will lessen and the pace of
price rises slow down.
London has led the recovery, thanks first to the overseas buyers who have
been at work since autumn 1992, and to the recipients of City bonuses.
Hamptons prime residential property index shows a 9.9 per cent rise in 1993,
the first increase in capital values for four years, and Cluttons London
Residential sees the average discount between asking price and selling price
now narrowed to 2.5 per cent.
Prices in central London have continued moving up by 6 to 7 per cent so far
this year, but they may drop back 2 to 3 per cent when more stock becomes
available. Winkworth reports properties coming under offer at the asking
price within a day. Foreign buyers are still very much in the market.
Outside London the rise has been strongest in areas such as Surrey, which
were first to fall in the slump. The London euphoria is starting to ripple
through the home counties - at least at the top end, where Ian Stewart, of
Savills, has sold six properties in the Pounds 1m-Pounds 3m range recently.
These include West Croft Park at Chobham in Surrey, and Harewood Park at
Ascot, which both went for near their asking prices of Pounds 3m and Pounds
2m respectively.
On the next rung down, the optimism has yet to become euphoria, but de
Mallet Morgan has underbidders regretting they did not offer more. Why?
Because they cannot find anything else. 'A good, free-standing five-bedroom
house, I could sell just like that.' Eventually, the rises will spread to
all parts of the country, he says.
With instructions starting to warm up, the building societies are the chief
problem, says Blenkin. Scarred by their losses on houses they repossessed,
they are now extra cautious about lending on older properties, which is
nerve-wracking for buyers and sellers.
In Norfolk, Bidwells' old chestnuts are starting to go after 'hanging
around' for 1 1/2 to two years. But Norfolk is not for commuters. Nor is
Shropshire, where too few properties are for sale, says Eddie Jenkins, of
John German, in Shrewsbury. The market has perked up since the end of the
year, but there is no surge. Bank managers are telling potential sellers,
'hold firm', he says.
In the west country, the number of buyers moving from the home counties fell
off after 1989, but they are now starting to return. Stags finds that
two-thirds of its buyers are from south of a line from the Cotswolds to the
Wash. More buyers now look for a home with some income, such as cash from
holiday rentals. The company sold Ellicombe Manor in Somerset, for more than
Pounds 300,000, with four letting units in gardens of two acres.
Agents across the country would agree. For Jackson-Stops and Staff, 1993 saw
a 20 to 30 per cent increase in deals but little price movement, says Andrew
Froude, chairman. This year he expects more of the same - more activity but
no dramatic price increases. 'They may average 5 per cent over the year,' he
says. More optimistic forecasts may be counterproductive. Vendors hanging on
may lead to price increases but, while buyers are re-establishing their
confidence, they will be cautious.
No-one wants a return to the 1980s, least of all farmers, who saw their
earnings increase 60 per cent last year, thanks to better EU payments from
the devaluation of the pound, and lower interest on their overdrafts. Laing
believes that farms look a good market for the next five or six years,
covering 1996, when the present Common Agricultural Policy has to be renewed
in line with Gatt.
Now that insurance companies and other institutions have been disinvesting,
it is increasingly a market governed by farmers - which is healthy. As for
big estates, Froude says: 'They always sell at a premium and always find a
buyer, because very few come up in a year. They are nice for journalists to
write about, but they are a special case.'
The last word goes to Ian Stewart. 'It is the healthiest market for quite
some time.'

FT  12 MAR 94 / Councils lose challenge to reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A High Court judge yesterday rejected applications by three councils for a
judicial review of the Local Government Commission's proposals for council
reorganisation in north-east England.
Humberside and North Yorkshire county councils and Ryedale District Council
are all opposing the commission's recommendations for five unitary
authorities north of the Humber in place of the current two-tier system.
They had argued to the High Court that the commission had failed to consult
properly or to consider the possibility of maintaining the status quo.
Mr Justice Laws rejected their applications, ruling that the commission had
acted properly. He said the applications by the three authorities were an
attempt to raise a challenge on points of law about the commission's
recommendations when in fact their complaint was about the merits of its
recommendations.
'It is elementary that complaints of this kind are not generally the
business of the judicial review court,' he said.
It was more appropriate for representations to be made to Mr John Gummer,
the environment secretary, than to the courts, he suggested.
The judge's ruling does not clear the way for the government to reach an
immediate decision on the commission's recommendations. The authorities
intend to apply to the Court of Appeal for a hearing to mount another
challenge. No decision could be made until after any such hearing.

FT  12 MAR 94 / In 40 years' time, black Africa might reach the level of
wealth it had 20 years ago: IMF reforms are paying off, but the continent is
way behind the rest of the world, says the World Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unless sub-Saharan Africa's 'poor' economic policies improve, it will be 40
years before the region returns to its per capita income of the mid-1970s,
warns a World Bank report on the region published tomorrow.
Even Ghana, rated the best of Africa's reforming countries which has
achieved real growth of about 5 per cent a year, is still among the world's
poorest countries: 'At this growth rate, the average Ghanaian will not cross
the poverty line for another 50 years,' says the report.
The report is the most sombre in a series that go back to the early stages
of Africa's economic crisis. Past studies have combined tough appraisals
with upbeat expectations of reform. The latest study warns that success will
not come easy, but cautions against 'undue pessimism', pointing to the fact
that Asian countries which had almost no growth between 1930 and 1960 now
enjoy 'stunning' growth.
Structural adjustment is essential but not sufficient if sub-Saharan Africa
is to achieve sustained growth, says the World Bank in a 280-page appraisal
of economic reform. But while it stresses the need for 'good governance' in
Africa, the report does not elaborate on either the measures required, or
assess its impact on economic performance in the years under review.
Of the 29 countries studied in the report, the six with the most improvement
in macroeconomic policies between 1981-86 and 1987-91 enjoyed the strongest
resurgence in economic performance, with an average annual growth of 2 per
cent in GDP.
By contrast, says the report, countries that did not improve their policies
saw their GDP decline by 2 per cent a year, in all likelihood increasing the
number of poor.
Although the outcomes are 'encouraging' they are not as positive as they
might be. Current growth rates among the best African performers are still
too low to reduce poverty much in the next two or three decades.
'So far the rebounds have merely bought countries back to their historical
trend of low growth, and it is not yet clear whether they are shifting onto
a higher growth path.
'Without further substantial increases in agricultural, investment, export
and GDP growth, sub-Saharan Africa will continue to lag behind other
developing nations.'
The report examines the relationship between economic policy and growth in
sub Saharan Africa, by comparing the performances of 29 countries during two
periods: 1981-86, when the region was in economic crisis but few countries
were implementing economic reforms, and in 1987-91 when most African
governments had adopted World Bank supported structural adjustment
programmes.
The six leading reformers reduced budget deficits, curbed inflation,
introduced competitive exchange rates, tariff reforms and agricultural
incentives.
Countries that have liberalised their pricing and marketing of agriculture
have seen a resurgence in domestic production of both food and export crops,
says the Bank.
The study 'also shows that it is not always true that devaluation
necessarily results in higher rates of inflation provided there were
complementing policies of wage, fiscal and monetary restraint . . . and
indeed reaped the benefits in terms of competitiveness on the world market.'
Export volumes increased significantly, despite declining terms of trade, if
the exchange rate, agricultural pricing and marketing liberalisation polies
were implemented, says the report.
Comparing Africa and other developing regions, the Bank says: 'It is
worrisome that even the best performers in Africa do not come close to
matching the good macroeconomic policies typified by Chile, Malaysia, Mexico
and Thailand, where inflation is close to 10 per cent a year, budget
balances range from deficits of 2 per cent of GDP to small surpluses and
currencies are fully convertible, at least for current account
transactions.'
African governments are criticised for slow progress in privatisation. 'The
value of privatisations in Nigeria between 1988 and 1992,' says the Bank,
'was less than 1 per cent of that in Argentina, Malaysia or Mexico, even
after adjusting for Nigeria's smaller GDP.'
Africa's financial sector is still 'heavily burdened' by public sector
demands for credits, says the Bank. Central governments alone (excluding
public enterprises) absorb more than 30 per cent of domestic credit.
'There is substantially more room for improving policies,' said Mr Kim
Jaycox, the Bank vice president for Africa, at a press conference in
Washington to launch the study.
'Macroeconomic policies deteriorated in a third of the countries, and no
country has achieved a first rate macroeconomic policy stance - low
inflation, very low budget deficit and a competitive exchange rate,' he
said.
Africa performs particularly poorly in comparison with other developing
countries.
In 1965, Indonesia's GDP per capita was lower than Nigeria's. Today, it is
three times higher. Thailand's income per head in 1965 was lower than
Ghana's; now it is one of the fastest growing economies in the world.
The report notes Africa's declining share of developing-country exports of
food and agricultural products. It halved between 1970 and 1990 (from 17 to
8 per cent) with Asia increasing its market share. The high rate of
population growth - more than 3 per cent a year - strains the limited
resources available.
Adjustment programmes can establish a framework for sound investment and
efficient resource use, but are no substitute for long-term development
efforts to build the capabilities of Africa's people by putting adequate
resources into education and strengthening weak management capacity.
'Emphasis on universal primary education is the key to achieving rapid
growth in the best performing Asian economies,' says the bank.
Other central policy measures which are vital include the need to accelerate
divestiture programmes and develop financial sectors. Reducing Africa's
external debt burden and maintaining aid flows 'is essential', says the Bank
'but debt relief and aid only make sense if sound economic reform programmes
are in place.

THE VIEW FROM THE WORLD BANK OVER 14 YEARS
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
1994
Current growth rates among the best African performers are still too low
to reduce poverty much in the next two decades. So far, the rebounds
have merely brought countries back to their historical trend of low
growth, and it is not yet clear whether they are shifting onto a
higher-growth path. Without further substantial increases in
agricultural, investment, export and GDP growth, Sub-Saharan Africa will
continue to lag behind other developing regions.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Arafat wants peace talks, says Kozyrev
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, said in Tunis last night after
a meeting with Mr Yassir Arafat that the PLO leader had expressed his
commitment to resuming peace talks with Israel.
Earlier in the day he had arrived in Israel for talks with the prime
minister and foreign minister
at the beginning of what Russian officials described as an independent and
'dramatic' shuttle mission between Israel and PLO headquarters Tunis.
At the same time, President Boris Yeltsin named Mr Viktor Posuvalyuk, head
of the foreign ministry's Middle East department, as his special envoy on
the Middle East crisis. Presidential envoys enjoy wide authority and close
ties with the president.
Mr Kozyrev said in Tel Aviv, Russia wanted to save the peace process and was
supporting PLO demands for an international presence in the occupied
territories and further measures by Israel to protect Palestinian lives in
the wake of the Hebron massacre two weeks ago. Mr Kozyrev made no comment on
Moscow's announced support for the reconvening of a multilateral Middle East
peace conference in Madrid.
The Russian initiative marks Moscow's decision to pursue an independent
Middle East policy for the first time since the Madrid peace conference in
1991 and has been less than welcomed by Israel.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, has let it be known that Russian
intervention is not welcome because it exposes the division in policy
between Russia and the US, the two co-sponsors, which in turn strengthens
the PLO's push for more Israeli concessions. Mr Rabin also rejected any
attempt to reconvene a Middle East peace conference in Madrid.
Meanwhile, Mr Warren Christopher, US Secretary of State, appeared to be
increasing pressure on both sides to return to talks. Israeli officials said
Washington was now supporting the PLO demand for the evacuation from Hebron
of 415 Jewish settlers living in the heart of the Israeli occupied West Bank
town of 110,000 Arabs. Mr Rabin has so far ruled out evacuating the settlers
on political grounds. The settlers have vowed a nation-wide campaign of
civil disobedience to resist any effort to force them to leave.
Mr Christopher also sent a secret message to Mr Arafat yesterday. The US has
threatened to veto a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning
the Hebron murders unless Mr Arafat sets a date for returning to talks with
Israel. A vote on the UN resolution, a key PLO demand before returning to
negotiations, has been delayed until tomorrow at the request of the US. PLO
officials said the US is using its delaying powers and the threat of a veto
to put pressure on Palestinians. The US is also apparently backing Israel
which is unhappy about the inclusion of the word Jerusalem as part of the
Israeli-occupied territories in the language of the resolution.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Spain's underlying inflation, which excludes the more volatile price
movements of fresh foods and energy, fell by 0.2 per cent in February to
give a year-on year rise of 4.9 per cent, the lowest rate since April 1988.
Higher fresh food prices kept headline inflation unchanged to give a
year-on-year rate of 5 per cent. The underlying rate was helped by a fall
from 6.4 per cent to 5.9 per cent in the traditionally high-inflation
services component of the index. The extent of this fall indicated more
moderate unit labour costs as well as slack domestic demand. Analysts
believe inflation will fall rapidly in the coming months. Madrid securities
firm FG forecasts a headline annual rate of 4.3 per cent by June and 3.8 per
cent by the end of the year.
Germany's M3 money supply grew by a revised annual rate of 21.2 per cent in
January. The Bundesbank's target growth range for M3 in 1994 is 4-6 per
cent.

China's budget deficit is forecast to reach Yuan67bn(Pounds 5.2bn) this
year, an increase over last year's actual deficit using new accounting
procedures. Mr Liu Zhongli, China's finance minister, presented a bleak
picture of China's finances to the National People's Congress, warning that
difficulties in implementing a new tax system and widespread tax evasion
made it virtually impossible to predict revenues. China's 1994 state budget
anticipates revenues of Yuan476bn and expenditures of Yuan543bn. This year's
deficit will be funded largely by issuing Yuan115bn of domestic bonds. Mr
Liu indicated that this year's deficit would be about 15 per cent higher
than last year's.

Carmen Lawrence (left), former premier of Western Australia, is set to

by-election today, senior ministers have indicated. Campaigning in Fremantle
on Ms Lawrence's behalf, Senator Graham Richardson, one of the most
influential figures in the Labor Party, said he believed Ms Lawrence 'will
win (a cabinet position) and she will win very comfortably'. He declined to
say which jobs she might be offered. Despite the Labor Party's lack of
popularity in Western Australia, Ms Lawrence is a well-liked local figure
and is not expected to have any difficulty holding the Fremantle seat. Ms
Lawrence's sensible style and popular appeal have caused speculation that
she could be a future Labor prime minister.

War-torn Cambodia was pledged more than Dollars 700m in additional aid
yesterday after an appeal by King Norodom Sihanouk for a 'Marshall Plan'
style programme to help the country back to prosperity. The offers included
Dollars 15m to help clear some of the 10m mines scattered across the country
which kill or maim about 300 people a month. The money was pledged at a
two-day conference on the reconstruction of Cambodia. The delegates, from 32
countries, the EU and 12 international organisations, noted progress in
market reforms, trade liberalisation, improved tax revenues, reduced
inflation and stable exchange rates.

Mr Richard Leakey, Kenya's foremost conservationist, was yesterday back in
charge of the Kenya Wildlife Service after international pressure for his
reinstatement prevailed over a vilification campaign conducted by
politicians of the ruling Kanu party. President Daniel arap Moi said he
would not accept Mr Leakey's resignation, submitted in January, following
accusations of racism, arrogance and corruption by Mr William ole Ntimama,
the powerful minister for local government. Diplomats, donors and tour
operators warned President Moi that Mr Leakey's departure would do
incalculable damage to Kenya's reputation as a world leader in wildlife
conservation, which underpins a Dollars 450m-a-year tourist industry. Mr
Leakey is said to have placed some tough conditions for his return,
including the removal of his fiercest political opponents.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US retail sales rose sharply last month but a large downward revision to
figures for January indicated the rate of growth of consumer spending has
probably moderated since the end of last year. The Commerce Department said
sales rose 1.5 per cent last month and by 7.5 per cent in the year to
February. But officials also revised down estimates for January to show a
decline in sales of 1.6 per cent from December rather than the fall of 0.5
per cent initially reported. The figures are not adjusted for inflation.
'The weather is playing havoc with first quarter data,' said Mr Joseph Liro,
chief economist at S G Warburg in New York. He said flat sales in January
and February taken together reflected the very cold weather and the impact
of the earthquake in southern California. A large increase in sales was
likely this month, he said.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Survey of Residential Property (3): Where German efficiency
falls down - Lack of information can turn buying a home into a complicated
process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The German residential property market is neither transparent nor efficient,
says Oscar Kienzle, head of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley's German operations.
He explains: 'Go to Knight Frank in London and they will tell you exactly
how much you have to pay to buy a flat in Knightsbridge. The market there is
efficient in that, if you are prepared to pay more than the odds, you will
definitely get what you want.
'From the seller's point of view, the converse holds true - drop your price
from the market level and you'll find a buyer.'
But that, says Kienzle, is not the case in Germany where information on what
is for sale and for how much is hard to come by. There are no 'for sale'
signs and national chains of estate agents are few.
As you might expect in Germany's strongly regionalised economy, the market
is local in character. Knowledge gleaned in Munich will not be of much help
if you are posted to Frankfurt or Dusseldorf.
Even within the regions, the market is fragmented. In the Frankfurt area,
for example, few agents will be able to give you an overview of prices for
the whole city and its satellite towns.
The market in the Frankfurt region is controlled by at least 1,000 Maklers
(brokers), most of whom specialise in a small area. The expert on the market
for flats in the expensive west end of the city centre is unlikely to know
much about villas for sale in nearby dormitory towns such as Bad Homburg,
Bad Vilbel or Kronberg.
Assuming fluency in German, and a degree of familiarity with local tax law,
you should reckon on at least a year between arriving in Germany and buying
a house, says one banker who has just bought a property on the outskirts of
Frankfurt.
'The most important thing you must bring with you when you're considering
buying a house is time,' agrees Kienzle.
The inefficiency of the market means there are bargains to be had
occasionally - but you have to be there long enough to spot them when they
become available.
It follows that international executives who might be posted to Frankfurt
would be well advised to rent a flat or a house on arrival and buy only if
they are likely to be staying for five years or more.
The chance of making a substantial capital gain in less than five years is
small, says Dr Walter Fuhrberg, managing director of Blumenauer Immobilien,
one of the larger property agencies in Frankurt.
House prices in the Frankfurt area have risen at 4 to 5 per cent a year
since the late 1980s - not enough to justify a speculative purchase,
especially in view of the costs and complications of buying. This a far cry
from the giddy price movements in the UK residential property market.
But the stable price development reflects Germans' deep-rooted fear of
inflation as well as a reluctance to treat home-buying as a form of
financial speculation. 'Germans do not regard houses and flats as a
commodity, as something to be bought and sold,' says a broker in the
Stuttgart area.
'Buying a house is very serious and very formal. For most people, it is an
enormous step signifying that you've made it and you are settling down for
life.'
Indeed, in Germany as a whole, only around 40 per cent of the population
owns a house, compared with a Europe-wide average of 60 per cent.
If you are very rich, there are tax advantages associated with owning
residential property and renting it out.
There are also tax benefits if you build your own property - very popular in
a country where, unlike Britain, there is little sentiment attached to
living in an old house.
Another incentive to buy comes from the low cost of money: interest rates
for home loans have fallen far more steeply that short-term rates in the
past 18 months.
In the Frankfurt area, prices range from DM500,000 (Pounds 200,000) for a
small flat in a good area to DM5m or more for a villa in the Taunus hills
outside the town. Rents range from DM15-DM25 per square metre, often with a
service charge and bills on top.
It could be that the cost of financing a mortgage is now below the rental
costs of living in a similar property. Against this, you must weigh the fee
of 5 per cent of the value of the house (plus value added tax) which you pay
on purchase and maintenance costs. There are also the non-financial
considerations - such as the sheer complexity of finding and buying the
house in which you would like to live.
Renting remains the most straightforward option for all but the most
long-term expatriates. At the top end of the market, there is no shortage of
properties, and rents have fallen over the past couple of years.
Renting is not without its complexities and frustrations, however.
There is nothing more irritating than paying a fee to the Makler, who often
seems to have done nothing other than put an advertisement in the paper and
wait to be overwhelmed by calls from expatriates. The fee is two months'
rent, plus VAT, fixed by law.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Survey of Residential Property (4): Why Austria stays tough
 -The difficulties facing foreigners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AUDREY POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not impossible to buy property in Austria if you are a foreigner, just
difficult. And it helps to have an experienced adviser.
Often, people are told that foreigners cannot buy homes there, but a
spokesman at Austria's embassy in London says: 'That is totally wrong. We
let foreign people buy. It depends on the area.'
Yet, a wide variety of reasons continues to be given for not letting people
buy. Among them: Austria is a small country (32,378 sq miles); wealthy
foreigners building holiday homes in the best scenic areas have kept out
local people and put up prices; and there would be ghost villages populated
for only part of the year.
Another embassy staffer had a further explanation for Austria's resistance:
that, with only 13.5 per cent of the country suitable for settlement, there
was a projected increase of 18 per cent in the population of 7.6m by 2011.
He conceded, however, that if his country joined the European Union, some
changes would have to be made.
Indeed, the requirement for citizens of other EU countries to be allowed to
buy in Austria has been one of the main sticking points in negotiations for
its entry. A referendum on joining will probably be held in June.
Some people have assumed that Austria might, like Denmark, get an opt-out
arrangement on property acquisition. But the EU is becoming impatient with
members making such requests. In effect, it is telling applicants for
membership: 'If you want to join, you know the rules.'
With some of Austria's neighbours having serious problems, you might think
people would not want to buy a holiday home there. But they do. Travel agent
Thomas Cook says Austria has been its number one destination for skiing
holidays this year.
Austria is divided into provinces, and each applies the law in its own way -
so property regulations vary from area to area. One British woman involved
in selling Austrian property says: 'It is a strange country. They arrange
the rules as they go along.
'I am not saying there are no ways around the rules, but they try to control
their area and do not want huge units. They are very insular and protective
of their country. But they are charming people.'
For a foreigner thinking of buying an Austrian property, what might you get
at the upper level?
Peter Marschall, of E. &amp; M. Chalupa in Vienna, says: 'In the eastern part of
Austria, particularly Vienna, it is no problem for foreigners to buy
property. But in the western part, especially the Tyrol and other skiing and
holiday areas, it is very difficult.'
Marschall suggests three properties available to non-Austrians offered by
his agency in association with Sotheby's International Realty. One is Villa
am Gallitzinberg, in a popular residential district 15 minutes from Vienna
city centre. It is a 1960s house, modernised extensively, with 10 reception
rooms and five bedrooms.
There is accommodation for staff plus a colourful indoor swimming pool and
garaging for 10 cars. For the summer, there is an outdoor pool, too. Price:
Pounds 2m.
On the outskirts of Salzburg, and also built in the 1960s (for an assistant
to Herbert von Karajan, the conductor) is Landsitz Prinzessin von Preussen.
It follows local style, blends with the countryside and has views of the
mountains and Lake Fuschi.
The main house has three reception rooms and four bedrooms, plus a staff
flat and basement party room. Guest accommodation, in the form of a
fortified tower, includes three bedrooms.
The two properties are connected by a building which houses a swimming pool
and garages, and there is a chapel in the grounds. Facilities for golf,
riding and tennis are nearby. Price: Pounds 1.7m.
Then there is the Landhaus im Ausseerland, which is being built in a country
setting an hour from Salzburg. This is a five-bedroom villa that combines
modern architecture with the regional style.
Built in four sections, the main and secondary building and garage are
connected by a glass winter garden. The guest accommodation is separate.
To the south lies Grundslee, one of Austria's most beautiful lakes. The
property, priced at Pounds 900,000, should be completed by the summer and
John Prince, of Sotheby's in London, says non-nationals should have no legal
problems acquiring it.
Maria Holinski, of Wika, an agency with offices in Austria and Munich, says:
'The law about buying in Austria is the same all over, but how it is applied
is up to the province and the community.' Like other agents she complains,
wearily, that 'regulations have been changed yet again'.
In certain parts, she added, there were holiday areas which had been set
aside for second homes and could be sold to non-Austrians. But potential
foreign buyers were looking for something more individual.
Her agency has several apartments available to foreign purchasers, including
one at Badaussee, costing from Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 260,000. But there
is a semi-detached house for Pounds 85,000.
Some of Wika's properties are in the province of Styria, which Holinski
calls the Lake District of Austria; they include a pied a terre at Pounds
25,000. Allow for buying costs of 10 to 12 per cent.
Leonard Anthony &amp; Colin Essex is a British agency that specialises in
Austrian properties. It also favours Styria, where it has a branch.
'It is the second-largest and probably the most attractive province, much of
it covered with forests,' says the agency's Tony Mansfield. 'Foreigners are
allowed to buy certain types of property there.' He has homes in designated
holiday areas around the old village of Bad Mitterndorf, about an hour from
Salzburg airport.
Mansfield can offer around 40 furnished re-sale bungalows, chalets and
apartments, or apartments in small, new developments. Prices range from
Pounds 28,000 for a studio to Pounds 125,000 for a new, two-bedroom
apartment with balcony. One group of flats is in a school that is being
converted.
He says his agency sells only properties that are available to foreigners,
although everyone has to apply for permission to own. And while there is no
trouble getting a mortgage, Mansfield adds that potential British buyers
probably would get a better rate if they took out their loan in the UK.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Belarus balks at paying price of economic union with Russia:
John Lloyd considers why talks with Moscow have failed and what the future
holds for the small Slav state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An attempt to merge the economies of Russia and Belarus appears to have
failed - because Russia's conditions were too strict for the small Slav
state. Belarus now faces a grim future as inflation soars and enterprises
run out of orders.
The breakdown in negotiations between the two countries is also an
indication that Russia is prepared to shoulder responsibility for its
neighbours' ailing economies only on terms which amount to a complete
takeover - terms which some in the Russian government believe will be
accepted by the former Soviet states sooner or later.
Belarus and Russia began negotiating earlier this year but both were careful
not to release any details. Mr Stanislav Bogdankevich, governor of the Bank
of Belarus, has now revealed however, that the Russian terms included full
control over monetary expansion, the abolition of an independent national
bank and its substitution by a branch of the Russian central bank, and a
unified state budget.
Though Minsk's political leaders - the least independence- minded of the new
ruling classes in the former Soviet states - had been prepared to go a long
way in diluting their independence, they are not prepared to disappear
entirely into a Russian state, according to Mr Bogdankevich.
In an initial draft of the agreement, the Russian side had appeared willing
to consider allowing Minsk to print its own supply of roubles and to
exchange the devalued Belarussian currency one-to-one with the rouble.
According to an Interfax news agency report, research centres in Belarus
have already drawn up proposals for a radical shift away from dependence on
Russia if the deal is not signed.
The agency quotes the programme as proposing a 'Baltic and Black Sea union'
including the three former Soviet Baltic republics, Ukraine, Moldova and
some east European countries under the Nato umbrella, acting as a buffer
between Russia and the west.
The programme, which appears to be drafted in a deliberate spirit of enmity
to a Russia seen as spurning Belarus's advance, calls for the immediate
creation of a separate currency and of tight border control between the two
countries.
It also proposes dismantling 'as quickly as possible' the strategic
facilities used by Russia at Vileika and Gantsevichi. This would, say the
Belarussian experts, cost Russia Rbs150,000bn and complicate its control
over the Baltic and nuclear submarine fleets.
However, the unreality of the programme is underscored by the near collapse
of the present temporary Belarus currency, the lack of any reform in the
country and the unwillingness of the Baltic or east European states to be
associated with the former Soviet republics.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Slovak deputies topple premier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON, East Europe Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Slovakia enters a period of deepening political tension this weekend after
prime minister Vladimir Meciar and his government were toppled by a
no-confidence vote in the Slovak parliament yesterday. Deputies approved the
motion by 78-2 with 70 abstentions, many of them former Meciar supporters.
Mr Meciar led his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) to victory in
the June 1992 Czechoslovak general elections. But he was then quickly
out-manoeuvred by the Czech leader, Mr Vaclav Klaus. The Czech refusal to
finance his demands for autonomy just short of independence forced the
Slovak leader to take this country of 5m people into an independence which
opinion polls showed only a small minority of Slovak nationalists wanted.
Since then Mr Meciar's highly personalised and aggressive political style
has lost support for him and his party against the background of a widening
gulf between living standards in the Czech republic, which has forged ahead
with market reforms, and Slovakia. The new republic came into existence in
January 1993 with a weaker economy heavily weighted towards former Comecon
markets and based largely on inefficient heavy industry. Since independence
market reforms have virtually stopped and the economy has declined further
against a background of high inflation, rising unemployment and a
depreciating currency.
Until now Mr Meciar has been able to hold on to power by force of his
personality and indecisiveness and divisions among opposition groups, of
which the most important are the former communists turned social democrats
led by Mr Peter Weiss, the Slovak Nationalist party and the Christian
Democrats.
Under the Slovak constitution President Michal Kovac is obliged to dissolve
the government and designate a leading politician to try and form a new
government. Once a new cabinet is formed it has to be approved by parliament
within 30 days.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Owen in warning to UN on Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the present peace momentum in Bosnia-Hercegovina stalls, and if all three
sides appear determined to continue the war, then the United Nations should
considering pulling out, Lord Owen, co-chairman of the Geneva peace talks on
the former Yugoslavia, says in a lecture prepared for delivery last night to
the Pescatore Fondation in Luxembourg.
The UN should 'not contribute to prolonging it (the war) through a third
winter', he says.
Although he does not spell out whether the UN humanitarian aid effort helped
fuel the military machine of all three sides in Bosnia, Lord Owen, as he
suggested earlier this year, believes that aid, frequently hijacked by the
three armies, has indirectly prolonged the fighting.
As the war erupted, first in Croatia and later in Bosnia, Lord Owen says
that 'little thought was given to involving from the outset either the UN or
the Russian Federation'.
He believes the Russian's readiness to extend the consensus working
arrangements in the Security Council developed in the Gulf War, to
Yugoslavia had been taken 'too much for granted' and 'nearly came unstuck in
February 1994' when Nato issued the Bosnian Serbs with an ultimatum to
withdraw its heavy weapons from around Sarajevo or else risk air strikes.
He has little sympathy for Washington's 'role' in the present conflict - or
the European Union's belief that it was 'all too ready to prove itself as an
independent force in the field of foreign affairs'.
Indeed, Lord Owen believes there are lessons the EU can learn: the conflict
could not have been solved by the EU alone. 'Once it was clear the US would
not become involved, and therefore Nato as well, we were too slow to involve
the UN.' And second, had the threat of force - Nato air strikes, for
instance - been used early, particularly in Vukovar in late 1991, perhaps
the war would not have spread to Bosnia. But that would have required
support from the US.
The only hope for an early peace is Russia, the EU and the US working
together, he concludes.

rule his economically stricken country alone, by presidential decree, should
parliamentary elections later this month fail to produce a legally
acceptable result.
Such a move, which could place Mr Kravchuk into a similar confrontation with
his parliament as President Boris Yeltsin faced in Russia last year, is now
being openly discussed by his close political advisers.
One senior adviser to the Ukrainian president said 'we are very sure the
parliamentary election (scheduled for March 27) will not produce a result.
It will be a good opportunity for Kravchuk' to 'press ahead with reforms and
stay in power until the end of his term until 1996'.
The adviser said that Mr Kravchuk had discussed the possibility of ruling
Ukraine by decree when he met President Bill Clinton in Washington on March
4.
While neither Mr Kravchuk nor the parliament has a record in radical
economic reform, the president blames parliament for blocking the few reform
measures he has tried to push through. Last year the parliament foiled an
attempt by Mr Kravchuk to loosen government control of land.
The opening Mr Kravchuk would need to run the Ukraine unhindered by
parliament arises out of a convoluted election law passed last November by
the existing parliament - elected while Ukraine was still part of the Soviet
Union.
Some 6,000 candidates have registered for the March 27 poll, an average of
13 per voting district. Under the law, to win in the first round of voting a
candidate must secure more than half the votes cast and more than half the
electorate must cast their votes.
To win in a second round of voting planned for April, the top two candidates
in any district will square off under the same rules. Mr Kravchuck's
advisers believe that this is where the new voting law is flawed and that it
will be difficult to draw more than half the electorate out to vote once and
nearly impossible for a second time.
If the president and his men are right in predicting a low voter turn-out,
parliament's electoral commission will be required by law to declare the
elections invalid, and thus potentially pave the way for presidential rule.
According to a presidential adviser, Mr Kravchuk would finally have his
opportunity to reform Ukraine's disastrous economy by decree without a
parliament to get in his way. He would also cancel June presidential
elections and convene a constituent assembly to redesign a political model -
presidential or parliamentary - for the country.
Last month Mr Kravchuk announced that he would not stand for early
presidential elections this June but this now appears to have been a tactic
to prepare the ground for cancelling presidential elections, disbanding
parliament and taking control of the country. Mr Kravchuck remains the only
Ukrainian politician put in power by popular vote since the republic became
independent.
The west is particularly concerned that Mr Kravchuk should remain in power
until an agreement to scrap its nuclear missile arsenal, signed in January
in Moscow, is completed. Ukraine's parliament has yet to approve the 1968
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, making Mr Kravchuck the sole guarantor of
the deal.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Mixed reaction to rescue plan for Air France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Unions representing the 40,000 staff of Air France were mixed in their
reaction yesterday to the rescue plan providing for FFr20bn (Pounds 2.29bn)
of state aid in return for a three-year wage freeze and 5,000 voluntary
redundancies.
Mr Christian Blanc, Air France's president, has asked for the unions' formal
reaction on March 28, but said that if he cannot get agreement from the
airline's 14 unions, he might organise a referendum.
Force Ouvriere, representing a majority of ground staff, reacted favourably,
while the communist-leaning CGT federation, complained that the government
is blackmailing it by tying the state aid to unions' approval of the plan.
The outcome may be decided by small groups, like the mechanics union which
said yesterday it wanted promotions, if not pay increases, to go ahead over
the 1994-97 period.
The government yesterday kept studiously silent in contrast to its erratic
tactics last October when it backed a more stringent plan for forced pay and
jobs cuts by Mr Bernard Attali, then the Air France president, and then
suddenly abandoned both the man and the plan.
Mr Attali yesterday published his book 'Sky Wars: Five Years at the Controls
of Air France', in which he says that if the government had just kept its
sang froid 'for a few more days', it would have beaten the Air France strike
and saved itself money. Instead, he was disavowed by the transport minister
on television on October 24, and immediately resigned.
In his book, Mr Attali defends his decision to buy Air Inter and increase
control over Air Inter, decisions which are implicitly criticised in the
Blanc plan as helping plunge the airline deeper into the red.
Rejecting the premise of the Attali rescue plan, Mr Blanc has said that
staffing and pay levels 'are not the problem at Air France, which is one of
organisation and structure'. 'I want to do away with this myth that the
productivity difference between Air France and BA is based on the number of
personnel and level of pay.'
Recalculating BA's workforce to include work that the UK carrier has
contracted out but which the French airline still does in-house, Mr Blanc
said that in 1992 BA effectively had staff of 49,000 and Air France 44,000.
BA thus had a workforce 11 per cent larger than Air France, but turnover
which was 21 per cent bigger. The planned 10 per cent cut in Air France
staff from 40,000 now to 44,000 by 1997 would give Air France the same ratio
of staff to turnover as BA.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Administration assails media over Whitewater
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The White House yesterday denounced the mainstream media for giving credence
to unsubstantiated Whitewater rumours that have moved the financial markets
this week.
Ms Dee Dee Myers, presidential press secretary, took particular exception to
a chain of events on Thursday. This started with an obscure conservative
newsletter in Washington which raised new doubts, but offered no evidence,
about the suicide last summer of Vincent Foster, the former deputy legal
counsel.
This was immediately picked up by Rush Limbaugh, the popular right-wing talk
show host, and graduated immediately to the markets, where US bonds and the
dollar took a hammering. Versions of the rumour were reported mostly in
yesterday's newspaper money market columns as a factor influencing trading
sentiment.
Ms Myers said: 'I think anybody who may have lost money yesterday should
blame David Smick (co-publisher of the newsletter) and Rush Limbaugh. The
report was completely irresponsible and unsubstantiated. There is not a
shred of credible evidence to suggest that it is true.'
She accused the Reuters news agency of being 'one of the worst offenders'
because its market reports had noted the rumour - along with denials from
the White House and other sources. But it prompted a flurry of questions
from other news organisations. 'Since when are we in the position of having
to prove a negative?' she asked. 'I think we should pause and ask why.'
Market interest in the Whitewater affair has suddenly grown keen this week.
The FT office in Washington has received, for the first time, several calls
from financial institutions seeking either additional information or to
verify the many rumours circulating. They have been disappointed.
Mr Lloyd Cutler, newly installed White House legal counsel, and Mr David
Gergen, the presidential counsellor, both took comfort in the fact that
legal proceedings had begun to investigate possible interference by
administration officials in the inquiries into the failed Arkansas savings
and loan company at the centre of the Whitewater affair.
Mr Cutler said of Thursday's first round of grand jury testimony: 'It may
look bad, but when it becomes clear exactly what happens in those meetings I
don't think it amounts to very much.'
Mr Gergen referred to 'a difficult day', but added that he thought people
would be 'comforted by the fact that the president has made it very plain
that this White House will be co-operative, honest, forthright, and
aggressively so'.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Former minister is arrested in Tokyo: Nakamura to face
bribery charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A former Japanese construction minister yesterday became the first national
politician to be arrested in the country's biggest corruption scandal since
the second world war.
Mr Kishiro Nakamura was denied his wish to be arrested on the steps of
parliament, and instead humbly gave himself up at the Tokyo prosecutors'
office, to face bribery charges.
His arrest was triggered by a national assembly vote, at the public
prosecutor's request, to lift Mr Nakamura's parliamentary immunity, the
first time parliament has been asked to do this for 27 years.
It marks a new level in the legal assault on corruption which has led to the
arrest of more than 30 people, including local politicians, executives from
Japan's seven leading construction groups and the head of a paper company.
It is also a fresh stain on the already tarnished political image of the
opposition Liberal Democratic party, of which Mr Nakamura was a rising star
until he resigned from it on Wednesday.
Speculation has grown recently that the prosecutors would turn to a national
figure, on the grounds that they have ample evidence from their many
detainees and are under pressure to appease public disgust with political
corruption. Mr Nakamura is expected to deny charges that he received Y10m
(Pounds 63,600) from Kajima, a leading construction group, to ensure that a
public inquiry into bid-rigging in the construction industry came to
nothing.
He was construction minister in Mr Kiichi Miyazawa's government from
December 1992 until last August. However, Mr Nakamura is accused of
receiving the bribe in early 1992, as chairman of the LDP's anti-trust
panel. If found guilty, he could face up to five years' imprisonment.
The construction industry has been a generous source of often illicit cash
for leading political parties, exposed with the arrest last March of Mr Shin
Kanemaru, political godfather of the LDP and patron of Mr Nakamura.
Mr Kanemaru's downfall triggered the chain of events that led to the
collapse of the LDP government last July and the adoption of laws to curb
political funding and reform the electoral system. Mr Kanemaru is now facing
trial for evading tax of Y1.8bn of construction industry donations.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Toshio's tourists turn a pretty profit: A businessman's
novel way of beating Japanese high prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Toshio Miyaji is a popular man. He's setting off from Tokyo to London and
Paris on Monday and more than 10,000 women want to go with him. The 100 he
chose to accompany him he picked out of a hat.
The reasons for Mr Miyaji's unusual attraction are not too hard to find. Not
only is the 64-year-old Japanese shopkeeper paying for the women's travel
and accommodation, he is also giving them Y500,000 (some Pounds 3,000) each
to spend on luxury goods in the most expensive stores Paris and London can
offer.
Mr Miyaji's intentions are strictly honourable. He's out to make money. The
differences in the prices of luxury goods in Europe and Japan are so great
that, in spite of the costs of a week's stay, he can resell the goods in
Tokyo at a profit.
Mr Miyaji knows he can make a profit on the trip because he has done it
before. At the beginning of last year, he led two-thirds of his 60 employees
on a free trip to Paris to buy Louis Vuitton and Chanel handbags.
'Last time the accommodation and flight cost Y470,000 per person and I only
made Y880,000 on the whole journey,' says Mr Miyaji. This time he has hotel
and airline sponsorship. 'It's only costing me Y200,000 for each housewife.'
Although he may be popular in Tokyo, Mr Miyaji is less well esteemed among
Europe's luxury goods makers. When last in Paris he found his photograph
posted up in a Louis Vuitton store. 'They didn't want to sell to me,' he
complains.
Lipstick is one of the main objectives of his latest journey. 'The
difference in prices is outrageous. A Chanel lipstick costs Y3,500 in Tokyo,
but only Y1,500 in Paris. A poll showed that 82 per cent of Japanese women
want to wear foreign lipstick, but a law dating back 50 years limits imports
to 10 per cent of the market.
'Women represent 70 per cent of my customers and I want to do something for
them,' claims Mr Miyaji. 'I'm going to import the lipstick back into Japan
and sell it at a discount. That's punishable by two years in jail. But I'm
prepared to go to jail. It's bad to violate laws, but I'm resolved to fight
an inappropriate ones. Unless I do so, consumers will continue to suffer
high prices.'
Mr Miyaji does not expect to go to jail. He has built up a formidable retail
empire, Jonan Denki, by pushing the authorities and Japanese manufacturing
establishment just so far.
In just 20 years, he created a Y12bn-a-year chain of six Tokyo stores
through aggressive discounting.
Jonan Denki is built on cash. Mr Miyaji's shambolic office, littered with
Chanel eau de toilette, cheap star-shaped transparent plastic clocks, and
the odd bottle of Russian vodka and brandy, is also adorned by an automatic
cash counting machine of the kind usually found in banks. As he pushes a
handful of money from his wallet through the machine, he proudly claims the
machine is the only one operated by a retail store in Tokyo. The wad comes
to a disappointing Y300,000.
Mr Miyaji's explains his ultimate objective is not to make money, but to
create a revolution in retailing.
'The Berlin wall may have fallen. But here in Japan nothing alters. We must
force change,' he says. At the vanguard of his struggle will be 100
housewives wielding lipstick.

FT  12 MAR 94 / IRA believes attacks will lead to Ulster concessions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, JIMMY BURNS and MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, indicated yesterday that the IRA
believes it can win further political concessions from the British
government by keeping up its campaign of violence.
As a security review at Heathrow airport was completed following two mortar
attacks in less than 36 hours, Mr Adams said that the incidents 'should have
a major accelerating effect upon the British government'. On Thursday, he
had warned of more 'spectacular' reminders that the conflict was continuing.
His latest remarks came as the row intensified over security at Heathrow and
Scotland Yard confirmed it had undertaken a thorough review of security
arrangements at the airport.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish
counterpart, yesterday issued a defiant joint statement saying the 'men of
violence' would not deflect the two governments in their search for peace.
With some Tory MPs demanding a security crackdown on the IRA and Labour
accusing ministers of 'delay, neglect and wrong priorities' over airport
security, the two leaders accused supporters of violence of making 'a grave
miscalculation' and committed the security forces to a continuing
anti-terrorist drive.
As well as an increase in the number of police, options being considered as
a result of the Heathrow security review are thought to include increased
video surveillance and temporary road blocks. The Ministry of Defence said
last night that the army was prepared to help patrol the airport.
Anti-terrorist experts are trying to establish why mortars fired on Heathrow
in the two attacks failed to detonate. One theory is that they were designed
not to explode on impact, generating publicity but minimising the political
risk of large-scale casualties.
Balpa, the pilots' union, said it had launched its own investigation into
apparent security lapses at the airport. Pilots are concerned that after the
first mortar attack on the airport's northern runway on Wednesday night,
more than 20 aircraft were allowed to take off before it was closed. BAA
said last night that Heathrow was fully operational.
The British Tourist Authority reported little reaction to the attacks. Mr
Stuart Crouch, chairman of the British Incoming Tour Operators' Association,
said he had received no reports of foreign visitors cancelling UK trips.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Trade gap grows as recovery pulls in more imports: Deficit
fears hit sterling as receding hope of rate cuts depresses shares and bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's trade gap widened abruptly in December, as the recovering economy
drew in more imports than expected.
Strong import volumes of a broad range of goods, combined with particularly
poor exports to the European Union, increased the visible deficit to Pounds
1.57bn in December from Pounds 1.28bn in November. The Central Statistical
Office said the underlying trend also pointed to a growing visible deficit.
The spectre of a widening trade gap as growth gathers speed put downward
pressure on the pound, which fell almost 1 1/2 pfennigs yesterday to close
in London at DM2.521.
Robust imports in the last quarter of 1993 - underlying volumes were up 3.5
per cent on the previous quarter against a 3 per cent drop in exports -
added to evidence that recovery is well established, reducing hopes of an
early cut in interest rates.
Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, backed up this view in
Washington when he dismissed the need for 'an artificial stimulus' to spur
growth.
This sentiment helped depress gilts and London share prices. The FT-SE 100
index fell 42 to 3,191.9, its lowest close this year, for a loss this week
of 86.1.
Mr George, questioned by reporters after speaking at an international
banking conference in Washington on Thursday, said UK economic growth could
pick up to an annual rate of 3 per cent over the next 18 months. That is a
higher rate than the Treasury's official forecast of 2.5 per cent growth in
gross domestic product in 1994 and the first half of 1995.
Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at Morgan Stanley, said that 'one of the
messages of today's trade data was that the economy was uncomfortably firm
at the end of last year'.
Adding to unease about the UK's tendency to satisfy domestic demand through
imports was the news from the CSO that revisions to EU trade figures for the
first 11 months of 1993 had added an extra Pounds 750m to imports, but only
Pounds 40m to exports.
The CSO warned that the latest figures should be treated with caution, given
the continuing problems of the new system for monitoring intra-EU trade
flows. Many economists suspect that Intrastat - the new method - has
systematically underestimated imports. These revisions appear to confirm
those fears.
For 1993 as a whole, the UK's visible trade deficit was Pounds 13.42bn,
little changed from 1992's Pounds 13.4bn. It was nonetheless Pounds 2bn more
than the government forecast in November's Budget.
The widening of the trade gap in December was wholly due to a sharp
deterioration in trade with the rest of the EU. The deficit widened from a
sharply revised Pounds 543m in November to Pounds 903m.
Mr Richard Needham, trade minister, said the increase in the deficit in
December was not surprising given the continued recession in continental
Europe, the UK's biggest market. Exports to Europe, excluding oil and
erratic items, fell 9.5 per cent in the last quarter of 1993. Imports rose 3
per cent in the period. The Treasury warned against reading too much into
the figures.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Treasury urges prompt sale of nuclear power industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury is pressing hard for Britain's nuclear generation industry to
be privatised before the next election, with incentives for managers to keep
down the huge costs of decommissioning power stations.
In the run-up to the nuclear review, which the Department of Trade and
Industry hopes to announce in the next few weeks, the Treasury has thrown
its support behind privatising Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear within
two years.
It believes new legislation would not be needed for the nuclear industry
sell-off, which could be covered by electricity privatisation measures
approved by parliament in the late 1980s.
Britain's nuclear power stations were withdrawn from privatisation five
years ago because of fears that shareholders could face big liabilities from
the cost of decommissioning plants and dealing with waste.
Nuclear Electric was subsequently established to manage the English and
Welsh generating industry in the public sector while Scottish Nuclear was
set up to run the two Scottish plants.
Treasury ministers reject the need to separate out from Nuclear Electric the
older Magnox stations, the first to be withdrawn from the sale of the
electricity industry.
They want Nuclear Electric to be sold off as one unit, although they may
consider reallocating some of its plants to Scottish Nuclear to make it more
viable as a stand-alone company in the private sector.
There are strong doubts in the City that the industry can be privatised with
Magnox liabilities, particularly as a way still has to be found of splitting
the decommissioning and waste costs associated with the public sector from
those of the private sector.
To minimise costs, running into billions of pounds, the Treasury is looking
to the nuclear review to generate 'innovative measures' to build in
incentives to keep liabilities to a minimum.
Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, is known to be more cautious than the
Treasury. Although he believes the future of the nuclear industry is in the
private sector, he is understood to question if a quick privatisation is
practical.
After the abrupt halt called to the sale of the nuclear industry 1989, the
DTI wants to ensure that the second attempt to get the industry into the
private sector is not bungled by being rushed.
The Treasury which believes the government will gain nothing by standing
still, wants a decision to sell off Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear to
be made by the summer.

Armed supporters of the Afrikaner Resistance Movement drive through the
Bophuthatswana capital of Mmabatho yesterday. The South African army later
moved into the black 'homeland', chasing out rightwing whites and attempting
to restore order after riots left dozens of people dead. The events were
seen as a humiliating defeat for the right wing. Report, Page 22

FT  12 MAR 94 / Survey of Residential Property (1): Tunnel to increased
value - The Chunnel is about to change life in northern France and Kent.
Gerald Cadogan looks at the implications for the property market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On May 6 the Queen and President Mitterrand will declare the Channel Tunnel
open. That should be the starting signal for a recovery in the property
market in Kent and north eastern France.
At the moment, agents report more inquiries, but the markets in both
countries are still quiet and prices low, especially in France. That is an
excellent long-term reason to buy.
Le Shuttle's high starting prices for a vehicle and its passengers will
eventually come down creating price competition between rail, ferry,
catamaran and Hovercraft.
Far-sighted prospective buyers looking near Calais include hauliers wanting
to set up a base on the Continent, and Asian entrepreneurs who see an
advantage in being close to Belgium. John Hart, author of A House in France,
notes: 'It is not a rush. The tunnel does not mean much to the continentals.
Most of the ferry trade is from Britain to France.'
The British are mainly looking for houses, rather than apartments, although
French and Dutch buyers are also in the market. Inquiries about northern
French property picked up just before Christmas, says Maggie Kelly, of
French agents L'Abri-tanique in Hesdin.
Growing confidence in the UK market is slowly stimulating interest in French
property. UK buyers can now sell their UK home to put money into a main
residence or second home in France. Prices have stopped falling in northern
France and hopes are high that the tunnel, motorways and new railways will
resuscitate the region.
Britons who bought in 1989 or 1990 may find it a good time to sell, if they
did not pay too much at the time and have renovated their properties since.
But some paid far too much.
Spectacular price cuts can be found. For example, a glorious, repossessed
abbey with five acres in Tortefontaine, with a 12th century hall and many
outbuildings, is on sale at around FFr750,000 (Pounds 86,000) from agents
Latitudes or L'Abri-tanique. Four or five years ago it cost FFr2.5m (after
being put on the market at FFr4m). A mill near Montreuil, which cost FFr2m
in 1989, sold last year for FFr500,000.
French banks and mortgage providers have taken it 'on the chin', said Kelly,
and some smaller banks in Calais are none too happy when Britons seek loans.
However, show you have the cash and there are bargains to be had. A house in
Hesdin, or a nearby country cottage, make good weekend retreats and are far
cheaper than their English equivalents.
A small house in Montreuil, a walled town with cobbled streets, costs
FFr280,000 from La Residence. A small, partly-restored farmhouse near
Montreuil can be bought for FFr135,000 from A House in France. Thirty
minutes' drive from Boulogne, a long, low, Norman-style, half-timbered,
farmhouse is for sale at FFr515,250, and 50 minutes away another costs
FFr436,800 (reduced from FFr650,000).
Near St Omer agent Cote d'Opale is selling an 18th century chateau with
wings added in 1908 for FFr4.46m. La Residence offers another with 28
watercress beds and 12 hectares (30 acres) in good condition for FFr2.6m and
a flat in town for FFr380,000.
In Hesdin, the Wine Society, an English-based group of wine enthusiasts, has
an outlet for members where they can pick up society-recommended wines free
of UK taxes.
When Kelly sees Range Rover and Jaguar drivers collecting their cases of
wine in Hesdin, she would like them to drop into her office 100 metres away
and choose a house as well.
Latitudes has on its books an 18th century town house with internal
courtyard for FFr1.3m, a snip when you think what you would pay in Paris.
Near Fruges is a water mill for FFr900,000 and, in the valley of the
Ternoise, an 18th century brick house needing work is available for just
FFr450,000.
On the coast, Boulogne is a smart, pleasant town far preferable to Calais.
It has good shops - including the Philippe Olivier cheese shop  - and
restaurants. The French favourite is Le Touquet, still an elegant place for
Parisians to spend le weekend. Shops open in winter on Saturdays and Sundays
 -and close on Wednesdays and Thursday mornings. You can play golf and
tennis, ride, go to the casino and live in an elegant domaine in the Foret.
As in Deauville, the town's cachet has kept prices up. Penny Zoldan, of
Latitudes, has a flat in Le Touquet and sees it as a good base for
foreigners.
Nearby, at Hardelot, there are plenty of building plots for sale beside the
two golf courses (consult Latitudes). Outside Le Touquet, A House in France
offers a chateau complete with fortification wall and tunnels for FFr1.3m.
In the countryside beyond Dieppe, a typical Norman house, restored and
including most of the furniture and a cottage, is for sale for Pounds
125,000 from Domus Abroad.
Towards Paris, off the autoroute from Calais, Philip Hawkes is selling the
18th century Chateau de Pronleroy for FFr13m. Egerton and Knight Frank &amp;
Rutley is offering the more recent Chateau de la Chaussee, near Chantilly,
the centre of French racing, at FFr19m.
At the other end of the tunnel Cluttons reports Belgians and Dutch
registering at the Canterbury office for period cottages for around Pounds
200,000, and French and Belgians at the Folkestone office - where David
Parry reports that Arabs are interested in blocks of flats on the sea front.
'The tunnel has more psychological impact than anything. Vendors see it as a
bonus. Buyers don't see that yet.'
Once the tunnel is open, said Parry, industry will be attracted to the area
and people will move in. Central and east Kent need a stimulus but it may
take four or five years before there is any evidence of new opportunities in
the area.
An apartment in The Grand at Folkestone, the former hotel, is for sale from
Cluttons for Pounds 89,500. Along the M2, Strutt &amp; Parker offers 52 St
Margaret's Street, Rochester, a Grade II* late 17th century house, for
Pounds 190,000, and a Tudor (1508) and Georgian Kentish hall, Cobrahamsole
Hall at Sheldwich near Faversham for Pounds 275,000. Lane Fox is selling the
half-timbered Manor Farmhouse at Milstead, near Sittingbourne, for Pounds
275,000.
In the old Cinque Port of Deal, Strutt &amp; Parker and Bright &amp; Bright offer
Woodbine, a Georgian house with walled garden and studio, for Pounds
330,000. Cluttons' Canterbury office and Weatherall Green &amp; Smith are
selling Highland Court, at Bridge, a columned stately home, for Pounds
750,000.
The far-sighted are buying now, either side of La Manche. The value in
France is formidable. And it is not bad in Kent.

FT  12 MAR 94 / German union accepts 2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's largest public sector union accepted a pay rise below the rate of
inflation for its 3.5m members yesterday, improving prospects of a round of
low wage increases across the country.
The OTV union accepted a rise of 2 per cent, against inflation projected at
around 3 per cent this year. In addition, civil servants will give up the
traditional 13th month of extra pay at Christmas for the next three years.
The deal, which follows a series of token strikes, was reached after 40
hours of talks in Stuttgart between union negotiators and interior ministry
officials. Within hours of the OTV deal being announced, IG Metall -
Germany's largest union, representing 3.6m engineering workers - secured
agreement from its members for a below-inflation pay increase negotiated by
the leadership last week.
IG Metall workers in the state of Lower Saxony voted overwhelmingly to
accept the deal, which has already been agreed by almost all other union
regions, thus heading off threatened strikes in the engineering sector. The
deal is seen as the benchmark for remaining pay talks this year.
In the public sector agreement, civil servants in lower pay brackets, in
particular in eastern Germany, will receive their rise from July 1, while
middle-ranking and senior officials will be paid at the higher rate two
months later. The deal will run for 15 months starting January 1 1994.
The agreement was accepted overwhelmingly by the OTV union's 210-strong wage
commission, after being recommended by the negotiating team. It includes
greater flexibility for workers taking time off in lieu of overtime.
Meanwhile, IG Medien, the print union, said its members staged a second day
of warning strikes across the country. About 400,000 workers made token
stoppages at about 50 plants, the union said.

FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: Lafarge Coppee rises 26% for
year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Lafarge Coppee, the French construction materials group, yesterday announced
a 26 per cent increase in net profit, to FFr1.55bn (Dollars 267.2m), for
1993. Turnover was slightly lower at FFr30.43bn. It is holdings its net
dividend at FFr9 per share.
The group benefited last year from the return to profit of its American
subsidiary, Lafarge Corporation and from a better return on its investments
in central Europe. These offset the effects of recession in France.
It predicted that the strengthening of its capital base would continue, with
a possible FFr1.3bn increase in shareholder funds from the conversion of
bonds and another FFr1.5bn from exercised share warrants.
As a result, the group said it planned to step up investments this year, to
between FFr5bn and FFr7bn, from FFr5.5bn this year. This was to increase its
presence on particularly promising international markets around the
Mediterranean, Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Mr Bertrand Collomb, president, said the group had been prospecting the
Chinese market, which seemed re-opened to French companies following Paris's
promise to Peking to sell no more offensive arms to Taiwan.

FT  11 MAR 94 / French act over Mafia influx
</HEADLINE>

   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Senior French and Italian magistrates and police yesterday met in the
southern French town of Aix-en-Provence to exchange information on fighting
organised crime.
The French justice ministry played down the significance of the meeting's
timing, planned five months ago. But it comes after last month's
gangster-style assassination of Mrs Yann Piat, a French MP who had crusaded
against corruption in the Var department. Two men are being held by French
police, but dozens of others, including local politicians, have also been
questioned.
According to one theory, Mrs Piat's death was a revenge killing for the
gunning down of a French underworld figure a year ago in Italy.
The two-day meeting in Aix reflects growing concern that the Mafia may be
spreading its activities into southern France, because of lucrative
investment opportunities in casinos and real estate and because it is under
increasing police pressure at home. Leading the Italian side at the Aix
meeting is Mrs Liliana Ferraro, the judge in charge of the Italian
government's fight against the Mafia.
Mr Charles Pasqua, last night campaigning in Nice for a conservative
candidate in Sunday's parliamentary election in the city, has promised to
clean up the Riviera. Last week he was presented with a report recommending
the creation of regional squads specialised in fighting organised crime.

FT  11 MAR 94 / UN chiefs desperate for extra troops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The extra troops promised yesterday by Britain and other countries must be
dispatched to Bosnia as soon as possible, UN officials in Zagreb warned last
night.
They said the troops, which fall short of the 4,600 needed for Sarajevo, the
Bosnian capital, and an extra 6,050 for central Bosnia, are desperately
needed to shore up the fragile ceasefire, reinstate vital services for
several cities, and speed up the deliveries of aid convoys throughout the
country. There are alrady 13,000 troops stationed in the republic.
'The sooner these troops come the better,' said Lieutenant Commander Jean
Marcotte, the UN's army spokesman in Zagreb, the Croatian capital.
In Sarajevo, the troops are needed to implement the ceasefire as well as
finally start de-militarising the capital. In addition, General Sir Michael
Rose, the UN commander in Bosnia, requires a support unit and an engineer
unit of 2,200 men to back up the troops, help rebuild local services, and
start clearing mines.
Elsewhere in Bosnia, General Rose wants additional forces to monitor the
ceasefire, but also help repair roads crucial for sending in aid convoys.
More important, any extra troops will be deployed to new 'safe areas', in
particular the besieged Moslem enclave of Maglaj, which Bosnian Serb forces
continue to bombard, as well as prevent UN aid convoys from delivering
supplies.
No supplies have reached this 20,000-strong enclave for several months.
'You can see the sense of urgency about sending the troops. The forces we
have are already stretched,' a UN official said. 'Also, you must remember
that the British forces in central Bosnia have to patrol a ceasefire line
which is over 300 kilometres long. That requires a lot of manpower.'
In Sarajevo alone, the ceasefire perimeter exceeded at least 200km.
'These lines have to be manned twenty-four hours a day on a three-shift
system. I just hope we can manage with the extra thousand or so which we
will be receiving soon,' a UN official added.
General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, said
earlier this week that about 50,000 troops were needed to oversee any
eventual political settlement for the republic.
Western diplomats in New York said several countries, including Pakistan and
Bangladesh, have already offered troops. But the problem is that they do not
have the equipment. 'Germany and Austria have agreed in principle to equip
them,' a diplomat at the UN headquarters said last night.
Germany, for constitutional reasons cannot send troops outside Nato
territory; neither can Austria for historical reasons and because it is a
neighbouring state.
'The problem with accepting the Pakistani or Bangladeshi offer, however
welcome, is that they will not be ready for deployment until June. Ideally,
we would prefer countries from Nato because they can react quickly and in
many circumstances, share the same command/training structures.'
Yet even once the troops are deployed, the UN is still faced with another
problem: will any troops redeployed from Croatia ever be replaced.
Over 10,000 troops have been stationed in Croatia in UN protected areas,
which Serb forces seized from Croatia during the war in 1991.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Survey of European Property (16): Dizzying descent begins to
slow - It is clear that the worst is finally over for Sweden, although
recovery remains elusive / Sweden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES

<TEXT>
The descent has been dizzying but at last it is beginning to slow. Having
dropped further than most other European property markets during the 1990s,
it is clear that the worst is finally over for Sweden. Recovery, though,
remains elusive, particularly for the commercial property sector. Vacancy
rates are still extremely high and rents, with few exceptions, are
declining.
The continuing oversupply means that the commercial property sector will
only gradually stabilise. But, in contrast to a year ago, at least there are
some encouraging signs.
Yields are falling for the first time since 1989, if only because of lower
interest rates. Companies are not going bankrupt at anything like the rate
that they were, slowing the flow of additional properties onto the market.
And companies and public sector organisations are moving back into central
Stockholm again, after a big exodus to peripheral regions of the city,
helping to push rent levels up slightly.
Some stabilisation is not surprising given that capital values and rental
prices have more than halved in Stockholm since their 1990 peak. In the
centre of the city, rents of SKr1,500-2,000 a sq m are typical, compared
with SKr3,500-4,000 four years ago.
A number of external factors are helping to arrest the decline. They include
a sharp drop in Swedish interest rates since late 1992, gathering evidence
of a general economic recovery and clear signs that the worst of the Swedish
banking crisis is over.
The return of stability to the financial sector has helped to calm the
property market because collapsing real estate values were at the heart of
the Swedish banking crisis, forcing banks to seize hundreds of properties
both at home and abroad after loans to real estate companies went sour.
The melt-down resulted in Swedish financial institutions becoming some of
the country's biggest property owners, threatening to destabilise further an
already unstable situation. In fact the nightmare scenario of banks dumping
properties wholesale onto the market was avoided, thanks to the improvement
in their own fortunes - again, a product of lower interest rates - and the
nature of government intervention.
Generous state support meant 'bad bank' entities such as Securum and Retriva
were well-capitalised, ensuring they did not have to dispose of properties
into a declining market.
'Contrary to what certain people feared, the equivalent of two or three
years' turnover of property stock was prevented from flooding the market,'
says Mr Erik Persson, research and development director with Catella, a
property consulting group.
Those who believe the market is about to turn base their optimism on a
number of factors.
First, the residential market is in a clear recovery phase, thanks to much
lower mortgage rates and a gradual loosening of the rent control system.
Secondly, commercial property yields have begun to fall: having peaked at
between 7 and 8 per cent in 1992-3, they are now below 7 per cent.
Thirdly, property company share prices have begun to outperform the stock
market. Indeed, the strong stock market run suggests it may only be a matter
of time before investors switch some funds out of equities into other areas,
including property.
Finally, foreigners are showing a growing interest in the market, enticed by
low prices and the weak krona. A German pension fund has paid SKr285m for a
large property in northern Stockholm, while an affiliate of Credit Lyonnais,
Altus Nord, has been active in both Stockholm and Gothenburg.
'I expect international buyers will make some large investments before the
summer,' says Mr Jan Wejdmark, managing director of Ljungquist
Fastighetsvarderingar.
Yet reasons for believing that any recovery will be slow are plentiful.
Office vacancies are still rising in most locations and rents are declining.
This is because unemployment continues to climb and companies are using
space more efficiently. In some areas of Stockholm vacancy rates are as high
as 15 to 20 per cent.
'You can see from looking at other international cities that if vacancies
are more than 10 per cent, then rents will normally go down,' says Mr
Wejdmark.
It is also difficult to see who the new breed of property investors will be.
Some of the big players of the late 1980s, such as insurance groups, got
their fingers so badly burned that they are likely to be far more cautious
about investing in property in the future.
Not surprisingly, development activity has shrunk to a fraction of earlier
levels. In Stockholm as little as 30,000-40,000 sq m will be completed
during 1994, compared with as much as 400,000 sq m a year at the market
peak.
Yet with interest rates set to fall further this year, the prospects for
recovery look better today than at any time in the past five years. But the
revival will be slow if only because of the number of properties waiting to
find a new home.
Swedish financial institutions are estimated to have taken over properties
worth between SKr60bn and SKr80bn during the bank crisis. Even this may not
slow the recovery too much, because it is only equivalent to one-two years
of normal turnover.
'If you press down an air-filled ball into the water for long enough, it
will eventually bounce back up again,' says Mr Persson.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Survey of European Property (15): Construction cranes will
be back - Two grand business property developments are good indicators of
what is going on in Madrid's property market / Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Big business property developments tend to have grandiose names and those in
Spain are no exception to the rule.
The Gateway to Europe, at the northern edge of Madrid's central axis, the
broad Castellana boulevard, is one grand example and the Field of Nations,
just beyond the city's limits and close to the airport is another. Both are
good indicators of what has happened, what is happening and what is likely
to happen to the Spanish capital's property market.
The Gateway, which consists of two 46-storey office blocks that lean towards
each other, is better known in Madrid as the KIO towers after the Kuwait
Investment Office whose company, Prima Inmobiliaria, began to build them
when the property market was booming in the late 1980s.
The company, together with the KIO's main Spanish investment arm, went into
receivership in December 1992 and the half-completed Gateway was finally
acquired at a bargain price a year later by a syndicate of domestic
financial groups and by FCC, a leading construction company.
The Field of Nations, a 90,000 sq m business park which includes Madrid's
main trade fair centre, has gradually come on stream in the past four years
and is now up and running and virtually filled up. Recently, an insurance
company, Genesis, which is jointly owned by Metropolitan Life of the US and
by Banco Santander, the leading domestic bank, acquired an 8,000 sq m block
in the park, one of the last available locations.
The acquisition by Genesis appeared to indicate a trend. 'If a bank like
Santander, which knows the market very well, is buying freehold it means
that the office market has bottomed out,' says Mr John Baines, chief
executive of real estate company Healey and Baker in Madrid.
In recent months, Procter and Gamble, Unysis, Bull and the domestic energy
company Cepsa have rented large areas of office space in the Campo. Richard
Ellis, which together with Healey and Baker is a leading player in the
domestic property market, believes that suburbs - and particularly business
parks - stand to gain as companies seek to relocate because of potentially
rising leasehold costs in older city-centre buildings.
The costs could rise sharply for companies with pre-1985 leases which will
be deregulated when a new Urban Leasehold Act comes into force later this
year. The act would have been on the statute book last year but was
postponed when parliament was dissolved and new elections held.
The increased expense will be a distinct change for rental prices have come
down strongly, by as much as 40 per cent in some buildings. Early in 1993,
the supply of offices along the 'prime prime' Castellana boulevard axis
outstripped demand, something which, Richard Ellis points out, 'nobody could
have imagined'.
But then again few expected that the Spanish economy would fall so fast and
so deeply into a recession midway through 1992. The painful shrinkage of the
GDP came to a halt in the third quarter of last year and a moderate but
sustained expansion is in place and will become evident in the second half
of the current year.
On the property market, the cycle appeared to be distinctly changing before
the end of last year. Healey and Baker estimates that vacancy rates along
the Castellana central business area will drop in the course of this year to
a mere 6 per cent and there is a general consensus in the market that office
rents are set to rise.
The ownership troubles that afflicted the Gateway, or the KIO towers, could
consequently have been a blessing in disguise. Work has restarted on the two
blocks after an interval of nearly 18 months and they are likely to be
completed and ready for occupation in the spring of next year - just when
office space demand is expected to be growing strongly.
In Barcelona, where there is less demand for large office locations (the
great majority of corporate headquarters in Spain are in Madrid), demand
will pick up more moderately. Starting rental prices are similar in both
cities but the vacancy rates in Barcelona are appreciably higher than those
in Madrid.
International investors are mostly quiet in the office sector but there is
increasing activity in retail properties and particularly in shopping
centres. The latter have mushroomed all over Spain with good results but
there is room for more growth.
The retail excitement will prod the office sector into activity sooner
rather than later. A key factor in this is that interest rates have come
down fast in Spain over the past eight months and are set to fall further in
the months ahead. Developers can now acquire three-year, medium-term finance
at around 8.5 per cent and it is a sure bet that the big construction
cranes, which used to be such a permanent feature of Spanish city skylines,
will be back.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Survey of European Property (14): Demand runs further ahead
of supply - A new constitution adopted last December enshrines inalienable
private property rights for the first time in post-Soviet history / Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Russia has made strides to strengthen fledgling property rights over the
past year, demand has outstripped the supply of property in Moscow, the
centre of the country's real estate market, by more than ever before.
A new constitution adopted in a referendum last December after President
Boris Yeltsin crushed a parliamentary uprising enshrines inalienable private
property rights for the first time in post-Soviet history. A presidential
decree dating from October - which has yet to be submitted to a parliament
which may reject it - allows for the unhindered sale and purchase of land
except by foreigners, who can only do so in partnership with Russian
companies.
Under the old constitution, the re-sale of land was subject to a 10-15 year
moratorium. As privatisation has gathered pace, there have also been more
opportunities to buy property from owners who have acquired clear title to
it.
But because it is largely due to a shortage of quality space, the increase
in unsatisfied demand has been in spite of, rather than because of, the
progress with legislation.
'There is more order in the system than less. That still does not mean it is
an ordered system, but it means we are vaguely heading in the right
direction,' says Mr Adrian Moore, in charge of property deals at the Moscow
office of solicitors Norton Rose.
Mr Moore says that some of the new property business comes from foreign
companies such as his own which began leasing small amounts of space as 'an
experiment' and then decided to take larger premises as their business
expanded in Moscow.
A lot of the development is generated by new Russian companies and banks
which are more at ease with the system than foreigners. A popular source of
enrichment for underpaid officials has been the bribes paid by businessmen
wishing to acquire property at exceptionally low prices and make a killing
from its subsequent development.
In theory, foreign companies and individuals can own buildings outright.
They can also lease land but not own it except when it is attached to a
privatised enterprise.
But while picking one's way through the labyrinthine Russian bureaucracy in
order to obtain 'good title' is possible and creates good business for
lawyers, western real estate developers say life remains tough.
Apart from the red tape and the background fears that political instability
could one day lead to expropriation, it remains extremely difficult for
developers to raise finance on the strength of Russian property projects.
Mr Moore says the main obstacle is the absence of a system for registering a
lender's legal charge, or his right to realise his security. 'The key thing
any lender is looking for is to register the fact they made the loan and can
take valid security over something like the development'.
Mr Haluk Gercek, in charge of the Moscow office of Enka, the Turkish
construction company which has been able to bring its own funds and bank
finance to Russian projects, believes the main problem is psychological.
After 70 years of communism, Mr Gercek finds that many Russians have only a
faint grasp of such concepts as private property, venture capital and
investment. 'You can't fix this with laws and regulations. It is a matter of
long-term acceptance of property rights and private ownership. People think
they are doing you a favour if they offer you investment opportunities
without offering security for your capital.'
As an example of Russian attitudes to what constitutes an opportunity, he
cites Russian officials who have offered Enka buildings inhabited either by
tenants with rights to the property or illegal squatters.
Still, he believes a presence on the Russian market is essential to benefit
from its future promise. He claims that Enka is now the biggest foreign
contractor on the Russian market, and he says the company's reputation for
getting jobs done faster and more cheaply than the competition helped clinch
it a Dollars 22m contract to help rebuild the White House after it was
shelled by army tanks to quell last October's parliamentary rebellion.
Mosenka, Enka's joint venture with the Moscow city construction authorities,
has been renovating buildings on which it has a 25- to 49-year lease, and
renting them to foreigners. The scarcity of properties mean that office
space in Moscow is among the most expensive in the world, costing Dollars
800-Dollars 900 a sq m a year.
Independently of its Russian joint venture, Enka is presently studying
projects whereby the Moscow city government would give it dilapidated
buildings - which abound in the city - to renovate in return for 50 per cent
ownership of the final product - with no guarantee that this will include
the land beneath the buildings.
'We are proceeding very slowly, with foreign and Russian lawyers so we can
get as much security as possible that this won't be taken away from us
later,' says Mr Gercek.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Survey of European Property (13): Local authorities create
problems - Difficulties with obtaining planning and building permissions are
a significant barrier to development and lead to increased costs / Poland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Warsaw's city centre - which was largely destroyed during the second world
war and later rebuilt - still contains enough empty spaces to warm a
developer's heart. But according to Mr Michael Roskelly of Dauntons Gerald
Eve in Warsaw, the city is littered with building projects many of which are
unlikely to get past the drawing board.
'Lots of schemes are talked about but few have a future,' he says. The
reason is not lack of demand for modern office space from the steady trickle
of foreign companies attracted by Poland's growing economy. Rather, it is
the difficulty of getting all the relevant parts of a project into place,
including the financing, when dealing with local authorities which are
jealous of influence from abroad.
According to Mr Roskelly, Warsaw needs between 60,000 sq m and 70,000 sq m
of new office space a year, much of it priced at rents of Dollars 20 to
Dollars 25 a sq m.
'Banks and financial services companies want prestigious accommodation and
they could fill a couple of buildings,' he says. But larger companies are
now also coming in on tight budgets - and they want to pay the lower rents,
as do a growing number of local companies who are looking for the prestige
of western-style accommodation.
Ms Karolina Kaim from Jones Lang Wootton agrees that there is demand but not
at the top end of the market where companies are now paying up to Dollars 60
a sq m. Although about 60,000 sq m of office space came onto the market in
1993, rents have yet to start moving downwards.
Meanwhile, both Jones Lang Wootton and Dauntons Gerald Eve cite problems
with getting planning and building permissions from local authorities as a
pertinent barrier to development. The local authorities tend not to like
foreign developers so Polish architects and engineers are taken in to
provide projects with a local veneer. But they have yet to learn to
appreciate fully the commercial aspects of a project or the needs of a
western institutional client.
All this increases the soft costs which have to be incurred before planning
permission can be obtained and financing arranged.
There are also still problems with land title and the issue is especially
acute in Warsaw where owners of the ruined city were dispossessed en bloc
after the war. Successive governments have promised to resolve the problem
of restitution but a law dealing with the subject has yet to be passed by
parliament.
Nevertheless, two projects are under construction. There is the 15,000 sq m
FIM tower being built near the five-year-old LIM centre which houses 20,000
sq m of office space and the Marriott Hotel and which will soon become the
first office block to have paid for itself. And there is also the Aktyn
Business Centre, being built by Ilbau which will provide 17,000 sq m of
which 8,000 sq m will be devoted to offices.
Preliminary work has also started on two more buildings. One is the PKO BP's
business centre; the other is the Atrium, 80,000 sq m of office and retail
space which is a joint venture between the Swedish Skanska company and the
Wola district in the Polish capital.
As for hotels, a spate of building activity in the past three years has
provided a temporary surfeit of rooms at the top end of the market. Indeed,
Warsaw has enough four- and five-star hotels and now needs some well-located
three-star accommodation, according to the experts.
The Forte's Bristol Hotel, with its 207 rooms refurbished at a cost of about
Dollars 40m, is struggling to service its debt as occupancy last year
oscillated around the 50 per cent mark. Other recently-constructed hotels
include the French-run Mercure and the colourful Sobieski whose lack of air
conditioning makes it difficult to attract clients in the summer.
Shopping projects remain an underdeveloped sector of the market with the
Polish planned and built white and blue Panorama building on the route out
to the Ursynow high-rise dormitory district the only very big development in
the past five years. The building is successful and still awaits competition
from other retailing projects.
Ikea, the Swedish furniture retailer, has a big shop on the outskirts of the
city and Makro, a Dutch wholesaler, has also had the Exbud construction
company build a large cash and carry development in a Warsaw suburb.
But in the main, foreign companies have been less adventurous, with the
Austrian Billa group, for example, putting its two supermarkets into a
disused factory building and a bus depot.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Survey of European Property (12): Massive demand for retail
space - In contrast, the market for central Lisbon office space is suffering
from the effects of substantial oversupply / Portugal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A striking new retail and residential centre is rising out of the ashes of
the fire that destroyed the heart of Lisbon's historic Chiado shopping
district in 1988. But it will only go a short way towards meeting the
massive demand for retail space that is currently dominating the Portuguese
property market.
Big international retailers such as Hard Rock Cafe, Virgin Records and
British Home Stores are poised to move into Portugal while established
foreign chains including McDonald's, Pizza Hut and the Spanish fashion store
Zara are expanding aggressively.
The result is that demand for prime retail sites far outstrips supply. New
rents for shops in the central Avenida da Liberdade or Chiado areas have
reached Es15,000 a sq m a month; more than three times the prices paid in
the relatively depressed office market, where supply exceeds demand.
The new Chiado development, conceived by Mr Alvaro Siza Vieira, Portugal's
most respected architect, in a style reminiscent of the original 18th
century buildings, is due to be largely completed by the end of 1995, and
will absorb only a small part of this demand. Many of the original retailers
will be entitled to reoccupy the area, with the result that only a few new
sites will come onto the market.
It will be comprised of 30 per cent office space, 30 per cent retail and 40
per cent residential. The aim in building residential apartments is to bring
new life to the city centre. Almost no one lives there at present and the
area becomes a deserted shell as soon as shops and offices close - a factor
that partly explains why the fire was already out of control before the
alarm was raised.
'Lisbon still lacks quality new shops,' says Mr George Craven, director of
Lisbon-based Sofica Savills. 'Buildings in the Chiado reconstruction are now
being completed but they stand against part-finished structures and work yet
to be begun, leaving retailers who are being asked prime rents nervous about
returning to the area.'
However, three other important developments will relieve the pressure for
retail sites over the next few years. 'The Colombus Centre, a mixed
development in the Benfica suburb of Lisbon, will place 133,000 sq m of
shopping space on the market by 1997,' says Mr Eric van Leuven, managing
director in Portugal of Healey &amp; Baker, 'laying claim to being one of the
biggest shopping centres in Europe.'
El Corte Ingles, the Spanish department store, will take up a 30,000 sq m
anchor store in a development to be built around a new Hilton Hotel
alongside Lisbon's Eduardo VII park by 1997.
An additional 20,000 sq m will be made available for smaller shops. In the
town of Oeiras, a few miles from Lisbon, a 40,000 sq m shopping centre with
its own important catchment area should be ready by early 1996.
In contrast to the buoyant retail sector, the market for central Lisbon
office space is suffering from the effects of substantial oversupply. Rents
have fallen about 35 per cent over the past two years to a current level of
Es4,500 sq m.
Demand is strong, with an annual take-up of some 60,000 sq m that has
remained steady over the past five years. But the vacancy rate is about 6
per cent, with 100,000 sq m of new office space and 50,000 sq m of
secondhand offices unoccupied in Lisbon. This rate compares favourably with
cities such as Madrid, Paris or London but is a symptom of growing
difficulties in Lisbon where there have been no vacancies at all in recent
years.
Another 75,000 sq m of new office space is expected to come onto the Lisbon
market in 1994 and the level of new building is unlikely to diminish over
the next few years. This will push up vacancy rates, increase oversupply and
hold down rents.
Because new rents are falling closer to the level of older rents, many
companies are moving out of dilapidated, inefficient buildings in the centre
of Lisbon into more modern developments. The clear choice of multinationals
is for out-of-town or edge-of-town business parks where new rents are
currently about Es4,100 and conditions including traffic and parking are
more attractive.
'Some companies that took up offices in the late 1980s, when rents were at
their peak, are also keen to move,' says Mr van Leuven. 'Under Portuguese
law, rents rise with inflation. These companies may now be paying Es8,000 sq
m when they could rent new premises for almost half that.'
A crucial factor in stimulating Portugal's underdeveloped investment market
will be the approval of a new commercial lease law. The current law provides
tenants with perpetual security of tenure without any open-market rent
reviews. The new law will provide for fixed-term contracts after which rents
can be renegotiated at market rates. The legislation could be approved
within the next few months - a promise that the authorities have been making
since 1987.

improve - Bargain hunters can find good quality office space at some of the
lowest prices in Europe / Austria

The Vienna property market is not out of the doldrums yet, but there are
signs that rental prices may have reached bottom and that investment is
destined to pick up because the scarcity of new developments could lead to
under-supply of office space within a couple of years.
For the time being however, bargain hunters can find good quality office
space at some of the lowest prices in Europe ranging from Sch280 a sq m for
top development in prime sites, to Sch120-Sch160 a sq m elsewhere.
Rents declined sharply after almost doubling between 1987 and 1992 during a
speculative boom encouraged by the prospect - now abandoned - of a joint
world expo with Budapest in 1995. Last year alone, prime rents fell by about
11 per cent. As a result, office space in Vienna is now cheaper than in
Prague or Budapest, which goes to explain why so many companies are looking
to Vienna again as a location for their central and eastern European
headquarters.
'There are many constraints on the market, but things are improving, and
we're seeing an increasing number of international companies setting up
here,' says Mr Alan Vincent from real estate consultants Richard Ellis.
Companies that have chosen Vienna as a regional base include McDonald's,
IBM, Hewlett Packard, Alcatel, American Express, Gillette,
Colgate-Palmolive, Pepsico and Nomura.
Vienna's offers a good supply of western standard office space at reasonable
rents, it has efficient telecommunications, a good transport infrastructure,
a clean and attractive environment, and a high quality of life, says Mr
Vincent.
As Budapest, Prague and Warsaw develop, there may be less incentive to go to
Vienna as more companies may chose to base themselves directly in those
cities. But 'many western companies have already been disillusioned by the
slow pace of improvement of their transport, infrastructure and
telecommunications, as well as the generally poor environment,' a Richard
Ellis report argues.
Vienna, it says, is likely to remain a regional centre for Austria, Hungary,
and the Czech and Slovak republics for the medium term.
Which should be good news for investors and developers who found Vienna a
difficult market to enter. 'Owner occupation in Vienna stands at around 80
per cent with the market dominated by banks and insurance companies, which
in turn own property development and construction companies,' says a report
by John Lang Wootton.
'People here tend to hold on to their property, and that makes for a very
illiquid market,' says Mr Vincent.
The residential market also continues to suffer from rent and tenancy
controls that give almost unlimited security of tenure to occupiers. Agents
say recently-approved legislation has made matters worse by further
strengthening protection for tenants. 'Landlords have no incentive to
maintain their property in Vienna, and this could lead to some serious
degradation as a result of neglect in a few years' time,' says one agent.
Meanwhile several projects have recently been completed or will be completed
shortly, with a few large developments in the pipeline. Supply has exceeded
demand since 1991, leading to a vacancy rate of about 5 per cent today,
although agents say this is not high by international comparison. With
demand for office space averaging about 130,000 sq m a year, supply peaked
at 290,00 sq m in 1993 and is expected to fall to 150,000 sq m this year,
and 80,000 sq m in 1995.
In and near the city centre there are several important developments ranging
in size from a 7,000 sq m office building recently completed by Groupe
Pierre 1er of France, to a planned 80,000 sq m of offices, apartments and
shops at Wien Mitte in a project originally led by Sweden's SPP. LET, but
taken over by Bank Austria and domestic partners after SPP. LET sold out.
Further out from the centre, developments range from the huge Donau-City
project with a planned 470,000 sq m of offices, apartments, shops, and a big
hotel, in the north-east of the city, to the 37,000 sq m Concorde Business
Park, Vienna's only purpose-built business park, on the road to the airport.
Four office developments, two of which have already been completed and let,
totalling 160,000 sq m are planned along Lasallestrasse, on the main
north-east axis out of Vienna; and Business Park Vienna, a 60,000 sq m
development with offices and a hotel in the south of the city.
The Donau-City project dwarfs all others by its size and its ambition to
become Vienna's second city centre. The first phase of construction
representing about 40 per cent of the total development including all basic
infrastructure and some 70,000 sq m of residential, office and commercial
space is expected to be completed in 1997. The rest of the development will
be completed at a more leisurely pace 'depending on market demand' an
official said.
Outside Vienna, the market is small, with some activity in Graz and Linz,
although local restrictions - especially in Salzburg and in the Tyrol - make
it very difficult for foreign investors.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Survey of European Property (11): Economic downturn catches
up - Brussels is suffering from the same problems that have afflicted other
European markets / Belgium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until recently, the resilience of the Brussels property market has made it
the envy of many of its recession-hit neighbours.
The European Union, which together with the Belgian government occupies some
60 per cent of Brussels' offices, appeared to insulate the Brussels market
from the effects of the European economic downturn.
No longer. Brussels is now suffering from the same problems of reduced
demand and rising vacancy rates that have afflicted other European markets.
The cost of renting space declined last year, marking the end of a period of
continuous rental growth since 1980.
The extent of this downturn took some observers by surprise. 'We had hoped
that Brussels would not be hit too much because of the EU's presence,' says
Mr Philippe Winssinger of DTZ Winssinger, property advisers. 'In fact, the
recession has been worse than we anticipated as a result of a lot of
domestic companies cutting back on their need for space and multinationals
reducing the size of their Brussels operation.'
Office vacancy rates stand at about 8 per cent, compared with a low of about
3 per cent in 1989. On the face of it, demand for office space remained at a
high level, with about 300,000 sq m being let or sold to occupiers. However,
a large proportion of that was accounted for by a single deal, namely
Belgacom's acquisition of the 110,000 sq m Tour Pleiad. In addition, the EU
accounted for about 15 per cent of the total take-up.
Many of the remaining occupiers have shed staff and reduced their
requirements for space. 'It is now far more common for demand for space to
originate from groups looking to move to smaller offices than those
contemplating an increase in their occupation,' says Richard Ellis,
chartered surveyors.
There are marked variations in the state of the letting market, according to
the location, quality and age of building.
The brunt of the increase in vacancy rates has affected the city centre and
Leopold district (the main EU and financial area), where rents have fallen
by 15-20 per cent.
By contrast, the office market in the periphery of Brussels has been more
stable. It has benefited from companies leaving the centre of Brussels to
escape traffic congestion and increased local taxes. A new office tax
introduced in Brussels in 1989 increased the tax burden on office occupiers
by about 20 per cent, which is enough to offset the benefits of lower rents.
A widening gap is also opening up between new and old offices, where the
rental differential is some 10-15 per cent. The decline in rents is likely
to stop in the near future in new buildings because they will be taken up in
preference to older buildings, in the view of Mr Michel Pilette of Jones
Lang Wootton. He estimates that three quarters of the new space, which
currently accounts for a third of the available stock, will be let by the
end of the year.
In older buildings, however, rents are likely to continue to decline,
particularly as investors are proving reluctant to spend money on
refurbishment.
Some factors, however, encourage confidence that the letting market will
revive. Although EU budgets are currently constrained, its requirement for
offices is likely to grow as it embraces new members.
Moreover, there is little new property coming onto the market. The current
speculative development programme will add just 137,000 sq m of space - less
than 2 per cent - to the total office stock, according to Richard Ellis. The
city's tight planning controls will ensure that the future supply of new
stock is constrained.
Despite the current travails of the letting market, there has been a marked
improvement in the investment market. This was stimulated by the decline in
interest rates, which pushed the cost of money below property yields in many
cases.
Total investment was close to a record of BFr28-30bn last year, compared
with BFr15-18bn in the previous year. Private Belgian investors have been
important players in the market, through securitisation, which offers tax
advantages. Two such Belgian Real Estate Certificates were sold last year:
one for 37,000 sq m in the Green Belt for BFr5.3bn on a yield of 7.5 per
cent and one in the Avenue Marcel Thiry for 10,000 sq m of offices for
BFr1.06bn, on a yield of 7.6 per cent.
At present, investors remain cautious as they confine their interest to
high-quality buildings which are less than 15 years old, with good leases.
But the return of investors to the market is likely to gather momentum,
believes Mr Winssinger. 'We are at a stage where the UK was a year ago, with
high yields, low rents and low cost of money. A year ago, there was a lot of
product but limited buyers. Now that has reversed,' he says.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Survey of European Property (9): More resilient than most -
There was a marked pick-up in demand for good quality buildings in the
second half of 1993, after two sluggish years / The Netherlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The recession has dealt lightly with the Dutch property market. While it has
not escaped entirely from rising vacancy rates, stagnating rents and
sluggish investment markets, it has remained more stable than most of its
continental European counterparts.
This resilience can, in part, be attributed to the decentralised structure
of the Dutch property market. Dutch businesses are scattered throughout the
principle Netherlands cities of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, the Hague and Utrecht.
As a result, rents are rarely driven up by the pressure of demand, and
therefore Dutch property rental values tend to be lower and more stable that
other European cities.
Another factor influencing the stability of the market is the dominant role
played by institutions. This means that property is usually funded with
equity, rather than bank finance.
As a result, there is little pressure on property owners to sell property
during the trough of a cycle. 'In a downturn, there is the appearance of a
stable market,' says Mr Glen Cowan of Jones Lang Wootton, property advisers.
'There is no distressed selling.'
Many property owners are hoping that the downturn is over as far as the
investment market is concerned. There was a marked pick-up in demand for
good quality buildings in the second half of 1993, after two sluggish years.
The upturn was particularly pronounced in the retail sector, which accounted
for almost 60 per cent of the Fl2.2bn invested in property last year.
As interest rates fell, the high initial yields available on property have
begun to look more attractive.
The improvement in the investment market has not embraced poorer-quality
buildings, for which yields have increased by about one percentage point.
However, fully let, well-located buildings in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, the
Hague and Utrecht are in demand; yields have dropped by between a quarter
and a half of a percentage point.
In the largest single office investment deal ever done in Amsterdam, MBO,
development arm of Internationale Nederlanden Group, sold its 34,000 sq m
Atrium building in Amsterdam South to Zurich Life Insurance on a yield of
under 6.5 per cent.
The fortunes of the occupational market are generally less encouraging,
although they vary markedly from sector to sector.
The retail market has been relatively robust in 1993, with vacancy rates of
just 1-2 per cent. Some prime units which were let between 1989 and 1992 may
now be slightly over-rented as a result of a slight decline in consumer
spending, according to Richard Ellis. But shopping centres with strong
anchor tenants and individual secondary retail units are continuing to
experience some rental growth.
The strength of the retail property market has prompted developers to draw
up plans for a significant number of new shopping centres. These proposals
add about 300,000 sq m of retail space to the pipeline, bringing the
projected development total to about 1m sq m.
In the industrial sector, the economic downturn resulted in a 15 per cent
drop in institutional demand, according to DTZ. Despite this, small modern
industrial units are in short supply; most of the surplus space is in
relatively large, industrial complexes. Overall, rents remained stable last
year.
In the office market there is, on the face of it, little cause for concern.
Last year, demand for offices rose sharply to a record 1.37m sq m across the
Netherlands, according to DTZ Zadelhoff.
In part, this was because government agencies agreed to let 530,000 sq m of
space, which partly resulted from a government decision to relocate many of
the judicial authorities. Most parts of the country registered higher demand
in 1993, but Amsterdam proved to be the most popular office location with
take-up reaching some 200,000 sq m.
However, these strong take-up figures mask the fact that tenants are
relinquishing space when they move into new buildings. With hardly any net
absorption of office space, the availability of space rose by 8 per cent to
stand at 2.7m sq m. Agents expect vacancy rates to remain high this year, as
companies announce cut-backs in staffing levels.
As a result there has been pressure on rents. Rents on space in some of the
most expensive offices in southern Amsterdam have fallen by 5-10 per cent.
Elsewhere, the pressure from rising vacancy rates has forced landlords to
make larger concessions in the form of rent-free periods and other
incentives. Although the supply of new space coming on the market has
fallen, agents do not expect rents to grow in real terms this year. Hopes
are pinned on an improvement in the economy, coupled with a reduction in
available space, which could result in a pick-up in rental growth next year.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Survey of European Property (8): Rome and Milan are poles
apart - With 1m sq m taken by government and other public sector occupants,
the capital's property market is less sensitive to recession / Italy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few were surprised when leading Italian bankers were arrested last month,
and real estate operations became the subject of an investigation by the
mani pulite (clean hands) magistrates' team. The surprise was that the
magistrates took so long in making the connection. Politics and property
find their nexus in banks, particularly where top bankers are politicians'
appointees.
The arrests took place at a difficult time for the property sector, already
hard-pressed by the effects of recession. Bricks and mortar had enjoyed a
solid reputation in Italy as zero-risk investment, but this is changing.
'Banks are having to decide how to deal with shaky construction companies.
They now seem more prudent and readier to turn off the cash tap. There have
not yet been clamorous cases of company failure, but the problem is growing
and banks are finding themselves with unwanted property portfolios,' says a
manager with a leading Rome real estate agency.
Property values divide borrowers and lenders, the sharp drop in prices since
the beginning of the 1990s lying behind the increasing concern about loans
secured against real estate collateral. Prices of office accommodation have
fallen by as much as 50 per cent in the capital, albeit weakening less in
the best locations.
This is reflected in rents which are now significantly lower in money terms
than two years ago. 'They have declined from a maximum of L750,000 to
L650,000 a sq m a year for good quality offices in prime locations in the
historic centre,' says Mr Roberto Trella, managing director of Richard Ellis
SpA, the British company's Italian subsidiary.
Strict planning constraints mean that supply is virtually static in Rome's
centre. Vacancy rates of around 5 per cent are half those recorded in the
outskirts.
Ministries and public bodies are important in Rome's market. This may
explain the generally low standard of properties. 'Most of recent
construction has been speculative. Buildings are not highly specified and
are generally not satisfactory for international users,' says Mr Trella.
With about 1m sq m of the 6m sq m total within Rome's GRA ring road taken by
government and other public sector occupants, the capital's property market
is less sensitive to the recession than elsewhere.
Indeed, the figures show that recession and other adverse factors have
bitten deeper in Milan, the other pole in what is essentially a bi-polar
Italian market. 'Milan's office stock amounts to about 8.5m sq m. Vacancy
rates are now between 8 and 10 per cent in the centre and between 20 and 25
per cent in the outskirts,' says Mr Trella.
Milan's property bubble, in which rents and capital values rose by 300 per
cent between 1985 and 1990, burst before the more gentle deflation started
in the capital. The peak was reached at the end of 1990, anticipating the
recession's onset, and arriving more than two years before the mani pulite
magistrates made their first public moves. Mr Trella says: 'Annual rents for
prime city centre accommodation are now below L550,000 a sq m, against
L750,000 three years ago.'
Nevertheless, strict planning policies, favouring residential use and
preventing the construction of new buildings in Milan's centre, give a firm
base to the property market. And as the country's business capital, with its
stock market, leading domestic financial institutions and the head offices
of leading industrial companies, Milan is the natural location choice for
foreign companies setting foot in Italy.
At the centre of the country's principal manufacturing areas, Milan is also
close to the country's important trading partners, and enjoys good transport
connections to the outside. And unlike Rome, which suffers from very poor
services, Milan has reasonable public transport. With these positive
features, it is difficult to envisage the demand for business accommodation
shifting from Milan to other Italian cities.
'Yet Milan does nothing to promote itself,' remarks Mr Paul Bacon, partner
at Healey &amp; Baker's Milan office. Whereas other big business centres
actively seek to attract newcomers, the Lombardy capital does not push
itself.
In addition to its innately strong position, perhaps another reason is the
shortage of good property. 'There is a lack of quality in the market. Even
in the centre, most property is of poor quality. Inadequate lifts are
normal, and almost two thirds of buildings do not have air conditioning
systems,' says Mr Bacon.
He considers, however, that opportunities exist for foreign investors.
'Companies have been downsizing during the recession, and searching for cost
saving by reducing office requirements and relocating from the centre to the
outskirts. This has created investment opportunities.'
'Prices have dropped by between 30 and 35 per cent from their peaks, and
Milan is now looking cheap compared to other cities,' observes Mr Bacon,
adding that yields have risen from 5 per cent to 6.5 per cent. This is an
attractive factor for north European investors seeking income flow.
'Italian investors tend to buy for capital growth. Discouraged by political
uncertainty and falling prices, they have been absent from the market since
the end of 1992.' Mr Bacon expects that the property markets in Rome and
Milan will become more like those in other leading European cities, with a
greater presence of international investors. He also believes that Italian
institutions will align themselves with international practices.
'We are likely to see change in three areas. First, legislation will lead to
the creation of property funds. Second, Italian insurance companies will
give greater emphasis to yields. Third, Italian banks will become more
aggressive, and the average loan ratio will increase from 50 to 70 per
cent,' predicts Mr Bacon.
And when will the market turn up? Political and economic factors will
decide. The uncertainty that clouds Italian politics will probably not be
cleared by the parliamentary elections at the end of March, and an upturn in
the economy does not seem imminent. Few would wager that the bottom has been
reached in the property market.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Survey of European Property (7): Back to life after
near-death experience - Things are picking up as institutional investors
start to buy properties again / Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGELA LONG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The investment property scene in Ireland is coming back to life after a
prolonged near-death experience in 1993.
Britain's withdrawal from the ERM in September 1992, and the devaluation of
the Irish punt which inevitably followed - despite Dublin's best efforts to
stave it off - in January last year, gave a sharp shock to the market which
was already heading for the doldrums because of the international recession.
As interest rates soared on cash deposits, property looked less and less
attractive. Now, however, rates have plummeted and stabilised. A reasonable
commercial investment in Dublin should see a return of around 10 per cent,
and so things are picking up as institutional investors start to buy
properties again.
In the domestic sector, the signs of revival which estate agents have been
predicting for a year are at last peeping through. However, the hottest
potato in this sector at present is the lowering of the value threshold at
which private residences become liable for residential property tax. In the
January budget, the threshold of liability for this tax, to be paid
annually, fell from a house value of Pounds 91,000 to Pounds 75,000.
There is less contention in the recovering commercial sector. Commercial
property investments appear promising and could rise by 10 per cent over the
next six months, according to Property Outlook, produced by the agency
Hamilton Osborne King. HOK, reflecting that 60 per cent of the Pounds 60m of
prime investment properties which changed hands in 1993 were sold in the
last three months of the year, saw this as an indication that momentum was
gathering in this area.
Quality retail space is being sought eagerly. Mr Bill Phelan, principal in
leading property consultant The Phelan Partnership, says a number of British
retailers are 'desperate' to find space in Grafton Street, Dublin's
up-market shopping precinct and the associated pedestrianised area that
leads from Trinity College up to the business end of Dublin around the
charming park called St Stephen's Green.
Rents there have been around Pounds 140-Pounds 150 a sq ft, but Gunne, one
of the Republic's big four estate agencies, reported recently that it had
let 32 Grafton Street on a 35-year lease at a rate of Pounds 165 a sq ft,
indicating the clear supremacy of this location over other prime shopping
streets such as Henry Street and Mary Street, a few minutes' walk away on
the north side of the River Liffey.
Mr Phelan is not overly impressed by glossy new office developments such as
George's Quay on the reclaimed stretch of quayside by the River Liffey,
opposite the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) complex. 'They
are, and always will be, secondary locations,' he says.
Mr Des Lennon is a partner at Jones Lang Wootton, which employs 65 people in
Dublin, its only Irish office. He agrees that, after the dire straits of
1992-1993, the main problem the Irish market has to handle now is a lack of
good property for the cash-rich investor.
However, about 1.4m sq ft of vacant space indicates that the office market
is depressed. The figure represents about 11 per cent of the entire space
available in Dublin and is a historically high figure, says Mr Lennon.
'Three or four years ago, the comparable figure would have been 5 per cent.
Still, it is not bad in the European context when you consider London had a
vacancy rate of 20 per cent last year.'
Much of the recent development of property in older parts of Dublin, and
some selected sites in other cities, was undertaken to take advantage of tax
incentives introduced in the late 1980s with Section 23 of the Finance Act.
These are for residential buildings in so-called Urban Renewal Development
Areas and include: no property taxes (rates) for 10 years; a double rent
allowance for landlords; and a capital allowance, whereby an investor or
occupier can offset the entire purchase of a building against profits.
These inducements were originally due to expire in February 1993 but there
was so much activity that the government extended the deadline several
times. For special exceptions such as the Customs House area, down-river
from O'Connell Bridge, the cut-off is not until 1997. Since 1988, when this
round of Section 23 tax breaks was introduced, Pounds 966m of private sector
investment has been generated by the urban renewal schemes.
A host of developers is building inner city apartments in Dublin, and these
have been selling rapidly. Temple Bar, only a few minutes' walk from Grafton
Street, has seen much activity in the 1990s and is earmarked for Pounds 334m
in further spending from the government and European Union funds.
Retail is strong in the Republic's secondary cities, with Longford town,
Galway and Cork all seeing new supermarkets and shopping complexes opening
or under construction. Cruises Street, in the heart of Limerick, has been a
big success as a regeneration project, with a quaint 'olde' look and a
number of strong retailers.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Survey of European Property (6): Business mood has settled
down - Supply is easing into a rough balance with demand. The new buzzword
is 'equilibrium' / Hungary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Budapest property analysts, when they reach for a description of the local
market for office space, have to work their tongues around an unfamiliar
word: 'equilibrium.'
The international companies which crammed into hastily converted apartments
at the start of the decade are now generally installed, more or less
contentedly, in modern offices. The business mood, after swinging first to
euphoria and then to disappointment, has settled down  - and with it the
take-up for new rental space, steady at about 45,000 sq m a year.
Development, too, has come through its own, lagging, cycle. Budapest had a
dearth of office stock until 1991. 'There was not a single good building
since the second world war. Look around: they are all terrible,' says Mr
Christopher Bennett, head of Price Waterhouse's property department in
Budapest.
Then came a surplus as projects begun in the glory days belatedly reached
the end of the development pipeline. But now supply is easing into rough
balance with demand. Debenham Thorpe Zadelhoff, the property advisers,
estimates that 126,000 sq m of space is under construction or likely to be
built over the next three years.
Rents for prime space reflect this balance: after leaping to DM55 a sq m at
the start of 1992, rates have stabilised at around DM45-DM50. Forecasts for
rates in 1994 range from flat to a slight firming in the second half of the
year.
Budapest's relative sobriety owes less, however, to clear thinking on the
part of developers and more to the practical difficulties in obtaining
appropriate sites and getting projects off the ground.
Prices for sites have been sticky, rather than stable, because their
Hungarian owners often have a rather rigid view of value. Wide divergence
between asking and offer prices remains common. Mr Bennett knows of one
building where the asking price is three times the Price Waterhouse
valuation.
Nor will equilibrium necessarily endure. Domestic companies only occupy a
tenth of Budapest's office area and their financial recovery would overwhelm
existing provision. Hungary's capital is the largest city between Germany
and the former Soviet Union with 2m inhabitants but has the office stock -
225,000 sq m - of a Bristol.
Imperfect and immature it may be, but Budapest's property market at least
functions. Quality and location, for example, now have an impact on rents
which used to be more or less standard across the city. Maculan's
development on Vaci road, leading north out of Budapest, is letting at a
discount - at about DM35 a sq m.
An investment market is coming into existence. Long-term funds are beginning
to buy developments off the banks, mainly Austrian, which financed them. The
process has been slow and yields remain high at about 13-14 per cent. 'They
(the investors) are all sheep and it is very difficult to get the first
sheep into the dip,' says Mr Bennett. But three important transactions took
place in 1993 and Price Waterhouse forecasts a further 10 this year.
Convergence of yields with west European levels offers the promise of a
one-off capital gain for early buyers.
The impending sale of the East-West Centre, Budapest's most successful
development, will set a benchmark. The property, developed by Skanska of
Sweden, is on the market at DM108m, implying a yield of about 11 per cent,
and expected to go to a German or Dutch fund.
Geography enhances Budapest's attractions to a property investor. Budapest,
in contrast with Berlin and Warsaw, has a clear centre around Deak Square,
defined by the river and transport intersections. Analysts believe
properties in this prime area will always command firm rents and provide a
secure return for investors.
Fotex, Hungary's largest home-grown private business, has developed a
building at the foot of the residential Buda hills. But the most ambitious
project to shift Budapest's centre of gravity, the 1996 Expo, has failed
dismally to attract interest from developers.
While Budapest's market for offices is taking shape, that for retail and
distribution space remains disappointingly formless to observers. The
'berleti jog,' a unique Hungarian institution, something between an endless
lease and a rental agreement, stifles the retail market.
Western retailers have often gone into joint ventures with existing tenants
rather than buying them out, because a change in occupancy is cause for the
owner, usually the local authority, to raise the rent. Rents have in
practice remained low but the lack of clear rules about renegotiation makes
the value of a berleti jog very subjective.
Less easy to explain is the lack of warehouse space. As continuity of supply
becomes more important, so does depth of stock, and the availability of
modern, well-located warehouse space. But there is precious little.
Mr Durrant, blaming obstinate local authorities, says: 'It is impossible to
find a decent-sized concrete box anywhere around Budapest.' A customer for
an office, not a shed, might have made that comment five years ago. That is
the measure of Budapest's progress.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Survey of European Property (5): Sharp differences between
regions - Research by a property consultant found that the main commercial
centres suffered a much more severe recession than the middle-ranking cities
/ Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Germany's worst recession since the second world war has caught up with the
country's highly regionalised commercial property market. Rents fell across
the board last year and there is a growing volume of empty space as building
projects commissioned before the downturn come onto the market.
According to Muller International Immobilien, a German commercial property
consultant, average rents for prime office space dropped from DM51 a sq m to
DM45 a sq m over 1993, a fall of about 12 per cent. The volume of unoccupied
property surged in Germany's 12 leading cities from 1.4m sq m in 1992 to
2.4m sq m in 1993; up more than 70 per cent.
The data conceal sharp regional differences. Muller found that Germany's
main commercial centres suffered a much more severe recession than the
middle-ranking cities. For example, the volume of space let in Cologne and
Hanover was at exactly the same level in 1993 as in 1992 while in Dresden
and Leipzig, coupled with Essen in the Ruhr area of northern Germany, there
was a sharp increase in volume of space rented out.
'These three cities all represent 'young office' markets at an early stage
of development,' Muller comments. In the east German cities, the market also
benefited from a high level of pent-up demand, although this was not enough
to stop a 17 per cent fall in rents in Leipzig.
The picture for the more highly developed office markets in Dusseldorf,
Frankfurt, Hamburg and Munich was much worse. Rentals fell by 29 per cent in
Munich and 24 per cent in Berlin while the volume of space let fell by a
dismal 49 per cent.
Another negative factor was the surge in unoccupied space which in the 12
cities surveyed by Muller climbed from 1.4m sq m in 1992 to 2.4m sq m in
1993. Add in a slight increase in the volume of space under construction, to
5.2m sq m, and the volume of available space after pre-lettings and
owner-occupation rose to a record 6.7m sq m - 4 1/2 times the level of space
let last year.
In Frankfurt, which retained its position as Germany's leading office
property market in terms of rentals levels and volume of space let, the
volume of unoccupied space has surged in the past two years. Including
peripheral locations and offices under construction, the volume of
unoccupied space in Frankfurt stands at 1.3m sq m; five times the 250,000 sq
m let last year. Up until the 1991 building boom, unoccupied space had for
years averaged a modest 150,000 sq m.
Notwithstanding the space overhang, the future of the Frankfurt market is
far from bleak. The decision to site the future European Central Bank in
Frankfurt will consolidate the city's role as continental Europe's leading
financial centre. Independent of this decision, foreign banks have steadily
devoted greater resources to the German market.
It is the international flavour of the Frankfurt office market, with demand
dictated to a large extent by foreign financial institutions, which has
driven the fall in rentals in the city. Last year, the highest rent achieved
was DM75 a sq m, a long way from the near-DM100 a sq m levels of 1991-92.
When the world economy recovers it is to be expected that foreign
institutions will continue to upgrade their commitment to Finanzplatz
Germany - Germany as a financial centre - to Frankfurt's advantage.
In other cities, the property downturn was triggered more by the domestic
recession. Munich was the worst hit, reflecting the impact of the recession
on sectors such as electrical engineering, computer technology, aerospace
and vehicle manufacture, all strongly represented in the Bavarian capital.
Berlin has also suffered as a result of the recession, but the political
doubts hanging over the city's future - another negative for the office
property market - have to some extent been lifted by the German parliament's
reaffirmation that Berlin will become reunited Germany's capital by the end
of the decade.
With the German economy making at best a slow recovery in 1994-95 - and at
worst entering into the second stage of a 'double-dip' recession  - the
German office property market is set for further consolidation.
An underpinning of the market is, however, likely to come from international
investors looking for bargains and from the domestic open-ended property
funds, a form of investment vehicle which has proved highly popular with
individual investors over the past year.
According to Mr Oscar Kienzle, head of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley's German
operations, there is DM10bn invested in the funds, pent-up demand equivalent
to half a year's normal purchasing activity. This money must, by law, be
invested in property, and is likely to provide healthy liquidity support for
the German market.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Survey of European Property (4): Residential sector leads -
Commercial property is generally still in the doldrums although there are
some exceptions / France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the French finance ministry fled from its opulent offices in the Louvre
Museum in central Paris to its glacial new headquarters at Bercy, it also
abandoned a 19th century office building on a prime site on nearby rue
Saint-Honore which was immediately earmarked for sale.
Four years later, the building is still empty. The government has decided to
leave it vacant until the Paris property market picks up rather than risk
selling it now at a depressed price and thereby adding to the existing
pressures on commercial property prices in the city centre.
The government's decision might have been different had the building been
suitable for residential use. Commercial property is still in the doldrums
in France, but there have in recent months been signs of recovery in the
residential sphere. The French property business is now anxiously waiting to
see whether the pick-up in the residential market will spread to the
commercial sector, thereby marking the end of three gruelling years of
recession.
Almost every area of the French economy has been bruised by recession over
the past year, yet few sectors have been as badly affected as property. The
market peaked in 1990 when prices soared and the supply of new buildings,
particularly office space in the Golden Triangle and La Defense districts in
Paris and the Part-Dieu area of Lyon, increased dramatically.
But the market collapsed when the economy came under pressure in the early
1990s. The high rate of French real interest rates, which have for the past
few years been among the steepest in Europe, prompted companies to cut back
on investment and consumers to save, rather than spend, their money -
thereby depressing the demand for commercial and residential property alike.
The demand problem was aggravated in both sectors by the stream of new
developments coming on to the market. By the beginning of 1993, when France
moved into technical recession for the first time since the Gulf war, the
commercial market was further depressed by weak confidence and the
escalating rate of business failures. The rise in joblessness had a similar
effect on the residential sector.
Rentals and purchase prices tumbled in both sectors: although the pressure
was most acute in the commercial districts of Paris and Lyon that had fared
best during the boom years. A recent survey by Jones Lang Wootton estimated
that average annual rentals for prime office space in the Golden Triangle
had fallen from FFr4,500 a square metre in the final quarter of 1990 to
FFr3,500 by the end of 1993. In La Defense, prime rentals declined from
FFr3,100 to FFr2,050 over the same period. In Part-Dieu they fell from
FFr950 to FFr850.
However the French property scene has been spared the same rash of
receiverships which were such a painful feature of the US and UK industries
in the early 1990s. This is because of the defensive structure of the
market, whereby the big banks and insurance groups that dominate property
ownership, step in to support vulnerable companies and to prevent them from
collapsing and thus creating a vicious cycle of over-supply and declining
prices.
The French recession is now over, or so Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister,
is anxiously attempting to assure the electorate.
The residential sector seems to be recovering first. Mr Andre Levy-Lang,
chairman of Paribas, recently said that the strains were easing in that
sector. Residential property prices are slowly starting to strengthen.
By contrast, commercial property is still generally depressed. There are
some exceptions, such as the retail sector which has perked up particularly
in the fashion sphere. The latest analysis of the French market by Knight
Frank &amp; Rutley also detected an increase in activity in the office letting
sector as tenants have taken advantage of low rentals. But it also cautioned
that this pick-up had little impact on the supply situation as most tenants
had simply moved from one property to another of the same size.
Investment activity is still sluggish, according to Jones Lang Wootton, with
the big banks and insurers still refusing to adjust the book valuations of
their property holdings to reflect the reduced values of the mid-1990s.
However, it noted that some institutions were making more realistic
revaluations.
But in the meantime, the government does not seem to have enough confidence
to reopen and redevelop the old finance ministry building on rue
Saint-Honore - however optimistic Mr Balladur purports to be.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Survey of European Property (3): Source of charm and
frustration - Foreign investors have to grapple with an antiquated telephone
network, an inordinate amount of red tape, uncertain property claims, and a
scarcity of good quality office space and accommodation / Czech Republic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Prague, with its old historic centre practically untouched by modern
developers, may be one of the best preserved capitals of the former
communist bloc.
But what gives the Czech capital much of its charm can also be the source of
much frustration for foreign investors who have to grapple with an
antiquated and overloaded telephone network, an inordinate amount of red
tape, uncertain property claims, and a scarcity of good quality office space
and accommodation, not to mention appalling levels of pollution.
After two years of slow progress following the 1989 'velvet revolution' that
overthrew the communist regime, the property market took off in 1992 with
demand exceeding supply by 2 1/2 times and causing prices to rocket.
A two-tier market developed, with speculative developments - mostly
refurbishments - aimed at extracting the maximum rents from foreigners, on
the one hand, and a Czech market with very low prices that had been fixed
during the communist period with no reference to market values, on the
other.
Strict planning and building constraints, combined with strong tenancy
rights and rent controls, exacerbated the shortage of office space, and
contributed to inflated prices that have made Prague more expensive than
Vienna, Milan or Brussels.
'In 1992, about 30 per cent of property coming on the market was reasonably
priced, but the rest was well over-priced. The market got carried away with
people selling at German prices,' says Mr Robert Neale of property
consultants Healey &amp; Baker.
Prices peaked at about DM65 for offices in prime site properties at the end
of 1992, but have fallen since to DM55-DM60 for the best locations and to
about DM50 elsewhere.
'In the early days there was a huge demand, but people got frightened off by
the high prices. Now the demand has been scaled down because the economy
will not grow as quickly as originally thought,' says Mr Alan Vincent from
consultants Richard Ellis. He believes prices will fall further as companies
seek simpler but more functional accommodation.
Price was not the only deterrent for companies looking for a central
European location. The bulk of the property on offer has been
refurbishments, and these tend to lack the flexibility and facilities
available in new accommodation. Many were of poor quality.
Richard Ellis calculate that roughly 70 per cent of the 12,000 sq m of
office space that came on the market in 1992 was refurbished property.
Refurbished accommodation represents 40 per cent of some 43,000 sq m of
office space supplied in 1993 and a forecast 40,500 sq m of new office space
expected this year.
'Most of those refurbishments should have been gutted out. Unfortunately
many people did superficial refurbishments, painting over the cracks. The
market has always been starved of quality space, and to some extent it still
is,' says Mr Neal.
Only a few developments offer high quality. The International Business
Centre (IBC), a joint development by France's Caisse des Depots and
Compagnie Generale de Batiment et de Construction, is regarded as offering
the best accommodation at the moment. The 24,000 sq m development was
completed last year and more than 70 per cent has been let, say Healey &amp;
Baker. Tenants include Societe Generale, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and mostly
companies with a foreign interest. The development is adjacent to the Atrium
Hotel and a large conference centre, and while it is slightly off the city
centre, it is close to the metro line and the north-south motorway.
The Charles Bridge Centre developed by Fingroup offers more than 3,000 sq m
of mixed-use space for offices, suites, shops and restaurants. It is a small
development but it has a unique location and views across Charles Bridge and
the river. The development, consisting of three fully-refurbished historical
buildings overlooking the Vltava river, is due to be completed in March.
Office space has been let at DM52 a sq m, mostly to foreign companies.
There are several other small developments under construction, or planned,
around the city centre including some refurbished palaces. The biggest
project in the centre is on Na Prikope, a mainly pedestrian street, where
the Caisse des Depots has bought a site for which it hopes to win planning
permission to build 10,000 sq m of shops and 20,000 sq m of offices. This is
the only large prime site development in the pipeline.
Because of planning restrictions and lack of financing, Prague missed out on
the larger developments seen elsewhere in post-communist eastern Europe. But
this may not be such a bad thing in the long term, says Mr Neale.
'Developers are limited especially in the centre, but this should have a
positive effect on rents and yields.'

FT  11 MAR 94 / Survey of European Property (2): Investors have returned in
strength - In some parts of the market, a gradual recovery of business
confidence is already resulting in increased take-up / Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After three years of severe recession, the UK property market is in the
throes of a spectacular recovery. Investors have returned to the property
market in strength, creating one of the most buoyant market for good quality
property since the 1970s.
The resurgence of the UK property market can be attributed to two factors:
the strength of the government bond market, and the anticipation of a
recovery in rental values.
The most powerful of these stimuli was the sharp fall in bond yields in
1993, when long gilt yields fell from 8.8 per cent to 6.4 per cent. As
equity and bond yields plummeted, the relatively high yields available on
property became increasingly attractive to investors.
More money became available for property from several sources. Institutions
increased their allocations to the sector, property companies earmarked new
funds for investment from the Pounds 2.39bn they raised from rights issues
and foreign investors increased their investment in UK property from Pounds
1.3bn in 1992 to nearly Pounds 2.2bn in 1993.
The weight of demand for property sharply drove down property yields. On
average, they fell by 0.8 per cent to 8.2 per cent in the second half of
1993, which is the largest fall over any six-month period since 1977,
according to Hillier Parker, chartered surveyors.
The uplift has benefited all sectors of the market, but has been
particularly marked in the retail sector, where yields on some high street
shops and retail warehouse parks have fallen to record lows.
The London office market, which was for several years shunned by investors,
has also staged a remarkable recovery. It registered a record annual decline
in yields last year, when they fell by 1.8 percentage points to 8.3 per
cent.
Property yields are expected to continue to move downwards, in the view of
UBS, the brokers. It cites the rapid fall of gilt yields, which has outpaced
the fall in property yields; the weight of money available for investment
and the likely resumption of rental growth as reasons for expecting average
yields to fall throughout 1994, even if gilt yields rise significantly
during this period.
So far, the occupational market has made a relatively small contribution to
the turnaround in the performance of the property sector. Although the fall
in rental values slowed in the final quarter of 1993, rents continued to
decline in December, at a rate varying from 2 per cent in the rental market
to 10 per cent in the office market, according to the Investment Property
Databank, a research group.
However, the health of the occupational market is improving, particularly in
cities outside London, which suffered less severely from the recession than
London and are not burdened with such a large oversupply of space.
In some parts of the market, a gradual recovery of business confidence is
already resulting in increased take-up. An upturn in tenant demand last year
pushed the availability of offices in central London down by more than a
fifth to stand at 14 per cent of the total stock, according to DTZ Debenham
Thorpe.
Savills, a firm of property advisers, believes that rents on top quality
London offices are poised for a revival. Over the next three years, it
predicts a 15 per cent annual increase in rates for top-grade space in the
City of London to an average of Pounds 46 per square foot. In the West End,
it predicts a 12 per cent annual rise to an average of Pounds 51 per sq ft.
The retail sector is already showing signs of an upturn, despite the patchy
nature of the recovery in the retail sector. The balance between supply and
demand has improved as a result of a modest improvement in take-up, together
with a decline in development activity which has fallen since reaching a
peak in 1990.
These factors have resulted in a fall in shopping centre vacancy rates from
33 per cent to 26 per cent over the past year.
The industrial property sector is also beginning to improve, having
registered the first fall in available floorspace since May 1989. King
Sturge, a firm of chartered surveyors, believes that the amount of available
industrial space dropped by 1 per cent to 180.5m sq ft in the last four
months of 1993.
A revival in the occupational market will help the recovery of the
investment market become more broadly-based.
So far, the type of property being sought by investors has been
predominantly high quality, institutional-grade property, with secure
incomes paid by financially-strong tenants. But as concern about tenant
bankruptcies diminishes, investors are placing less emphasis on security and
more on the potential for rental growth.
The extent of the revival of the property market will also depend on the
attitude of the banks, which are largely responsible for financing
second-tier properties which do not play a part in institutional portfolios.
As the rental market improves and the banks' willingness to lend to the
sector increases, the improvement in property values will spread more widely
throughout the market.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Survey of European Property (1): Investors are tempted back
 -Buyers are seeking opportunities as the market sinks towards the bottom of
the property cycle / Introduction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Europe struggles to emerge from recession, most of its property markets
remain deeply depressed. However, some investors are beginning to trawl the
markets for bargains, in the belief that prices are close to reaching the
bottom of their cycle.
So far, contra-cyclical investment activity has been limited. The exception
has been the UK investment market which attracted Pounds 2.2bn of overseas
money last year, as it staged a strong recovery.
However falling interest rates across Europe, coupled with relatively high
yields from property compared with other investments, are beginning to tempt
contra-cyclical investors back into the market. Paris, Madrid, Milan and
Lisbon are some of the continental European cities being scrutinised most
carefully.
Investors believe that if they get their timing right, they may buy near the
bottom of one of the deepest troughs of any post-war property cycle. 'As
markets move to the bottom of their cycle, there will be clear opportunities
during the year, ahead of an economic upswing, to do business at extremely
attractive prices,' says Jones Lang Wootton, chartered surveyors.
Average capital values of prime offices in Europe's 14 largest property
markets have fallen by a third from their peak in March 1991, according to
Jones Lang Wootton. They are now at their lowest levels in real terms since
1986.
Some common themes run through many of Europe's property markets. The strong
economic upturn in the latter part of the 1980s resulted in increased
construction of new buildings, which came on stream at a time when the
recession had eroded tenant demand. As a result, vacancy rates have risen,
rents have fallen and investment yields have come under pressure.
The difficult economic conditions which have undermined occupational demand
in the past couple of years are generally expected to ease somewhat in 1994
 -although economic growth is expected, at best, to be limited. Moreover,
most established office markets now have a limited supply of new buildings
in the pipeline, which should help supply and demand come closer to
equilibrium.
But despite the similarities of the influences affecting Europe's markets,
there are marked differences in the structure and state of different
markets. They are influenced by their legal systems, planning laws, tax
regimes, bank lending policies, and accessibility to foreign investment, as
well as their stage of the economic cycle.
The greatest contrasts are those between the established markets of western
Europe and the fledgling markets of central and eastern Europe, which
continue to be hampered by legal and financial difficulties.
In Poland, there are problems with land title and financing continues to
restrict the number of new developments - except in the hotel sector, where
there is a surfeit of rooms at the top end of the market.
In the Czech Republic, all the large projects planned for central Prague
have collapsed, thanks to ownership problems, planning obstacles, financing
difficulties and the cautious approach adopted by potential occupiers.
In Hungary, many of Budapest's proposed office schemes have been postponed
or cancelled as a result of difficulties in raising finance. Investment
activity is largely limited to development projects or acquisitions by
owner-occupiers.
In Russia, last December's new constitution has strengthened private
property rights. But investment has been inhibited by red tape and political
instability.
Europe's more established property markets also present obstacles for
investors seeking bargains. In many of continental Europe's largest markets,
property values have not fallen as freely as in the UK.
In Belgium, the presence of the EU helps to stabilise the Brussels office
market, although the recession has pushed up vacancy rates. In the second
half of 1993, the fall in long-term interest rates stimulated investment
and, in particular, the market for securitised property.
In the Netherlands, the decentralised structure of the property market,
coupled with the dominant role played by institutions, has ensured that the
market remains more resilient than most.
In Paris, the investment market is still sluggish, as big banks and insurers
refuse to adjust the book valuations of their property in line with the
decline in the market.
In Germany, the investment market has remained remarkably robust, in spite
of economic difficulties. Strong demand from investors, led by the
open-ended property funds which have benefited from a large inflow of money,
ensured that yields stabilised in 1993 and in some cases improved.
In Spain, the recession which emerged midway through 1992 drove rents down
by as much as 40 per cent in some buildings. The sharp falls in values have
encouraged some interest from international investors anticipating recovery.
In one of the largest investment deals in recent years, Fomenta de
Construcciones y Contratas - one of Spain's large private corporations  -
bought a portfolio of office buildings and retail centres for Dollars 350m,
about a third of its peak value two years ago.
In Portugal, the investment market remains underdeveloped, largely because
existing laws give tenants perpetual security of tenure without any
open-market reviews.
The UK property market has performed more strongly than any other European
market, despite the patchy nature of the UK recovery. As bond yields fell
last year, the returns available on well-let UK properties with secure
incomes became increasingly attractive. Investors returned to the market in
force, creating one of the strongest bull markets for good quality property
since the 1970s.
The strength of the revival in the UK office market will not necessarily be
replicated in other European cities. London benefits unusually from the
liquidity and size of the market and the security of income derived from its
long lease structure.
Indeed, predictions of a general recovery in European property markets would
be premature. Nonetheless, if interest rates were to edge downwards, there
should be selective opportunities for investors to buy property at
historically low prices.

FT  11 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Recs setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Regional electricity stocks (Recs) were given an uncomfortable ride as
marketmakers, seeking to find a viable trading level for the shares, cut
prices with increasing vigour throughout the session, trying to uncover
cheap buyers.
Utilities specialists were at pains to point out that there was no scare
story or bad news behind the recent bout of weakness in the shares, other
than the slide in index-linked gilts, which often prove a reliable guide to
trends in the utilities. 'There is no big news on these stocks until the
distribution review in the summer,' said one analyst, who added that the rec
yields were approaching all-time relative highs.
The two recs in the FT-SE 100, Eastern and Southern, fell 13 and 14 to 625p
and 635p respectively. Others absorbed even bigger losses, with Norweb 19
off at 649p.
The day's highest volume of the FT-SE 100 constituents was recorded in
conglomerate BTR, which resisted the market's afternoon fall after
surprising dealers with a 13.4 per cent dividend increase and a 19 per cent
improvement in profits.
Turnover at the close was 24m and the shares closed 10 ahead at 387p.
Analysts were particularly cheered by a positive results meeting and several
brokers upgraded current year profit expectations. The list of upgrades
included Strauss Turnbull which raised its forecast from Pounds 1.38bn to
Pounds 1.495bn, a figure which includes gains on disposals.
Bank stocks were sharply in focus as Barclays completed the results season
by announcing disappointing figures. However, an early downturn in the share
price was reversed as analysts returned from the post-results meeting
satisfied with Barclays' strategy plans. 'The figures were bad but the
market is still in love with Martin Taylor (the chief executive),' said one
dealer.
Barclays fell to 488p after the results but rallied to close 8 higher at
510p. Turnover of 18m shares was the heaviest since last year's preliminary
figures, which included the shattering news that the dividend was being cut.
Abbey National, up 9 at 498p, and Lloyds, 11 firmer at 578p, were the other
strong performers in the sector.
A block of 3m National Westminster shares was thought to have been
successfully placed only marginally below the ruling market price. NatWest
ended a penny off at 466p.
Willis Corroon's figures were well received, the shares advancing 16 to 223p
on heavy turnover of 5.6m. Results from Refuge, the life group, proved an
acute disappointment to the market, however, the stock sliding 21 to 359p.
Leading pharmaceutical issues were weak in late trading as news reports said
that Mrs Hillary Clinton, who heads the US administration's health care
reform programme, might have invested in a hedge fund which sold short
several health care stocks last year.
Glaxo closed 2 1/2 lower at 661p and SmithKline Beecham 'A' shed 3 to 395p.
Wellcome declined 9 to 626p, with analysts expecting imminent publication of
last year's Anglo-French Concorde study which found that AZT, the Aids
treatment, was less effective than previously thought.
Smith &amp; Nephew firmed a penny to 144 1/2 p on full-year profits of Pounds
170.6m.
Chemicals stocks were strong against the trend, with Smith New Court
recommending ICI, Courtaulds and Laporte. ICI gained 8 at 775p and started
to show signs of breaking out of a tight range, Courtaulds advanced 11 to
553p and Laporte added 9 at 804p with Hoare Govett also on the bid.
Conglomerate Hanson hardened a penny to 271 1/2 p after announcing the
long-awaited terms for the flotation of its Beazer Homes business in the UK.
Hanson has set a price of 165p per share. It is selling 280.8m shares but
only making 70.2m available to the public.
A rise in profits in line with market expectations from Hillsdown was offset
by a disappointing results meeting. The shares lost 8 at 166p.
Food retailers were generally firm, with SG Warburg reiterating its positive
stance on the sector. Analyst Mr Neil Currie said the downside to further
margin erosion in the industry - an issue which has crippled the supermarket
stocks' rating - was now extremely limited. Warburg is particularly keen on
J. Sainsbury, up 6 at 368p.
Mirror Group Newspapers climbed 12 to 186p on hefty institutional buying
that saw 3.7m shares traded. Next week's results are likely to be well
received.
Advertisers Saatchi &amp; Saatchi rose 5 to 146p ahead of figures due next
Tuesday.
TI Group tumbled 25 to 409p, recording the day's biggest retreat among FT-SE
100 stocks, with analysts unimpressed by the company's post-results meeting.

FT  11 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Brewery stakes offloaded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent heightened activity among drinks stocks burst dramatically into
the open yesterday as Whitbread offloaded a substantial chunk of its
holdings in six domestic brewers in a deal valued by the company at Pounds
225m. The move prompted sharp falls among the stocks, while Whitbread shares
shot forward.
Dealers said BZW had taken on the entire Whitbread holding and sold on the
shares to institutions - one of the biggest bought deals seen in the market.
In the case of Boddington, in which Whitbread had a near 20 per cent stake,
BZW was thought to have bought the stock at 271p a share and placed it at
276p - a 6.5 per cent discount to the overnight price. 'It was brave
broking,' said one rival trader admiringly. Other blocks showed Greene King
being bought at 494p and sold at 499p and Vaux going through at 263 1/2 p
and 266p, a deep discount to the underlying share price.
The Boddington stake was said to have been snapped up quickly, as was the 10
per cent holding in Greene King. Vaux (6 per cent) and Greenalls (3.2 per
cent) were said to have gone smoothly, but there were question marks at the
end of trading as to whether all the 21 per cent in Marston had been
successfully shifted. One trader said some 3m shares remained unsold. The 12
per cent stake in Morland was also thought to have gone through in late
trading.
By the close, Boddington shares had fallen 9 to 286p with 47m turned over,
Greene King was 11 off at 518p on volume of 8.3m, Vaux was steady at 284p
with turnover of 18m, Morland slipped 2 to 508p, and Marston fell 7 to 290p
on 35m. Whitbread surged forward, but faded to close 5 ahead at 552p.
Analysts said the sale wiped out Whitbread's debt and could launch the group
on the acquisition trail, with a retailing outfit in its sights. They added
that the benefit to the group's earnings would result in an upgrade of
profits forecasts of around 3 per cent.

FT  11 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Early gains reversed after Wall
Street opens - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A setback in the US bond markets had greater effect on London than on other
European financial centres yesterday. UK stocks made good headway in the
first half of the session, encouraged by dividend and profits reports. But
share gains were reversed hurriedly in mid-afternoon when British government
bonds came off the top sharply as US Federal securities opened lower.
Trading volume was moderate, with an increase of nearly 24 per cent in the
day's Seaq total reflecting little more than a burst of activity among
regional brewing stocks as Whitbread unloaded its stakes in 10 smaller
brewers by selling them to one marketmaker, which then passed them on to
institutions.
After an uncertain start, the FT-SE 100 Index advanced by 17.3 to the day's
peak of 3,264, following bond markets which strengthened in response to a
favourable report on the US economy from the Federal Reserve.
Excellent dividend and profits from BTR encouraged a stock market now
looking for its lead from the corporate sector. Barclays Bank and
Rolls-Royce were among others to show evidence of improving trading
conditions for British companies.
The setback, when it came, was swift and the FT-SE 100 ended the day at
3,233.9 for a net loss of 12.8. Weakening sentiment in gilt-edged markets
was quickly translated into falls in stock index futures. Equity traders
were hard put to explain the late fall, but noted political uncertainties in
the US and comments from the president of the Bundesbank, although neither
factor appeared to justify the reversal of trends in UK equities and bonds.
Some strategists said that European markets are likely to turn nervous every
time worries over Federal Reserve intentions resurface.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index escaped the late sell-off but ended 4.6 off at
3,908.4. Seaq volume of 901.1m shares compared with Wednesday's 730.2m,
which was worth a healthy Pounds 1.65bn at retail, or customer, level.
The contrast between the first and second halves of the trading session was
well displayed by the success, in stock market terms, of the Whitbread deal,
which was worth well in excess of Pounds 200m and among the largest of its
type seen in the UK market.
The stocks involved were taken up quickly and without greatly affecting
share prices. 'A bold stroke by a confident marketmaker,' was the comment
heard in the dealing rooms. Whitbread was known to be intending to sell the
share stakes, but the planning of the deal was immaculate.
However, in the afternoon, shares across the Footsie range crumbled when
sentiment turned negative and some traders predicted a weak opening today,
especially if the Dow Average fails to recover from the 24-point fall on
record at the London close.
Although most analysts of the London market appear to agree that the
sell-off of the past three weeks has been overdone, they also warn that the
risk of further losses remains high. European bond markets are still proving
highly sensitive to moves or news from the US Federal Reserve.
With further tightening in Fed credit policies still widely predicted, stock
markets in London and elsewhere in Europe are expected to suffer repeated
bouts of nerves, and yesterday afternoon's performance may prove to be just
one example.

FT  11 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An already fragile London derivatives sector once again came under pressure
late in the session on the back of a retreat in US bonds and early falls on
Wall Street, writes Joel Kibazo.
In stock index futures on the Liffe, the March contract on the FT-SE 100
ended at 3,218, down 19 from its previous close and around 12 points below
its estimated fair value premium to cash of about minus 8.
Sporadic buying of March was seen earlier in the session which sent the
contract to the day's peak of 3,262. But buying interest had faded by
lunchtime, with US houses reported to be leading the market lower
The afternoon slide in bonds increased the selling pressure and March fell
sharply in response. Further selling in after-hours' trading saw March slip
back to 3,203, with volume at 20,414lots. Increased rolling forward into the
June contract brought turnover of 8,203.
In the FT-SE Mid 250 on the Liffe, 106 lots were traded and it closed at
3,907. The same contract on the OMLX saw business of 6 lots and it ended at
3,908.4.
Volume in the Liffe traded options improved to 39,393 contracts. The index
options were the busiest, with 16,270 traded in the FT-SE 100 option and
9,177 in the Euro FT-SE 100 option.

FT  11 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow under pressure from
declining bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Declining bond prices once again put the US stock market under pressure,
with equities posting sizeable losses yesterday in the wake of another big
sell-off in the Treasury market, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which at one point had been off almost 40
points, was down a net 22.79 at 3,830.62. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 weakened
3.16 to 463.90, while the American SE composite slipped 2.01 to 464.78 and
the Nasdaq composite shed 3.96 to 789.09. New York SE trading volume was
369.4m shares.
For the third day in a row, early declines in bond prices prompted selling
of stocks. Yesterday, the losses on the bond market were considerable. By
late afternoon the benchmark 30-year government issue was down 1 1/4 points
and the yield had risen to 6.938 per cent.
Analysts said bonds fell because the market was worried by a decline in the
dollar and a jump in the gold price, both potentially inflationary
developments, and because bond futures prices fell sharply on derivatives
markets.
With long-term yields rising to more than 6.9 per cent, stock market
investors took fright, pushing the Dow sharply lower. Analysts said share
prices were also undermined by speculation in foreign and US markets,
particularly among futures traders, that the rapidly developing Whitewater
scandal was threatening Mr Bill Clinton's presidency.
The day's only economic news - a 32,000 increase in weekly initial
unemployment claims - had little impact on market sentiment, although the
rise in claims was larger than Wall Street had been expecting.
International Paper fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 69 1/2 , continuing its recent
decline in the wake of a profits warning from the company.
Cyclical shares were hit by selling. Among the biggest losers were Minnesota
Mining &amp; Manufacturing, which receded Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 104 1/2 ,
Alcoa, with a fall of Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 73 1/8 , and General
Electric, down Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 104 1/2 .
Dr Pepper/Seven-Up climbed more than Dollars 3 to Dollars 28 5/8 in early
trading on a report that UK confectionery and drinks group Cadbury
Schweppes, which has a 25 per cent equity stake in the former, is interested
in acquiring the rest of the company. Cadbury, however, later poured cold
water on the suggestion, and Dr Pepper retreated to end Dollars  1/2 up at
Dollars 25 1/2 .
The stocks of bank and brokerage companies, whose earnings are likely to be
hit by rising interest rates, were mostly lower. Among banks, Citicorp lost
Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 38 1/8 and Chase Manhattan Dollars  3/8 at Dollars
31 1/2 , while among brokerage stocks, Salomon dipped Dollars  5/8 to
Dollars 51 3/4 and Merrill Lynch Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 40 7/8 .
On the Nasdaq market, Spectrum Information Technology rose Dollars  1/2 to
Dollars 3 7/16 after Mr John Sculley, its former chairman, dropped his
lawsuit against the company. In the same sector, Intel fell Dollars 1 1/2 to
Dollars 70 1/8 after a California jury ruled against the company in a
copyright case.
Canada
Toronto closed flat after busy trading, with a surge among gold shares
offset by declines in most other groups.
The TSE 300 index lost 1.3 points at 4,443.2 and declines slightly exceeded
rises by 389 to 378 after volume of 100.4m shares. The golds group added 3.4
per cent as the bullion price jumped USDollars 8 an ounce to USDollars
387.35 in New York.

FT  11 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Oil price trend the joker in Oslo's
hand for 1994 - Karen Fossli on prospects for Norwegian equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last month Norway hosted the Winter Olympics, and captured 10 gold medals on
home ground. This performance has been echoed in the Oslo stock market,
where Norwegian equities, which slightly outperformed continental Europe in
the bonanza year of 1993, have moved well ahead of a faltering field this
year.
Furthermore, in spite of a recent market setback, and potential for further
weakness and turbulence in the short to medium-term, several analysts
believe that Norwegian shares have plenty of room to move up before they are
fully priced.
The market this year has moved from a fixation on domestic interest rates to
being driven by liquidity and corporate earnings, although interest rates
still remain an important factor.
Blue chip earnings for 1993 have been emerging recently in line with, or
slightly higher than, analysts' forecasts. However, since hitting a high for
the year of 688.23 on February 4, the same day that the Federal Reserve
tightened US monetary policy, the market has shed 4.4 per cent, coming under
recent pressure from firmer interest rates and a weaker dollar.
Norway is served best by a firmer dollar because of its export-driven
industries, consisting mainly of light metals and crude oil production, and
it is here that potential for short-term volatil-ity lies.
Goldman Sachs believes that Norwegian interest rates - currently about 5 per
cent for short rates and 5.84 per cent at the long end - have been
surprisingly resilient in view of recent international turmoil and weaker
oil prices.
The American bank cautions that Norway is dependent on international events
and is likely to continue to take direction from these, but believes that
there is, as yet, little fundamental reason to turn bearish on the longer
term outlook when considering the current valuation of the stock market
relative to interest rates.
It says there is still plenty of room for either the stock market or
interest rates to move up before the historical valuation relationship is
hit. But any negative development in crude oil prices is likely to cause a
dramatic rise in domestic interest rates.
Mr Kjell Skjevesland, a director at the Oslo-based Norse Securities, is also
concerned with the oil price/interest rates connection. Oslo's all-share
index could advance by a further 15 to 20 per cent this year, he says, but
he believes that in the short to medium-term the performance of Norwegian
equities will be determined by oil prices and interest rates.
'If oil prices fall to below Dollars 12 a barrel, alarm bells will sound and
interest rates are likely to shoot up,' he maintains. 'I believe, however,
that the Bundesbank is likely to cut rates in the next couple of weeks,
which will be good news for domestic rates and equities.' The joker, he
emphasises, is the oil price.
Oslo equities should also be supported by the solid condition of the
Norwegian economy. Gross domestic product grew by 2.5 per cent last year and
is expected to expand by between 3 and 3.5 per cent in 1994.
Inflation, at 2.3 per cent in 1993, was among the lowest levels in Europe,
and could sink to below 2 per cent in 1994. Wages last year increased by
just 2.7 per cent, the smallest rise for 30 years, and are expected to
remain unchanged in 1994. Private consumption is forecast to grow by 3 per
cent this year and next, fuelled by higher real wage increases and lower
interest rates.
Mr Michael Thompson, an analyst with James Capel, is very bullish and points
out that in spite of the economic sluggishness of Germany, one of Norway's
main trading partners, Oslo's earnings prospects have improved to the extent
that the market, at this early stage in the year, is already trading on just
14.5 times earnings.
Mr Thompson adds, however, that Oslo's advance could be stemmed by companies
tapping the market for fresh equity. Last year NKr6.6bn was raised, but he
believes that this could increase to NKr8.5bn in 1994.

FT  11 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei ahead as Bangkok
falls 1.9 per cent

A rise in the government bond market and a fall in the yen encouraged
investors, and the Nikkei 225 average advanced 1.3 per cent on arbitrage
buying, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index gained 251.52 at 20,090.71 after a day's low of 19,880.59, and
high of 20,114.41 just before the close. Foreigners were active buyers in
the afternoon, drawing in domestic individuals and dealers.
Hopes of an easing of tension between the US and Japan over trade also
prompted buying. There was speculation that Mr Ichiro Ozawa, shadow
co-ordinator of the coalition government, would visit the US in an effort to
defuse the trade row. Investors were also cheered by reports that Motorola
and Ido, a Japanese mobile phone company, had reached agreement on increased
foreign access to Japan's mobile phone market.
Concern over the large arbitrage overhang, ahead of the March options and
futures settlements today, subsided following the decline in the balance of
arbitrage positions during the past few days.
Volume amounted to 400m shares, against Wednesday's 332m. Rises led declines
by 649 to 377, with 149 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first
section stocks put on 11.02 at 1,616.51 and the Nikkei 300 added 2.37 at
298.27. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 4.19 firmer at 1,345.83.
Telecom-related stocks gained ground after fears of trade sanctions by the
US receded. Nitsuko, the most active issue of the day, forged ahead Y150 to
Y1,650 and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone advanced Y13,000 to Y945,000.
Hopes of an increase in revenue supported brokerage issues. Nomura
Securities rose Y90 to Y2,320 and Nikko Securities Y50 to Y1,330. Banks were
lower on profit-taking. Sakura Bank fell Y40 to Y1,370.
Bakery and flour mill shares, which had advanced on speculation of benefits
from increased bread consumption due to the latest rice shortage, also
declined on profit-taking. Yamazaki Baking retreated Y40 to Y2,160 and Nitto
Flour Milling Y11 to Y569.
Higher gold bullion prices supported mining shares. Mitsui Mining and
Smelting moved forward Y10 to Y405 and Sumitomo Metal Mining Y30 to Y891.
In Osaka, the OSE average added 137.95 at 22,028.33 in volume of 129m
shares.
Roundup
Trading was largely lacklustre in the region, but technical factors provided
impetus in some markets. Bombay was closed.
BANGKOK fell 1.9 per cent as banks were sold amid growing worries about
their profitability after the central bank's move to raise provisions for
doubtful debt. The SET index shed 26.17 to 1,332.39.
SEOUL began gearing up for a rally on plans to ease deposit restrictions on
investors' stock orders. Under the new regulations, institutional investors
will only need to deposit 20 per cent of the value of buy orders instead of
the current 40 per cent. The composite index edged up 0.73 to 878.58.
AUSTRALIA mustered a rise, although the market was dogged by directionless
trading. The All Ordinaries index put on 8.3 points at 2,155.1 in moderate
turnover of ADollars 480m.
NEW ZEALAND bounced after Wednesday's fall, the NZSE 40 Capital index rising
22.54 to 2,228.74 in thin trading.
MANILA also rallied, although turnover fell sharply as the mood remained
cautious. The composite index moved ahead 50.39, or 2 per cent, to 2,552.84.
HONG KONG was lower as investors adopted a wait-and-see attitude. The Hang
Seng index dipped 95.33 to 10,129.05 in thin turnover of HKDollars 4.14bn.
SINGAPORE was weakened by interest rate worries. The Straits Times
Industrial index breached the psychologically important 2,200 support level,
falling 28.75 to 2,194.10.
KUALA LUMPUR extended losses at the close as investors further liquidated
positions due to lack of leads from abroad and ahead of the long Hari Raya
holiday next week. The composite index slipped 10.43 to 1,046.0.
COLOMBO was again marked lower, the all-share index shedding 17.62 to
1,328.68 and taking the market's cumulative correction over the last week to
3 per cent, after a near 40 per cent rise since the start of the year.

FT  11 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses lose ground on US
weakness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Weakness in the US bond markets and, in the afternoon, in their European
counterparts left bourses mainly flat or lower after earlier gains, writes
Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT followed the pattern of the week, confident for a while but losing
all, or most of its verve by the end of the day. The Dax index rose 25.01 to
2,141.10 on the session but subsided, finally, to an Ibis-indicated
2,124.51.
Mr John Blackley of James Capel said that German investors saw better
prospects of a rate cut next week or, failing that, after the Fed's open
market committee meets in eleven days' time. Equities, he said, continued to
trail after bonds yesterday; bunds had a good rally in the morning session
but in late afternoon the June bund future was unchanged, after a rise of 60
basis points at one stage.
Turnover was level at DM9bn. Daimler, a current favourite on the switch from
BMW, ended just DM10 better at DM825 in London after an earlier gain of
DM25; Allianz, the insurer, went from DM45 up to DM6 down.
News driven stocks fared worse, Siemens closing just DM2.30 higher at
DM692.30 on the session, and dropping to DM675.50 after hours; Viag was
suspended on its DM2.3bn purchase of Bayernwerk, the electric utility, from
the Bavarian state; Mr Blackley said the price was higher than expected and
Viag could be marked lower today.
PARIS fell as the Bank of France decided not to cut its repo rates, and as
banks in the Paribas orbit seemed to get a sniff of the latter's rights
issue, announced late in the day. BNP fell FFr5.90 to FFr258.10 and Cie
Bancaire by FFr28 to FFr606 as the CAC 40 index fell 15.06 to 2,184.58.
Turnover was FFr4.2bn. Mr Michael Woodcock at Nikko Europe said that
Paribas, up FFr4 at FFr506, could move on the rights issue today.
The hotel group, Accor, was another major faller, losing FFr14 at FFr716
after the Belgian supreme court rejected its attempt to overturn an August
1992 ruling ordering it to pay more to minority shareholders of its Wagons
Lits acquisition; the estimated cost to Accor is in the region of FFr700m.
ZURICH was firmer but off its best levels after Wall Street's weaker opening
and lower US bond prices. The SMI index added 2.7 to 2,861.2 with some
support emerging from next week's expiry of index futures, with many
investors still believed to be short.
Brown Boveri rebounded after an early fall to finish SFr46 higher at
SFr1,171 on a dividend maintained in spite of high restructuring costs.
Nestle added SFr13 to SFr1,263: the company refused comment on US market
rumours that it planned to buy Gerber, the Michigan-based baby-food maker.
MILAN saw a mixed performance but the Comit index remained in positive
territory adding 0.85 to 663.74.
BCI fell L201 or 3.2 per cent to L6,107 on selling by investors allocated
shares in its privatisation. Of other recently privatised financials, IMI
fell L111 to L12,771 but Credito Italiano picked up L17 to L2,665.
Telecoms had a good day as March 19 was set for a decision on an exchange of
shares as a step towards their ultimate fusion. Stet, the state holding
company, added L93 or 2 per cent to L4,817 and Sip, its main operating
company, gained L180 or 4.3 per cent to L4,363 on reports that its licence
fee would be reduced progressively as compensation for losing its cellular
telephone monopoly.
Fiat bounced L119 higher to L4,970 as investor demand returned. Parmalat
shed L92 or 3.6 per cent to L2,448 in response to results and a bond issue
plan.
AMSTERDAM traded cautiously but found some confidence from a firm bonds
market and the AEX edged up 1.85 to 422.60.
Heineken bounced towards the end of trading and added Fl 2.20 to Fl 201.30.
According to one salesman the market had anticipated the company's good
results - released after the end of the session.
The aircraft maker, Fokker, which dipped in the previous session after its
results, lost a further Fl 2.90 to Fl 15.40. Philips was lifted US
institutional interest and improved Fl 1.40 to Fl 55.20; strong turnover was
seen in Polygram, which added Fl 1.60 to Fl 81.50 as Hoare Govett issued a
positive note on the global music business.
STOCKHOLM saw mixed corporate results, and the Affarsvarlden index fell 5.4
to 1,524.3.
Skandia, which posted record profits after the close on Wednesday, dipped
SKr10 to SKr161 on a planned SKr3bn share issue. Aga B fell SKr10 to SKr423
on results but Asea A were SKr7 higher at SKr604.
Volvo B were SKr7 lower at SKr683 in response to the company's 1993 loss,
due to write-downs of its Renault interests, and news that it may retain its
full 20 per cent shareholding in the French carmaker.
Hennes &amp; Mauritz, the retailer, surged SKr42 or 14 per cent to SKr340 as its
full year pre-tax profits proved well above market expectations.
ISRAEL suffered further erosion of sentiment following recent arrests for
alleged share manipulation. The Mishtanim index fell 8.12 to 202.08.
Blue chips were left at their lowest for the year and of the 1,190 shares,
64 were registering sellers only.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Markets Report: Clinton worries hit dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Clinton's political woes finally caught up with the dollar
yesterday as fears about further damaging disclosures knocked nearly two
pfennigs off the currency, writes Philip Gawith.
The dollar weakened in Asia as rumours circulated about President Clinton
resigning, and bearish sentiment spilled over into European and US trading.
It closed in London at DM1.6893, down from DM1.7070 on Wednesday, and in New
York it finished at DM1.6835.
The market is now split on the outlook for the dollar. While many observers
believe economic fundamentals continue to favour it, there is increasing
scepticism about where support for the currency is going to come from.
Either way, the market is now pricing an element of political risk into the
dollar. Until yesterday foreign exchanges had paid little attention to the
Whitewater land and financial scandal in which President Clinton and his
wife are implicated. With the story now grabbing the headlines of the
mainstream US media, however, it has increasingly impinged on the markets.
In Europe, meanwhile, the D-Mark put on a mixed performance. It was
unchanged against the French franc at FFr3.404, stronger against the Italian
lira, which fell to L990.1 from L988.6, and weaker against the Spanish
peseta, which recovered to Pta82.37 from Pta82.45.
Mr Rob Loewy, head of foreign exchange at Midland Global Markets, said the
catalyst for yesterday's weakness was increasing market concern that Mr
Clinton 'may find himself in a very, very difficult situation'. He added
that US institutional holders of dollars had been particularly keen to
unload some of their long dollar positions.
This selling needs to be seen against the background of general
disillusionment about the dollar's performance. At the beginning of the year
the US currency was seen by most as a virtual one-way upwards bet. Since
then, however, it has weakened by five pfen-nigs from the DM1.7340 position
where it started the year.
The dollar has also been undermined by the slow pace of monetary easing by
the Bundesbank, and fears that the US Federal Reserve will not tighten
policy as aggressively as previously anticipated.
To some observers it is a case of deja vu. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior
economic adviser at Bank of America, said it was back to a year ago when
bullishness about the dollar stumbled on the rocks of a slower than
anticipated monetary easing from the Bundesbank.
Mr Hawkins said he viewed the current dip in the dollar as a 'temporary',
and perhaps necessary, correction given the extent to which the market had
been long of dollars.
The carrying cost of holding dollar assets - on a one-month view there is a
2.5 per cent interest rate differential in favour of the D-Mark over the
dollar - also bites deeper when the outlook for the currency being held is
called more into question.
The Bank of America economist said there had not been 'huge aggressive
selling' of the dollar. Rather, it was a case of a 'still market looking for
a reason to kick the dollar around a bit'. The spectre of Mr Clinton's
political problems offered just this excuse.
Mr Jeremy Hodges, head of global foreign exchange sales at Lehman Brothers,
took a more gloomy view, commenting: 'I feel strongly that we are into a
downward dollar mode now.' He said he thought the dollar could fall as low
as DM1.60 (also the level Swiss Bank Corp has predicted for the dollar at
the middle and end of the year).
Aside from the interest rate and political risk arguments weighing on the
dollar, Mr Hodges cited two other factors giving reason for caution: that
'everything is priced into this dollar'; and, with investors dumping their
long dollar positions, it is difficult to see who will be willing to buy the
currency.
One option would be the central banks, and there were rumours yesterday that
the New York Federal Reserve was buying dollars just below the DM1.69 level.
It declined to comment.
In Europe, the Bank of France left its intervention rate unchanged at 6.10
per cent at a securities repurchase tender, held to inject money into the
money markets. Speculation that the BOF might trim the intervention rate
again - it was cut by 10 basis points on February 24  - receded on Wednesday
when the Bundesbank reduced its corresponding repo rate by only three basis
points.
Sterling had a quiet day with little interest in the currency. The market is
awaiting a raft of important data next week - unemployment, producer prices
and retail sales - to help form a view on the strength of the UK economic
recovery. It closed in London more than a pfennig weaker at DM2.5364 and was
nearly a cent higher against the dollar at Dollars 1.5015.
The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 731m of assistance
yesterday at the established rate of 5 1/8 per cent. The revised forecast of
the shortage was Pounds 700m.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chile's troubled copper giant
faces long haul back to health - David Pilling reports on the catalogue of
problems facing Juan Villarzu, Codelco's new president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There cannot be many Chileans who envy Mr his new job. As president of
Codelco Mr Villarzu will from today be expected to grapple with one of the
nation's most contentious issues, the modernisation of the world's largest
copper company.
As if this were not enough, Mr Villarzu is joining a state-owned company
still reverberating from the after-shocks of a futures scandal that caused
losses of at least Dollars 206m - 0.5 per cent of Chile's GDP. Those
rumblings, which have already claimed the jobs of eight executives, threaten
to continue for months, or even years, to come.
There are already suggestions that public condemnation of Codelco's
management team, considered arrogant and unaccountable, might hamper Mr
Villarzu's room for manoeuvre. 'To solve its problems, what Codelco needs is
an aggressive management not a conservative, cautious one,' says a former
company executive. 'But if you are being attacked by everyone all the time
no one will be able to move.'
On the other hand, the futures scandal has provided ample ammunition for
those seeking drastic reform - even privatisation - of what they regard as a
state dinosaur. In a report entitled 'Codelco: The Errors of a Giant', the
right-wing Liberty Institute argues that lack of control over futures
trading was symptomatic of Codelco's unwieldy structure.
Even before the futures fiasco, the incoming administration of
president-elect Eduardo Frei had committed itself to decentralisation and
the creation of a holding company. Last month, Mr Villarzu scrapped the
vice-presidency responsible for mediation between the Santiago headquarters
and its six divisions. He ordered the establishment of divisional
'administrative councils' to 'strengthen decision-making at that level'.
The role of Codelco's politically appointed board - apparently so far
removed from day-to-day decisions that it was unaware of the company's
speculative activities - is also to be examined. Pending too is the issue of
Codelco's contribution to the armed forces, which creams off 10 per cent of
returns from copper sales.
Modernisation is necessary, Mr Villarzu says, because 'costs have been going
up systematically for many years'. During 17 years of military government
Codelco did not develop a single new deposit, the life-blood of any mining
company.
Although Codelco, which produces 12 per cent of the world's copper, provides
Chile with a fifth of its foreign exchange earnings, its importance to the
domestic economy has diminished. Falling ore grades, rising costs and an
appreciating peso have chipped away at the company's treasury contribution.
Although annual production has remained at about 1.2m tonnes, transfers to
the state shrank from Dollars 1.96bn in 1989 to Dollars 891m in 1992. In
1994, that figure could dwindle to just Dollars 30m, according to Mr Jose
Pablo Arellano, budget minister.
To stop the rot, Codelco desperately needs to add a high-grade, low-cost
mine to its ageing quartet. Mr Villarzu has, however, rejected suggestions
that a law permitting joint-ventures with the private sector should be
extended to the development of so-called replacement deposits. 'We don't see
the necessity of insisting on this. . . We believe Codelco can exploit such
reserves on its own,' he says.
But it is unclear where the money for this will come from. Any hope that the
finance ministry, which sets Codelco's investment budget, will provide the
estimated Dollars 400m for Radomiro Tomic (a deposit with annual production
potential of 150,000 tonnes) have been severely dented. The government,
which is committed to social spending, may find it politically untenable to
divert precious resources to a state company that has just gambled away
millions of dollars of taxpayers' money.
Neither does the joint-venture alternative now look so unequivocally
attractive. The great fanfare over the commitment of Cyprus Amax/Lac
Minerals to pay Dollars 555m for a 51 per cent stake of the El Abra deposit
has died down following serious delays to contract signing.
Mr Villarzu may have to seek alternative solutions. Much discussed has been
the possibility of selling Codelco's non-core activities, such as the
Rancagua workshop or the 530MW thermo-electric power station at Tocapilla,
believed to be worth Dollars 600m.
Another idea - not included in recent capital markets legislation - is to
allow Codelco to borrow cash for new projects from Chile's private pension
funds, which have assets of Dollars 16bn.
Bringing new deposits on stream is only one task. Mr Villarzu is also
committed to lowering production costs at existing mines, which average 69
cents a pound, compared with an estimated 55-60 cents at the country's
private mines.
This year's target is to trim production costs by 3 cents. Groundwork has
been prepared by the previous management which managed to halt, if not
reverse, the seemingly inexorable rise in costs. This was achieved by
gradual staff cuts (to 22,000 from 27,000 in 1988), contracting out
peripheral activities, a crackdown on absenteeism and freezing wages and
productivity bonuses.
All this has further soured relations with union leaders, who blame
management negligence for the futures fiasco. And they are likely to regard
the break-up of Codelco as a surreptitious step towards privatisation.
But Codelco is no ordinary company and 'privatisation' is a word few dare
utter openly. Mr Villarzu is implacable. 'I am not in favour of privatising
Codelco,' he says. 'I am not in favour of privatising any state copper
company.'
For him the ultimate goal is clear: to 'transform Codelco into one of the
world's most profitable mining companies'. But, to achieve this, there will
have to be some drastic changes.
Mr Villarzu may yet have a surprise or two up his sleeve.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US funds 'turning to silver
market'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KALGOORLIE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US speculative funds that last year drove up the gold price have turned
their attention to silver, Mr Tim Green, consultant to the Gold Fields
Minerals Services consultancy group, said yesterday.
Talk in the market suggested they were targeting prices of USDollars 7,
Dollars 8 or even Dollars 9 a troy ounce, compared with last night's closing
London price of Dollars 5.37 1/2 , he added.
Mr Green pointed out that the US speculators were more 'at home' with
silver, which was a much more volatile market than gold. 'It is possible to
double the silver price in a year but that's not possible with gold. Also
there are no central bank sales to threaten the funds' strategy in the
silver market.'
He suggested at the Kalgoorlie Gold Conference that, because many
computer-based trading systems used by funds linked gold and silver prices,
any upward surge in silver would take gold along with it 'but not to Dollars
500 an ounce'.
Mr Green said the funds realised that the market was 'a good play' following
an astonishing rise in silver imports to India after that country
liberalised imports of the metal. This resulted in India importing 3,500
tonnes of silver last year, double the 1992 level and easily an all time
record.
Gold jewellery makers in the US were consuming 200 to 300 tonnes a year, or
double the quantity widely quoted in the industry, suggested Mr Jeffrey
Nichols, managing director of the American Precious Metals Advisors
consultancy organisation.
He said there was probably similar underestimation of gold jewellery
fabrication demand in other industrialised countries. 'This means that the
total world gold market supply demand balance is more bullish that can be
statistically documented,' he added.
Gold Fields Minerals Services' annual review of the gold market is the most
widely quoted statistical reference book and Mr Green said the organisation
had looked carefully when similar claims to Mr Nichols' had been made in the
past but it remained satisfied with its figures.

FT  11 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee price rally stalled -
Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COFFEE chalked up fresh three month highs at the London Commodity Exchange
yesterday and held on to most of their gains. But traders said prices seemed
to have stalled at predicted resistance.
The May futures position closed at Dollars 1,280 a tonne, up Dollars 20,
after being pushed to Dollars 1,285 earlier by trade buying and speculative
interest.
London Metal Exchange dealers said ALUMINIUM and COPPER prices finished
nicely positioned to build on stability and push higher. Three months
delivery Copper ended after hours 'kerb' trading unchanged on the day at
Dollars 1,906 after declines below Dollars 1,900 had failed to trigger
stop-loss selling. Three months ALUMINIUM also came through a test of
underlying support, ending at Dollars 1,285 a tonne, up Dollars 6, after
dipping earlier towards the downside chart point between Dollars 1,270 and
Dollars 1,275.
The London GOLD price built on Wednesday's rally, with 'quite aggressive'
physical buying lifting it Dollars 5.45 to Dollars 385 a troy ounce, dealers
said. The main impetus again came from investment fund buying at the New
York Commodity Exchange, where traders cited South African election worries
and the Whitewater affair among possible influences.

FT  11 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
New Zealand was the outstandingly strong wool market this week, with a
complete clearance and prices rising by 10pc or more compared with a strong
and dearer sale last week. Crossbred wool is now recognised as likely to be
in short supply in the months ahead, and some traders are believed to be
oversold. A surge in Chinese buying set off the latest rise, coupled with a
market background already increasing in strength. China also played a part
in what happened at Australian wool sales, with medium and broader Merinos
and crossbreds appreciably dearer while finer Merinos, previously favoured,
tended to level out. So far there are only some signs of better business
experienced by processors and manufacturers, accompanying the wool market
rise. The official Wool International Australian market indicator was
546c/kg on Wednesday.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cut-price coal stokes up
industry row in Australia - Nikki Tait on an acrimonious dispute sparked by
the latest supply deals with Japanese steel mills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All is not well in Australia's coal industry. Last week, hundreds of
striking miners swarmed across the grassy knoll at Parliament House,
protesting at the recent price-cuts agreed between the nation's coking coal
producers and the Japanese steel mills. The miners' six-day protest action
shut down mines in Queensland and New South Wales. Coal companies costed the
lost production at ADollars 170m.
The two sides are due to meet at the Australian Coal Industry Council on
Monday, a tripartite discussion forum brokered by Mr David Beddall, the
federal resources minister. On the union side, there is a demand for an
inquiry into pricing and, underlying this, a long-standing suggestion that
Australia should negotiate its annual coal contracts with the all-important
Japanese buyers on a collective, not an individual company, basis.
Coal, after all, is the country's biggest export, and over 40 per cent goes
to Japan. If the buyers are working as a cartel, doesn't it make sense for
suppliers to do likewise?
From the companies' side comes a warning that even an inquiry of this nature
could send damaging signals to customers. If anything is to emerge, says Mr
Denis Porter at the New South Wales Coal Association, it should be a review
which looks more broadly at obstacles to growth in the industry's
efficiency, not 'a witch-hunt into pricing'.
The unusual aspect to this spat is that parts of the financial community,
including broking houses like BZW and Potter Warburg, are equally critical
of the producers' deal-making. Without necessarily endorsing the union
notion of a 'national coal marketing board', analysts say that the
Australian-Japanese negotiations, which set an international marker for coal
prices, have become ritualised, and that this works to the sellers'
detriment.
The latest round, comments one analyst, 'was not a well thought-out
marketing effort. There didn't seem to be much co-ordination between
producers. . . When the Japanese offered something ridiculous, they got
frightened'.
The coking coal agreements were finalised in late-January. As usual, one
company led the round, in this case Broken Hill Proprietary. When the
agreement was unveiled, it showed price cuts ranging from 8.5 to 9.5 per
cent (in US dollar terms) for hard coking coal, and around 8 to 8.5 per cent
for soft. This was the fourth successive year that coking coal prices had
fallen, and even producers admitted they were shocked by the size of the
1994 drop. Coal shares tumbled.
BHP defended the deal on the grounds that Canadian producers, despite their
cost disadvantage, were waiting to snap up market share. More generally,
producers pointed to the enormous problems confronting the Japanese steel
mills at present, and to longer-term developments in steel-making technology
which mitigate against much upturn in coking coal demand.
No one, not even the unions, denies the buyers' parlous situation. But the
industry's critics point out that the Japanese are adept at picking off
large producers who will take bigger price cuts by offering them more
attractive tonnages. In a business with high fixed costs, this can be
persuasive. But it can also spell big problems - leading to downsizing and
lost jobs - for the smaller producers who are then obliged to mop up.
At the very least, critics think the system could be shaken up. Price
negotiations for steaming coal, where underlying prospects are brighter than
for coking coal, could go ahead of coking coal, perhaps. The coal companies
could pay more early attention to other Asian buyers, instead of being
fixated with Japan. More speculatively, the notion of establishing a coal
equivalent of the London Metal Exchange could be considered.
Mr Leigh Clifford, CRA group executive for energy resources, says this would
only add dangerous volatility. 'Sure, the price can go up, but it can also
go down,' he comments. 'And you can't do anything about it'.

FT  11 MAR 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries fall sharply in late trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
After weakening in the morning on a higher gold price and a weak dollar, US
bonds dropped sharply yesterday afternoon.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was down 1 1/4 at 91 11/32 ,
yielding 6.938 per cent, and the two-year note was down  3/32 at 99 3/8 ,
yielding 4.944 per cent.
A lack of economic statistics left the market without a clear direction at
the opening. In generally listless trading, dealers focused on a rise in the
gold price, and a decline in the dollar against leading European currencies
 -both deemed bearish for bonds. The market was also unnerved by rumours
that President Clinton was facing a political crisis because of the
Whitewater affair.
During the afternoon, however, prices turned decisively lower, triggered by
falls in the 30-year bond and the June bond futures contract below important
support levels.
True to the recent pattern, European government bonds firmed in the morning
but fell back in the afternoon on the back of weaker US Treasuries.
Traders could not identify a clear trigger for the weakness, although it was
exacerbated by rumours that the Bundesbank would revise its January M3 money
supply growth data upwards. At an annualised rate of 20.6 per cent in
January, M3 has already massively overshot its 4 to 6 per cent target range.
The market was also abuzz with talk of more hedge-fund selling, although one
observer pointed out that volume on the futures exchanges did not seem to
indicate any selling as dramatic as last week.
'We're still very much in a bear market,' said Mr Graham McDevitt, bond
strategist with market analysts IDEA. 'In the morning, the market traded up
on thin volume, but when prices fell, volume was huge,' he said. This
indicates that 'there is no one out there supporting the up-moves,' he said.
Moderately encouraging comments from senior Bundesbankers failed to stem the
late slide in bunds.
Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer said the pursuit of anti-inflation
policies did not mean interest rates should stay unchanged, and also
welcomed the recent pay deal in the engineering sector. However, he added
that inflation was still too high and the Bundesbank would continue tracking
M3 as a key indicator.
Bundesbank council member Hans-Jurgen Koebnick said easing monetary policy
in Germany would not be affected by a rise in US short-term rates. 'In
Germany . . . we expect inflation to fall, whereas there are fears of rising
inflation in the US. Domestic factors will primarily determine both the
tempo and the extent of the lowering of German rates.'
The dollar's weakness against the D-Mark also supported bunds. The June bund
futures contract on Liffe ended at 96.40, up 0.05 points on the day but
below its 97.01 high.
UK gilts largely tracked bunds, erasing their early gains to end little
changed. Index-linked bonds put on a strong performance in the morning but
fell in the afternoon, with traders reporting a large switch into
conventional stock. The June long gilt future ended at 112 5/8 , up 1/16 .
French bonds underperformed bunds, partly on disappointment that the Bank of
France left interest rates unchanged. The notional March bond future on
Matif fell 0.08 points to 125.34.

FT  11 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: DTB fills gaps in yield curve
with two new products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Futures traders are gearing up for the launch of two interest-rate contracts
on the Deutsche Terminborse, Germany's financial futures exchange.
Today is the first day of trading in the DTB's long-term 'Buxl' future,
based on bonds issued by the German government and the Treuhandanstalt with
a remaining maturity of between 15 and 30 years. Next Friday, the
screen-based exchange plans to launch its long-awaited Fibor future, a
three-month interest-rate contract based on the Frankfurt inter-bank offered
rate.
'Now the spectrum will be complete - anyone who trades this market can play
the whole yield curve without any gaps,' said Mr Ralf Lemster, head of
derivatives sales and trading at Dresdner Bank in Frankfurt. The DTB already
lists five-year and 10-year bond futures.
Mr Jorg Franke, DTB chairman, said the Buxl future had been launched to meet
increased demand for long-dated debt, especially from international
investors.
'The rise in issuance at this part of the yield curve has shown that there
is a real need for long-dated bonds in the cash market,' and a hedging
instrument was needed to round off the picture, he said. Since December
1993, Germany has issued DM27bn of 22-year and 30-year bonds.
Despite some concern over the liquidity of the underlying market, most are
confident that the Bundesbank's commitment to reinforcing Frankfurt's
position as a financial centre will ensure a steady supply.
'I expect to see at least one 30-year bond every six months - that's not a
lot, but enough,' said Mr Peter Kerger, head of futures and options at
NatWest Markets in Frankfurt.
Volatility in the 10-year bund future has jumped sharply following recent
market turbulence, and an even longer dated instrument is likely to be even
more volatile.
'It's not the easiest instrument to trade, but if we want to be an
international market, we have to offer these types of products,' said Mr
Lemster.
Moreover, said Mr Franke, the contract would offer cash investors a way to
hedge their very long dated positions during turbulent market conditions,
while providing short-term traders with a speculative instrument.
The Fibor future may be slower to take off, largely because Liffe already
lists a similar contract based on the British Bankers Association interest
settlement rate for three-month Euromark deposits.
'The Fibor future could be a flop,' said one dealer, noting that
'duplicating another exchange's products has never worked'. Moreover, he
feels that there is not enough Fibor-based business around to justify
creating a Fibor contract.
But others say that is precisely why it is needed. 'Once the Fibor future is
in place, it could spur the development of more Fibor-based instruments,'
said Mr Franke.
Some fear the underlying market may not be broad enough without issuance of
short-term government paper but hopes for such debt were dashed yesterday
when Bundesbank council member Johann Wilhelm Gaddum said the issuance of
treasury bills could interfere with the central bank's monetary policy.

The Budapest Stock Exchange has issued a list of international financial
institutions that would be allowed, if they so requested, to introduce
Hungarian forint-denominated securities on the bourse, Reuter reports from
Budapest.
The list was drawn up after the bourse amended its rules to allow foreign
financial institutions to bring such securities.
However, a stock exchange official said that Hungarian securities law would
also have to be amended before foreign institutions could introduce
forint-denominated securities. He added that this was under way.
The bourse listed the following organisations:
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the European
Investment Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the International Finance
Corporation, and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
The Inter-American Development Bank, the Nordic Development Bank, the
Caribbean Development Bank, the African Development Bank, and the Asian
Development Bank were also on the list.
Hungary's move to allow foreign institutions to list on the stock exchange
was triggered by the EBRD's plan to introduce a forint-denominated bond on
the Budapest bourse.
'The bourse council wanted to make it possible for the securities of these
financial institutions to appear (on the bourse),' a stock exchange
spokesman said. He added, however, that 'no official request has come from
any of them yet.'

US Treasury prices eased across the maturity range in listless trading
yesterday morning, with traders attributing the declines to a higher gold
price and the dollar's weakness.
Just before midday, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 21/32 at
91 15/16 , yielding 6.887 per cent, and the two-year note was down  1/16 at
99 13/32 , yielding 4.927 per cent.
The lack of important economic statistics meant the market lacked a clear
direction from the opening. The day's only release of any significance - a
32,000 increase in weekly jobless claims - had no discernible impact on
prices.
Instead, dealers focused on a rise in the gold price and a decline in the
dollar against leading European currencies - both deemed bearish for bonds.
Otherwise, sentiment remained subdued, with investors reluctant to commit
funds to a market still vulnerable to sudden and sharp sell-offs.

FT  11 MAR 94 / International Bonds: Surprise Dollars 3bn FRN issue from
Sweden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Kingdom of Sweden's launch of a Dollars 3bn floating-rate note issue
caught the international bond market by surprise yesterday, with many
participants startled by the sheer size of the deal and the borrower's
audacity in tapping the market at such a difficult time.
Some syndicate officials claimed there was still plenty of seven-year paper
left over from Sweden's last sortie into the market in January. 'This smacks
of desperation - the markets are not in good shape and this is just putting
more spread pressure on the borrower's name,' said one rival syndicate
manager.
'This might be good for the lead manager's position in the league table but
it's going to take some time to sell,' added another.
Sweden's latest offering has an 18-month maturity and a coupon of 18.75
basis points below three-month Libor. The proceeds will be used to pay off
part of an Ecu5bn bank facility put in place at the time of Sweden's
currency crisis and which matures in September 1995. CS First Boston, the
lead manager, said Sweden had secured a lower borrowing cost in the bond
market, compared with a margin of  3/16 over Libor on the bank facility.
The lead claimed that in current market conditions investors want to be
invested in cash or very short-dated paper. 'This is a cash substitute, a
temporary parking place for investors to put their money,' said one
official, pointing out that investors would get a coupon of about 3 3/4 per
cent, against overnight money rates of 3 1/8 to 3 1/4 per cent.
CS First Boston put together a selling group rather than a formal syndicate
and underwrote the entire issue. It said it was supporting the deal at a
price of 99.91 - 99.92. First National Building Society, Ireland's second
largest building society, has launched the first ever issue of floating-rate
PIBS - Permanent Interest Bearing Shares.
The Pounds 25m issue counts as tier one capital and the paper will be priced
to yield 255 basis points over six-month Libor, which is currently around 5
1/8 per cent. Hoare Govett, the lead manager, said First National wanted to
'gear up its balance sheet and have a war chest ready' in preparation for
possible acquisitions in Ireland or the UK.

FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: Department store side hampers
Coles Myers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coles Myers, Australia's largest retailer, yesterday announced a rise of
just 3.6 per cent in after-tax profits during the six months to January 23,
and a 2.9 per cent improvement in group sales.
It blamed the weak figures on the nation's lingering unemployment and a
disappointing performance by Myer Grace Bros, its department store division.
Coles profits after tax totalled ADollars 245.1m (USDollars 176.3m) in the
six-month period, compared with ADollars 236.6m in the same 1992-93
half-year. Sales reached ADollars 8.16bn, up from ADollars 7.93bn. Operating
profits, before tax, slipped slightly, from ADollars 367.7m to ADollars
361.8m. Net interest charges were virtually unchanged.
The biggest problems came in the department store division, where operating
profits fell sharply, from ADollars 94.2m to ADollars 63.2m, on static sales
of ADollars 1.81bn. Coles said the division had been forced to clear 'a high
level of overstocked items' via some 'aggressive' markdowns. The group has
already made management changes in this area, and is looking for an
improvement in the second half.
The supermarkets division fared better, pushing up operating results from
ADollars 89.2m to ADollars 101.9m, while the Kmart discount stores advanced
from ADollars 86.7m to ADollars 91.4m.

FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: Profits fall prompts warning at
Cathay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Cathay Pacific Airways, Swire Pacific's Hong Kong-based international
airline, yesterday unveiled a 23.8 per cent drop in profits, to HKDollars
2.29bn (USDollars 296.2m) for calendar 1993, against HKDollars 3.01bn the
previous year. It warned that this year was going to be just as tough.
Mr Peter Sutch, chairman, said: 'In the short-term, we will continue to see
overcapacity on the major routes. We will continue to have high inflation in
Hong Kong and, as a result, frankly I don't see the results of 1994 being
much better or very different from those of 1993.'
Cathay is under increasing pressure on its prime routes, particularly with
the introduction of a Virgin Atlantic service between Hong Kong and the UK.
Mr Sutch said the fall in earnings - which was slightly less steep than
analysts had expected, partially due to contained costs - reflected a
downturn in demand in key markets, spiralling operating costs driven by the
colony's high inflation, and the flight attendants' strike at the start of
the financial year.
The industrial action, precipitated by the dismissal of three air hostesses
after they refused to temporarily fill junior positions during staff
shortages, cost the company an estimated HKDollars 240m in extra costs and
lost revenue.
Total yield was 8.2 per cent lower than the previous year, and the revenue
load factor also dropped, down 1.5 per cent to 68.9 per cent as continued
recession in key markets depressed ticket sales.
However, directors are proposing to hold the final dividend at 31.5 cents,
in line with last year's payout. Earnings per share slipped to 80 cents,
down from HKDollars 1.05.
'It was a difficult year, not just for our company but for the airline
industry as a whole. The overall performance was a great deal better than
most other airlines in the world, but we take little comfort from that given
the industry as a whole is in a pretty torrid state,' said Mr Sutch.
Where Cathay was at a sharper disadvantage to its competitors was the
inflationary environment in the colony, he said. Cathay has already sought
to mitigate the damage by transferring its accounts division across the
border to Guangzhou, establishing a computer centre in Sydney, and
stationing flight crews in other parts of the region.
Despite these and other moves to enhance competitiveness and efficiency
profit margins slumped further, to 9.6 per cent, down from 12.9 per cent in
1992.

WD &amp; HO Wills, the Australian tobacco group 67 per cent-owned by BAT
Industries, saw net profits fall 52.1 per cent to ADollars 15.4m (USDollars
11.1m) in the year to the end of December, on unchanged sales of ADollars
934m.
However, the decline was entirely due to a large ADollars 62.9m abnormal
item (up from a ADollars 10.3m charge the previous year).
Of this, ADollars 43.5m was explained by a change in the accounting basis
for tobacco licence fees. The remainder was attributed to restructuring
costs and property write-downs in manufacturing and distribution operations.
Wills said the underlying performance had been 'robust,' although sales
volume in Australia was down by just over 6 per cent in 1993, a trend it
blamed on tax rises.
Operating profits for the group overall, before abnormals and tax, rose 24.4
per cent to ADollars 84.9m.
The company's Papua New Guinea operations saw 'solid' profits growth,
although some overall market share was lost. The Fiji and Solomon Islands
operations had 'good years'.
Wills also announced plans to install a ADollars 40m tobacco leaf primary
processing plant at its Pagewood factory, and said it had decided to
contract out its distribution operations. This change will start to take
effect in the latter half of 1994.

producer

CPC International, the US-based multinational foods group, has invested R92m
(Dollars 26.5m) in a joint venture with Tongaat-Hulett, the
Anglo-American-owned aluminium, sugar and foods producer. The deal marks the
biggest re-investment in South Africa since the lifting of American
sanctions.
It follows the return of a number of US companies to South Africa this year,
including International Business Machines and Kodak. Pilsbury, a rival US
foods group, set up a partnership with local producer FoodCorp last year,
and Heinz is understood to be investigating a South African partnership,
possibly with the Premier Group.
CPC has exercised its option to buy a 50 per cent stake in Tongaat's
consumer foods division. The option was part of a licensing and technology
agreement signed by the companies in October 1993. The new company - CPC
Tongaat Foods - will invest R10m in a new dry foods plant.
The deal is complicated by CPC's disinvestment from South Africa in 1987,
when it sold the rights to a number of its brands - including Knorr,
Hellmann's and Marmite - to Hunt Leuchars &amp; Hepburn, a local foods supplier.
CPC Tongaat Foods will be restricted to marketing these brands outside South
Africa, Namibia and Botswana. However, it plans to introduce and produce the
rest of CPC's product range in South Africa for the local and sub-Saharan
export markets.
Mr Mohammed Wahby, vice-president of CPC Europe Consumer Foods, admitted
South Africa and many neighbouring countries faced severe political
troubles. However, he said: 'One should not wait for a solution to all
political problems before launching a sound business proposal.'
Mr Cedric Savage, managing director of Tongaat, said it was vital for South
Africans to establish joint ventures with international companies.

BTR Nylex, the quoted Australian offshoot of Britain's BTR group, yesterday
announced after-tax profits of ADollars 401.2m (USDollars 288.6m) for 1993,
a 9.8 per cent increase over 1992's ADollars 365.4m. Sales rose 8.4 per cent
to ADollars 6.21bn.
The diversified manufacturing group's operating profit, ahead of 'corporate
activities,' rose 7.7 per cent, to ADollars 855.2m. BTR Nylex attributed the
advance to 'the long-awaited improvement in economic conditions, together
with more efficient operating performance' in its core Australasian
businesses. It reported increased demand from customers in the automotive,
packaging and construction-related sectors.
Sales in Australasia rose to ADollars 3.27bn from ADollars 3.03bn, while
operating profit was ADollars 499.3m against ADollars 439.2m.
The North American interests also made progress, pushing up sales to
ADollars 1.12bn from ADollars 978.4m, and increasing operating profits to
ADollars 148.6m from ADollars 130.6m. BTR said new contracts at Continental
PET contributed to the advance.
However, operating profits in Asia were flat, at ADollars 117.3m against
ADollars 118.6m. The company said much of the region saw an improvement, but
that pricing and capacity pressures in Taiwan affected the polymer
businesses.
Europe took a larger profits tumble, down from ADollars 105.5m to ADollars
90m, a trend blamed on 'stagnant and competitive market conditions' and
restructuring disruptions at Rockware.
However, the group sounded a cheery note on current-year prospects, saying
the improving economies in North America and Australasia and the sustained
demand from Asia should be beneficial.

FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: Bridge Oil postpones flotation
of US offshoot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT

<TEXT>
Bridge Oil, the Australian oil and gas group, has postponed the proposed
stock-market flotation of its US operation, Bridge Oil (USA). It blamed
'current uncertainty' over crude oil prices.
The Sydney-based Bridge announced yesterday it intended to re-examine this
plan in the third quarter of 1994. It unveiled the flotation scheme in
December, and had hoped to finalise the transaction in the first quarter of
1994.
Bridge considered floating off the US oil and gas properties before, but was
thwarted by a previous fall in gas prices. Yesterday's announcement came as
it reported net profits of ADollars 27.6m (USDollars 19.8m) in the year to
end-December, compared with ADollars 39.4m last time. The figure was scored
after an abnormal surplus of ADollars 486,000, against ADollars 4.76m in
1992.
Pancontinental Mining, which was defeated in the bid battle for Aztec Mining
by Mr Robert Champion de Crespigny's PosGold Investments, said yesterday it
had not served offer documents on the target earlier this week - and hence
did not have an offer for Aztec which was outstanding.

charge, shed 4,400 jobs

<TEXT>
Raytheon, the Massachusetts-based defence group, is to cut up to 4,400 jobs,
or 7 per cent of its workforce, over the next two years and will take a
Dollars 162m after-tax charge in the first quarter to cover the
restructuring.
The move is the latest in the consolidation of the US defence industry,
which has been struggling with sharply lower Pentagon spending since the
collapse of the Soviet empire.
Raytheon said 65 per cent of the charges related to its defence business and
the rest to its commercial operations, which include the manufacture of
aircraft and appliances, as well as engineering and construction work.
Raytheon, best known for manufacturing the Patriot missile, said that
despite the charge, which works through at Dollars 1.20 a share, it will
still be profitable in the first quarter. It had net income of Dollars
157.5m, or Dollars 1.16 a share, in the same period of 1993.
The company is one of the largest employers in New England and the
centrepiece of its restructuring plan is the consolidation of its missile
manufacturing operations in the region into its Andover, Massachusetts,
plant.
This will result in the closure of facilities in Lowell, Northboro and
Norwood, Massachusetts.

FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: AMD wins round in Intel fight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A US court has reaffirmed Advanced Micro Devices' rights to use Intel
technology to compete in the lucrative microprocessor market. The jury
verdict, reached yesterday, represents a serious blow to Intel, the world's
largest chip maker.
AMD can use Intel's 'microcode', the internal software in a microprocessor
chip, the jury determined. It found that a 1976 licensing agreement between
the two companies granted the company the right to use the copyrighted
programs. During the trial, Intel argued that the agreement did not extend
to microcode.
The verdict ended a long-standing dispute between the two Silicon Valley
chip makers. In 1992, Intel won the first trial of the same case, but the
verdict was subsequently set aside when Intel was alleged to have withheld
relevant documents.
For AMD, the new verdict removes a serious threat that could, at least
temporarily, have forced the company to withdraw from the microprocessor
market.
'We feel that this verdict is a major, major victory,' said Mr W. J. Sanders
III, chairman and chief executive officer of AMD. 'For nearly a decade,
AMD's growth, profitability and indeed very existence have been threatened
by Intel's unwillingness to live up to its agreements with AMD, preferring
to compete in the courtroom instead of the marketplace. We are deeply
gratified that our rights have now been confirmed by the unanimous verdict
of a federal jury.'
Mr Sanders said that he was asking Intel 'to accept this verdict, recognise
that competition can be beneficial even to Intel, and end the harassment of
AMD in the courts'. However, Intel said that it would appeal against the
verdict and continue to pursue outstanding issues in two related disputes
between the companies.
'We now have two distinctly different jury verdicts,' said Mr Thomas Dunlap,
Intel general counsel. 'Therefore, the Court of Appeals must now decide
which verdict stands.
'AMD has always had the option of competing fairly in the market place by
writing its own microcode. If they chose to do that these disputes will be
resolved.'
Intel dominates the market with close to 90 per cent market share. 'Intel
made more profits in 1993 than the next nine semiconductor manufacturers
together,' noted Mr Sanders.
AMD said that it plans to ship over 900,000 Intel-style 486 microprocessors
in the current quarter, up from 350,000 in the last quarter, and is aiming
for a 25 per cent share of the world market for PC microprocessors. By
removing the legal cloud over AMD the verdict could boost demand for its
microprocessors, the company said.
Intel shares closed at Dollars 70 1/8 , down from yesterday's close of
Dollars 71 5/8 , while AMD shares rose from Dollars 22 3/4 to Dollars 29.

package
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
International Business Machines gave a 'golden boot' to Mr John Akers, its
former chairman and chief executive, who retired last April under pressure
from the board of directors as a result of the company's worsening financial
performance.
According to a shareholders' proxy statement issued today, Mr Akers received
a severance package of about Dollars 3.4m. This included Dollars 2.5m,
equivalent to one year's compensation, as part of a retirement incentive
programme.
In addition, the former IBM chairman was awarded a Dollars 925,000 payment,
equivalent to his annual base salary 'in recognition of his 33 years of
service to the company'.
Other payments for 1994 totalled Dollars 433,333 in salary and bonus for the
four months that he remained with the company.
Yesterday, IBM also announced that it had laid off 800 workers in New York
state. The layoffs are part of a planned reduction of 30,000 jobs. IBM said
that it aimed to reduce its workforce to about 225,000, from 256,000 last
July.

for year

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Aga, the Swedish industrial gas group, yesterday reported a 6 per cent
increase in profits after financial items to SKr1.56bn (Dollars 195m) for
1993, chiefly due to the weakness of the Swedish krona and the consolidation
of newly-acquired cold storage companies in France and Germany.
The company said it expected a further improvement in 1994 as the economies
in key markets improved and the benefits of rationalisation fed through. It
is raising the dividend to SKr10 per share from SKr9 per share last year and
proposes a five-for-one share split.
Consolidation of the French company CEGF and German Bremerhavener
Kuhlhauser, both acquired at the end of 1992, and the sharp fall in the
value of the Swedish krona last year helped push up group sales by 35 per
cent to SKr16.06bn from SKr11.87bn in 1992.
Operating profits were also up 28 per cent at SKr1.65bn, compared with
SKr1.29bn in 1992. Aga said most gas operations improved operating margins.
Frigoscandia, the cold storage and food processing business, reported
operating profits up dramatically at SKr275m from SKr145m thanks to the new
acquisitions.
Net financial expenses, excluding dividends and positive exchange rate
adjustments, leapt to SKr327m from just SKr3m in 1992. Net borrowings
increased to SKr4.4bn from SKr3.3bn.

Most of the main companies associated with Hyundai, one of South Korea's
leading business groups, reported higher profits and sales for 1993,
although several of its smaller concerns recorded losses.
Hyundai Corporation, the group's trading arm, reported that net earnings
rose by 3.7 per cent to Won5.45bn (Dollars 6.7m), although sales fell by 1.6
per cent to Won11,000bn as overseas shipments were disrupted by strikes
affecting several Hyundai companies last summer.
Hyundai Motor, the nation's largest car manufacturer, had a 39 per cent
increase in net profits to Won58.2bn as sales rose by 18 per cent to
Won7,180bn due to strong exports benefiting from a weak Korean Won.
The domestic car sales division, Hyundai Motor Service, suffered a 32 per
cent drop in net profits to Won17.3bn as low-interest consumer financing
offered by the company to boost sales put pressure on earnings. Sales
increased by 20.9 per cent to Won3,903bn.
Hyundai Engineering and Construction had a 9 per cent increase in earnings
to Won20.7bn as sales rose by 3 per cent to Won2,774bn.
South Korea's largest shipbuilder, Hyundai Heavy Industries, reported that
net profits declined by 21 per cent to Won221bn in 1993 as sales fell by 12
per cent to Won2,170bn.
The results reflected lower profit margins on ships ordered in 1992 and
delivered last year. Industrial disputes at the shipyard last summer also
depressed sales.
However, HHI, which is seeking a listing on the Seoul bourse, remains the
subsidiary with the largest profits in the Hyundai group.
Hyundai Precision &amp; Industry, the world's leading container manufacturer,
had a loss of Won48.9bn in 1993 against a profit of Won5.5bn in 1992 due to
a drop in exports. Sales, however, increased by 6.3 per cent to Won1,340bn.
Inchon Iron &amp; Steel had a 20.5 per cent fall in profits to Won11.5bn,
although sales rose by 18 per cent to Won1,083bn. It blamed the earnings
decline on a rise in the international prices for scrap steel.
Hyundai Pipe, the nation's largest steel pipe maker, had a loss of Won4.9bn
against a profit of Won1.2bn in 1992. It blamed the earnings drop on price
competition from manufacturers in developing nations. Sales increased by 24
per cent to Won321bn.
Hyundai Wood Industries, a timber and furniture company, had a loss of
Won4.5bn against a profit of Won1.9bn in 1992. Sales rose by 22.6 per cent
to Won397bn. Keum-Kang Development, an owner of department stores and
hotels, took a loss of Won4.9bn against a profit of Won3bn in 1992.

Hudson's Bay, Canada's biggest department store group, kept up the pace of
recovery in the final quarter of fiscal 1994 with a 3.4 per cent improvement
in revenues to CDollars 1.8bn (USDollars 1.3bn), and net profit up 12 per
cent to CDollars 103.8m, or CDollars 1.90 a share, from CDollars 92.2m, or
CDollars 1.83, a year earlier.
At the operating level, the Bay stores improved profit sharply and the
Zellers discount chain continued to gain strength. Zellers is now the
biggest segment of the Bay's business.
For the full year ended January 31, revenues were up 5.6 per cent to
CDollars 5.4bn and net profit was CDollars 147.7m, or CDollars 2.72 a share,
against CDollars 116.7m, or CDollars 2.32, including a CDollars 8.3m special
gain. The company said that in spite of heavy retail competition, the Bay
was well positioned to continue the better trend in profits.
However, Wal-mart of the US has just entered the Canadian market by buying
120 Woolco discount stores and will become a direct competitor of Zellers.
The Bay declared a quarterly dividend 23 cents a share, up 15 per cent,
payable on April 30 to shareholders of record on April 8.
The dividends will be paid to UK and US shareholders at CDollars 2.037 to
the pound and CDollars 1.357 to the US dollar.

south-east Asia and the Middle East, Reuter reports from Geneva.
'We intend to move closer to our customers by building more overseas
production sites,' said Mr Se Yung Chung, chairman of Hyundai Motor.
The company has already announced ambitious plans to become one of the
world's top 10 car producers by the end of the century. 'I can say that our
expansion projects are now under full swing,' said Mr Chung.
Hyundai Motor currently produces 1.25m cars a year, 1.15m in Korea and

James Hardie, the Australian building materials group, is to float its
Hardie Technologies subsidiary, which manufactures printed circuit board
assemblies and distributes electronic components, writes Nikki Tait in
Sydney. The Melbourne-based company is expected to have revenues of around
Adollars 70m (USdollars 33m) in the year to end-March. Flotation details are
being finalised, but Hardie said that the disposal was part of its strategy
of shedding non-core investments.

The Malaysian bourse regulator announced new rules for share dealings,

The Securities Commission chairman, Mr Munir Majid, said 10 new rules would
serve as 'minimum standards of business conduct for all securities

Korea Electric Power (Kepco), the state-controlled electricity company,
reported net earnings for 1993 down 45 per cent to Won419bn (Dollars 347m),
but sales up 12 per cent to Won7,525bn, writes John Burton.
In spite of the earnings drop, Kepco had the largest profits among the
country's listed companies. It is also the biggest capitalised company on
the Seoul bourse.
Kepco blamed the lower profits on increased expenses, including power plant
construction, while electricity charges remained unchanged.

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
International Paper's shares continued to fall in New York yesterday, a day
after the company told securities analysts that first-quarter results would
be below expectations.
The company, which benefited through much of 1993 from price increases in
its primary product line, uncoated sheet paper, is suffering from heavy
discounting this quarter, analysts said.
Wall Street had been projecting first-quarter earnings of about 75 cents per
share. Ms Evadna Lynn, analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds, said those
estimates were being adjusted to between 65 and 70 cents.
International Paper reported earnings of Dollars 100m, or 81 cents per
share, in the fourth quarter of 1993.
Its stock, which fell 4 per cent, or Dollars 2 3/4 , on Wednesday, was a
further Dollars 1 3/4 lower at Dollars 69 3/4 by midday yesterday.
Ms Lynn estimated that prices for uncoated printing papers have dropped
Dollars 40 per ton from the fourth-quarter highs, erasing about half the
price gains of the first three quarters.
Moreover, price increases for linerboard and corrugated boxes, scheduled for
this spring, would be difficult to implement quickly, she said.

<TEXT>
Grumman, which agreed on Monday to a Dollars 1.9bn cash bid from fellow
defence contractor Martin Marietta, had only recently broken off months of
merger discussions with Northrop, the California-based fighter aircraft
manufacturer, it has emerged.
Documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed that as
late as February 25 Northrop chief executive Mr Kent Kresa wrote to Grumman
saying it was prepared to submit a bid of not less than Dollars 50 a share,
if invited.
'We would also be prepared to consider an offer at a higher level, if
warranted, based on any additional information or analysis you may wish to
provide us,' the letter added.
However, on March 1 Grumman advised Northrop it was no longer interested in
pursuing talks and a week later agreed to a Dollars 55 a share cash offer
from Martin Marietta.
Northrop, in its negotiations, had said it preferred a transaction that
minimised the amount of cash involved.

FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: Canadian waste company up 8%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Philip Environmental, which has built a leading position in North American
industrial waste management in four years, reported 1993 net profit of
CDollars 19.7m (USDollars 14.5m), or 60 cents a share, up 8 per cent from
CDollars 18.3m, or 60 cents, on fewer shares in 1992.
Revenues jumped 61 per cent to CDollars 253m because of acquisitions.
Fourth-quarter profit was CDollars 7.9m, or 23 cents a share, against
CDollars 5m, or 16 cents, on sales of CDollars 112m against CDollars 42m.
Philip, controlled by Toronto's Fracassi brothers and 10 per cent held by St
Lawrence Cement, eastern Canada's biggest cement producer, has completed an
acquisition spree that doubled its asset base to CDollars 700m.
Philip went public in 1991 and swiftly bought up 20 companies in Canada for
nearly CDollars 300m. Late in 1993 a USDollars 120m financing enabled it to
buy two US recycling companies. Now 40 per cent of revenues come from the
US.
Philip is Canada's biggest recycler of commercial and industrial waste and a
leading US recycler of hazardous waste. It also operates an environmental
consulting business. It supplies waste oil to St Lawrence as a fuel for its
cement kilns.
Mr Alan Fracassi, president, said Philip was now consolidating and would
cope with its high debt level of about CDollars 300m. Revenues in 1994 are
expected to reach about CDollars 400m, and Philip's long-term ambition is to
become number three in North American waste management.

FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: US commercial banks feel the
chill of cost-cutting - Richard Waters examines the pressures which drove
Fleet Financial to implement a tough job reduction programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the US financial services jungle, commercial banks that harbour excessive
costs are liable to get eaten. That fear yesterday drove Fleet Financial,
one of New England's biggest banks, to announce plans to slash its workforce
by 5,500 - more than a quarter of the total 21,000 - by the end of next
year.
Fleet's cost-cutting programme may be the most radical yet attempted, but it
echoes efforts already under way at other banks. Aware that they face little
income growth in the US, many have also turned to expense reduction as the
primary means of lifting earnings this year and next.
There is plenty to be done. At nearly 1.5m last year, the number of people
employed in Federally-insured banks in the US was only around 80,000 less
than a decade before, when employment hit its peak. The automation of
banking operations and mergers between banks since the mid-1980s were meant
to make the industry more efficient, but have had little apparent effect;
the average cost/income ratio at most banks last year was around 63 per
cent, similar to the mid-1980s.
Adding to the pressure is competition from a burgeoning array of non-bank
institutions. Operating costs at GE Capital - the financial arm of General
Electric and the institution eyed by most senior US bankers as their most
threatening non-bank competitor - stood at around 56 per cent of revenues
(after interest costs) last year.
Companies like GE have brought to the financial services industry a new
lost-cost attitude, honed in a tough industrial operating environment in the
1980s, says a senior executive at one of the large New York-based banks. As
a result, banks have lost ground to lower-cost producers in everything from
leasing to credit cards.
For Fleet, the pressure to cut costs is more pressing than most. Its
expenses stand at 66 per cent of income - a ratio that looks increasingly
out of line with the most efficient commercial banks. Citicorp, for
instance, has already dragged its costs down from 70 per cent to 56 per cent
of income, and has its eye set on the magical 50 per cent barrier.
The drastic moves announced yesterday mark a belated attempt by Fleet to
vault back into the ranks of the industry's most efficient institutions. By
the late-1980s, the Rhode Island-based bank had forced costs to below 60 per
cent of income, making it a leader among US banks. Its takeover of the
failed Bank of New England in 1991, though, pushed the ratio back up to 72
per cent. Subsequent cost-cutting has failed to bring it back
Adding to Fleet's sense of urgency now is the fact that it is top of many
banks's takeover lists. With New England recovering from a prolonged
economic slump, Fleet would be a prize for any bank seeking a foothold in
the prosperous north-east corner of the country. The bank's name has been
linked with the acquisitive North Carolina-based NationsBank, among others.
For its part, Fleet says that it would prefer a merger with a bank of
roughly equal size.
Time may be running out. On Wednesday, the House banking committee voted
overwhelmingly for an interstate banking bill that would eventually abolish
restrictions on banks branching across state lines or taking over
institutions in other states. The US Senate has already backed a similar
bill, making legislation this year probable.
These changes will make the takeover market more competitive. NationsBank,
for instance, is currently constrained by a banking compact which prevents
banks based in the south-east from making big acquisitions elsewhere in the
US. They will also reduce the costs of banks which operate in more than one
state, further ratcheting down the cost bases of the best and biggest in the
industry.
In apparent recognition of this, Fleet has made its own cost targets
steadily more ambitious. Last summer, when it first announced plans to cut
expenses, the bank said it was aiming for a cost/income ratio of 60 per cent
by the end of 1994. Yesterday, it set the target at 55 per cent by the end
of 1995, to be achieved by cutting costs by Dollars 300m and increasing
revenues by Dollars 50m.
If achieved, it will represent a rapid pay-back on the costs of the
restructuring. Last year, Fleet set aside Dollars 125m for the anticipated
costs, and yesterday added Dollars 25m to this.

<TEXT>
YPF, Argentina's leading oil and natural gas concern, has reported a surge
in profits for 1993, due mainly to improvements in downstream operations.
The net profit of Dollars 706m compared with Dollars 256m in 1992, with
sales totalling Dollars 3.96bn against Dollars 3.87bn.
The higher margins, spurred chiefly by investments in refining and
marketing, offset the fall in crude prices to about Dollars 15 per barrel
from Dollars 19 at the start of 1993.
Extraordinary charges were also sharply down last year, totalling Dollars
43m compared with Dollars 155m in 1992.
YPF said it would propose a Dollars 387m special dividend for the Argentine
government, which owns a 20.2 per cent stake in the company, as well as a
cash dividend of Dollars 282m for other shareholders.
The government sold most of its stock to private investors in an
international public offering last year.
YPF has set an upstream budget of Dollars 974m in 1994, up from Dollars 530m
last year. The company plans to spend Dollars 249m on downstream operations
in 1994 compared with 1993 levels of Dollars 117m.
It also intends to raise in 1994 crude production to 138m barrels, up from
107m in 1993.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Trelleborg, the troubled Swedish mining and metals group, yesterday reported
a pre-tax loss of SKr1.52bn (Dollars 190m) in 1993, a slight improvement on
a loss of SKr1.56bn in 1992 which the group said presaged a return to profit
in 1994.
The company, which has been undergoing radical restructuring after being
badly hit by falling world metals prices, said its turnround programme of
cost cutting and disposals had significantly strengthened its financial
position.
Meanwhile, the weakness of the Swedish krona was giving a positive effect
after heavy foreign currency losses in 1992 and early-1993. If metal prices
did not worsen and an upward trend in its industrial operations continued,
the group would return to a 'positive result' this year, Trelleborg said.
Group sales in 1993 were SKr21.9bn, down from SKr23.6bn in 1992, while
operating losses rose to SKr326m from SKr186m in 1992.
But Trelleborg stressed it was reaping the benefits of restructuring
measures taken last year. It raised SKr1.3bn through the sale of Munksjo, a
paper and packaging company, and SKr900m from the sale of the group's stake
in Svedala, a materials handling company, taking proceeds from divestments
to more than SKr3.6bn over the year. It also raised SKr1.14bn in a rights
issue.
As a result, the balance sheet sank to SKr21.5bn from SKr25.7bn.

Spectrum Information Technologies and Mr John Sculley, the US company's

resignation.
No details were announced. In a joint statement, the mobile data
communications company and Mr Sculley, the former chairman and chief
executive of Apple Computer, said: 'Speculation created by the repetition of
charges and counter charges is not serving any useful purpose.'
Mr Sculley resigned after less than four months with the company. He sued
Spectrum's president, Mr Peter Caserta, charging that he had hidden the
company's financial and regulatory problems. Spectrum, currently under
investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, countered by suing
Sculley for breach of contract.

FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: Trelleborg to cut stake as
Falconbridge makes issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Trelleborg, the Swedish metals group, is expected to cut substantially its
50 per cent interest in Falconbridge as part of a planned public share issue
by the Canadian base metals producer.
The size and terms of the issue are currently under discussion. However,
industry sources suggested that Falconbridge, which is at present owned
equally by Trelleborg and Noranda, the Canadian resources group, will seek
to raise at least CDollars 500m (USDollars 369m) in new equity.
Noranda said yesterday that it intended to maintain roughly its current
stake by subscribing for 45 to 50 per cent of the issue. But Trelleborg, in
a separate announcement, said that the two present shareholders' interest in
Falconbridge would drop to about 75 per cent.
Falconbridge is the western world's second biggest nickel producer, with six
nickel-copper mines near Sudbury, Ontario, a refinery in Norway, and a
ferro-nickel mining and metallurgical complex in the Dominican Republic. The
Kidd Creek zinc and copper complex in northern Ontario comprises another
large slice of Falconbridge's assets.
Falconbridge will use the proceeds of the public offering mainly to help
finance three large projects, namely, the Collahuasi copper property in
Chile, in which it has a one-third stake; the Raglan nickel-copper
development in northern Quebec; and the Nickel Rim project near Sudbury.
The company is also hoping to acquire another one-third stake in Collahuasi
presently held by the Royal Dutch Shell group. The remaining third is owned
by Minorco, the international resources arm of South Africa's Anglo American
group.
Noranda said that it would use existing financial resources and credit
facilities to finance its share of the proposed Falconbridge issue, and that
there would be no material increase in its debt burden.
