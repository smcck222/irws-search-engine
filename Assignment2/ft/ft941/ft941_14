FT  10 MAR 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Hard sell for a new
British cheese - Churnton's confident launch into the mass market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You can almost hear the hoots of derision from across the Channel at the
news that 'an exciting new British cheese' was launched this week. Yet,
after the much-publicised demise of Lymeswold, the imitation blue Brie, the
marketing experts are convinced they have got it right this time.
The Cheese Company, formerly Express Foods and Britain's biggest independent
cheese manufacturer, is oozing confidence. It has spent about Pounds 500,000
developing Churnton - whose name is supposed to conjure up homely images of
traditional cheese-making - and is splashing out Pounds 2.5m on a saturation
campaign of television and magazine advertising, mail shots and in-store
tastings.
Churnton is a hard cheese, made to a secret recipe in the company's creamery
in Malpas, Cheshire. It looks like a cheddar but with an open texture, and
has a fairly strong flavour. Unlike new, specialist farmhouse cheeses,
Churnton is aimed unashamedly at the mass of consumers who buy mild or
medium cheddar for everyday use.
The cheese is being launched first in north-west England, where 18 per cent
of households are 'heavy users' of hard cheeses, and will go national early
next year.
The initial six-week TV campaign began last night with a 30-second
advertisement in the middle of Coronation Street, featuring Victoria Studd,
the popular television presenter, pronouncing: 'After one taste, you'll turn
to Churnton.'
The sales line sprang from the success of trial tastings in Safeway stores
across the country, in which eight out of 10 people said they would buy
Churnton again. It is deliberately packaged to look like an ordinary
cheddar, so 'the trick is getting people to taste it in the first place',
says Maria Dooley, marketing manager.
Price will be important at this end of the market. Churnton will sell at a
slight premium to mild or medium cheddar, but the company has opted for
fixed weight packs starting at 99p for 200g. 'When buying variable weight
packs of cheese, people fish around for the ones that are below Pounds 1,'
says Dooley.
It might seem a gamble to target a new brand at a market which is 85 per
cent dominated by supermarket own-label cheeses, roughly the reverse of
France, where branded regional cheeses abound and the retailing sector is
more fragmented.
Roger Davenport, managing director, explains that 'the relative lack of
branding in the UK is a result of the great success of major supermarket
chains and their drive towards own label'.
But any desire the supermarkets may have for innovation is stymied by
conservative British tastes. Despite the range of hand-made and imported
cheeses on offer, cheddar and other hard cheeses account for more than 75
per cent of sales. That is why Churnton is designed to be familiar, 'while
offering advantages in taste and texture,' he says.
The Cheese Company, which was bought out by its management from Grand
Metropolitan for Pounds 96m only 16 months ago, believes there is room for
growth in the Pounds 1.1bn UK market, of which it expects Churnton to
capture about 2 per cent. British cheese consumption is rising by 1-2 per
cent a year but is still only half that of continental Europe, and a third
of France.
Churnton, according to the launch publicity, is the first British cheese to
be developed for the regular, weekly shopper in more than 50 years.
With weary determination, Davenport fields comparisons with Lymeswold, which
was withdrawn in 1992 a decade after a triumphal start. He says Lymeswold
raised such expectations that the manufacturer, Dairy Crest, could not meet
them and began delivering a product that was not up to initial standards.
'Unlike Churnton, they didn't get much repeat purchasing,' he says. 'Whereas
ours is very much mainstream, Lymeswold was always, however successful,
going to be a niche product.'
Davenport is adamant that the cheese will not be found bland by its target
consumers. There is at least one auspicious sign. When Lymeswold was
launched, Peter Walker, then agriculture minister, was seen on television
feeding chunks of it to his dog Bomba. Gillian Shephard, the present
incumbent, does not have a dog.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Sex, sense and
sensibilities - A look at the changes in social attitudes behind a rise in
complaints about sexism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Slapped wrists for UK advertisers accompanied the revelation this week that
concern about sexist advertisements appears to be rising. According to the
Advertising Standards Authority's annual report, complaints from the public
about the portrayal of women climbed from 180 in 1992 to 536 last year,
while the number of complaints that were upheld more than doubled from 52 to
111. There is a 'need for greater sensitivity over the use of sex and women
in advertisements', the ASA warned.
But are advertisers really getting worse in their treatment of sex and
women? The indiscriminate use of semi-clad women draped across car bonnets,
or pouting from double-glazing advertisements, for example, seems to be less
common than it once was.
An alternative explanation for the increase in complaints could be the
sharpening of public sensibilities on such issues. According to Caroline
Crawford, ASA head of media relations, a 1980 survey conducted by the
authority showed that women were far more offended by the advertising of
sanitary products than by the sexist advertising that was around at the
time.
A decade later, about one in three women 'felt a degree of animosity about
the demeaning portrayal of women,' says Crawford. The figure for men (who by
this date had also been included in the survey) was about one in five.
'Still the majority weren't that bothered, but those who were bothered were
very bothered. It was an increasingly vocal group,' she says.
The increased use of nudity in recent years may also be a factor. While not
necessarily tasteless, sexist, or irrelevant to the product, it is still
likely to offend a few people.
The current Wonderbra poster campaign is hard to miss and has drawn about 30
complaints to the ASA so far. However, there are no plans to investigate,
says Crawford. The posters are of 'a confident woman of the 1990s who is
very aware of her sexuality and is certainly not a victim,' she says.
Likewise, the recent Haagen-Dazs ads, which showed a couple in various
states of undress enjoying ice cream, was considered by the ASA to be
tastefully photographed and sensitively handled. Even, says Crawford, 'if it
couldn't be said to be completely relevant' to the product, the treatment
probably would not offend the majority of people.
Rita Clifton, director of strategic planning at advertising agency Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi, agrees that nudity in advertising has increased: 'We're not as
uptight about showing naked bodies - they are now an acceptable public
currency for many. What is not acceptable any more - if indeed it ever was -
is portraying a woman as a victim, a stupid partner or somehow not in
control of her own destiny.'
On the whole the ad industry has to toe the line. There are no inflexible
rules - either for printed advertisements, governed by the ASA, or
television commercials, supervised by the Independent Television Commission
 -about which bits of the human body may or may not be shown. Instead,
advertisers have a general duty not to cause offence; how that is
interpreted in each case depends on the context, treatment and innuendo.
For example, a lingerie advertisement from Scandinavian retailer Hennes,
which showed no more cleavage than the Wonderbra advertisement, did fall
foul of the ASA. The strapline on the poster read: 'What the au pair will be
wearing this winter.' Says Crawford: 'Men wrote in and said 'I employ an au
pair and I object to the implication that all an au pair is good for is to
act as a man's plaything'.' What the public does object to, she adds, is
'inept and sexist innuendo' rather than sex itself.
Humour may be the salvation of an advertisement, even if the context for
nudity is questionable. The ITC let a Danepak bacon ad off the hook, in
spite of complaints, because it was judged 'comic rather than voyeuristic'.
The advertisement showed a family of nudists cooking bacon and giving thanks
that the low-fat product was less likely to spit in the pan than other
bacons.
The trade press continues to present problems for the ASA, particularly
those journals with a predominantly male readership. According to Crawford,
there are still ads around with line drawings of buxom women and strap-lines
which say, for example, 'Free sex' and then go on to say 'Now we've got your
attention lads, come and buy our motorbikes.'
The authority got into a scrap last year with a farming publication over an
ad for paper sacks. A 'page three girl', says Crawford, was used,
irrelevantly, to advertise the sacks. Two complaints, one from a man and one
from a woman, were upheld. The publication and the company then started
lobbying farmers and the ASA was accused of being a kill-joy and guilty of
political correctness. 'You try explaining to a farmer the concept of
sexism,' comments Crawford, who has some experience as a member of a farming
family herself.
Rita Clifton at Saatchi questions whether this kind of advertising actually
works - whether it is aimed at men or women. 'Clearly, advertising needs to
grab people's attention. The problem is that if you show a lithe 18-year-old
in a jock strap, quite often that will be the only thing that's recalled by
women,' she says. Unless the product and the figure are properly integrated,
the product may go unnoticed.
The mention of jock straps raises the question of whether men are these days
as likely as women to be victims of sexist advertising. At the very least
they may be the victims of stereotyping, as an article in the current issue
of She magazine points out. Entitled 'Why the man-bashing has to stop', it
lists the current advertising campaigns which portray men as 'ranging from
dim and uncouth, to pushy and insensitive,' and argues that the campaigns
have little appeal to women because 'women do not want to see old sexist
values simply reversed'.
There have been complaints about men and sex in ads - the ASA annual report,
for example, details the case of the recent Britvic orange juice
advertisement showing a man with wings holding a magic wand and wearing a
posing pouch. The strapline read 'Somehow we manage to cram in 12 oranges'.
There were 35 complaints that the ad was offensive but the ASA ruled that
'most readers would appreciate the humour of the image'.
To date, however, Crawford cannot recall a complaint about men in ads having
been upheld - perhaps that awaits yet another shift in public sensitivities.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Dorrell to aid investment flow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, yesterday raised
the prospect of alterations to the tax structure to improve the flow of
funds from savings to investment.
Speaking at a Confederation of British Industry seminar, Mr Dorrell set out
the objectives of his review of savings and the movement of funds through
the economy, announced by the chancellor last summer.
The purpose of the review is to examine the relationship between savings and
investment and to ask how best to allocate capital efficiently within the
economy.
'We need to consider the extent to which we are prepared to use the tax
system to encourage a wider menu of options for financing business,' said Mr
Dorrell.
In his speech to CBI members he highlighted a number of areas of weakness in
the economy. These included:
Manufacturing accounts for a relatively small share of economic activity.
The medium-size business sector is relatively undeveloped, particularly
compared with Germany.
There is evidence that it is difficult to raise significant amounts of
capital for high-tech start-ups in Britain.
Dividend payout ratios appear to be relatively high in the UK,
The financial secretary said the review needed to ask how well institutional
shareholders - which play a crucial role in capital markets - functioned.
Investors in the venture capital trusts, announced in the November Budget,
will be allowed tax relief on up to Pounds 100,000 a year, under proposals
in a government consultative document.
Published yesterday, the document suggests the trusts should be taxed and
structured in a broadly similar way to investment trusts.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Brynn Davies, for 16 years chairman of Mid Glamorgan Health Authority,
will not have his contract renewed this summer after a report highlighting
serious management failures.
The Commons committee on the parliamentary commissioner for administration
(the ombudsman) was told yesterday of his repeated failure to act on
complaints. The decision was made by Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary.
Mr John Wyn Owen, a member of the National Health Service management
executive for Wales, told the committee action was being taken to improve
matters. In January Mr Davies apologised to the committee for the treatment
of the relatives of patients who tried for 18 months in vain to see a
consultant.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Court to rule on councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The High Court will decide tomorrow on applications by three local
authorities for judicial review of the Local Government Commission's
proposals for council reorganisation in north-east England.
A government decision on the area has already been delayed. The commission
said it had failed to consider about 500 letters from local interests that
were sent before the closing date for consultation. As a result an
unprecedented supplementary report on the area will be published.
It seems unlikely, however, that the supplementary report will make
significant changes to the recommendations.
Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, must wait until the commission's
reports are complete before announcing any decisions on the area. If the
appeal for judicial review is successful the process could be further
delayed.
Humberside and North Yorkshire county councils, and Ryedale, a district in
North Yorkshire, are all dissatisfied with recommendations which would see
the creation of five all-purpose unitary councils north of the Humber in
place of the current two-tier system.
They say the commission failed to consider properly the possibility of
maintaining the two-tier status quo, and to carry out proper consultations.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Beef ban threat hits meat trade
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
German threats to impose a ban on British beef imports because of fears over
'mad cow' disease (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) had already had
'disastrous' effects on the meat trade for at least one company, Mrs Gillian
Shephard, agriculture minister, said yesterday.
She is preparing a dossier for her German counterparts on the effect of
renewed publicity over BSE on meat exports.
Germany has called for a special session of EU health ministers to discuss a
ban on British beef imports. Mrs Shephard said she hoped the Germans would
withdraw their request because it was not supported by any other EU country.
The German health ministry said yesterday it would take no unilateral action
to ban British beef if the meeting could prove that no risks were involved
in importing meat which may be contaminated with BSE.

FT  10 MAR 94 / NUM in ballot on new structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Union of Mineworkers yesterday started balloting its Yorkshire
members over merger plans which, if defeated, would spell the end for the
union's structure, Richard Donkin writes.
A close vote could bring into question Mr Arthur Scargill's presidency,
although those campaigning against the executive admitted yesterday that
such an outcome was unlikely.
The merger vote has been brought to a head because the NUM, which had
245,000 members in 1982, has about 8,000 members, nearly 6,000 of whom work
in the Yorkshire area.
This has led to rationalisation plans including the takeover of the
Yorkshire area's Pounds 5.8m assets to help ease the union's financial
crisis.
A ballot is necessary to achieve the merger because of the NUM's federal
structure.

The chairman of a Welsh health authority has been sacked for his repeated
failure to act on complaints, a committee of MPs was told yesterday.
Mr Brynn Davies, who for 16 years was chairman of Mid Glamorgan Health
Authority, the biggest in Wales, will not have his contract renewed when it

Mr John Wyn Owen, a member of the National Health Service management

Mr Davies has appeared before a Commons committee twice in three years - the
last time six weeks ago when MPs discussed a report on the way the authority
handled complaints about the death of a 62-year-old man.
The authority has previously caused controversy by failing to tell patients
that a doctor died of Aids until five months after his death, and
allegations that consultants at Merthyr had charged patients for using NHS
facilities.
In January Mr Davies apologised to the committee for the treatment of
relatives of patients who had tried in vain to see a consultant for 18
months.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Tories on attack over local tax: Curry's claim to undercut
Labour council charges by average Pounds 129 disputed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservative party yesterday signalled that it will place what it claims
are the high levels of council tax levied by Labour-controlled authorities
at the forefront of its campaign for May's local council elections.
At the party's first campaign news conference for the elections, Mr David
Curry, local government minister, unveiled figures suggesting that nine of
the 10 highest council taxes levied in the next financial year would be in
Labour councils.
He also said that, of the 10 lowest taxes, five would be levied by
Conservative controlled councils, including Westminster, Wandsworth and
Ealing.
But Labour said he had chosen an invalid base of comparison, by assessing
every council on the tax charged to households in band C - which applies to
properties valued between Pounds 52,000 and Pounds 68,000.
Figures from the Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities
showed that 82 per cent of households in Liverpool, which has the most
expensive band C tax, lived in properties below the band C threshold, and
would therefore pay less than the amount quoted by Mr Curry.
In Westminster, with the lowest band C tax, 84 per cent of households are in
properties valued above Pounds 68,000, and would therefore pay more.
Mr Curry said that the government had been officially notified of the
precise levels of council tax to be levied by about 300 of the 419 local
authorities in England and Wales. He said that the figures showed that on
average councils were levying tax increases of 2.7 per cent in the band C
range.
Although the survey is not complete, this is nearly 4 percentage points
below the amount that the government predicted last autumn, when announcing
its grant settlement for 1994-95, and may reflect the determination of
councils to contain taxes in an election year.
Mr Curry said that on the information the government had received Labour
councils would charge Pounds 129 more on average in council tax next year
than Conservative councils. He said that larger council tax bills were often
levied by councils - such as Lambeth, Tower Hamlets and Islington - which
already receive above average grants from central government.
Mr Curry said: 'What we can demonstrate is that we can provide better value
for money and provide better services.'
Mr Jack Straw, shadow local government minister, said that Mr Curry's
figures were 'unconvincing'.
He said: 'You can't trust the Tories to tell the truth on tax, whether it's
on VAT, personal allowances or council tax. They cannot resist twisting the
truth.'

FT  10 MAR 94 / Balfour wins rail link work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Balfour Beatty Civil Engineering yesterday won the Pounds 60m main contract
to build the underground stations and tunnels for the Heathrow Express
project, Paul Betts writes.
The Pounds 300m joint project by BAA, the privatised airports group, and
British Rail is to construct an express rail link between Heathrow and the
centre of London.
The service, scheduled to start operating in December 1997, will mean that
the world's busiest international airport can be reached from Paddington
Station in 16 minutes. BAA said trains would run every 15 minutes.
The project would create 1,800 jobs during construction and a further 200
during operation, said Mr Rod Hoare, Heathrow Express managing director.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Building societies aim to shake off shackles: A look at the
controversy over the limits to their activities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even the largest building societies believe they should get a little extra
help from the government to compete effectively in the mortgage and savings
markets.
At its meeting today the Building Societies Association council will discuss
a paper on the current review of the 1986 legislation on building societies.
Announcing the review in January, Mr Anthony Nelson, the Treasury economic
secretary, highlighted for discussion areas such as the limit of 40 per cent
of funds which societies can raise on the wholesale markets; merger and
takeover procedures; and the process for societies to change their status.
The BSA, to which the Treasury has sub-contracted much of the consultation
process, believes the chance of a full review - with the ending of
legislative constraints on societies - should not be missed.
Mr Adrian Coles, association director-general, says some detailed changes it
would like could be done reasonably quickly as part of the de-regulation
initiative.
Mr Donald Kirkham, chief executive of Woolwich building society, the UK's
third largest, says: 'In fundamental terms, the only thing really pressing
down on building societies is the wholesale funding limit.'
Societies want greater access to wholesale funds, where borrowing is cheaper
at present, so they can offer more attractive deals to potential borrowers.
For much of last year they lost market share to the banks.
But for the medium term, the association would still like an end to
legislative limits on the powers of societies, except those needed to define
their mutual status.
One suggestion for defining mutuality, set out in an association paper about
18 months ago, is that a society should raise a set proportion of its funds
from its members and have a set proportion of its commercial assets as loans
to members.
Removing the existing constraints on what societies can do would inevitably
mean changes to the way they are regulated.
The paper was tactful enough to say it would prefer the Building Societies
Commission to remain the regulator, but acknowledged the argument for moving
supervision to the Bank of England as differences between banks and
societies diminish.
That prospect was raised by the Bank itself when Mr Brian Quinn, an
executive director, gave evidence to the influential Commons Treasury
committee of MPs last November.
Mr John Watts, the Tory chairman of the committee, says it will pursue this
issue when it takes evidence from the commission and the association during
its current inquiry into financial regulation.
There are also broader concerns at Westminster. Mr Alistair Darling,
Labour's City spokesman, says: 'The legislation should allow societies to
expand their activities.
'But I would be very reluctant to give them carte blanche to do whatever
they like.'
As Mr Coles puts it, the issue is one of efficiency: no matter how amenable
the Building Societies Commission has been, the need for changes in
societies' powers to be considered by parliament inevitably means delay.
He says: 'Building societies don't want the ability to lend in Bosnia and
Brazil.
'The change would allow us to do things in the markets where we operate in
the most efficient way possible.'
But others question whether societies are trying to seize an unfair
advantage, given the protected environment in which they exist and the lack
of shareholders to hold boards accountable.
Mr Peter Birch, chief executive of Abbey National, the former society which
converted to plc status in 1989, dismisses the argument that societies are
fully accountable to their members.
He says that most savers and borrowers do not see themselves as having a
controlling role in the society.
'When people go into a building society, they do so because the goods are
attractive, rather than to become members,' he says.
His comments seem borne out by members' involvement.
For example, at Halifax building society, the UK's largest, only about 10
per cent of its 5.5m voting members took part in decisions at last year's
annual general meeting.
Even at Nationwide, the second largest, where the running of the society
became such an issue that members insisted on a couple of their own
candidates becoming directors, only about 103,000 of the 3.5m voting members
were involved in voting for the board at last year's AGM.
Mr David Gilchrist, Halifax corporate development manager, describes the
society as 'happy to look at ways of improving accountability'.
But far from enhancing accountability, the most likely immediate changes
from the de-regulation initiative may reduce the prospects for internal
democracy, since they are directed at streamlining the occasions and ways
for societies to consult and notify their millions of members.
Society chief executives are reluctant to concede the point publicly, but
some privately admit that greater freedoms should be accompanied by more
accountability.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Court to rule on review of councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The High Court will decide tomorrow on applications by three local
authorities for judicial review of the Local Government Commission's
proposals for council re-organisation in north-east England.
A government decision on the area has already been delayed. The commission
said it had failed to consider about 500 letters from local interests that
were sent before the closing date for consultation. As a result an
unprecedented supplementary report on the area will be published.
It seems unlikely, however, that the supplementary report will make
significant changes to the recommendations.
Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, must wait until the commission's
reports are complete before announcing any decisions on the area. If the
appeal for judicial review is successful, the process could be further
delayed.
Humberside and North Yorkshire county councils, and Ryedale, a district
within North Yorkshire, are all dissatisfied with recommendations which
would see the creation of five all-purpose unitary councils north of the
Humber in place of the current two-tier system.
They say the commission failed to consider properly the possibility of
maintaining the two-tier status quo, and to carry out proper consultations.
The Labour-controlled Association of County Councils said it was 'concerned'
by the commission's 'worrying' mistake. It will instruct its members in
areas not yet reviewed to check that all submissions have been considered by
the commission.
The cross-party Association of District Councils, whose members include
Ryedale, discourages districts from resorting to judicial review, as the
process is costly and delays re-organisation.
Five counties - Avon, Cleveland, Derbyshire, Lancashire and Somerset - have
already been allowed to challenge commission decisions in the High Court.
The judicial reviews for Avon, Somerset and Cleveland will take place on May
23.
In the following two weeks the commission, which is working to a timetable
shortened by the government last September, must announce proposals for
re-organising Bedfordshire, Berkshire, Leicestershire, Oxfordshire,
Cambridgeshire, Suffolk, Staffordshire, Cheshire, Cumbria, Hampshire and
Devon.
Proposals for Kent and Devon may also be announced at the same time, if
severe local disagreements in both areas can be overcome.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Stress on jobless takes heavy toll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unemployed people are 75 per cent more likely to experience a marriage
break-up than those in work, says the most comprehensive survey of
employment and joblessness in Britain.
The four-year study, based on 6,000 individuals in six towns, found that in
spite of experiencing multiple deprivations the unemployed are not becoming
a culturally distinct 'underclass'.
It also found that they are flexible in the work they are prepared to
undertake and have only modest pay expectations.
Almost all unemployed individuals are considerably worse off on benefits
than in work - but married women are more likely to give up work when
husbands become unemployed because of benefits rules.
The survey covered Aberdeen, Coventry, Kirkcaldy, Northampton, Rochdale and
Swindon. It is part of the Social Change and Economic Life Initiative funded
by the Economic and Social Research Council. It is published today in the
book Social Change and the Experience of Unemployment (Oxford University
Press). Average labour costs in manufacturing are lower in the UK than
southern Italy, one of the poorest regions of the European Union, says a
report published by the Low Pay Unit yesterday.
But the research group says the UK's success in creating jobs has been much
less than in countries with higher levels of employment and social
protection.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Mercury to spend Pounds 200m on network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercury, the main rival to British Telecommunications in the UK, will today
announce a Pounds 200m upgrading programme aimed at increasing its capacity
to compete in the provision of advanced telecoms services.
The investment in 'intelligent networks' technology will give Mercury one of
the most advanced networks in Europe, able to offer new features such as
corporate phone 'meetings'.
The main contractor is DSC, a fast-growing US supplier specialising in
intelligent networks technology, which is installing similar systems for
several US regional Bell companies. Other contractors include Northern
Telecom, the Canadian supplier, and GPT, the UK-based joint venture between
General Electric Company and Siemens, the German group.
Investment for the first year is expected to approach Pounds 20m, with new
services coming on stream as early as next year.
Cable &amp; Wireless, Mercury's parent company, intends to spread the technology
to other operators under its control, including Hong Kong Telecom. DSC
already has a contract with Optus, the main rival to the former state
monopoly in Australia, which is part-owned by C&amp;W.
'Intelligent networks' are sophisticated signalling and computer systems
giving operators the power to route calls and programme local exchanges
without having to install software and hardware at each exchange. They also
offer operators large efficiency and reliability gains.
The investment underlines C&amp;W's long-term commitment to Mercury, despite its
avowed intention to concentrate future investment in the Asia-Pacific
region.
It also points the way to future competition between operators not just on
price, as now, but also on the range of sophistication of services, as in
the US.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Labour attacks Major over inflation 'rift'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday seized on remarks about inflation by the prime minister and
the deputy governor of the Bank of England to claim that the two were
'completely at odds'.
Mr John Major said yesterday that inflation was 'under lock and key'. Mr
Rupert Pennant-Rea said it was 'a delusion' to think that Britain had
defeated inflation.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said: 'The prime minister should
clarify his precise inflation target and whether he intends to meet it.'
Mr Pennant-Rea told the Institute of Credit Management national conference:
'It is tempting to feel that Britain has won the war against inflation, so
we can now afford to relax. That is a delusion, and a dangerous one too.'
Underlying inflation, which excludes mortgage payments, was 2.8 per cent in
January, still in the top half of the government's 1 per cent to 4 per cent
target range. The Bank said in its inflation report, published in February,
that the underlying rate would remain in the top half of the range
throughout 1995, and there was an 'asymmetric risk' it would move higher.
Mr Pennant-Rea said: 'We have to keep inflation down in order to sustain
growth. Monetary restraint is not a hair-shirt but it has to be a habit.
After all the unforced errors of the past it will take many years to prove
we have acquired it.'
Mr Major, speaking to businessmen in Portsmouth, was rather more upbeat
about inflation than Mr Pennant-Rea, but his comments about the UK's
economic prospects were in tune with those of the deputy governor.
The prime minister said: 'What I believe we are beginning to get is a
satisfactory platform for sustained recovery with low inflation.'
Mr Pennant-Rea said: 'The economy will soon enter its third year of
recovery, and the pace of that recovery is enough to have started reducing
unemployment. Meanwhile, inflation is low and the government's target is for
it to go lower still.'
Mr Pennant-Rea's speech marked a departure in tone from the customary solemn
phraseology of top Bank officials. In a candid passage about past mistakes
in monetary policy, he said: 'At the Bank of England we are merely part of
the supply lines. As such, we have the ability to mess things up - and our
record shows we have often used it.'

FT  10 MAR 94 / Open minister suffers brush with the truth: A look at the
aftermath of a verbal slip-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Mr William Waldegrave's judgment the turning point came early yesterday
morning. Emerging, still blinking with sleep, from the front door of his
London home he was met by a barrage of questions from waiting journalists.
'Are you going to resign, Mr Waldegrave?' shouted one. 'Why?' responded the
minister for public services and science. 'For telling the truth,' the
journalist yelled back.
Mr Waldegrave decided he could relax. The row about his public comments on
when governments might or might not consciously mislead parliament was
revealing itself as a media storm in a Westminster teacup.
Speaking a few hours later to the Social Market Foundation Mr Waldegrave was
careful not to blame the media. Instead he quoted Enoch Powell's dictum that
a politician who complains about the media is like a sailor who complains
about the sea: 'We amateur sailors often complain about the sea, but it does
us little good.'
An honest politician in a government which has not won many prizes for
giving straight answers, Mr Waldegrave spent the rest of the day in
television and radio studios explaining what he had originally said to a
Commons committee.
No, he had not suggested that it was proper for ministers to mislead
parliament. Instead, he had pointed to two occasions in the distant past on
which ministers had been economical with the truth about impending
devaluations of the pound.
The row rumbled on. Lord Callaghan protested that he had evaded
parliamentary questions but had never told a lie. Opposition politicians saw
another opportunity to pin the 'sleaze' label on an ever-embattled
government. Mr Waldegrave's enemies on the right wing of the Tory party saw
another opportunity to cast him as an inevitable victim of the next cabinet
reshuffle.
After all, he might well face considerable criticism in the report of the
Scott inquiry into arms-related exports to Iraq. Mr Major could offer him as
a convenient scapegoat.
But thoughtful colleagues believe sacking Mr Waldegrave in the summer would
be a mistake. He may not be the most guileful of politicians but he is an
intelligent one.
His donnish approach to politics is in refreshing contrast to the
instinctively combative approaches of Mr Michael Howard or Mr Kenneth
Clarke. And if he has never courted a constituency among backbench Tory MPs,
he does have the powerful support of Mr Douglas Hurd.
During regular appearances before select committees he conducts a genuine
dialogue with backbenchers, acknowledging the force of criticisms and
enjoying reasoned argument with those of contrary views. His handling of the
government's science policy has won him plaudits. His oversight of the
Citizen's Charter has made the best of a bad job.
This week he made a mistake. His desire to answer MPs' questions led him to
acknowledge a practice that every politician knows to be true but which few
ever admit. In more tranquil times no one would have noticed. But the media
pounces now on every slip - even, it seems, when the minister responsible
for open government tells the truth.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Waldegrave says he will not resign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr William Waldegrave yesterday said he had no intention of resigning as the
minister for public services and science over his comments that ministers
had to lie in exceptional circumstances.
But as the prime minister gave his public backing to his cabinet colleague,
Downing Street was forced on to the defensive by a request from Lord
Callaghan for Mr Waldegrave to 'clear my name'.
This was after Mr Waldegrave said the former Labour prime minister had told
untruths during the devaluation crisis of 1967.
Clearly angered by Mr Waldegrave's comments, Lord Callaghan emphasised that
he had chosen his words very carefully, but that he had never lied to the
Commons.
Comments later released on behalf of Mr Waldegrave sought to make it clear
that the minister had not criticised Lord Callaghan's actions.
The comments stressed that the former prime minister was working 'in
extremely difficult circumstances'. Mr Waldegrave 'specifically recognised
Mr Callaghan's difficulties and believed he behaved with propriety. If Lord
Callaghan now feels that Mr Waldegrave has impugned his integrity it is very
clear that is not the case.'
Downing Street described the devaluations under Labour governments in 1949
and 1967 as 'exceptional circumstances in unusual times'.
It was clear, however, that Mr John Major continued to believe ministers
'must be truthful and not mislead the Commons'.
Mr Waldegrave had pointed to two Labour chancellors, Lord Callaghan and Sir
Stafford Cripps, who had been forced to mislead the Commons in order to try
to prevent the devaluation of the pound.
Mr Major said: 'Mr Waldegrave answered an intelligent question frankly about
what had happened under another government a quarter of a century ago.' The
prime minister was asked on the BBC whether lying could be justified in
parliament. He replied: 'Nobody can and nobody does.'
Mr Waldegrave, asked by Jimmy Young on BBC Radio 2 whether he thought he was
going to keep his job, replied: 'That is entirely up to the prime minister.
If ministers are going to be fired for telling the truth, we are going to
get into a very difficult pickle.'
Mr Waldegrave later told his colleagues that he had no intention of
resigning.
Asked earlier if he had blundered by being too honest, he said: 'If the new
line of attack is to say we really don't want ministers to tell the truth on
these matters, we want ministers who give weasel words, I suppose I plead
guilty.'

FT  10 MAR 94 / Pay group raps failure to create jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Average labour costs in manufacturing are lower in the UK than southern
Italy, one of the poorest regions of the European Union, a report published
by the Low Pay Unit yesterday shows.
But it says the UK's success in creating jobs has been much less than
countries with a higher level of employment and social protection.
The research group said: 'Italy created proportionately six times as many
jobs as the UK between 1970 and 1992. Germany created almost four times as
many jobs and France created twice as many.'
De-regulation, it said, had not allowed the UK to create employment and it
had not delivered prosperity. 'It has helped to create a situation in which
40 per cent or more of the UK workforce are employed on a part-time,
temporary or casual basis, or are classed as freelance or self-employed.'
The unit said the UK was uncompetitive because productivity was low, pushing
unit labour costs to a level very much higher than the EU average. In part
the UK's low productivity was a result of long working hours and poor
conditions of employment.
Staff turnover and absenteeism were high by European standards and training
was poor. 'These factors were directly related to the low wages themselves,'
it said.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Auditors split on cap to liability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Medium-size accountancy firms yesterday started to fight back against the
campaign by their larger competitors to limit the exposure of auditors to
big litigation claims.
Mr Peter Douglas, national managing partner of Kidsons Impey, the UK's
12th-largest firm, said he was considering organising a group of mid-size
firms to object to proposals which would allow auditors to cap their
liability at a multiple of audit fees.
'I just find it difficult that auditors should be given some protection
against being negligent,' he said.
His comments follow the decision by the ruling council of the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales last week to support a paper in
favour of reform to be sent to the Department of Trade and Industry.
The institute is echoing a campaign being run by the UK's largest eight
accounting firms calling for removal of section 310 of the 1985 Companies
Act, which forbids auditors to negotiate any limit on their liability.
A number of partners from smaller firms have objected to the campaign as
being self-interested and serving the interests of the larger firms.
Mr Douglas, who joins the institute's council in June, said he had arranged
a meeting on the subject with Mr Neil Hamilton, minister for corporate
affairs at the DTI.
'The larger firms are not in the same market as the rest of us, and that is
because they have tried very hard to ensure we are not,' he said.
Mr Graham Ward, a partner with Price Waterhouse, has argued that part of the
case for reform is that executors of wills of deceased accountancy firm
partners were restricting payments to their widows and children because they
could not quantify the risk of future liabilities the estates might incur as
a result of litigation settlements.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Political Notebook: Inelegant and inevitable U-turn made on
Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two weeks ago the message was crystal clear. Britain had provided more than
its fair share of ground troops for Bosnia. If the United Nations needed
additional forces then it would fall to others - most notably the US - to do
their bit.
Just seven days ago the consensus within the cabinet remained opposed to
reinforcing the 2,000-strong British contingent in the former Yugoslav
province. Mr Douglas Hurd said so in untypically blunt terms in a newspaper
article. Now the government has reversed itself. It has decided it must lead
the international effort to give General Sir Michael Rose the additional
10,500 soldiers he wants to police the growing number of ceasefires in
Bosnia.
The cabinet is expected to approve later today the despatch of another 1,000
or so British soldiers. A few other countries will commit extra troops. But
by its own yardstick the British government will be doing a great deal more
than its fair share.
It has been an inelegant U-turn. It is fraught with political risks. If
there is anything approaching a consensus on the Tory backbenches it is
driven by the instinct that Britain should avoid deeper military
entanglement. Nor has the shift been without critics in the senior ranks of
the government.
No one in the cabinet - from the prime minister downwards - has been an
enthusiast for an enhanced military role. But over recent weeks four
distinct camps have emerged.
One, led by the prime minister, has been convinced by the case for more
muscular action on the ground to accompany the latest drive for a political
settlement. A second, including Mr Hurd, has gradually aligned itself with
that view.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind has headed a third group of more cautious ministers
arguing against extra troops until a broad political deal has been struck.
Finally, Mr Kenneth Clarke and, to a lesser extent, Mr Michael Heseltine
have put the case against further military involvement in almost any
circumstances.
The balance of power has been shifting constantly. But since Friday - when
Mr Major took a decision in principle to commit extra troops - the
initiative has passed decisively to the interventionist camp. The most
important element in the change of heart was the pledge offered to Mr Major
by President Bill Clinton to maintain US pressure on the Bosnian Moslems to
reach a political settlement. With the Russians applying similar pressure on
the Serbs and the Germans on the Croats, that held out a reasonable prospect
of an eventual end to the civil war.
It offered also a not-to-be-missed opportunity to draw a line under the
acrimonious disputes with Washington that have poisoned British-American
relations for more than a year. The change in the international environment
coincided with the success of General Rose in gradually extending the
ceasefire in Sarajevo to other areas.
That in turn opened up the possibility of a 'bottom-up' peace process - with
a series of regional truces providing additional momentum towards an overall
settlement.
Britain could hardly jeopardise the process for the sake of a few hundred
troops.
But the clinching factor in the new equation was the demand by General Rose
for additional British troops. Though he couched his public demands in terms
of the UN, he left no doubt that his first priority was for additional
experienced British soldiers.
Ministers, who had consistently stated that the government's military
strategy would be guided by the commanders, could hardly ignore warnings
that British forces were being 'stretched to breaking point'.
For most in the cabinet - with the exception of Mr Clarke - the case for
reinforcement has become irresistible. Mr Major will claim that Britain is
taking an important lead. But it was the force of circumstance which made
this latest U-turn as inevitable as it was inelegant.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Company-car drivers confess to sins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Company-car drivers are nearly twice as likely to break motorway speed
limits than private motorists. They also break speed limits on other main
roads more readily and admit to parking illegally more often.
This unflattering portrait of company-car drivers is set out in the latest
annual survey of the business-car community by polling organisation MORI and
Pragma Consulting. The survey was commissioned by Lex Vehicle Leasing, owned
by Lex Service and finance house Lombard North Central.
MORI's soundings among fleet managers about the differences between men and
women found that 'in general women are thought (by fleet managers) to be
better and safer drivers and that they look after their vehicles better'.
Younger fleet managers were more likely to feel that women made better
drivers.
More pertinent in terms of the costs incurred by companies on repairs and
insurance premiums, when asked 'Who in your organisation has most
accidents?', 43 per cent of the managers said men and 54 per cent saw little
difference. Only 4 per cent said women.
The survey concludes that the percentage of company cars, at 11.3 per cent
of the total, is higher than for several years and that the population has
increased by 50,000 in the past 12 months.
The average age of the cars has fallen from 2.8 years to 2.5 years in the
past 12 months, indicating that companies are increasing the replacement
rate. Mr John Walden, Lex Vehicle Leasing's managing director, sees this as
a sign that business confidence is improving.
He said: 'Companies make investment decisions, like replacing company
vehicles, when they are confident that the business climate is improving.
The survey results . . . clearly indicate a turnaround in business outlook'.
Only 1 per cent of company-car drivers surveyed said their companies were
phasing out company cars.
More than 4,000 stolen cars were offered for sale to dealers in the last
quarter of last year, reflecting a continuing surge in car-related crime and
fraud, according to HPI, the vehicle information tracking agency.
HPI also found last-quarter increases in vehicles written off by insurance
companies being repaired and re-offered for sale, and more cars being
offered for sale while still subject to hire-purchase agreements.
The agency makes about 3.5m vehicle-background checks a year for auction
houses and the motor trade.
Mr Brian Bailey, HPI's chairman, said part of the rise was likely to be
seasonal and related to financial pressures in the approach to Christmas.
But there was also a 'worrying underlying trend' driving the statistics
upwards.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Treasury stalls Tube gates deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Underground is attempting to win Treasury approval for a Pounds 4m
deal to lease automatic access gates for 12 of its busiest stations but has
yet to reach an agreement on the financing terms.
This is the second time within a month that a London Underground proposal to
bring in private finance to pay for investments has met Treasury objections.
A Pounds 500m deal to lease 100 trains for the Northern Line from ABB
Transportation has also run into difficulties with Treasury rules.
The latest deal involves a proposal from Westinghouse Cubic, a maker of
revenue collection and control systems, to supply automatic gates for busy
stations on the Underground including Harrow-on-the-Hill, Uxbridge,
Whitechapel, Hammersmith, Balham and Morden. The others are East Ham,
Edgware, Tooting Broadway, Gants Hill, Leyton and Plaistow.
Treasury talks are understood to have run into problems over the transfer of
risk to Westinghouse Cubic. The Underground is believed to have suggested
that payments be linked to the number of passengers using the stations, but
the Treasury wanted it tied to the success of the gates in reducing fraud.
London Underground said that if agreement on the leasing deal could not be
reached, it would fund the project from its own resources if forced to. It
was, however, hopeful of reaching Treasury agreement.
London Underground is keen to extend the use of gates to combat fraud, which
costs it Pounds 30m a year.
The government has attempted for several years to persuade the private
sector to finance public transport infrastructure schemes, but with only
limited success.
A private finance panel was set up last autumn to identify promising
projects and remove blockages to implementation.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Beef ban threat begins to hit trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
German threats to impose a ban on British beef imports because of fears over
'mad cow' disease (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) had already had
'disastrous' effects on the meat trade for at least one company, Mrs Gillian
Shephard, agriculture minister, said yesterday.
'It is having a disastrous effect on the company's trade with Germany and
affecting inquiries from elsewhere. I'm simply not having it,' she said.
Mrs Shephard is preparing a dossier for her German counterparts on the
effect of renewed publicity over BSE on meat exports.
Germany has called for a special session of European Union health ministers
this month to discuss a ban on British beef imports. Mrs Shephard said she
hoped the Germans would withdraw their request because it is supported by no
other EU member country.
Mr Mike Roper, export manager of Buchan Meats in Turriff, Aberdeenshire,
said business with Germany had fallen 15 per cent in the past year because
of renewed fears over BSE as well as the recession.
He said: 'We provide a guarantee that our beef is BSE-free, but this is a
popular issue in Germany and there is a lot of concern about it.'
Germany imported about 900,000 tonnes of beef last year, but only 1,000
tonnes was from Britain - less than 1 per cent of total British beef exports
to the EU. British beef exports to the EU - 126,000 tonnes last year - have
only begun to take off in recent years.
The German health ministry said yesterday it would take no unilateral action
to ban British beef if the planned meeting of EU health ministers could
prove that no risks were involved in importing meat which may be
contaminated with BSE.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Peace slips further from grasp: A look at the damage to the
talks process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British and Irish ministers will meet in London today in the aftermath of
last night's failed IRA mortar spectacular. They will be even more
determined to demonstrate that there will be no let up in the search for
peace in Northern Ireland. Privately, however, they concede they face a long
hard haul.
The window of opportunity, opened with December's Downing Street
declaration, appears to be creaking shut. The early hopes of imminent peace,
today even more difficult to sustain, have become bogged down in political
diversions which threaten to derail the two governments' initiative.
For London and Dublin, the challenge more than ever is to keep the show on
the road, to build on the genuine consensus which now exists between the two
governments and to insist that their broader, bolder objectives will not be
sidetracked by mortars or sub-plots. It is not going to be easy.
The wave of mass killings last autumn, which gave impetus to intensified
Anglo-Irish efforts to forge a durable settlement, has subsided, lowering
the sense of urgency which underpinned a renewed readiness among the
province's political parties to compromise.
On the political front, the European elections beckon. As a result, the
province's main political parties are already adopting a markedly more
aggressive tone in discussing the prospects for a settlement. The Ulster
Unionists are particularly mindful of the need to protect their flank
against the Rev Ian Paisley's hardline Democratic Unionists.
London has all but abandoned hope of reaching the stage where round-table
talks between Ulster's main non-violent parties and the two governments can
be resurrected until the elections are out of the way. In Dublin there is
also, in the words of one Northern Ireland Office official, 'an acute
awareness of the Ulster calendar'. In addition, the lengthening silence from
Sinn Fein - punctuated by potentially murderous assaults - is increasingly
being seen in both capitals as the republican movement's way of saying no to
the declaration.
A surprise acceptance or semi-acceptance, even now, has not been completely
ruled out. But few expect anything from Sinn Fein that would enable any
significant headway to be made this side of Euro-polling day on June 9.
Not surprisingly, both governments are playing down expectations for today's
session. All the more so since attention is expected to focus on strand two
of the three-stranded process: relations between Dublin and the north.
This, by common consent, is the most difficult circle the talks process will
have to square.
As Lord Fitt, the former leader of the Roman Catholic Social Democratic and
Labour party, told his fellow peers last week: 'It is strand two that will
cause all the difficulties. It has done so in the past and will undoubtedly
do the same again in the future.'
Today's meeting will take stock of the position, which was in effect done at
last weekend's meeting in Dublin between Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern
Ireland Secretary, and Mr Dick Spring, Irish Foreign minister. It will also
discuss progress made by the liaison committee, set up after last month's
so-called Twickenham summit between Mr John Major, the prime minister, and
Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, in reaching a common position on
the way ahead.
But it is thought too early for significant progress to have been made,
making it difficult to publicly demonstrate that the initiative is gathering
momentum.
Today's meeting will not attract the fanfare that surrounded the Downing
Street declaration or the publicity generated by last night's airport raid.
But, although peace is apparently as elusive as ever, the intervening two
months has done nothing to undermine the quiet determination in London and
Dublin to try to finish what they started in September.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Heathrow attack a reminder of IRA capabilities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Heathrow attack served as a potentially devastating reminder of the
IRA's continuing capability to strike on the British mainland and to extract
maximum publicity for its cause, Michael Cassell and Jimmy Burns write.
The mortar assault, although it ended in failure, inevitably gave rise to
speculation that an attack on such a high-profile, security-sensitive target
provides the IRA's answer to the Downing Street declaration.
The organisation prides itself on its independent cell structure which gives
considerable autonomy to on-the-ground 'active service units'. But security
sources believe it unlikely that such an attack would be planned and mounted
without the knowledge of the higher echelons of the IRA command.
MI5 and Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist experts have been privately warning
for months of the possibility of another 'big one' on the mainland to raise
the political stakes.
According to security experts, last night's attack would have been planned
over several weeks, using an active unit of about three people and an
intelligence and support team of at least twice that number.
The mortars and explosive material are likely to have been assembled in at
least one mainland safe-house or depot although the decision to activate the
operation would have come within 24 hours of the attack.
In spite of an impression that the IRA wound down activities in the period
after the joint declaration, the reality is that its campaign has continued
throughout. Until last night, however, it had been confined to Ulster.

FT  10 MAR 94 / MPs may question Thatcher over Pergau
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, PAUL TAYLOR and ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs investigating Britain's offer of Pounds 234m of aid for Malaysia's
Pergau dam have not ruled out the prospect of summoning Baroness Thatcher
before them in the next few weeks to answer questions on the affair.
Members of the Commons foreign affairs committee, which is investigating the
aid deal, discussed the possibility of summoning the former prime minister
at a private meeting yesterday. The committee confirmed that Lord Howe,
foreign secretary when an offer of aid to Malaysia was first discussed, had
agreed to give evidence to the committee in the next two weeks. It agreed
that a final decision on whether to ask Lady Thatcher to give testimony
would be taken after his appearance.
One committee member said yesterday: 'We discussed Lady Thatcher, but we
decided it would be premature to make a decision at this stage. We want to
see how we progress.'
The committee has interviewed the main participants in the decision to go
ahead with the aid deal, including Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary,
and Lord Younger, who as defence secretary signed a Pounds 1bn arms deal
which was 'briely entangled' with the aid package in March 1988. The
committee's report should be finished in May or June.
Some committee members believe that more evidence is needed to shed light on
decision-making on the aid offer, which was described by a senior Foreign
Office official as an 'abuse' of the aid system.
The committee also agreed yesterday to call officials from Balfour Beatty
and Cementation, the construction companies that were contracted to help
build the dam. It will also take evidence from pressure groups including
Friends of the Earth and the World Development Movement.
A spokeswoman for Lady Thatcher said yesterday that she was 'not saying
anything on this subject whatsoever' and she did not comment on invitations
until they had been received.
Meanwhile, BICC, the British cables and construction group which owns
Balfour Beatty, said it had received assurances that a Pounds 70m civil
engineering contract for work on the new Pounds 3bn Kuala Lumpur airport
would not be affected by Malaysia's ban on UK companies participating in new
government contracts.
Balfour Beatty said it had a letter of intent covering earthworks at the
airport site before the ban was imposed. Sir Robin Biggam, BICC's chairman,
said Mr Peter Mason, Balfour Beatty's chief executive, had visited Malaysia
last week and was told by the government it wanted Balfour to go ahead with
the project.
On prospects for further contracts Sir Robin said: 'The future is uncertain
but we are hoping for the best.'
Alexander Nicoll writes: British exports to Asia rose 29 per cent last year
to about Pounds 13bn from Pounds 10bn in 1992, and the region is receiving
higher priority in the commercial efforts of the Foreign Office, Mr Douglas
Hurd, the foreign secretary, said yesterday.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Mayhew defends N Ireland committee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Patrick Mayhew last night insisted that the establishment of a Northern
Ireland select committee would have 'no adverse effect whatsoever' on the
Ulster talks process.
The Northern Ireland secretary made the assertion as MPs voted to set up
such a committee by a majority of 103 (324-221). A Labour amendment to give
the body more powers than those proposed by the government was defeated by
58 votes (298-240).
The move will be widely seen as a reinforcement of the government's
commitment to the province's unionist majority.
Another cross-party committee of MPs will now deliberate on the detailed
composition of the new body, which may start work soon after Easter.
According to Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, ministers have
recommended that 13 MPs should sit on it and that the government should be
expected 'to be able to command a majority'.
The Tory proposals are thought to call for six of the 13 members to be
Conservatives, with the government's effective majority kept intact by the
presence of Sir James Kilfedder, the usually loyal Ulster Popular Unionist
MP for North Down.
Sir Patrick was goaded into his one-sentence intervention in last night's
debate by a Social Democratic and Labour party claim that government consent
for the committee was a 'political act'.
Mr Eddie McGrady, SDLP MP for South Down, urged MPs to reject the
government's proposal and support political talks between Northern Ireland's
main political parties and the peace process 'against which this proposal
will impact'.
Mr Kevin McNamara, shadow Northern Ireland secretary, accused the government
of allowing short-term party interest to take priority over the peace
process.
The 'primary reason' that the government had conceded a select committee was
the need to maintain the 'understanding' reached with the Ulster Unionist
party in return for the support of its nine MPs in crucial Maastricht votes.
Mr McNamara also complained bitterly about the government's proposals for
Labour to have only two seats on the committee and the SDLP only one.
Ministers were proposing to 'gerrymander the composition of the committee,'
he said.
Opposition concerns were partly echoed by Mr Peter Temple-Morris, the Tory
MP for Leominster, who warned that the move would be perceived as
'integrationist'.
Mr William McCrea, the hardline Democratic Unionist MP for Mid Ulster, said
he was 'delighted' that MPs would now have the right to scrutinise Northern
Ireland ministers. 'Direct rule is remote. Ministers have to be brought to
book,' he said.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Youth wins Pounds 24,000 in sex bias case
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ms Karen Bishop, 17, was awarded more than Pounds 24,000 damages yesterday
after winning a sex discrimination case against Cooper Thames Ditton, a BMW
car franchise holder based in Surrey.
An industrial tribunal in Croydon, south London, decided she had been
unfairly denied a mechanic's apprenticeship in favour of two 16-year-old
boys because she was female. She was 15 at the time.
Ms Bishop said after the hearing: 'I passed my test two weeks ago and drive
a Mini. I might use some of the money on a new car, but it won't be a BMW.'

FT  10 MAR 94 / BCCI creditors get details of deal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The creditors' committee to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International is expected to meet the liquidators at the end of next week to
give its verdict on a proposed new agreement with the government of Abu
Dhabi, the bank's majority shareholder.
Representatives met the liquidators from accountants Touche Ross to learn
for the first time details of the agreement which was reached in the past
few days.
The settlement would include a payment of about Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 1.2bn)
from Abu Dhabi and a restructuring of its claims against BCCI in exchange
for agreement by the liquidators not to be sued.
The agreement had to be renegotiated following a surprise rejection of the
original by the Luxembourg appeals court in October.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Rethink on crime payouts rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is determined to press ahead with changes to the criminal
injuries compensation scheme, in spite of claims that the reforms will
unjustly reduce payments to victims, Kevin Brown writes.
A senior official said there was no question of a rethink on the proposed
changes, which would replace individual assessments with a fixed tariff.
Labour said yesterday that the tariff would reduce payments to sexually
abused children, families of murder victims and injured police.
The reforms have been criticised in the Lords, where peers said they could
be unconstitutional and open to judicial review.
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, is understood to have taken legal
advice which supports the government view that the changes can be
implemented in April as planned.
Downing Street insisted that the scheme would remain the most generous in
Europe.
Officials said that some payments would rise. Compensation for aggravated
rape will rise from an average of Pounds 9,500 to Pounds 10,000, and
payments for facial scarring will rise from an average of Pounds 6,000 to
Pounds 7,500.
However, there was unrest among Conservative backbenchers about the
government's admission that the reforms will cut the cost of the scheme from
some Pounds 500m to about Pounds 250m a year.
It was also disclosed in the Lords last night that Sir Patrick Mayhew,
Northern Ireland secretary, is considering extending the changes - which
apply to England, Wales and Scotland - to Ulster.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Labour refuses to back anti-terrorism order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Attempts by Labour leaders to secure a new cross-party consensus on
anti-terrorism legislation ended in acrimony and recrimination in the
Commons last night.
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, seized on the mortar bomb attack on
Heathrow airport in a vain appeal to Labour MPs not to vote against an order
renewing the Prevention of Terrorism Act for a further 12 months.
To government cheers, he said that if the attack was meant to send 'some
signal to the House' MPs of all parties should respond by joining together
in voting for the order.
Labour MPs ignored the home secretary's appeal, angered by his rejection of
their pleas for an inquiry by a senior judge into the provisions permitting
terrorist suspects to be detained for questioning for up to seven days, and
for those from Northern Ireland to be excluded from mainland Britain.
The order was approved with a government majority of 86 (328-242).
Mr Howard infuriated Labour MPs by repeatedly insisting that their main
objective was to escape the political consequences of continuing to vote
against the renewal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act.
In a series of clashes Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, accused Mr
Howard of 'ranting' in the hope of securing party advantage by accentuating
the divide between the two main parties.
Mr Blair suggested that the government's partisan approach had been
signalled in advance of the debate by the leaking of information about last
week's confidential talks on the operation of the act between Mr John Smith,
the Labour leader, and Mr John Major, the prime minister.
Like the prime minister, Mr Howard denied that the leak originated from the
Home Office, either through civil servants or political advisers, or other
government sources.
Mr Smith issued a statement underlining his dissatisfaction with the outcome
of the inquiry ordered by the prime minister, which had been carried out 'in
little more than 24 hours'. He added: 'I remain deeply disturbed both at the
leak and at Mr Major's failure to discover its source.'
Mr David Trimble, chief spokesman in the debate for the Ulster Unionists,
reaffirmed support for the renewal of the act but agreed with some points
made by Labour.
He suggested that a judicial officer, with a role similar to that of
procurators fiscal in Scotland, should be involved in authorising the
detention of terrorist suspects for as long as seven days.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Scott queries Customs' methods in Matrix case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The role of Customs and Excise in investigating alleged breaches of export
regulations in the Matrix Churchill case was challenged yesterday by Lord
Justice Scott.
The judge questioned whether Customs had gained a sufficiently 'rounded
picture' of the facts of the case before prosecuting three businessmen for
illegally exporting defence-related machine tools to Iraq.
He was speaking after taking oral evidence from Mr Peter Wiltshire, senior
investigating officer in the Matrix Churchill case.
Mr Wiltshire told the inquiry that he and Customs lawyers prepared their
prosecution without taking statements from Whitehall officials directly
involved in the licensing arrangements for Matrix Churchill exports. He also
admitted that Customs either ignored or delayed circulating some
intelligence reports relevant to the case that had been provided by MI6.
These reports included details about the extent to which Matrix Churchill
businessmen had been supplying information to the intelligence services.
Mr Wiltshire said that he had gathered evidence that the Matrix Churchill
businessmen had deceived Department of Trade and Industry licensing
officials about the nature of the machine tools they were exporting. But the
judge said Customs had the responsibility to fully test the defence case -
that the machine tools had been exported with the tacit agreement of the
government.
The judge asked Mr Wiltshire: 'If the truth was that the DTI didn't mind . .
. shouldn't you have investigated the background to see whether this was
likely to be the case?' Mr Wiltshire said a trawl of official papers
convinced him that no one in government 'really knew' what Matrix Churchill
was up to.
The hearing continues today.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Railtrack warns of cut in subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Private operators running trains will be forced to make big efficiency gains
as subsidies are reduced, a director of Railtrack, the state-owned company
set up to take over responsibility for British Rail's track and signalling,
will warn today.
Although the government has promised to increase subsidies in line with
higher track charges, Sir Christopher Foster, a Railtrack director, says the
operators' ability to make efficiency gains will reduce the need for big
rail subsidies.
In a speech to be delivered today to the University of Leeds, Sir
Christopher will say that a commitment by the government to provide a
subsidy to sustain rail services 'is not the same as saying that the current
level of real subsidy should be maintained'. He believes that after the
first year the government will reduce the Pounds 930m annual subsidy as the
new train operators will be expected to make improvements to BR's
'old-established working practices'.
Sir Christopher, who helped shape railway privatisation as a special adviser
to the Department of Transport, says some of the potential entrants have put
forward ideas on how to improve working practices. He believes railway
timetables - which at present take BR up to 18 months to change - and
scheduling of trains could be radically altered. He says this could save
private operators significant amounts of money.
He says that in the long term rolling stock companies, which are to be sold
off separately, may find the government cutting the subsidy. Sir Christopher
adds that it would not be in the taxpayers' interest if companies bidding
for the rolling stock companies did not think that the government was
planning to cut back demand through reduced subsidy.
While the government's plan is to open up rail franchises to competition,
Sir Christopher confirms that it is likely to be controlled in the
short-term.
Ministers are anxious to avoid the open competition triggered by bus
privatisation, where fierce rivalry erupted on city-centre routes, clogging
traffic and leading to a poorer service.
Sir Christopher says that in the long term rail operators wanting to run
trains on lucrative routes may have to pay the franchisee a fee towards the
operation of unremunerative services.
Balfour Beatty Civil Engineering yesterday won the Pounds 60m main contract
to build the underground stations and tunnels for the Heathrow Express
project, Paul Betts writes.
The Pounds 300m joint project by BAA, the privatised airports group, and BR
is to construct an express rail link between Heathrow and the centre of
London.
The service, scheduled to start operating in December 1997, will mean that
the world's busiest international airport can be reached from Paddington
Station in 16 minutes.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Security fears revived at vital strategic target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like the City of London, which has been struck by two IRA attacks in the
past two years, Heathrow airport is an important target both economically
and symbolically.
It is the world's busiest international airport, handling more than 42m
passengers a year, and is one of the UK's most important assets.
It handles 40 per cent of all passenger traffic through UK airports, while
Heathrow's World Cargo Centre is second only to the port of Dover in terms
of the value of goods handled, with the equivalent of Pounds 34bn in visible
trade.
Heathrow is a significant employer - 50,000 people work at the airport,
including 1,400 security staff, and an estimated 20,000 local jobs exist as
a direct result of airport activity.
Eighty different airlines use the airport, serving more than 200
destinations, with more than 370,000 aircraft movements a year.
Closure of Heathrow for a whole day, for example as the result of terrorist
action, could ground about 1,000 flights leaving up to 100,000 passengers
stranded. Repeated closures that damaged its reputation for reliability
could cost the airport hundreds of millions of pounds in lost business.
Heathrow is also the centre of a thriving local hotel and conference
industry, with 20 hotels offering about 5,000 beds in the immediate
vicinity.
The incident last night was the first mortar attack on mainland Britain
since the IRA used home-made firing tubes to bomb a cabinet meeting in
Downing Street in February 1991.
Previous mortars have consisted of a 9in-diameter, 3ft-long steel tube. The
apparently improvised weapon used last night has an even longer firing tube
for greater accuracy and range. In the past the weapons have been used most
effectively at ranges of between 400m and 500m. While two bombs landed on
the runway without detonating, their firing point in the car park of the
Excelsior Hotel would have brought a number of sensitive targets within
range.
One potential target from this position is the traffic tunnel under the
runway that acts as the main thoroughfare into the terminal areas.
Security within the airport perimeter fence was stepped up during the 1970s
due to the IRA threat and again in 1986 when police began carrying machine
guns in the airport lounges after terrorist attacks at Vienna and Rome
airports. The Excelsior Hotel, sited on a public road north of the airport,
does not enjoy the protection afforded inside the fence.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Wider financial regulatory net urged

<TEXT>
The sale of savings products such as Tessas, which were seen as alternatives
to investment products, should be included in the retail financial services
regulatory regime, a Standard Life executive told MPs yesterday.
Mr Jim Stretton, the life insurance company's deputy managing director, told
the cross-party Commons treasury committee inquiry into financial regulation
that the rules should cover all products which seemed to be in competition

vehicles, which customers saw as quite similar to unit trusts.
Mr Stretton again signalled that Standard Life was likely to join the
Personal Investment Authority, the new watchdog to protect private
investors, in spite of the company's preference for a single-tier statutory
regulator. He resigned from the PIA board because most of its members would
not come from the financial services industry so, he said, it would not be
real self-regulation.
He expressed some sympathy for proposals by Mr George Greener, chairman of
Allied Dunbar and Eagle Star, for a single regulator in which an executive
committee of people working in financial services was supervised by a board
of public interest directors.
He made it clear, however, that he did not believe there was enough common
ground among the PIA's opponents to prevent the watchdog becoming
operational in the summer.

FT  10 MAR 94 / NUM in ballot on new structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Union of Mineworkers yesterday started balloting its Yorkshire
members over merger plans which, if defeated, would spell the end for the
union's structure.
A close vote could even bring into question Mr Arthur Scargill's presidency,
although those campaigning against the executive admitted yesterday that
such an outcome was unlikely.
The merger vote has been brought to a head because the NUM, which had
245,000 members in 1982, has about 8,000 members, nearly 6,000 of whom work
in the Yorkshire area.
This has led to rationalisation plans including the takeover of the
Yorkshire area's Pounds 5.8m assets to help ease the union's financial
crisis.
A ballot is necessary to achieve the merger because of the NUM's federal
structure.
Mr John Walsh, agent and assistant general secretary of the Yorkshire area,
dismissed in January but still in post pending an appeal, has said that he
has been victimised for campaigning against the transfer, saying it will be
detrimental to the union.
Mr Walsh believes the union's national headquarters in Sheffield is
virtually penniless.
He said: 'I think it will be almost down to the reserve fund by now and that
can only be used to back up the pension schemes. It has fixed assets
probably of about Pounds 2m but it can't sell the building because nobody
wants it.'
The NUM executive has said in a letter to Yorkshire members that a merger
will avoid an increase in contributions and save the area and the national
union Pounds 200,000 in administrative costs alone.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Search for peace faces long hard haul: Early hopes for an
Ulster settlement are bogged down in political diversions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British and Irish ministers will meet in London today anxious to demonstrate
publicly that there will be no slacking in the search for peace in Northern
Ireland. Privately, however, they concede they may face a long hard haul.
The window of opportunity, opened with December's historic Downing Street
declaration, appears to be creaking shut. The early hopes of imminent peace
have become bogged down in political diversions which threaten to derail the
two governments' initiative.
For London and Dublin, the challenge is to keep the show on the road, to
build on the genuine consensus which now exists between the two governments
and to insist that their broader, bolder objectives will not be sidetracked
by sub-plots. It is not going to be easy.
The wave of mass killings last autumn, which gave impetus to intensified
Anglo-Irish efforts to forge a durable settlement, has subsided, lowering
the sense of urgency which underpinned a renewed readiness among the
province's political parties to compromise.
On the political front, the European elections beckon. As a result, the
province's main political parties - headed by the Ulster Unionists (mindful
of the need to protect their flank against the Rev Ian Paisley's hardline
Democratic Unionists) - are already adopting a markedly more aggressive tone
in discussing the prospects for a settlement. It is the season for
retreating into entrenched positions.
London has all but abandoned hope of reaching the stage where round-table
talks between Ulster's main non-violent parties and the two governments can
be resurrected until the elections are out of the way. In Dublin there is
also, in the words of one Northern Ireland Office official, 'an acute
awareness of the Ulster calendar'.
In addition, the lengthening silence from Sinn Fein is increasingly being
seen in both capitals as the republican movement's way of saying no to the
declaration.
A surprise acceptance has not been completely ruled out and any positive
initiative by republican leaders could produce another twist in the
political game now being played out. But few expect anything from Sinn Fein
which will enable any significant headway to be made this side of
Euro-polling day on June 9.
Not surprisingly, both governments are accordingly playing down expectations
for today's session. All the more so since attention is expected to focus on
strand two of the three-stranded process: relations between Dublin and the
north.
This, by common consent, is the most difficult - or as one participant puts
it, the most intellectually challenging - circle the talks process will have
to square.
As Lord Fitt, the former leader of the Catholic Social Democratic and Labour
party, told his fellow peers last week: 'It is strand two that will cause
all the difficulties. It has done so in the past and will undoubtedly do the
same again in the future.'
Today's meeting will take stock of the position, in effect already done at
last weekend's meeting in Dublin between Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern
Ireland Secretary, and Mr Dick Spring, Irish Foreign minister. It will also
discuss progress made by the liaison committee, set up after last month's
so-called Twickenham summit between Mr John Major, the prime minister, and
Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, in reaching a common position on
the way ahead.
But it is thought too early for significant progress to have been made,
making it difficult to publicly demonstrate that the initiative is gathering
momentum.
Today's meeting will not attract the fanfare which surrounded the Downing
Street declaration. But, although peace is apparently as elusive as ever,
the intervening two months has done nothing to undermine the quiet
determination in London and Dublin to finish what they started in September.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Merseyside told to rethink EU bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission in Brussels has rejected government proposals for
spending Pounds 690m of EU money to revive Merseyside's flagging regional
economy.
The commission argues that the plans, submitted late last year and calling
for about half the money to go into training, concentrate too much on
solutions which have already failed and show policies for obtaining EU funds
rather than regenerating the area.
Brussels officials have told civil servants and Merseyside political leaders
to rethink their strategy to give a bigger role to the private sector, which
had complained about lack of involvement, and to concentrate on five 'growth
drivers' - human resources, cultural industries, large industries,
knowledge-based business, and small and medium-sized companies.
The five-year 'Objective 1' status money offers funds to areas which has a
gross domestic product per person under 75 per cent of the EU average.
Rejection of the plans was welcomed by Mr Alan Arthur, chairman of coatings
business King and Fowler and organiser of a 500-company local private-sector
pressure group backed by the Confederation of British Industry.
He said: 'Business people need to be able to use this opportunity. So far it
has looked like only benefiting every advisory body and consultant who was
ever born.'

Investors in the venture capital trusts, announced in the November Budget,
will be allowed tax relief on up to Pounds 100,000 a year, under proposals
in a government consultative document published yesterday.
The document suggests the trusts should be taxed and structured in a broadly
similar way to investment trusts.
It proposes that 80 per cent of trust assets should be in unlisted trading
companies. Not more than 15 per cent of the assets should be in any one
company or group of companies.

The dispute over US access to the Japanese cellular phone market - at the
centre of Washington's threats of trade sanctions - appeared to have been
defused yesterday. The Japanese group IDO said it had reached a broad
agreement with Motorola to expand the US company's cellular phone network,
writes Paul Abrahams in Tokyo. Motorola has been trying for almost a decade
to become a significant force in the Japanese mobile phone market.
IDO, partly owned by Toyota, said the two companies were near agreement over
the timing and extent of the expansion of the Motorola network. The Japanese
company is offering to add 159 relay stations for Motorola's car phones. Mr
Arnold Brenner, Motorola's vice-president, who arrived in Tokyo yesterday to
finalise the agreement, wants the expansion completed within 18 months. The
Japanese group says it will take more than two years. Discussions over the
allocation of radio frequencies also need to be concluded.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, yesterday attacked the
European Union for its criticism of the Clinton administration's Japan
policy and invited it to take part in US-Japan talks.
'Europeans are always delighted when they can hold our coats and we go out
to get our noses bloodied,' he told the Economic Strategy Institute. The US
was ready to 'trilateralise or multilateralise' its talks with Japan, 'but
we don't look for criticism from those who sit on the sidelines and don't
get in the game'.
He said he could not define the 'managed trade' the EU was accusing the US
of adopting. He pointed sarcastically to 'voluntary restraint on cars and
trucks at 16 per cent in Europe? That wouldn't be managed trade, would it?'
The EU telecommunications procurement and broadcast directives also curbed
imports, he said. 'Every time it's in their interest to engage in behaviour
which is not opening their markets, that's justified.'
On Japan, Mr Kantor said there had been 'interesting movement' in the
dispute over cellular telephones. He was awaiting documents from Tokyo, he
said, and implied the agreement would have the kind of 'quantitative
indicators' the US insisted on in the broader trade framework talks.
Japan had failed to honour its promise to stimulate its economy, he claimed.
'They adopted a tax rebate proposal for one year and then tried to figure
out how to pay for it. The definition of a stimulus is that you stimulate
your economy and you don't pay for it.'
On other subjects, he said:
The US would ask the new World Trade Organisation, the proposed Gatt
successor, to adopt a multilateral version of the US Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act to prohibit bribery of foreign officials.
The US would seek the adoption of fair labour standards.
He was hopeful that the declining trend in US semiconductor sales in Japan
had been reversed in the fourth quarter of last year, but would move swiftly
if it had not.
The US-EU audio visual dispute had to be dealt with 'industry-to-industry
and then government-to-government'.

<TEXT>
Japan is expected to clear the way today for the US vehicle manufacturer
Chrysler to boost substantially its exports to Japan of Jeep Cherokee sports
utility vehicles, in what appears to be part of a campaign to ease trade
tensions.
Chrysler said yesterday that it had been told at short notice that a
vice-minister in the Transport Ministry would present the company with a
'type certificate' at a meeting in Detroit today.
The certificate allows Chrysler's distributor in Japan to carry out
road-worthiness inspections of Cherokees rather than having to submit each
vehicle for certification by the Transport Ministry.
US car manufacturers have long complained that the ministry inspections are
an important non-tariff trade barrier.
Chrysler, which was told some time ago that it was likely to get a type
certificate, plans to boost its Japanese sales of Cherokees from 4,000 a
year to 10,000. However, a spokeswoman said yesterday that Japan still had a
long way to go to open up its vehicle market.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Korea's leading carmaker, Hyundai, is planning to increase capacity by
60 per cent to 2m units by the year 2000, Mr Se Yung Chung, chairman, said
yesterday. Current global production capacity was 1.25m units, 1.15m in
Korea and 100,000 overseas, he told The Economist motor conference in
Geneva.
The group produced 960,000 vehicles last year with domestic sales of 620,000
and exports of 350,000. It controls close to half the domestic market.
Mr Chung said Hyundai was planning to build more foreign production sites to
reinforce its presence in overseas markets. 'We envision manufacturing
operations in North America, Europe, south-east Asia and in the Middle
East.'
The company also intended to shift the emphasis in its new car development
programme 'away from smaller passenger cars to put more weight on the
development of higher value-added vehicles'.
Production capacity would rise by 110,000 vehicles this year and
construction had just begun on a bus and heavy duty truck plant in Chonju.
The entire South Korean motor industry has embarked on a period of rapid
expansion of capacity and is moving quickly to expand its presence in
foreign markets.
Hyundai is seeking to cut its dependence on Mitsubishi of Japan for engine
technology. Mr Chung said that 'in the not too distant future all Hyundai
vehicles will be equipped with engines and transmissions of Hyundai's
proprietary design'.
The company was seeking 'technological independence' so that its survival
could not be challenged.

FT  10 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Suzuki to export cars from India - Geneva
Motor Show
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Suzuki, the Japanese carmaker, is to begin exporting cars to west Europe
from India. Later this year it will launch in Europe its Alto minicar
produced by Maruti Udyog, its Indian production base.
The car was launched last summer in India, where it is sold as the Maruti
Zen. The Alto is the first model Suzuki has developed at an overseas
production base for introduction in overseas markets.
Maruti Udyog is India's largest car manufacturer and was the first
large-scale Japanese-Indian joint venture. It is 50/50 owned by Suzuki and
the Indian government. Maruti is expanding its production capacity from
130,000 vehicles a year at present to 200,000 by the end of the year in
order to expand sales in both the domestic and export markets.
This spring it will produce its one millionth vehicle since it began
production in 1983 under India's 'people's car plan'. It controls 70 per
cent of the Indian car market.
Suzuki's move to begin supplying the European market from India comes at a
time when it is has run into serious problems with its production plant in
Spain, where it assembles small four-wheel-drive sports/utility vehicles,
the Vitara and the SJ series.
Santana Motor, its 82 per cent owned Spanish subsidiary has recently applied
for protection from creditors under pressure of mounting losses, and Suzuki
has threatened to close the plant unless it receives state aid. Suzuki also
has an assembly plant in Hungary, from which it will export cars to west
Europe next month.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
High-level negotiations are taking place between the Swiss government and
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade on practical and financial
arrangements for Gatt's change of status next year to a fully-fledged World
Trade Organisation. Office accommodation, meeting facilities, parking and
the issue of diplomatic status for senior officials top Gatt's list of
concerns.
Trade officials warned that if satisfactory arrangements were not made the
WTO could look for another home. 'Negotiations are going fairly well. The
Swiss recognise the need to keep the WTO in town,' one official said
yesterday.
Competition for international agencies, including financial inducements, has
intensified in recent years, partly for reasons of prestige but also because
of the boost to the local economy. International organisations and diplomats
account for 9 per cent of employment in Geneva and bring in SFr1.5bn (Pounds
702m) a year to the Swiss city.
Mr Arthur Dunkel, former Gatt director-general and now chairman of a new
private foundation to promote Geneva as an international centre, is said to
be playing a behind-the-scenes role in the negotiations.
Office accommodation is one key factor. The size of the WTO's staff is
certain to be much larger than the 450 now employed by Gatt. Gatt wants to
expand into the whole of its present lakeside building, part of which is now
occupied by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Though the UNHCR is due to move into purpose-built offices this September,
these were planned when the agency was much smaller and there is now not
enough room for all 800 headquarters employees.
Berne has, however, already approved SFr34m to build a new WTO council room.
The present one can no longer accommodate delegates from all Gatt's 116
member nations plus observers.

FT  10 MAR 94 / World Trade News: US seeks 'fairer' export control - A look
at proposals to lift cold war-based curbs on trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From its inception, the administration of President Bill Clinton has made
business its business - in particular high -technology business - and
competitiveness has been given the highest priority.
Despite budget stringency, millions of dollars are flowing into
public-private technology partnerships, Mr Clinton's people fought their
labour and liberal allies to clinch the North American Free Trade Agreement
and the Uruguay Round and officials roam the world hawking contracts for US
companies.
There has, however, been one big disappointment for business. With the end
of the cold war, exporters had high hopes that Mr Clinton would lighten one
of their heaviest burdens: export controls on dual-use and high-technology
products.
Last month Mr Clinton announced proposals for a much-delayed Export
Administration Act, the law governing export controls, and called for
far-reaching licensing liberalisation. The aim has shifted from denying
products to communist nations to controlling the spread of weapons of mass
destruction.
Mr Clinton's proposal calls for strengthening the role of the US Commerce
Department in the approval process. It seeks a rigorous evaluation of
controls, including their economic impact, before they are imposed; the
lifting of old controls that are clearly ineffectual; and simplification of
the licensing process, which would result in an answer to the most
controversial applications within 90 days.
It would introduce the concept of 'unfair impact', allowing industry to
petition for removal of controls based on whether similar products might be
available from other suppliers abroad, on competitive disadvantage or
ineffectiveness of the control.
Business reaction to these proposals have ranged from unimpressed to
hostile. Many computer companies say that no unilateral controls are
necessary because computers have been found to do nothing to aid weapons
proliferation.
Mr Howard Lewis, vice-president of the National Association of
Manufacturers, said that without a total overhaul licensing could cost the
US Dollars 30bn (Pounds 20.5bn) a year in exports by the mid-1990s.
But the president's plan 'would create a system of unilateral controls
loosely co-ordinated with other countries. It would not establish clear
authority and accountability for running the system. And it would not do
enough to tell US companies clearly what, and to whom, not to export', he
said.
Mr Peter McCloskey, president of the Electronic Industries Association, said
the proposed EAA was 'woefully inadequate'.
'Rapidly changing product life cycles necessitate an export control system
that can react quickly and focus only on those technologies that are
critical for the development of weapons of mass destruction,' he said.
Industry has taken its case to Congress where favoured legislation,
sponsored by Delaware Senator William Roth and Minnesota Congressman James
Oberstar, is to be written by a House banking committee today.
This bill would do away with all national security controls imposed
unilaterally on the grounds that critical technologies can best be curbed by
co-operation between supplier countries. It would strengthen international
export controls by extending preferential treatment to countries which agree
to abide by common standards of licensing and enforcement.
It wants business input in multilateral negotiations to establish stricter
controls on a smaller list of strategic commodities.
'Excessively long control lists only spur resistance from allies and
ultimately hinder the effectiveness of control regimes,' said the Coalition
for Fundamental Reform of the Export Control System.
While business is pushing for a multilateral solution, the US and its allies
in the Co-ordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls are meeting
in Paris this week to wind up the organisation's affairs. CoCom is to go out
of business on March 31, and with no great common enemy to unite them, the
allies are far from agreeing a successor organisation.
Russia is to join the new group, which will focus on controls of dual-use
goods and conventional arms to outlaw regimes such as Iran, Iraq, and North
Korea. In the absence of agreement, the US has been expected to propose
continuation of the current control lists.
Meanwhile, Congress must either hope that one day an effective multilateral
regime will be in place, muddle along with sporadic unilateral controls
which disadvantage US industry or lift all export licensing requirements
except for those products most egregiously dangerous.

<TEXT>
A judge has ruled that one of the late Robert Maxwell's companies had no
right to a claim against the New York Daily News, the tabloid newspaper
owned by Maxwell when he died, Reuter reports from New York.
The ruling, made on Tuesday and released yesterday, settled the final
dispute in the newspaper's bankruptcy that came shortly after Maxwell died
in November 1991.
Mirror Group Newspapers claimed the paper stole Dollars 92m (Pounds 63m)
from the group, saying Maxwell and his son, Kevin, took the money to run the
Daily News.
The US bankruptcy judge denied the Mirror claim, saying the Maxwells lied to
the tabloid's directors and their actions hurt the Daily News as well as the
Mirror Group.
The judge said the father and son engaged in an 'elaborate ruse', concealing
the source of money to the newspaper and planned to strip the tabloid of
even more money at a time when its ability to publish was in jeopardy.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Special counsel fails to win Whitewater accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Robert Fiske, the independent counsel, and senior Republicans yesterday
failed in their first attempt to negotiate a compromise under which Congress
could hold hearings into the Whitewater affair.
Both Senator Al D'Amato from New York and Sen William Cohen from Maine
remained hopeful some resolution could be reached. Sen Cohen spoke of
delaying a congressional investigation and of not granting immunity from
prosecution to witnesses, if either made Mr Fiske's task easier.
The special counsel did not budge from his objection that hearings on
Capitol Hill could jeopardise the integrity of his own investigations.
But he conceded he could not stop Congress calling hearings. He also implied
he could work around them if they were confined to the question of meetings
between White House and regulatory officials on the status of Madison
Guaranty, the Arkansas savings bank at the heart of the Whitewater affair.
He added he was completely satisfied with White House co-operation to date.
The failed Arkansas savings and loan institution is at the centre of the
Whitewater allegations that Mr and Mrs Clinton engaged in improper financial
dealings in the 1980s.
The Democratic leadership on Capitol Hill seemed more determined than ever
yesterday to frustrate Republican wishes. Sen George Mitchell of Maine, the
majority leader, said the Republicans wanted to stage 'a political circus'
that would 'throw up a lot of dust and embarrass the president'.
Mr Fiske, Senator Mitchell said, 'is independent, is a Republican, was
selected at the request of Republicans and it's very clear, as he says, you
can't have both a congressional investigation and an independent
investigation'.
Press advice on the issue was mixed yesterday. The New York Times urged a
compromise that would give Mr Fiske 'a head start, probably measured in
weeks' before Congress got in on the act.
The Wall Street Journal, as ever virulently anti-Clinton, headlined its
comment yesterday: 'The Fiske Cover-up.' It pretty much demanded
fully-fledged hearings.
The president's press spokeswoman was forced to deny rumours in the New York
markets that Mr Roger Altman, the deputy Treasury secretary, was about to
resign because he had participated in the S&amp;L meetings. He is among 10
officials under subpoena to testify in front of the federal grand jury
convened by Mr Fiske. Mr Clinton said yesterday he had advised the 10 to be
'very open' and tell everything they knew.
Several news organisations continued to report on the alleged shredding by
the Rose Law Firm of Little Rock, where Mrs Hillary Clinton was a part ner,
of documents purportedly bearing the name of Vincent Foster, the deputy
White House legal counsel who com-mitted suicide last summer.

Mexico's interest rates rose for the second week running yesterday after
further volatility in the peso/dollar exchange rate, writes Damian Fraser in
Mexico City.
Rates on short-term government paper rose to 9.3 per cent, up 0.29
percentage points from last week.
The rise in rates came as the 48-hour peso/dollar buy rate closed at 3.26
after weakening to 3.30.
The peso has lost some 5 per cent of its value in a month, and has been
close to its central bank limit of 3.357. Currency traders blame the peso's
weakness on low economic growth, mounting political uncertainty in Mexico,
and higher interest rates in the US.
The low growth has encouraged the government - until the last two weeks - to
push interest rates down quickly.
The government's revised figures show growth fell 0.8 per cent in the third
quarter last year, and 0.1 per cent in the fourth quarter.

The 25-year domination of Antiguan politics by the Bird family will continue
with the victory of the incumbent Labour Party in last Tuesday's general
election.
Mr Lester Bird, the Labour leader, is to be sworn in as prime minister,
succeeding his 84-year-old father, Mr Vere Bird Sr, who has resigned.
Preliminary results have given the Labour Party 11 of the 17 seats in the
assembly.
The opposition United Progressive Party, which had one seat in the previous
parliament, took five, with the lone seat on the island of Barbuda going to
the People's Movement.
The campaign was dominated by charges from the opposition that the Labour
government's long control of the government had led to endemic corruption,
with the islands, whose economy is based on tourism, being used for drug
smuggling and money laundering.
Mr Lester Bird consistently rejected the charges during the campaign, but
promised to take a hard line against any impropriety in the government.
The new prime minister's early tasks will include a decision on the role, if
any, which his elder brother, Mr Vere Bird Jr, will play in politics.
Mr Bird Jr, who won a seat, was the central figure in a judicial inquiry
four years ago, in which it was alleged that he had used his office as a
government minister to facilitate the transhipment of Israeli arms to
Colombian drug cartels.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Clinton launches jobs plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday unveiled his plans to overhaul the US
unemployment system to retrain unemployed workers and move them back into
new jobs.
The plan would provide longer unemployment benefits for people who are
undertaking retraining, as well as laid-off workers who decided to open
their own businesses. Mr Clinton also promised to bring six separate state
and federal benefit, counselling and training programmes under a single
roof.
'The first element of the plan is to create one-stop shopping so workers can
go to one office and get the counselling and assistance they need,' Mr
Clinton said at a White House ceremony to launch the plan yesterday
afternoon.
The initiative, which is expected to face considerable modification in
Congress, is likely to be presented by the administration at next week's
Group of Seven jobs conference in Detroit as a centrepiece of efforts the US
is making to improve employment prospects.
While the US has generated far more jobs than the less flexible European
economies over the past decade, European governments have often suggested
that the US system conceals the real level of joblessness by simply cutting
off unemployment benefits after a relatively short period. They have also
criticised the inadequacy of US training schemes.
US officials this week have insisted that they want to move beyond that
1980s argument, insisting that each of the G7 countries can learn from the
others.
'We are still going to say to them in Europe that part of their problem
stems from the fact that their labour markets are very inflexible. . . . But
one of the places where we are going to learn the most is on training and
moving people from school to work, and we are going to learn a lot from the
Europeans on that,' said Mr Lewis Alexander, chief economist at the US
Commerce Department.
The plan put forward by Mr Clinton yesterday would provide benefits to
unemployed workers for up to two years of training, at a cost, when it is
fully phased in, of about Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) a year.
US unemployment benefits usually run out after 26 weeks, although for much
of the last three years Congress has voted to extend benefits for between
seven and 33 additional weeks.
Mr Clinton said yesterday that the old unemployment benefits system was
designed to give people 'enough to live on until their old jobs came back
because most jobs were lost in ordinary cyclical recessions'.
That system was no longer adequate in an economy where three out of four
workers laid off last year expected never to get their old jobs back, he
said, and where the average US worker would change jobs seven or eight times
in a lifetime.

FT  10 MAR 94 / IADB members raise - and lower - the stakes: A look at a
capital-boosting deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US and its Latin American partners have agreed to reduce their stake in
the Inter-American Development Bank as part of an accord to boost the bank's
capital by Dollars 40bn (Pounds 27bn).
The agreement, which will reduce the US shareholding in the bank to around
30 per cent from 34.6 per cent, also envisages the bank lifting its current
bar on lending to the private sector.
The capital increase, if details are finalised as expected at the bank's
annual meeting in Guadalajara, Mexico, next month, would allow the bank's
non-regional members - particularly Japan and Germany - to expand their
small stakes in the institution.
Japan, which currently holds only 1.08 per cent of the bank's capital, has
been pressing for an expansion in its stake to reflect its financial support
for US initiatives in Latin America. The agreement is also expected to
provide Japan with an executive director on the board, which will be thus
expanded to 13 members.
As part of the accord, the borrowing members of the bank from Latin America
and the Caribbean will reduce their combined stake from 53.8 per cent to a
fraction over 50 per cent.
The Dollars 40bn increase should allow the bank to continue with a lending
programme of Dollars 7bn-Dollars 8bn a year for an indefinite period.
Only 2.5 per cent of the increase will be paid in by shareholders, the rest
being callable capital against which the bank will be able borrow in capital
markets. The increase in the stake of the non-regional shareholders will
reduce considerably the budget implications for the US, which is currently
Dollars 847m in arrears in its commitments to international institutions.
The bank's lending to the private sector will be limited to infrastructure
projects, with a ceiling probably of 5 per cent - Dollars 350m to Dollars
400m a year. The bank will only lend where the private sector is also
providing finance, and to a maximum 25 per cent of total lending.
Under the accord, the bank will double the proportion of its lending going
to so-called social sectors, such as primary health and education which are
now considered the central issue for the region's development. Some 50 per
cent of transactions (40 per cent by value of lending) will be directed to
these areas. The bank will also direct lending for the first time to improve
the quality of government - for instance, enhancing the region's judicial
systems.
Mr Enrique Iglesias, the bank's president, said the capital replenishment
accord was 'more than a capital increase. It's a redefinition of bank policy
to better respond to Latin America's problems.' However, there was still
much to do before the increase was finally agreed.
This includes completing discussions about the bank's soft-loan window, the
Fund for Special Operations, and resolving differences over whether another
seat on the board is required for the bank's Latin American members as
Chile, especially, is seeking.
However, a US Treasury official was optimistic that the issues could be
resolved by the Guadalajara meeting and remarked on the 'positive manner' in
which the discussions had been held.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Mexico rates up as peso weakens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's interest rates rose for the second consecutive week yesterday after
further volatility in the peso/dollar exchange rate.
Rates on short-term government paper rose to 9.3 per cent, an increase of 29
basis points from last week. The rise in rates came as the 48-hour
peso/dollar buy rate at one point weakened to 3.30 yesterday morning,
although it strengthened to 3.2750 at noon.
The peso has lost some 5 per cent in a month, and has been close to its
central bank limit of 3.357. Currency traders blame the peso's weakness on
low economic growth, mounting political uncertainty in Mexico, and higher
interest rates in the US.
The low growth has encouraged the government - until the last two weeks - to
push interest rates down quickly.
The government's revised figures show growth fell 0.8 per cent in the third
quarter last year, and 0.1 per cent in the fourth quarter. But as US
interest rates have risen, the spread between Mexican and US returns reached
historic lows. This has sharply cut the attraction of Mexican government
paper to foreign investors, according to Mr Joge Mariscal of Goldman Sachs,
the private US investment bank.
Other investors blame the weak currency on the uncertain political
landscape, especially the rumoured presidential ambitions of Mr Manuel
Camacho, the peace envoy to the troubled southern state of Chiapas. 'If
Camacho registers then there will be so much uncertainty that the exchange
rate may not hold within its band,' said a leading money market trader in
Mexico City.
A number of opposition political parties could replace their existing
presidential candidate with Mr Camacho up to a month before August's
election. Aides to Mr Camacho make it clear he has not ruled out running for
the presidency. His eventual decision may depend on support for Mr Luis
Donaldo Colosio, the candidate of the governing party, in opinion polls.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Shekel curbs to go if inflation rate is reduced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TEL AVIV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel will make its currency, the shekel, fully convertible but only after
its inflation rate has moved much closer to those of its leading trading
partners, Mr Jacob Frenkel, governor of Israel's central bank, said.
He also said he wanted further measures to liberalise the economy before
allowing Israelis and foreigners complete freedom to buy and sell the
currency.
However, Mr Frenkel made clear in an interview that the bank would move to
full convertibility as soon as possible but the move would have to be
sustainable and not subject to setbacks.
Israel has progressively liberalised its once strictly controlled foreign
exchange and money markets since the middle of the 1980s as part of a policy
of opening its economy to the outside world. But while trading in the shekel
for trade and business purposes is practically free of regulation, Israeli
residents still face restrictions on opening bank accounts and buying
property abroad.
Mr Frenkel said because of Israel's geo-political position, 'there is a lot
of vulnerability' in the economy. Full convertibility could expose Israel's
economy to 'very huge swings' of capital in and out of the country.
The experience of former communist countries that have rapidly made their
currencies convertible showed that premature action in this area was
counter-productive and inevitably forced a retreat, Mr Frenkel said.
Israel's inflation rate - currently about 10 per cent - would have to be
much closer to the 2 or 3 per cent inflation rates of the big industrialised
countries. This would be a precondition for making the exchange rate of the
shekel more stable.
Israel has set an 8 per cent inflation target this year and hopes to achieve
further staged reductions in inflation in the years ahead. Consistent with
its inflation target, the Bank of Israel pursues a 'crawling band' exchange
rate policy that envisages a 6 per cent depreciation of the shekel's value
against the currencies of its main trading partners this year.
Mr Frenkel said the bank was waiting to see the impact of new housing and
land policies on inflation but would not hesitate to raise interest rates
further if necessary to achieve the 8 per cent target for this year.
'We will not give any weight to questions of controversy in the conduct of
interest rate or monetary policy. It would be a mistake,' he said.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Japanese corruption probe widened
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese public prosecutors yesterday widened their investigation into
alleged corruption when they raided more than 30 homes and offices of
politicians and construction company executives, Paul Abrahams writes from
Tokyo.
The raids followed a request by prosecutors earlier this week for the
parliamentary immunity of Mr Kishiro Nakamura, a former Liberal Democratic
party construction minister, to be lifted so he could be arrested on charges
of bribery.
Mr Nakamura, whose home was among those raided, yesterday resigned from the
LDP. A decision about whether his immunity should be lifted must be made by
a full session of the lower house of parliament. It could give its consent
today. If the request is successful, it would be the first time since 1967
that a Japanese lawmaker has been arrested while parliament was sitting.
The prosecutors allege Mr Nakamura accepted a Y10m (Pounds 64,000) bribe on
January 13 1992 from Mr Shinji Kiyoyama, a former vice-president of the
construction company Kajima.
Yesterday's raids covered the homes of Mr Rokuro Ishikawa, chairman of
Kajima, Mr Akira Miyazaki, the group's president, as well as Kajima's head
office. The home of Mr Tsuneo Aki, vice-president of Obayashi corporation,
one of Japan's five biggest construction groups, was also raided.
Rising long-term interest rates in Japan threaten to have an adverse impact
on the economy, Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the country's central bank,
said yesterday, following the decision on Tuesday by the Industrial Bank of
Japan to raise its long-term prime-lending rate by 0.6 percentage points to
4.4 per cent. He said the Bank of Japan had no intention of intervening.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Japan's consumers spurn rice fit for an emperor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Emperor Akihito has consented to eat it. Mr Eijiro Hata, Japan's farm
minister, tried it yesterday and found it 'tasty in its own way'. But a
public suspicious of the foreign rice now on sale in the country prefers to
queue for up to two hours for the more expensive domestic equivalent.
As Mr Hata toured Tokyo stores to try to end panic buying of domestic rice,
the Imperial Household Agency said it had bought samples of US, Chinese and
Thai rice and the emperor had consented to eat the varieties mixed with
domestic rice.
Indeed, for general sale the government will require the blending of foreign
and domestic rice, so consumers will not be in a position to discriminate
against the imported crop. A first wave of buying began a few weeks ago
after reports that only 30 per cent of the rice marketed would be domestic.
The Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks, a poor rice crop due to
typhoons and a cold summer have forced the government into covering the
shortage with imports.
Rumours of cigarette butts and rodents found in foreign rice exacerbated
fears about the imported product, already suspected in Japan of being unsafe
because of the pesticides and fungicides used. However, even the imported
rice for blending has been delayed in reaching national retailers, and a
second wave of buying has even spread to foreign rice.
Long queues now form in front of supermarkets on the day they receive their
rice supply from wholesalers. 'People are buying two to three times as much
as they usually do,' says Mr Yoshiro Takahashi of Rice Data Bank, which
provides information on rice distribution.
He says some wholesalers and distributors are hoarding rice in the hope that
the price will rise further.
However, many of the older generation insist they would rather eat bread and
noodles than imported rice. Some retailers say a number of consumers seem to
be put off from eating rice due to the confusion.
The Tokyo stock market has reacted to the current chaos in its own frenetic
way. Bakery and flour mill stocks have surged during the past week in
anticipation of a rise in bread consumption due to the rice shortage.

Riot police fired at demonstrators in the South African black 'homeland' of
Bophuthatswana for the second day running yesterday as a civil service
strike paralysed the government of increasingly embattled homeland leader
President Lucas Mangope. At least 32 people were wounded, witnesses said.
The homeland government said a police officer was killed.
President Mangope, who yesterday closed down the broadcasting service and
sacked all of its staff, rejected a request from the Independent Electoral
Commission to allow campaigning and polling for the April elections to take
place in the homeland. Bophuthatswana said earlier this week it would not
participate in these elections.
As teargas drifted toward the government offices from the nearby University
of Bophuthatswana, Finance Minister Ephraim Keikalame admitted candidly to
journalists: 'It is not possible to have an effective functioning government
under these circumstances.'
Almost the whole of the public service appeared to be on strike, including
essential services like hospitals, but telephones and electricity continued
to function. The capital's main hospital complex was deserted by staff, with
some patients lying unattended.
Outside the university, pol-ice armoured vehicles roared up and down
throughout the day, firing teargas cannisters and rubber bullets at students
barricading the entrance gate.
The rioting provoked a threat of direct South African intervention, with the
Transitional Executive Council, the multi-party body overseeing government
in the run-up to elections, saying it would give President Mangope a week
'to change his attitude' after which steps would be taken to force
reincorporation.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Nigeria and Cameroon clash over oil-rich area
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sabre-rattling and nationalist sentiment in Nigeria and Cameroon over a
disputed oil-rich peninsula that forms their shared border disguise vital
economic interests in the area as the governments of both countries face
strident opposition from democracy campaigners and dissenting minority
tribes.
Nigeria has almost 10 times the population of its neighbour and for years
the Bakassi peninsula has been mainly inhabited by Nigerians, many of them
migrant fishermen.
Although this area of south-eastern Nigeria produces 90 per cent of the
nation's foreign earnings, the dozens of minority tribes in the region have
been, on the government's own admission, neglected. Dispossession or
pollution of their farming and fishing areas have not been offset by a share
of the oil wealth, which has been invested in the north and west of Nigeria.
Large investment in exploration deep offshore could make the region even
wealthier in the next century. Bakassi also controls the seaway leading to
Calabar, the nearest big Nigerian port and the site of a new Export
Processing zone.
As the Nigerian government prepares for its delayed constitutional
conference, the eastern minorities are arguing for a better deal and more
autonomy. The military regime suspects that talk of autonomy could lead to
secession and the loss of massive oil wealth.
Cameroon's largest and most vocal dissident political grouping, the
opposition SDF party, has its stronghold near the border region. The mainly
Anglophone region produces most of Cameroon's wealth and is home to more
than 2m Nigerians.
Bakassi was part of the British-governed southern Cameroons from the First
World War until 1961 when the territory voted in a plebiscite to join the
newly independent Cameroon. In 1975 at the Marua treaty Nigeria's Gen Yakubu
Gowon re-affirmed Cameroon's claim to the area, allegedly to thank Cameroon
for providing access to re-capture Calabar during the Biafran war.
Nigeria's federal survey department published an atlas in 1978 signed by
then head of state Gen Olusegun Obasanjo which clearly shows Bakassi to be
in Cameroon.
Squabbles over the boundary in the swamps led to a clash of troops in 1981
then the row subsided. But Bakassi became an international dispute early
this year when Nigeria moved troops into the peninsula to counter alleged
raids by Cameroonian gendarmes against Nigerian fishermen. Last month,
Cameroon demanded the withdrawal of the troops from its territory and
complained to the United Nations Security Council.
After a skirmish on February 18 between rival military patrols in the
peninsula, with reports of light casualties on both sides, Cameroon asked
France for assistance under a bilateral defence pact. France sent two
helicopters and 15 troops to the capital Yaounde, a day's drive from the
border, at the same time as a senior diplomatic mission including President
Francois Mitterrand's special adviser on Africa, Mr Bruno Delaye, to mediate
between the two sides.
Both Britain and France are advising that the dispute be resolved in
bilateral talks, possibly with some assistance from the international court
at The Hague, and both believe that a debate before the UN Security Council,
of which France this month is chairman and Nigeria a temporary member, would
be acrimonious.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Overheating to dominate congress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China's parliament begins a two-week session today that is certain to be
dominated by concerns over the country's overheating economy and inflation
which exceeded 20 per cent in the big cities last year, writes Tony Walker.
China's Premier Li Peng, in his 'work report', will call for a slowing of
economic activity from 13 per cent last year to 9 per cent this year, but
economists say that such a sharp reduction is unrealistic.
Mr Li, who is beginning the second year of his second five-year term, will
emphasise the need for political and social stability. He can be expected to
give little quarter to international demands for greater political
liberalisation.
This National People's Congress, which will seek further to consolidate
China's economic reforms, is being held in the shadow of the continuing row
with Britain over Hong Kong and against a background of international
concern about China's human rights behaviour. Mr Li will assail Britain over
the breakdown of talks on Hong Kong's future, saying that London should
assume 'full responsibility'.
The NPC will deal with a modest legislative programme in contrast to last
year.

FT  10 MAR 94 / HK reform bill faces tough debate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The second and final stage of governor Chris Patten's democratic reforms for
Hong Kong, containing many of the more controversial elements that failed to
win Beijing's approval after 17 rounds of negotiations, was introduced into
the colony's Legislative Council (LegCo) yesterday.
The bill which, among other proposals, gives the colony's 2.7m-strong
workforce a second vote through the creation of nine new functional
constituencies (industry-based groupings) replacing corporate votes with
votes cast by individual employees, is expected to have a stormy ride
through LegCo even in the absence of a further outburst from China.
While Beijing itself has already made clear that it views the move as a
unilateral step by Britain and therefore one which brings to an end
co-operation between the two over the future of Hong Kong, and has further
said it will unwind representative bodies on resuming sovereignty, LegCo
members are also lining up for battle. Some believe the proposals do not go
far enough; others will push for a watered down version.
However, with the bill designed to prepare the way for elections this year,
there will also be pressure to move swiftly. Legislation would need to be
enacted before LegCo's summer recess in July to allow the administration to
put in place the practical preparations for the elections, the government
said.
The government believes the proposals will lead to fair and open elections,
and that broadening the franchise will strengthen the credibility of the
functional constituency system.
However, Mr CM Leung, deputy secretary for constitutional affairs, conceded
it was still in a state of evolution. 'The system is not perfect,' he said.
If the bill is passed, all adults aged 18 or above and registered in the
electoral roll will be able to cast votes in up to two categories: their
geographical constituency and their functional constituency. Non-working
groups such as housewives will be restricted to a single vote.
In addition to introducing nine new functional constituencies, four existing
professional groups will be expanded. By scrapping corporate voting -
whereby one authorised person casts votes on behalf of his company - the
government claims it will rid the colony of the problem of multiple voting,
which occurs when one director controls a number of companies and hence a
number of votes.
The first-past-the-post voting system will be adopted for all bar three
functional constituencies, where the preferential elimination system will be
retained in view of their smaller franchises.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Dalai Lama attacks Beijing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Dalai Lama yesterday attacked China for paying 'lip service' to his
attempts to negotiate on the future of Tibet and said Tibetans might have to
adopt a new approach to their freedom struggle.
The exiled leader's statement, issued from his home in Dharamsala, India, is
likely to increase tension during this week's visit to Beijing by Mr Warren
Christopher, US secretary of state.
Tibet is among the human rights issues on which the US is demanding progress
before China's most-favoured nation (MFN) trading status is renewed this
year.
The Dalai Lama said he had 'left no stone unturned' in seeking an agreement
on the basis of a statement in 1979 by Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's leader,
that 'except for independence of Tibet, all other questions can be
negotiated'. But Beijing had repeatedly rejected his overtures.
He said: 'I must now recognise that my approach has failed to produce any
progress either for substantive negotiations or in contributing to the
overall improvement of the situation in Tibet.'
The Dalai Lama acknowledged that his failure to press for complete
independence had disappointed many Tibetans.
He said conditions in Tibet had worsened dramatically with increased
suppression and marginalisation of Tibetans and the destruction of culture
and the environment.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Christopher's mission imperfect: A look at a difficult visit
to Beijing by the US secretary of state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Such is the fragile state of Sino-US relations and the high stakes involved
that Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, arrives in Beijing
tomorrow just a day after China's annual parliamentary session convenes.
Normally, foreign envoys would be discouraged from visiting during this
two-week period in early spring when 3,000 delegates to China's parliament
gather in the Great Hall of the People, but Mr Christopher's is no ordinary
mission.
The US official, who has met his counterpart, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen,
three times since last year will try to engage the Chinese further on a
range of issues, while at the same time warning them of the seriousness of
the human rights issue.
Judging by the recent spate of arrests of prominent Chinese dissidents, Mr
Christopher faces significant difficulties in his efforts to persuade his
hosts that such persistent harassment threatens renewal of China's
preferential trading status in the US.
More to the point, argument over human rights risks undermining the Clinton
administration's attempts to broaden its links with Beijing that followed a
decision last September to halt the 'downward spiral' in relations.
Washington's Pacific strategy, based on enhancing the role of the Asia
Pacific Economic Co-operation forum with China as a key partner, may also be
jeopardised.
Not least of the regional issues in which China and the US have a vital
interest is that of trying to ensure that the simmering argument over North
Korea's nuclear ambitions does not boil over in a way that might destabilise
the Korean peninsula.
A rupture over human rights could also threaten a booming commercial
relationship that saw two-way trade exceed Dollars 40bn (Pounds 27.3bn) last
year, with the balance heavily in China's favour. The World Bank estimates
that 96 per cent of China's exports to the US are covered by preferential
tariffs.
Mr Christopher was understandably exasperated in remarks to reporters in
Canberra this week when he observed that China was 'going in the wrong
direction' on human rights. Indeed, he was reported to have even canvassed
the possibility of abandoning his Beijing visit in protest at the recent
arrests.
Chinese officials remain confident, however, that in the end Mr Clinton will
feel obliged to renew China's most favoured nation trading status. This
calculation - American officials worry about China under-estimating the
strength of US sentiment on human rights - may in part explain Beijing's
playing 'hardball' on the eve of the visit.
'The Clinton administration will renew China's MFN status because of the
pressure of different groups in the US who have a vested interest in China's
enormous market,' said a senior Chinese adviser on US policy. 'However, from
now until June, there will be a process of hard barg-aining.'
A possible complication for Mr Christopher and Chinese leaders during their
talks in the next few days is that, with parliament in session, no official
will want to be seen adopting a quiescent attitude in what are certain to be
difficult discussions. US officials should steel themselves for some sharp
exchanges.
The US has prepared carefully for the Christopher mission with several
visits recently to Beijing by Mr John Shattuck, the assistant secretary of
state for human rights. He spelled out American requirements for MFN renewal
to meet the criteria of 'overall significant improvement' laid down by Mr
Clinton.
These include access to prisons for the International Committee of the Red
Cross, an end to prison-made exports to the US, the further release of
dissidents, human rights improvements in Tibet and steps toward making it
easier for Chinese to emigrate.
The US could hardly have done more to improve relations since its decision
last September to 'engage' China. Apart from Mr Clinton's meetings in
Seattle with President Jiang Zemin in November, a succession of senior
administration officials have passed through Beijing, including Mr Lloyd
Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, and Mr Charles Freeman, an assistant
secretary of defence.
Indeed, defence co-operation is high on the agenda for Mr Christopher's
visit. The secretary's party includes Mr Frank Wisner, undersecretary of
defence for policy, who is scheduled to stay on in Beijing next week to
discuss ways in which defence relations may be upgraded.
Among various options being considered are expanding co-operation in
peacekeeping and disaster relief operations in the Asian region, and the
establishment of a Joint Commission of Defence Conversion to facilitate
exchanges on converting military factories to civilian use.
This will be the highest level visit by a US defence official since the
Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989.
All this is a long way from the angry exchanges that followed Washington's
decision last August to impose sanctions on the transfer of high-technology
items to China in retaliation for the export of Chinese components to
Pakistan for the M-11 missile.
China denied that it had contravened guidelines of the Missile Technology
Control Regime (MTRC). The episode marked something of a nadir in Sino-US
relations. Mr Christopher will be anxious to avoid another downward spiral,
but equally the US will want to see some early dividends, especially on
human rights, from its policy of constructive engagement.

The Slovak president yesterday accused Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar of
corruption in a speech marking a final break between Slovakia's two top
officials and a new push to end its political paralysis. President Michal
Kovac stopped short of asking for the resignation of the populist prime
minister, who has led Slovakia since it gained independence in the break-up
of Czechslovakia 15 months ago. But deputies later voted for Mr Meciar to
face a no-confidence motion. Mr Kovac, clearly angry stunned lawmakers by
claiming Mr Meciar had told him he wanted a political ally in control of
privatising the economy so he could wring money out of it for his political
party.

<TEXT>
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development last year registered
about a four-fold increase in disbursements of loans and equity investments
to eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Its disbursements increased
to Ecu435m (Pounds 329m) last year from Ecu122m in 1992, with signed loan
and equity commitments rising to Ecu1.79bn during 1993 from Ecu946m during
1992. The bank also registered a small net profit of Ecu4m in 1993, after a
loss of Ecu6m in 1992. The bank was heavily criticised last year for
over-spending in administrative and refurbishment outlays. This provoked a
crisis which led to the resignation of Mr Jacques Attali and his replacement
by Mr Jacques de Larosiere. The bank said it had taken action to lower
operating costs to Ecu137m, 8 per cent below budgeted levels.

<TEXT>
The Bundesbank yesterday sanctioned another modest decline in the repo rate,
signalling that the trend towards cheaper credit in Germany was still
intact. The Bundesbank allowed its key securities repurchase rate to fall to
5.94 per cent, from 5.97 per cent last week. Rates in Belgium edged lower
soon after the German move, with the Belgian National Bank cutting its
central rate to 6.15 per cent from 6.25 per cent. The Bundesbank's repo rate
was cut to 5.97 per cent last week after the central bank had held it steady
at 6 per cent since early December last year. Financial markets had been
hoping for a slightly steeper cut in the repo rate, to as low as 5.90 per
cent, and German stock and bond prices initially eased on the news. But
money market dealers said the small rate cut had reassured the market the
Bundesbank would carry on slowly reducing the cost of borrowing.

MEPs yesterday voted to prevent Britain from avoiding restrictions on the
use of child labour that other European Union members have agreed to.
Britain had sought four years' grace before introducing limits on working
hours and mandatory rest periods for young children and adolescents aged 16
to 18. The British Labour party employment spokesman in the European
Parliament, Steven Hughes, had compiled statistics showing that 39
work-related deaths in Britain since 1990 involved 16-19 year olds. He said
there were indications the European Commission would support parliament's
move to end the British opt-out for working children but not for
adolescents. If the Commission supports the assembly's move, then the
Council of Ministers can only override this by a unanimous vote.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Parliament yesterday rejected proposals to tighten
anti-pollution regulations against car manufacturers from 1996. MEPs threw
out the proposals after strong opposition from the European Commission and
the auto industry which argued it threatened jobs and investment. The vote
opens the way for passage of existing proposals gradually to limit car
emissions through legislation due to come into force in 1996. The car
industry has been working toward a set goal of lower emissions, but became
alarmed after the parliament's environment committee introduced a raft of
amendments for tougher standards and a faster timetable. The amendments also
demanded a 50 per cent increase in air quality standards, as well as new tax
incentives for clean cars and a carbon tax to limit fuel consumption. The
second reading vote at the Strasbourg parliament was eagerly awaited because
it provided a test of the Maastricht treaty's new clauses on co-decision. If
the amendment had secured the 260 votes necessary for passage, it would have
gone back to the Council of Ministers which would have been forced to broker
a compromise or face a showdown with a newly assertive parliament.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italian media magnate Mr Silvio Berlusconi yesterday claimed he was being
subjected to an 'unprecedented campaign of political aggression', reacting
to reports his Fininvest empire was being scrutinised by Milan magistrates.
Mr Berlusconi accused the magistrates of permitting a rumour campaign
suggesting illicit payments had been made by members of Fininvest. For the
past 48 hours the Italian press has been carrying a series of leaks, clearly
coming from the magistrates, suggesting arrests of at least five Fininvest
officials are imminent. The reports have been linked to investigations into
illicit payments allegedly made in connection with the purchase of players
by Mr Berlusconi's AC Milan football club. Mr Berlusconi's attack underlined
the increasingly politicised investigations of the magistrates. It also
coincides with a rise in the temperature of the poll campaign, which Mr
Berlusconi is hoping to win with the Forza Italia movement.

<TEXT>
A possible breakthrough in the dispute between Greece and Macedonia emerged
last night before both sides meet under UN auspices in Geneva today. If
resolved, it could help shore up a fragile stability in the southern
Balkans.
Mr Cyrus Vance, a former US secretary of state and UN mediator in former
Yugoslavia, will discuss the draft accord with Greek foreign minister
Carolos Papoulias and Mr Stevo Crvenkovski, his Macedonian counterpart.
Under the proposed agreement, Macedonia would immediately alter its flag
which carries a starburst symbol linked with the ancient Greek kings of
Macedon. In return, Greece would drop its veto on Macedonian membership of
the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe and participation in
the European Union's aid programme for eastern Europe.
Greek officials have indicated the embargo would be lifted as soon as
Macedonia put another symbol on its flag and gave assurances the
constitutional issue would be addressed.
The possibility of movement follows this week's decision by the EU and the
Commission to soft-pedal on earlier threats of legal action over Greece's
trade embargo, and to acknowledge there is a 'political' element to the
Macedonia dispute. In Strasbourg, Mr Papoulias said the EU's stance had
given Athens room for manoeuvre.
Today's talks coincide with cabinet meetings in Britain and Canada to decide
how many troops, pending support from other countries, they will send to
Bosnia to shore up the ceasefire. Lieutenant General Jean Marcotte, the UN's
military spokesman in Zagreb, Croatia, said yesterday that any delay in
sending troops 'would place the peace process in a critical situation'.
Other countries, including Bangladesh, Pakistan, and particularly Turkey
which has 1,000 troops on standby, have offered reinforcements. But Mr
Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, has ruled against sending
troops from neighbouring countries.
The US, which has refused to send ground forces to Bosnia until a full peace
agreement is signed, was yesterday understood to be considering boosting its
force in Macedonia from 300 to 700. This would allow a 400-strong Nordic
force stationed in Macedonia to be sent to Bosnia.
France will offer more troops on a 'roll-over' basis, sending in forces
earlier to overlap with those on the ground. The Nordic countries said they
were prepared to re-deploy troops from Croatia.
General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, said
yesterday that some 50,000 western troops, half of them American, would be
needed to oversee any Bosnian peace agreement, Reuter reports from
Washington. He was challenging earlier reports that a smaller force of
20,000-30,000 troops, perhaps a third of them American, could monitor any
final peace deal.

FT  10 MAR 94 / France is in a budgetary bind, says the OECD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French economy will grow by 1 per cent this year, less than the 1.4 per
cent forecast by the Balladur government which may thus have difficulty
hitting its deficit reduction target, the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development warns in a report today.
The OECD says France needs to cut its interest rates further, and accepts
that it wants to do this only in conjunction with Germany, and assumes that
this will be possible.
But it cautions that 'if German interest rates fell by less than projected,
the French authorities would have to consider how to continue their policy
of gradual interest rate reductions while maintaining their stable currency
strategy'. It suggests that with 'no room for fiscal manoeuvre left' to
boost the economy through the budget, a further easing of monetary policy
would 'be the only way to support demand'.
While acknowledging the pick-up in consumption in the third quarter of last
year, the Paris-based organisation says the signs are 'the (economic)
decline has halted, rather than that a clear-cut recovery is under way'.
French government economists yesterday attributed the OECD's caution to the
fact that it, like every other forecaster, failed to predict the 1992-93
recession, and to the fact that its report does not take into account the
continued improvement in the last three months of 1993. This showed a 0.2
per cent rise in output, with an automatic 'carry-over' effect contributing
0.3-0.4 per cent to this year's growth.
Highlighting France's budgetary bind, the OECD suggests that the government
may be planning to restrain public spending too much for the short-term
health of the economy, but too little to fulfil the longer-term fiscal goals
set out in the Maastricht treaty for monetary union.
This discrepancy arises out of the fact that the government plans to bring
down its central budget deficit from FFr317bn (Pounds 36.31bn) last year to
FFr300bn in 1994, but has taken few measures to contain local authorities'
spending and to cut back social welfare spending. France aims to meet the
Maastricht goal of bringing overall public borrowings/deficits to 3 per cent
or less by 1997. But the ratio this year for France, the OECD predicts, will
be nearer 5.75 per cent of gross national output in 1994, rather than the
5.1 per cent government target.
The OECD criticises the tax system, despite recent reforms, as having too
narrow a base, too complex a structure and too steep a progression.
But the OECD endorses the government's moves to shift more of the cost of
the French welfare state off the backs of companies and their employees and
on to the state budget. However, it says the government may have to go
further than it did in 1993 in cutting pension benefits and much further
than it has in containing the cost of French healthcare.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Paris to privatise Bull and AGF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The French government yesterday confirmed that it plans to privatise
Assurances Generales de France (AGF), the insurance group, and Groupe Bull,
the troubled computer company, after the forthcoming sale of Union des
Assurances de Paris (UAP), the largest French insurer.
However Renault, the motor group, was omitted from the latest privatisation
list, published yesterday. Its absence appeared to confirm reports that Mr
Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, favoured postponing its sale until
after next spring's presidential elections.
Renault's omission fuelled speculation about a rift between Mr Balladur and
Mr Gerard Longuet, his industry minister. Mr Longuet said in an interview in
Tuesday's edition of Ouest France, a leading regional newspaper, that he
hoped the group would be sold 'as quickly as possible'.
However, Mr Balladur and Mr Charles Pasqua, the hardline interior minister,
are believed to have advocated delay on the grounds that the privatisation
could be politically sensitive at a time of rising unemployment and social
instability, given Renault's status as an historic battleground for French
workers' rights.
The delay also reflects concern about the condition of the French stock
market, which has been volatile in recent weeks. 'French equities are very
jittery,' said Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, chief French economist at Salomon.
'The French must be worried about the risk of swamping the market with yet
more equity.'
Moreover, the success of the first phase of the privatisation drive has
given Mr Balladur some flexibility over the timing of future issues. His
government originally budgeted to raise FFr55bn (Pounds 6.3bn) from its 1994
share issues. It has already yielded FFr33bn from last month's sale of the
Elf-Aquitaine oil group, with another FFr28bn expected from the UAP issue.
This means that the government will beat this year's financial target even
before selling its AGF stake, which should be worth FFr15bn. Mr Edmond
Alphandery, economy minister, yesterday said the proceeds of the AGF issue
were needed to recapitalise a number of state-controlled companies.
The value of the Bull privatisation is more difficult to assess given that
it is likely to be phased into several stages, including a small public
offer and the sale of minority stakes to industrial partners.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Economic Watch: Oil demand revised upwards
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The International Energy Agency forecast for oil demand in OECD countries in
the first quarter of 1994 has been revised upwards by 0.1m barrels a day, to
40.3m. European demand is expected to be temporarily subdued as a result of
very mild weather, but is projected to rise modestly in 1994, to 13.7m b/d,
from 13.6m in 1993. The IEA revised upwards European demand in the fourth
quarter of 1993 by 0.2m b/d to 14m b/d, but the agency said this reflected
an increase in stocks, rather than any underlying increase in oil
consumption. Further stockbuilding in Europe during January has left stock
levels 'above normal', the IEA said. Outside the OECD, demand in the former
Soviet Union is expected to decline by 0.6m bpd in 1994, from 5.6m bpd in
1993.
The Hamburg-based HWWA economic research institute has forecast real growth
of 5 per cent in German exports in 1994, after a 6 per cent fall in 1993.
East German exports should also grow, it said.
Western German retail trading sales fell a real 2 per cent in January from a
year earlier, and stagnated in nominal terms. Retail sales in January were
down an average 37 per cent from December.
Hungary's unemployment rate fell to 12.6 per cent in February from 12.8 per
cent in January, with the number of registered unemployed falling by 11,000,
to 630,600.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Voting row goes to heart of EU's fault lines: How a dispute
among the 12 has put the prospects for the 16 in jeopardy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Britain and Spain will come under intense pressure from their European
partners to settle the EU power-sharing dispute which threatens to prevent
four new members - Sweden, Finland, Austria and Norway - entering the Union.
Britain in particular, has been identified as the villain in sabotaging
prospects for the wider Europe it says it wants.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, Germany's foreign minister, mainly blamed the UK when the
enlargement negotiations broke up in rancour late Tuesday night, to resume
in Brussels next Tuesday.
London and Madrid, with lukewarm support from the Italians, insist on
keeping the weighted voting rules of the 12 - where two large and one small
countries combining 23 out of 76 votes can block measures - for a Union of
16. Their nine partners want to move the threshold to 27 out of 90 votes,
keeping the same, roughly 30 per cent proportion for the 'blocking
minority', after the four newcomers arrive.
'The Nine won't blink on the 27 votes,' Mr Piet Dankert, the Dutch minister
for Europe warned early yesterday.
British officials maintain that only the Benelux countries and possibly
France firmly oppose the UK and Spain, with a large pool in between for both
sides to fish in before next Tuesday. The known evidence from what has
nevertheless been a row behind closed doors suggests they are wrong.
First, the power-sharing issue goes to the heart of the divisions in the
Union which the Maastricht treaty failed to close: between North and South,
between big and small member states, between the sovereignty-conscious who
prefer inter-governmental co-operation, and federalists who want to tighten
European integration and make decisions at EU level easier.
But more immediately, countries like Germany and Holland - both with greater
right to complain about under-representation in the Council than the UK or
Spain - feel certain that the European Parliament will not ratify the
accession treaty if EU law-making is made more difficult by a shrinking
minority.
Parliament formally has to decide whether to go ahead today. This might be
stretched to next week. Much beyond that, however, and the January 1995
enlargement target could be lost, along with momentum in the applicant
countries which still have to convince their voters to endorse entry.
Although nobody disputes that the UK and Spain can block the decision, there
is a growing feeling in Brussels that Britain has misread the situation -
unless it is putting down markers now for the 1996 constitutional review to
which the 12 heads of government (including Mr Major and Mr Felipe Gonzalez)
in June 1992 remitted the votes issue.
Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, has suggested moving to 27 votes
for the moment, and for the 12 leaders to set up a committee to study vote
distribution ahead of 1996, specifically taking into account British,
Spanish, Italian, and also German concerns.
This looks like the only sort of framework which can resolve the dispute and
deliver a Europe of 16 next year - and the British and Spanish governments
can expect to be told so in no uncertain terms in the few days left.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Norway yesterday appeared unflustered by the hiatus in its fraught
negotiations on terms for entry to the European Union as the government
presented the wrangles within the EU on the talks as evidence that it was
driving a good deal for Oslo, writes Hugh Carnegy in Stockholm.
Mr Jan Henry Olsen, the Norwegian fisheries minister - given a virtual veto
on the country's entry terms by Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland - said
he would recommend acceptance of a proposed deal blocked only by Spain when
the talks stalled in Brussels. 'If Spain accepts the proposed solution on
fish already accepted by the 11 other EU members and Norway, I will say yes
to membership and recommend others to do the same,' said Mr Olsen formerly a
staunch opponent of Norwegian entry to the union.
In Stockholm, Mr Carl Bildt, Swedish prime minister, said he was not
concerned by the delay in Brussels. 'This is not a breakdown in
negotiations, but a one week delay. There is no reason to believe Sweden's
entry will be delayed,' he said.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Brussels to probe aid for airlines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission is to investigate the state aid which Portugal and
Greecehave offered to their national airlines, TAP-Air Portugal and Olympic
Airways.
The investigation is likely to fuel the long-running row between member
states over the Commission's efforts to curtail state aid to airlines - a
dispute that seems likely to gather pace with the announcement of a new
state package for Air France in Paris this week.
The Commission's investigation into TAP follows the Portuguese government's
approval two months ago of a Es180bn (Pounds 687m) aid package for the
airline, designed to bail out the loss-making group as part of a broader
restructuring programme.
This aid, which would absorb TAP's Es124,4 debts, will be allocated in four
tranches over the next four years, according to the plans submitted to the
Commission by the Portuguese government.
At the same time the Commission will examine the Ecu2bn (Pounds 1.51bn) of
state aid that the Greek government has offered to Olympic Airways. This aid
is to be split into two parts, with Ecu1.1bn designated to absorb Olympic's
previous debts and Ecu96m earmarked for future capital projects.
Commission officials said yesterday the investigations into state aid for
airlines were now almost standard policy, given the increasingly tough line
that the Commission has taken in recent years towards state subsidies in
European industry.
Last December the Commission approved IPounds 175m (Pounds 168m) aid for
Irish carrier Aer Lingus after a similar investigation, although it insisted
the aid could only be used to restore the company to financial viability and
could not be used to distort the market.
A more controversial investigation into the FFr1.5bn (Pounds 174m) of aid
for Air France is under way, with results expected in several months.
The question at stake will be whether the Greek and Portuguese aid
represents a 'one-off' attempt to make the airlines viable for future
competition, Commission officials said. Although they insisted that
'one-off' aid was still permissible, under Commission rules, aid that could
seriously distort the market would not be permitted.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Catalonia sees war of words as dangerous fantasy: A look at
the growing row over the Catalan language law which has been referred to
Spain's highest court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Scoop, the British writer Evelyn Waugh's seminal satire on journalistic
jaunts, a celebrated war correspondent sent to cover a revolution in a
Balkans capital oversleeps in his train carriage, wakes up in the wrong
city, blithely rattles off dispatches about flaming churches and dead
children, and succeeds in creating financial panic, famine and a revolution
on his hotel doorstep.
Waugh's fable resurfaced two weeks ago in an editorial on the Catalan
language question in the Barcelona newspaper La Vanguardia. Mr Jordi Pujol,
president of Catalonia's autonomous government, the Generalitat, since 1980,
has since seized the story to explain in subsequent press conferences that
the supposed row is a fantasy which could turn dangerous.
At issue is a Catalan language law, unanimously passed by Catalonia's
parliament 11 years ago in one of Mr Pujol's earliest legislative
initiatives, that has been referred by the Supreme Court in Madrid to the
Constitutional Court, an even higher Madrid-based judicial body whose 12
members are the watchdogs of civic rights and duties.
The Constitutional Court has to decide whether the language law infringes
the rights of Spanish speakers in Catalonia by forcing them to learn
Catalan, a language that the post-Franco constitution asserts is co-official
with Spanish in the area. It is expected to spend months pondering over its
ruling. In Mr Pujol's view there is no issue and no row - only interested
parties who seek to rock Catalonia's calm.
The Scoop-like correspondent creating the storm is a well-known extreme
right-winger in Barcelona and a lawyer, Mr Esteban Gomez Rovira, aided and
abetted by the conservative Madrid newspaper ABC.
Mr Gomez Rovira has been fighting legal battles to curb the growing use of
Catalan in the area's schools ever since the language law was enacted. In
1985 and 1987 he survived bomb attacks from Catalan extremists. His latest
assault, now before the Constitutional Court, follows what he terms 'a turn
of the screw by the Generalitat'. The twist by Mr Pujol's government, which
has so far gained the backing of the judiciary for its educational
initiatives, has been its insistence on Catalan-only schooling for children
up to the age of seven under a new policy called 'linguistic immersion'.
Mr Gomez Rovira sees the development as one step further in the creation of
a monolingual culture that will destroy 'the unity of Spain'.
ABC has given the lawyer a platform for his views ('it has made all the
difference', he says).
The newspaper claims that Mr Pujol is seeking to stamp out Spanish just as
Francoism sought to eradicate the language of Catalonia.
Surveys conducted by the Generalitat, and a succession of views in Barcelona
from a cross-section of native Catalans and of immigrants to the area,
suggest a very different picture to the one painted by ABC. The vast
majority are functionally bilingual; they do not question the Generalitat's
weighting towards Catalan and they are not 'unlearning' their Spanish.
Unlike other minority languages that have become nationalist emblems,
Catalan is a romance language that is easy to learn and, more importantly,
it is very much a living language that carries social prestige.
Immigrants from southern Spain, who swelled Barcelona dormitory towns such
as Santa Coloma from 12,000 in the 1950s to 140,000 today, wanted to learn
the language of the foreman on the building site and in the workshop.
Mr Pujol's education department claims that over the past five years the
percentage of Catalonia's 6m inhabitants that does not understand Catalan
has been reduced from 9.4 per cent to 6.2 per cent; nearly 94 per cent
understand Catalan, 68 per cent can speak and read it and 40 per cent can
write it.
The department's officials say that far from discriminating against
immigrants, the 'linguistic immersion' policy wants to ensure that children
from Spanish-speaking homes will have an equal opportunity in a schooling
system where more than half the subjects are taught in Catalan.
To date, less than 500 parents have backed Mr Gomez Rovira's campaign to
demand Spanish-language schooling with Catalan as an optional subject.
Mr Pujol believes that the cornerstone of continued calm and consensus in
Catalonia is the maintenance of the present impulse towards cementing a
bilingual society.
He fears that the Constitutional Court might, like Mr Gomez Rovira and the
Scoop journalist, wake up at the wrong station, and create an artificial
conflict by upholding a dual schooling system that would prove dangerously
divisive.

FT  10 MAR 94 / A tale of paper cod and accelerated cohesion fish: The Greek
handling of the talks unravelled the EU's Byzantine solution to the fishing
row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A dispute over the conduct of the talks, rather than the content of the
negotiations, appears to have stood in the way of the European Union
clinching entry terms with Norway late on Tuesday night, when ministerial
negotiations in Brussels on EU enlargement broke up in disarray
Mr Javier Solana, the Spanish foreign minister, walked out of the
negotiations for some two hours, irritated by the way the Greek presidency
of the EU presented Spain with what he evidently saw as a 'take it or leave
it' offer on access to Norwegian fish, without allowing time for the Spanish
to examine the details.
Spanish officials at the meeting nevertheless confirmed that they were
prepared to give serious consideration to the content of the offer.
The main obstacle to concluding terms with Norway is Spanish insistence that
it get back the 7,000 tonnes of cod its fishing fleet used to catch in
Norwegian waters before it was barred in 1981.
Madrid equally wants the cod Norway ceded to the EU as part of this year's
European Economic Area (EEA) free trade zone treaty 'consolidated' as part
of a permanent quota. This amounts to 7,250 tonnes this year, rising to
11,000 tonnes in 1997, with the so-called 'cohesion' or poor countries,
Spain and Portugal, getting 45 per cent each, and Greece and Ireland
splitting the rest.
But for over a year Oslo has unflinchingly refused to give up a single extra
fish. 'I will stand tall and firm and say No,' Mr Jan Henry Olsen, Norway's
fisheries minister, said on Tuesday, as Spain reiterated its threat to veto
Norwegian entry unless he budged.
The European Commission's alchemists, however, were busy working up a
seemingly impossible formula to save the face of both Madrid and Oslo. Its
main elements are:
To bring forward the 11,000 tonnes quota for 1997 to this year (these are
known as 'accelerated cohesion fish').
Under the EEA, the Union also gets 2.9 per cent of the total Norwegian
waters cod quota, or about 40,000 tonnes this year. But the cod stock is
rising because of careful Norwegian fisheries management, promising a higher
tonnage for the EU in coming years. Brussels wants to satisfy Spain's
demands by giving it these additional tonnes (known as 'paper fish', because
at the moment they are only there on paper).
Anticipating that Spain will not be satisfied, the Commission has also
looked at 'other people's fish'. Brussels suggests the Union buys a portion
of Russia's cod quota in Norwegian waters, allocate it to Spain, and pass
the bill through Oslo's contribution to the EU budget.
Norwegian officials, with whom this formula had to be worked out, were
obviously familiar with the details of this package; Spanish officials,
equally obviously, were not. When Mr Theodoros Pangalos, the Greek European
affairs minister chairing the EU Council of Ministers, presented Spain with
what it regarded as a fait accompli, Mr Solana took it as an affront and
left for his embassy.
Spanish officials say they need time to study the implications, but concede
that the Commission formula could turn dross, or at least cod, into gold.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Barclays considers default provisions to limit profit swings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays, the largest UK bank, is working on plans to even out cyclical
swings in its profits by making a small provision for default each time it
lends money. It hopes this will prevent large rises in loan provisions
during recessions.
Mr Martin Taylor, Barclays' new chief executive, is backing the initiative
although it was discussed before he took up his post full-time in January.
Barclays announces its 1993 profits today, after a Pounds 242m loss in 1992.
Banks suffered from an unprecedented swing in their profits in the five
years from 1987 because they boosted earnings by increasing loans rapidly in
the late 1980s. They were then hit by a wave of bad debt provisions in the
recession.
Banks carry general provisions against losses they expect from loans which
appear to be sound, but Barclays wants to make this more exact. It would
book a small loss against each loan, set according to the chance of it not
being repaid. The bank is trying to analyse the risks over full economic
cycles of particular types of lending, such as small corporate loans or
those to particular industries. Mr Taylor is thought to be keen to implement
the new approach next year.
Barclays' directors believe that by making loans carry a small provision
based on risk, they could discourage branch managers both from lending too
much during economic booms and refusing loans during recession.
However, the initiative could be hard to implement because of the difficulty
of assessing risk accurately. The move could also be opposed by bank
auditors, who might regard it as an attempt to smooth profits by mis-stating
earnings.
The bank could also increase its tax liability by making general provisions.
Specific provisions against loans clearly in danger of default are tax
deductible, but general provisions against expected loss are not.
Barclays signalled a move towards evening out volatility in profits when it
increased its general provisions by Pounds 118m in the first half of 1993.
It holds general provisions worth about 0.6 per cent of its loans and
advances.
Mr Taylor is thought to be keen to implement the idea in full. If Barclays
cannot gain approval from auditors, it might bring in the change internally
in separate management accounts.

FT  10 MAR 94 / IRA attack shatters peace hopes: Mortars fired on Heathrow
as MPs debate terror law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, JIMMY BURNS and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The IRA last night renewed its mainland terrorist campaign with a mortar
attack on Heathrow airport, shattering lingering hopes of an early peace
settlement in Ulster.
The provocative and potentially devastating attack, in which four mortar
bombs were fired from a hotel car park towards the airport's northern
runway, came as the Commons debated renewal of legislation to combat IRA
violence. MPs also voted to set up a new cross-party committee on Northern
Ireland issues.
The attack - in which no-one was injured - came on the eve of the latest
meeting in London of Irish and British ministers to prepare a blueprint for
a political settlement in the province.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, is likely to come under pressure in the
Commons today to make clear that the government's patience has run out in
waiting for a response from the republican movement to the Downing Street
declaration. MPs will demand that the government now enforces a new security
crackdown.
Last night's attack, which police said was accompanied with a recognised IRA
warning, caused widespread disruption at Heathrow, which is the world's
busiest international airport.
The four mortars, fired from beyond the airport perimeter, failed to
detonate, but two landed on the airport's northern runway. Aircraft
continued to take off from the runway for about 30 minutes after the attack
until it was closed by police.
Six-foot long tubes full of high explosives were used to fire the devices in
the attack about 400 yards from the runway. The devices were fired from a
Nissan Micra car just before 6pm from the Excelsior Hotel car park.
The attack, announced to the Commons by Mr Michael Howard, the home
secretary, provided a powerful reminder of the failure of last December's
Anglo-Irish declaration to halt the IRA's terrorism campaign, and again
demonstrated its ability to strike high-security targets.
London and Dublin have been hoping that Sinn Fein might persuade the IRA to
end its campaign of violence and enter the peace process.
But with its hopes apparently rebuffed, both governments will today make
clear their determination to press on with talks aimed at a political
settlement. Downing Street said last night that the declaration and the
principles underlying it remained intact.
The attack, the first time the IRA has used mortars in mainland Britain
since its attempt to bomb 10 Downing Street in 1991, coincided with the
House of Commons debate on the annual renewal of the Prevention of Terrorism
Act.
Mr Howard said he was 'deeply concerned' at what had obviously been a very
serious attack. He had called for a detailed report on the incident and
would see what lessons could be learnt.
As the Commons backed the renewal of the act by a margin of 86, Mr Howard
told MPs: 'I do not know whether that incident is supposed to send some
message to the House as we conclude our debate on these matters.'
He added: 'If it is, I know that there is only one conclusion that this
House can responsibly take. We know in unequivocal terms that the
Association of Chief Police Officers considers this act in its present form
to be essential in the fight against terrorism'. Earlier, an attempt by the
Labour party to establish a new cross-party consensus on the retention of
the anti-terrorism legislation ended in acrimony and recriminination in the
Commons.
Labour MPs were angered by Mr Howard's rejection of opposition calls for an
inquiry by a senior judge into the provisions permitting terrorist suspects
to be detained for questioning for up to seven days, and for those from
Northern Ireland to be excluded from mainland Britain.
Heathrow is an important economic target. In addition to handling more than
42m passengers a year, it employs 50,000 people - 1,400 of them security
staff - and supports an estimated 20,000 local jobs.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Air France plan likely to provoke EU row: French government
agrees fresh capital for state-owned airline to aid restructuring moves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

The French government is set to provoke a head-on confrontation with the
Brussels authorities and European countries, including Britain, by agreeing
to inject up to FFr20bn (Pounds 2.31bn) in Air France, the troubled French
national airline.
The government said yesterday it would approve a significant
recapitalisation for Air France if the state-owned airline's 42,000
employees and their unions approved a restructuring plan drawn up by Mr
Christian Blanc, the airline's new chairman.
The government refused to give details of the recapitalisation and
restructuring programme which the airline will unveil today. But it said Air
France had asked for 'a very large sum'.
French government officials would not confirm press reports that the airline
was seeking a FFr20bn capital injection. 'In the current state of things I
cannot confirm this figure. I simply want to tell you that the state has
decided to do its duty by Air France,' a spokesman said.
The EU has recently recommended an end to all state aid for European
airlines, but has agreed to allow financially strapped national carriers to
receive one last package of state support as long as they launch a thorough
restructuring programme.
But the size of the Air France plan is expected to set off a storm in
Brussels and other European capitals.
The UK government, along with British Airways and British Midland Airways,
has been stepping up its campaign against state subsidised European national
carriers, claiming that state aid was distorting competition in the
liberalised single European aviation market.
Air France, which lost FFr7.5bn last year and has debts of FFr37bn, has been
struggling to put together a restructuring programme to restore the airline
to a competitive footing and return it to profit.
An earlier restructuring programme involving 4,000 job cuts was rejected by
unions and led to the resignation of Mr Bernard Attali as Air France
chairman, after the government refused to back his strategy.
The latest attempt is not expected to involve compulsory redundancies, but
significant internal organisational changes. Both the French government and
the airline's new management have been at pains to avoid another politically
damaging confrontation with the airline's workforce and unions.
Mr Blanc's proposals are also expected to include eventual employee share
ownership in exchange for wage cuts and other productivity improvements.
The government indicated yesterday it would inject funds into the airline in
tranches.
The first would follow approval by the unions of the restructuring plan, and
subsequent tranches would be subject to the implementation of the programme.
Air France, which has lost money since 1989, has already received state aid
totalling FFr5.84bn in 1991 and 1992. The EU is currently investigating
another FFr1.5bn aid package made last year.

FT  10 MAR 94 / Ban on use of BT lines for TV to continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has ruled out any early lifting of the ban on British
Telecommunications using its network to carry television broadcasts, despite
BT claims that Britain risks losing out to international competitors in the
information revolution.
Mr Patrick McLoughlin, the telecommunications minister, has written to the
Cable Television Association, which represents the cable companies building
combined phone and television networks in urban areas, to reaffirm the
government's commitment to maintaining the restrictions on BT.
He said the government would stick to the terms of the 1991
telecommunications white paper, which imposed a ban on BT carrying
entertainment services in order to foster greater competition in
telecommunications.
The most significant part of the ban is the block on BT offering additional
TV over its network. It appears not to extend to video on demand.
The government's determination to curb BT emerged as Sir Iain Vallance, BT's
chairman, warned MPs that Britain would lose its leading telecoms position
in Europe unless BT went ahead soon with the construction of a national
fibre network.
Sir Iain told the House of Commons trade and industry committee, which is
studying options for such a network, that uncertainty over the future of the
enter-tainment ban was hampering BT in its investment planning.
'BT has a leading position in the UK in fibre technology,' Sir Iain said.
But its lead was 'partial and tenuous' and without a lifting of the ban it
was 'difficult' to see how BT could justify the Pounds 15bn investment
necessary to extend fibre to most of the country over the next decade.
The fibre would replace copper wires in the local networks, giving
flexibility and capacity for a range of new interactive services.
Sir Iain likened the possible consequences of failing to upgrade local
networks to the decline of the UK's manufacturing industry in the 1980s,
against competition from the Far East.
According to a senior Whitehall official ministers believe BT is engaged in
an elaborate bluff to secure an early lifting of the ban.
Under the 1991 white paper, BT is banned from carrying entertainment
services over its network until 2001, although Oftel, telecoms regulator,
can recommend lifting the ban from 1998.
BT is about to start a pilot project at Kesgrave, Suffolk, taking fibre
technology into 70 homes, providing services such as video on demand down
upgraded lines. Sir Iain agreed that a lifting of the ban in 1998 would not
significantly hamper BT.

FT  09 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Peace talks obstacles trip up the
bulls' stampede - Tel Aviv's change in fortunes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a bullish run of several months, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange has
entered a period of pessimism and caution as the market goes through a
crucial period of adjustment driven by political and economic uncertainty.
Since the boom of early January the TASE has been through a mini-crash with
a 12.5 per cent decline on the Mishtanim two-sided index of the 100 most
actively traded blue chip companies. The more speculative Karam index of the
smaller capitalised companies has fallen about 27 per cent.
From a high of almost 259 points in mid-January, buoyed by over-optimism
about the peace process, the Mishtanim index closed yesterday at 221.11, a
fall of 0.6. Analysts predict that the market will take several months to
recover.
Driving this decline of the market are four major factors: fear of further
increases in interest rates; a general feeling that the market was
overbought and making the shares, particularly on the Karam index, seriously
overvalued; the exposure of some of the worst insider trading and share
price manipulation since the 1983 bank shares scandal; and the political
uncertainty surrounding the peace process and the stability of the fragile
coalition government.
'The market was long overdue for a correction,' said Mr David Rosenberg, a
market analyst at Pacific Mediterranean Investments. 'But unfortunately
several things came at once.'
The conditions for a decline in the market were set last December when the
central bank, concerned about meeting an inflation target of 8 per cent for
1994, lifted interest rates to 11.5 per cent as inflation reached 11.2 per
cent. Although the market did not respond immediately, fear of further rate
increases has haunted investors. Those fears will have been boosted
yesterday following the publication of an International Monetary Fund report
warning of the possibility of further rises in interest rates to combat
inflation.
However, the real decline in the market started in February as big
institutional investors announced that many shares were overvalued, the
relation between financial results of companies and their market value was
disproportionate, and the market was overbought.
The movement of many large investors away from small Karam stocks towards
larger capitalised Mishtanim stocks coincided with the revelation of an
investigation by the Securities Authority of share price manipulation by
brokers and fund managers and the subsequent arrest of three portfolio
managers and the investigation of at least a further six. The impact of both
these developments was felt most heavily on the Karam index, where shares
were most overvalued and also more easily subject to manipulation.
Also, the peace euphoria which characterised trading throughout the
August-January period finally ran out as talks with the PLO became bogged
down. The massacre of Palestinians by a Jewish fanatic in Hebron two weeks
ago, followed by the suspension of PLO-Israeli talks, delivered a final
crushing blow to investor confidence.
'This is a peace market,' said Mr Goldberg. 'Everything hinges on that. The
future economic development of Israel is contingent on the peace process and
the market closely reflects that.'
Although recent new issues just about mustered a subscription, poor
conditions on the market have led the government to postpone for five weeks
the sale of Shikun U'Pituach, a state-owned property development company
valued at Shk1bn, until later this month.
However, many analysts believe the market has swung too low and that the
recent decline is only temporary and should be put in the context of the
fact that the Mishtanim index has climbed 785 per cent in the past five
years, having weathered four major falls but then quickly recovered.

FT  09 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Asea, BBC shares up on rumours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of Asea and Brown Boveri, the founding companies of engineering group
ABB Asea Brown Boveri, have surged on the annual pre-press conference
speculation that their directors will do the decent thing and order the
conversion of their paper into a single unified ABB share, writes Ian Rodger
in Zurich.
This time, the speculation originated in Stockholm, driving the Asea 'A'
shares up SKr20 to SKr581 on Monday, and by a further SKr6 to SKr587
yesterday when the Affarsvarlden index dipped 10.0 to 1,527.6. Zurich
arbitrageurs made sure that BBC bearers followed yesterday, showing a SFr19
rise to SFr1,129 as the SMI index fell 16.23 to 2,902.4.
ABB officials yearn for a single share to bolster the group's multinational
image, but the controlling families are in no hurry to create one.
The Swedish Wallenbergs now cast 33 per cent of the Asea votes with only 20
per cent of the capital, while the Swiss Schmidheinys speak for 14 per cent
of BBC with only 4 per cent of the capital.
In other Stockholm trading, Gambro was marked SKr15 lower to SKr399 in
reaction to results.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Bonn talks on Baltic tension: West to push Moscow on
withdrawal of ex-Soviet troops
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The foreign ministers of the three former Soviet Baltic states will meet
today in Bonn with Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, amid
growing concern in western capitals over Russian-Estonian relations as the
deadline for the withdrawal of Russian troops from the territory approaches.
Mr Kinkel has called for Russia troops to be withdrawn from Estonia and
Latvia on schedule, by August of this year.
The German minister said that the Russian side must not link the retention
of the military units to the provision of civil or voting rights of the
Russian population, as it has earlier threatened to do.
Similar calls have come in the past few days from the US and Britain. A US
state department spokesman said over the weekend that the US government was
'disturbed' by Russian negotiators raising again issues already agreed in
previous talks with Estonian officials.
The issue of troop withdrawals from the Baltics will be part of talks
planned between Russian foreign minister Andrei Kozyrev and Mr Warren
Christopher, the US secretary of state, in Vladivostok next Monday.
A British government statement said that 'according to the final act of the
Conference of Security and Co-operation in Europe meeting in Helsinki in
1992, Russia must withdraw its troops from Estonia quickly and in an orderly
manner, completely, and must not tie withdrawal to other issues'. The UK
statement continued: 'The international community has repeatedly underscored
that the withdrawal must take place without any other conditions. Therefore,
the Russian troops must be pulled out by August 31 this year, as announced.'
Mr Vitaly Churkin, the Russian deputy foreign minister in charge of
negotiations with the Baltic states, told the newly formed Chamber of Public
Affairs, a presidential advisory body, that Russia did not link the rights
of Russians to troop withdrawals.
However, he said that economic and other agreements with Latvia and
Lithuania would be affected by a continued denial of rights.
According to the Baltfax news agency, Mr Churkin promised that 'a civilised
and respectful attitude' towards Russian language speakers would meet with
'understanding and a response' from Russia.
However, other speakers at the chamber denounced the treatment of Russians
and demanded redress.
Mr Mikhail Zadornov, a well-known actor, said that Russians were being
denied access to education and medical care and were being sacked from jobs.

FT  09 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Waters in demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Water issues held up well as Credit Lyonnais Laing highlighted their
attractions. Analyst Mr Robert Giles said that on Monday afternoon the water
shares had moved to a yield relative of 150, a level not seen since the
general election.
He also pointed out that index-linked gilts, which the utilities tend to
track, had picked up. Mr Giles pinpointed Yorkshire, 11 higher at 536p after
547p, Severn Trent, unchanged at 556p after 572p, and Anglian 11 firmer at
515p, as his prime selections.
Property shares wilted in the weak market, undermined further by
disappointing end-December results from Wates City of London Properties.
Analysts said the slight increase in the net asset value to 72.8p was well
below market expectations of between 75p and 105p, although this was
tempered by the fact that much of the upward valuations in properties have
been in January and February.
Mr Graham Stanley at Goldman Sachs said: 'The recent shake-out among
property stocks has highlighted some areas of value for investors. But with
the uncertainties in the bond market, we remain cautious in the short term.'
Among the leading stocks, British Land fell 21 to 414p, MEPC 17 to 488p and
Land Securities 17 to 703p.
A trade press report that Air France might listen to offers for its Meridien
hotel chain prompted speculation in the market that Forte may be one
interested party. The UK group, still smarting from its recent failure to
land the Italian Ciga chain, is known to be keen to expand its international
portfolio.
Forte eased a penny to 268p. Talk over Forte's intentions towards the Savoy
Group saw the latter move up 37 to 1075p.
Standard Chartered was the pick of an uncertain banking sector, with the
shares building on Monday's strong performance and moving 16 higher to
1180p, partly reflecting increasing optimism over this morning's preliminary
figures, and the chances that the numbers could be accompanied by a share
split.
Also helping sentiment in stocks heavily exposed to Hong Kong and the Far
East was a story that Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, which has
triggered big moves in the Hang Seng index over the past year or so, was
preparing to increase its weighting in the Hong Kong market.
High street banks also held up well against the overall market, with some
leading brokers said to be preparing the case that the banks sector is ripe
for a rerating after its recent steep decline. The weakness across financial
sectors was triggered by fears of big losses in trading bonds and equities.
The takeover/rights issue speculation surrounding BAT led to renewed talk of
potential corporate moves in the UK composite and life sectors. Guardian
Royal Exchange, up a penny at 196p, was one of only a handful of FT-SE 100
stocks to close up on the session after speculators decided it could be a
prime target for attack.
Graham Group, the builders merchants hived off by BTR, made a scintillating
market debut. Offered for sale at 183p, Graham opened at 197p, marginally
above most expectations, and touched 203 1/2 p before easing to 202p by the
close. Volume reached 34m shares, easily the heaviest individual turnover in
the market.
Chemicals group Laporte was firmer after announcing full-year profits of
Pounds 107.4m, up from Pounds 86.6m last time. But the stock ticked back
with the market to end 20 down at 794p on uninspired turnover. Hoare Govett
raised its recommendation from hold to buy.
Reuters lost much of Monday's gain, sliding 56 to 2103p. Results at the high
end of some expectations sent marketing services group WPP up 2 to 125p. SG
Warburg forecast that WPP would 'exhibit 25 per cent average eps growth
between 1992 and 1996'.
News of losses at USAir, in which British Airways has a 24.6 per cent stake,
left shares in the UK carrier off 11 at 419p after trade of 6.3m.
Shares in Williams Holdings put on 8 at 409p, with Morgan Stanley said to
have had a big buyer of the stock.

FT  09 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Boddington talk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a busy drinks sector, Boddington attracted speculative interest on talk
that Whitbread may be considering a hostile bid for the pub retailing group.
Such a move would cost Whitbread in the region of Pounds 440m.
Whitbread already owns around 20 per cent of Boddington, inherited from last
year's share restructuring with the Whitbread Investment Trust, and under
the government's regulations it must reduce its holding or make a bid.
Analysts were divided over the speculation, some arguing that Boddington's
portfolio of public houses, hotels and nursing homes would not fit with
Whitbread's business. Boddington shot forward 18 on the talk, closing at
294p.
However, Whitbread, together with some other brewing stocks, retreated in
line with the market and also on a cautious note from NatWest Securities.
The broker argued that the weak earnings growth potential of the sector
pointed to short-term underperformance. Whitbread slid 10 1/2 to 550 1/2 p,
Scottish &amp; Newcastle 10 to 549p and Allied-Lyons also 10 to 625p.

FT  09 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Cash call rumours hurt BAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rumours of a record-breaking rights issue settled on BAT Industries, the
tobacco and insurance conglomerate. Many analysts were sceptical but BAT's
share price tumbled 23 to 470p on heavy turnover of 8.6m ahead of figures
due today.
The speculation was that Compagnie de Suez would sell its Groupe Victoire
insurance arm. BAT refused to comment publicly but was believed to have
refuted the story to City analysts, while Suez denied that it was selling
its stake.
One analyst said the speculation had a 'superficial charm' because BAT was
known to be trying to extend its financial services operations in
continental Europe. However, it was also pointed out that BAT had not made a
paper-funded acquisition for 20 years.
Some cynical marketmakers felt predictions that BAT planned a two-for-nine
cash call to raise Pounds 2.6bn had an over-precise ring. If true, it would
be twice the size of the existing rights issue record of Pounds 1.3bn set up
by Zeneca in June last year. Others argued that the market rarely reacts
without a reason, and that rumours of a link had been building for some
time.
Another market favourite for a possible equity fund-raising was Cadbury
Schweppes, which also reports results today. The company would need in
excess of Pounds 1bn to mount a bid for Dr Pepper, of the US. The Cadbury
share price was steady at 494p.

FT  09 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bond falls hit share prices towards
the close - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading stocks stumbled badly at the close of trading yesterday as bond
markets fell sharply and rumours circulated that a large rights issue was
overhanging equities. The FT-SE 100 Index, which had been moving nervously
all day, extended an earlier loss to close 41.5 down at 3,264.4.
Hints of a big fund-raising surfaced in the stock market early, and market
analysts identified several possible names among leading companies due to
report profits this week. BAT Industries, weak yesterday, and
Cadbury-Schweppes both featured prominently in the list.
A deeper reason for the late setback in equities was a sell-off in
gilt-edged securities, the second of the session. Uncertainty in bonds
across Europe reflected uncertainty ahead of the outcome today of the
Bundesbank's variable rate tender, which has turned attention once again to
interest rate prospects.
Strategists noted that bond markets were again exercising the power over
stock markets which lay behind the shakeout of the past two weeks. But they
said it was too early to say whether the equity rally of the two previous
sessions had been seriously challenged.
Shares opened higher but were quickly tripped up as derivatives markets
turned off when transatlantic houses sold futures instruments. The first
bout of selling in bonds then hit, driving the Footsie down by more than 23
points. Selling was modest and shares soon steadied as losses in gilts were
reduced.
UK economic data, showing an unexpected jump in manufacturing output in
January, and thus leaning against the likelihood of an early cut in base
rates, was a discouraging factor. However, traders said that the stock
market was content to take its cue from bond prices.
The final setback came very quickly and caused some analysts to suggest that
market confidence was 'surprisingly weak'. There was little time for selling
to spread across the range and the FT-SE Mid 250 Index finished only 14.6
down at 3,923.1.
The FT-SE 100 Index was hit by weakness among the pharmaceutical stocks,
which still command a strong following among fund managers. There was also
weakness in the utility sectors, which had proved resilient during recent
weakness in equities. Property stocks, too, took heavy casualties after a
progress report from a leading City of London group cast a cloud over the
supposed recovery in the commercial sector.
Seaq volume increased to 676.2m shares from Monday's 576.3m, which returned
a retail business worth of Pounds 1.25bn, at the lower end of average daily
figures. Traders stressed that there was significant selling pressure
yesterday and questioned whether the stock market was yet able to free
itself from the pressure exerted by bond markets across Europe.
The equity market is expected to face a test of its attempted recovery
today, when the outcome of the Bundesbank money market repo tender may give
a hint on the near term trend of interest rates in Europe.
A batch of results from leading British companies will also underline the
latest trends in dividends. Equities outperformed against government bonds
during the recent sell-off with the help of improved dividend payments from
the banking sector. This improvement in returns to equity investors is
expected to continue if the recovery in the UK economy takes hold.

The heavy fall in German bonds in afternoon trading brought a sharp retreat
in an already lacklustre derivatives sector, writes Joel Kibazo.
On the Liffe, early trading in the March contract on the FT-SE 100 which
opened at 3,295 saw the contract challenge the 3,300 level. But interest
fizzled out at 3,299 and a selling order from a leading US house reversed
the initial advance, leaving March to drift lower.
Further selling after the release of industrial and manufacturing production
figures dampened hopes of a reduction in interest rates. However, it was the
reversal in German bonds and the early falls in New York that brought the
heavy sell-off in March in the afternoon.
It closed at 3,249, down 46 from the previous close and at a 12-point
discount to its fair value premium to cash of about minus 8. Volume at the
official close was 13,632.
In the Liffe FT-SE Mid 250, volume in June exceeded that in the March
contract, which closed at 3,290. March traded 105 lots, against 200 in June.
On the OMLX, 9 lots were traded in the March Mid 250 and it closed at
3,923.10.
Liffe traded options saw volume of 32,399 contracts, of which 14,748 were
dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 2,500 in Land Securities.

FT  09 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow eases as airline stocks
turn lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices were flat to weaker in light trading yesterday as stock
market investors took their cue from an uninspired bond market, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 4.50 at 3,851.72, but
off its low for the session of 3,842.72. The more broadly based Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 slipped 1.03 to 465.88, while the American SE composite shed 1.38
to 467.68 and the Nasdaq composite declined 2.93 to 792.12. Trading volume
on the New York SE was 298m shares.
After achieving impressive gains on Monday - when the Dow climbed 24 points
 -the equity market was unable to maintain its upward momentum when trading
opened yesterday. This was in spite of a firm start for bonds, which edged
higher in the expectation that the Federal Reserve would not raise interest
rates soon.
Analysts said that, in the absence of fresh economic statistics, there was
little mot-ivation for investors to buy stocks.
Consequently, as soon as bond prices started to decline, turning an early
quarter-point gain on the benchmark 30-year bond into a quarter-point loss
by midday, stocks quickly followed suit.
The declines were most pronounced among Nasdaq issues, primarily because
they have outperformed the wider market in recent days and so were due for
some kind of sell-off.
Among individual sectors, leading airline issues were notably weaker after
Prudential Securities, the Wall Street brokerage house, lowered its 1994
earnings estimates for the five airline companies it covers, citing a new
round of fare-cutting in the industry.
The news left Delta Dollars 1 lower at Dollars 47 3/4 , AMR (parent of
American Airlines) down Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 61 1/4 , UAL off Dollars
1/2 at Dollars 128 and Atlantic Southeast (traded on the Nasdaq market)
Dollars 2 cheaper at Dollars 31 3/4 . The only stock to buck the trend was
USAir, which firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 9 1/4 , having already suffered
from heavy selling on Monday when it issued a profits warning.
Varity jumped Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 48 3/4 in busy trading after the
automotive, agricultural and industrial machinery maker announced a surge in
fourth-quarter profits to Dollars 27m, a result that exceeded analysts'
expectations.
The bigger cyclical stocks were mixed. Alcoa dipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars
74 3/4 , Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing edged ahead Dollars 1/2 to Dollars
104 7/8 and International Paper rose Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 74 1/4 .
Canada
Toronto stock prices closed on a mixed note following moderate trading. The
market opened slightly lower and continued to fall through to midday.
However, sharp gains among media-related issues, prompted by the
announcement in the early afternoon that Rogers Communications and Maclean
Hunter had reached an agreement on Rogers' proposed takeover of Maclean
Hunter, helped to fuel a subsequent recovery.
The TSE 300 composite index lost 5.4 on the day at 4,431.2, but advancing

FT  09 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Weaker bonds unnerve bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bond market weakness troubled a number of bourses, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT tried to ignore bunds as it majored in chemicals and banks, but in
the end equities had to concede a small defeat. The Dax closed the session
15.1 higher at 2,124.04; this was actually 8.11 down from Monday's post
bourse close; and yesterday's attempt at an after-hours rally failed, the
Ibis-indicated Dax ending at 2,125.47 after an afternoon peak of 2,140.05.
Turnover climbed from DM9.4bn to DM10bn. BASF rose DM5.70 to DM311 and
Hoechst by DM6.90 to DM315.50, respectively gaining DM4.50 and DM2.50 more
after hours. Mr Harry Jaarsma of Dresdner Bank in Frankfurt said that
dividend cuts of DM2 from both companies compared with consensus
expectations of DM3, and that there were strong recovery hopes for the
sector from the second half of this year.
Banks lost some of their fervour in the late afternoon but Commerzbank still
ended at DM357, after DM361, following a session gain of DM8 to DM355.
Expectations, ahead of today's repo tender, were that the rate could come
down into the 5.90 to 5.95 per cent bracket, after last week's fall from 6
to 5.97 per cent in the first variable bid tender for three months.
PARIS drifted, waiting for the outcome of today's German repo tender. The
CAC 40 index fell 3.46 to 2,216.43 and turnover rose slightly to FFr4.3bn.
Suez rose FFr8.20, or 2.4 per cent to FFr349.70 although the companied
denied rumours that its insurance subsidiary, Groupe Victoire, was about to
be sold, this time to BAT Industries of the UK.
In the retail sector, Carrefour climbed FFr75 to FFr4,145 after producing
strong results following Monday's market close. Remy recovered FFr4 of
Monday's losses to close at FFr238, following comment that Hong Kong's
higher taxes on spirits and champagne were less damaging that had been
assumed.
AMSTERDAM saw sellers coming into the market but generally managed to keep
at bay the persistent nerves triggered by a weakness in bonds. Most shares
managed to cling on to the sharp gains they made on Monday.
The AEX ended the day 1.85 points lower at 422.91.
A significant amount of the action came from US traders, according to one
broker.
KLM took a knock from US selling and fell back 80 cents to Fl 49.70.
Conversely, US dealers were keen on Philips and their buying edged up the
stock 30 cents to Fl 52.90.
Hunter Douglas, which enjoyed positive sentiment on Monday, fell back on
vague forecasts although results that although were in line with
expectations. Profit-taking weakened the shares further, and they slid Fl
3.10 to Fl 87.70.
MILAN continued higher but the mood remained tentative ahead of the
elections at the end of the month. The Comit index added 8.24 or 1.3 per
cent to 609.23.
Pirelli put in a strong performance but analysts said there was no news to
account for a rise of L71, or 3.3 per cent to L2,241. Benetton added L899 or
3.5 per cent to L26,728.
The banks saw profit-taking, Credito Italiano shedding L47 to L2,629 and BCI
easing L36 to L6,266. Telecoms issues continued higher on hopes that the
privatisation programme might be speeded: Sip rose L62 to L4,256 and Stet
was L86 ahead at L4,756.
MADRID followed the bond market lower, the general index easing 2.64 to
338.46 in turnover of Pta29bn. BCH fell Pta85 to Pta2,930 on Monday
evening's news that Moody's was considering a debt ratings downgrade for the
bank.
WARSAW advanced 2 per cent to a record high amid continuing demand for local
breweries in which German groups have taken stakes. The Wig index rose 299.6
to 20,760.3 although overall trading was described as subdued.
ISTANBUL slid 3.9 per cent in thin trading with many investors unwilling to
take fresh positions due to uncertainties over the outlook for the economy.
The composite index fell 582.32 to 14,506.39, for a two-day loss of 7 per
cent.

Industrial stocks stormed to their third successive peak in hectic trade
yesterday, taking the index 108 higher to 5,950, as bullish sentiment was
driven by strong demand from foreign investors, notably newly established
South Africa funds in the US, writes Matthew Curtin in Johannesburg.
The industrials sector carried the overall index to a new high of 5,118, up
46 on the day, as major mining financial counters also notched up sharp
increases, led by Anglo American, which added R1 at R228.50 for a cumulative
R38 advance since Monday last week. The gold shares index, however, shed 27
to 1,884.

FT  09 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Taiwan sinks 3.4% as
Kuala Lumpur rebounds

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
After gaining substantial ground on active buying by domestic financial
institutions in the morning session, share prices met large-lot arbitrage
selling and profit-taking, leaving the market only marginally higher on the
day, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 index closed 86.51 up at 19,898.39 after opening at the day's
low of 19,826.28 and peaking at 20,090.71 in the early afternoon on active
buying of Nikkei 300 stocks by a UK brokerage.
Traders said profit-taking ahead of the March book closing seemed almost at
an end, while some domestic institutions were starting to buy shares.
'The supply demand situation is becoming quite positive,' said Mr Nobuhiro
Kaneda, general manager of Daiwa Securities' equity division. He expects the
Nikkei 225 to close the month - the end of the current business year -
within the range of 19,000 and 21,000.
Volume totalled 320m shares, against 343m. The Topix index rose 8.22 to
1,616.32, while the Nikkei 300 edged up 1.92 to 298.39. Advances led
declines by 565 to 423, with 197 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei
50 index was 1.31 firmer at 1,339.98.
Mounting concern over the rice shortage prompted speculative buying of foods
stocks. Hopes that Japanese consumers would eat more bread supported bakery
and flour milling shares, with Yamazaki Baking rising Y50 to Y2,190 and
Nisshin Flour Milling gaining Y70 at Y1,290.
Frozen food and processed food makers were also firm, with Ajinomoto, the
leading food company, moving up Y10 to Y1,320 and Nichirei, a large frozen
food maker, advancing Y12 to Y719.
Banks, heavily weighted in the Nikkei 300, gained ground, with Industrial
Bank of Japan adding Y30 at Y3,280 and Sanwa Bank Y20 at Y2,190.
Profit-taking depressed the motor sector, which was previously higher on
foreign buying. Nissan Motor, the most active issue of the day, dipped Y10
to Y874 and Toyota Motor declined Y10 to Y2,070.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 5.73 to 21,957.94 in volume of 99.2m shares.
Roundup
Regional markets took divergent paths.
TAIWAN plunged 3.4 per cent on stop-loss selling triggered by the market's
failure to rally on Monday, the first day of trade after the central bank
raised the ceiling on foreign investment.
The weighted index opened lower and sank for most of the session, ending
190.91 down at 5,456.68. Turnover shrank to a moderate TDollars 55.45bn from
Monday's TDollars 80.75bn.
The financial sector, which had surged in recent days on speculative buying
by big investors, dropped 4.3 per cent, with China Development losing
TDollars 7.50 at TDollars 123.
KUALA LUMPUR staged a strong rebound in the afternoon to close higher,
helped by gains in overseas markets and news that the British High
Commission in Kuala Lumpur had denied reports that London was contemplating
retaliatory action against Malaysia's trade ban.
The composite index was finally 10.58 up at 1,056.30 after setting a low for
the day of 1,035.62 in the morning.
Petronas Dagangan made its debut, the shares rising to a high of MDollars
7.95 before closing at MDollars 6.95, compared with the MDollars 2.80 offer
price.
SINGAPORE recouped some losses on late bargain hunting after a slight
recovery in Malaysian shares traded over the counter. The Straits Times
Industrial index ended 3.56 lower at 2,240.18 but after a day's low of
2,221.96.
HONG KONG finished sharply higher, aided by bargain hunting, but trading was
thin as sentiment remained cautious. The Hang Seng index was finally 233.03
ahead at 10,294.58, having jumped more than 270 points in early trade after
an overnight rally of Hong Kong stocks in London.
AUSTRALIA strengthened as 556m shares were traded, with the All Ordinaries
index fin-ishing 27.0 ahead at 2,171.7.
NEW ZEALAND took its lead from Wall Street and the NZSE-40 capital index
ended 30.75, or 1.4 per cent, up at 2,226.08. But turnover of NZDollars 39m
was only about half the level seen earlier in the year.
MANILA turned back after a firm opening as weakness in Benpres sparked other
stock sell-offs. The composite index shed 17.25 to 2,637.03. Benpres lost 80
centavos at 9.70 pesos.
SEOUL slipped lower, the composite index declining 10.77 to 884.85. Shares
made a slight recovery on a bout of selective buying of blue chips and
issues with low price-earnings ratios towards the close, after dropping more
than 14 points in the early afternoon.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Markets Report: Peseta features idle day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Spanish peseta was under pressure yesterday after Mr Pedro Solbes, the
economics minister, said Spain would not be able to meet the Maastricht
convergence criteria for economic union, writes Philip Gawith.
The peseta fell to Pta82.33 per D-Mark, from Pta81.89 on Monday, after Mr
Solbes said Spain would be unable to reduce its public deficit to 3 per cent
of GDP by 1997 - a condition laid down by the Maastricht treaty for monetary
union.
The news was hardly a surprise, but it was enough to dampen sentiment on a
day when markets were stricken by a near paralysis of inactivity. Mr Nick
Parsons, chief economist at CIBC, said a 'very large magnifying glass' was
required to discern signs of life in the market.
Mr David Barrett of NatWest Treasury commented: 'The foreign exchange market
does not have too many ideas of its own. It is looking for some sort of
outside impetus to give it direction.' The calm in foreign exchanges also
reflects a return to stability in bond markets after the turmoil of last
week.
The main currency crosses were all stuck in very narrow trading ranges.
Dollar/D-Mark traded in the DM1.7125 to DM1.7190 range; sterling/dollar in
the Dollars 1.4865 to Dollars 1.4915 area and dollar/yen in the Y104.98 to
Y105.51 range.
Sterling failed to gain support from figures showing British industrial
production and manufacturing to be stronger than anticipated in January. It
finished weaker in London against the dollar at Dollars 1.4875 from Dollars
1.4906 on Monday.
The Spanish economics minister's comments unsettled the Spanish bond markets
and pushed yields higher. With a close relationship between the currency and
bond markets, this weakness spilled over into the peseta.
Analysts said there was perhaps also an element of delayed reaction to last
week's 50 basis-point cut by the Bank of Spain in its key money rate. The
market also clearly believes that the Spanish government is keen to lower
rates to stimulate the weak economy.
Also weighing on sentiment was the announcement by Moody's, the credit
ratings agency, that it might downgrade the paper of Banco Central Hispano.
Mr Chris Turner, currency analyst at BZW, said this had reminded the markets
of the problems of another leading Spanish bank, Banesto, which ran into
trouble in December.
UK economic data releases showed industrial production up by 0.8 per cent in
January for a year-on-year 4 per cent increase, and manufacturing output up
1.1 per cent from December. But sterling gained no support from this and
ended at DM2.5516, a pfennig down from Monday's close. Most of this weakness
came in a spate of late afternoon selling.
Mr Mark Austin, treasury economist at Midland Global Markets, said the
'slight rumblings' about Prime Minister John Major's leadership had been a
negative. 'The leadership talk has focused people's minds on the political
problems that might occur later in the year.'
Mr Turner said sterling appeared still to be suffering from the negative
fallout that followed last month's rate cut. Many in the market chose to
interpret that easing of policy as indicating a government view that the
pound should not be allowed to rise too high on a trade-weighted basis.
The D-Mark was fairly steady ahead of today's repo announcement, when the
Bundesbank will announce the terms at which it is prepared to put money into
the system. Banks are expected to have bid lower rates, encouraged by the
view that the Bundesbank will continue easing credit.
The lowest rate at today's allocation is expected to be in the 5.90 per cent
to 5.95 per cent range. Last week the Bundesbank switched to a variable rate
repo for the first time since mid-November.
It had been setting tenders at a steady fixed rate of 6 per cent since
December. The central bank allowed the repo rate to fall by 3 basis points
to 5.97.
The dollar traded quietly ahead of today's German repo announcement. It
finished slightly easier at DM1.7155 from DM1.7184 and against the yen at
Y105.225 from Y105.850. In New York it closed at DM1.7147 and Y105.25.
Affecting the dollar's fortunes is the view that, on the one hand, the
Bundesbank will only cut rates cautiously. On the other, although there is
little dispute that the next move in US rates will be up, the timing of this
is less certain.
Mr Parsons argues that having destabilised markets with its last move, the
Federal Reserve will be anxious to avoid a repeat performance when it next
tightens. This may require a more cautious approach.
The Bank of England did not operate in the early morning round yesterday
after forecasting a liquidity shortage of Pounds 800m in the UK money
market. In the afternoon it put Pounds 93m into the market through bill
purchases at the established rate of 5 1/8 per cent. It gave Pounds 515m of
late assistance.

copper concession

<TEXT>
Cambior of Montreal has won the concession to develop the Peruvian copper
deposits known as La Granja, in the northern department of Cajamarca.
It outbid three other Canadian companies - Cominco, Teck and Placer Dome -
as well as Cyprus Minerals of the US at public auction in Lima on Monday.
Cambior will invest Dollars 25m over a maximum of five years, with an
additional payment of Dollars 1m a year for the exploration option. It also
offered the Peruvian state a 5 per cent royalty on all future sales.
La Granja has mineral reserves of around 320m tonnes, averaging 0.78 per
cent copper and four grammes of silver a tonne. If feasibility studies prove
positive Cambior could invest Dollars 450m in an initial leaching operation
to produce copper cathodes. A concentrator plant would follow.
Mr Raul Otero, president of Mineroperu, the state company that owns the
deposit, said anticipated sales could top Dollars 300m a year. That would
mean Dollars 15m a year in royalty payments.

Mideast

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Aluminium Bahrain, the Gulf's largest aluminium producer, announced
yesterday that it was cutting annual output by 20,000 tonnes a year to help
support the market, reports Reuter from Manama.
Further reductions would depend to a large extent on a concerted approach by
the entire aluminium-producing community, it added.
'Several discussions have taken place among the Middle East smelters on ways
of supporting the present international drive to re-establish balance
between supply and demand in the primary aluminium market,' according to a
company statement. 'Following these discussions, Aluminium Bahrain has
decided to reduce production by 20,000 metric tonnes per annum.'
Alba produced a record 450,000 tonnes last year, after doubling its capacity
in 1992.
Western producers have announced output cuts totalling about 850,000 tonnes
since agreeing the multinational plan in January, and prices have risen by
8.5 per cent. But analysts have suggested that it will be difficult to reach
the cuts target of between 1.5m and 2m tonnes a year without the
participation of producers not represented at the January talks, which
include those in the Middle East.

Oil prices in London and New York slipped below psychological support levels
yesterday as traders saw little scope for any decisive action from this
month's meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
In London the benchmark Brent Blend for April fell below the Dollars 13 a
barrel barrier to Dollars 12.99, just 9 cents above the five-year low of
Dollars 12.90 reached last month. It later recovered in late trading to
about Dollars 13.05. In New York the Nymex price for April crude fell at one
point in early trading below Dollars 14 a barrel.
A rollover of the present Opec production quota of 24.52m barrels a day was
'. . . written into the price', according to Mr Lindsay Horne, a trader at
the London branch of Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank.
He said it was 'intuitively wrong for the market to go into an Opec meeting
below Dollars 13 a barrel, but the price could spike down to around Dollars
12 ahead of the meeting'.
The market perception that Opec would simply roll over its present quota
into the second quarter of the year was reinforced yesterday by news agency
reports suggesting that Iran was worried that any Opec production cuts would
be offset by sharply rising production from independent producers, such as
the UK and Norway.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: India prepares ground for
flower sales drive - Plans for a dramatic expansion in production and
exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
India has served notice that it intends to join the ranks of the major
flower producing countries in the next few years. Encouraged by the federal
government's decision to make floriculture a priority area for development,
a large number of established business houses and new entrepreneurs have
decided to grow flowers on a commercial scale for the export market.
'Like so many other tropical countries, India should have taken the
initiative to grow flowers scientifically on a commercial scale a long time
ago,' says one industry official. 'After all India has plenty of land, water
and sun to grow a large variety of flowers. But we should be able to make up
for the lost time.' The liberalisation of the import of technology and
mother stock plants will make it possible for India to grow flowers for the
world market, he says.
The Agricultural and Processed Food Product Export Development Authority has
estimated that of the nearly 34,000 hectares of land under floriculture,
only about 10,000 hectares are used to produce cut flowers. Experts believe
that it should be possible to commit as much as 500,000 hectares to
floriculture in the next few years. By amending the land ceiling act, which
allows corporations to acquire large tracts of land for horticulture, the
government of Maharashtra has set the trend for the other Indian states.
World trade in flowers, estimated at over Dollars 25bn, is growing at a
highly encouraging rate of 11 per cent a year. This has enabled countries
like Colombia, Guatemala, Brazil, Kenya, Thailand and Malaysia to expand
quickly the production base for flowers. In contrast, India's exports of cut
flowers, foliage and tissue culture plants amounted to a meagre Rs130m
(Pounds 2.75m) last year.
But in view of the strong interest of the Indian corporations in
floriculture, it is now felt that the flower export target of Rs1bn for
1996-97 'is too conservative'.
The locations identified for the development of intensive floriculture are
Pune and Nashik in Maharashtra, Bangalore in Karnataka, Thiruvananthapuram
in Kerala, Kalimpong in West Bengal and Shrinagar in Jammu and Kashmir. But
except for Pune and Nashik - which are close to the Bombay airport, where
APEDA has built cold storage facilities for flowers - the centres identified
do not as yet offer 'good international air connections', industry officials
point out.
The government, which has given a 25 per cent air freight subsidy on flowers
is talking to several foreign airlines about securing adequate cargo space
for flowers. It also has agreed to create the necessary infrastructure at
the major airports in the country for storing and handling flowers.
The Indian companies entering the flower business have chosen Europe,
south-east Asia and the Far East as their 'principal target markets'. The US
is the single largest market for flowers but 'India is not targetting it
because of the distance'.
'The most productive flower growing period in India is September to March.
This coincides with the peak seasonal demand for flowers in Europe, when
little is grown locally. We want to make the best use of this season,' say
the industry officials, who at the same time admitted of their many
handicaps. 'Our knowledge of constructing ideal greenhouses is limited. We
lack good plant materials.
'Without foreign technical know-how, we will not be able to produce flowers
for the world market. And our knowledge of flower marketing is practically
nil.'
But the liberal import of floriculture and tissue culture technologies,
greenhouses, mother stock plants and seeds are enabling the Indian companies
to make a confident start in flower business. As for marketing, most Indian
companies are seeking the assistance of Dutch companies to ensure that their
flowers realise good prices at the auction.

FT  09 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Gold steadies after touching
3-month low - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The GOLD price steadied after sliding overnight on Japan's announcement that
it was planning to sell about 90 tonnes of melted-down surplus gold coins.
In London the price hit a three-month low of Dollars 375.45 a troy ounce at
the morning fixing before ending at Dollars 376, down Dollars 1.60 on the
day.
At the London Metal Exchange COPPER was generally steadier but seemed
content to trade within a fairly static Dollars 1,900-Dollars 1,920 a tonne
range for three months delivery.
London Commodity Exchange May COCOA futures closed Dollars 12 up in London
up at Dollars 930 a tonne and traders thought fresh buying might be
triggered if it broke above Dollars 937.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Market economy bears fruit in
Budapest - A wholesale revolution has brought an array of exotic produce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Budapest's wholesale market, on the outskirts of the Hungarian capital,
offers a fine example of the remnants of the old eastern bloc sampling the
fruits of the market economy.
A steady stream of battered Lada cars processes through the damp spring
morning past stalls brimming with imported oranges, grapefruits and kiwi
fruit. The drivers - grocers and traders from the city - pause to see who is
offering the keenest price before chugging on.
The market, which provides 90 per cent of Budapest's fresh fruit and
vegetables, is a pioneer in the reconstruction of eastern Europe's troubled
agricultural sector, being the largest in the region and the first organised
along western lines.
Mr Gabor Demszky, the mayor of Budapest, was in London yesterday to sign a
Dollars 6.7m (Ecu5.9m) loan agreement with the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development to help provide the market with a cold store,
bigger parking and service areas and facilities for ripening bananas.
Thanks to the market, bananas have become an everyday fruit in Budapest,
says Ms Anne Bosche-Lenoir, the EBRD's project manager in Hungary. But the
problem is that 'the bananas are already yellow when they arrive, so the
value is being added somewhere else'.
The bank sees competitive wholesale markets as the key to reducing
distribution costs, creating efficient pricing and breaking the stranglehold
of Mafia-style operators on traditional east European production and
distribution networks.
It has received requests from Albania to Alma Ata for help in setting up
markets. But progress has generally been slow. Attempts failed in Moscow and
St Petersburg because of problems over land reform and resistance from
organised criminals.
Budapest was different. The city authorities had set up the market
themselves in 1991. They created a company to operate it, with shareholders
including a leading Hungarian savings bank, an agricultural co-operative,
whose land was taken over for the market, and several small companies, as
well as the municipality.
Within a year of opening, it had become severely congested. About 95,000
farmers, anxious to break with the discredited co-operative distribution
system and sell their produce direct, descended on the market in the first
summer, queuing for up to three hours to get in. Annual turnover rose to
350,000 tonnes, five times that of the old wholesale operations in the city
centre, and the market found itself handling half the country's fruit and
vegetable imports.
The EBRD, drawing on wholesale systems in France, Italy and the Netherlands,
stepped in to provide advice on reorganising operations. This included
setting up television screens to track prices and introducing a proper
accounting system. Then it agreed to fund part of the Dollars 26.4m
extension, allowing the city rather than the government to guarantee a loan
for the first time.
'Without our money, they wouldn't have been able to finance this
infrastructure,' says Ms Bosche-Lenoir. 'There's no long-term finance
available in Hungary.' To minimise the company's borrowing costs,
wholesalers are being asked to pay a lump sum for leasing rights before
construction begins in May.
The market has been a blessing for Mr Gabor Czeizler, managing director of
Wienimpex, a wholesale operation distributing greenhouse produce from
south-east Hungary. He has seen his annual turnover nearly double since he
moved out from the city centre. 'This place is reachable from all
directions,' he says. 'There's a very good network of roads.'
Mr Lajos Juhasz, who works on a stall in the covered part of the market, is
glad of its existence too. He used to be deputy manager of a butcher's shop,
but the state meat company that owned it went bankrupt and he was out of a
job. 'The money is better but the hours are very long,' he says. The market
has also spawned rivals in other cities, which has made the competition
tougher.
For the people of Budapest, the increased availability not only of exotic
fruits but also of peppers, one of Hungary's most typical vegetables, is
welcome. 'Now we can buy tomatoes and peppers in the winter,' one woman
explained. 'They come from Holland, but they don't have the flavour of our
own Hungarian peppers.'

FT  09 MAR 94 / Government Bonds: Recovery ends as investors reduce their
risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The fragile recovery in European government bond markets ended yesterday,
with 10-year bonds shedding about a point in most markets.
'Although markets had consolidated over the last few days, investors are
still very nervous and are using the strength to off-load (long) positions
while speculative funds are re-establishing short positions,' said Mr Keith
Edmonds, chief analyst at IBJ International.
'There's a much greater awareness of risk in the market,' said Mr Jouni
Kokko, international economist at S. G. Warburg Securities. 'Many long-term
investors have had their belief in the bull market story shattered and
prefer to reduce their risk on any uptick,' he added.
Market participants are keenly awaiting the Bundesbank's allocation of
variable-rate securities repurchase agreements today. Most traders expect a
small drop in the minimum repo rate to around 5.90 - 5.92 per cent from last
week's 5.97 per cent. In the event of a small reduction, 'we could see a
brief rally, but people would probably look to sell at that level rather
than buy,' said Mr Kokko.
Weaker US Treasuries and rumours of near-term monetary tightening by the US
Federal Reserve also put pressure on European bonds.
German bunds set the pace, with most activity centred in the futures pits,
where trading was very technical. The June future broke several key support
levels on its way down. 'Each time we approached a support level, the
contract went through it like a hot knife through butter,' said a German
dealer. The contract hit a low of 96.40 and stood at 96.60 in late London
trade, down 0.83 points on the day.
Bunds dramatically underperformed their Dutch counterparts, which have seen
less foreign selling in recent weeks.
'Foreign holdings in the German market were massive, while at the long end
of the Dutch curve, domestic holdings have outweighed,' said Mr Torsten
Bohler, senior bond analyst at UBS. 'Dutch domestics are holding on to their
paper, while German domestics can't absorb all the paper sold by the
internationals.'
The Dutch 10-year benchmark yielded some 10 basis points below its German
counterpart yesterday, after being only 2 basis points below two trading
days earlier.
The release of stronger than expected industrial output data got the UK gilt
market off to a bad start and prices slid further in the afternoon on the
back of weaker bunds. The June long gilt futures contract on Liffe fell by
about 1 3/32 points from Monday's close to 112 9/16 .
French bonds also slid, fuelled by domestic selling. All eyes are on the
Bundesbank's repo, which is seen to set the pace for much-needed rate cuts
in France.
On the Matif, the March bond futures contract ended at 126.22, down 0.46
from Monday.
Japanese government bonds rose on late short-covering in Tokyo and continued
to post small gains in London trading. However, sentiment remains subdued by
trade tensions between Japan and the US as well as supply concerns.
After firming at the opening, US Treasury prices edged steadily lower across
the maturity range yesterday, undermined by a stronger retail sales report.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/4 at 92
11/32 , to yield 6.853 per cent. The two-year note was down  3/32 at 99 7/16
, yielding 4.910 per cent.
Trading was quiet from the start, although prices did post modest gains in
the first few hours of business.
The market, however, could not maintain its early upward momentum, and as
soon as the buying petered out, prices began to decline. The selling
intensified in the afternoon following the release of a
stronger-than-expected weekly retail sales report from the Johnson Redbook
service.

FT  09 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: S&amp;P cuts ratings of Japanese
banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Standard &amp; Poor's, the international credit rating agency, has lowered the
debt ratings of Industrial Bank of Japan and Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan,
two of Japan's leading long-term credit banks, because of their larger than
expected exposure to bad loans.
The agency lowered IBJ's senior debt rating from AA minus from A plus, while
LTCB's senior debt ratings were cut from A to A minus.
S&amp;P said substantial write-offs will ultimately be necessary by IBJ to
resolve its bad loans to housing loan companies. However, the write-off
process has been limited due to IBJ's earnings levels and the limit on the
sales of its cross-shareholding portfolio.
LTCB's downgrade reflects the large amount of restructured loans, or loans
on which the bank has lowered or waived interest to help restructuring, on
top of Y731bn in non-performing loans.
Meanwhile, S&amp;P has also downgraded the claims-paying ability ratings of four
non-life insurance companies and two life assurers. Japan's non-life
insurance sector is suffering from reduced profitability due to higher loss
ratios, insufficient premium rates and greater catastrophe costs. Increased
competition is also expected to hurt the country's life assurers.
The claims-paying ability ratings of Chiyoda Fire &amp; Marine, Dai-Tokyo Fire &amp;
Marine, Nichido Fire &amp; Marine, Nippon Fire &amp; Marine, Yasuda Mutual Life and
Meiji Mutual Life were downgraded to AA plus from AAA.

FT  09 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: Russian securities licence
for CSFB unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CS First Boston's Russian subsidiary has been granted a securities licence
by the Russian ministry of finance.
The licence allows the firm to trade and underwrite equity and debt, and is
the first to be granted to a foreign-owned institution.
The bank's main focus will be on the over-the-counter stock market, where
turnover is currently an estimated Dollars 800m a month, according to Mr
Boris Jordan, co-head of the Russian subsidiary.
Mr Jordan expects Russia's capital markets to expand rapidly, due to growing
interest from emerging market investors. He predicts financial investment of
around Dollars 5bn in Russia this year.
Other foreign banks have been slow to follow CSFB's lead in Russia, citing
lack of sufficient flows of business and infrastructure difficulties. But Mr
Jordan insists that CSFB's Russian subsidiary 'has been a profitable
operation from the start'.
Merrill Lynch of the US is increasing its presence in China with a second

Mr Li Peng, China's premier, urged Mr Daniel Tully, Merrill Lynch chief

Merrill Lynch is now a chief underwriter of Chinese company shares and

FT  09 MAR 94 / International Bonds: Turkey postpones Dollars 750m global
offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recent price weakness in government bond markets claimed another victim
yesterday when the Republic of Turkey pulled its Dollars 750m global bond
offering at the eleventh hour. Two weeks ago, a heavy fall in US Treasuries
led the National Bank of Hungary to delay its global offering.
Joint lead manager Salomon Brothers blamed poor market conditions for
Turkey's postponement. It said US Treasury yields had risen five basis
points since price talks with the borrower earlier in the day.
Turkey had considered inserting a three-year put option into the 10-year
offer to make it more palatable. Although price talk was around 250 basis
points over the yield on 10-year Treasuries, the put meant Turkey would have
to pay 350 basis points over three-year Treasuries. This was thought too
high.
Although Turkey decided to wait for better conditions, syndicate managers
reported a wide range of borrowers making enquiries about raising funds in
the Eurobond market.
The Inter-American Development Bank confirmed that it was considering a
Eurobond offering in sterling, the proceeds of which would be swapped into
Swiss francs. The 10-year bond was likely to raise around Pounds 125m and
could be launched this week provided agreement could be reached on terms.
The bank said S. G. Warburg was involved in the discussions. Price talk was
10 to 15 basis points over the yield on 10-year UK gilts.
The main deal was a Pounds 250m offering of five-year Eurobonds from Chubu
Electric Power of Japan. The pricing of the bonds, to yield 40 basis points
over five-year gilts, was described as generous in the light of the
borrower's superior credit rating. Joint lead manager S. G. Warburg said
realistic pricing was needed to re-open the market after the recent fall in
bond prices.
Nevertheless, syndicate managers said the pricing was not enough to ensure
swift placement and estimated that only half of the bonds had been sold by
the close of business.

FT  09 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: BCH under review for
downgrade by Moody's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Moody's, the US credit rating agency, has placed Banco Central Hispano,
Spain's largest bank in terms of assets, under review for possible
downgrade.
The development affects about Dollars 2.5bn of debt, and BCH's share price
fell 3.3 per cent yesterday in Madrid. The bank is currently rated A1 and
Prime-1 for long and short-term certificates and Prime-1 for commercial
paper.
This is the first move by a rating agency on a Spanish bank since the
Banesto crisis broke last year. The Spanish central bank sacked Banesto's
board after finding that it had grossly overvalued its assets. Banesto is to
be sold to a domestic bank next month.
Moody's said it would focus on BCH's core earnings, including its reliance
on non-recurring earnings, on the quality of its assets and on the progress
of a cost reduction programme that followed the 1991 merger between Banco
Central and Banco Hispano Americano that created BCH.
BCH's net interest income narrowed in 1993 and its operating profit margin
was significantly boosted by strong trading revenues earned during last
year's volatile interest rate and currency movements.
Bad debts, which were above 7 per cent of its loan portfolio, eased slightly
and BCH claims now stand at 6.8 per cent, below the sector average.

FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Valeo earnings steady at FFr705m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Valeo, the French car parts company, yesterday said it had managed to
maintain profits last year in spite of the depressed state of the European
motor market.
The group made net profits of FFr705m (Dollars 199.5m) in 1993 against
FFr700m in the previous year. As a result the board proposed raising its net
dividend to FFr8 from FFr7 in 1992.
Valeo, like other suppliers to the European motor industry, has been
affected by the downturn in demand. It sustained a 2 per cent fall in sales
during the year to FFr20.2bn compared with FFr19.8bn.
However, it said that it had managed to outperform the rest of the market by
limiting the fall in its European sales to 10 per cent during a year in
which the European market declined by 16 per cent.
The group increased car part sales in North America and Asia. The proportion
of its exports sold outside Europe rose during the year to about 22 per
cent, against just 16 per cent in 1992.
One of the main reasons for the improvement in Valeo's net margins was the
reduction in its financial costs due to a decline in its borrowings. The
level of net debt fell to FFr1.16bn by the end of 1993, from FFr2.15bn for
the same period in 1992.

FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Death of a golden chance -
Robert Champion de Crespigny speaks to Kenneth Gooding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While Mr Robert Champion de Crespigny, chairman of the Australian Normandy
Poseideon group, yesterday celebrated his unexpected victory in the hostile
and contested bid for Aztec Mining, he was also quietly burying another
important deal.
Poseidon Gold, the subsidiary through which the Aztec bid was launched, also
hoped to build a big gold business outside Australia via a joint venture
with Metall Mining, the Canadian subsidiary of Metallgesellschaft of
Germany.
It was forecast that the new PosMetall Gold would emerge in three or four
years with an annual output of 300,000 troy ounces of gold from a global
spread of precious metal interests. PosMetall would then have been floated
in North America and Australia.
This plan, however, has crumbled following the recent financial collapse of
Metallgesellschaft. Mr Kajo Neukirchen, new chief executive, has made clear
he intends to sell Metall. Mr de Crespigny said it was impossible to go
ahead with the proposed joint venture because he did not know who would
control Metall. 'It is safe to assume that the deal is dead,' he said.
Nevertheless, a joint venture gold project under way in Turkey with Metall
would continue. Poseidon had expected the Turkish project to be producing in
time to fill a predicted dip in its gold output. However, production there
had been delayed by permit problems, so the bid for Aztec was made to fill
the gap.
When the Aztec offer seemed like failing, Poseidon bought 40 per cent of the
Boddington gold mine in Western Australia for USDollars 116m (ADollars
83.45m) from Reynolds Metals of the US. This deal has been challenged by
another Boddington shareholder, but Mr de Crespigny said he was sure
Poseidon would take the stake.
Poseidon's main interest in Aztec was its Bounty gold mine, half-way between
Perth and Kalgoorlie, where Poseidon operates Australia's biggest single
gold mine, the Superpit.
The bid will also contribute to Normandy Poseidon's strategic objective of
having within five years three core divisions - gold, base metals and
industrial minerals - each capable of producing annual operating profits of
ADollars 50m.
It will give the group control of Golden Grove, which owns the Scuddles zinc
mine and also brings with it the Woodcutter mine. Between them, they have an
annual output of 200,000 tonnes of zinc. However, Mr de Crespigny said it
was not certain that Woodcutters would be kept by his group, which would
certainly sell Aztec's coal interests.
He said there was no need for Normandy to raise new capital to cover the
Aztec deal, and that the group's net debt would be virtually eliminated by
the end of this year.
Mr de Crespigny faces two areas of uncertainty: his relationship with the
Anglo American Corporation of South Africa, which owns nearly 20 per cent of
Normandy, and charges brought by the Federal director of public prosecutions
over the 1989 takeover.
Anglo recently reshuffled its assets and handed its Normandy stake to
Minorco, its Luxembourg-based subsidiary.
Mr de Crespigny, who rarely gives press interviews, said the relationship
with Anglo was 'very special,' and he expected it to continue that way.
However, Minorco had only 5 per cent of its assets in Australia and would
obviously want more.
'How that will come out I don't know,' he said.
He also admitted there was likely to be some competition for global projects
between Normandy and Minorco. Normandy is concentrating on Australia,
Indonesia, Vietnam and Laos. South America was too far away and a move into
Africa, on Anglo's doorstep, would, he said, 'be like kicking sand in your
mother-in-law's face'.

<TEXT>
The Hongkong Aircraft Engineering Company (Haeco), the aircraft maintenance
subsidiary of the Swire Pacific Group, has reported a 15 per cent increase
in profits, to HKDollars 447m (USDollars 57.8m) for calendar 1993 from
HKDollars 387.9m the previous year. It attributed the rise to improved
margins.
Profits rose on the back of good use of facilities, boosted productivity and
stringent cost controls, the company said. Line maintenance revenues
improved as Haeco took in hand a 12 per cent bigger slice of aircraft
movements at the colony's Kai Tak airport. Concerns over the high level of
inflation in the colony, of around 8.5 per cent, have prompted the drive for
enhanced productivity.
Earnings per share rose to HKDollars 2.41, against HKDollars 2.09 in 1992.
Shareholders are to receive a dividend of 71 cents, up from 64 cents the
previous year. The results were in line with market expectations.
The company said it was continuing talks with the Provisional Airport
Authority over a licence to operate maintenance facilities at the new
airport at Chek Lap Kok. At the same time, it is anticipating that volumes
at Kai Tak will continue to rise and expects to be able to secure healthy
levels of work this year.

FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: De Beers raises dividend 7% as
earnings climb

<TEXT>
De Beers, the South African company which dominates the world diamond trade,
is lifting its total 1993 dollar dividend by 7 per cent. The lift confirms
the stout turnround in the diamond business from the difficult conditions in
1992.
The dividend is increased to 84.4 US cents a share from 79.1 cents in 1992.
Earnings rose 16 per cent to 230 cents from 199 cents a share.
The shares reacted strongly to the news, climbing to a new high of R116 on
the Johannesburg stock exchange, before retreating to R115 at the close. Mr
Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman, said he was 'pleased' with the results,
which were underpinned by the first increase in four years in global retail
diamond sales.
The group's Central Selling Organisation (CSO) sold a record Dollars 4.37bn
in rough diamonds in 1993, against Dollars 3.42bn the year before, led by
good demand in the US and east Asia. Mr Jeremy Pudney, CSO marketing
director, said Korea, Taiwan and Thailand had overtaken France and Germany
as the group's most important markets after the US, Japan and Italy.
However, demand in Japan and Italy remained weak.
Mr Gary Ralfe, a director, said the group's relationship with Russia
remained uneasy, although sales in December of uncut diamonds from the
country's Treasury stockpile - in breach of a marketing agreement between De
Beers and the government - had not been repeated so far this year.
Pre-tax income rose to Dollars 789m from Dollars 728m, reflecting the
overall improvement in the jewellery trade and an increased contribution
from South African operations, boosted by the build-up to full production at
its new Venetia mine.
Mr Ogilvie Thompson said results from Centenary, De Beers' Swiss-based arm,
were hit by retrenchment costs at Namibian mines and the Irish-based
industrial diamond division, plus its smaller share of total diamond sales
as Venetia's output increased.

FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Australian TV network cautious
in spite of rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kerry Packer's Nine Network Australia, the country's dominant commercial
TV operator, yesterday announced an after-tax profit of ADollars 48.51m
(USDollars 34.9m) for the six months to end-December, up by 25.3 per cent on
the same period of 1992-93.
However, Nine warned that the increased costs associated with covering
overseas sporting events - including the Winter Olympics and the current
South African cricket tour - would peg its second-half profit at around last
time's figure.
'The directors are not anticipating a second-half result significantly above
last year,' said the company.
Nine Network said its earnings before interest and tax rose by 15 per cent
to ADollars 72.7m, with TV advertising increasing by over 10 per cent,
mainly in the first quarter.
Total group revenue stood at ADollars 312.4m, compared with ADollars 288.1m
last time - an increase of 8.4 per cent. Nine said the slower overall
increase reflected the sale of the Perth radio stations and flat revenue
growth at Sky Channel.
Ashton Mining, the Australian diamond producer, yesterday reported a net
profit of ADollars 36.6m in 1993, up from ADollars 35.4m the previous year.
The 1993 figure is scored after an ADollars 11.8m net abnormal item (nil in
the previous year). Ashton said the performance was 'particularly pleasing,
given the lower diamond sales revenue resulting from the full-year impact of
the CSO deferred purchases in 1993'.

for Aztec Mining

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The ADollars 287m (USDollars 206.5m) battle for Sydney-based Aztec Mining,
the metals group, came to an abrupt end yesterday. PosGold Investments, part
of Mr Robert Champion de Crespigny's Normandy Poseidon group, snapped up
more than three-quarters of its shares in a stock market raid.
The victory came just a day after PosGold lifted its cash offer for Aztec
from 68 cents a share to 74 cents, and waived certain conditions, allowing
it to buy its target's shares in the market.
No sooner had dealing opened yesterday, than it was announced that Alumax,
the US group which held a 37 per cent interest in Aztec, had sold its shares
to PosGold at the higher price. By late afternoon, PosGold said it had
raised its interest to around 85 per cent of Aztec's equity.
Aztec directors, who had previously recommended an all-paper merger with
Pancontinental Mining, reluctantly urged other shareholders to follow suit.
They acknowledged that the fall in Pancon's price since its bid was
announced meant that offer was worth less than PosGold's.
'While directors do not believe that the revised PosGold offer reflects the
full value of Aztec, in view of the fact that control of Aztec will now pass
to PosGold the directors recommend to shareholders that they accept the
revised PosGold offer of 74 cents per share, rather than the Pancontinental
offer,' they said.
Aztec shares ended the day six cents higher, at 74 cents, while the bid's
success lifted PosGold by 14 cents, to ADollars 3.20. Pancontinental also
gained. Its shares rose 12 cents to ADollars 1.82.

FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Rogers wins control of Maclean

<TEXT>
Rogers Communications, Canada's leading cable TV operator, has finally won
Maclean Hunter, a leading Canadian and US cable and publishing group, with a
bid worth about CDollars 3bn (USDollars 2.2bn).
Rogers yesterday raised its five-week-old offer from CDollars 17 to CDollars
17.50 per share and extended the expiry date from March 15 to March 31.
This delay was needed because the US Federal Communications Commission must
rule on Rogers' proposal to sell-off Maclean Hunter's US cable interests, a
ruling which could not be received by March 15.
Maclean Hunter shareholders will get CDollars 17 a share, plus 50 cents a
share to be paid via a special dividend from Maclean Hunter, assuming the
Rogers' bid is completed. But they will not share in the proceeds of the
sale of Maclean Hunter's US cable network.
Both Mr Garfield Emerson, chairman of Rogers, and Mr Ronald Osborne,
president of Maclean Hunter, said the price was fair. The Maclean Hunter
board recommended the offer to all its shareholders. Maclean Hunter's poison
pill shareholder protection plan will be waived.
Rogers has said it would sell Maclean Hunter's US cable interests to reduce
debt assumed for the takeover. It has also said it may sell Maclean Hunter's
Canadian publishing interests, since its primary aim was to get control of
Maclean Hunter's valuable Canadian cable business concentrated in southern
Ontario.

FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Australian insurer to sell
Californian unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
C. E. Heath International, the Australian liability insurer which was spun
off from its UK-based parent via local stock market flotation in 1992, is
selling C. E. Heath Compensation and Liability Insurance Company (or Heath
Cal), its Californian workers' compensation subsidiary, for ADollars 132m
(USDollars 94.3m).
The purchaser of the business is Care America, a subsidiary of UniHealth
America. The sale, according to the Australian group, should generate a
pre-tax profit of about ADollars 30m and is likely to be completed during
the next few months.
C. E. Heath International said the funds generated from the sale would be
ploughed back into expanding its interests in Australia, the UK and Asia.
It mentioned growth possibilities in the Australian workers' compensation
market - 'both Victoria and South Australia are expected to provide such
opportunities in 1994-95' - and in liability and travel insurance in the UK.
Other areas targeted for expansion include marine insurance and the Asian
markets.
News of the sale came as C. E. Heath announced a profit after tax of
ADollars 38m in the 12 months to end-December. This compared with ADollars
16.3m in the previous year. Net premiums were ADollars 371.1m, up 27 per
cent, and there was a small underwriting profit of ADollars 4.6m.
Heath said operating profit before unrealised gains on investments and tax
stood at ADollars 40.3m, up from ADollars 38.6m last time. Net unrealised
gains on investment increased by ADollars 31m before tax, to ADollars 17.7m,
and accounted for ADollars 11.8m of the after-tax profit.

Pohang Iron and Steel (Posco), the world's second largest steel company, has
changed its senior management for the third time in 18 months.
The unexpected appointment of Mr Kim Mahn-je, a former deputy prime minister
for economic affairs, as Posco chairman at the company's annual meeting
followed the sudden resignation of Mr Chung Myunk-sik as chairman and Mr Cho
Mal-soo as president.
They are reported to have resigned in protest over government interference
in the management of the company, whose largest shareholder is the state
with 35 per cent.
Mr Kim is the first outsider to head the profitable steelmaker, which was
established in 1967, and his appointment may provoke criticism from the
company's trade union.

FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Ticklish business of disclosure
 -All may not be best for Hong Kong banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The reporting season for Hong Kong's banks, now virtually complete, has been
notable for the extent to which disclosure grabbed the attention of
investors.
Two of Hong Kong's local banks, Hang Seng Bank and Bank of East Asia, both
suffered, the latter because investors got tired of management being
high-handed in its refusal to part with any information, and the former
because investors did not like what they saw.
To add to bankers' worries, there emerged a lobby to end past privileges.
The Consumer Council assailed the banks for reaping monopolistic profits
from rigging interest rates on small deposits; it also called for greater
disclosure of banks' inner reserves. According to Mr Roger Edgley, banking
analyst at Crosby Securities: 'Hong Kong has one of the lowest levels of
disclosure; even banks in Indonesia reveal more.'
Bank of East Asia, celebrating its 75th anniversary this year, got caught by
investors' doubts after it unveiled a HKDollars 1bn (USDollars 129m)
after-tax profit, some 46 per cent up on 1992's earnings. Given the paucity
of information it published, analysts speculated that 1993 earnings had been
bolstered by the use of past reserves.
Mr David Li, the bank's chief executive, was forced to issue a denial the
day after the bank released its results; weeks later he was still having to
explain himself. According to Mr Li, 1993 profits were augmented by the
unwinding of previous provisions for bad and doubtful debts.
Hang Seng's problem was the opposite: too much disclosure for the market's
liking. It had always been known that Hang Seng had a portfolio of
securities, but not one with a value of HKDollars 12.4bn, including
unrealised gains of HKDollars 9.6bn. As one broker wryly observed: 'Buy Hang
Seng as a geared play on the market.'
More seriously, analysts were concerned that Hang Seng recorded virtually no
growth in its underlying banking business, in spite of its position as the
premier retail bank in the colony.
According to Mr Steven Li, banking analyst with brokers Jardine Fleming,
Hang Seng's profit growth was attributable to lower bad debt charges, a
one-off reduction in staff costs, and trading profits on the equities
portfolio of more than HKDollars 1bn. With bank regulators and investors
concerned about banks' exposure to Hong Kong's property market, Hang Seng is
set for a period of soul searching, he says.
'Hang Seng has made its money the same way as the rest of Hong Kong, through
the property and stock markets. But there are limits to property lending,'
he says.
The Hong Kong banking sector divides according to size. Hongkong Bank and
Hang Seng Bank, its 63 per cent-owned listed subsidiary, dominate the
market. Next come the medium-sized banks, led by East Asia and including Dah
Sing and Dao Heng.
The third sector, the minnows, is where the greatest number of listed banks
lie. These small banks enjoyed very strong profits growth on the back of
expanding balance sheets. For most, 1993 profits grew by rates in excess of
40 per cent, compared with the majors whose profit growth was in the teens.
These high growth rates are, however, relatively easy to sustain for banks
which are at an early stage of the growth cycle. Their size also allows them
to behave in ways which regulators may find unacceptable in large banks.
There is, for example, evidence that some of the small banks are raising
funds outside the interbank money market. They are going directly to large
corporate clients of competitors and bidding deposits off them, sometimes at
rates as high as one percentage point above interbank rates.
Hong Kong's benign interest rate outlook is, however, about to change. The
US Federal Reserve Board signalled last month a change in the direction of
interest rates; Hong Kong cannot remain immune from higher interest rates
for long as its currency is linked to the dollar.
But Hong Kong is a highly profitable place for sellers of retail financial
services. This was underlined by the results of Manhattan Card Co, the
recently floated credit card subsidiary of Chase Manhattan Bank in the
colony, which posted a 73 per cent rise in net profit to HKDollars 154.7m
last year. Hong Kong is a place where people like to spend money.

FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Australia seeks to simplify
buy-backs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Michael Lavarch, the Australian Attorney-General, yesterday released a
proposed simplification of rules for corporate share buy-back schemes. The
changes could encourage more Australian companies to consider the option.
Although share buy-backs are permitted in Australia, they are subject to
complex conditions. Critics of the current regulations claim compliance
costs are heavy, and the safeguards against abuse are unnecessarily
detailed. As a result - and in contrast to the US, where buy-backs are
commonplace - few Australian companies have attempted to introduce such
schemes.
Under the new proposals, companies would be able to buy back shares, other
than redeemable preference shares. However, directors would have to sign a
written declaration stating that, in their opinion, the company would be
solvent immediately after the buy-back. They would be personally liable if
the buy-back led to insolvency.
A company would also be allowed to buy back more than 10 per cent of its
ordinary shares in a 12-month period, provided shareholders approved.
Restrictions on the source of funds for buy-backs would be eased, as would
accompanying constraints on the timing of new issues - for example, under
dividend reinvestment plans. At present, any company operating a dividend
reinvestment plan is effectively barred from a buy-back scheme.

FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Fourth-quarter rise boosts
Varity shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Varity rose sharply yesterday after the US automotive,
agricultural and industry machinery group reported a big improvement in
fourth-quarter net income to Dollars 27m, or 59 cents a share, on a
fully-diluted basis. A year ago, Varity earned Dollars 11.2m excluding
extraordinary charges.
The results were well above Wall Street analysts' expectations, and Varity
shares leaped Dollars 4 1/4 to close at Dollars 48 3/4 (a new 52-week high)
on the New York Stock Exchange.
The strong final quarter took 1993 profits to Dollars 76.3m, up from Dollars
33.4m a year earlier. After taking a non-cash charge to cover changes in
accounting principles, however, the company recorded a net loss of Dollars
71.5m in its latest fiscal year.
Mr Victor Rice, chairman and chief executive, said the accelerating recovery
in the North American automotive industry - the chief market for Varity's
brake products - was the main factor behind the earnings improvement, while
cost containment measures continue to help the group weather the impact of
the recession in Europe.
Among its three business segments, the automotive products business,
Kelsey-Hayes, made the biggest contribution to earnings growth in the final
quarter, posting operating income of Dollars 22m on sales of Dollars 297m.
Last year, Kelsey-Hayes earned Dollars 16m on sales of Dollars 249m.

Trilon, a financial services subsidiary of Toronto's Hees-Edper group,
reduced its 1993 loss to CDollars 38m (USDollars 28m), or 74 cents a share,
from CDollars 331m, or CDollars 3.90, in 1992, writes Robert Gibbens in
Montreal. The results include special charges of CDollars 107m, against
CDollars 433m, for Trilon's share of losses by Gentra, the former Royal
Trust Co.
Before special charges, Trilon was profitable in the fourth quarter of 1993
and expects to remain in the black through 1994. The real estate brokerage
has been restructured, and merchant banking reduced.

battle scars

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Paramount Communications, the film and publishing group being acquired by
Viacom after a Dollars 10bn takeover battle, yesterday reported a
third-quarter net loss of Dollars 36.6m, due largely to disappointing
audience figures for some recent film and television shows.
The loss was in line with a forecast loss of Dollars 35m to Dollars 40m
which Paramount made last month in the final stages of the takeover battle
between Viacom and QVC Network, the television home shopping channel.
QVC yesterday reported fourth-quarter net income of Dollars 2.8m, or 6 cents
a share, down from Dollars 18.9m, or 40 cents, in the same period of last
year, after taking Dollars 34.8m of pre-tax costs (an Dollars 18.8m net
loss) for its unsuccessful Paramount offer.
However, QVC's operating income in the fourth quarter was 34 per cent
higher, at Dollars 53.2m, compared with Dollars 39.5m, on revenues up 9 per
cent at Dollars 372.5m, compared with Dollars 341.8m. Fourth-quarter net
income also included a Dollars 1.1m extraordinary charge from the
accelerated write-off of debt placement fees.
Mr Barry Diller, chairman, said the results confirmed QVC's core business
was strong and 'though obviously somewhat distracted while pursuing
Paramount, we have not been deterred from our strategy to put in place an
aggressive plan for growth in both our basic business and the emerging world
of inter-activity'.
For the full year, QVC reported net income of Dollars 59.3m, or Dollars 1.18
a share, compared with Dollars 55.1m, or Dollars 1.24, on sales 14.2 per
cent higher at Dollars 1.22bn.
Paramount's third-quarter net loss, which worked through at 31 cents a
share, compared with a net loss of Dollars 66.8m, or 56 cents, in the same
period of last year, when it took a Dollars 66.9m one-time charge for an
accounting change. Revenues were Dollars 1.01bn, up from Dollars 943.7m.
For the first nine months, earnings totalled Dollars 180.6m, or Dollars
1.50, against Dollars 149.9m, or Dollars 1.26, the previous year.

<TEXT>
Brazil's Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD), the government-controlled mining
company and the world's largest iron ore exporter, yesterday launched an
American depositary receipts (ADR) programme on the US over-the-counter
market.
The company said the Level 1 programme was the first step towards a Level 3
ADR issue, which would involve an increase in capital and listing on a US
stock exchange, but imposed much stricter accounting requirements.
Under yesterday's operation, each ADR represents 250 CVRD preferred shares,
which have limited voting rights.
CVRD is Brazil's largest exporter, with net sales of Dollars 2.45bn last
year. Its share price increased 162 per cent in dollar terms in 1993 and has
grown by 43 per cent this year, helped by a very strong local market. Morgan
Guaranty Trust, a subsidiary of J. P. Morgan, is acting as sponsor.
Sakura Bank, a leading Japanese bank, has announced that it will issue
Y100bn (Dollars 945m) in convertible preferred stock to boost its capital
levels, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
It will be the first Japanese bank to issue preferred stock since the
finance ministry eased restrictions on capital-raising programmes using the
instruments last year.
The bank said its capital-to-assets ratio would rise by 0.5 percentage
points to 9.6 per cent after the issue, which would enable it to expand its
balance sheet by increasing lending.

FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Time for USAir to face the music
 -Labour cuts could be its last chance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is so long since USAir, the sixth biggest US carrier, made an annual
profit that shareholders must have forgotten what it feels like. On Monday,
they learned that this is not the year in which their memories are going to
be refreshed.
Not only did USAir dash hopes that it would share in the recovery taking
other big US airlines into modest profits; it warned that its sixth
consecutive year of losses would take it even more heavily into the red than
last year's Dollars 349m pre-tax.
The serious question now facing USAir's shareholders - and none more so than
British Airways, which has spent Dollars 400m since early last year to buy
and maintain a 24.6 per cent equity stake in the airline - is what future
awaits such a poorly performing company in a market suffering so badly from
overcapacity.
The precedents do not augur well. More than 100 airlines have gone bankrupt
since the US airline industry was deregulated in 1978, many of them bigger
and better known than USAir. Braniff International, Eastern Airlines, Trans
World Airlines and Pan American World Airways are just a few.
Nor has the cut-throat competition in the US domestic market shown any signs
of alleviating. If anything, it has grown worse, as overcapacity has enabled
new operators to enter the industry by picking up redundant aircraft and
crews on the cheap.
USAir's main markets are in the eastern US. Its primary hubs are in
Charlotte, Pittsburgh, Baltimore and Philadelphia, all of which have direct
flights to New York's JFK international airport where they connect with
British Airways flights.
USAir has always suffered the disadvantage that its routes are predominantly
short-haul in an industry where the revenue-to-cost ratios are more
favourable on long-haul routes. Until recently, however, it had drawn
comfort from the fact that many of its routes were effective monopolies.
That started to change last year when Southwest Airlines, the biggest and
most successful of the new breed of low-cost airlines, moved into its
market, setting up a rival hub in Baltimore. Things got worse in January
when Continental Airways, fresh out of bankruptcy with a new, low-cost
structure, announced that it was introducing its so-called Peanuts Fares to
many routes in the east.
USAir was left with no alternative but to slash its own fares, which it duly
did last month. But the inevitable consequence will be that its already very
serious losses will grow still further, unless it can significantly cut its
costs - and that means getting its labour unions to accept drastic cuts in
jobs, wages and conditions of employment.
Seen against that background, it becomes clear why British Airways is
threatening not to fulfil its agreement to take its stake in USAir to 44 per
cent in the next four years by investing another Dollars 450m. Until now,
USAir's labour unions have had little reason to accept the need for drastic
cuts because if the airline ever got into really serious trouble, British
Airways would be there. Now, British Airways has taken that security away.
Within hours of these developments on Monday, USAir's management had met
representatives of its four labour unions and asked them to start talks.
Some indication of the scale of the cuts that will be needed can be gleaned
from the fact that its operating costs of 11.2 cents per available seat mile
in last year's fourth quarter were more than 50 per cent higher than those
of its competitors.
If the experience of other large US carriers offers an example, one likely
outcome of the negotiations will be a deal under which a substantial
proportion of the airline's equity is sold to its employees in return for
labour concessions over a period of years. Under similar deals, employees
have already taken 37.5 per cent of Northwest Airlines and 45 per cent of a
restructured TWA, and are due to receive 53 per cent of United Airlines.
Such action may be the least unattractive alternative. Mr Kevin Murphy, an
analyst at Morgan Stanley, the Wall Street investment bank, points out that
no US airline yet has lost as much as USAir without either reaching a deal
with its unions - or going bankrupt.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Rhone-Poulenc, the recently privatised French chemicals group, is
reactivating plans to take full control of Institut Merieux, the Lyon-based
pharmaceuticals company.
Last October, the two companies announced terms for an offer whereby
Rhone-Poulenc, which owns 51 per cent of Merieux, would buy all the
remaining shares.
However, the offer was suspended in December when Pasteur Merieux, a
subsidiary, was forced to stop production of its albumine vaccine because of
regulations over the collection of human placentas, the basic raw material.
Under the terms of the original offer Rhone-Poulenc was to offer 77 of its
own shares for every five Institut Merieux shares. Under the new offer, the
chemicals group is offering 15 shares for each share in Merieux.
Merieux is a world leader in the development of vaccines. However, it is a
relatively small player in an intensely competitive industry, with net
profits of FFr396m (Dollars 67.1m) on sales of FFr6.6bn in 1992.
Rhone-Poulenc said at the time of its initial offer that it expected, by
taking full control of Merieux, to benefit from potential synergies between
their human and animal health businesses.

FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Foreigners eager for Czech
sell-offs - Shares in 861 groups are on offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM and ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech prime minister, offered British businessmen a
plethora of uplifting quotes from Adam Smith, the 18th century prophet of
laisser faire capitalism, in London yesterday. But he had little concrete to
offer those seeking an easier way through the Czech bureaucracy to
potentially lucrative contracts and participation in the privatisation of
Czech industry.
The Czech Republic, he told a luncheon audience organised by the Adam Smith
Institute, British Gas and Bass, the UK brewer, had an embarrassing surplus
of foreign capital. The central bank was having to neutralise the inflow by
domestic monetary manoeuvres. Czech companies were looking forward to the
time when they would be investing abroad in foreign assets, not just
absorbing foreign capital, he added.
It was a tongue in cheek performance, and the audience loved it. Foreign
investors have indeed been buying Czech companies and shares on the rising
Prague bourse. They are closely following the outcome of the second wave of
voucher privatisation which begins next month and should be completed this
summer.
Shares in 861 companies with a book value of Kcs155bn (Dollars 5.3bn) are on
offer, compared with about 1,000 companies worth more than Dollars 7bn last
time. But interest has been lively with over 6m Czechs out of a population
of 10.3m registering for voucher books.
Only Czech nationals can participate in the voucher scheme, but foreign
investors are poised to move in on targeted companies once the process has
been completed. Most will deal directly with investment funds, several of
which have links with leading foreign institutions such as Credit Suisse
First Boston, Corus of the US, Austria's Creditanstalt and Raiffeisen banks,
and Epic, a Vienna-based fund.
The 400-plus funds played a large role in the first privatisation wave,
winning control of 72 per cent of privatised shares. They compete fiercely
to persuade investors to entrust them with the management of their
portfolios.
Incentives for investors include promises of returns several times the
Kcs1,000 cost of a voucher book, cheap loans and credits and other benefits.
At least one fund has offered an immediate cash payment of Kcs7,000 with
another Kcs1,000 promised later to buy the rights of voucher book holders,
thereby getting around a ban on investors selling the books.
Foreign investors are locked out of the initial process, but they can buy
shares from funds and individual shareholders once privatisations are
completed. They can buy shares on the stock exchange or the rival
over-the-counter RM-System, although lack of market liquidity and listed
stock reduces opportunities. Stakes in companies can be bought directly from
the government or the government-owned National Property Fund, as many large
privatisations involve a mix of vouchers, and sale by public tender or
direct sales.
Companies to be privatised include:
SPT Telecom: 26 per cent to be sold by vouchers. The government will decide
shortly on a short-list of foreign partners to be offered a 27 per cent
stake, although a partner is unlikely to be chosen before 1995.
There is strong interest from foreign telecommunications companies. SPT had
net profit of Kcs3.5bn on revenues of Kcs18.4bn last year.
CEZ: about 4 per cent of the its share capital will be sold by vouchers; 30
per cent was sold in the first wave. CEZ is one of the country's largest
companies with a quasi monopoly of power generation - competition comes from
a few small power plants run by municipalities.
It expects pre-tax profits of Kcs18.5bn on operating revenues of Kcs49bn for
1993. It is one of the most popular stocks on the market, given blue chip
status by foreign analysts, although the company could face environmental
problems. Chemopetro and Kaucuk Kralupy: two refineries which have attracted
strong interest from Shell, and a separate consortium of Conoco, Agip and
Total.
Some 36 per cent to be sold by vouchers, and at least another 30 per cent to
be reserved for a foreign partner.
Kablo Kladno: cables manufacturer; 66 per cent to be sold by vouchers, an
additional 30 per cent reserved for Felten and Guillaume of Germany.
Karosa: bus and truck manufacturer; more than 50 per cent to be sold by
vouchers, with about 36 per cent sold to Renault Vehicules Industriels.
Synthesia: the country's second largest chemicals company manufacturing
organic chemicals and explosives including Semtex. Has switched most of its
exports from former Comecon trade bloc to the West. Profits of Kcs199m on
sales of Kcs4.6bn last year.
With the range of companies narrower than in the first privatisation,
competition is expected to be strong for favoured stocks.
For international institutional investors, the second wave offers an
opportunity to raise their holdings in one of eastern Europe's fastest
growing emerging markets. About Dollars 200m in portfolio investment has
moved into the Czech Republic since last June, and more is expected.
'There could be another Dollars 500m waiting to come in through
institutional funds,' says Mr Peter Galbraith, an analyst with Epic.

FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Hoechst and BASF cut dividends
as earnings fall
</HEADLINE>

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hoechst and BASF, two of Europe's biggest chemicals concerns, yesterday
announced reduced dividends and earnings for 1993. BASF cut its pay-out to
DM8 from DM10, Hoechst to DM7 from DM9.
Although the German-based groups provided little more than basic 1993 data
yesterday, the results further encouraged share traders who have shown
increasing interest in the recovery value of cyclical stocks, notably
chemicals makers.
Sales and earnings figures from both groups suggested the rate of decline
had slowed during the past year, while national economic growth figures,
released yesterday, helped reassure markets that the worst of the domestic
recession was past.
Hoechst shares, up DM6.90 to DM315.50 at the end of official trading,
continued rising after hours, while BASF had risen DM5.70 to DM311 by the
close.
Group pre-tax profits at Hoechst fell 42 per cent to DM1.23bn (Dollars
723m), after being 50 per cent down after six months. Turnover, which was
2.4 per cent lower at the half-way mark, rose 0.4 per cent to DM46bn.
The company complained of price pressure and very low European demand, which
was evened out by improved overseas business. Net group earnings were 36 per
cent lower at DM756m.
The weakness of domestic markets was highlighted by a 58 per cent slump in
pre-tax earnings and a 7.6 per cent fall in sales at the German parent,
Hoechst AG.
A similar pattern emerged at BASF's parent, where German turnover fell 9.6
per cent, and pre-tax earnings were 16 per cent lower. Group sales were down
3.3 per cent at DM40.57bn, after being 7 per cent lower after six months.
Pre-tax profits, 50 per cent lower in the first half of the year, were down
15 per cent at DM1bn.
Both groups pressed ahead with savings programmes last year, shedding 10,000
employees between them. Further job losses are expected. Analysts expect
more joint ventures, disposals of non-core, unprofitable businesses, and a
search for profitable new ventures.

FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: GM Europe operations depressed

General Motors' Opel/Vauxhall car and light commercial vehicle operations in
Europe suffered a 56 per cent fall in net profits to Dollars 600m in 1993.
Mr Louis Hughes, GM Europe president, said in spite of the decline the
Opel/Vauxhall operations had remained the most profitable volume car
business in Europe for the fourth year in succession. Several of GM's
closest rivals in Europe suffered big losses last year.
Mr Hughes said the Opel/Vauxhall financial performance had been depressed by
one-off charges totalling about Dollars 800m arising from restructuring
measures and exchange rate losses.
The Opel/Vauxhall workforce was cut by about 7 per cent to 84,900 people at
the end of 1993 from 91,500 at the end of 1992 and there was widespread
short-time working at several GM Europe plants.
Mr Hughes warned that little growth was expected in the west European car
market this year, although a stronger recovery could begin in 1995 with
sales forecast to exceed 12m next year. According to industry estimates new
car sales in west Europe fell by 15 per cent last year to 11.45m units.
Mr Hughes said GM was planning to further internationalise its operations
using the Opel car operations as the spearhead.
The Opel technical development centre in Germany was the group's lead design
and engineering organisation outside North America.
Opel designed products are being built in eastern Europe, the Middle East,
Asia, Africa, South America and Australia.
Mr Hughes said GM Europe was planning small volume assembly projects in
India, Indonesia and Thailand and eventually in Malaysia. In the long term
studies were being conducted that could lead to Opel car assembly in China,
Russia, Zimbabwe and the Philippines.

FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Buoyant Sandvik sees market
growth in 1994

Sandvik, the Swedish speciality steel and carbide group, yesterday reported
a 30 per cent increase in profits for 1993, saying a four-year decline in
demand for industrial products was over.
'There are now clear signs that the world market will expand during 1994,'
it said.
Mr Per-Olof Eriksson, group chief executive for more than 10 years, would be
retiring in May, it said. He would be succeeded by Mr Clas Ake Hedstrom,
head of Sandvik Tooling.
With market conditions again weak last year, the company relied on the fall
in the krona and restructuring to lift profits to SKr1.98bn (Dollars 253m)
from SKr1.52bn. The improvement was achieved in spite of a sharp drop in
financial income, partly because of lower interest rates.
Sales rose 26 per cent to SKr21.8bn in 1993, in spite of lower volumes in
all business areas except steel. Excluding currency factors and structural
changes, sales were down 5 per cent, largely because of depressed demand in
Europe, which accounts for 55 per cent of sales.
Orders rose 28 per cent to SKr22.1bn, but only process systems showed a
clear increase in volume terms.
Star performer last year was the steel division, which lifted profits to
SKr461m from SKr159m.
The group's biggest division, cemented carbide, lifted profits to SKr1.28bn
from SKr879m, helped by currency factors. The saws and tools division was
weakened by the performance of a German unit, Sandvik Belzer, but losses
were cut to SKr3m from SKr82m.
The dividend is being increased to SKr2.25 per share from SKr1.90. Earnings
per share rose to SKr4.90 from SKr4.20. The group expects both sales and
profits to rise this year.

FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Continental declines to DM74m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax earnings at Continental, the German tyre maker, fell more than half
to DM74m (Dollars 43.5m) last year, according to Mr Hubertus von Grunberg,
group chairman.
He blamed the decline in the automotive industry. He said the company
increased volume deliveries, but prices had been depressed by over-capacity
in the tyre industry.
The results had once again been burdened by losses at General Tire, the US
subsidiary, which had not fulfilled its promises to return a break-even
result, he said.
Unit sales of car and commercial vehicle tyres increased 2 per cent and 3
per cent respectively, while group turnover fell 3.3 per cent to DM9.4bn.
Last year's profits fall was less dramatic than expected, while sales and
earnings had increased in the first two months of the current year, he said.
Continental would respond to the continuing downward pressure on prices by
improving quality and reducing fixed costs rather than cutting output. A
further 2,000 jobs would be cut this year, following a reduction of 4,900 in
1993.
Mr von Grunberg forecast a positive result this year but refused to comment
on dividend prospects. Continental last paid a dividend in 1990.

FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Strong advance at CS Holding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CS Holding, the financial services and industrial group built around the
Credit Suisse bank, has reported a 69 per cent jump in net profit to
SFr1.99bn (Dollars 1.4m) for 1993, due mainly to outstanding earnings
generated by commission and trading business.
The group's preliminary statement revealed assets 39 per cent higher at
SFr346.5bn during 1993, largely because of the acquisition of Swiss
Volksbank, Switzerland's fourth largest bank. Group equity jumped 47 per
cent to SFr15.8bn at the year end.
The figures confirm CS as the largest Swiss financial group, surpassing
Union Bank of Switzerland with assets of SFr311.3bn at the year end. Swiss
Bank Corporation, the third largest, had assets of SFr207bn. UBS is the most
profitable of the three, with net income last year of SFr2.27bn, and is the
group with the largest equity base, SFr21.7bn.
Volksbank, which was on the verge of collapse before being taken over, did
not contribute to CS group profits last year.
CS said its operating profit from trading in foreign exchange, precious
metals and securities more than doubled to SFr5.2bn from SFr2.3bn while net
commission income advanced 40 per cent to SFr4.5bn. Net interest income grew
19 per cent to SFr3.2bn because of the inclusion of Volksbank activities.
Group cash flow expanded 78 per cent to SFr5.26bn, but provisions for bad
loans and depreciation soared 84 per cent to SFr3.26bn. Return on equity was
14.3 per cent or 13.2 per cent after deduction of minority interests.
The directors will make a dividend recommendation following the closing of
the CS financial year at the end of March.

FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: McDonnell Information joins
market worth Pounds 260m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
McDonnell Information Systems is coming to the market through a placing and
public offering at 260p a share, valuing the Hemel Hempstead-based computing
services company at Pounds 260m.
Some 73.1 shares are being issued, of which 42.5m are new shares with the
balance being sold by existing shareholders. Some 35 per cent of the offer,
which closes on March 17, is available to the public. Dealings commence on
March 24.
The flotation will raise Pounds 110m of new equity and Pounds 80m for
existing shareholders. The net proceeds, Pounds 107.4m, will be used to
repay debt and redeem preference shares.
MDIS management bought the company from McDonnell Douglas of the US for
Pounds 121m last year. Mr Jeremy Causley, chief executive, said he would not
be selling his shares. After the flotation management will hold 7.6 per cent
of the equity.
On a post-flotation pro forma basis, the company had pre-tax profits of
Pounds 21.3m in the year to December 1993. Out of earnings per share, it
would have paid a notional net dividend of 6.25p a share.
The placing and offer, one of the largest flotations this year and the
biggest in the information technology field, has been fully underwritten by
Baring Brothers, which is to sponsor the issue.
COMMENT
MDIS is a mature company with revenues of almost Pounds 150m and a record of
management competence. Operating profits as a percentage of turnover have
risen from 10 per cent to 15 per cent in the past three years in spite of
the recession. The company specialises in areas such as central and local
government, the emergency services and the health sector, which will show
sound, if not outstanding, growth. As a public company, it could reasonably
hope for more success in bidding for larger contracts. The offer price
suggests a p/e of 18.2 that is fractionally higher than the sectoral
average. Notional gross dividend yield at the offer price is 3 per cent. The
shares seem fairly priced and should prove a core holding for computing
services aficionados.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Diversification helps Polypipe advance 16%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Polypipe, the Doncaster-based manufacturer of industrial and commercial
plastic pipes and fittings and other domestic plastic products, yesterday
reported a 16 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 6.4m
to Pounds 7.45m.
The profit improvement came on turnover which grew by 23.6 per cent to
Pounds 60.8m (Pounds 49.2m) in the six months to December 31 including a
full 6-month contribution from Allerton Glass which was acquired last May
and merged with GCA Windows.
Earnings per share advanced by 15 per cent to 3.2p (2.78p) and the interim
dividend is being raised by 7.6 per cent to 0.71p (0.66p).
Polypipe's shares closed 2p higher at 175p.
Mr Kevin McDonald, chairman, said the results reflected 'the continuing
strength of both the group and its operations and the continuation of our
strategy of expanding wherever possible each of our businesses, investing in
plant and tooling and extensive product development.'
The latest figures also highlight the success of the group's diversification
since 1990 into non-core products by broadening its operating base while
remaining in the fields of plastics extrusion and moulding.
Sales of the group's other domestic plastic products, which now include
bathroom fixtures, windows and garden furniture, advanced by 35 per cent to
Pounds 28.2m (Pounds 20.9m) while operating profits from these activities
grew by more than 50 per cent, from Pounds 1.26m to Pounds 1.91m.
Overall operating profits increased by 14 per cent to Pounds 7.48m (Pounds
6.54m) despite relatively large increases in the purchase price of PVC which
affect Polypipe's sales of above and below ground drainage systems.
PVC prices have increased by 17 per cent since January last year. Since then
Polypipe has increased its product prices twice. Mr Bryan Stock, finance
director, said the higher PVC prices trimmed pipe margins in the first half
by between 1.7 and 1.8 percentage points but added that margins should be
mostly restored in the second half.
Net interest costs fell to Pounds 29,000 (Pounds 132,000) and the group
again ended the period with net cash and nil gearing. Capital expenditure in
the first half totalled Pounds 7.69m (Pounds 4.96m.)

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Linread 23% up despite exceptional
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Linread, the Midlands-based fasteners and precision components group,
brought forward the announcement of its annual results to announce a 23 per
cent rise in pre-tax profits and an increased dividend.
This follows a warning last December that exceptional charges in the second
half would be double those of the first, indicating a total for the year of
about Pounds 800,000 to pay for restructuring.
However, by bringing forward restructuring plans for this year the
exceptional charge was higher at Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 743,000). But this
still left pre-tax profits for the 12 months to December 31 at Pounds
857,000, against Pounds 697,000 restated for FRS 3 and to reflect changes in
the accounting policy for a leasehold property.
Earnings per share were 3.88p against a restated 2.21p. The proposed final
dividend is lifted to 2.35p (2.25p) making a total of 3.92p (3.75p).
Turnover was lower at Pounds 36.4m (Pounds 37.8m) while operating profits
fell from Pounds 1.49m to Pounds 1.08m. The pre-tax advance reflected a
sharp reduction in interest payable to Pounds 225,000 (Pounds 794,000).
This fall came because of tighter stock controls related to the greater
efficiency of the group's manufacturing techniques. Gearing was cut from
50.1 per cent to 28.4 per cent.
The tax charge, at Pounds 384,000 (Pounds 428,000), was again 'abnormally
high'.
The group has now finished its immediate restructuring programme and expects
to benefit quickly from any upturn in its main automotive and aerospace
markets. 'In certain sectors we anticipate increasing our market share,
particularly in North America,' Mr Peter Tahany, the chairman, said.
The shares rose 18p to 134p.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Expamet just in the black with Pounds
17,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Expamet International, the building, industrial and security components
group, yesterday announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 17,000 for 1993,
compared with a 1992 loss of Pounds 20.6m, restated for FRS 3.
The company has completed an aggressive restructuring programme, and the
1993 figures included a Pounds 2.1m write-off for redundancy costs, and
Pounds 1.5m losses from the sale or closure of businesses.
Expamet said the redundancy programme would achieve overall cost savings of
Pounds 3m in 1994.
Despite the impact of provisions on shareholders' funds, gearing fell from
125 per cent to 89 per cent, with borrowings cut from Pounds 17.6m to Pounds
11.2m.
The share price reacted favourably to the announcement, rising 8p to 77p.
Turnover fell to Pounds 126.9m, compared with Pounds 139m, but there was a
marginal increase in sales from continuing businesses in all three of its
main sectors.
The building and industrial businesses suffered from the performance of
subsidiaries in continental Europe, because of the effects of deepening
recession last year. Both sectors showed marginal declines in operating
profit.
The security sector, however, achieved a 47 per cent increase in profit to
Pounds 2.5m, helped by increasing export sales and a stronger domestic
market.
Mr John Roberts, chairman, said the first two months of 1994 had been
encouraging. He added that the cost base of the group has been cut so that
all the operating businesses can be profitable, 'irrespective of market
conditions', he said.
The company announced a final dividend of 1.25p, making a total of 2.5p,
down from 3.25p.
The company said it planned to return to consistently higher levels of
dividends.
Losses per share were much lower at 0.75p (32.48p).

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Battle for Barrhead in unusual twist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle for Barrhead Sanitary Ware, the Scottish workers co-operative,
took an unusual turn when one class of shareholder failed to achieve the
necessary threshold to approve one of the offers for the bathroom products
group.
It is thought there may be a danger that the other offer may also fail to
meet the threshold set down in Barrhead's articles, leaving the company in
danger of going into receivership.
An extraordinary general meeting was called to consider the offer from Baxi
Partnership, an employee-owned heating engineering company based in Preston,
Lanca- shire.
The meetings of the ordinary voting and preference shareholders agreed
unanimously to let the Baxi offer proceed but the ordinary non-voting
received the support of only 61 per cent against a threshold of 75 per cent.
The votes came despite the Barrhead board switching their support from Baxi
to Shires, a Bradford-based bathroom products group. The board now fears
this offer may not proceed under the present articles.
If both offers fail Baxi has offered to make a secured loan of Pounds
450,000 available to keep the company going and has proposals for
strengthening the Barrhead board. In the event of reaching agreement on the
Baxi proposals the Barrhead board intends simplifying its constitution.
Barrhead was formed in April 1992 by former workers of Armitage Shanks
following the closure of its works at Barrhead near Paisley.

classification
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The FT-SE Actuaries Industry Classification Committee has again turned down
a plea by Inchcape to move its shares from the vehicle distributors sector
to diversified industries, writes Maggie Urry.
The committee met on Monday, March 7, to discuss quarterly changes to the
constituents of sectors which will take effect on April 1. The new system
came into operation at the start of this year.
Inchcape said the committee's decision was 'a great disappointment'. It has
repeatedly argued that although 60 per cent of its 1992 profits derived from
'motors importing, distribution and retailing', only 14 per cent came from
the retail side.
Inchcape said it made a further submission to the committee arguing that
factors which affect UK motor retailers were different to those which bear
on Inchcape's activities.
The group is planning to alter the split of profits disclosed when it
publishes 1993 results on March 28. It will divide the motor retail profits
from the importing and distribution activity.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Valves division disposal boosts Suter to
Pounds 38.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp fall in interest payments helped Suter, the industrial conglomerate,
to increase 1993 profitability in spite of continuing tough trading
conditions in its main markets.
Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 15.2m, adjusted for FRS 3, to Pounds
38.2m, which included a Pounds 19.1m gain on the disposal of the group's
industrial valves division for Pounds 36m last April. In 1992 there was a
Pounds 1.1m exceptional charge relating to a provision against the value of
an associate undertaking.
Stripping out exceptional items left pre-tax profits up by 17 per cent to
Pounds 19.1m.
The disposal cut gearing from 70 per cent to 11 per cent and interest
payments fell from Pounds 4.1m to Pounds 1.4m. In January, the group
completed a sale and leaseback of an industrial estate in Staffordshire and
eliminating borrowings.
Group sales fell to Pounds 186.9m (Pounds 196m) including Pounds 6.9m
(Pounds 23.5m) from discontinued activities. Continuing businesses grew by 4
per cent to Pounds 180m, while trading profits, excluding the industrial
valves division, rose by 20 per cent from Pounds 16.3m to Pounds 19.5m.
In spite of competitive pressures on margins, the return on sales, excluding
discontinued businesses, rose from 9.4 to 10.8 per cent.
Mr David Abell, chairman, said: 'I expect to see a continuation of the
overall gradual but uneven improvement we have experienced in 1993.'
He added that no decision had been made regarding James Wilkes, the
Sheffield engineer in which Suter recently raised its stake to 29.5 per
cent. However, the chairman could not resist saying that the two groups
offered 'a fit as near perfect as you would get'.
Suter announced a further bonus issue of warrants of one for every 10
ordinary shares held. Mr Abell said terms would be structured so as not to
conflict with last year's warrant issue.
Earnings per share grew to 22.7p (8.7p) or 21p (8.6p) fully diluted.
Stripping out the exceptional, earnings rose by 18 per cent to 11.5p (9.7p)
or 11.3p (9.6p) fully diluted.
A recommended final dividend of 5.8p gives a total of 9.2p (8.8p), a rise of
4.5 per cent.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Thorntons surges 36% to Pounds 9.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thorntons, the chocolate maker and retailer that has reorganised its
lossmaking French businesses, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 9.58m for
the 28 weeks ended January 8.
'This is well above anything else we have reported before', said Mr John
Thornton, chairman and chief executive, yesterday.
The 36 per cent rise from a previous Pounds 7.02m reflected the benefits
from last year's French reorganisation, which helped push the group Pounds
4.8m into the red at the year-end.
Mr Thornton said the rationalisation was almost complete. The French
business would be concentrated on 20 shops in Paris, with 20 outlets being
closed.
At the operating level the loss from French operations was cut to Pounds
93,000 for the half, compared with Pounds 846,000 last time. 'We are very
confident about the future', said Mr Thornton.
Total group turnover from continuing operations rose by almost 10 per cent
from Pounds 51.4m to Pounds 56.4m, not including Pounds 2.27m (Pounds 2.95m)
from discontinued operations.
In the UK sales were boosted by a strong Christmas period, which accounts
for 30 per cent of annual turnover. Like-for-like sales in Thorntons own
shops were 4.1 per cent ahead.
Total UK sales, which include turnover from franchise outlets, chilled
cabinets and 'own label' sales to multiples, rose by 10.5 per cent to Pounds
54.2m.
The group opened 46 new outlets in the period, comprising 10 Thorntons
shops, one franchise and 35 chilled cabinets sited in other shops.
Mr Thornton said the group had made general gains in the efficiency of its
distribution system, cutting waste. Overall capital expenditure was Pounds
5m, down from Pounds 8.5m.
Earnings per share rose from 7.38p to 9.82p. The interim dividend has been
raised to 1.45p (1.25p).

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Trust launched to seek undervalued assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Value Management is launching an investment trust which aims to
seek out undervalued UK commercial and industrial companies.
The Undervalued Assets Trust is expected to raise Pounds 40m-Pounds 50m
through a placing and offer for subscription.
Companies will be selected through value management techniques, analysing
accounting data to find shares which stand at a significant discount to
their real worth.
'The UK market is not an efficient one. Exaggerated market sentiment can
colour perceptions of a company, clouding judgment on shares where there is
value to be found,' said Mr Colin McClean, managing director of Scottish
Value Management, who set up the company in 1990 after managing funds for
Scottish Provident, FS Assurance and Templeton.
The company already manages two listed investment trusts, both of which
invest in other investment trusts. It also has an insurance fund, SVM
Superior Growth, with an investment remit similar to the new trust. Launched
in October 1991, it was among the top ten performing funds (out of more than
600) last year.
Undervalued Assets Trust is issuing only ordinary shares, breaking the
current investment trust trend for all trusts, except those with a split
capital structure, to attach warrants to their ordinary shares.
The placing is due to close on March 31, and the public offer will run from
April 6 to April 20.

Fully-diluted net asset value per ordinary share of Sumit, the development
and venture capital investment trust, stood at 154p at the December 31 year
end. That compared with 103p at the half year stage and 95p 12 months
earlier.
The announcement yesterday of a proposed placing by Partico at 200p per
share will increase Sumit's fully-diluted figure to 186p. At the placing
price the trust's interest in Partico, including its holding of redeemable
preference shares, will be valued at Pounds 6.5m - a gain of Pounds 3m over
its December 1993 valuation.
Sumit has indicated its intention to sell a third of its holding in
Partico's ordinary equity at the placing price which will realise Pounds
1.7m.
Available revenue for 1993 improved from Pounds 161,000 to Pounds 303,000,
for earnings of 4.2p (2.2p). A final dividend of 2.3p, compared with a 1.3p
forecast, makes a 3p (1.4p) total.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Brent Intl pay-out cut after fall to Pounds
7.14m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brent International, the troubled speciality chemicals group whose chief
executive resigned in August, is cutting its dividend after pre-tax profits
slumped from Pounds 11.5m to Pounds 7.14m in 1993.
Profits for the year to December 31 were struck after Pounds 289,000 of
compensation to former chief executive Mr Steve Cuthbert, who had a two and
a half year contract at a salary of Pounds 135,000.
Mr Keith Hutchings, the former finance director who has been acting chief
executive since his departure, said the scale of compensation reflected the
fact that Mr Cuthbert was over 50.
Exceptionals of Pounds 3.91m included Pounds 580,000 of costs relating to
acquisitions which were aborted early in the year when the scale of the
group's problems became clear.
Earnings per share dropped from 10p to just 3.2p. There was a reduced final
of 2.4p (5.8p) leaving a total of 4p (7.4p).
The profit figure includes gains of Pounds 6.76m on the disposal of
businesses.
Sales from continuing operations rose 5 per cent to Pounds 114m. Excluding
exceptionals, operating profits in the continuing businesses fell from
Pounds 9.3m to Pounds 6m.
The company said there had been some improvement in the UK and US but not in
continental Europe which accounts for 43 per cent of sales.
However, Lord Lane of Horsell, chairman, said, 'the lower cost base from
which we now operate should enable us to make further progress in 1994.'
Mr Hutchings was yesterday confirmed as chief executive, with Mr Bill
Jessup, former finance director of Beauford, the struggling engineering
group, replacing him as finance director. Lord Lane will retire next year
and be succeeded as chairman by Mr Alec Daly, who joined the board a year
ago.
The shares fell 15 1/2 p to 105p.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Resort Hotels reveals loss of Pounds 71m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Resort Hotels yesterday released its long-awaited accounts for the year to
April 1993, revealing pre-tax losses of Pounds 71m and a negative net worth
of Pounds 22.7m.
The company is no longer able to cover its interest payments, and a number
of restructuring proposals are under consideration to enable the group to
survive.
Mr Robert Feld, the head of the family that built up the group, yesterday
resigned from the board. The other directors are expected to stand down at
the time of any restructuring, to facilitate inevitable management changes.
Resort Hotels shares have been suspended since July 16, when the company
first announced concerns over 'a number of financing and reporting issues'.
The hotel group had expanded aggressively in the previous two years, and it
admitted to difficulties over property valuations, which led to the lengthy
delay in releasing its accounts.
The company yesterday announced the extent of its difficulties. It wrote
down its properties by Pounds 40.5m to Pounds 64.4m and took a further
Pounds 11.5m charge on an inter-company loan to the Country Resorts group,
prior to its acquisition in 1993.
A further Pounds 8.5m provision has been made against amounts due from
management contracts with other troubled hotel owners.
In spite of an improving hotel market, the management said it was still
unable to cover its finance charges. Hotel Resorts suffered pre-tax losses,
before exceptional items, of Pounds 9.4m in the year ended April 1993, after
Pounds 4.7m in interest payments against its Pounds 53m bank debt.
Mr David Tonkinson, chairman, said the company was looking at a number of
options, which would result in a partial debt for equity swap and possibly a
merger with another hotel group.
The group's financial position has been improved by the Pounds 7.3m sale of
four hotels in February 1994, and the company said it believed 'the group's
lenders will be sympathetic to the implementation of a restructuring'.
Resort Hotels is believed to be in discussions with two other hotel groups,
but it is possible that it may consider a further rights issue.
Mr Tonkinson said: 'The main reason for our problems was the turbulence in
hotel property values and therefore the hardening of the attitudes of the
lenders.'
Resort Hotels was listed in March 1988, with a value of Pounds 6.7m. It
expanded rapidly through a string of rights issues and had a market
capitalisation of Pounds 46m at the time of its suspension.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Higher death rate helps Plantsbrook advance
33%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A significant rise in the fourth-quarter death rate helped to boost 1993
pre-tax profits by almost 33 per cent at Plantsbrook Group, the funeral
services group.
They rose from Pounds 9.05m to a record Pounds 12m. Total turnover rose from
Pounds 49.8m to Pounds 52m, including a contribution of Pounds 800,000 from
acquisitions.
Mr Peter Hindley, chief executive, said the overall rise of 4 per cent in
the death rate for 1993 was to some extent owing to flu towards the end of
the year. He expected the rate to fall back this year.
The result was also helped by a reduction in net interest payable from
Pounds 1.96m to Pounds 586,000. This reflected lower rates; the repayment of
Pounds 3.3m of fixed rate hire purchase debt; a reduction in total
borrowings from Pounds 11.2m to Pounds 7m; and the benefit of a Pounds 2m
private placing of 2.99m ordinary shares last June.
Earnings per share on a fully diluted basis rose from 7.03p to 7.77p. In
addition to the June placing, 25.9m shares were issued in October and
November following the conversion of the unlisted 1997 preference shares.
There are now 106.5m ordinary shares in issue.
The group made five acquisitions in the year, paying Pounds 2.4m, and has
opened seven new branches. So far this year it has acquired two more
businesses for Pounds 4.2m cash.
Further acquisitions were likely, said Mr Hindley. The group was also
looking at ways of returning to the crematorium market.
Dignity, the pre-paid funeral business had performed satisfactorily, said Mr
Hindley, generating Pounds 1.5m of turnover. An autumn advertising campaign
had resulted in a 42 per cent increase in sales in the second half.
Gearing at the end of the year was 28 per cent, compared with 54 per cent in
1992.
A final dividend of 2.3p (2p) is proposed, giving a total of 3.4p for the
year (3p).
COMMENT
While the unexpected rise in last year's mortality rate provided a boost to
profits, the achievements of the present management in restoring Plantsbrook
to a strongly cash generative business should not be overlooked. However,
profits this year are likely to remain static unless the death rate rises
again. The group's 9 per cent market share of funerals looks mature. It is
way behind market leader Great Southern in the pre-paid funeral business.
Tough new environmental legislation on crematoriums could lead to local
authority privatisation or operating contracts, but it would be expensive to
build new ones. At yesterday's close of 109p and a prospective p/e of 13.5p
the shares look a hold - but keep an eye on the deaths column.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Holders confirm QMH Pounds 2bn limit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders of Queens Moat Houses, the hotel group in talks with its banks
over refinancing its Pounds 1.3bn of debt, yesterday confirmed the group's
borrowing limit of Pounds 2bn at two special meetings.
Some shareholders used the meeting to ask questions about indemnity
insurance for the company's directors.
Mr Stanley Metcalfe, chairman, refused to answer these questions saying they
were outside the scope of the meeting, but said it was normal for large
public companies to take out insurance covering directors against liability.
Mr John Bairstow, the group's former chairman, said later that when he was
in charge at QMH the group's indemnity cover of Pounds 10m cost Pounds
34,000 a year.
The premium is now reputed to be Pounds 700,000. This would reflect the
substantial change in the group's position with massive losses, the shares
suspended, a department of trade and industry investigation proceeding and
threats of litigation.
Mr Bairstow changed his vote at the meeting. In advance of the meeting he
had voted his 8m shares against the resolution by proxy but in the poll
taken at the meeting he voted in favour.
At the meetings Mr Metcalfe said the group's results for 1993, which will
incorporate a new property valuation, should be completed by the end of
April.
He said the restructuring talks were progressing, and the foundations for a
reconstruction were being laid.
He said he was sorry it was taking so long but there were a number of
complex issues involved.
He hoped that the shares, which were suspended in March last year, would be
relisted as soon as shareholders approved the restructuring.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Wates City disappoints with Pounds 0.1m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wates City of London Properties, the development and investment group,
disappointed the stock market yesterday despite increasing optimism on City
office prices.
Even though the company announced a return to the black in the year ended
December 31, with pre-tax profits of Pounds 113,000 against a loss of Pounds
74.9m (after write-downs of Pounds 71.9m on property valuations last time),
the share price still fell 8 1/2 p to 87 1/2 p.
Disappointment focused on a further property provision of Pounds 2.7m in
1993, and on Wates' net asset value per share of 72.8p, an increase of only
0.4p.
However, Wates has substantially strengthened its balance sheet through a
rights issue and property disposals. Total borrowings fell by 38 per cent to
Pounds 56.2m.
There were reduced losses per share last year of 0.71p (59.26p).

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Reorganisation costs hit MR-Data profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR-Data Management, the data transcription and document image processing
group, reported lower interim pre-tax profits reflecting one-off
reorganisation costs, lower net interest income and development costs in its
Memex software division.
In the six months to December 31 profits fell by 34 per cent to Pounds 2.66m
(Pounds 4.02m) on turnover up 5 per cent to Pounds 19.6m (Pounds 18.6m).
Earnings per share declined to 3.21p (4.89p). However, the interim dividend
is being raised by 20 per cent to 2.076p (1.73p) reflecting the group's
strong balance sheet and cash position.
Mr John Redmond, chairman, said: 'During the past months we have reorganised
our business resulting in significant one-off costs which have been absorbed
in the first half. Additionally profits have been affected by the on-going
development costs at Memex.'
Operating profits slipped to Pounds 2.83m (Pounds 3.02m). The 1992 figure
was boosted, following accounting rule changes, by the writing back of
Pounds 651,000 of acquisition provisions. The 1993 figure was reduced by
reorganisation costs of Pounds 382,000.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Wates City disappoints with Pounds 0.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wates City of London Properties, the development and investment group,
disappointed the stock market yesterday despite increasing optimism on City
office prices.
Even though the company announced a return to the black in the year ended
December 31, with pre-tax profits of Pounds 113,000 against a loss of Pounds
74.9m (after write-downs of Pounds 71.9m on property valuations last time)
the share price still fell 8 1/2 p to 87 1/2 p.
Disappointment focused on a further property provision of Pounds 2.7m in
1993, and on Wates' net asset value per share of 72.8p, an increase of only
0.4p.
However, 1993 was a turnround year for Wates, which entered the recession
with 27 per cent gearing but saw it peak at 102 per cent due to slashed
property valuations.
Last year, Wates substantially strengthened its balance sheet, through a
rights issue and property disposals.
Total borrowings fell by 38 per cent to Pounds 56.2m, and gearing fell from
102 per cent to 50 per cent.
Wates is proceeding with the site formation for a 57,400 sq ft office and
retail development in Queen's Street, although it is possible that the site
could be sold.
It will also demolish Winchester House during 1994, to make way for a
300,000 sq ft office development. The project is 60 per cent owned by
Friends Provident.
Wates is unable to renew a dividend payment, because of a substantial
deficit on the company's profit and loss account.
There were reduced losses per share of 0.71p (59.26p).
Mr James Dundas Hamilton has announced his retirement as non-executive
chairman. He will be replaced by Mr Paul Wates, the current chief executive.

MR-Data Management, the data transcription and document image processing

reorganisation costs, lower net interest income and development costs in its
Memex software division.
In the six months to December 31 profits fell by 34 per cent to Pounds 2.66m
(Pounds 4.02m) on turnover up 5 per cent to Pounds 19.6m (Pounds 18.6m).
Earnings per share declined to 3.21p (4.89p). However, the interim dividend
is being raised by 20 per cent to 2.076p (1.73p) reflecting the group's

Mr John Redmond, chairman, said: 'During the past months we have reorganised
our business resulting in significant one-off costs which have been absorbed
in the first half. Additionally profits have been affected by the on-going
development costs at Memex.
'However, we are operating in high growth markets and, in particular,
prospects for our software products and our laser printing and document
scanning service bureau are extremely good. We therefore remain optimistic
about the remainder of the year.'
Operating profits slipped to Pounds 2.83m (Pounds 3.02m) mainly reflecting
the development costs at Memex. The 1992 figure was boosted, following
accounting rule changes, by the writing back of Pounds 651,000 of
acquisition provisions. The 1993 figure was reduced by reorganisation costs
of Pounds 382,000.
Mr Redmond said the redundancy and reorganisation costs in the document
image processing division would result in annual savings of Pounds 710,000
and were necessary to reposition the business for growth.
In the core data transcription division the COM and laser printing bureau
services both increased production volumes, turnover and profit. Margins in
both businesses also improved.
Net interest receipts fell to Pounds 212,000 (Pounds 365,000) although the
group ended the year with cash balances of Pounds 9.57m, up by Pounds 2.69m
from June 30, partly reflecting the crystalisation of a Pounds 1.05m
exchange gain.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Partco for market with Pounds 59m price tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Partco Group, the biggest independent distributor of automotive parts and
equipment in the UK, is raising about Pounds 20.7m through a placing and
intermediaries offer at 200p per share - valuing the whole company at Pounds
59.2m.
The placing and offer comprises 14.58m ordinary shares - 11m of which are
new ordinaries being issued by the company.
The remaining 3.58m shares are being sold by existing shareholders.
Partco, which was a management buy-out in 1986 from Quinton Hazell, trades
from more than 200 branches in the UK and had sales of about Pounds 124m in
1993.
Pre-tax profits last year were Pounds 4.28m, from which pro-forma earnings
on an actual tax basis were 13.2p a share. This gives an historic multiple
of 15.2 times at the 200p offer price.
The notional net dividend for 1993 was 5.35p, giving a gross yield of 3.3
per cent.
The group is being advised by Hambro Magan, with Cazenove acting as brokers
to the issue. The closing date for the intermediaries offer is March 15 and
dealings are expected to begin on March 18.
COMMENT
Improved distribution methods, long familiar in retailing and industry, are
transforming the previously fragmented business of supplying automotive
parts to garages. Last month Finelist, a smaller competitor to Partco, was
floated successfully. Now investors are offered an opportunity to back the
biggest group in the field, which has a national warehouse and sees scope
for rapid expansion. With forecast earnings of about 11.9p per share in the
current year, the shares are on a prospective multiple of 16.8, a discount
to Finelist, and a prospective yield of 3.5 per cent - a premium to the
smaller company. The pricing does not look aggressive and should leave the
larger group plenty to go for.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Claremont buys Magellan Inds - New group to
supply 11% of Marks and Spencer's clothing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Claremont Garments, the clothing manufacturer, yesterday announced an agreed
Pounds 43.3m takeover of Magellan Industries, the lingerie and swimwear
company.
The takeover, bringing together two of Marks and Spencer's leading
suppliers, follows production problems at Magellan, which yesterday reported
increased pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.26m in the 12 months to December 31,
compared with Pounds 511,000.
Mr Chris Ryder, Magellan chief executive, said the acquisition by Claremont
was an attractive option after a year in which it failed to recruit enough
workers or ensure adequate raw material supplies to complete orders for
Marks and Spencer.
Under the all-paper offer, Claremont is issuing up to 12.8m new shares, some
23.9 per cent of the enlarged group, which are being offered to Magellan
shareholders on a 0.4816-for-1 basis.
The offer has already been accepted by Magellan directors and family trusts
associated with Mr Oliver Prenn, the chairman, which together control 36.1
per cent of the company.
Schroder Investment Management, Magellan's largest institutional
shareholder, has also agreed to procure acceptances on behalf of investors
holding a further 14.8 per cent.
Welcoming the undertakings, Mr Peter Wiegand, Claremont chairman, said: 'The
acquisition will strengthen our product range and our relationship with
Marks and Spencer.'
He claimed the group would supply up to 11 per cent of the retailer's total
clothing stock, which in turn would account for 95 per cent of its business.
Marks and Spencer welcomed the takeover and said it was happy with the
terms.
Claremont, meanwhile, announced a 36 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 11.5m (Pounds 8.5m) in the 12 months to December 25.
The improvement was spurred by full year contributions from two earlier
acquisitions - J&amp;J Fashions and Alexander Milnes - which helped operating
profits increase by 32 per cent to Pounds 11.9m (Pounds 9m).
Turnover increased to Pounds 114.4m (Pounds 81.5m), while earnings per share
came out at 19.1p (16.4p) or 18.2p (16.2p) on a fully diluted basis.
By comparison, turnover at Magellan in 1993 was flat at Pounds 36.9m (Pounds
35.5m). Losses per share of were 4.7p (2p) or 2.7p (0.2p) excluding
exceptional items.
The group's results were hit not only by supply and staffing problems but
also by a Pounds 496,000 exceptional charge following the collapse last
August of Dunkeld, the shirt manufacturer. The charge arose out of losses on
Dunkeld shares which Magellan received in part payment for Slix, its
swimwear brand, sold in 1992 for Pounds 1.07m.
It plans an unchanged final dividend of 1.4p; while Claremont announced a
proposed final pay-out of 4.5p (3.95p), making 8.1p for the year (7.25p).
Claremont is also acquiring Bellrise Fashions, the Next supplier for Pounds
1.9m cash, funded from bank reserves of Pounds 6.6m.
Its shares rose 5p to 358p. Magellan's closed down 1p at 172p.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Gartmore higher than forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gartmore, the UK-based fund management company yesterday reported pre-tax
profits for 1993 of Pounds 24.6m, nearly Pounds 2m higher than forecast when
its shares were first offered to the public last November.
Banque Indosuez floated 25 per cent of its stake in Gartmore last November
in a sale that valued the company at about Pounds 338m.
Profits would have been Pounds 2.7m higher had it not been for non-recurring
items relating to the disposition of a loan and staff retention scheme set
in place when Banque Indosuez was the sole owner.
A year earlier it had a loss of Pounds 2.15m after Pounds 17.1m of
non-recurring charges relating mainly to a loan from Banque Indosuez.
Earnings were 8.7p a share against a loss of 1.8p. It plans to pay its first
post-flotation dividend at the half-year.
Gartmore's funds under management grew 64 per cent in 1993 to Pounds 21bn,
with net new money up Pounds 4.2bn. The remainder of the growth was
accounted for by market movements and investment returns.
Mr Paul Myners, executive chairman, said the rate of new business growth was
highly unusual for Gartmore or for the industry generally and is unlikely to
be repeated. 'We would discourage analysts and others from forecasting this
rate of growth,' he said.
Mr Myners said that to handle the influx of new cash, Gartmore had increased
its staff numbers by 36, mostly adding fund managers and client service
managers. Industry analysts have said that the greatest difficulty facing
Gartmore, now one of the so-called 'Big Four' UK pension fund managers, is
whether it can manage the rapid increase in funds under management without
damaging investment performance or client servicing capacity.
Mr David Watts, managing director of Gartmore's pension fund management
business, said that the growth in assets had made rapid execution of
portfolio shifts somewhat more difficult.
Gartmore has begun to ask its clients for permission to use derivatives to
gain access to markets quickly at lower execution costs.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Growth expected to continue at Hays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hays, the business service group, increased its pre-tax profits by 33 per
cent to Pounds 38.6m in the six months to December 31.
Mr Ronnie Frost, executive chairman, said the distribution and personnel
core activities both increased profits by a substantial margin while
commercial activity saw profits increase more modestly.
He said: 'The improvement in profit is expected to continue in the second
half, although the percentage increase will be lower due to the stronger
performance in the comparable period last year.'
Hays said the trading environment of its UK businesses had slowly improved
since January, 1993, whilst the German and French economies remained in
recession.
In distribution, operating profits increased by 34 per cent to Pounds 23.4m.
Mr Frost said the chemical distribution profits were adversely affected by
over Pounds 1m as a result of the weakness in the world price of caustic
soda, although sales volumes had been well maintained.
He said: 'There was a particularly strong performance from packaged
chemicals which continued to increase both market share and margins, winning
a new contract with Shell for the distribution of solvents.'
In personnel, operating profits bounced back from Pounds 2.1m to Pounds
6.4m. Temporary placements were particularly buoyant and the number of
permanent placements had also started to increase, but at a slower rate.
Operating profits from commercial activities rose from Pounds 10.6m to
Pounds 11.7m. Britdoc, the group's overnight parcels business, had expanded.
However, profits from records management fell as demand shifted from space
managed by clients towards Hays fast access storage.
Earnings per share increased by 31 per cent to 6.4p (4.9p). The interim
dividend was lifted by 15 per cent to 1.95p (1.7p).
COMMENT
A share price unchanged at 309p seemed scant reward for announcing this sort
of profits increase. But on a day that the FTSE 100 fell 41.5 points, just
holding on to recent gains was no mean achievement. The results were in line
with expectations, although analysts were disappointed that the share of
profits coming from the group's highly regarded commercial activities fell
back from 35 to 28 per cent. Forecast full-year profits of Pounds 85m put
the shares on a prospective multiple of 22, a 30 per cent premium to the
market. The shares have outperformed by 16 per cent over the past year, so
they certainly are not cheap at this level. However, Hays still has plenty
of recovery potential in both personnel and caustic soda distribution, even
if Mr Frost does not expect the chemical's price to firm much before the end
of 1994.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Enviromed purchase and joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Enviromed, the biotechnology group, yesterday announced a Pounds 9m
acquisition and joint venture plan aimed at expanding its distribution and
supply of research and healthcare products.
The company, which came to the market last year, said the expansion would be
dominated by the acquisition of Biozyme, the private laboratory group, for
Pounds 8.05m cash.
Mr Peter Townsend, chief executive, said Biozyme - which specialises in the
isolation and supply of enzymes for clinical laboratories and the
diagnostics industry - would complement its existing biochemical monitoring
business.
'It's a very exciting prospect for us - Biozyme's enzyme technology will
make an important contribution to our operations,' he added.
Enviromed has also agreed to form a European joint venture with Selfcare,
the US distributor of self-diagnosis and self-treatment products.
As part of the joint venture agreement, Enviromed is buying a 12.5 per cent
stake in the Massachussett's-based company for Dollars 1.5m (Pounds 1m).
The Biozyme acquisition and Selfcare share stake will be funded by a Pounds
9.8m placing and open offer of 8.63m new ordinary shares at 125p each.
Singer and Friedlander, which is handling the offer, said existing
shareholders would be offered new shares on a 3-for-5 basis.
Enviromed's directors, who currently hold 52.06 per cent of the shares, are
expected to retain 34 per cent once the placing and offer is completed.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Johnson Matthey chief executive to resign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Richard Wakeling is to quit as chief executive of Johnson Matthey, the
precious metals group, at the end of this month. He is expected to receive
compensation in the region of Pounds 330,000.
Mr Wakeling is not being replaced, but Mr David Davies, chairman, is to take
on the chief executive role as well. Mr Geoffrey Wilson, a non-executive
director, is becoming deputy chairman.
Mr Wakeling, 46, joined JM as a non-executive director in 1987, when he was
finance director of Charter Consolidated which held a 38.5 per cent stake in
JM. Charter sold its stake a year ago. He became deputy chief executive in
January 1990 and chief executive in January 1991. JM said it wished Mr
Wakeling well in his 'alternative career'.
JM said yesterday that Mr Wakeling's job had been to supervise the three
year reorganisation of the group and he had now completed his task. It had
been the consensus view of the board that his job was no longer necessary.
It said that operational management was strong and Mr Davies was a hands-on
executive chairman.
Further, the group had talked to its institutional shareholders about
combining the chairman and chief executive roles. The changes had been
approved by two non-executives representing the group's two largest
shareholders, Johannesburg Consolidated Investment and Minorco, which hold
20 per cent between them bought from Charter.
Mr Chris Clark, executive director in charge of materials technology,
becomes managing director, materials technology, colour and print. Mr Graham
Titcombe, executive director, precious metals and catalytic systems, becomes
managing director with the same responsibilities.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Southern Newspapers surges to Pounds 7m
midway
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Profits at Southern Newspapers, the regional newspaper group, surged from
Pounds 3m to Pounds 7.15m pre-tax for the 26 weeks ended January 1. The
figure included a Pounds 3.5m profit from the sale of the group's
shareholding in Portsmouth &amp; Sunderland Newspapers.
Turnover improved to Pounds 36.62m (Pounds 35.41m), generating operating
profits of Pounds 3.58m (Pounds 2.95m). The group had noted a 'slight
improvement' in trading conditions since July.
The main contributor to the improved trading performance was the newspaper
division, although the magazine contract printing division increased
turnover by a 'significant' amount.
Earnings emerged at 25.28p (8.88p) and the interim dividend is being lifted
to 3.5p (3p).
The directors said the acquisitions of the Stour Valley News, Monitor
Business Magazine and the seven titles of the west country-based Star
Newspaper Group had yet to make a real impact on the results.
They added that the benefit of rationalisation programmes in all cases
should be seen in the second half.
The half year pre-tax result virtually matched the Pounds 7.51m returned for
the previous full year.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Taunton and Molson in US cider deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Americans used to the traditional autumnal tipple of apple cider may find
something rather more exotic on offer this year with the announcement
yesterday that Taunton Cider has clinched a distribution deal with the
specialist drinks importer, Molson USA.
Taunton is aiming at the up market drinker, including the 'working woman who
wants to stay in control'. She will be able to enjoy products such as Fres,
which is what Taunton calls a low alcohol product at just 4 per cent. Other
ciders to be introduced are Diamond White and Red Rock.
Taunton said yesterday it planned to introduce six of its brands in four
states from May through Molson's distribution network. After an initial
trial period, one or two brands would be chosen for sale throughout the US.
The group is moving into the US as trading in the UK appears to have become
increasingly difficult. Taunton also announced that competition from the
supermarket economy brands continued to affect trading. A substantial
marketing programme had been launched which would result in a lower average
selling price for the second half.
As a result, Taunton said sales and operating profits were expected to be
largely in line with last year's Pounds 129.9m and Pounds 19.7m
respectively. However, Mr Nick Pearch, finance director, said there was
likely to be some benefit at the pre-tax level from lower interest rates.
The US deal was not expected to show a return for some time. All proceeds
from the first year's shipment would be reinvested in marketing.
Mr Pearch said the US potential was enormous, with the beer market some five
times bigger than in the UK.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Gibbs and Dandy back in the black with
Pounds 850,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Reductions in costs and interest charges and a halving of bad debts helped
Gibbs and Dandy, builders merchants, turn in a profit for 1993 after three
years of losses.
The company made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 852,000 for the year to December
31 against a loss of Pounds 124,000, helped by a cut in interest charges
from Pounds 377,000 to Pounds 136,000 and the reduction of bad debts to
Pounds 208,000.
Turnover for the year was 4.2 per cent ahead at Pounds 23.5m (Pounds 22.6m).
Earnings per share were 7.4p, against losses of 1.4p.
The return to profitability by the end of the first half gave the company
the confidence to pay its first dividend for more than three years, an
interim of 1p, and to anticipate a second interim of at least 1p.
This is now to be paid at 1.5p, with the payment as a second interim instead
of a final making earlier payment possible and giving a 2.5p total for the
year.

</HEADLINE>

Burnfield incurred a loss in the second half and for the whole of 1993
suffered a profits fall from Pounds 2.68m to Pounds 776,000 pre-tax.
The total dividend year is being cut to 2.5p (5.75p) via a reduced final of
0.85p. Earnings per share were 1.4p (6.5p).
The second half deficit of Pounds 493,000 compared with previous profits of
Pounds 1.57m.
The directors said, however, that 1994 had started well and that actions
taken would bring an early return to earnings and dividend growth. The
shares rose 5p to 77p.
Turnover rose from Pounds 29.82m to Pounds 38.53m. The West Midlands-based
group manufactures industrial controls and measurement equipment.
Restructuring costs of Pounds 1m at the Isopad and Budenberg offshoots were
charged against profits as were aborted acquisition costs and head office
restructuring expenses of Pounds 486,000.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Accountants investigate Cupid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cupid, the beleaguered bridal wear manufacturer, is believed to have
commissioned a firm of accountants to investigate events leading to this
week's warning of substantial losses, writes Peggy Hollinger.
The group is also expected to announce the departure of Mr Richard Shaw,
chief executive, who earlier this week was suspended temporarily from his
duties.
Staff at Cupid's Lancashire offices said yesterday he had already left the
company.
It is believed that Mr Shaw, who was on a 12-month rolling contract, will
receive compensation of less than Pounds 100,000. He was brought into the
group at the request of shareholders following a profits warning in February
1993. His brief was to lead Cupid through a series of acquisitions. However,
this programme was never begun.
In January, the company announced interim losses of Pounds 456,000 and said
it was not clear whether it would return to profitability for the year. On
Monday, however, it became clear that the losses would be substantial after
provisions needed to restructure the bridal business.
Cupid is not expected to replace Mr Shaw. It is understood that his
responsibilities will be shared by Mr Stephen Riley, the finance director,
and Mr Robert Devlin, managing director of the Pronuptia/Youngs business.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Evode enhances Laporte's earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Laporte, the speciality chemicals group, ended a three-year decline in
earnings per share in 1993 helped by last February's acquisition of Evode,
the adhesives and plastics manufacturer.
At the time the City had been sceptical of Laporte's insistence that Evode
would enhance earnings. But Mr Ken Minton, chief executive, said that all
Evode's businesses had performed extremely well and that the acquisition had
more than met the commitment made to shareholders.
Evode, which cost Pounds 228m including debt, made an 11-month contribution
with operating profits of Pounds 27.6m on sales of Pounds 250m. That helped
group pre-tax profit advance 24 per cent to Pounds 107m (Pounds 86.6m).
Group turnover jumped 47 per cent to Pounds 893m (Pounds 608m) including
associates of Pounds 16m (Pounds 86m). Earnings per share rose 6 per cent to
41.4p (39.2p). The dividend is also increased by 6 per cent with a proposed
final of 13.3p taking the total to 20.7p (19.5p).
Mr Minton said that excluding acquisitions and favourable exchange rate
movements pre-tax profits would have been 'just slightly ahead'.
The level of provisions against Evode, which surprised analysts when first
announced at the interim stage, has edged up Pounds 1m to Pounds 25.9m.
Mr Minton said Evode's margins had more than doubled to 11 per cent and that
there had been no benefit from written down stocks.
Profits were struck after sharply higher depreciation of Pounds 27.2m
(Pounds 17.8m) following several years of heavy capital investment. Capital
expenditure fell from Pounds 74.1m to Pounds 48.8m and there was a cash
inflow from operations of Pounds 21.8m, compared with an outflow of Pounds
81.2m in 1992.
After peaking at Pounds 190m immediately after the Evode acquisition
borrowings ended the year at Pounds 135m (Pounds 126m) for gearing of 44 per
cent. Mr Minton said there would be further disposals this year with the
proceeds 'redeployed in capital expenditure and add-on acquisitions'.
The shares fell 20p to 794p.
COMMENT
The City seems to have regained its faith in Laporte after two years of
doubt. Although earnings per share in 1993 were more than a tenth lower than
the 46.7p recorded in 1989 supporters point to Laporte's achievements over
the period, not least the exit from the Interox joint venture which left it
a pure speciality chemicals company. The Evode deal shows once again it can
make the acquisition numbers add up and the company can still blame market
conditions for the lack of underlying growth. But that will have to change
soon if its regained premium rating is to be sustained. Assuming profits of
Pounds 120m this year, for earnings of about 45p, the multiple is now almost
18.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Ingredient for success pays off as Kerry
achieves IPounds 35m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Strong growth in its food ingredients division, supported by a strong
dollar, helped Kerry Group, the Irish food manufacturer, lift pre-tax
profits by 22 per cent to IPounds 35m (Pounds 34m) for the year ended
December 31.
Turnover grew from IPounds 827m to IPounds 880m. Food ingredients now
comprise 40 per cent of turnover, having grown by a fifth in 1993. The meat
division contracted slightly while the dairy activities grew only modestly.
No divisional breakdown of profits was given but the company said margins
had improved across the group.
The tax charge rose from 11.4 per cent to 17 per cent, reflecting the
group's broader geographic spread - especially into the North American
market.
Kerry now has six food ingredient plants in the US, two in Canada and,
following an acquisition in December, one in Mexico. The latter is expected
to boost group turnover by a further IPounds 70m within the next two to
three years.
Further acquisitions in this sector are being considered in both North and
South America as well as in Europe.
Capital expenditure more than doubled during the year to IPounds 41.7m,
while a further IPounds 17m was spent on acquisitions.
Borrowings increased by IPounds 38m to IPounds 142m, giving a gearing of 56
per cent.
Interest charges were cut to IPounds 10.99m (IPounds 13.89m) largely as a
result of the group's placing of Dollars 155m (Pounds 106m) in loan notes
with US investors last September at what were described as 'historically low
interest rates'.
Earnings per share advanced to 18.5p (15.8p) and a final dividend of 1.69p
makes a 2.6p (2.26p) total.
COMMENT
The strategic expansion of Kerry's food ingredients division in the US,
Canada and Mexico has been clearly justified given the increasingly
significant contribution of these investments to the bottom line, even if
the company is paying top prices for its acquisitions. What is not so clear
is whether the group's earlier diversification into the
intensely-competitive and low margin red meat processing business was as
well considered or planned - although it has successfully built up a strong
customer base through multiple retail outlets in the UK and Europe and seems
prepared to operate at tighter margins than some of its main competitors.
Continued growth will come through the food ingredients and convenience
meats divisions and pre-tax profits of IPounds 39m seem likely for 1994,
giving earnings of 20p and a prospective p/e of 16.8. As the blue chip of
Irish food stocks this looks sustainable, but don't expect it to outshine
the market as much as it has in the past.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Barings leaps to Pounds 100m helped by
securities side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barings, the closely held UK-based investment bank, reported pre-tax profits
of Pounds 100m for 1993, a dramatic improvement over 1992 when they halved
to Pounds 21.3m from the year before.
The group, whose share capital is owned by a charity established by the
Barings family, did not provide details of which activities had contributed
most to profits. But Mr Andrew Tuckey, Barings deputy chairman, said that
Baring Securities, which had experienced significant losses on Japanese
equities in 1992, had recovered strongly in 1993.
He also said that the Group had benefited from the enormous surge in
interest in investing in emerging markets. Among Baring's core businesses is
its role as an agency stockbroker and trader of emerging markets securities
with offices in 23 countries.
However, emerging markets have fallen somewhat since the start of the
current year and Mr Peter Baring, chairman, warned that the improvement in
the group's profitability was unlikely to continue at the same pace in 1994.
'During 1993, a number of factors working in our favour helped us produce
significantly improved profitability. While it is unlikely they will persist
during 1994, the year has started well and I believe we will face no
shortage of opportunity,' he said.
Barings said that its income from trading activity grew sharply from Pounds
65.3m to Pounds 149m while fees and commissions rose from Pounds 272m to
Pounds 377m.
Operating expenses also rose sharply to Pounds 469m aginst Pounds 349m. Mr
Tuckey said that worldwide, Barings has increased its staff by about 10 per
cent but the need to increase bonuses had also contributed to the sharp rise
in costs.
Mr Baring said: 'It is imperative for us to remunerate competitively if we
are to attract and retain good people; this is especially the case for a
group like Barings which is operating internationally, often in direct
competition with US-owned houses.'
A reorganisation which integrated the Baring Securities and Baring Brothers
and Co arms of the business into a new investment banking group is paying
off, Mr Tuckey said. The costs of that reorganisation, due to be completed
this year, were absorbed in the 1993 accounts.
Also contributing to profits were the activities of US investment bank
Dillon Read in which Barings has a 40 per cent stake. Mr Tuckey said the
bank, which specialises in US corporate finance and municipal bond
underwriting and trading, had had its most profitable year ever in 1993.

FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: ADT net income little changed at Dollars
111.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADT, the electronic security services and car auction group which does much
of its business in the US but retains a UK quote, yesterday reported net
income of Dollars 111.7m (Pounds 76.5m) for 1993.
The result was little changed from the Dollars 109.1m recorded in 1992, the
first year that the Bermuda-registered group reported under US GAAP rules.
Earnings per share were unchanged at 80 cents despite a higher Dollars 21.2m
(Dollars 6.8m) tax charge and the issue of 20.7m new shares as part of the
Dollars 1.25bn refinancing package completed in August.
Operating income after goodwill amortisation of Dollars 26.5m (Dollars
27.9m) increased by 8.5 per cent to Dollars 197.4m (Dollars 181.9m) on net
sales of Dollars 1.38bn (Dollars 1.35bn) led by the electronic security
services business which lifted its profit contribution to Dollars 154m
(Dollars 141m) on sales of Dollars 937.3m (Dollars 901.1m).
Commenting on the results, Mr Michael Ashcroft, chairman and chief
executive, said they were 'on target with the electronic security services
division successfully adding 145,000 new residential customers during the
year and the vehicle auction division having continued success in
encouraging new and used vehicle dealers to attend the company's auctions on
a regular basis.'
Net interest costs increased to Dollars 47.3m (Dollars 42.7m) mainly
reflecting a decline in interest income.
Mr Ashcroft said the refinancing, which lengthened ADT's average debt
maturities to over seven years, provided 'a firm base for the continued
development of the businesses.'
COMMENT
ADT's two core businesses continue to perform solidly if not spectacularly
with net cash flow from operations increasing to Dollars 271.4m (Dollars
221.9m) last year. ADT's residential security operations continue to benefit
from growing concern about crime on both sides of the Atlantic while the car
auctions business should benefit from the revitalised new car market. The
group has been investing heavily to cut costs and the few remaining non-core
operations are slated for sale. Offsetting these positives are the higher
interest costs associated with the debt refinancing and the continued
increase in ADT's reported tax rate, which will leave earnings virtually
unchanged this year. ADT's shares continue to underperform the market,
reflecting investors' concerns about the group's chequered history.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Jardine may have to delist from HK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON and LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The attempt by the Jardine group of companies to bypass Hong Kong's takeover
laws and remain listed on the colony's stock exchange appeared untenable
yesterday, with regulators apparently unprepared to revoke their opposition
to the company's plans.
It is understood that the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the
colony's corporate watchdog, will not approve the company's proposed scheme
whereby Bermudan takeover law especially enacted for Jardine supersedes Hong
Kong rules.
This scheme has been the subject of negotiation between Jardine and the SFC
since the beginning of this year. A failure of the two to agree raises the
possibility that the Jardine group might delist its shares in Hong Kong.
Jardine precipitated a flight of capital from Hong Kong in 1984 when it
announced it would move its company registration to Bermuda. The company
does not believe that Hong Kong's legal framework will provide sufficient
protection after China resumes sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997.
The Chinese government has frequently attacked Jardine because of its stated
support for Governor Chris Patten's democracy plans, and its alleged
involvement in the removal of Mr Patten's predecessor.
Last May, Jardine said Bermuda had agreed to enact laws to bring the Jardine
group under a statutory version of London's Takeover Code. The code will be
administered by Bermuda's Monetary Authority.
However the SFC is concerned about the credibility of such legislation,
created at the behest of one company. It claims the takeover code in Bermuda
applies to one company in Bermuda - Jardine - and it believes that companies
operating in Hong Kong should abide by Hong Kong rules.
The Jardine group comprises Jardine Matheson, Jardine Strategic, Mandarin
Oriental, Hongkong Land, and Dairy Farm. Their combined market
capitalisation accounts for about 9.7 per cent of the Hong Kong stock
market.
Mr Nigel Rich, the company's managing director, steps down this month to
return to the UK. His place will be taken by Mr Alasdair Morrison, the
45-year-old boss of a Jardine associate.

FT  09 MAR 94 / The hazards of bringing home the harvest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Distance lends enchantment to the view - at least, it does when there is a
bull market and the money is flowing freely. Last year the further-flung
securities markets tended to outperform handsomely. In 1994 so far, however,
it has paid to stay closer to home.
That is the viewpoint of the US investor, anyway. Supposedly the recent
shakeout in the global securities markets has been all about a quarter-point
rise in short-term US interest rates signalled on February 4 (admittedly
with the hint that there is a good deal more tightening to come). The
paradox is that although short-term rates have risen nowhere else (and have
fallen in several European countries), the damage to the markets has
generally been worse outside the US.
While the US equity market has only retreated about 3 per cent - as measured
by the FT-Actuaries World Index series - the UK index has fallen by twice as
much, while Mexico is off 11 per cent and Hong Kong by 15 per cent. Only
Tokyo has managed to show some slight appreciation.
As for bond markets, the ten-year US Treasury bond yield may have shown a
sharp upward move of some 56 basis points, but once again things have proved
to be tougher elsewhere, with sentiment in Europe taking another turn for
the worse late yesterday. Returns in the UK have risen by more like 60 basis
points, and the yield on Spanish ten-year government bonds is up by a full
percentage point. Interestingly, Japan has fallen in line as far as bonds
are concerned, with a sharp back-up in yields (the ten-year yield is up more
than 100 basis points since early January).
The Latin American debt markets, so fashionable and lucrative last year,
when the Brady Bond index was up 44 per cent, have taken a tumble. There are
rumblings of further trouble connected with Banco Latino, the failed
Venezuelan bank.
All this presumably says something about the speculative positions that were
built up during the 1993 bull market, as well as the relatively poor
liquidity of some of the smaller national securities markets. The stop loss
selling of hedge funds and investment banks has created more damage in the
minor markets.
The central banks this week decided that the hedge funds were not big enough
to pose any systemic risks. Nevertheless, the changing global patterns
should be watched closely. Volatility is clearly being exported from the US
through cross-border investment. Last year the US equity market varied by
less than 5 per cent either side of the mid-point, much the same pattern as
in 1992. The action shifted with a vengeance to more exotic locations.
When big money is moving in, the risks of investment are clearly seen to be
less, and the riskiest markets show the highest returns through a process of
progression towards the mean. It becomes attractive to chase the
highest-yielding paper and there is a convergence of returns: curiously, the
government paper of European Union member states showed narrower yield
differentials after the effective collapse of the exchange rate mechanism
than before.
When the money moves out, however, the marginal markets tend to be sold
first, as the pricing of perceived risk tends to rise - so that Spanish
bonds, for instance, are hit harder. Or, you could say, the fattest profits
are likely to be cashed in first.
The global investment themes have not been terminated, however, but are more
subdued. We have seen the exit of the hedge funds, which were front running
the pension funds and mutual funds. The US pension funds will probably act
as a stabilising force, seeing higher income returns as attractive.
But the third big group of players, the US mutual funds, may be another
matter. The boom in net receipts continued through to January, at about
Dollars 30bn for bond and equity funds combined, but the February intake may
have been more problematical. The danger arises from the way that mutual
fund investors have been chasing short-term gains, almost as eagerly as the
hedge fund managers. Already the sharp sell-off in Hong Kong and elsewhere
in south east Asia will have inflicted damage and prompted profit-taking.
Global investment can be exciting, but home is where the heart is.

FT  09 MAR 94 / WPP to reduce debt by sale of minority interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WPP, the marketing services group, yesterday announced it is likely to float
part of its market research businesses this year, yielding up to Dollars
200m (Pounds 137m), as part of its efforts to cut debt.
The announcement came as the group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 54.4m
for the year ended December 31, 1993, up sharply from Pounds 7.8m in 1992.
The latest pre-tax profit figure is after charging a loss of Pounds 10.9m on
the sale of companies, against Pounds 28.9m of exceptional items a year
earlier .
A final dividend of 0.65p will make a total payout of 1p per share for 1993
 -the first year a dividend will have been paid since 1990. Fully diluted
earnings per share were 3.4p. The shares rose 2p to close at 125p.
Operating profit for the group - which includes advertising agencies J
Walter Thompson, and Ogilvy and Mather - was up 34 per cent to Pounds 95m,
while operating margins increased from 5.6 per cent to 6.7 per cent.
Billings rose 12 per cent to Pounds 6bn and revenues rose 12 per cent to
Pounds 1.4bn.
Forecasts from the group were cautious yesterday. It announced that 1994
budgets were based on a 1.5 per cent improvement in revenues and, despite an
improvement in confidence in North America and Europe, any recovery was
'still unstable and uncertain'. Tough controls would continue to ensure
'that the group is well placed when real (as opposed to that in the
financial markets) recovery comes'.
Some analysts were surprised by the subdued tone of the statement. Ms Lorna
Tilbian at Warburgs said the results reflected a recovery: 'You don't grow
revenues and increase operating profits so sharply just by management
efforts. You need an underlying recovery and this is evident in the figures.
I just think they're too frightened to say so.' Analysts' forecasts for 1994
pre-tax profits are now about Pounds 85m-Pounds 90m, with some revising
their forecasts slightly downwards.
The flotation of up to 50 per cent of the market research businesses on
either the US or UK stock markets could yield up to Dollars 200m, said the
group. Market research revenues in 1993 were Dollars 320m and operating
profits were Dollars 29m. The companies are based in the US, UK, Australia
and Japan.
If the minority stake were sold for the expected sum, average net
indebtedness could be reduced to Pounds 200m from the 1993 figure of Pounds
339m, said WPP. At the year end, net debt totalled Pounds 84m, down from
Pounds 240m - a sharper reduction than some had expected. The board said
indebtedness and net interest payments were 'manageable' but it continued
'to explore possible asset disposals and other opportunities to improve the
group's capital structure, although on a less pressurised basis'.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Fisons plans cuts as profit tumbles: Drugs side to shed
1,000 jobs - 30% of scientific instruments division to be sold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fisons, the UK pharmaceuticals group which dismissed its chief executive in
December, yesterday said it had identified further scope for cost cutting as
it unveiled a slump in trading profit from Pounds 117m to Pounds 37.4m.
Mr Patrick Egan, chairman, said its cost reduction programme would cut
overheads by an annualised Pounds 38m over two years, compared with the
previous forecast of Pounds 35m.
The programme, which will involve the loss of 1,000 jobs in the
pharmaceuticals division, follows a review by accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand
which cost Pounds 4m.
Mr Egan also revealed the group planned to sell about 30 per cent of its
scientific instruments division, which incurred losses of Pounds 39.6m,
including a restructuring charge of Pounds 20.7m.
In December, Fisons sacked its chief executive, Mr Cedric Scroggs, who had
been directly responsible for the scientific instruments division, and
warned the group would only break even for 1993. The company hopes to
announce a replacement for Mr Scroggs in the next few months. 'We are
absolutely determined to get it right and I am not going to be rushed,' said
Mr Egan.
The figures were also hit by the decision to end the practice of boosting
pharmaceutical sales just before the year-end by offering discounts. This
reduced profits in 1993 by Pounds 32m though Mr Mike Redmond,
pharmaceuticals managing director, stressed: 'We will be selling in January
and February what we would have sold in December.'
After Pounds 40m of exceptional items, trading profit from pharmaceuticals
fell Pounds 29.2m to Pounds 42.2m, with sales from continuing businesses up
7 per cent to Pounds 446m, while profits from laboratory supplies rose from
Pounds 25.9m to Pounds 27.6m.
At the pre-tax line, profits fell from Pounds 124m to just Pounds 1m after
losses on business to be discontinued of Pounds 32.9m. There was a loss per
share of 3.3p, compared with earnings of 13.9p.
Spending on research and development rose from Pounds 64.5m to Pounds 72.5m.
Thanks to disposals, an operating cash outflow of Pounds 69m after tax and
dividends became a cash inflow of Pounds 152m and gearing fell from 67 per
cent to 40 per cent. In line with December's announcement, the final
dividend is cut from 5.4p to 1.0p.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Big losses forecast by Japanese steel groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's five big steelmakers yesterday announced they expect to incur losses
for the year ending this month and with the exception of Nippon Steel, will
be passing their dividend.
The severity of Japan's prolonged economic downturn coupled with the impact
of a high yen will result in a combined pre-tax loss for the industry of
Y114bn (Pounds 726m), even after sales of a substantial amount of
securities, the steel companies said.
Sumitomo Metal Industries, the third-largest integrated steelmaker, is
forecasting the largest loss among the five of Y34bn despite sales of stocks
amounting to Y16bn. It made a profit of Y5.3bn last year.
Nippon Steel, the world's largest steelmaker, is planning to sell a total of
about Y66bn of securities holdings but nevertheless expects a loss of Y19bn,
compared with profits of Y28.9bn in 1992-93.
For Japan's steel industry, this year's results will be some of the worst
figures since the economy suffered the severe impact of the yen's rapid rise
in 1986.
'The trading environment has become extremely difficult,' said Mr Shigeru
Omori, executive vice president of Nippon Steel.
The steelmakers are accelerating restructuring plans, with many announcing
increased cuts in employees, reduced capital expenditure and stringent
reviews of operations. However, personnel reductions will generally be
achieved through natural wastage and transfers to subsidiaries. Some
diversification plans, which were begun as an attempt to reduce dependence
on steel products, are being scaled back or terminated altogether.
Sumitomo Metal, which is shedding 4,300 jobs over the next two years, plans
to reduce general capital spending by half to Y120bn although it will go
ahead with plans to invest Y90bn at its Wakayama plant. Sumitomo also plans
to reduce costs by 15 per cent, or Y150bn by 1995.
However, the decision to pass the dividend reflects general gloom about the
outlook for next year. The domestic situation is unlikely to recover much
and some steel groups expect a further deterioration in results.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Brussels warns German ban on UK beef would be 'illegal'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission warned yesterday that Germany would be breaking
European law if it banned imports of British beef because of fears of 'mad
cow' disease.
Commission officials said any move by Germany, which has threatened a ban
because of its concern over bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), would
almost certainly be met by legal action from the Commission. This would
probably mean an injunction in the European Court of Justice aimed at
forcing the ban to be lifted.
Health ministry officials in Bonn said yesterday that Germany intended to
seek a special session of EU health ministers later this month to discuss a
ban. Bonn has yet to state clearly that it is still prepared to impose
restrictions unilaterally if it fails to persuade its EU partners to impose
a Union-wide ban. Health ministry officials said last week Germany was
prepared to act unilaterally. In Brussels the Commission said: 'There is
only one body that can take a decision to restrict exports in Europe and
that is the Community.'
It added that the Commission had repeatedly told the Germans there was no
scientific evidence to link British beef with another spongiform infection,
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which affects humans.
The warning came as German and British veterinary and health experts met in
Brussels to try to resolve the dispute, inflamed by recent comments from Mr
Horst Seehofer, German health minister, suggesting Germany would restrict
beef imports if the UK did not introduce tighter measures.
Government spokesmen in Bonn and London said there were differences in the
interpretation of scientific evidence. Mr Hartmut Schlegel, at the German
health ministry, said that this meant the Germans still wanted to press
ahead with restrictions.
Mr Rene Steichen, EU agricultural commissioner, has indicated to the German
government that any restrictions would be illegal.
The issue has provoked irritation in Brussels, not least because of its
implications for the Commission's powers and the operation of the single
European market.
A European Commission official said yesterday that Mr Steichen's attitude
was 'if the meat is safe enough for the UK consumer - and we are convinced
that it is - then it is safe enough for the German consumer too'.
Any ban on British beef, the official added, could have broader consequences
for exports of beef, both from the UK and from the EU as a whole.
German suggestions that the EU should take further EU-wide measures against
BSE were unnecessary, the official insisted. EU standards included the
slaughter and destruction of offal of infected cattle, and a ban on exports
from any herd found carrying the disease.

FT  09 MAR 94 / US urges truce to create jobs: Washington says no country
has found 'right approach' to labour market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Washington is calling for a US-European truce to the conflict over which
country has the right policies for creating jobs.
The US should invest more in education and training, while European
countries reform inflexible labour policies and wage-setting restrictions.
This is the central argument of a paper, mainly written by Mr Robert Reich,
the US labour secretary, circulated to Group of Seven governments before
next week's jobs summit in Detroit.
Although the UK government claimed yesterday its deregulatory approach
should be a model for other countries, the US paper says 'no country has yet
found the right approach to adjusting and succeeding in the new world
economy'.
It also emphasises that labour market reform is not a substitute for
creating economic demand. 'Countries that pursue structural improvements
without taking steps to increase aggregate demand will see little or no
return for their efforts.'
This reflects continuing US irritation with the refusal of other G7
countries to adopt more expansionary policies. The paper says a typical
developed country with an annual gain in productivity of 1.5 per cent and
labour force expansion of 0.5 per cent must have economic growth at a real
rate of more than 2 per cent a year just to hold unemployment constant.
It says that over the past two decades Europe has experienced substantial
real wage growth but stagnant employment. In contrast America has
experienced buoyant private sector employment but with growing wage
differentials and declining real pay for less-educated workers.
It adds that the main labour market problem in G7 countries is a shift in
demand from less-educated workers towards workers with problem-solving
skills. But compared with changes in technology, it argues that expanding
trade with lower-cost countries has had only a modest role in this shift.
'Increased globalisation and technological change have raised the knowledge
content of goods in which G7 nations have a comparative advantage. If
properly managed this shift in demand can lead to rapidly growing economies
that produce high-wage, high-skill jobs.'
The paper concludes: 'All G7 countries need to think about improvements in
policies to facilitate transitions from school to work, work to work, and
unemployment to work. All G7 countries need to maintain a commitment to an
open world trading system, but competition should be based on investments in
quality and innovation with workers viewed as assets to be invested in and
not just costs to be minimised'.
Some in the US have argued their country has little to learn about
employment policy from Europe, with its higher unemployment rates, but the
Clinton administration believes it can benefit from European lessons.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Norway nears accord on EU entry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Norway was close last night to agreeing entry terms to the European Union,
joining Sweden, Finland and Austria, which concluded membership negotiations
last week.
But the planned move from 12 to 16 member states by January 1995 was stalled
because the UK and Spain - with lukewarm support from Italy - continued to
refuse to countenance any dilution of their voting rights in an expanded
Union.
At a closed meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels, the nine other current
EU members warned London and Madrid that the enlargement could not go ahead
if they remained obdurate. The Greek presidency of the EU and the European
Commission held bilateral meetings with the British and Spanish foreign
ministers, who were urged to contact their prime ministers, senior EU
diplomats said.
The UK and Spain insist on retaining the existing formula of 23 votes needed
to prevent EU legislation - out of 76 votes distributed among the 12 roughly
according to their size. Their partners want to shift the 'blocking
minority' to 27 votes, to maintain the same percentage in a Europe of 16
sharing 90 votes.
Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, proposed a compromise of moving to
27, plus a committee of representatives of EU heads of government to study
vote distribution before the Union's constitutional review in 1996. The
committee would be mandated to consider British, Spanish, Italian, and
German wishes to get a closer relation between national population and votes
than now exists.
A senior British official said: 'I can assure you there will be no
settlement except on British terms.' Mr Javier Solana, Spanish foreign
minister, said: 'If there is no solution to this problem, we will not
unfortunately be able to celebrate what we all want, enlargement.'
Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister of Germany - which does worst in the new
vote share-out it is advocating in order to get the four applicants into the
Union - said: 'There is no sense in agreeing on 23 (votes) because this will
be rejected by the (European) parliament.'
Amid this test of negotiating nerve, the EU and Norway looked close to
squaring the other enlargement circle - Spanish insistence on recovering
'historic rights' to 7,000 tonnes of Norwegian cod against Oslo's refusal to
concede a single extra fish.
A Commission formula, which both Madrid and Oslo were prepared to consider,
in effect recycles fish quotas Norway conceded when it joined the European
Economic Area free trade zone, which started this year.
That allowed 7,250 tonnes of fish in 1994, rising to 11,000 tonnes in 1997,
for the EU's four poorest countries, nearly half of it earmarked for Spain.
Under the EEA, the Union also gets 2.9 per cent of the Norwegian waters cod
quota - about 40,000 tonnes this year. Norway's much-vaunted fisheries
management foresees rises in the quota, however, and therefore a higher
tonnage for the Union. The Commission proposes that that increment should go
to satisfy Spanish demands.

FT  09 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: WPP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WPP may have lost ordinary shareholders a bundle of money by paying too much
for advertising businesses at the wrong time in the cycle. WPP's bankers,
though, are likely to be a cheerier bunch after cashing in their convertible
shares this year. The bounce in WPP's shares since its refinancing should
enable them to make a tidy turn on the shareholding acquired at the time of
the debt-for-equity swap. Martin Sorrell may join Rupert Murdoch as a
bankers' pin-up boy.
J Walter Thompson and Ogilvy &amp; Mather are performing soundly. Revenue growth
of 4 per cent in constant currency terms stacks up well against comparable
agencies. Group operating margins have also improved from 6.9 per cent to
7.6 per cent before severance payments, yet staff costs remain high in
comparison with those of rivals such as Omnicom. That suggests WPP could
well attain its 10 per cent margin target even though the going gets tougher
from here. WPP's bizarre balance sheet should also regain greater normality
if the company succeeds in floating its market research business. Likely
proceeds of Dollars 200m would certainly make a useful dent in average debt
of Pounds 339m.
The market seems to have forgiven all WPP's past sins and is discounting
much of its future promise, too. WPP's shares again stand on a fancy
premium, which may be fair given its margin recovery and prospects for
advertising growth. Still, WPP's caution about the strength of recovery and
the forthcoming share conversion may dull the immediate shine.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wolff Olins, the identity consultants, have expensively concluded that
orange is distinctive, dynamic, open and positive. It is also, apparently,
simple, friendly and approachable. Most people, however, still think of it
as fruit. Hutchison Telecom's new mobile phone system, Orange, is thus open
to the crack that it is a lemon - particularly since Orange comes from the
company which produced the dead Rabbit network.
The name is doubly unfortunate because the Orange network looks attractive.
Since it will cover the main UK metropolitan areas and the connecting
motorways at launch, it has a significant advantage over its rival, Mercury
One-2-One. Its expansion will also be more rapid. Orange will cover 70 per
cent of the population by the end of the year and 90 per cent by mid-1995.
One-2-One will cover only around 30 per cent of the population by the year
end.
The pricing of calls and handsets, yet to be announced, will put pressure on
margins in the rest of the mobile phone industry. Coverage is wide enough to
make Orange a realistic alternative to Vodafone and Cellnet. They have been
picking up low-use domestic customers, but the old networks' profitability
is critically dependent on their business tariffs. Those fat margins could
be undermined if business users drift to Orange in significant numbers. Wide
coverage and lower handset prices are also a threat to One-2-One. It may
suffer for its decision to constrain capital spending and roll its network
out slowly.

FT  09 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Fisons
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It was something of an achievement for Fisons to deliver yesterday's full
year results without any more nasty surprises. Pharmaceuticals sales growth
of 7 per cent is respectable enough, while the condition of the scientific
instruments division - the cause of December's profits warning - is not
deteriorating. If that record can be maintained, Fisons may finally deserve
to be judged squarely on its recovery prospects. A combination of modest
sales growth, cost savings and loss elimination could, after all, deliver
decent earnings growth.
There are still risks. Drug sales rest on two asthma treatments - Intal and
Tilade - for which the outlook is difficult to judge. Intal faces
competition from cheap generic alternatives. Tilade's US launch seems to be
going well enough, but it is too early to draw firm conclusions.
Disappointment from either drug would undermine any profits recovery. Even
assuming both products perform admirably, Fisons' research pipeline remains
worryingly empty. Licensing potential products from outside companies could
help solve that problem. Since Fisons has a mixed record in development and
lacks a chief executive, though, the omens for such deal-making are not
auspicious. Failure to secure a full raft of promising development projects
would make the marriage of cash-generative laboratory supplies, instruments
and pharmaceuticals difficult to justify. Unless the pipeline can be filled
in short order, breaking Fisons up and finding a partner in pharmaceuticals
may still be the best way of unlocking value.

FT  09 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Manufactured excuses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two worries hit UK equities yesterday. One was the possibility that
January's strong industrial production figures might deter the authorities
from cutting interest rates again; the other was that some large rights
issues were in prospect. If true, the latter would indeed be cause for
concern. There is limited new cash going into the market at present. Any
that is steered towards equities is meeting a plentiful supply of new
issues. Yesterday's 41 point fall is thus partly a measure of how the equity
market, like gilts, has become prey to fears of over-supply.
By contrast interest rate worries look overdone, at least on the basis of
the output figures. These showed output of investment goods rose nearly 4
per cent in January while that of consumer goods fell slightly. That hardly
represents a trend, and investment goods output may simply have been
snapping back after two weak months in November and December. But at least
the picture is consistent with a shift towards investment-led growth that is
needed to make the recovery sustainable.
That should not stand in the way of interest rate cuts. Political pressures
for lower rates are likely to intensify as next month's tax increases bite.
Paradoxically, stronger output figures might even help by signalling rising
productivity. The UK's actual inflation performance is what really counts
for interest rates. The chancellor's life will be harder, though, if gilts
and sterling weaken further because of Germany's reluctance to accelerate
its own rate cuts.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Leading Article: How Europe can compete
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union plc is not engaged in a zero-sum struggle for economic
survival with the US, Japan, or even China Inc. On the contrary, peaceful
economic relations with other economies offer opportunities for mutual
enrichment. The question is whether Europe can take advantage of those
opportunities. Only thus can it hope to offer a steadily rising standard of
living to all Europeans.
The EU has much upon which to build. Its member states possess only 6 1/2
per cent of world population, but generate 25 per cent of global economic
output at market exchange rates, and 18 per cent even at purchasing power
parity. Its disproportionate share in global economic activity, though bound
to fall, demonstrates how large is the reservoir of physical capital, skills
and knowledge on which it is able to draw. Nor has recent overall
performance been notably dismal: total EU output has risen 30 per cent since
1980, the increase being almost as large as China's total gross domestic
product in 1990.
Current gloom is exaggerated, this being partly because of the recession.
But there is reason for gloom, all the same, as the FT series on European
competitiveness, concluded today, has shown. Total EU employment is, for
example, up only 6 per cent since 1980, against 18 per cent in the US;
output of manufactures is up 18 per cent over the same period, against 36
per cent in the US; and the share of EU external exports in world exports of
manufactures is down from 22 per cent in 1980 to 18 per cent in 1992.
Patent filings in Europe have not increased since 1987, while in the US they
have risen by 30 per cent. European spending on research and development has
declined over the 1980s, relative to that in the US and Japan. High
technology products account for nearly a third of US exports, but less than
a fifth of those from western Europe. To this picture should be added the
odd telling vignette. General Electric of the US targets European
competitors, but avoids Japanese ones, while airline operating costs are 48
per cent higher than in the US.
Europe suffers from high unemployment and poor job generation. European
firms tend to be weakest in the world's most dynamic industries. And the
European economy's poorest performance is in industries most exposed to
international competition.
National champions
What lies behind the failures? First, far too much of the European economy
remains shielded from competitive pressures. Second, European monetary
policy has occasionally been seriously misjudged. Third, labour costs are
too high and the labour market as a whole too heavily regulated and taxed.
Finally, business has too often failed to respond to the challenges of the
market place.
Solutions must be found partly at the level of the EU as a whole, partly by
the individual member states and partly by businesses.
Too many sectors of the European economy remain protected from effective
foreign competition and balkanised by the provision of state aids, the
promotion of national champions, the persistence of regulatory barriers and
use of discriminatory public procurement. At least one and often several of
these limitations on competition apply to industries as important and
diverse as agriculture, textiles and clothing, steel, aerospace and defence
equipment, motor vehicles, pharmaceuticals, financial services,
telecommunications, energy supply and civil aviation. Virtually all of them
need to be subjected to greater competition and less protection, a job that
falls to the EU as a whole.
Monetary policy is still a matter for member states, but under the ERM and
now the Maastricht treaty, it is also increasingly a matter for the EU. Here
serious errors have been made, with the current recession partly the result
of an over rigid response to German unification. But now that both inflation
and inflationary expectation in core countries of the EU have been lowered,
the cost of disinflation should not need to be repeated.
Liberal approach
Management of the labour market, training and the welfare state is a task
for member states. They are in a position to choose among elements of
liberal and corporatist approaches to reform.
The liberal approach, often labelled the 'Anglo-Saxon' model, would be based
on labour market deregulation and lower taxes. Its main benefit is likely to
be greater growth of part-time service sector jobs. Its main defect is
likely to be less overall investment in skills and greater inequality in
pay.
The corporatist approach, sometimes called the 'Rhine model', would
emphasise a shift in the tax burden from unskilled to skilled labour,
combined with subsidies to unskilled labour and training, and an effort to
keep the growth of real wages below the growth of labour productivity. The
main benefit of this approach is likely to be more investment in skills and
greater equality among working people. The main drawback is likely to be
less job generation.
What is needed here is more experimentation. Each country can learn from
others. But it can do so only if it is allowed to diverge from the others.
The danger of the EU's social programme is that this desirable diversity
might be prevented.
Finally, searching out market opportunities, exploitation of new scientific
discoveries, linking up with institutions of learning, training workers and
responding to competition fall largely on business itself. Too many
businesses have remained dependent on the state. They must learn to become
dependent on themselves.
There is a great challenge confronting the member states of the EU. It is,
in President Clinton's phrase to 'compete, not retreat'. Much has already
been achieved, in the single market programme, in the moves towards
privatisation and liberalisation, and in the lowering of inflation. But much
also remains to be done.
The temptation to believe that Europeans cannot meet the new global
competition will be strong. But it must be resisted, since a retreat into
the cosy world of protection would doom Europe to rapid relative decline.
Europe will never possess the uniform mass market of the US or the
homogeneous culture of Japan. Its strength lies in its diversity, now
contained within the integrating edifice of the EU. The task facing
politicians is to find effective means of exploiting that diversity in order
to serve the common ends of all its citizens.

Putting a couple of bankers in charge of the Housing Corporation, the
government's biggest quango, is going to ruffle a few feathers. Midland Bank
boss Sir Brian Pearse, the new chairman, is not a housing man and Peter
Cooke, his deputy, made his name as the Bank of England's first proper bank
regulator. What do they know about housing poorer people?
True, Cooke has been on the Housing Corporation board since 1988 and Pearse
knows a bit about the business since he's been lending money to
house-builders for a very long time. Pearse, a Liverpudlian whose face never
fitted in the patrician corridors of Barclays, has more of a social
conscience than some big banking types.
Even so, the arrival of Pearse and Cooke suggests that the government may be
more interested in pandering to the City than to the social housing lobby.
With government housing handouts set to fall, the City is being required to
fill the increasing shortfall.
Meanwhile, having an ex-bank regulator as a deputy chairman may help calm
fears that the Housing Association movement may be becoming a hotbed of
financial hanky-panky with unpaid volunteers handling vast sums of money.

Far from the European Union resulting in some boringly homogenised
bureaucratic idiom, it has actually thrown up some riveting divergences.
Thus British proposals about unemployment have been published with
translations adapted to local sensibilities. In the English text, Europe is
referred to as the (pre-Maastricht) European Community; the French version
calls it the (post-Maastricht) European Union. Thus are sensibilities
soothed.

The idea that Martin Sorrell is about to sell off or float 'up to' 50 per
cent of the market research entities of his mammoth WPP advertising group
needs closer examination. Not to see if it's sensible; with debts of Pounds
361m it clearly is. But Sorrell has talked about doing it for the past two
years - since March 1992 - and little enough has happened so far. Having
worked so hard to build up WPP, Sorrell is not keen to see it fall apart. He
hates the thought of selling anything.

The new Commons select committee on the intelligence services is proving a
useful arena for Douglas Hogg, the Foreign Office minister, to hone his wit
on behalf of the Tories.
Yesterday it listened as Labour member Peter Mandelson - cudgel-wielding on
behalf of the UK's top civil service union, the First Division Association -
asked Hogg what a member of MI6 should do if he or she found a divergence
between their own and the government's definition of 'the interests of
national security'. Hogg thought such a possibility 'inconceivable'.
But what should intelligence officers do if they felt there was a genuine
conflict between how they saw the national interest and how government
ministers regarded it? 'See a counsellor,' murmured Hogg.

Michael Cottrell may have been sipping a bit too much of his own product.
The chairman of Taunton Cider announced a deal selling his up-market scrumpy

A crowing Cottrell reported that, as Molson had an established network of

there are still only 50,' said a puzzled US embassy in London.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Observer: Red in tooth and Klaus
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Vaclav Klaus, the irascible Czech prime minister, was in fine fettle at the
Adam Smith Institute in London yesterday.
'The Czech republic is no longer a post-communist country in transition . .
. Now we're a normal country adjusting to the post-transformation
realities,' he told his pinstriped audience. 'Our inflation is 10.9 per cent
 -but that's annual, not monthly as elsewhere in the post-communist world -
and our unemployment, at 3.8 per cent, is at levels which Mr Major can only
dream of.' Splendid.
Wait a minute. What about the notion that Czech unemployment is relatively
low only because the country has yet really to make a start on painful
economic restructuring?
Steam emerged from Klaus' ears. 'Nonsense,' he barked. High unemployment
comes from slow restructuring; low unemployment from rapid restructuring.
Ergo, the Czech republic's low unemployment is proof of successful, rapid
restructuring.
Breathtaking logic. But Klaus was reminded that restoring government wage
controls last year seemed to contradict his famed love of laisser faire
capitalism. Nonsense again.
'Part of a rational wage policy,' came the huffy reply. And keeping wages
artificially low is of course a million miles away from maintaining
disguised unemployment, that typical feature of socialist full employment.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Awash with uranium: Kenneth Gooding explains the market's
poor prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nobody has been hurt more by the surge in raw materials' exports to the west
that followed the break-up of the former Soviet Union than the uranium
producers. Some are bracing themselves for perhaps 20 more tough years
because military stocks, built up by the superpowers during the cold war,
are becoming available for the first time on world markets.
Russia has agreed that the US can convert highly enriched uranium, used in
nuclear weapons, to low-enriched uranium. This can be blended with other
uranium for use as commercial nuclear fuel. An estimated 500 tonnes of
highly enriched Russian uranium are available, equivalent to 150,000 tonnes
of commercial fuel - enough to keep the west's nuclear reactors supplied for
about three years.
As a result, uranium mines have been closing in Canada, the US and even in
some former eastern bloc countries.
The uranium industry has been in the doldrums for a long time. Prices peaked
at Dollars 45 a pound in 1978, when oil costs were rising sharply and demand
for nuclear energy was expected to grow. (The only large-scale application
of uranium is as a nuclear fuel.)
Over-optimistic forecasts of demand contributed to the build-up of nearly
80,000 tonnes of surplus uranium in stocks at power companies in the 1980s.
The market deteriorated further when brokers and other intermediaries were
allowed to sell some of this uranium to new consumers.
More recently, brokers also gained access to uranium stockpiles in the
Commonwealth of Independent States, as the new republics became desperate
for hard currency earnings.
A great deal of uranium is still sold directly by producers to consumers on
long-term contracts, but enough is sold in the free market for the US and
Europe to worry about the market's over-dependence on CIS material. Some
countries have curbed CIS imports.
Consequently, a two-tier price system has developed. For countries with no
import restrictions, the uranium price is about Dollars 7 a pound, its
lowest ever level in real terms. For those with restrictions on CIS uranium,
the price is about Dollars 10 a pound.
Even at Dollars 10, only the lowest-cost mines (in Australia and Canada) can
break even. However, some producers have unbreakable long-term contracts to
supply utilities at higher prices, even above Dollars 20 a pound. It has
sometimes been worthwhile for them to close mines and buy uranium in the
free market.
According to the Uranium Institute, an international industrial association,
the total supply of freshly produced uranium - from mines and reprocessing
of used nuclear fuel - was only 35,000 tonnes in 1992, compared with demand
for 53,000 tonnes. The gap was made up from the world's large uranium
stockpile.
The institute's present forecasts suggest this imbalance will continue. Even
if all uranium mines worked at full capacity, they could supply only 55,000
tonnes in 2000 and 49,000 tonnes by 2010.
But Mr Peter Wade, managing director of North Broken Hill Peko, a group that
controls the Ranger uranium mine in Australia, says mines would not come
back into production or new ones be developed until prices moved back to
between Dollars 16 and Dollars 18 a pound.
Meanwhile, demand remains sluggish. The institute reckons that it will be
64,000 tonnes in 2000 and no higher in 2010.
The supply deficit cannot continue indefinitely. Eventually the stockpile of
available uranium will be exhausted.
Prices, however, are not expected to recover in the medium term. The
agreement between the US and Russia for converting highly enriched uranium
into power station fuel specifies it should be organised in a way that 'will
have no adverse impact on US consumers or the mining and processing
industries'. But some producers fear that the existence of the extra stock
will give consumers the feeling the world is still awash with excess
uranium, and depress prices for years.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Wonder fuel to burning question: World stockpiles of
plutonium are growing. Clive Cookson and Bronwen Maddox examine the problems
of keeping it safe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON and BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The concrete bunkers along the windswept Cumbrian shore are some of the most
closely guarded places in the world. Inside the heavy doors, a corridor
stretches away for dozens of yards. Sealed trunks are stacked high on each
side, as in a bank vault. Each contains a cylindrical canister 18 inches
high, and within each canister there are smaller ones, like Russian dolls.
At the heart is a white crystalline powder: plutonium oxide.
That is how civil plutonium, produced in the core of the UK's nuclear
reactors, is stored at British Nuclear Fuels' Sellafield site. Its Pounds
2.8bn Thorp reprocessing plant - given final approval to start operating by
the High Court last week - will add 5 tonnes a year to the world's supplies
of usable plutonium by separating the material from used reactor fuel.
The military aspect of plutonium can be seen at the US Department of
Energy's Pantex nuclear weapons facility in Texas, which holds 6,000
grapefruit-sized spheres of pure shiny plutonium metal removed from
redundant hydrogen bombs.
Plutonium is one of the most dangerous substances created by man, taking
account of all its political, economic, military, environmental and
radiological implications. It did not exist on the earth until the 1940s,
when it was created in the laboratories of Los Alamos, deep in the US
desert, in the race to build an atomic bomb.
Now the world has about 1,100 tonnes of plutonium - in weapons, separated
civil plutonium and unprocessed used fuel rods from nuclear reactors -
according to William Walker and Frans Berkhout of the Science Policy
Research Unit at the University of Sussex, who compile the most
comprehensive world inventory of nuclear materials. They say the global
stockpile is increasing by 60 to 70 tonnes every year.
For two decades after it was first created, plutonium was expected to be the
wonder fuel of the future. Governments expected it to become the driving
force of an expanding nuclear industry, as uranium grew increasingly scarce
and costly.
As recently as 1971, Professor Glenn Seaborg, head of the US Atomic Energy
Commission, surmised that 'plutonium could even replace gold as the
international monetary standard - at least it has real intrinsic value'.
Yet today plutonium is widely regarded as a menace with a negative value.
Japan and France, the two countries whose enthusiasm for the civil use of
plutonium lasted longest, are now scaling back their plans for fast-breeder
reactors which generate plutonium by burning uranium.
Last month France announced that it was converting its Dollars 4bn
Superphenix fast breeder, which has been mothballed for the past four years,
into a research reactor to look at ways of burning up plutonium - the
opposite purpose for which it was designed.
Although the Japanese Monju fast breeder will start up this year, several
years behind schedule, its planned successor has been postponed
indefinitely. So has Japan's own reprocessing plant, intended to extract
plutonium and uranium from spent nuclear fuel like Thorp and the equivalent
French plant at Cap de la Hague, Normandy.
French and Japanese enthusiasm has cooled partly because uranium has
remained plentiful and cheap (see below). To a considerable extent, uranium
and plutonium are interchangeable nuclear fuels - and plutonium is so much
more dangerous and more difficult to handle that it will only come into its
own if and when uranium becomes scarce.
At the same time, large fast breeder reactors have proved technically more
difficult and expensive to develop than nuclear engineers had expected.
The plutonium itself has also brought new problems, not anticipated when
these projects began. For a start, it is difficult to store, decaying into
other radioactive substances which are more difficult to handle safely than
pure plutonium. But particular concern now focuses on the threat of weapons
proliferation, and on ways of safeguarding and transporting the growing
plutonium stockpile.
Most of the world's plutonium is mixed up with uranium and other radioactive
waste in used reactor fuel; this cannot easily be made into bombs. The
greater problem arises from the 90 tonnes of plutonium that have been
separated from civil reactor waste, and from the 50 tonnes of excess
military plutonium expected to result from dismantling thousands of Russian
and American nuclear warheads.
Critics of the UK's Thorp reprocessing plant say that it will increase these
dangers by separating out plutonium that would be less of a proliferation
hazard if it remained mixed in with the nuclear waste.
The US National Academy of Sciences reported recently that, contrary to
popular assumption, civil plutonium extracted from reactor fuel is adequate
for making bombs 'of at last 1 or 2 kilotons', equivalent in impact to
1,000-2,000 tonnes of high explosive. The amounts needed are not large - 6
or 7 kilograms, or about a bucketful.
Mr Walter Patterson, an energy analyst at the Royal Institute of
International Affairs, points out that plutonium acquired illegally by
terrorists would probably have undergone radioactive deterioration and would
be unpredictable. 'They couldn't make small, elegant bombs to put on
warheads, but if they were happy to use a pickup truck as a delivery
vehicle, they could still wipe out much of a city,' he says.
A study carried out last year by the Rand Corporation, a US consultancy, for
the Defence Department, concluded that within a decade the world would have
enough surplus plutonium to make 87,000 primitive nuclear weapons.
Faced with continued growth in the plutonium stockpile, governments have
been wrestling with the question of how to put it beyond the reach of
would-be bomb-makers. A favoured option is to combine plutonium with uranium
to burn in existing nuclear power plants as 'mixed oxide fuel', or Mox.
British Nuclear Fuels is pinning its hopes on Mox to soak up much of the
plutonium coming out of its new Thorp reprocessing plant. Although Mox fuel
assemblies have been used on a relatively small scale in pressurised water
reactors (PWRs) since 1963, Mr John Guiness, BNF chairman, predicts that the
technology is about to take off in a big way.
However, Mr Walker and Mr Berkhout at Sussex University believe that BNF is
overestimating the likely popularity of Mox in the next decade, because
straightforward uranium fuel is so much easier to handle. They predict the
amount of separated plutonium will grow by at least 50 tonnes in that
period.
More spectacular suggestions for disposing of surplus plutonium range from
exploding it deep underground to launching it into outer space. Although the
National Academy of Sciences dismisses these as impractical, it favours two
other options: converting plutonium into glass blocks mixed with radioactive
wastes, and burying it in bore holes several kilometres deep.
But such measures cannot provide the whole answer. Nuclear security
specialists say the international system for monitoring and controlling
plutonium also needs urgent improvement. The greatest risk comes not from
plutonium separated by reprocessing in France and the UK, but from material
extracted from former Soviet warheads or produced in reactors in third-world
countries.
North Korea's refusal last year to allow inspections of two sites by the
International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN nuclear watchdog, highlighted the
weaknesses of international agreements for monitoring plutonium and uranium.
It also raises questions about whether the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,
under which signatories must permit these inspections, can survive when it
comes up for renegotiation next year.
The IAEA points out that it will need more resources simply to carry out its
present task of inspecting the world's radioactive sites, a task which is
becoming politically more controversial and technically trickier.
Although the IAEA does not initiate policy, it says its preferred option is
to see international sites developed for stocking the world's plutonium - if
so, Sellafield would be one obvious location. Mr David Kyd of the IAEA
points out that the agency's statutes would allow it to play the role of
plutonium caretaker.
But the problem is too complex to admit an easy answer. Quantities of
plutonium in the world are increasing, even though development of peaceful
uses for the material has been frozen. According to Mr Kyd: 'The point we've
been keen to drive home to people is that there's a problem out there. In
the mid-1990s, as nuclear weapons are dismantled, that problem will get more
acute.'

FT  09 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Tilting windmills
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government will shortly begin to consider which renewable energy
projects should qualify for subsidies under the latest round of the
non-fossil fuel obligation. The Noffo, as it is known, obliges electricity
companies to buy some of their power from generation sources other than
coal, oil or gas, and it finances the extra cost by imposing a levy,
currently 10 per cent, on electricity bills.
Although the greatest proportion of the levy goes to the nuclear power
industry, about Pounds 20m a year is available to support 'green' energy.
The money is allocated through a combination of competitive bidding by
applicants and ministerial judgments.
By all accounts, the new Noffo round will be heavily oversubscribed.
Applicants are proposing a variety of projects ranging from solar and tidal
power to landfill gas and coppicing. But the most numerous contenders by far
are wind farms.
In the past, the subsidy has been seen as a benign element in a worthy
environmental cause. But this time it coincides with an upsurge of public
concern about the proliferation of wind farms in some of the country's most
beautiful landscapes. The allocation of contracts will therefore be subject
to close public scrutiny.
Contrary to the impression environmentalists would like to convey, the case
for renewable energy is not very strong. There is no shortage of energy (the
UK's oil and gas reserves continue to grow, and output is about to set new
records), and there is little domestic technology to protect. The
environmental argument carries some weight, but far greater gains could be
achieved by raising the performance of existing plant than by encouraging
uneconomic green projects.
An efficiency gain of only 3 per cent in energy use would save more
electricity than could be produced from all the renewable energy sources
likely to be up and running by the year 2000 - and would avoid the visual
blight of much green power.
Unfortunately, Noffo money can only be spent on renewables. There is some
consolation in the fact that the system of competitive bidding is a spur to
efficiency. But since the government sees Noffo as a talisman of its
commitment to environmental matters, there is doubt about the rigour with
which it vets the projects which come before it. The only justification for
subsidising any power project, renewable or otherwise, is if it can stand on
its own feet within an acceptable time frame. The taxpayer owes no favours
to green power.

FT  09 MAR 94 / The FT Interview: Corporate camps divide and prosper - Sir
Denys Henderson, chairman of ICI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is only eight months since Imperial Chemical Industries split itself in
two, and already the world seems almost to have forgotten the fact. Two
weeks ago, the first full-year figures from the new ICI passed off without
fanfare. Last week's results from its sister company Zeneca were equally
routine. One of the most drastic upheavals in British corporate history
seems to have passed off with scarcely a ripple.
This arouses mixed emotions in the breast of Sir Denys Henderson, chairman
of both ICI and Zeneca. On the one hand, he argues, silence suggests the
demerger was a good thing. If it had shown signs of going wrong by now,
'everybody would have been jumping up and down pointing out what a balls
we'd made of it'.
So far, the evidence is all the other way. ICI's pre-tax profits last year
were up 78 per cent, Zeneca's 42 per cent. More fundamentally, since the
demerger was announced in July 1992, the combined value of the two companies
has risen by two-thirds, while the stock market has risen only by half.
On the other hand, Sir Denys is plainly irked that so little credit has been
given for what he calls 'the greatest management story never written'. As he
tells it, the main feature of the exercise was the sheer hard slog involved:
not just hammering out the basic plan, but then sorting out the legal,
fiscal and commercial tangle of splitting up 500 companies and 130,000
people across the world.
This prompts an obvious question. Before demerging, ICI reviewed all its
strategic options. The one it plumped for was the most risky and
time-consuming. Given the drawbacks, what made demerger so very desirable?
Sir Denys has the answers off pat. Consider, he says, how the world of the
1990s differs from anything that has gone before. Economic growth is going
to be slow and painful. The classical chemical industry has largely run out
of ideas. It faces competition from new parts of the world, such as the Asia
Pacific region, and is obliged to spend more on the environment than it can
readily afford. The collapse of communism has created chaos in the markets
of eastern Europe, and has harmed a valuable customer in the form of the
defence industry.
Fair enough. But still, why was demerger the best answer? The answers here
are murkier, since they concern not only external factors but the internal
workings of ICI. The truth seems to be that demerger was the only way to
address flaws inherent in the ICI culture; and Sir Denys, a company man to
his backbone, is not about to criticise ICI if he can help it.
To begin with, it is clear that the abortive raid on ICI by the acquisitive
conglomerate Hanson in May 1991 was more formative than ICI has previously
cared to admit. It caused Sir Denys and his board colleagues to address
themselves afresh to two central constituencies: ICI's shareholders, and its
managers. The response from both was unsettling.
'We had the naive belief,' Sir Denys says, 'that in the heart of every fund
manager was a little bit labelled ICI.' In fact, many of the institutions
proved indifferent or hostile. At the same time, the directors sounded out
their senior managers. Again, Sir Denys says, the reaction was unexpected.
'They clearly did not wish to have Hanson come in, but equally they were
less convinced about the cohesion of ICI and the synergy across the group
than we had imagined.'
The important point here is that if Hanson were to bid, it would have been
on the basis of a break-up. The obvious defence would be that ICI was an
indivisible entity. Its managers were no longer sure about that. Nor, on
reflection, were the directors.
The purpose of a break-up would be to release shareholder value. This was a
point on which ICI's directors were becoming increasingly aware of their
shortcomings. Historically, Sir Denys says, shareholders had occupied a
humble position in the ICI scheme of things. 'A predecessor of mine - no
names, no pack drill - said to me, 'Denys, you seem to spend a lot of time
worrying about the share price. I'm not bothered about it. I just want to
get the technology right'.'
Historically, this is unsurprising. The 1950s and 1960s were a period of
phenomenal growth for the chemicals industry. 'Even when I joined ICI in
1959,' Sir Denys says, 'we had sales control departments. You could sell
every damned thing you could make.'
In spite of oil shocks and recessions, traces of this attitude seem to have
survived into the 1990s. The chief executives of the individual businesses,
Sir Denys says, were slow to accept that shareholder relations, dividends,
tax and interest bills at the corporate level were their concern. This, he
says, lay at the heart of a further problem: that they were unduly
optimistic about what they could achieve.
As a result, he says, ICI's investments had not been delivering the goods.
The remedy was plain: 'The CEOs needed to understand that there had to be a
corporate performance and a corporate relationship with shareholders.'
The reaction of these same CEOs to the demerger proposal was thus crucial.
Ten days before the demerger was made public, they were summoned to the head
office. The message was that the board was unhappy with their results and
wanted them to explain themselves.
'They all came in, somewhat apprehensive,' Sir Denys says. 'I started off by
saying: 'we aren't happy, that's all true, but there's a little bit more
than that'.' On being told of the demerger, he says, 'they were first of all
stunned, then their reaction was universally favourable.'
Ten days later, at the final briefing, some were showing signs of second
thoughts. 'There was a feeling of 'hmm - this is going to carry more
exposure with it. With greater responsibility comes greater
accountability'.'
According to Sir Denys, though, the first reaction proved the right one. The
CEOs, he says, have enjoyed a release of energy. 'There is a better
interaction with the centre. They have a better opportunity to put across
their viewpoint, not just on their individual business but the company as a
whole.'
One practical instance is that both Mr Ronnie Hampel, chief executive of the
demerged ICI, and Mr David Barnes, his opposite number at Zeneca, now have
regular monthly meetings with their CEOs. In the old ICI, Sir Denys says,
this was not feasible.
When I was first a division chairman, I used to go to the quarterly business
meetings which the main board would have with the equivalent of the business
CEOs. They were pretty useless meetings. Everybody was busy showing what a
splendid chap he was and how well his business was doing.'
ICI, in short, was suffering from a baronial culture, in which the chiefs
were more concerned with competing than with the corporate good. Sir Denys
points out, a touch defensively, that in any large corporation there will
always be tension between the centre and the individual businesses. But the
real snag about the baronial culture, it is clear, was that it made it
harder to allocate capital for investment.
'We were too much concerned with fair shares for all,' Sir Denys concedes.
As a result, some of ICI's more geriatric businesses - Sir Denys's phrase -
were cross-subsidised when they should have been given the bullet.
A large part of the argument for demerger is that in the 1990s, speed of
response is more essential than ever before. Hence the case for demerger,
whereby the suppression of sectoral interests allows faster reaction towards
a common purpose.
But as Sir Denys freely admits, structural change is only the starting
point. 'Be clear on one thing,' he says. 'It will be quite a while before
each company proves how it can grow. None of us saw this as a magic wand.
It's the opening of a door, and it's saying to each company 'you have a new
start, but you've got to get on and deliver'.'

FT  09 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Non-executives' role was the focus of
quotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr OWEN GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Sir David Plastow's letter ('Non-executive directors' input is
invaluable', March 5) appears to be a delayed knee-jerk reaction to my Pall
Mall lecture.
A reader may prefer my generally accepted, though quite sparing, use of
hyperbole - 'blunting the edge' - in making a point, to his somewhat crude
rebuttal - 'ill-informed nonsense'.
After all, one does not need to have been an automotive engineer in order to
recognise the difference between the essentials of a vehicle and its trim.
As a matter of record, the quotation related not to non-executive directors
as such but to those requirements of a code which over-emphasise their
monitoring role; their independence from the business of the company; and to
their control over decision-making activities.
Sir David has been fortunate, or otherwise, in that his many experiences
appear to have arisen through company needs rather than from regulatory
requirements.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Allies' shaky footing: Croats and Bosnian Moslems make
uneasy partners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is it war or peace?
Peace, but not the kiss of peace.
A patched up affair, if you ask
my opinion.
And if you ask me, I think that
this peace
Is nothing like an end, nor like
a beginning.
TS Eliot - Murder in the Cathedral
Such is most people's instinctive reaction to last week's US-brokered
agreement be-tween Croats and 'Bosniacs' (Bosnian Moslems). It came so
suddenly, after nearly a year of savage fighting, in which both sides
emulated the methods used earlier by the Serbs to 'cleanse' the territory
they held of other ethnic groups.
Publicity about the Croat-Moslem war has focused on the plight of the
Moslems in and around Mostar, and on the intervention by the Croatian
regular army. This partly obscured the fact that in central Bosnia the
Moslems have been winning the war and the Croat inhabitants have fled from a
string of towns: Travnik, Bugojno, Fojnica, Konjic, Kakanj and others.
That explains the US-brokered agreement. The policy pursued by President
Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, which was to support a separate Croat state of
'Herceg-Bosna' as the prelude to an eventual partition of Bosnia-Hercegovina
between Croatia and Serbia, has proved a disaster for the Croats. The
Croatian army had not succeeded in retrieving this disaster, but its attempt
to do so had brought down the west's wrath on Croatia's head.
In Croatia itself, the increasingly visible alliance with Serbia was
unpopular. All over Croatia there are refugees from the areas, amounting to
roughly one-third of the republic's territory, which were conquered by Serb
forces in 1991. These refugees, and many of their fellow-citizens, were
outraged at the sight of their own government conniving with the Serbs in
the carve-up of Bosnia.
So Mr Tudjman was glad enough to use US pressure and mediation as cover for
his admission of defeat - just as President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia,
and the Serb leaders in Bosnia, seized on Russian intervention to cover
their retreat when faced with a serious threat of Nato air strikes.
The Nato action may also have helped to swing Mr Tudjman round. Croatia,
whose whole raison d'etre as an independent state derives from its
self-image as part of the west (in contrast to the 'Byzantine' Serbs), could
not possibly take the Serb side once a serious confrontation developed
between Serbia and the west. If the west is now at last getting tough with
the Serbs, Croatia is bound to put itself on the western side, in the hope
of regaining control of its lost territory.
That indeed is the explanation of his volte-face that Mr Tudjman gave to the
Croats. For him the agreement is not really about Bosnia at all. A deal with
the Bosnian Moslems is simply the price the US requires Croatia to pay for
help in recovering Krajina. It seems there is some truth in this
presentation of the matter, since US spokesmen have started saying that
sanctions on Serbia will not be lifted until the Krajina issue is resolved.
Meanwhile, it is not entirely clear how the Bosnian government interprets
the Washington agreement. Most international reaction has taken it as a step
towards a 'two-republic solution' in Bosnia, based on the acceptance that
the Serbs of Bosnia will have a separate state of their own, linked to
Serbia, and that therefore it makes sense for the Moslems and Croats to pool
their resources and develop links with Croatia. This interpretation seemed
to be confirmed by the Bosnian prime minister, Haris Silajdzic, when he said
in Washington last week that Russian pressure is needed to get the Serbs to
agree to a negotiated solution.
But another interpretation is doing the rounds in the small pro-Bosnian
lobby in London. According to this view, the new Croat-Moslem alliance is a
step towards the defeat of Serbia. The Bosnian army has proved itself in
battle against the Croats, but also against the Serbs, for instance near
Banja Luka where small groups of Bosnian partisans have held far more
heavily armed Serb forces at bay. Now, with or without a formal lifting of
the arms embargo, the Bosnian army will be strengthened by the Croats'
change of sides and the opening of supply routes from the coast.
Such hopes are mirrored by Serb fears, as reported in an AP despatch from
Banja Luka at the weekend. The author, Julijana Mojsilovic, reports Serb
fighters as dreading a Moslem spring offensive. Superior Moslem numbers and
morale are beginning to tell in thickly-wooded terrain where heavy artillery
is of little use.
It is tempting to believe that the hold of Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Serb
leader in Bosnia, and his thugs could be broken by a short, sharp spring
offensive with western support. It is tempting to believe that the Serbs
would then agree to peace on similar terms to the Croats, joining the new
federal republic, while Serbia itself could join the proposed confederation
with Bosnia and Croatia - thereby recreating a loose, confederal Yugoslavia
such as the Croats and Slovenes were demanding before the war broke out.
Tempting, but dangerous. It is good that the Serbs should fear a spring
offensive, since without that fear they are unlikely to make the territorial
concessions which are essential for a two-republic solution to work. But the
Bosnian government would be taking a risk with the lives of its own citizens
if it spurned such a solution and staked everything on a continuation of the
war. And those in the west who support the Bosnian cause would take a great
moral risk if they encouraged the government to adopt that course.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Prominent criticism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GRAHAM J CHAMBERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Savic (Letters: 'A lesson for the self-righteous', March 5) suggests
that Malaysia 'is reacting to the proposition that the British and other
western governments . . . generally know better'.
Dr Mahathir said nothing like that. The Malaysian prime minister's
grievance, as the FT editorial comment (February 28) stated, is with the UK
press, and as the wealthy libel lawyers would perhaps testify, he is not
alone.
If Mr Savic thinks the Murdoch press is in hock to the government, then many
hapless members of this administration can draw comfort from avoiding the
mauling they might have received from a less sympathetic organisation.
As far as the government is concerned, you quote the essential charge as
being one of hypocrisy. If that is all, then we can all sleep easily, as
nothing fundamental has changed. Linking money to services provided is not
new. I understand it has even been known to happen in journalism.
However, Mr Savic may wish to ponder the premise that, if the situation had
been reversed, would a similarly critical letter have received as much
prominence in Malaysia's New Straits Times?

FT  09 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Serious fraud investigations should
not take forever
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID LLOYD-JACOB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You report that in response to a parliamentary question about the
Serious Fraud Office's investigation of matters involving the flotation of
this company, the attorney-general said that the investigation was being
'pursued rigorously' ('Call for early Butte inquiry verdict', March 1).
The attorney-general is no doubt practised at believing the improbable.
The truth of this matter is that the Serious Fraud Office investigation, for
the first 18 months, was understaffed and ill-directed.
It has been much improved in the last two months, however.
This is not a criticism of the individual police officers, who have behaved
excellently; it is a criticism of their direction, and of the inappropriate
nature of the resources allocated by the SFO to investigate a Pounds 100m
fraud.
It would be a pity if it were generally believed that serious fraud
investigations in Britain had to take forever and be done badly.
With proper briefing and direction, successful fraud investigation in cases
such as Butte should take months, not years.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: CAP reforms or protectionism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From JORG SCHIMMELPFENNIG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The warning issued by Mr Rene Steichen, EU agriculture commissioner
('East Europeans warned against farm protectionism', March 4), reveals the
blatant arrogance of the Common Agricultural Policy.
As Professor Paul Krugman has shown in a seminal article published in 1985,
in an industry exhibiting increasing returns to scale - such as agriculture
 -import protection is in many ways equivalent to export subsidisation.
The intuitive idea is easy to grasp: by hindering farm inputs, domestic
agricultural production is increased, per unit costs are reduced and, thus,
export chances enhanced. By the same argument, a popular fallacy about the
CAP can be exposed as well: instead of assisting developing countries by
lowering their food prices, it cripples their farming industries and
deprives them of foreign exchange earnings.
Consequently, Mr Steichen's demands amount to nothing else but denying east
European countries the same weapon the EU is employing against them. Without
any real CAP reforms, we shouldn't be surprised to see agricultural
protection continue its disastrous spread.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Cosy club where favours can be
reciprocated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BILL BUDDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am not surprised by the praise that Sir David Plastow heaps on to
non-executive directors (Letters, March 5). He would say that, wouldn't he?
Of course he wishes to perpetuate this cosy club within which chairmen may
reward others for past favours or grant retainers and expenses for a few
days' attendance a year in exchange for the same favour on the other's
board. It is also a means of enhancing pensions for retired MPs and others.
Do Americans call them freeloaders?
I recall the high numbers of non-execs who served on the boards of some of
our one-time great companies like Rolls-Royce and Dunlop before they went
into decline. I remember how many times, when the Serious Fraud Office has
been called in elsewhere, the non-execs have departed crying: 'These facts
were not available to me.'
Why is it that company directors think they should receive several
concurrent incomes at shareholders' expense?
I applaud the policies of BTR, Lonrho and Amstrad. Who is Cadbury anyway?

FT  09 MAR 94 / Arts: So far, it's still looking good - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
During the last few years as the government has driven British television
further and further into the marketplace - (Well that system has triumphed,
hasn't it? Socialism is dead isn't it? Why should television be unaffected?
No doubt the long march back to a sane mixture of market and social
economics will take a whole generation) - with ITV licences being auctioned,
Channel 4 made to sell its own advertising time and compete with ITV, and
the BBC's income ever more closely scrutinised and controlled, this column
has tended to make Cassandra-like warning noises about the quality of
programmes.
The argument has been that a fiercer fight for audience share would mean
increasing concentration on populist programmes and the reduction or even
abandonment of those admirable traditions which, in addition to populist
material, Britain's peculiar television 'duopoly' had been bringing us for
40 years: current affairs in mid evening, classic drama, properly funded
foreign coverage, arts programmes, serious documentaries on subjects other
than prostitution and transvestites, and comedy which goes beyond 'Ding-dong
Honey I'm home' to push and even kick at the existing limits.
Though the BBC's problems will probably never be entirely soluble, as was
suggested in an oddly ambivalent opening programme in a new run of The
Goldring Audit on Channel 4 on Sunday, and ITV has been operating under its
auctioned licences and its new central scheduling system for only 14 months,
with Channel 4 fending for itself for the same period, the time has come for
a cautious admission that - so far, anyway - the sky has not fallen. We are
not being subjected to an unrelieved diet of populism.
That is not to deny that there is a lot of it about. From The Big Breakfast
on Channel 4, aimed at toddlers of all generations, to Talking Telephone
Numbers on ITV, a sort of game show without a game; from a copy of an amoral
Brazilian series on BBC1, Do The Right Thing, with Terry Wogan, to the
sub-panto game show Don't Forget Your Toothbrush on Saturday nights on
Channel 4, the mindless, time-passing bonhommie spreads and multiplies. Yet
any honest viewer would have to admit that British television is still
offering more good and even excellent material than any well balanced
individual ought to have the time to watch. Perhaps it is not scheduled as
you might wish, but what is the point of a video recorder?
This new year season has already brought us Middlemarch from the BBC, an
adaptation which was not as good as some devotees pretended, nor as good as
the best literary adaptations in the past, Bleak House for instance, and
Brideshead Revisited. One of the greatest strengths of the television
Brideshead came from John Mortimer's decision to use the authorial
voice-over throughout. Why it was decided with Middlemarch to throw away
this invaluable technique by limiting it to a postscript (read in the
unmistakeably mumsy tones of Judi Dench) is a mystery. However, even without
it, this was an impressive series which showed that the BBC can - and will -
still do it.
It now seems highly unlikely, barring more radical changes, that ITV will
ever do another Brideshead, but on Monday they did begin another batch of
Granada's splendid Memoirs Of Sherlock Holmes, 60-minute costume dramas
complete with hansoms, country house locations and, this week, a costume
ball with fountains and fireworks. Best of all Jeremy Brett and Edward
Hardwicke are still playing Holmes and Watson, the best pair ever to do so
on screen. Nor are we limited to fiction from previous centuries. BBC2 began
another season of 'Screen Two' with the extraordinary Genghis Cohn, a
production with the chutzpah to use comedy as a means to look again at the
holocaust. With wonderful performances from Antony Sher as the Dachau ghost
and Robert Lindsay as the former SS officer who shot him, it was perpetually
watchable even if the ultimate purpose was obscure.
So far as current affairs in mid evening are concerned, until three weeks
ago there was as much as ever: World In Action is still at 8.30, Dispatches
(which offered an interestingly alternative view to the government's on
Britain's mining industry last week) at 9.00, and Panorama at 9.30. True, at
present The Big Story, which replaced This Week on ITV, has itself been
replaced by The Big Race which, lacking competitors, ought really to be
called 'The Long Drive'. However, ITV has been as good as its word on
Network First (a dreadfully unmemorable title in place of First Tuesday) and
two weeks ago screened the film about a massacre in East Timor, made
clandestinely by John Pilger and David Munro. As usual with this pair it is
now causing a huge political row, which is presumably just what they wanted.
We are getting more vivid and engrossing foreign coverage in Phil Agland's
Channel 4 series Beyond The Clouds which is documenting life in a Chinese
country town and coming over as a cross between Margaret Mead and Coronation
Street, all displayed in Agland's startlingly beautiful photography. And on
Monday BBC2 began Video Nation, a huge 'Mass Observation' style programme in
which 55 video cameras have been given to 55 widely assorted people
throughout Britain. Remembering the striking success of the Video Diaries
scheme, this could prove to be very special - particularly if BBC2 can be
persuaded to show it in bursts of more than two minutes.
To make us laugh we have The Day Today, a series which is not only one of
the most original comedies for years, but one of the most effective pieces
of television criticism. Trevor McDonald and Jeremy Paxman now appear to be
mimicking their detractors in a. Madly determined effort to. Confirm all
those quirks which. The Day Today has so accurately identified.
Of course I may be speaking too soon. It could be that British television
today is in much the same condition as the optimist who was pushed off the
roof of the Empire State building and was heard as he passed the 44th floor
to be muttering 'So far, so good'. It does seem only fair, however, to
acknowledge that - for the moment - the best of British television is still
looking pretty impressive.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Arts: Flamboyant director of Rome Opera resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNIFER GREGO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Giampaolo Cresci, controversial director of Rome Opera, has resigned. His
sudden departure from the post, two years before his contract was due to
expire, ends a flamboyant regime marred by a L35bn (Pounds 14m) deficit,
spectacular backstage rows and talk of scandal.
In the latest crisis, Cresci was summoned to appear in court with the singer
Jose Carreras over allegations that the opera house paid the Spanish tenor
an unauthorised extra L130m - on top of the normal fee of L30m plus L10m
expenses - for a recital in October 1992.
The public prosecutor claims that a decision was taken to make an extra
payment to Carreras and describe it in accounts as 'sponsorship'. Magistrate
Filippo Laviano is seeking to try Cresci on charges of abuse of office.
Carreras' agent, through his lawyer, denies any wrongdoing on the part of
his client, saying that the singer was paid rather less than his usual fee.
The agent does not, however, disclose the sum actually paid.
The allegations follow a succession of sackings and rehirings and
accusations of extravagance of heroic proportions recalling, according to
one Italian newspaper, a Byzantine court in the last stages of decadence. A
payment of L27m was allegedly made for unnecessary English language courses
for the opera house fire brigade. L51m went towards a New York production of
Aida which never took place. Recently, more than 1,200 operatic costumes
were impounded by a renovation company, which threatens to sell the costumes
at auction in May if the opera house does not pay its bill of L1.25bn.
There have also been accusations by Roman concert institutions that the
opera house filched artists under exclusive contract to them (Rockwell Blake
from the Accademia Filarmonica Romana and Georges Pretre from Santa Cecilia,
who was later forced to return).
So catastrophic was the financial situation at the opera house that the
'Green' mayor of Rome, Francesco Rutelli, appointed himself Rome Opera
commissioner and delegated the unravelling of the theatre's finances to
Vittorio Ripa di Meana.
'We can no longer allow the director to continue,' said Rutelli. 'We have
already waited far too long as more and more terrible stories about the
financial mess at the opera emerge every day.' Cresci was unperturbed and
dismissed the deficit as 'a mere trifle . . . no more than the cost of a few
tanks.' He went on to add, with unnerving candour, 'only an infinitesimal
part of it went into bribes.'
Last week, both Rutelli and di Meana resigned in exasperation at Cresci's
intransigence and the deputy prime minister, Senator Antonio Maccanico, was
obliged to step in. By the weekend, it was Cresci's turn to step down and
his resignation was accepted, while Rutelli and di Meana agreed to return to
their posts.
The queue to take over the job of director of Rome Opera, dubbed by Riccardo
Muti as 'Barnum's Circus', is not enormous. It is viewed by some as a
poisoned chalice. Mayor Rutelli's choice, Sergio Escobar of the Bologna
Comunale, has already let it be known that he would rather remain where he
is. The search for a successor goes on.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Arts: Sacred fires flare amid quaint Flamenco capers -
Clement Crisp finds the Cristina Hoyos troupe has that uninhibited, raw,
earthy energy after all
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Spanish Arts Festival is upon us and dance must inevitably play its part.
So the Cristina Hoyos troupe is in Rosebery Avenue this week, with the
spectacle given the unlikely title of 'Flamenco Dreams': anyone able to
dream through the rattle of handclaps and the clatter of feet will deserve a
medal. It is of course, yet another Flamenco show; more slick than most -
well staged; well danced; well vocalised in those arabesques of howling that
suggest permanent pressure on a favourite corn - and absolutely the mixture
as before.
The fascination of Flamenco in the theatre is that moment when production
falls away, the usual posturings are stilled, and the sacred fire flares in
a dancer. For much of Monday night's opening at Sadler's Wells,
predictability was all. The women, adept at slow-burning glances as their
skirts stir up the stage dust, look lovely - if occasionally miffed by what
the men are up to. The chaps, in buttock-hugging trousers and expressions of
baleful uncertainty, stamp, and go on stamping. ('Never live under a
Flamenco dancer,' is a good rule for flat-dwellers.) Guitars run the gamut
of tonic/dominant harmonising, and voices are raised in what I suppose is
supplication. I have no Spanish, but suspect that the texts amount to little
more than 'Watch out, she's on the war-path'.
All this is what we have come to expect, and if, as with Mme Hoyos' troupe,
it is polished and well-lit, then audiences are happy. They are what
theatricalised folk dance is always about: instant quaintness and capers
designed for tourists. But in this packaging one may, as in a lightning
flash, discern the real thing. The greatest Flamenco artists spontaneously
combust. As Isadora Duncan said after one extraordinary performance: 'The
god was with me'. So with the inspirational flamenco style. Carmen Amaya,
the truest Flamenco dancer I have seen, was, at her most intoxicating, a
gypsy divinity pursued by demons. Cumbre Flamenca, at the Wells a few years
ago, showed us two other marvels: Carmen Cortes and La Chana, whose art
became incandescent with rhythm and the very spirit of the dance.
With Cristina Hoyos, I feared that this transcendent moment might not
arrive. Her initial appearance - red flounces; arching torso; a star dancer
on display - told of obviously fine qualities that have always been hers:
glorious arms; electric timing. Yet it was an exteriorised performance, and
like most of what we saw, brilliantly contrived. Then, in a Taranto, Mme
Hoyos came on stage in a simple grey dress, as if to confront her art and
her own talent. Guitarists and singer started to commune with her. Urgent
rhythms, awkward poses, the dance kicking and battling, inhabited her
totally, and we saw the real, the raw and earthy flamenco which is so
wonderful - and so rare. Her arms curled around the block of her torso; the
music's pulse drove her feet and legs; nothing was polite, and everything
was thrillingly true. The god was with her, and we rejoiced.
Lest I seem in the least sniffy about the Hoyos troupe, let me say that
every artist is gifted, each number well-staged, and that prodigies of
stamping and rhythmic acuity abound. Adrian Galia is a most stylish soloist
 -his solo farucca tautly elegant. The evening runs to 100 minutes without
an interval.
Cristina Hoyos is at Sadler's Wells until March 12. Sponsored by Hola and
BSIS. Festival sponsors include Royal Bank of Scotland; Banco Santander;
BSIS; BT.

In today's 'Screen Two' drama well known actors (Richard Briers, Bernard
Hill, Billie Whitelaw) star alongside disabled people. Skallagrigg, is
adapted from the novel by William Horwood. The title refers to a mythical
figure, the hero of stories told by disabled people in hospitals all over
the country. Esther, a teenager born with cerebral palsy, undertakes a quest
to find this character (9.00 BBC2).
Dispatches reports on the case of Paul Grecian who was convicted of selling
arms to Iraq in what sounds like a dress rehearsal for the Matrix Churchill
scandal (9.00 C4).
What is a trebuchet and why has Huw Kennedy been trying for 30 years to
build one? According to the English dictionary it is a medieval siege engine
using a balanced arm with a weight on one end to sling projectiles at town
walls; rather like putting a kitten on a seesaw and dropping an elephant on
the other end. My 1924 'Petit Larousse' has a tiny but detailed drawing
which shows they were about five times the height of a man. Working Parts
(9.45 C4) follows Kennedy's attempts to build one.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Business and the Environment: Green legislation will test
Tokyo's sincerity - Japan is sharpening up its environmental policy, reports
Emiko Terazono in the latest in a series / Worldwide waste
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a recent letter to more than 600 Japanese manufacturers, Wakako Hironaka,
chief of the country's Environmental Agency, urged business leaders to
invest in environmental technology to help the struggling economy.
Although the Japanese government has embraced the green issue over recent
years to enhance its international image, it has done little to lay down
legislation defining industry's role in environmental protection or imposing
standards for industrial waste.
Just how genuine the government is over its pledge to become more green will
be tested later this year when it produces specific legislation to follow up
the Basic Environmental Law, a broad policy statement passed by parliament
last November.
After rapid economic growth in the 1950s and 1960s, a public outcry over the
sharp rise in pollution forced the government to lay down strict
anti-pollution laws. Cases such as the Minamata disaster, where toxic
mercury was dumped into the coast of a small seaside town in southern Japan,
or the Yokkaichi air pollution scandal, in which residents of an industrial
town in central Japan suffered severe respiratory problems due to the air
pollution from chemical plants, led to litigation by victims.
After numerous lawsuits against manufacturers and the government, tough laws
controlling air and water pollution were passed. Companies rushed to spend
on pollution control, investing 17 per cent of total capital investment at
the peak in 1975.
However, green legislation has hardly changed since then. 'Japan's
philosophy towards the environmental issue hasn't developed in the last 20
years,' says Ian Austin, the Tokyo-based director of Japan business
development at Dames &amp; Moore, the US environmental consultancy. Because
Japan's industrial waste policy remains lax compared with that of the US and
Europe, the financial burden on corporations remains almost non-existent.
The agency had initially intended the Basic Environmental Law to include the
implementation of a tax to limit carbon dioxide emissions and to make it
obligatory for companies to conduct environmental impact assessments. But
opposition from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) and
the construction ministry led to the law being watered down.
Soil pollution from industrial waste landfills is expected to pose a problem
for the Japanese government and companies in the next few years.
Legislation covering user charges, which require companies to pay for
collection and treatment of polluted waste, will have to be implemented,
since the cost of closing down and cleaning up industrial waste landfills is
expected to be enormous.
From its experience with Minamata, the agency realises that clean-up is more
costly than prevention. The agency says that because Chisso, the chemical
company responsible for the Minamata poisoning, had neglected to spend an
annual Y100m (Pounds 645,000) in pollution prevention, its liabilities,
including compensation to the victims and local fishermen, grew more than
100 times to an adjusted Y11.9bn a year.
Austin says that leading multinational companies in the European Union and
the US are already applying environmental management policies to their
operations in Japan to avoid possible future liabilities.
Japanese businesses, meanwhile, have seen profit opportunities in the
development of green technology, and have also adopted action plans to show
that they are already environmentally sound, and do not need further
legislation.
In 1991, the Keidanren, Japan's leading business federation, produced a
policy statement which said companies should put board members in charge of
environmental matters, while in 1992 Miti laid down a 'voluntary plan
concerning environmental matters'.
Although such pronouncements have mostly sounded superficial, some companies
claim to be sincere. Toyota Motor says it will start producing cars in which
85 per cent of the body and engine parts can be recycled, while Toshiba has
stopped using ozone-depleting CFCs to clean its computer chips. Kao, the
detergent and consumer goods maker, promises to cut its industrial waste by
50 per cent by the end of next year.
But some companies' behaviour overseas may not be consistent with the way
they do business in Japan. Mitsubishi Kasei, the chemicals group, was forced
to close its chemical plant in Malaysia after local activists' allegations
of radioactive waste. Although Mitsubishi overturned a decision by the
Malaysian court in 1992 to terminate operations, the case damaged the
company's image and it pulled out anyway.
In seven years, companies will run out of industrial waste sites, and some
Japanese general construction companies have started to develop industrial
waste and soil pollution technologies ahead of likely controls.
Next week: Germany.

The CBI has appointed John Parsons as chairman of its Small Firms Council.
Parsons is chairman and chief executive of Time and Data Systems
International, a Poole-based company which makes electronic security
systems.
He replaces Richard Brucciani who steps down at the end of the standard
two-year period.
Parsons was a member of the British Overseas Trade Board from 1985 to 1993
and of a DTI national advisory group on the impact of the single European
market on small and medium-sized companies.
Parsons, who received a CBE in 1988 for services to export, appears to have
few illusions about what smaller companies can achieve in terms of growth
and job creation.
'Small businesses are recognised as the leading job creators and an
important source of economic growth,' he says. 'However, most of this comes
from a relatively small proportion of dynamic firms which have the potential
to grow.'

FT  09 MAR 94 / People: Earl returns to UK via Everest and Albania
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Earl, the corporate financier who last year was joint leader of the
Rebecca Stephens Everest expedition, is joining US investment banking
boutique Fieldstone Private Capital Group to set up a 'mainstream' corporate
finance function from London.
Fieldstone was started in 1990 by a team of structured finance specialists
who had previously worked for Bankers Trust in New York and London. While it
is hardly a household name, even in the City, it was last year ranked second
in worldwide project finance by the specialist publication International
Financing Review.
It has also had a hand in financing every power station built in the UK in
the past four years and it was in the course of a similar project in
Albania, where Earl has been advising the government on debt restructuring,
that the two parties met.
Earl's experience, while diverse, has not been with mainstream corporate
finance outfits. His own vehicle, Tranwood Earl, which is remembered for its
audacious but fruitless bids for the likes of Storehouse, collapsed in 1991.
For the past couple of years Earl has been working out of the US, following
a complicated deal in which he put The Carter Organization into, and then
rescued it from, Chapter 11. As well as his Albanian activities he has
recently been working on a communications project in Bolivia, the completion
of which he hopes to celebrate in May by ascending a 21,000 foot peak near
La Paz.
He says his wish to return to the UK is partly caused by a sense that there
is a revival of takeover activity. He believes his transatlantic experience
will be valuable and likes the idea of the US culture at Fieldstone. 'I've
trodden on a lot of toes because that is what the institutions wanted me to
do,' he adds, indirectly explaining why he might not fit so easily into a UK
merchant bank.
Earl is not being made a partner - there are none in London - but says he
'lives in hope'. He is bringing with him to Fieldstone three colleagues from
Tranwood days.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Business and the Environment: East counts cost of a dirty
legacy - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania face a big bill after 50 years of
Soviet army sloppiness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW KAMINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Soviet army may be withdrawing from eastern Europe but it has left
behind an ecological mess. The bill for the clean-up operation will be
staggering.
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are currently sizing up the fallout from 50
years of sloppiness at more than 1,000 former Soviet military facilities.
This legacy of Soviet rule, ranging from nuclear waste to water pollution,
should keep policy planners and eco-businesses busy for years.
Soviet pilots, for instance, would regularly dump jet fuel on the ground to
minimise flying hours. At the Tapa military air base in Estonia, 16 sq km
are polluted by jet fuel, 7m deep in some places.
At most Soviet airfields in the Baltic region - as in east Germany and the
Czech Republic - waste fuel, while not toxic, has seeped into the region's
shallow natural groundwater reserves and raised purification costs.
The World Bank has examined the damage at Latvia's Tukums air force base,
and is considering funding clean-up programmes. Environment Canada, a
government agency, has offered to train Latvians in site remediation and
assessment. But institutional lenders have yet to commit substantial funds
to clean-up efforts.
Meanwhile Baltec, a private Latvian company, has begun a bioremediation
project at Tukums. Over five years, it plans to pump out the jet fuel, some
of which can be salvaged and resold, and put bacteria into the soil to break
down the remaining fuel.
Inspectors previously barred from secret sites are finding other and more
worrying surprises. Near Zvarde, an eastern Latvian town, more than 24,000
ha of farmland were confiscated for air target practice. The land was
returned to Latvia after independence, leaving a trail of pollution,
deforestation and unexploded bombs after 30 years of daily bombing sorties.
Peteris Elfers, a member of parliament, estimates that demining might take
another 30 years. 'It has to be done,' he says, 'but we don't have the
technology to do it well.' An inspection last summer found 364 bombs, mines
and rockets after examining just the main bombing polygon of 159 ha - and
only cursorily to a depth of 20 cm.
Deadly waste understandably raises more eyebrows. In Sillamae, a closed
military city on Estonia's north-eastern coast, a classified chemical
combine has left a 20m-high dam that contains, according to Murray Feshbach,
an expert on the Soviet environment at Georgetown University in the US, 4m
tonnes of uranium ore, 1,200 tonnes of pure uranium, 1,000 tonnes of radium,
800 tonnes of thorium, plus 2m tonnes of calcium sulphide oil shale ash and
some ground radioactivity.
In a big storm, this could go into the nearby Gulf of Finland and directly
affect the Baltic rim countries. Feshbach says one safety measure, so far
not carried out, would be to encase the dam in cement.
Nuclear waste pockets have also been discovered across the Baltic
hinterlands. Last summer in Lithuania, radioactive equipment dumped at a
landfill in Zokniai, an airfield near Siulinae, produced alarming geiger
readings.
Paldiski, a big submarine base in Estonia, has two nuclear reactors, a
depository for liquid waste, another for solid waste and underground
pipelines for radioactive sewage. In troop withdrawal talks, Russia has
agreed to give up the base, remove the nuclear fuel rods and take care of
waste and the necessary clean-up. What should be done with the 600 tonnes of
liquid waste and the two reactors is unclear.
Estonia, which has a fiercely nationalistic government, worries about the
proposed length of a Russian clean-up presence until 2000. It may look west
for help instead, says Alar Olljum, a foreign ministry spokesman.
But Feshbach worries more about dimethylhydrazine, also called heptyl, a
liquid rocket fuel that is supertoxic, volatile, carcinogenic and nerve
paralysing. Around 270 tonnes - of the estimated 150,000 tonnes in the
former Soviet Union - have been found around Ventspils, a large Latvian port
city. 'There is no known technology to get rid of it,' says Feshbach. 'The
cheapest way is to fire it from rockets.'
However, Harry Whitacker, chief of emergency engineering at Environment
Canada, hopes heptyl can be turned into ammonia or methanol by using
ultraviolet light and peroxide in an advanced oxidation process; and nitric
acid, once pumped to the surface, could be converted to fertiliser if mixed
with ammonium and hydroxide.
On the Baltic Sea shore, military harbours have been left in a pitiable
state. At Liepaja, a top Soviet Baltic Fleet base, the harbour floor,
polluted by heavy metals and crude oil a metre deep, needs to be dredged.
Just off the coast sit sunken battleship hulls, stripped of non-ferrous
iron. Nearby are submarines which used batteries leaving semi-toxic residue
 -potentially dangerous if built up over time. Clean-up would be expensive,
but a World Bank official says the spectacular site of pilfered Soviet
warships might be a profitable tourist site.
The bank has made the conversion of Liepaja from a military into a
commercial centre a priority project in the belief that the city's large
port could be a key trans-shipment point to and from the Russian market. The
bank has obtained the Latvian government's commitment to support a project
of water treatment, coastal management and tourism. Environment Canada would
handle the military pollution.
Like any economically depressed nation, however, Latvia must make hard
choices on pollution clean-up. A clear economic incentive is needed to
secure funding.
Symbolic cost estimates have been presented to Russia, the inheritor of the
Soviet army. Latvia has sent Moscow a Dollars 147m (Pounds 99m) bill for
land use and anticipated clean-up. Realistically, however, the Balts do not
expect Russia to pay.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Management: Twelve steps to a successful speech - Talking
about the audience you are talking to is the key to public speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WALTER BRUDERER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Who are these people?' If you are preparing to make a speech, and the
audience is already shaking your confidence, start with that question. It is
the key to public-speaking success.
Whether they are strangers or co-workers, they have one thing in common:
they expect you to dazzle them for the next 15 or 20 minutes. And the best
way is to focus on their favourite subject - themselves. Talk about the
people you are talking to.
Begin by defining who these people are and what they want. To help, here are
12 questions:
Are these people friends, co-workers, customers or strangers? Define their
characteristics and self-interests - the work they do, their education
level, the everyday language they use, and especially the problems and
opportunities that concern them.
Why are they here? What do they expect to get out of your speech? What do
they want of you? They expect to benefit somehow. Write these expectations
down.
Why were you invited to make this speech? There must be something special
about your background that is of interest to the audience. What exactly have
you got to offer? You must understand your qualifications so you can deliver
the speech they expect to hear. Audiences are easily disappointed when a
speaker steps out of character and ignores the reason he was chosen.
What problems do these people have? One of the best ways to win approval
from your audience is to recognise their problems and help solve them. Your
knowledge of their problems is probably the reason you were invited to
speak. They expect fresh insights, a different point of view, and ideas that
may help them. They do not want platitudes and generalities. One or two
specific ideas that stir their minds will send them away feeling their time
has been well spent.
What opportunities do they have and how can you help realise them? This and
problem-solving are the two best strategies to catch and hold the attention
of any audience. Your function is to help them see their opportunities, open
their eyes, stimulate their imagination, point the direction, and encourage
them to act. They came to this meeting expecting you to freshen and expand
their thinking.
What is the normal, everyday language of this audience? Once you have
settled on the big theme idea, the ultimate virtue is to express it with
absolute clarity. If your audience is from a certain industry, what
terminology does it understand best? The audience dictates your choice of
words. The best way to convey an idea is to use the language the audience
knows best, cast in the simplest words you can find.
Do these people like humour? Everybody does. But humour is a risky device.
What strikes one listener as clever may strike another as inane. The theme
of your meeting may be serious, and humour would be out of place. Few
speakers are good comic story-tellers, and nothing can be worse than telling
an old, inappropriate or pointless story. A light touch here and there, if
it does not interrupt the logic of your speech, is welcome, but humour is no
substitute for a big, useful idea clearly expressed.
How long should the speech be? When you were invited, you were probably
given a general time limit. The best rule is to take only as much time as
needed to make your presentation with absolute clarity. The only thing worse
than being too long and boring is being too short and only partially
understood.
Should you use visual aids? If they make your central point easier to
comprehend, yes. Keep them simple and uncomplicated because the audience has
only a moment or two to digest them. Explain every word, line, graph,
number, picture; otherwise, if you pass on without doing so, the audience
feels it has missed something.
What should your manner of speaking be? Speak loudly. Make sure your voice
carries distinctly to the farthest listener, so nobody has to strain to hear
you. The whole character of your speech - your enthusiasm, conviction,
emphasis, sincerity - can be lost if you speak with a tentative, soft voice
that makes listening a chore. Nobody ignores a loud voice, and there is no
conviction in a voice that mumbles.
How should you use your eyes? Make eye contact. Look directly into the eyes
of individuals, shifting from one part of the audience to another, from
front to back, left to right. This has the compelling effect of keeping
listeners' eyes on the speaker, feeling that he is addressing them
personally. It also makes you, the speaker, feel you have made personal
contact with individuals who are hanging on every word.
Should you make an outline? Yes, and consult it as you speak. It forces you
to organise your speech in a logical, coherent way, and keeps you from
running off the track.
These questions are just a start; add others to fit your occasion. Taking a
few minutes to understand who these people are, and what they want, is the
first step in making a good speech.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Management: At home in the office - How telecommunications
companies have used technology to transform their workplaces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SANTA RAYMOND and ROGER CUNLIFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Telecommunications and information technology companies have long argued
that technology is an important tool in workplace design. What is less well
known is that many of them practise what they preach.
Companies such as IBM, Digital Equipment, British Telecommunications and
Mercury understand the full potential of modern technology, and apply it in
their workplaces in a way that offers lessons for others.
IBM has a tradition of excellent offices, but its Smart (space, morale and
remote technology) programme takes an innovative leap forward. At Bedfont
Lakes on the outskirts of London, IBM has divided individual workspaces into
four types: managers' offices, permanent workstations for administrative
staff, grouped and shared 'hot desks' for mobile consultants, and 'touchdown
desks' for other staff visiting the office for brief periods.
Consultants are encouraged to be where the work is: at the clients'
premises. When back at base (conventionally less than 40 per cent of the
working year), their 'hot desking' more than doubles the utilisation of desk
space. This cuts the amount of space needed, even when offset by an increase
in meeting rooms and rooms set aside for customers to work in.
The other main space saver is IBM's policy of grouping all filing, both team
and personal. Files are taken to desks in portable trays, personal filing is
minimised and desks are kept clear. The results of these and other measures,
says project manager Harvey Young, are more effective operations and a 25
per cent saving in space.
At Mercury Telecommunications the challenge is growth and change with
'awesome velocity', in the words of Chris Ridgewell of its Flexible Working
Applications Group, which advises customers on IT packages for workplaces.
When architects Austin-Smith Lord designed the interior of Mercury's London
headquarters, stress was put on flexibility; in particular, the IT
installation has a floor outlet point every 4 sq m, more than twice the
usual density. Yet with an organisation growing at 100 people a month,
technological flexibility and the acquisition of space are not enough.
The answer is 'virtual teams': people collaborating closely, but in a range
of locations. They may work from home, in the car, at a customer's office,
at 'third-party sites', in a branch office of Mercury, or at head office -
yet they work as a unified team. They are united by a strong sense of
'mission', highly sophisticated IT, skilled team co-ordinators - and a base
office that provides the right environment for anything from a 'touch-down'
visit to a full team brainstorming.
What sort of a physical environment makes a base office attractive,
welcoming and stimulating? At Digital Equipment's Stockholm office, a
virtual team was asked to decide this for itself. The result is a flexibly
planned area with consultants sitting in lounge chairs under an artificial
tree, their mobile filing trolleys beside them. At the press of a button
their computer terminals descend from the branches to a convenient height.
In the corner a raised cafe area is also used for informal meetings. The
general decor has hints of the golf course, the beach and the garden: all
places where the team said they felt at their most creative. The team
co-ordinators (executive secretaries) also work on a dais, giving them
eye-level contact with standing colleagues, a view in-the-round of what is
going on, and emphasising the importance of their role.
Idealistic? Lavish? Not if you take into account a 50 per cent saving in
space and a 20 per cent increase in productivity. The pilot area for 14
people has now been expanded to cater for 200.
BT's carefully monitored experiment with its directory inquiries staff in
Scotland is another approach to the virtual team: the static relocation of
some members of an in-house work group.
In BT's case 11 staff were detached from the Inverness office and set up to
work in their own homes. As well as telecommunications and information
technology, or 'telematics' (which included video links with each other and
with Inverness), BT developed special furniture, which was robust enough for
work use yet domestic in scale. It also considered the broader implications
of home-working - such as interruptions, security and child-proof equipment.
With the psychology department of Aberdeen University, BT is now evaluating
the year-long experiment. The initial reaction of the workers and their
families was very positive. The findings - some already published - are not
only for BT to use in its staff deployment, but to help its customers
contemplating home-working.
What does all this mean for the design of tomorrow's offices? Creative
change is essential if businesses are to survive pressures from new
technology, from globalisation, from demographic and educational changes in
the workforce, from concerns about the costs of commuting and its
environmental impact - and changing lifestyles.
The workplaces of these four companies show the way. For all their
technological sophistication, what is evident is the humanity; a concern
with the quality of working life. They show that offices are increasingly
becoming:
Meeting places as much as workplaces, places for group interaction rather
than solitary concentration;
Pleasant places, which attract and retain the shrinking number of new
graduates joining the ranks of skilled knowledge workers;
Flexible places, far more space-efficient and adaptable, reducing both
capital and running costs;
Humane places, often smaller and nearer home (or even at it) but still part
of a global communications network.

escape the doldrums?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAINING
Denis MacShane, director of communications, International Metalworkers
Federation:
'Measures to provide workers with constant skilling and reskilling should
not just be supported. They should be demanded as a right. People should get
involved in consultations and information exchanges within their companies.
We should learn from the Japanese system where you are thought of as a
member of a company, not just as an employee - this helps limit
unemployment. I favour reductions in working time, which is out of kilter
with what is needed to produce goods and services in Europe. Employees
should support policies aimed at producing new products. In 10 or 15 years,
ordinary people as they grow older will have several thousand pounds worth
of health diagnostic equipment at home.'
SINGLE MARKET
Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz - secretary general, Unice (European employers
federation):
'If you project today's trends in Europe to 2000, the result is dismal. It
can't be allowed to happen. We have been divided up into little national
states, each one protecting what he does, each with its own airline, steel
industry and so on. We have missed out on the economies of scale.
We have the sees of recovery in the single market, but it's not properly
working yet.
'We need to tackle the problem of rising social security budgets, by
bringing in funded pensions. Our education systems need to produce people
who can adapt to high technology. The world recession won't last for ever.
When the upturn comes, it won't solve unemployment problems, but it will
give us the confidence to make difficult decisions.'
OPERATING GLOBALLY
Sir Anthony Cleaver, chairman of IBM UK, head of an inquiry on
competitiveness by Britain's Royal Sociey for the encouragement of Arts,
Manufactures and Commerce:
'During the next 10 years, it is inevitable that Europe's share of world
income will drop. It ought not to mean actual standards of living will
decline. However, we will have to reorganise social security. Just as,
inside companies, people look to their own careers and plan for themselves,
we are going to have to develop an increasing number of instruments to allow
individuals to take responsibilty for their future welfare.
'For businesses to prosper, there is no substitute for bright people with an
understanding of the industries they work in. In any high-tech area, you
have to keep abreast of what is happening and where advances are being made.
'
EUROPE'S PLACE IN THE WORLD
Prof. Michael Sturmer, director, Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (German
government foreign policy think-tank):
'We shouldn't be so afraid of south-east Asia. In the long run, these
countries could get into deep trouble. The streams of weapons flowing there
will sooner or later explode. Their passage is by no means assured. They
have to deal with North Korea, and they may get into deep water with China.
'Europe is still one of the best places in the world to live in. We will
recover. Our recession in Europe is a matter of the last 2 1/2 years. We
should not extrapolate to 2005. Our problem is the excessive welfare state.
But, throughout history, Europeans have shown enormous resilience. And,
unlike after the second world war, we are starting out from a very high
level.'
SCIENCE
Dr Bob Whelan, chief executive of the UK Centre for Exploitation of Science
and Technology:
'Because it is inadequately prepared for change, Europe too often follows
rather than sets the world agenda for new products. The European workforce
must become more flexible and adaptable. If you never stop learning, you can
learn new tricks.
'Europe must recognise the need for world class performance in ALL aspects
of industries that force that pace of technology - information,
pharmaceuticals, automotive, energy and so on.
'There is too much introverted concern that the EU is the market. Companies
should show more interest in global markets, looking for new opportunities -
and learning from high quality customers elsewhere in the world. Companies
must to hunt in packs. There is still great scope for new collaborations.'
EMPLOYMENT
Padraig Flynn, European Commissioner for employment:
'If the EU can get down to a 5 per cent unemployment rate by the end of the
century - half the present level - we could live with that. Governments must
avoid simply standing still and waiting for a cyclical upturn to solve our
difficulties. Even if we increase our competitiveness, that will not
automatically lead to more jobs. We need to increase the employment
intensity of growth.
'Cutting wages is not the answer, although we need moderate wage rises not
exceeding increases in productivity. We must lower burdens on employers
caused by high non-wage costs.
'We need to look at new types of work: part-time work and lower-paid jobs,
at a fair wage and with reasonable social protection. Low-paid work can be a
source of a lot of comfort.
REDESIGNING COMPANIES
Peter Kraljic, managing director, McKinsey management consultants, Paris:
'Cutting costs alone is not enough - if companies simply restructure
downwards, Europe will just run into ever higher unemployment. Companies
have to be redesigned for growth. Manufacturing techniques and the location
of manufacturing are less important than people's attitudes and state of
mind.
'For 40 years we have had growth in Europe. Now we are like the US at the
start of the 1980s.
'Europe has to exploit its strengths. We have a large market, and an
incredible mix of nations with incredible talents. If we have the will to be
Number One, at an individual, corporate and national level, we can do it.
But we cannot expect a miracle overnight. It will require coherent action
and a lot of leadership.'
WIDENING EUROPE
Bela Kadar, minister for international economic affairs, Hungary
'Hungarian membership of the EU by the 2000 is realistic. We will bring a
dowry - not just the Hungarian market, but the flows of trade and technology
with the rest of eastern Europe. If they invest in Hungary, western
companies can increase their competitiveness. If obstacles to our exports
fade, Hungarian and foreign investors can produce not just for 10.5m
Hungarians, but for 400m European consumers.'

FT  09 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Rivalries to the rescue in the search
for lost creativity - Diversity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Italy for 30 years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder,
bloodshed - they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and the
Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love, 500 years of democracy
and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock.' - Orson Welles in
The Third Man.
The historical detail is flawed. The Swiss have fought two civil wars since
the 16th century and did not invent the cuckoo clock. But Welles' monologue,
ad-libbed amid the ruins of 1940s Vienna, contains a poetic truth. Conflict
is a powerful spur to creativity. And diversity is the mother of conflict.
If Europe has a genius, a single defining characteristic, it is diversity.
In no other region is such intense intellectual, cultural and linguistic
variety packed into so small an area. Nowhere has the destiny of so many
nations been more powerfully shaped by continuous rivalry between them.
In some eyes, this is a debilitating heritage. It has, after all, exacted a
cruel price over the centuries in recurrent wars. Now that national
advantage is furthered more by economic than military means, it is
fashionable to decry Europe's heterogeneous structure as a handicap in the
face of the relative homogeneity of Japan and the US.
Has not Japan's economic success been based heavily on management by
consensus and a widely shared sense of national purpose? Has Hollywood not
conquered the world because of the scale economies available from its large
and integrated home market? Surely, logic requires European industry to
respond by closing ranks and presenting a united front to the world?
Such analyses, however, miss the point. At a time when technology and
liberalisation are forcing open markets worldwide, the toughest corporate
challenge is not to achieve global production scale, but to differentiate
products and services and tailor them precisely to widely varying local
demand.
In theory, these trends should work in Europe's favour. First, because
restricted home markets have long compelled ambitious producers to look
beyond their own borders. For many, learning to adapt to unfamiliar
conditions, and incorporating the lessons into their own operations, has
been a prerequisite of expansion.
Secondly, because many of Europe's enduring industrial successes have been
built on intensive specialisation and continuous striving to create and
enhance distinctive competitive capabilities. This is the story of German
capital goods, Swiss precision engineering, Italian luxury products, French
fashion and British pharmaceuticals.
The point was well understood by the authors of the single market programme.
Their intention was never to create a uniformly level playing field
dominated by equally matched industrial monoliths. Rather, by unleashing
fiercer cross-border competition, they aimed to promote specialisation by
freeing resources to flow to where they were most efficiently employed.
But the vision is still far from realisation. European countries continue to
cling to the notion that sovereignty requires a presence in a broad swathe
of industries, almost regardless of the cost.
For all the talk of EU integration, governments obstinately defend the right
of national steel producers to continue losing money and of sleepy
telecommunications monopolies and flagship airlines to charge high prices
for mediocre service.
Nor is such nationalism limited to bigger countries. It was clearly at work
in the decision last year by Swedish shareholders to torpedo the
Renault-Volvo marriage and in the collapse of Alcazar, the planned merger of
Austrian, Dutch, Swiss and Scandinavian airlines.
The result is not simply diminished efficiency, but the duplication across
Europe of largely undifferentiated structures in many industries. Instead of
breeding healthy diversity and creativity, national rivalry has perversely
produced sameness and common weaknesses.
In these circumstances, preserving existing structures wholesale is not
evidence of an ability to compete, but of a refusal to do so. The real test
will be how effectively European economies enhance comparative advantage by
abandoning poor performers and concentrating resources on those activities
which they do best.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Balance of economic power begins to
shift - David Marsh sees opportunities in Europe's lagging performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europeans are no strangers to periods of lagging economic performance. The
fortunes of ancient Egypt waxed and waned over 2,000 years, while most of
Europe was a barbaric wilderness populated by goatherds.
The cycles of world history have since accelerated and become
interconnected, to a degree barely conceivable even a generation ago. As it
tackles the problem of fading dynamism, Europe must weather a phase of
unsettling political and economic transition.
'Europe can be under no illusion that it faces very strong competition from
the US and Asia,' says Mr Ernst-Antoine Selliere, vice-president in charge
of economic affairs at the French Patronat employers' organisation. 'But,
provided we loosen constraints on our competitiveness, this can be an
opportunity.'
The European nations that launched the manufacturing revolutions of the 18th
and 19th centuries ceded industrial leadership to the US after the first
world war. Now, as a result of global upheavals in technology and
communications, another shift in the balance of economic power may be
imminent - this time, towards the rapidly expanding economies of the Pacific
Rim.
Using World Bank data and its own assumptions about future growth, Union
Bank of Switzerland (UBS) projects that, in the first decade of next
century, purchasing power income per head in Singapore and Korea will exceed
that of the US. Incomes in Singapore are already close to the west European
average.
According to similarly derived projections by UK accountants Coopers and
Lybrand, the share of world GDP taken by Asian developing countries
(including both China and India) could rise to 28 per cent in 2010 from 18
per cent in 1990. Western Europe's share would fall to 17 per cent from 22
per cent, while the US's would fall to 18 per cent from 23 per cent.
This projection assumes annual growth in both western Europe and the US of
2.5 per cent, against 6 per cent in Asia. Even if the growth differential is
less, Europe will drop down the economic rankings. But Europe's likely
decline needs to be put into perspective.
First, it is natural that less well-off countries move closer to wealthy
ones. Over the past 20 years, the gulf between many rich and poor countries
has widened. Where gaps have narrowed, they normally remain large. According
to World Bank figures (based on constant dollar exchange rates rather than
purchasing power parities), by 2000 the ratio between average GDP per capita
in western Europe and east Asia will be an 18 to 1, compared with 48 to 1 in
1970.
Second, as living standards rise in less developed countries, wealth should
flow back to Europe through increased trade and investment. Provided
European companies match international advances in management and
technology, Europe can maintain a strong competitive advantage in goods and
services the rest of the world wants. This requires that borders remain open
and protectionist pressure is resisted.
Professor Richard Portes, director of the London-based Centre for Economic
Policy Research, believes a narrowing of the wealth gap between Europe and
the rest of the world need not be disastrous. 'I'm very sceptical about the
views of the doomsayers.'
Differences in real wages between western Europe and other manufacturing
regions will narrow, he says, in the same way that US wages, relative to
those in Europe, have fallen since the 1950s. This need not stop European
living standards rising.
According to UBS's projections, western Europe's growth rate will pick up
early in the 21st century, as the continent benefits from the 'catch up'
phenomenon, under which countries that lag adopt innovations from the
leaders.
A striking example of 'catch up' has been US success in the 1980s in
reacting to the competitive threat from Japan by importing 'just-in-time'
Japanese production technology, says Mr Bill Gasser, UBS's senior
international economist.
But, as it tries to adapt, Europe has one big disadvantage. The
fast-increasing share of GDP taken by government spending in the past decade
 -a rise well under way before the onset of the European recession in
1992-93 - has imposed a growing burden on business.
Social spending is the biggest single portion of these outlays. The OECD
says social security transfers in the EU will account for 21.5 per cent of
GDP in 1994, up from 16.4 per cent in 1989 - double the percentage rise in
the last downturn in 1979-1982. In relation to GDP, EU social transfers
exceed US and Japanese levels by 50 per cent and 78 per cent.
As a community of nation states, western Europe faces greater difficulties
than the US did a decade ago in adopting common policies to recover
dynamism. But Europe's diversity is also a trump card. Different parts of
the continent can draw upon varying strengths and specialisations.
There is little disagreement on the diagnosis of Europe's core problems. The
task is to implement corrective measures:
Growth of public spending on welfare is placing intolerable strains on
budget deficits - one reason for high taxes and interest rates. Beyond
simply cutting benefits, governments need a new balance between public and
private sector social security provision.
The number of old people in Europe could outstrip resources to care for
them. Imaginative solutions will be required, returning the elderly to
family environments and using technological advances to moderate medical
costs.
More flexible labour markets are needed, including improved possibilities
for part-time work and less rigid wage-bargaining mechanisms. The collapse
in demand for unskilled labour creates the potential for an integrated tax
and welfare system allowing low-paid workers to be paid partly by employers
and partly by tax credits.
Europe must overcome its technological lag. Companies at the forefront of
scientific advance must improve links both to the markets they serve and the
education establishments on which they draw. Europe needs a better balance
between the costs and benefits of environmental regulation. Environmental
rules have not yet been a significant spur to innovation or competitive
advantage. Plans for further integration, including widening (early next
century) to central and eastern Europe, need to be based on liberal,
open-market principles.
Governments know Europe can prosper only if companies think globally. This
can lead to some sharp modifications. Pointing to the large number of German
companies shifting production abroad to escape high domestic costs, Mr
Ludolf von Wartenberg, general manager of the Federation of German Industry,
says companies are moving away from a 'Made in Germany' towards a 'Designed
in Germany' concept. German industry will regain competitiveness, he says.
But he admits doubts on how German society will cope with the strain.
This type of corporate reaction can be painful, but the absence of
adjustment would have still more disturbing consequences. If European
enterprises and employees can muster the flexibility to manage change and
the flair to master it, salvation is assured.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Recruitment: Pegs in round holes need not be square -
Performance targeting and appraisal is stifling innovation in the
marketplace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stories that cast doubts on the value of the most thorough processes of
recruitment should be treated with caution, but they are very tempting to
relate nevertheless. This one I am told is true and I have a name for the
man involved, Dante Montalbetti, a former head of Eurobond trading in the UK
at Merrill Lynch, the US securities house.
The story goes that, impressed by his mental agility at calculating the
weekly quota, Montalbetti hired a milkman to work as a trader around the
time of Big Bang in the mid 1980s. The milkman enthusiastically swapped his
electric milk float and a modest wage for a telephone-digit salary and a
Porsche. Then came the 1987 crash and he was made redundant in one of the
clear-outs. Today he has returned to his Surrey milk round where the only
traded options are whether his customers order one pint or two.
The story sounds too good to be true and certainly Merrill Lynch was unable
to provide any supporting evidence, so it may have to be discarded into the
apocryphal bin. But what is to be learned from it anyway? Does it mean that
milkmen make good bond traders or that bond traders make good milkmen?
Its main point here is to demonstrate that there will always be cases of the
individual whose career path has wavered from conventional routes. Surely
this reflects the diversity of backgrounds that many employers would wish to
encourage. Not so, apparently. A contributor at a recent business forum
spoke of an Oxford college tutor seeking placements for four of his
graduates taking degrees in music, history, Latin and geography. The
qualifications were dismissed as useless by a company recruiter who was only
interested in business studies degrees.
Such attitudes are not unique. Further evidence of a polarity of approach
was volunteered by a headhunter who said that one securities company in the
US designed a psychometric test to search for the principal personality
traits exhibited by its most successful trader. The very idea of such
vocational cloning might seem like kindling for a bonfire of vanities to
some but it has attracted interest, particularly in sales areas.
Less finely tailored selective recruitment procedures, using structured
interviews instead of pencil and paper tests to sift out desired personality
traits, are available and used in the UK. B&amp;Q, the UK do-it-yourself chain
has started using them and Joshua Tetley, the Leeds brewer, has used them in
its selection of public house managers.
The kind of structured interviews that can find successful sales people can
also single out innovators, says Terry Lunn, managing director of Talent
Plus (UK), a company that administers structured interviews. But some
occupational psychologists believe that creative people are being neglected
by recruiters and managers.
A new report from the British Psychological Society says that if we really
want innovators in our organisations, we are going the wrong way about
encouraging them. The authors say that modern performance-orientated
incentives threaten to suffocate the individuality and creativeness which
once made British industry the envy of the world.
Kay's Flying shuttle, Arkwright's loom, Hargreaves' Spinning Jenny and
Crompton's mule all played their part in revolutionising the textile
industry upon which much of the UK's 19th century wealth was founded. Where
are their equivalents now and would we value them in our workplaces if we
could find them?
Michael West, an occupational psychologist at Sheffield University and one
of the report's authors, believes that innovators today are getting a raw
deal. In many organisations their potential is stifled by performance
appraisal and targeting, he argues. They need to be identified, nurtured,
and given the time and space they need to make things happen.
He points to 3M, which gives each of its research and development staff the
option to spend 15 per cent of their time at work to use as they wish in
their own projects and experiments. This may help account for the fact that
30 per cent of the company's turnover is from products introduced in the
last four years. 'If the project fails then their job is not on the line,'
said West.
With co-authors Professor Clive Fletcher, of Goldsmith's College, University
of London, and John Toplis of the Post office training and development
group, West has written a paper entitled 'Fostering Innovation'*, demanding
greater emphasis on identifying and encouraging innovators.
It is true, say the authors, that innovators can be unconventional people,
unattracted by routine work requiring attention to detail. Their thinking
may challenge orthodoxy, threaten general managers and be impractical.
'However, organisations also have to recognise that the complete exclusion
of such people could lead to stagnation,' they warn.
Much of their argument reflects a growing dissatisfaction among many
employers with performance-related pay. Up to now one of the main objections
to PRP has been that it is divisive. Some have argued additionally that it
can be demotivating. This new paper goes further, suggesting that it can
actually stultify the natural creativity of individuals.
Fletcher says: 'When you look at all those companies in the private sector
which have gone through downsizing and de-layering and introduced
performance management practices, performance-related pay and appraisal
systems, it has led to leaner fitter organisations . . . The cost has been
to their capacity to innovate.'
'As you make increased demands on each individual the pressure increases and
it becomes difficult to get the time to reflect on what you are doing.'
The trend in many organisations, he argues, has been to place too strong an
emphasis on short-term business goals that provide the reward, with
redundancy or dismissal often the price of failure.
Fletcher suggests that too much emphasis on PRP tends to shift people's
focus away from the task and on to the money they receive for its
accomplishment. 'A manager of a clearing bank told me: 'People here never
used to think about money. Now they think of nothing else.''
'People need to be encouraged to feel confident. Managements should get rid
of PRP. It has not been an effective motivator. We have to start rewarding
innovation and put it on the agenda.' Fletcher's comments would suggest that
while performance-related pay is by no means dead as a form of reward, it is
clear that some are already digging its grave.
The report also seeks to promote the potential of teams built of diverse
skills. It draws on a footballing analogy to make the point that a team will
be ineffective if comprised solely of attacking players or conversely of
defensive players. It needs a balance. This same observation has been made
during a research programme at Roffey Park Management Institute focusing on
the management of creative individuals in areas like music, theatre, sport,
and corporate research and development.
Joanna Howard, director of research notes that while the idiosyncrasies and
insecurities of creative people can be taxing on managers, the reward in
terms of innovation for those that persevere can be incalculable. But she
also warns that matching their abilities with equally spectacular financial
rewards is not necessarily motivating. 'Putting extrinsic rewards to things
that people do for their intrinsic love of it can be terribly damaging,' she
says.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Domestic holidays lose out to foreign trips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British went on a record 56m holidays last year but the proportion taken
in the UK fell to its lowest level ever, the British Tourist Authority said
yesterday.
British residents took 32.5m holidays of four nights or more in the UK last
year, 1.6 per cent up on 1992. But the number of foreign holidays increased
by 8 per cent to 23.5m. The share of holidays taken in the UK was 58 per
cent, compared with 60 per cent in 1992.
The number of domestic holidays taken rose from 31.5m in 1960 to more than
40m in the mid-1970s, before falling to 28.5m in 1987.
Over the same period there has been a sharp increase in the number of
holidays taken abroad. In 1960, only 3.5m Britons took their holidays
abroad. By 1980 the number had reached 12m.
While more Britons go abroad, a record number of foreign tourists have
visited the UK. The Central Statistical Office said last week that the
number of overseas visits to the UK rose 4 per cent to 19.3m last year.
However, the increase in the number of Britons going abroad resulted in a
rise in the travel account deficit of the balance of payments to Pounds
3.7bn last year, compared with Pounds 3.4bn in 1992.
Ms Adele Biss, BTA chairman, said yesterday: 'Our tourism industry cannot
survive on growth from overseas visitors alone. Nor can we expect cut-throat
competition from package holidays to disappear.'
She added that the UK tourist industry needed 'more focus on quality
standards, value for money, more energetic promotion and better marketing.
This is not by any means an impossible task. But we need greater commitment
from government and the industry, working in partnership, to arrest this
decline.'

FT  09 MAR 94 / Incapacity bill gains majority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bill aimed at ending abuse of invalidity benefit by introducing a new
incapacity benefit from April next year was given a third reading by a
majority of 26 (302-276) in the Commons last night.
Charges by Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs that it would penalise people
genuinely unfit for work were denied by Mr Nicholas Scott, minister for the
disabled.
A more objective medical test, which is still the subject of consultation,
will determine eligibility. The benefit, which will be taxed, will be
payable from the first day of incapacity for those who do not qualify for
statutory sick pay.
Mr Scott confirmed that existing invalidity benefit claimants would not
suffer financial loss through moving to the new benefit. 'There will be no
cash losers at the point of change,' he said.
Mr Scott said expenditure on invalidity benefit had increased from Pounds
2.4bn in 1979 to Pounds 6.1bn in 1992-93. While expenditure would continue
to grow under the arrangements authorised by the bill, it would be more
clearly focused on the long-term sick.
Mr Keith Bradley, a shadow junior social security minister, emphasised
Labour's 'root and branch' opposition to the bill and looked to the House of
Lords to make substantial amendments.
Mr Jim Wallace, for the Liberal Democrats, feared the medical test would be
'mechanistic' and result in people being deemed to be capable of work when
there was little prospect of them finding any.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Abu Dhabi improves BCCI offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The liquidators to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International
yesterday provisionally approved a revised deal with the government of Abu
Dhabi which should pave the way for an increased payment to creditors.
Under the terms of the settlement, Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder in
the bank, is expected to increase its direct cash contribution to about
Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 1.23bn). It had previously agreed a payment of at
least Dollars 1.2bn.
The agreement requires the ratification of the BCCI creditors committee,
which failed to meet formally yesterday following a dispute over the
confidentiality by which its members are bound.
The money available under the agreement for distribution to the bank's
hundreds of thousands of creditors around the world will be raised further
as a result of the settlement because Abu Dhabi has agreed to restructure
and reduce a number of its claims against BCCI. It is expected to drop its
potential claim for Dollars 2.2bn of assets it alleges were stolen by the
bank, and in exchange may receive protection from future litigation which
could be brought against it by the liquidators.
Efforts to reach a new deal have been under way since October, when the
Luxembourg appeal court rejected on technical grounds a previous settlement
between the liquidators and Abu Dhabi.
The new agreement has been modified to address these problems and has been
considerably simplified in an effort to achieve an easier and speedier
settlement for creditors.
If the creditors committee ratifies the agreement, it will still require
approval by the English, Cayman Islands and Luxembourg courts, which may
delay a first payment for several months. The liquidators have never revised
their original estimated payments of 30p to 40p in the pound.
The liquidators from Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, yesterday promised a
briefing with 'an important announcement about compensation for creditors'
but then cancelled it following the unexpected way in which discussions with
the creditors' committee developed.
The Abu Dhabi settlement was concluded after final negotiations with the
liquidators in Zurich last week. The government of Abu Dhabi indicated last
month that it was keen to see creditors receive increased compensation for
their losses.
Other money available to creditors will come from liquidation of BCCI's
assets, up to Dollars 150m paid by Abu Dhabi to the US authorities as
settlement of legal actions, and from any proceeds of litigation against the
bank's auditors, the Bank of England and National Commercial Bank of Saudi
Arabia.
If an agreement had not been reached the liquidators would have had to
consider suing Abu Dhabi, which risked jeopardising any payouts for many
years.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Germans aim to lift British purchases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Daimler-Benz has set up a subsidiary to co-ordinate plans for increasing
component purchases in the UK.
The group, which includes truck and carmaker Mercedes Benz, AEG and Deutsche
Aerospace, says it is spending Pounds 200m a year in the UK.
The new company, Daimler-Benz Purchasing Co-ordination (UK), will be based
at Mercedes' headquarters in Milton Keynes.
The group says it intends to increase purchases made outside Germany - in
other countries as well as the UK - from 17 per cent to 25 per cent of
spending. This represents additional spending outside Germany of DM4bn, or
just more than Pounds 1.5bn.
Mr Peter Stangl, the new company's managing director, said: 'We want to make
even more use of the British procurement market. Prices are competitive and
standards are high, so there are many opportunities for suppliers.' New car
sales will exceed 2m this year for the first time since 1990, the motor
finance arm of National Westminster Bank said yesterday.
The forecast, by far the most optimistic from any industry source, was made
by Lombard Motor Finance.
About one in five of all new cars purchased by a finance arrangement goes
through Lombard.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Light van sales higher in February
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sales of light vans made their long-awaited upturn last month, broadening
the commercial-vehicle market recovery to every sector except buses, coaches
and utility four-wheel-drive vehicles.
In some areas of the market the sales surge last month reached spectacular
levels, with the important heavy trucks sector - over 15 tonnes - up 31.9
per cent compared with February last year.
Statistics from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show that
sales of light vans - mainly those derived from cars - rose 5.9 per cent, to
5,334 from 5,037, reversing a long declining trend.
Sales of larger panel vans, typified by the Ford Transit, were 14.8 per cent
higher last month than in the same period a year ago, at 7,040 from 6,133.
Leyland Daf, recovering from the former Daf group's term in receivership
early last year, said: 'The market has definitely turned. Dealers are
reporting many more inquiries being turned into orders and we're now seeing
fleet customers who we haven't talked to for a considerable time.' It is
increasing weekly output from 200 vans to 250.
The market for trucks - vehicles over 3.5 tonnes - was up 11.95 per cent
last month, the statistics show. Last month's 8.13 per cent rise in total
new commercial vehicle registrations, to 16,312 from 15,085 a year ago,
raised the total for the first two months of the year to 33,954, a 4.46 per
cent rise from 32,503 in the same period last year.
Imports continue to take a larger share. They rose to 42.57 per cent last
month compared with 40.95 per cent in the previous February, and to 42.62
per cent in the first two months compared with 39.89 per cent in the same
period last year.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Counties attacked over spending on publicity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ministers have fuelled the row over the English local government review by
attacking Essex and Surrey county councils for spending too much on
literature publicising their case.
Both counties responded that their spending was necessary to meet
requirements set by the Local Government Commission. They said district
councils, which Department of the Environment ministers excluded from
criticism, had spent far more.
Most district councils favour creating small, all-purpose unitary
authorities while counties prefer either the existing two-tier system of
counties and districts or the creation of large unitary authorities. All
councils are expected to make submissions to the commission by the end of
May.
Essex said it 'absolutely refuted' the charge. It said the county had still
not decided on a new structure to recommend to the commission, and had so
far spent only Pounds 10,000 on a consultation leaflet, of which 25,000
copies had been printed.
Surrey estimated its expenditure - incurred producing two leaflets and
commissioning a Harris poll of residents - at Pounds 20,000.
Mr Michael Jennings, deputy chief executive, said this had been incurred
under guidance from the commission. He estimated that the 11 Surrey district
councils had spent 'at least Pounds 100,000' on the review.
Each of them paid Pounds 7,500 to CSL, the managed services division of
accountants Touche Ross, to prepare financial estimates for their
submission, which calls for five or six unitary councils.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Sporting Bentley design unveiled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars yesterday surprised the Geneva motor show by
unveiling a concept study for a 'smaller' Bentley convertible and coupe.
The model, if it is put into production, could come close to doubling
production volumes by the end of the decade.
The Concept Java 'could set the scene for the next generation of sporting
Bentleys', the company said. Mr Peter Ward, chief executive of Rolls-Royce
Motor Cars, said the company would test the concept and customer views 'for
at least one more year'.
Development of the car would take four or five years, meaning that
production could start by the end of the 1990s. 'If we do it, we would aim
to have it in the market before the year 2000,' said Mr Ward.
He said the car could sell for Pounds 90,000 to Pounds 100,000, bringing it
into direct competition with luxury sports cars such as the Mercedes-Benz
600 SL. Current Rolls-Royce and Bentley models cost from Pounds 97,000 to
Pounds 175,000.
Mr Ward said research indicated that Bentley could sell 1,500 to 2,000 cars
a year in this market worldwide. The Java has been developed in a
collaboration between Rolls-Royce's design team and the Warwick-based Design
Research Associates headed by Mr Roy Axe, former chief designer of Rover.
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, a subsidiary of Vickers, the UK engineering and
defence group, has only recently returned to break-even after suffering
heavy losses in 1991 and 1992.
The technology for Java's 3.5-litre engine has been developed by Cosworth
Engineering, another Vickers subsidiary. A theoretical top speed of 170mph
would be electronically limited to 155mph.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Elderly's share of benefits falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The proportion of the social security budget going to elderly people is
falling, says the annual report of the Department of Social Security.
Four years ago, elderly people took up half of all benefits expenditure,
mainly through state pensions. By 1996-97 this will have fallen to less than
45 per cent of the total.
Over the same period, the share of social security going to long-term sick
and disabled people will rise from 16 per cent to 22 per cent. Legislation
to curb the growth in numbers claiming such benefits is passing through
parliament.
The report says that benefits have become better targeted in recent years,
with 95 per cent going to people in households with below-average income.
Since 1988 extra spending has been directed at low-income families with
children and pensioners receiving income support. Income-related benefits
are focused even more on low-income households. About 86 per cent goes to
those in the bottom 40 per cent of the income distribution.
However, more precise targeting has meant a small increase - to 845,000
households - in the numbers who lose more than 70 per cent of each
additional pound of income. This happens where the withdrawal of benefits
coincides with the start of income tax to produce high marginal net
deductions.
Spending on social security will account for 28 per cent of public spending
next year and will rise from Pounds 82bn this year to Pounds 92bn in
1996-97.
An increasing proportion of social security is financed out of general
taxation, which provides more than half the income for benefits. Employers'
National Insurance contributions provide a quarter of the budget and
employees' contributions about a fifth.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Banks may be held liable for pollution clean-ups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Banks could be held liable for cleaning up pollution caused by companies to
which they have made loans, under government proposals published yesterday.
The consultation paper from the Department of the Environment and the Welsh
Office suggests that a fund of millions of pounds might also be needed to
cover pollution costs where no person or organisation could be held liable.
But it stresses that the UK wants to avoid the problems faced by the US's
Superfund, which has seen clean-up costs outstripping its budget.
The report tackles questions about who should pay to clean up contaminated
land, and how clean it should be.
It recommends that land needs to be cleaned only to the extent of being
'suitable for use', not to its original state of cleanliness.
Ms Clare Deanesly of Gouldens, the solicitors, said yesterday: 'The question
that is really up in the air is liability for pollution that occurred in the
past. There has been a lot of buck-passing between the public and private
sectors.'
The legal problems were highlighted in December in a court battle between
Eastern Counties Leather and Cambridge Water over liability for water
pollution.
Last year the government scrapped plans for a register of contaminated land,
part of the 1990 Environmental Protection Act, because of fears that it
would cause property blight and would place too great a financial burden on
local authorities.
Ministers are concerned that the legal uncertainties are preventing
companies from securing loans and insurance, and making it preferable to
develop greenfield sites rather than old industrial blackspots.
The new proposals were attacked last night by banks, property companies and
environmentalists. Ms Hilary Thompson, head of the environmental unit at
National Westminster Bank, called for details of the banks' possible
exposure to be clarified.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said: 'Our disappointment is
that, after a year-long review, the government's recommendations remain so
tentative.'
Responses to the paper are due by May 3.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Government split over control of education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A split between the prime minister's office and the Department of Education
opened yesterday over future local government control of education.
Mr Graham Bright, parliamentary private secretary to Mr John Major, appeared
to tell his local county council in a letter that local government
re-organisation in England would mean the abolition of local education
authorities.
He said: 'I very much hope that Bedfordshire County Council will recognise
that the introduction of grant-maintained status for schools is permanent
and that its own imminent demise signals the end for local education
authorities.'
But the education department said that it had no plans to abolish local
education authorities 'in the lifetime of this parliament'. Local government
re-organisation is due to take place in 1995 and 1996, before the next
general election is due.
Education ministers have, however, strongly encouraged schools to opt out of
local authority control, and instead take their funding directly from
Whitehall.
Labour seized on Mr Bright's comments as an admission of a Tory 'hidden
agenda'. Education is a county responsibility in non-metropolitan England,
and counties are due to be split into smaller all-purpose authorities under
the government's guidance to the Local Government Commission. It had been
assumed that the new unitary councils would inherit responsibility for
education, the largest single item of local government spending.
County education officers oppose re-organisation, saying that it would
weaken services.
Mr Bright attacked 'the re-creation of the old local authority empire over
schools', saying this would favour 'the most hidebound vested interests in
education'.
Bedfordshire, which has no overall political control, said that 13 of the
county's schools had opted out, while 277 remained in county control. It
added that Mr Bright appeared to have prejudged the outcome of the review,
which could still, under government guidelines, recommend that the two-tier
system continue.
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said the comments were 'a
mixture of admission of the government's hidden agenda, and a sign of
desperation that the grant-maintained schools are not catching on in
anything like the way the government intended'.
She added that the practical problems of abolishing local education
authorities would be too great, as the government would not be able to run
schools in the country.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Prisoners involved in benefits fraud to be traced
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Steps are being taken to trace prisoners involved in an alleged
multi-million pound benefits fraud. A report on BBC's Here and Now programme
says up to 4,000 prisoners are claiming benefits - at an annual cost of
Pounds 9m to Pounds 25m. The Department of Social Security said it believed
the programme exaggerates the fraud but confirmed that the Prison Service
gave the DSS details of all 35,000 convicted inmates in prison last week.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Labour attacks cuts in criminal injury awards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was forced on to the defensive yesterday by Labour attacks on
plans to speed up the criminal injuries compensation scheme.
Mr John Major defended the government's plans to replace individual
assesments with a tariff scheme during irritable question time exchanges.
The prime minister said the changes, which will take effect in April, would
make the system more efficient and speed up payments to claimants. But it
later emerged that the changes would reduce the annual bill for compensation
payments from about Pounds 500m a year to Pounds 250m by the end of the
decade.
The government expects 46 per cent of claimants to be worse off under the
new system, which will replace individual assessment with fixed payments.
The proposals have been criticised in both houses of parliament, and there
is growing unrest among Conservative backbenchers about the impact on the
victims of crime.
Mr John Smith, Labour leader, sought to exploit Tory unease by claiming that
compensation for police officers seriously injured in criminal attacks would
fall from Pounds 121,000 to Pounds 7,500. He said that a young woman with
two children who saw her husband murdered at her own front door had received
Pounds 137,000 under the existing scheme, but would have received only
Pounds 17,000 after April.
'Why should she lose Pounds 120,000 under a government cost-cutting
exercise?' he asked. 'Is it not bad enough that crime has doubled under this
government without making the victims pay for it?'

FT  09 MAR 94 / Fourth mobile phone network to be launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hutchison Microtel yesterday confirmed that it would be launching a cellular
mobile network next month and announced that it would be called 'Orange'.
The network will be the UK's fourth, competing against Vodafone, Cellnet and
Mercury One-2-One, which was launched within the M25 area last September.
Microtel chose the name in an effort to conjure up the image of cellular
communications as 'fresh, attractive, and not impossibly complicated to
use'.
Microtel, whose largest shareholder is Hutchison Whampoa, the Hong Kong
conglomerate, refused to disclose the Orange tariffs yesterday, but said
they would be 'highly competitive' with those of existing networks.
The launch of One-2-One last year, with free local calls on weekday evenings
and at weekends, is widely credited with ensuring the breakthrough of
cellular mobile telephony into the consumer market.
The Orange network is based on the same technology as One-2-One, but it will
be more extensive at launch. It will cover more than half of the UK's
population initially, extending to 90 per cent by mid-1995.
One-2-One's network is limited to south-east England, although it is being
ex-panded.
The Orange network will be digital, as is One-2-One. The handsets are likely
to be more expensive than those for the analogue networks run by Vodafone
and Cellnet, but Orange is likely to compensate with cheaper operating
charges.
There has been much speculation that Hutchison Whampoa has tried to sell
Microtel, in which it has invested more than Pounds 700m.
Last year the conglomerate announced its intention to reduce its
telecommunications operations outside Hong Kong, and closed its unsuccessful
Rabbit telepoint venture in the UK.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Canal paths used for fibre-optic grid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Competition for long-distance telecommunications traffic was stepped up
yesterday by the launch of a company using Britain's canal tow-paths to
build a fibre-optic network.
Fibreway says it is the first company engaged solely in the wholesaling of
capacity to other operators. It will offer no services directly to
end-users, but will sell capacity to the growing array of entrants to the UK
market.
Construction of a link between Edinburgh and Glasgow is under way, with
others planned in the Midlands. With more than 2,000 miles of canal
available, the potential exists to create a network linking most of the UK's
biggest cities. The three existing long-distance networks are owned by
companies which also provide telecoms services to consumers. They are
British Telecommunications, Mercury, and Energis, which will launch a
service next month.
Fibreway's largest shareholder is GPT, the telecoms equipment joint venture
between GEC and Siemens, the German group. It is acting in partnership with
British Waterways. Mr Gerry Boothroyd, Fibreway's director, said that
initial investment would be in the 'tens of millions', with network
construction determined by demand.
Cable companies building local networks in urban areas are keen to see a
diversity of long-distance operators.
Mr Eugene Connell, head of UK operations for Nynex, the US group making
significant UK cable investments, expressed 'serious interest' in the new
operator as a means of linking Nynex's franchises in different parts of the
country.
The idea of using canal tow-paths for a telecoms network has been in the air
for several years, but appeared to founder two years ago when Sprint, the US
long-distance carrier, dropped plans to build its own UK network.
The railways are already used for telecoms. Part of Mercury's long-distance
network runs alongside the tracks, and British Rail's own telecoms
subsidiary is preparing to offer a service to outside operators.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Fowler plays Euro defence card
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservative party is putting defence firmly at the heart of its
campaign for the European elections in June.
Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, and Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence
secretary, yesterday launched a sweeping attack bracketing both main
opposition parties together for the purposes of the assault.
With a strong Liberal Democrat challenge expected in Tory seats in the
south-west of England - a region in which the defence industry is one of the
largest employers - many of yesterday's most vituperative comments were
aimed at Mr Paddy Ashdown's party.
The two Tory politicians also used a Westminster press conference to launch
a 25-page document setting out the principal differences on defence between
all three leading parties.
The main thrust of Sir Norman's attack was to try to tar Labour and the
Liberal Democrats with the same brush by claiming that there was a
latter-day 'Lib-Lab pact' on defence.
This consisted of a three-part plan comprising 'drastic' defence cuts, the
surrender of control over Britain's security policy to Brussels and the
creation of a European army. 'On defence Labour and the Liberals have the
same agenda,' he said.
Mr Rifkind attacked the 'brave captain Ashdown' who liked to wrap himself in
the union flag and present himself as a great warrior but had appeared on
CND platforms 'not all that long ago'.
In a development which may disconcert Tory backbenchers who have complained
that recent defence cuts were Treasury-driven, there was a strong emphasis
on good housekeeping in yesterday's document.
'It remains incumbent upon the Ministry of Defence to deliver the nation's
required war fighting capability at least cost to the taxpayer,' the
document says.
One of the chief justifications for Nato remaining the cornerstone of
Britain's defence policy is that otherwise 'we would have to spend more to
achieve the level of security we have now'.
Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, described the press conference as
'a panic reaction by a government that has grossly mismanaged Britain's
defences'.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Spate of TV mergers attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Independent Television Commission's chief executive last night attacked
the recent spate of takeovers in ITV and suggested that they were driven
more by ambition than commercial considerations.
Mr David Glencross said in a hard-hitting speech to the Royal Television
Society that the advantages of size were not as clear-cut as often claimed.
He was speaking as MAI's bid for Anglia Television went unconditional and
after Carlton Communications's takeover of Central and Granada's successful
hostile bid for London Weekend Television.
Some time and expense would be saved by simplifying decision-taking in ITV
but, he said, takeovers were driven by three factors. 'In order of priority
they are ambition, ambition and ambition.' He added that already nearly
Pounds 50m had been spent in servicing the deals.
Even the newly enlarged ITV companies were small by international standards
and it was a misconception to think size by itself would create a thriving
programme export business.
Mr Glencross said: 'There is nothing to stop a consortium of the ITV
companies, and the BBC too, if it wishes, getting together to produce for
the export market without any change in the ownership rules.'
The government decision to allow larger ITV companies to be taken over by
each other had 'added to, rather than resolved the uncertainty about the
future of ITV'. Smaller companies could be left dangerously exposed.
Mr Glencross criticised the 1990 Broadcasting Act for making the ITV
companies the most taxed television companies in the world. Last year Pounds
360m, a quarter of ITV's advertising and sponsorship revenue, went to the
Treasury, almost as much as the total revenue of Channel 4.
He added: 'So in effect the cost of an entire national television channel is
being handed to the Treasury in addition to the normal corporation tax paid
by the Channel 3 companies.'
The ITC chief executive also said that:
Newspaper stakes in ITV should be able to rise from 20 per cent to 30 per
cent but that limit should be applied by stages to satellite groups such as
British Sky Broadcasting, half-owned by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News
Corporation.
A new Channel 5 could start within two years without inhibiting the launch
of digital services.

FT  09 MAR 94 / From sop to soap-opera success: The S4C channel's rise to
Oscar contender
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In its early days so few people watched S4C, the Welsh fourth channel, the
joke was that it would have been been cheaper to give Welsh speakers free
video recorders.
More than a decade later all that has changed. The television channel that
was seen as a political sop to the Welsh nationalists has not only found an
audience and helped to stimulate a television and film production industry,
but even has a seat at the Oscars ceremony in Los Angeles later this month.
The Welsh-language film Hedd Wyn, the story of a poet from Trawsfynydd and
his death in the trenches during the first world war, is one of five
nominations for the foreign film Oscar.
S4C commissioned and paid for the Pounds 700,000 film, which has already won
a Royal Television Society award for best UK drama.
'I'm keeping my fingers crossed that I may go out with an Oscar,' says Mr
Geraint Stanley Jones, who retires at the end of next month after five years
running the channel.
'What it means is that finally there's a recognition that small could be
quite good actually and that a funny language may not be that restrictive,'
says the S4C chief executive who was formerly the BBC's first managing
director of regional programmes.
Recently S4C has migrated from Wales to BBC 2 with its Welsh language soap
opera Pobol Y Cwm - People of the Valleys. The popular drama, complete with
English sub-titles, has been getting afternoon audiences of about 600,000.
With the original S4C viewing attracting audiences of about 250,000, 1m
viewers for Pobol Y Cwm might be possible in future.
The channel broadcasts 32 hours a week in Welsh, although a growing
percentage of Welsh-language programmes carry English sub-titles. The rest
of the time S4C reschedules popular Channel 4 programmes such as Brookside
and The Big Breakfast.
Placing more emphasis on drama and English sub-titles has resulted in
increased ratings. In November 1988 the top 10 Welsh-language programmes
averaged 74,700 viewers each. By November 1992 this figure had risen to
125,600 and by last November to 202,700.
S4C is now funded by a 3.2 per cent share of non-satellite advertising
revenue - which includes income from the breakfast franchise and Channel 4 -
paid in the form of a block grant from the Treasury via the Department of
National Heritage. Last year this accounted for Pounds 55.7m. The channel is
also free to sell its own advertising and is expected to raise Pounds 6m
this year.
It also expects Pounds 10m in co-production money - S4C has made programmes
with broadcasters as diverse as ZDF of Germany, ABC of Australia and
Fujisanki of Japan, with a particular emphasis on animation.
The animated tales of Shakespeare sold to 50 countries and the station is
working on a multi-million pound animation of the Old Testament with
Christmas Films of Moscow.
As Mr Stanley Jones hands over to the new chief executive Mr Huw Jones, a
leading Welsh independent producer, it seems a very reasonable legacy for a
channel born after Mr Gwynfor Evans, president of Plaid Cymru, the Welsh
nationalist party, threatened to go on hunger strike if one was not created.

FT  09 MAR 94 / ITC urged to prevent advert sale monopoly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two leading organisations representing the advertising industry have called
for strict regulation of television advertising sales to prevent what are in
effect monopolies developing, Raymond Snoddy writes.
The Institute of Practitioners in Advertising and the Association of Media
Independents have told the Independent Television Commission they would
accept one sales point being responsible for up to 25 per cent of all
television advertising in the UK - but only with conditions.
The ITC is looking at its rules governing the sale of television advertising
with the presumption that the maximum threshold will be lifted from 25 per
cent of ITV to 25 per cent of all television sales.
If that happens the IPA wants to see a prohibition on advertising being sold
in a package for two or more competing television services such as regional
ITV companies, GMTV, the breakfast service, Channel 4 or the two London ITV
stations. The institute also wants to see a ban on any advertising sales
points with 25 per cent of the market having shareholdings in, or influence
over, a competitor.
The media independents want a sales structure 'which is independent,
accountable and transparent'.
The institute wants any sales organisation with more than 20 per cent of the
market to be a separate legal entity with independent directors, and to
declare net quarterly revenue to clear criteria.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Lib Dems target urban Tory seats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liberal Democrats yesterday outlined plans to target urban Conservative
seats in an attempt to establish the party as the main metropolitan
alternative to Labour in the May local government elections.
Launching a paper on urban policy Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat
leader, said Britain's rundown cities could be regenerated through
decentralisation and wider council powers over taxation and planning.
The paper, Reclaiming the City, aims to build on the Liberal Democrat's
successes in last year's county council elections, when the party made
widespread gains at the expense of the Tories. It attacks the government for
imposing undemocratic quangos on local government and 'failing either to
arrest the underlying processes of urban decay or to ameliorate the
effects'.
Mr Ashdown said the paper was intended to challenge the public view of the
Liberal Democrats as a rural party of the south-west of England, Scotland
and Wales.
'Up and down the country we are moving away from being a party exclusively
winning seats in rural areas and one which is becoming an inner-city
alternative to the Labour party,' he said.
The paper is based on the Liberal Democrats' long-standing commitment to
decentralise local government under a new tier of regional assemblies for
Scotland, Wales and the English regions.
It calls for lower business rates; local agencies to mobilise savings and
channel national and European funds into development projects; tax relief
for municipal development bonds; and workforce agreements to ensure that
local people benefit directly from jobs created by redevelopment projects.
It also urges the use of planning law to direct businesses and homes back to
inner-city areas, combined with a development tax to discourage development
on greenfield sites.
The paper also calls for a substantial increase in light rail and other
public transport systems.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Economic indicator's rise ends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent rise in the Central Statistical Office's longer leading index has
ended, new data showed yesterday. The index is designed to detect turning
points in the economy about a year in advance.
The index, whose components include the yield curve, building starts, the
financial balances of industrial and commercial companies and business
optimism, is now flat. This is mainly due to a large downward revision to
December's housebuilding figures.
However, the shorter leading index - intended to highlight changes in
activity about five months ahead using share prices, car registrations and
the Gallup index of consumer confidence - continued its 15-month rise.
The coincident indicator, which tracks the business cycle, has risen
steadily from its trough in the second quarter of 1992. All its components -
including GDP at factor cost, industrial production, retail sales and M0
money supply - have contributed this year.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Scottish exports up 30% in 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Exports of manufactured goods from Scotland rose by more than 30 per cent in
value last year, says a new index of Scottish exports, James Buxton writes.
The index, based on figures from 26 companies which account for 60 per cent
of all Scottish exports, rose from its base of 100 in the first quarter to
130.1 for the fourth quarter, suggesting exports worth Pounds 10.9bn in the
whole of 1993. Although all industrial sectors showed growth, the strongest
export sector was computers.
The index is compiled by Scottish Council Development and Industry, which
lobbies for economic development.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Oftel imposes tighter regime on BT charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications faces a sharp increase in regulation as Oftel,
the telecommunications watchdog, tries to open the UK market to greater
competition.
A new supervisory regime announced yesterday by Oftel will provide for the
regulator to set and publish the price of more than 70 charges levied by BT
on competitors needing to use its network to carry their calls.
It will also force BT to publish separate accounts for its network and
retail businesses to reduce the advantage the company gains as a retailer
from owning the country's largest telecoms network.
Payments to BT, which controls about 90 per cent of the UK telecoms market,
represent about half of the total costs of rival operators.
The largest rival is Mercury, but dozens of new operators have gained
licences in the past two years, including cable companies build-ing combined
television and telephone networks in urban areas.
Mr Don Cruickshank, Oftel director-general, said the changes were essential
to promote a transparent, competitive telecoms market. He said: 'I hope BT
will increasingly see other operators as customers as well as competitors.'
BT views new operators solely as a threat, however, and is anxious to avoid
becoming little more than a wholesaler of network capacity to other service
providers.
At present it sets charges for competitors using its network by negotiation,
with a right of appeal to Oftel - exercised twice by Mercury. The prices
have been confidential and vary between operators.
In future, competitors will pay for key interconnection services at
standard, published tariffs set by Oftel.
BT condemned Oftel's 'costly increase in regulation'. But Mr Michael Hepher,
BT managing director, has assured Oftel of co-operation in the introduction
of accounting separation, which will apply from this financial year.
Mr Cruickshank said the level of detailed regulation proposed was
'absolutely essential' to develop competition. He added: 'BT is presently
not offering the same price for the same thing to competitors and it is not
demonstrating to operators how prices are reached.'
Oftel's standard interconnection charges will initially be based on its
determination last year of the long-running dispute between BT and Mercury
over network payments.
Mercury is contesting the determination in the High Court in an attempt to
secure a more favourable settlement. Mr Cruickshank made no further
concessions to Mercury yesterday but repeated his intention to examine its
proposals as a medium-term option.
Mr Richard Woollam, director-general of the Cable Television Association,
said Oftel's plans were 'roughly in line with what we have been looking
for'.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Malaysia still cool after Prior visit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Senior Malaysian officials have warned that it may take some time for
Britain to improve relations. This is in spite of attempts by leading
British business figures to persuade Kuala Lumpur to lift an order banning
UK companies from participating in new government contracts.
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, yesterday had a lengthy
meeting with Lord Prior, chairman of GEC and a former British cabinet
minister.
Although British diplomats in Kuala Lumpur stressed that Lord Prior's
secretive two-day visit to Malaysia was private, a senior official in London
said the mission 'had the blessing of Downing Street'.
Lord Prior was believed to be on his way back to London last night and is
expected to report to Mr John Major today on his meeting with Dr Mahathir.
Sir Charles Powell, a director of Trafalgar House and former foreign affairs
adviser to Mr Major and Baroness Thatcher, has also been in Malaysia.
GEC is among the British companies hardest hit by the Malaysian ban.
Together with Trafalgar House and Balfour Beatty, it is part of an
Anglo-Japanese consortium which had been hoping to carry out a large part of
the work on a new Pounds 3bn international airport outside Kuala Lumpur. GEC
has also sold defence equipment to Malaysia under the controversial 1988
memorandum of understanding between the two countries.
Malaysian officials privately admit that Dr Mahathir is unlikely to take any
quick decision to rescind his government's order against British companies.
It is felt that Dr Mahathir wants a more outspoken condemnation from Downing
Street of reports in the British media - in particular a report in The
Sunday Times - alleging that he and other members of the Malaysian
government had been involved in seeking under-the-table payments from a
British company.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Heseltine rejects role as next Tory chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine has dismissed suggestions from prominent Tory MPs that
he should take over as Conservative party chairman after the government's
expected defeats in local and European elections this summer.
His determination to stay at the Department of Trade and Industry emerged as
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, failed to dispel speculation that he and
Mr Heseltine are preparing for a leadership contest later this year.
Mr Clarke insisted during a series of interviews yesterday that he expected
Mr John Major to lead the Conservatives into the general election due by
1997. That echoed Mr Major's public reaffirmation earlier this week of his
determination to hold on to the premiership.
But the chancellor, who said he was fed up with being quizzed about the
leadership, again admitted his long-term ambitions to become prime minister.
That and a couple of verbal slips suggesting that Mr Major's position was
not entirely secure were seen at Westminster as evidence that Mr Clarke is
anxious to keep open his options in the event of an early leadership crisis.
Mr Heseltine has told close friends that he wants to remain in his present
post when Mr Major unveils his expected cabinet reshuffle after the summer
elections. He has not received any indication from 10 Downing Street that
the prime minister will seek to move him.
The speculation that Mr Major might ask Mr Heseltine to lead the
Conservatives' campaign for the next general election has been fanned by
intense suspicion on the right of the Tory party that he is positioning
himself for a leadership bid.
Prominent rightwing Tory MPs have been openly canvassing the idea that by
making him party chairman Mr Major could ensure Mr Heseltine's loyalty if
bad results in the local and European polls trigger a leadership crisis.
Sir Norman Fowler, the present chairman, has already indicated his plan to
stand down and the MPs have suggested that Mr Heseltine would find it
impossible to turn down the job without appearing disloyal.
But friends of Mr Heseltine have dismissed as nonsense any suggestion that
he would pose a threat to the prime minister if he remained at the DTI.
The trade and industry secretary has made it clear that he has always
regarded his task of reshaping the government's approach to industry as one
that would take at least three years and probably longer.
Mr Heseltine's unwillingness to countenance a move leaves Mr David Hunt,
employment secretary, as the clear favourite for the party chairmanship.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Employers face Pounds 55m maternity pay bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The additional Pounds 55m a year cost of improved maternity payments, which
will benefit about 285,000 working women, will be met by employers, the
government said yesterday.
The announcement follows a government consultation which set out options for
adapting UK maternity benefits to meet European Union directive
requirements.
The new system, which must be in place by October 16, simplifies current
benefits which give different rates of maternity pay depending on whether a
women has worked 26 weeks, two years or five years in the same job.
In future, any woman who has been employed in the same job for 26 weeks or
more will be entitled to statutory maternity pay. This will be 90 per cent
of earnings for all recipients for the first six weeks and Pounds 52.50 for
the remaining 12 weeks.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, said in a Commons written reply
that the additional cost would be covered by reducing employers'
reimbursements for statutory maternity pay to 92 per cent from September 4
this year.
Small employers would continue to be fully reimbursed.
'As a whole employers will not be out of pocket,' said Mr Lilley. This was
because the reduction in employers' National Insurance contributions
announced in the Budget would more than compensate them.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Ministers' lies to MPs defended by Waldegrave
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr William Waldegrave, the public services minister, yesterday rekindled the
controversy over ministerial accountability raised by the arms-for-Iraq
affair when he appeared to defend lying to parliament.
Mr Waldegrave told the Commons Treasury and civil service committee that
ministers could be justified in 'very, very exceptional cases in saying
something that was untrue'. He added: 'Everyone accepts that.'
Mr Waldegrave said: 'Much of government activity is more like playing poker
than chess. You don't lay all your cards on the table.'
Mr Waldegrave's admission followed questioning over evidence given by Sir
Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary, to the Scott inquiry, which is
investigating the sale of arms to Iraq.
Sir Robin told the inquiry that giving incomplete answers to parliament was
frequently necessary. He added, however, that half-answers should not
mislead MPs other than in 'the most exceptional circumstances . . . like the
devaluation case'.
Mr Waldegrave repeated this formulation to the committee, and added that
ministers often could not tell the House all that they knew, 'especially in
relation to diplomatic matters'. He pointed out that parliament had appeared
to accept that it was right for the government not to reveal everything that
it was doing in order to bring peace to Northern Ireland.
Committee members expressed surprise at Mr Waldegrave's robust defence of
the practice. Mr Giles Radice, the committee's chairman, said that it was 'a
remarkable statement for a minister'.
Mr Quentin Davies, Tory MP for Stamford and Spalding, said the Commons had
on occasion accepted that ministers had to lie in the national interest. He
added, however, that it was the usual practice for a minister to offer his
resignation afterwards.
Mr Michael Meacher, shadow Citizen's Charter minister, called on the prime
minister to repudiate Mr Waldegrave's 'accommodation with dishonesty'.
He said: 'Trust and credibility are at the heart of democracy. If this
dangerous and highly damaging doctrine were once accepted, confidence in
ministers, already at the lowest ebb since the war, would completely
collapse.'
Mr Waldegrave told Channel 4 news that he was 'astonished' by the storm
raised by his remarks, which were directed solely at the 'exceptional' case
of an impending devaluation.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Dartford bridge likely to pay for itself by 2001
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Dartford bridge, the first project to be completed under the
government's initiative for private funding of transport links, is expected
to pay for itself by the year 2001, seven years ahead of schedule.
More than 37m vehicles used the crossing last year, generating income from
tolls of Pounds 41m, the Department of Transport said yesterday. The bridge,
which carries the M25 motorway across the Thames east of London, was
completed a little over two years ago for Pounds 86m.
Mr Robert Key, transport minister, said the success of the Dartford
crossing, officially called the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge, showed the value
of the government's private-finance initiative.
However, other attempts to bring private finance into infrastructure
projects have been blamed for delays in getting work under way.
The Dartford bridge was built and financed by a consortium consisting of
Trafalgar House, the construction company, merchant bank Kleinwort Benson,
Bank of America and the Prudential insurance company. They were awarded a
concession to collect tolls for up to 20 years.
Once the consortium breaks even on the bridge, ownership will transfer to
the government, which may then levy tolls for one year. If it wants to
continue tolls for longer it must seek parliamentary approval, although the
transport department hopes to introduce tolls on the entire motorway network
from 1998.
The British Road Federation said the bridge had ended congestion on the
river crossing but it owed much of its success to a lack of alternative
bridges or tunnels east of London.
The Automobile Association said motorists would be surprised the tolls had
been set at a level allowing such prompt repayment of the bridge's debts. It
called for the tolls to be dropped when the bridge reverted to public
ownership.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Spy chief seeks Scott secrecy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Spedding, Britain's new spy chief, is prepared to give evidence to
the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry but only if all members of the intelligence
services can continue to testify in camera.
Mr Spedding, who was last week named as the next head of MI6, owes his
promotion largely to his involvement in gathering information on Iraq's
nuclear programme. He is thus well placed to shed light on an area which has
been investigated by Lord Justice Scott and which includes the work done for
UK intelligence by former executives of Matrix Churchill.
A Scott inquiry spokesman said last night that the judge was not prepared to
comment on intelligence witnesses to his inquiry. The judge has already
taken written and oral evidence in private from several members of the
intelligence services, including some members of Mr Spedding's section
specialising in the Middle East and Sir Colin McColl, the outgoing head of
MI6.
After consultations with Whitehall officials, Lord Justice Scott decided
that the public interest in hearing evidence from an intelligence officer
was outweighed by the public interest in protecting his identity and some of
the information provided by him.
According to intelligence sources Mr Spedding is under instructions, 'like
any other member of Whitehall', to co-operate fully with the Scott inquiry.
This would include giving evidence in public if 'requested to do so by Lord
Justice Scott'. Mr Spedding believes, however, that evidence in camera best
serves a balance between a higher public profile for the service and the
continuing demand for secrecy in its operations.
The role of the intelligence services is expected to come under renewed
focus today when Mr Peter Wiltshire, a Customs officer involved in the
Matrix Churchill investigation, gives evidence to the inquiry.
The intelligence services are confident they have nothing to fear from the
inquiry. They believe the judge's report will largely exonerate those
involved in intelligence reporting and instead criticise a breakdown in
dissemination of information by non-intelligence officials and ministers.
The judge has been provided with numerous intelligence reports warning
Whitehall that Iraq was using British exports, mainly machine-tools, to
build up Iraqi conventional and nuclear capability from the mid-1980s.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Cadbury auditing proposal attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales yesterday
attacked a central recommendation of the Cadbury committee on corporate
governance that companies should report publicly on internal controls.
The institute's financial reporting and auditing group called instead for a
much reduced statement in companies' annual reports and a separate private
report from auditors to audit committees.
A Cadbury committee working group, which includes institute representatives,
is developing revised proposals on reporting on internal controls. An
earlier draft of its recommended guidance was widely criticised for being
too lengthy and impractical to implement, and the institute's statement
could prove another setback to the group's work.
Yesterday's report called for company accounts to include an internal
control statement by directors and a declaration that their responsibilities
have been met.
In a previous provocative statement last week, which put it at loggerheads
with the Auditing Practices Board, the institute's auditing committee argued
that guidance by the board on whether a company was a 'going concern' raised
a number of problems with which it could not agree.
These included the need for an accounting standard and the time into the
future over which auditors could provide reassurance.

FT  09 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Central America's 'model' accord - An
'advanced' trade deal between Mexico and Costa Rica
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The free trade agreement that Mexico and Costa Rica provisionally concluded
last week has been described as the most advanced between two Latin American
countries.
It will eventually remove tariff and most non-tariff barriers to trade in
goods and services between the two countries; offer national treatment to
investors from each country; set rules on intellectual property rights; ease
movement of workers between the two countries; and provide for a panel that
resolves disputes arising out of compliance with the accord.
Both countries predicted that the agreement would significantly boost
Mexican-Costa Rican trade, which stood at Dollars 215m (Pounds 147.2m) last
year.
However, by giving preferential access to each other's markets, the
agreements will hurt the two countries' existing trade partners, especially
other central American states.
The negotiations were formally wrapped up last Thursday night, and the text
is being written up by lawyers. Mexico's Trade Ministry expects the
agreement to be ready in four to six weeks and to be signed by the
respective presidents soon after.
The treaty will take effect from January 1 next year. Mexico's Trade
Ministry said Mexican exports of goods that Costa Rica did not produce would
be able to enter Costa Rica duty-free from next year. This covers about 80
per cent of Mexican exports, currently at tariffs of about 20 per cent.
Tariffs on the remainder of Mexican exports will be reduced over five, 10
and - for the most sensitive products - 15 years. Mexico in turn will allow
a majority of Costa Rican exports to enter duty-free in five years or less.
Mr Jaime Serra Puche, Mexico's trade minister, said the agreement was '. . .
without a doubt, one of the most advanced trade agreements between any Latin
American countries'.
He said the pact established 'a strong rule of origin that requires goods to
be made with inputs of the region; that is to say from Costa Rica or Mexico,
and that this is an important opportunity for Mexican suppliers of inputs
and primary materials, since Costa Rica's supply industry is not well
advanced'.
Mr Roberto Rojas, Costa Rica's trade minister, described the pact as the
first step toward Costa Rica's accession to the North American Free Trade
Agreement between the US, Mexico and Canada.
An official from Mexico's Trade Ministry said products would have to contain
50 per cent regional content to be considered Costa Rican or Mexican and
free of tariffs. As Mr Serra Puche made clear, such a rule of origin would
encourage Costa Rican companies that export to Mexico to source from Mexico
rather than neighbouring countries.
'What this accord is promoting is alliances and not competition between
Mexico and Costa Rica,' said the official. 'What we are looking for is that
Costa Rican and Mexican businessmen work together.'
This is the latest of a series of trade agreements in Latin America. Trade
experts from the region meeting in Santiago last week were warned in a
report from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America that there were
risks in such agreements, in particular bilateral ones.
It said the benefits of such deals 'were fewer when integration agreements
involve countries that are only minor trading partners'. It argued there was
a 'possibility that bilateral (or even broader) integration agreements
signed within the region might have restrictive effects'.
With low tariffs such as those that prevail in Latin America, the benefits
of such trade agreements were fewer, it said, and the accords could include
other aspects - such as rules of origin - that might discourage trade rather
than promote it.
It further suggested that the emergence of certain 'hub' countries, with
which most bilateral agreements were concluded, 'can also create incentives
for the polarisation of investment in these countries'.
Mr Serra Puche hoped the agreement with Costa Rica would provide a model for
similar accords between Mexico and remaining central American countries,
over which negotiations were continuing.
Mexico's trade minister expects to meet this month with counterparts from
Colombia and Venezuela to discuss their free trade agreement. The three
countries had hoped to sign the treaty in January before President Rafael
Caldera of Venezuela took office. Although Mexico claimed in December that
negotiations had concluded, last-minute differences over rules or origin for
chemicals and textiles made signing impossible, however.
The new Venezuelan government, less keen on free trade than its predecessor,
is said to have insisted on a re-negotiation of the treaty. The Mexican
government is willing to meet the Venezuelans and listen to their concerns,
but the Trade Ministry official said the agreement could not be re-opened.

Mercedes-Benz is to start assembling E-Class executive cars and

long-standing partner, Tata Engineering and Locomotive (Telco) of Bombay.
The partners will invest DM250m (Pounds 97.2m) in equipping a factory in
Poona with capacity for 20,000 cars and 50,000 petrol and diesel engines a
year.
Car assembly will start this year, while engine output is scheduled to begin
in 1995, Daimler-Benz, the Mercedes parent, said yesterday.
Mercedes will hold a 51 per cent stake in a new operating company,
Mercedes-Benz India, which will further tighten ties with Telco, in which
Daimler has a 10 per cent stake.
The two groups have co-operated since 1954, when Telco was awarded its first
licences to manufacture Mercedes commercial vehicles under licence.

FT  09 MAR 94 / World Trade News: US losing hope as tariff rows continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE and FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US trade officials are losing hope for any significant gains in the final
drive to negotiate tariff cuts in the Uruguay Round beyond those agreed last
December 15.
Countries taking part in the Uruguay Round of trade-liberalising talks are
still wrangling over the details of individual tariff schedules, three weeks
after the negotiations should have finished.
With the signing of the Round set for April 15 in Marrakesh, the
negotiations have entered the 'verification stage' on tariffs, which is
supposed to address only technical changes.
However, the US, Japan, EU and Canada - the so-called Quad countries -
continue to wrangle over tariff cuts on wood, white spirits, copper, and
aluminum. The only deal in sight is a cut in Japan's copper tariffs to the
equivalent of 5 per cent.
Trade officials in Geneva said yesterday that talks, mostly bilateral, were
continuing to try to sort out remaining differences. These mainly concern
items where tariff concessions shown in the submitted schedules do not match
what countries thought they had achieved in earlier negotiations.
More than 60 schedules have been submitted, with 22 still outstanding. Least
developed countries are not obliged to submit schedules at this stage.
A US official said Japan and the EU had continued to block progress by
refusing to cut their most sensitive tariffs. March 25, the date set by the
Gatt secretariat as the deadline for submission of final tariff schedules,
is now seen as the final deadline for the market access talks.
Progress on wood, particularly, would be 'a good thing' for US-Japan
relations, the official said. A 50 per cent reduction over five years has
been agreed, but that will still leave Japanese wood tariffs at 6 per cent.
The US industry has even joined the fray, buying advertisements in Japanese
newspapers claiming that a tariff phase-out would bring the cost of housing
down by 20 per cent.
At a meeting of negotiators yesterday in Geneva, convened to discuss the
schedules, Japan repeated complaints that the US had withdrawn earlier
offers on films, electronic products and non-ferrous metals. EU officials on
Monday expressed disappointment over US tariff reductions on copper and
trucks.
Japan is also unhappy about the EU's offer on televisions and video cameras,
while Indonesia and Malaysia have complained about the link between lower EU
wood tariffs and a lifting of their restrictions on export of raw logs.
Concern was voiced yesterday about a US 'headnote' in the textiles and
clothing section referring to Washington's intention to pursue talks with
some exporting nations, such as India and Pakistan, to reduce their import
barriers. The US stressed this was not being made a condition for tariff
reductions.
However, it urged US negotiators to pursue 'aggressively' further tariff
cuts to enhance 'significantly the economic benefits of the Uruguay Round'.
The meagre results of these final talks are a severe blow to US industry.
The influential Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations, a
business and labour panel appointed by the president, said further tariff
cuts were vital.
The textile industry is even more insistent on progress. Mr Henry Truslow,
president of the American Textile Manufacturers' Institute, threatened last
week to oppose the trade pact in Congress unless the US won 'critically
needed market access commitments from countries which today flood US markets
with their clothing and textile products'.
Although market opening offers have been received from Malaysia, Chile, the
Czech Republic and Slovakia, no tariff cut offer has been received from
Pakistan. India has offered small cuts, which US officials dismiss as
inadequate.
'Time is running out,' said Mr Truslow. 'We see no progress on making the
major offenders agree to open their markets.
'It is time for our government to take a stand and say the US will not phase
out its Multifibre Arrangement quotas for countries which keep their markets
closed.'

Caribbean Basin countries increased the volume and value of apparel exported

the US market.
The Caribbean's apparel exports to the US in 1993 totalled 12.3bn square
metres, 24 per cent more than in the previous year and well ahead of the 6
per cent increase in worldwide apparel exports to the US last year.
Earnings by Caribbean Basin countries from the US increased 23 per cent last
year to Dollars 3.9bn (Pounds 2.67bn).
'The Caribbean Basin countries' share of the US apparel market grew to 13.74
per cent last year, compared to 14.9 per cent held by South East Asia's
Asean group, 4.15 per cent by the European Union, 2.24 per cent by Latin
America and 1.68 per cent by Africa,' said Mr Peter King, chairman of the
Caribbean's Textile and Apparel Institute.
'Some of the major product lines were knitted and woven shirts, trousers and
shorts, T-shirts, hosiery, underwear and foundation garments.'
Most of the region's apparel exports to the US are produced under the 807
offshore assembly programme which allows garments to be assembled in the
region from fabric made and cut in the US and re-exported to the US with
duty paid on the value added in assembly.
The main regional exporter to the US last year was the Dominican Republic
whose shipments increased by 18 per cent to earn Dollars 1.4bn. Costa Rica's
exports increased by 12 per cent to Dollars 650m, followed by Guatemala, up
2 per cent to Dollars 544m, Honduras up 43 per cent to Dollars 500m and
Jamaica up 31 per cent to Dollars 381m.
Mr King is forecasting another 25 per cent increase in volume and value of
regional apparel exports to the US this year, despite fears the Mexican
industry, using the North American Free Trade Agreement, could eat into
Caribbean markets.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Cool hand to guide Whitewater raft: Clinton hopes Cutler can
see him over political rapids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two Democrats, both lawyers, stand in a league of their own as heavyweight
troubleshooters with enormous Washington reputations. One is Mr Robert
Strauss, now 75, at various times national party chairman, special trade
representative and ambassador to Moscow under President George Bush.
The other is Lloyd Norton Cutler, whose clout and access to the upper
reaches of government far exceed the governmental positions he has nominally
held during nearly 50 years in Washington.
Born in New York and a Yale Law School graduate like the president and Mrs
Hillary Rodham Clinton, this urbane, witty and charming man is a fixture on
the social circuit and in the political backrooms that used to be
smoke-filled.
His law firm, Wilmer, Cutler and Pickering, which he helped found in 1962,
is a star in the Washington legal firmament, its domestic and foreign
clients generally of the blue chip variety, its lawyers always in and out of
government.
Mr Cutler's personal and political briefs have long been at the cutting
edges of US domestic and foreign policy. He was active in the civil rights
movement and other liberal causes, a member of the 1968-70 Eisenhower
commission on the prevention and causes of violence, the unpaid co-ordinator
of President Jimmy Carter's attempts to get the Salt Two treaty ratified and
a frequent commentator on constitutional and ethical issues.
Earlier this year he was the principal lawyer in the case that successfully
overturned the Washington State law imposing term limits on elected
representatives. But, to combat political 'gridlock', he has also advocated
a constitutional amendment to co-ordinate the congressional and presidential
election cycles by giving House members four-year terms, not two, and
senators eight, rather than six.
But there is an unpredictable streak, too. In 1987 he offended many liberal
friends by coming to the defence of Mr Robert Bork, President Ronald
Reagan's conservative Supreme Court nominee ultimately rejected by the
Senate. In 1992, along with another Democratic eminence grise, Mr Paul
Nitze, he gave some advice to Mr Ross Perot prior to his independent
presidential candidacy.
His appointment as White House counsel is reminiscent of the circumstances
of August 1979. The Carter administration was already in trouble even before
the Iranian hostage crisis and its White House legal counsel, Mr Robert
Lipshutz, under fire for taking too narrow a legal view of his
responsibilities.
The same criticism is now levelled at the departing Mr Bernard Nussbaum,
whose resignation was announced at the weekend, and at the general White
House staff with its heavy component of friends of the president.
Last summer, when also under attack after a series of mishaps, Mr Clinton
reached into the Washington establishment to appoint Mr David Gergen,
denizen of Republican White Houses, as a senior adviser. The improvement in
presidential fortunes owed not a little to this move, although Mr Gergen is
now less visible and is frequently reported to be thinking of moving on.
Mr Cutler's second White House term will not be long either. He said
yesterday that he had agreed to stay only for 'a period of months'. He is
unlikely to last until Mr Robert Fiske, the independent counsel
investigating the Whitewater affair, produces his report next year or the
year after. But if he gets the White House show back on the road in the
meanwhile, he will have earned his stripes yet again.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday reached into the upper echelons of the
Washington establishment for assistance over the Whitewater affair by
appointing Mr Lloyd Cutler, the celebrated Democratic lawyer, as his new
White House legal counsel.
Mr Cutler, 76, who served in the same capacity in the troubled last year of
the Carter administration, said yesterday he would concentrate on
'procedures and actions necessary to maintain public confidence in the
integrity and openness of the presidency'.
The White House has said for several days it was looking for 'a Lloyd Cutler
type figure' of unquestioned stature to replace Mr Bernard Nussbaum, whose
resignation was announced last weekend.
Mr Cutler said he was supposed to be 'counsel to the president in office and
to the office of the presidency' but would not handle Mr Clinton's personal
affairs dating from before he took office.
News of the appointment did not deter Republicans insisting hearings be held
into allegations the White House has sought to obstruct investigations into
the Whitewater affair, which involves Mr and Mrs Clinton's land and
financial dealings in Arkansas in the 1980s.
Congressman Newt Gingrich of Georgia said yesterday the legislature 'has an
independent obligation to investigate and to inform both itself and the
country'. Republicans have already threatened to hold up the nomination of
Ms Ricki Tigert to run the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation if
Democrats refuse to agree to hearings.
Mr Gingrich also dismissed objections from Mr Robert Fiske, the independent
counsel probing Whitewater, who said hearings on Capitol Hill 'would pose a
severe risk' to the integrity of his inquiries.
Mr Fiske is mindful of the Iran-Contra precedent, where grants of immunity
from prosecution given by Congress as a pre-condition for testimony
ultimately resulted in the conviction on criminal charges of Oliver North
being overturned.
But Mr Jim Leach from Iowa, senior Republican on the House banking
committee, said there was no reason why anybody testifying over Whitewater
should be granted immunity. His committee already has plans to question
Treasury officials later this month.
The Democratic leadership in Congress, according to Mr Leach, is now on the
horns of a dilemma, not wanting to appear to obstruct the probe but also not
wanting to embarrass the president, orjeopardise his legislative programme.
Mr Tom Foley, the Speaker of the House, has warned against the legal
complications that might follow hearings, but has not come out flatly
against them. Yesterday, Senator John Breaux, the Louisiana Democrat,
speaking of the 'partisan setting' of Congress, said: 'We don't need
political hearings, we need legal hearings.'
Mr Clinton opened up one possible new avenue of inquiry on Monday when he
said he had been told last October that federal regulators wanted a criminal
investigation of Madison Guaranty, the Arkansas savings and loan institution
at the heart of the affair.
He insisted this information had been routinely passed on to him and was the
limit of his knowledge of contacts between the White House and other
departments. Yesterday Mr Clinton stoutly defended himself. 'I still haven't
been accused of doing anything wrong, because I have not done anything wrong
and I am not going to do anything wrong.'

FT  09 MAR 94 / Banco Latino 'a victim for political reasons'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The former president of Venezuela's Banco Latino, taken over by the
government in January, says the bank was victimised for political reasons
and was in no worse shape than other banks the government has chosen to
save.
Mr Gustavo Gomez Lopez said the decision to intervene at the bank was made
by the country's previous government under President Ramon Velasquez 'more
for political than technical reasons'.
Latino, Venezuela's second biggest bank, was seen by Mr Velasquez' interim
government as having aided the political and personal fortunes of
ex-president Carlos Andres Perez, he added.
Mr Perez, forced to leave the presidency last year to face corruption
charges, had a long and close association with important shareholders of the
bank.
Mr Gomez, speaking by phone from an undisclosed location outside Venezuela,
said: 'The government intervened in my bank and I am now seen as a criminal.
But in the case of other Venezuelan banks suffering from liquidity problems,
the government is providing them with financial aid and is not prosecuting
anyone.
He admitted Banco Latino was in trouble, but 'it was no more problematic
than other Venezuelan banks. When I took over I raised capital and tried to
change the bank from what it had been.'
Mr Gomez, 43, resigned as president of Banco Latino in December after 18
years at the bank and 14 months as chief executive. He left Venezuela soon
after, he said, because friends warned him he would be a target of
persecution. 'I didn't want to be held in a police cellar incommunicado.
I'll return to Venezuela when the (political) climate changes'.
Last week, a criminal court judge in Caracas issued arrest warrants against
Mr Gomez and 82 others suspected of being involved in the downfall of the
bank. Latino's failure set off a crisis in Venezuela's financial system and
triggered a wave of frantic dollar purchases in January and February. Mr
Gomez, who said he is not guilty of any wrongdoing, is charged with illegal
appropriation, fraud, conspiracy and approving false financial statements.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Congress embarks on health bill draft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Congress yesterday took its first tentative step towards putting together a
healthcare reform bill when a House of Representatives panel sat down to try
to draft legislation.
The subcommittee, a healthcare panel of the influential Ways and Means
Committee, is chaired by Congressman Pete Stark of California, whose own
proposal for reform is somewhat to the left of the plan put forward by
President Bill Clinton's administration.
Mr Stark wants to add a new category to the government-run Medicare
programme which now provides health insurance for the elderly, to cover both
the poor and unemployed, including those now included in the parallel
government Medicaid programme.
The new Medicare category would also be open to companies with up to 100
employees, who would, if they chose this option, have to pay 80 per cent of
the premium for their employees.
Controversially, Mr Stark also proposed yesterday a 0.8 per cent payroll tax
to raise Dollars 24bn a year, on top of the tobacco tax increase advocated
in the Clinton plan, to pay for some of the cost of expanding health
insurance to cover the entire US population.
While Mr Stark's proposal is seen by many members of Congress as redolent of
the kind of state-run medicine that provokes goosebumps among US doctors,
patients and politicians alike, its strength is that it is built on
Medicare, which is not only familiar but also generally popular among the
groups it serves.
Although the proposal differs in many respects from Mr Clinton's ideas,
which are based on health alliances to purchase insurance, White House
officials appeared happy that the Ways and Means subcommittee was at least
setting the legislative ball in motion.
Other subcommittees which have jurisdiction over parts of the healthcare
reform package have deadlocked, and the entire issue of reforming the system
has lost momentum.
Further complicating the task is the current preoccupation with the
WhiteWater financial affair, which has not only absorbed all the energies of
a good portion of the senior White House staff in recent days, but also cast
an unfavourable light on Mrs Hillary Clinton, who has been the
administration's principal spokesperson on health reform.
Mr Clinton yesterday expressed his optimism that a health care reform bill
will, in the end, pass the Congress.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Violence mars road to Colombia elections: The congressional
campaign trail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARITA KENDALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If more elections and more contenders are a sign of greater democracy, then
Colombia is doing well. There are 928 slates of candidates registered for
congressional elections on Sunday, when the official Liberal party
presidential candidate will also be chosen.
However, at least 10 congressional candidates have been killed, kidnapped or
injured during the campaign. One sociologist calculates that elections in
more than half Colombia's municipalities are affected by guerrilla violence.
The proliferation of congressional lists seems to be more a measure of the
atomisation of the two main parties than of democratic vigour. In the
south-western department of Valle, for example, more than 25 Liberal groups
are competing for the 13 seats.
The power of the regional chiefs has broken down and the new voting card
makes it more difficult to buy votes than it was in the past. Even a young
political party such as M-19, the former guerrilla movement, is suffering
from disunity and presenting three slates in Valle.
Given that so many candidates are unknown and have little more than a slogan
for a programme, the Liberal party of current president Cesar Gaviria is
trying to capture voters with vague, feel-good publicity.
Abstention normally varies from about half to two thirds in Colombian
elections; this time the large number of investigations into congressmen's
misdoings and a widely held assumption that drug money helps fund many
campaigns have reinforced disillusionment with politics. However, the
Liberal party holds, and will probably retain, a comfortable majority in
both houses.
In the race for the Liberal party presidential candidacy, the winner is
virtually certain to be Mr Ernesto Samper, who is far ahead of his Liberal
rivals in the opinion polls. The first round of the presidential elections
will take place on May 8, followed by a second round on May 29 if no
candidate wins an outright majority.
Mr Samper has been on the campaign trail since the middle of last year, but
his Conservative party opponent, Mr Andres Pastrana, launched himself into
the race only last month. Although some opinion polls give Mr Pastrana a
clear advantage, others put Mr Samper slightly ahead.
A Liberal presidential victory is less likely to guarantee continuity in
economic policy than a Conservative one. While both candidates stress social
spending to offset the effects of opening up the economy, Mr Pastrana leans
further towards wanting to attract foreign capital, privatisation and
joining the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Mr Samper is staking a lot on an ambitious employment programme linked to
economic growth rates of more than 5 per cent a year. Arguing that poverty
and violence go with unemployment, he hopes to create 1.5m jobs over the
four-year term through sectoral plans for agriculture, the modernisation of
industry, exports and small businesses.
Although they both say they would like to be remembered for bringing peace
to Colombia, neither Mr Samper nor Mr Pastrana has come up with a considered
strategy for reducing violence. Both agree that dialogue is still an option
and the government is currently talking on three fronts  - with splinter
groups from the main guerrilla armies, with drug traffickers and with urban
militia organisations.
However, the attempt to bring the guerrillas into the democratic system will
be hampered by the experience of former Maoist guerrillas who chose the
democratic path and founded the Hope, Peace and Freedom party: 140 of them
have been killed.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Riot police fired live ammunition on demonstrators in the nominally
independent black 'homeland' of Bophuthatswana yesterday as strikes and
anti-government protests swept the capital, increasing political pressure on
President Lucas Mangope.
In the capital, Mmbatho, and its twin town of Mafikeng, security forces for
a second day fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse demonstrators.
Earlier in the day riot police stormed the broadcasting centre after the
Bophuthatswana Broadcasting Corporation's chairman - Mr Eddie Mangope, son
of the president - was locked in the building by striking workers.
The occupation of broadcasting centre and demonstrations were part of a
growing series of protests against Mr Mangope, who is resisting South
Africa's transition to black majority rule and has refused to register for
next month's all-race elections.
The protests began with a civil servants' strike, sparked by demands that
their pensions be paid out before the April elections, after which
Bophuthatswana will cease to exist as it will be reincorporated into South
Africa. Civil servants feared the homeland would use their pension fund to
pay government expenses if financial transfers from Pretoria - which account
for about one-third of Bophuthatswana's budget - were cut to put pressure on
Mr Mangope to take part in elections.
The Transitional Executive Council, the multi-party body which oversees
South Africa's transition to democracy, believes it has the power to cut off
funds to Bophuthatswana, though this has not yet been tested.
Since then the strike has widened into generalised demonstrations against Mr
Mangope, encouraged by the African National Congress which wants him to
accept the elections, having failed to negotiate the regional powers which
Bophuthatswana and other right-wing groups wanted in exchange for poll
participation.
Mr Mangope has so far refused to allow campaigning in the homeland. ANC
President Nelson Mandela said it was only a matter of time before action was
taken against him. The ANC has urged President FW de Klerk's government to
halt all financial aid and supplies to Bophuthatswana to force it to
participate in the elections.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Prosecutors raid Japanese MP's office: Nakamura ready for
battle

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese prosecutors moved against a national politician yesterday for the
first time in their year-long investigation into widespread corruption
involving the construction industry and the political establishment, Reuter
reports from Tokyo.
The Tokyo District Prosecutor's Office raided the offices of Mr Kishiro
Nakamura, former construction minister, whom they allege may have taken cash
in exchange for quashing an anti-trust investigation into bid rigging among
big builders.
Prosecutors set in motion a rarely-invoked constitutional procedure for
stripping a lawmaker of his immunity from arrest. It would be the first time
in 27 years that a Japanese lawmaker was subject to such humiliation.
But Mr Nakamura, from the conservative opposition Liberal Democratic party
(LDP), said he was willing to be arrested and fight the charges. Earlier he
had rejected repeated requests to show up at the prosecutor's office for
voluntary questioning.
But yesterday he issued a statement through his lawyers, saying he was ready
for a court battle. 'I dared to opt for being arrested. I am determined to
reveal the truth of the matter in court,' he said.
'As for my arrest, I want the prosecutors to designate the time and date. I
strongly hope to be arrested at the main entrance of the Diet (parliament)
building.'
Since the inquiry started in March last year, more than 30 executives of
Japan's six biggest building companies have been arrested along with four
local government leaders.
So far, no national politician has been arrested. Lawmakers cannot be
arrested while parliament is in session. Normally anyone who comes under
scandal allegations submits to voluntary questioning to avoid public
exposure.
Justice Minister Akira Mikazuki described Mr Nakamura's case as 'historic'
and voiced his full support for the prosecutors. 'This is a historic
scandal. I believe it will turn the history of Japanese politics,' Mr
Mikazuki said. The LDP ruled Japan for 38 years but lost its majority in
general elections last year, ceding power to a coalition headed by Premier
Morihiro Hosokawa.
'This is a very serious matter for our party,' the LDP parliamentary
business manager Mr Sadatoshi Ozato said.
The LDP has launched a campaign against Mr Hosokawa, attacking him for
bungling the economy, botching a US-Japan trade summit meeting and failing
to settle divisions within his coalition. Mr Nakamura's status in the
once-dominant party might explain why prosecutors singled him out first
among 12 national politicians said to be on their list.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Nigeria currency allocation cut
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nigeria's acute foreign exchange shortage forced the country's central bank
yesterday to cut its weekly allocation of hard currency, prompting fears
that the government's foreign exchange policy will lead to declining
production, profitability and investment.
The Central Bank of Nigeria's second allocation this year of foreign
exchange to industry fell from Dollars 200m (Pounds 111m) a fortnight ago to
Dollars 100m.
Foreign exchange has been in short supply since December 1992; some
manufacturers say stocks of raw materials and spare parts have been
declining and replacement or new plant is overdue. The 10-week gap between
the last allocation in 1993 and the first in 1994 worsened the problem.
Bankers say the expected average of Dollars 50m a week will remain well
below demand.
Bulk orders of spare parts or raw materials can be scaled down in
proportion, but this is little use when importing costly capital goods.
Importers can no longer make up the difference with export proceeds sold at
market rates. Prospective foreign investors have been deterred by the new
policy, which has ruled out agreement with official external creditors.
'This is a very serious situation,' a leading manufacturer warned yesterday.
'We have had a disruption of almost three months, then a new system which is
not working well enough. No reasonable stock cover can cope with continuing
under-supply of foreign exchange. Businesses are already thinking of scaling
down production by April.'
In the first budget presented by Gen Sani Abacha, Nigeria's military leader,
the government in January set out to ensure an adequate supply of currency
to industry and control inflation.
Like last year's currency auctions, the allocation is pro rata according to
demand, which encourages inflated applications. The 1994 budget pegged the
exchange rate at N22 to the dollar, more than double the value of the black
market naira, banned the open foreign exchange market and cut interest rates
to 21 per cent, less than a quarter of the estimated inflation rate.
Some manufacturers say the CBN is making the best of a difficult situation.
It has fought off pressure for ministers or civil servants allocating all
forex direct to each end-user. This would have taken Nigeria back to the
days of export licensing in the 1980s.

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The cost of long-term funds for Japan's hard-pressed corporate borrowers is
to rise, despite the central bank's policy of keeping official interest
rates at a record low.
The Industrial Bank of Japan, the leading long-term credit bank, yesterday
announced it will raise its long-term lending rate to its most credit-worthy
corporate clients by 0.6 percentage points to 4.4 per cent from tomorrow,
the second increase in two months.
Other commercial banks are expected to follow suit and raise interest rates
on long-term loans next month. IBJ's long-term prime rate is regarded as a
benchmark for the industry. Its 0.3 percentage point rise to 3.8 per cent in
February ended an eight-month decline in long-term rates, arousing concern
at the Bank of Japan. The central bank is under increasing pressure to cut
its 1.75 per cent official discount rate to stimulate flagging demand.
Yesterday's move will intensify fears that the Japanese economy's capacity
to recover might become hampered by a lending squeeze. Even before the
latest rise, companies told an IBJ survey that they planned to cut capital
investment this year for the third year running, the longest decline since
the second world war.
IBJ's decision reflects a recent rise in the long-term bond yields, due to a
fall in prices caused by an oversupply in the Japanese government bond
market and the rise in US interest rates. Japan's bond market has faced a
huge sell off recently, as investors locked in profits ahead of the March
book closing.
The turmoil on global bond markets and fears of an increase in bond supply
to finance the economic package and tax cuts announced last month, has
exacerbated the fall.
The Bank of Japan has become increasingly worried that the rise in corporate
lending rates will hurt corporate earnings, hampering economic recovery.
To ease the downturn in the government bond market, it has led short-term
money market rates lower over the past few weeks and the yield spread
between the discount rate and the overnight call rate is currently at a
historical low.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Christopher attacks China over human rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China and the US yesterday toughened their war of words on China's human
rights record, souring the atmosphere for this week's visit to Beijing by Mr
Warren Christopher, US secretary of state.
Mr Christopher, using his harshest language so far about China, expressed
'strong distaste' over Beijing's recent harassment of dissidents and said
the security sweep would have a 'negative effect' on his visit and on the US
review of China's favourable trade status.
China lashed back at criticism from President Bill Clinton and earlier
remarks by Mr Christopher about the arrests of three dissidents and the
overnight interrogations of at least 12 more, calling the US complaints
'irresponsible'. Beijing police, only hours later, showed they were not
deterred by US criticism by taking away Mr Wang Dan, a student leader of the
1989 Tiananmen protests, for questioning. He was later released.
Asked to comment on Mr Clinton's criticism of the recent detention of
leading dissidents, a Chinese Foreign Ministry official said: 'No foreign
country, organisation or individual has the right to make irresponsible
remarks or interfere'.
Mr Clinton said last week after China's leading dissident, Mr Wei Jingsheng,
was detained that 'we strongly disapprove of what was done and it is
obviously not helpful to our relations'. Mr Christopher, who is visiting
Australia, has said that human rights issues will top the agenda of his
talks in Beijing with China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.
China last week provoked an international outcry when it began rounding up
dissidents including Mr Wei who served more than 14 years in jail for his
role in the 'democracy wall' protests of the late 1970s.
Mr Christopher's visit to China comes at a delicate moment in Sino-US
relations; a decision is pending on renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation
(MFN) status in the US market. Mr Clinton has demanded 'progress' on human
rights before agreeing to renew MFN. A decision is due by June on the lower
tariff regime for an estimated 96 per cent of Chinese products entering the
US.
China has repeatedly denounced attempts to link trade and human rights, and
this is certain to be Beijing's prevailing message this weekend. 'Human
rights and MFN are completely separate issues. We strongly oppose linking
them,' Mr Qian said recently.
The authorities seem to fear that dissidents will use the National People's
Congress or Mr Christopher's visit to bring their cause to international
notice by circulating petitions calling for increased political freedom.
The Public Security Bureau, in a rare public statement, denied it was
intimidating dissidents. It said Mr Wei and Mr Wang Dan were not in
detention. Only Mr Zhou Guogiang (a labour leader and lawyer), Mr Yuan
Hongbing (a lawyer), and Mr Wang Jiaqi had been detained and were 'being
investigated'.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Steel manufacturers suffer an identity crisis: An industry
embarrassed at having to omit dividends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For Japan's steel companies, which pride themselves on being the pillar of
the country's industrial might, being forced to pass their dividend is an
embarrassment they have not had to suffer since just after the Second World
War.
'We must grit our teeth and do our best,' Mr Matao Kojima, executive vice
president of Sumitomo Metal Industries said yesterday after an announcement
by the five big steelmakers that they all expected to incur losses in the
year to the end of this month.
The steel industry has found itself in these dire circumstances just four
years after production levels reached a peak of 110m tonnes. At the time,
the strength of demand from Japan's surging domestic economy was enough to
halt fundamental restructuring programmes the industry had embarked on to
cut overcapacity and prepare for leaner years ahead.
With those reforms left incomplete, the industry has suffered a crippling
slump in demand from its big customers in the domestic motor vehicle,
electronics and construction industries as Japan's economy has continued its
relentless slowdown.
The weakness of consumer demand and the yen's sharp rise took their toll on
the motor and electronics industries which in turn depressed demand for the
steelmakers' products. Meanwhile, in the construction sector, private
activity, with the general exception of private housing, has been slack.
On the export front, Japanese steel makers have faced pressure in the US as
a result of anti-dumping action by the American industry. Even before the US
authorities made any official decision, fears of anti-dumping action had led
to uncertainty about supplies. Baring Securities estimates exports to the US
over the year will be down about 25 per cent.
Even a relatively bright spot - the surge in exports to China - will not
have the uplifting impact on earnings that might have been hoped for. While
exports to China will be up about 100 per cent from a year ago, when
Japanese exports to that country had reached a record high, these have been
low value-added products which served not so much to raise profits as to
keep the facilities of Japanese mills on stream.
Perhaps the most telling illustration of the severity of the steel makers
business slump is the securities sales they are being forced to make to
minimise their losses. The companies are having to turn their backs on their
traditional ties, cemented by equity holdings, with financial institutions
and business customers and to sell at a time when share prices are low.
Nippon Steel will sell about Y66bn (Pounds 420m) worth of securities
holdings and Kobe Steel some Y31bn.
To cope, the companies are reviewing ambitious diversification moves - into
areas ranging from semiconductor production to liquor importing and flying
instruction. Nippon Steel has pulled out of loss-making notebook computer
sales while Kawasaki Steel is in negotiations to sell its silicon wafer
production venture. More changes in non-core business plans are expected to
follow.
Costs are being attacked widely through significant cuts in jobs, capital
expenditure and distribution. Kobe Steel intends to cut its labour force by
about 3,800 while Kawasaki Steel will reduce 30 per cent of its managers.
While in large part, job reductions will be achieved through natural
attrition and transfers to subsidiaries 'there are no sacred territories in
our bid to reduce costs', Sumitomo's Mr Kojima said yesterday.
Japan's steel companies have yet to address the structural problem of
overcapacity which is at the root of their difficulties and is likely to
maintain pressure on profits. While the Japanese steel industry has capacity
of about 110m tonnes, even the steel companies themselves admit that demand
for their products is likely to range between 90m and 95m tonnes.
'It's always the most terrifying, the most expensive thing that is left to
the very end,' says Mr Stephen Wolfe, steel analyst at Baring Securities.
The Japanese steel companies have concentrated their efforts on cutting
people, or raising production efficiencies, but that does not address the
fundamental problem of collapsing prices, Mr Wolfe notes. For that, it is
necessary to reduce capacity 'and to make sure people are scrambling for
steel.'
While any moves to cut capacity were virtually ruled out by Nippon Steel,
which, as industry leader, has historically set a model for the others, Mr
Wolfe is not counting out the possibility that the four other companies may
be considering such a move. Their decision to pass their dividend in spite
of Nippon Steel's determination to pay one may be an indication that the
mighty Nippon Steel is losing its leadership, he believes.
If that is the case, and Japanese steel makers are preparing to map out a
more independent course, each for their own survival, the industry could
emerge from its present predicament in much better shape.
While they face growing competition from South Korean and other low cost
producers at the lower end of the market, their ability to produce high
quality products, such as cold-rolled steel sheet used in the car industry,
remains unchallenged.
'The future of steel as a product is not over,' says Mr Kojima. 'In terms of
technology Japan outdoes the rest. As long as we are competitive we can
survive.'

FT  09 MAR 94 / Israelis in court over share scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Three Israeli bank officials appeared in a Tel Aviv magistrates' court
yesterday in connection with a share and bond price manipulation scandal on
the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.
They are the latest in a line of brokers and fund managers to be
interrogated since a big investigation of alleged insider trading and share
manipulation was revealed last month by the Israel Securities Authority.
Many more are said to be under investigation.
The unfolding of what is potentially the biggest share manipulation scandal
since the 1983 bank shares collapse has sent jitters across the stock
market, which has plummeted this year.
The worst affected stocks have been the smaller capitalised companies quoted
on the Karam index, which are more easily subject to manipulation. Since the
middle of January the Karam index - which had a powerful bull run last year
 -has plunged about 27 per cent while the Mishtanim two sided index of the
100 heavily capitalised companies has fallen about 12.5 per cent.
Mr David Rosenberg, a market analyst at Pacific Mediterranean Investments,
said yesterday that in the short-term the investigation was having a marked
downward effect on the market.
However, he said the investigation would have a long-term benefit because
'it improves the credibility of the market. The key thing in any securities
market is that traders feel they are operating on a level playing field.
Enforcement by the Securities Authority will be especially good for foreign
investors.'
Israeli police said yesterday they had arrested four out of five leaders of
anti-Arab groups wanted in a government crackdown on Jewish militants since
the Hebron massacre, Reuter adds from Jerusalem.

An official European observer team yesterday condemned Monday's
parliamentary elections in ex-Soviet Kazakhstan, saying the system of
preventing abuses was flawed and government-sponsored candidates enjoyed a
built-in advantage, Steve LeVine reports from Alma Ata.
The team, representing the Council for Security and Co-operation in Europe,
stopped short of calling the elections rigged. But it said election
procedures allowed such abuses as ballot-box stuffing, and that the
pre-election campaign handicapped independent candidates.
The election was to fill a new 177-member parliament that will replace a
larger legislative body dissolved in December.

King Hussein of Jordan led a delegation to Saudi Arabia yesterday, on his
first visit to the kingdom since relations deteriorated because of the
1990-1991 Gulf crisis, James Whittington writes from Amman.
Jordan's media reported the king had left for Saudi Arabia to perform the
Ummra, a minor Moslem pilgrimage. But officials acknowledged he was seeking
a meeting with King Fahd. One western diplomat in Amman described the trip
as 'significant'.
It demonstrated Jordan's desire to achieve a rapprochement with the Saudis,
still bitter over King Hussein's refusal to back the US-led effort to force
Iraq out of Kuwait in early 1991.

The Dutch government has dropped controversial plans to tax the profits of
companies operating mobile phone networks. It is instead considering
charging mobile phone operators for the use of radio frequencies.
Koninklijke PTT Nederland, the state-owned telecoms operator, plans to
launch a European GSM standard mobile communications network in July, and a
second operator will be chosen by tender in late 1994. Mrs Hanja
Maij-Weggen, public works minister, said consortia bidding for licences
would be informed that Dutch policies on radio frequencies were under review
and subject to change. However, legislation on the use of frequencies is not
expected in time for the opening of bidding in the autumn, because of
general elections on May 3. Several international consortia, grouped around
the three main Dutch banks, ABN Amro, ING and Rabobank, are expected to
compete for the second operator's licence.

Europe's information technology industry suffered its worst year in 1993,
and has only limited prospects for growth next year, according to a report
from the European Information Technology Observatory, the commission's
co-ordinating group for IT. Growth in the European IT market was 2 per cent
in 1993, down from annual growth of 15 per cent five years ago. EITO said
faster deregulation and a harmonisation of standards were essential to allow
European groups to compete on equal terms with US companies. The US market
grew by 7 per cent last year and now accounts for 37 per cent of the world
market. Japan accounts for 16 per cent, compared with the EU's 29 per cent.
However, with new markets opening up in eastern Europe and in technological
fields straddling telecommunications and IT, EITO predicted that the
Ecu262bn (Pounds 198bn) European IT market could grow by around 3.6 per cent
in 1994.

The Hungarian parliament yesterday voted to force secret police agents and
informers to retire from public life, with the threat of exposure if they do
not. The move is part of a 'justice' campaign by the right-wing government,
designed to focus attention on the Socialists' past wrongdoings, ahead of
elections on May 8. Mr Gyula Horn (left) the Socialist leader, has a
commanding personal lead over Prime Minister Peter Boross in the opinion
polls. However, Mr Horn served in the workers' militia that helped Soviet
troops put down the 1956 uprising against communist rule. The new
legislation targets members of this organisation as well as the secret
police. The government has also begun arresting people accused of war crimes
during the uprising and is to vet newspaper editors, believing the media to
be 'dominated' by former communists.

The International Labour Organisation is set to abandon its long-standing
opposition to private employment agencies following publication of a report
recommending reform of ILO Convention 96. After pressure from the European
Commission, several European countries, in particular Germany and Spain, are
abandoning their tight controls on private agencies. However Italy and
Greece continue to ban them completely. It may be several years before the
ILO formally abandons Convention 96 - which, in 1949, recommended abolition
of fee-charging employment agencies. But the report, written by Mr Sergio
Ricca, and endorsed by the ILO secretariat, is a significant step towards
phasing out the convention. Traditionally, opposition to private agencies is
based on hostility to the idea of private companies making money out of
unemployment and on the fear that state agencies will be left with
hard-to-place workers.

The two parties in France's ruling coalition, the Gaullist RPR and the
centre-right UDF, yesterday negotiated a common policy platform for this
June's European elections, ending the threat of rival electoral lists, which
would have split the government of Mr Edouard Balladur. The coalition, which
is expected to be approved by the parties' leaders later today, is likely to
win up to 40 per cent of the vote, according to opinion polls, making it by
far the largest force. The opposition Socialists are expected to take less
than 20 per cent in a divided left-wing field. But the coalition has yet to
decide who should head their common list, or whether their Euro-MPs will sit
in the same political grouping at Strasbourg. Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing's
UDF has been trying to persuade the RPR to join it in the Christian Democrat
grouping known as the European People's Party. Until now, the Gaullists have
sat together with Ireland's conservative Fianna Fail party in a separate
group, while deputies from the UDF have been split between the Liberal and
EPP groups.

FT  09 MAR 94 / From rich city to Germany's poor-house: David Waller visits
Schweinfurt, symbol of a loss of manufacturing industry's competitive edge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Within two years the city of Schweinfurt in northern Bavaria has gone from
being one of western Germany's most prosperous cities to one of its poorest.
From having a surplus of jobs, it now has 17 per cent unemployment, the
highest in Bavaria and far above the 8.8 per cent for western Germany as a
whole.
'Germany's poor-house' and 'city of Angst' are just two of the labels which
have stuck to the small city of 53,000 inhabitants since its troubles
attracted the attention of the national media. Schweinfurt, close to the
border with the former East Germany, has become a symbol of what can happen
when western Germany's manufacturing industry loses its competitive edge.
'The crisis in this city is worse than elsewhere in Germany,' comments Mr
Erwin Saal, head of the works' council at FAG Kugelfischer, the big
ball-bearings manufacturer which has been the mainstay of employment in the
city for more than a century. 'But at the same time it is symptomatic of the
hangover German industry has brought upon itself after more than 10 years of
unbroken growth.
'In that time wages rose rapidly and the working week became the shortest in
the world. As a result we have structural problems overlayed with deep
recession - and nowhere in Germany is that more obvious than in
Schweinfurt.'
The city's past prosperity, and its current problems, are a result of the
local economy's dependence on three big employers: Kugelfischer and SKF, two
ball-bearings giants, and Fichtel &amp; Sachs, the manufacturer of clutches,
shock-absorbers and other vehicle components and which is part of the
Mannesmann engineering conglomerate.
In the years since the Second World War the three acted as a magnet for
employment throughout the Franconia region of northern Bavaria. The city's
tax revenues, drawn from the big three's profits, were the largest in the
prosperous state of Bavaria after Munich and Ingolstadt.
But more recently the big three have suffered - in especially acute form -
the combination of high wage costs and the intensified competition from
foreign manufacturers that has hit German industry so hard.
While the city's tax revenues have vanished, the companies' response to
plunging order-books has been a wave of job-cuts on a scale never before
seen in Schweinfurt. In the past two years about 7,000 people have lost
their jobs.
The lay-offs at Kugelfischer have been especially traumatic. Since it came
to the brink of collapse in January last year, the family-controlled company
has reduced its total employees from 31,000 to 15,700 and sold off 13
subsidiaries. In Schweinfurt the group cut its workforce by 43 per cent,
from 8,172 at the end of 1992 to 4,671 at the beginning of February this
year.
'Nowhere in Germany has a company gone through so radical a restructuring,'
says chief executive Mr Peter-Jurgen Kreher. (The plans for the
rationalisation were drawn up by Mr Kajo Neukirchen, more recently called in
to sort out Metallgesellschaft, the deeply troubled Frankfurt conglomerate.)
Kugelfischer's role as a provider of life-time employment from one
generation of Schweinfurters to the next was smashed overnight.
'If someone had said two years ago that Kugelfischer would suffer this kind
of fate, you would have been laughed out of court,' reflects Mr Ernst Lang,
head of the work's council at the Swedish-owned SKF, where the workforce has
shrunk by nearly a quarter to 4,460 in the past two years. 'I still don't
think people here in Schweinfurt realise how serious it is. They are hopeful
that something will turn up.'
Many of those laid off were sent into early retirement and even those who
were made redundant received generous pay-offs - in some cases as much as
DM150,000 (Pounds 58,365). Mr Lang believes that many in Schweinfurt are
suffering from an illusion of prosperity and that the real problems - and
real poverty - will emerge in a few years when the pay-outs have been
exhausted.
'The rude awakening has yet to come,' agrees Mrs Gudrun Grieser, a former
English teacher who has been the city's mayor since 1992. 'I have no
illusions: the jobs we have lost by the thousand will only be replaced by
the dozen.'
She warns about painting the picture too black, praising the skills of the
city's well-trained workers and explaining how she has persuaded Bavaria's
state government to commit DM100m to promote small business in the
Schweinfurt region. 'But the money can't be used - there just aren't enough
worthwhile projects to invest in,' she says.
The problem for Schweinfurt is that the incentives it can offer to draw new
businesses into the region are nowhere near as generous as those on offer in
the former East Germany, just 30 miles away. 'After reunification the Ossis
(east Germans) used to drive over here in their Trabants looking for jobs,'
muses Mr Fritz Glombowski, deputy head of SKF's works' council. 'Soon it'll
be the other way round and we'll be commuting to Thuringia.'

<TEXT>
Germany's economy will grow by 1.5 per cent in 1994, according to a report
published today by one of Germany's five key economic institutes. It said
strong demand for exports and further investment would help lift the economy
out of its worst post-war recession, even though domestic orders might
continue to slide. Low wage deals should improve the prospects for economic
growth, with lower interest rates helping to counteract their effect on
consumer demand. Unemployment was likely to remain constant in 1994 and
1995, falling only in 1996, but a significant fall in the numbers on
short-time working was expected before then, the report said. Mr Gunter
Rexrodt, economics minister, said in January that the economy would grow by
between 1.0 and 1.5 per cent this year, but DIW, another think-tank, said
the economy would shrink by 0.5 per cent.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Economic Watch: German unemployment rises
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
German unemployment rose slightly in February to a new post-war record of
4.04m, from the previous record of 4.03m in January. The pan-German
unemployment rate was 10.5 per cent of the workforce. In western Germany the
rate rose to 8.9 per cent in February, from 8.8 per cent in January, while
the eastern German rate rose to 17.1 per cent, from 17.0 per cent in
January. The increase in western Germany was below analysts' expectations
and represented a slowing in the rate of increase. Unusually poor weather in
the second half of February may also have contributed to the rise. However,
revised figures for Germany's fourth-quarter gross domestic product showed a
fall of 0.5 per cent from the previous quarter and a drop of 0.9 per cent
from a year earlier.
Seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in the European Union was 10.9 per
cent in January, up from a revised 10.8 per cent in December and 10.0 per
cent in January 1993. Among the under-25s, EU unemployment reached 21.1 per
cent in January, up from 19.3 per cent in January 1993.
Italy's private Isco economic research body forecast Italian GDP growth of
between 1.2 and 1.3 per cent in 1994. The government target is 1.6 per cent,
but Italy's chief accountant said the Isco forecast was realistic.
Swiss car imports rose by 16.3 per cent in February 1994 to 21,521 cars,
from 18,512 in February 1993. Total car imports for the first two months of
1994 came to 42,179, up 9.5 per cent from 38,531 in the same period of 1993.

<TEXT>
The US, anxious to run ahead of pressure from its Nato allies to send ground
troops to Bosnia, is speeding up its search for a political settlement for
the former Yugoslavia.
Mr Charles Redman, its special envoy, yesterday met President Slobodan
Milosevic of Serbia in an effort to draw the Bosnian Serbs into last week's
federation agreement between Bosnian Croats and Moslems. He later met
President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia in Zagreb.
Tomorrow, Mr Cyrus Vance, the former United Nations peace mediator, will
meet Mr Theodoros Pangalos, the Greek foreign minister, in Geneva to try to
resolve Greece's dispute with neighbouring Macedonia.
Mr Redman's talks in Belgrade reflect Washington's belief that participation
of the Bosnian Serbs is crucial for securing stability in Bosnia and for
putting together a broader agreement.
'We need to engage the Bosnian Serbs in order to put something together that
would represent an overall settlement,' said Mr Redman. UN and US diplomats
yesterday said the issue for the Bosnian Serbs was the status they would
have if they accepted the federal plan. The accord envisages a federation of
Bosnian Croats and Moslems linked with Croatia through a confederal
structure.
UN diplomats have warned Bosnian Serbs that if they reject the Washington
agreement, then 70 per cent of the territory they hold would be 'placed in
limbo'.
'It would not be recognised by the international community and we would not
sanction any union of Serbia with eastern Bosnia,' a senior UN negotiator
said.
In an effort to bring the Serbs to the negotiating table, diplomats stressed
that the Bosnian Croat/Moslem federation was aimed neither at isolating the
Serbs, nor at providing an instrument to launch a spring offensive against
Serbs in eastern Bosnia.
Any concessions by the Bosnian Serbs and Croatia would involve:
The Bosnian Serbs ceding territory in eastern Bosnia, and agreeing to lift
the sieges of the Moslem-held enclaves of Gorazde, Zepa, and Srebrenica.
Mr Milosevic and Mr Tudjman agreeing on the status of Serb-held territories
in Croatia. Croatia agreeing to grant extensive autonomy to Serbs in
south-western and eastern Croatia in return for Zagreb regaining control
over the republic. But it is far from certain if Mr Milosevic could, or
wants to persuade the Serb leadership in Croatia to accept this proposal
since the war has radicalised them.
A Spanish aircraft enforcing the Bosnian no-fly zone was hit by ground fire
over Croatia yesterday and four passengers were slightly injured, Reuter
reports from Naples. The CASA-212 logistics aircraft had to make an
emergency landing at Rijeka airport on Croatia's Adriatic coast.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Ruhe rejects more cuts in defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, yesterday warned against
further cuts in defence spending following a report by the parliamentary
ombudsman saying soldiers were demoralised and bewildered by equipment
shortages and confusion about the role of the German army.
Mr Alfred Biehle, the ombudsman who visited troops throughout Germany, said
there was a 'discrepancy' between objectives set out for the armed forces
and means available to meet them.
Soldiers on exercise were now shouting 'bang, bang' to simulate the sound of
rifle fire because bullets were too costly, the report said. Far-reaching
cuts in defence spending have aggravated problems arising from the fusion of
the West German Bundeswehr and the former East German Volksarmee.
'The fact that budget commitments and structural decisions have been
cancelled or changed in quick succession has shattered the credibility and
leadership ability of the political and military commanders,' Mr Biehle
wrote in his annual report.
'Soldiers expect, with right, that politicians clearly tell the German
population why it needs a Bundeswehr in the future and what sort of an
extended objective it will have.'
Falling morale in the armed forces has meant more people were refusing
national service and the number of conscientious objectors in 1993 shot up
to 111,190, up from 60,269 three years earlier.
The Bundeswehr Association, to which more than 250,000 soldiers belong,
welcomed Mr Biehle's report, saying it highlighted longstanding 'anxieties
and problems in the armed forces'.
The growing number of professional soldiers who had been retired to meet
savings targets meant the Bundeswehr had almost reached its reduced target
of 370,000 men.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Balladur declares war on Franglais: A new law will lead the
Gallic offensive against English and its bastard child
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur yesterday declared himself ready to do
battle on behalf of French. Inaugurating a new term of office for the
'Higher Council of the French Language', he told its 29 members that
safeguarding French was 'a political priority' of his government.
It is now quite clear that under Mr Balladur, a man whose love of
subjunctives (used in expressions of hope or fear) perfectly expresses his
nuance style of government, France will soon have a new language law, along
the lines of the draft already prepared by Mr Jacques Toubon, the culture
minister.
Behind the government's Gallic counter-offensive, of course, lie both hope
and fear. Its hope is to capitalise on its recent Gatt success in protecting
France's system of subsidising and protecting its film industry, in a way
that will prove politically popular in next year's presidential election. Mr
Toubon happens to be the keenest supporter of Mr Jacques Chirac, Mr
Balladur's rival for the Elysee.
The government's fear is that if it does not act soon to stem the rising
tide of English or its bastard child, Franglais, it will be too late. The
storm clouds are gathering from the north, with the imminent arrival of
English-prone Scandinavians into the European Union threatening to tilt the
linguistic balance in Brussels decisively in favour of Shakespeare's tongue
and against that of Racine.
Mr Toubon's aides are quick to point out that their new bill is not like
Quebec's controversial language law which banned the public use of any other
language but French. Rather, they say, it is designed to ensure that French
citizens, employees, and consumers get their information in French, though
it may be accompanied by a foreign translation.
The bill is aimed at beefing up the provisions of a 1975 language law, which
has been widely flouted, say Mr Toubon's aides, partly because the penalties
of FFr300 (Pounds 34) to FFr600 for breaking it are now only the equivalent
of a Paris parking fine. Since 1975, some 100-200 individuals and companies
a year have been fined, mainly for labelling products or advertising jobs in
a language other than French. In addition to sharply raising the level of
fines, the new bill would enable associations de defence de la langue
francaise to take those who infringe the law directly to court.
Mr Toubon's ministry has two particular targets in its sights. One is what
it believes, apparently from employees' letters of complaints, is the
growing tendency of French companies to issue instructions to their French
staff in France in other languages. An unscientific check with some of
France's biggest companies, such as the Alcatel group which does less than
30 per cent of its business inside France, is that some respond in English,
either to boost their international image or to make their frequent foreign
clients feel more at home.
But issuing internal instructions in English to French staff - says Air
Liquide, the industrial gas group, which is suspected by Mr Toubon's
ministry of doing just that - would be mad 'because it makes good sense to
communicate in a language that is understood'.
The second and more substantive target of the Toubon bill is conferences,
which would henceforth have to provide translation into French. This may
pose problems for the French scientific community which increasingly works
in English, the international lingua franca of exact science.
France's Academy of Science came out formally in January against any attempt
to legislate in this field.
But Mr Michel Crozon, a physicist who also serves as director of
communications for the CNRS, the body which funnels state money into French
science, says real damage to French scientists' ability to communicate with
their brethren abroad would only occur if the former were forced to publish
in French.
Paris's famous medical research body, the Institut Pasteur, caused a
domestic rumpus in 1989 by switching the titles of its publications into
English, in recognition of the fact that less than 10 per cent of the
manuscripts it was receiving from abroad were in French.
But it now also publishes a purely French journal as well as 'encouraging'
Anglophone authors to provide French precis of their articles - as indeed
does the Academy of Scienceas a matter of course in its publications.
Imposing French, of course, begs the question of what is French. That is a
matter for the Academie Francaise, set up in 1635 to guard the language,
and, more recently for 'terminology committees' set up by each ministry.
Both are having a struggle to keep up with the advance of other languages,
chiefly English.
The Academie Francaise has reached the letter 'F' in revising its
dictionary, while the ministerial committees invent 200-300 new approved
Gallicisms each year.
But the new terms have an equal struggle entering popular usage; certainly
the sports ministry's prescription of a 'corner' kick in football as a coup
de pied du coin has not.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia and the International Monetary Fund resume crucial loan negotiations
in Moscow today with both their reputations on the line, Reuter reports from
Washington. Moscow wants IMF endorsement of its credentials as a pro-reform
government, while the Fund is seeking to justify its position as lead
manager in helping Russia remake its economy in the capitalist mould.
Reaching agreement will not be easy. International monetary sources rate the
chances of the two sides striking a deal on an economic reform programme
that the IMF could back with a Dollars 1.5bn loan as no better than 50-50.
Moscow's commitment to reform has been questioned following the departure of
key reformers from the government in January, and the IMF has found itself
criticised by the US and others for not doing enough to encourage Russian
reforms. The IMF has already lent Russia Dollars 2.5bn, but has held back
further credits because of doubts about Moscow's willingness to press ahead
with economic reforms.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Focus on Charles Redman, US special envoy to Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Charles Redman, 50, the US special envoy to the region appointed last
August, and now the pivotal player in the peace process, spends his time
commuting between Zagreb, Sarajevo, Serbia and Vienna, where Bosnian Croats
and Moslems and Croatian officials are trying to put flesh on a preliminary
federal plan for Bosnia, writes Judy Dempsey.
'When he first sat in on the Geneva talks, I think he was overwhelmed by the
complexity of the issues,' a senior UN official said. 'He listened. He
learned. Washington could get its fingers burnt just like the Europeans.' Mr
Redman is trying to avoid this by making sure no lines are crossed. He is on
the phone constantly to Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's envoy to the former
Yugoslavia, the German Foreign Ministry, and the UN.
'Redman wants to capitalise on the momentum for peace. If it comes, he'll
have a hard time convincing Congress to send ground troops to keep that
peace,' a US diplomat said.
Sceptics believe Mr Redman, former ambassador to Sweden and state department
spokesman, does not have enough political clout, but he leans on his
contacts at the intelligence department of the US air force and at Nato,
where he served in the 1970s and 1980s respectively.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Euro Disney edges closer to Pounds 1.3bn rescue deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Euro Disney, the leisure group, and Walt Disney, its US parent company, are
understood to have mapped out the basic framework for a FFr12bn (Pounds
1.37bn) restructuring plan with Euro Disney's banks. They are optimistic
that an outline rescue can be agreed before the March 31 deadline.
The main components of the deal are expected to be a FFr6bn rights issue and
a FFr4bn reduction in Euro Disney's financial costs through a combination of
the banks' reducing their interest charges on its debt and Disney's waiving
entitlement to fees and royalties. The remaining FFr2bn would come from a
series of smaller measures such as asset transfers.
Euro Disney is owned 49 per cent by Disney of the US. The remaining 51 per
cent is publicly quoted.
'There's still some way to go and all the details have yet to be ironed
out', said a senior banker involved with the negotiations.
Once a preliminary deal has been agreed, it will take at least three months
to be completed. Disney is committed to bankrolling Euro Disney until March
31 but is understood to be willing to extend its support beyond that
deadline if the banks have agreed in principle to a deal.
A team of senior Disney executives, advised by Lazard Freres in New York,
has moved to Paris and will stay until the deal has been agreed. It is
holding regular negotiating sessions with the banks' steering committee, led
by Banque Indosuez and Banque Nationale de Paris.
Both sides have agreed that a rights issue will form the core of the
restructuring plan. Disney will take up its full entitlement of the issue,
maintaining its stake, and some of the creditor banks may act as
underwriters.
The two camps are still arguing over the precise terms of the proposed
reduction in Euro Disney's financial costs.
At present, Disney is entitled to royalties on 10 per cent of Euro Disney's
admissions and 5 per cent of food and souvenir sales. The banks are pressing
it to waive the royalties or reduce them to a token level. Disney is arguing
that its royalty entitlement should eventually be reintroduced if Euro
Disney meets, or beats, certain targets.
Similarly, the banks are asking Disney to extend indefinitely its waiver of
a management fee worth 3 per cent on Euro Disney's turnover. The US group
again hopes eventually to reinstate the fee.
Once the fee and royalty issue has been settled, Disney will press the banks
for reciprocal cuts in their interest rates on a large part of Euro Disney's
debt.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Ex-envoy contradicts Hurd over aid-arms linkage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's former high commissioner to Malaysia yesterday contradicted claims
made by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, that an offer of aid for
Malaysia's Pergau dam had been 'disentangled' from sales of defence
equipment.
Sir Nicholas Spreckley told the House of Commons foreign affairs committee
that a complex mathematical formula linking the aid and defence deals in a
protocol signed in March 1988 had not been discarded by the UK government
when concluding final negotiations over aid for Malaysia.
Instead, he told MPs that the formula - which Malaysian negotiators had
insisted on when drawing up the protocol on defence sales - had determined
the UK's decision to offer about Pounds 200m to Malaysia later that year.
Sir Nicholas's testimony contradicted claims made by Mr Hurd and by Lord
Younger, the former defence secretary - who also gave evidence to the
committee yesterday - that there was no long-term linkage between aid and
defence contracts signed with the Malaysians in 1988.
The committee is investigating Britain's decision to give Malaysia Pounds
234m to help build the Pergau dam, a decision that members of the Overseas
Development Administration have described as 'a very bad buy'. It is also
examining whether ministers broke Whitehall and international guidelines by
linking aid money to defence contracts.
Last week, Mr Hurd told the committee that there had been 'a brief
entanglement' between aid and trade in a protocol signed by Lord Younger, in
March 1988.
But the foreign secretary strongly argued that ministers sought to
'disentangle' the contracts later that year, pursuing them as two distinct
projects. to avoid breaking the guidelines prohibiting linkage.
Sir Nicholas admitted yesterday that, after Lord Younger had returned from
Kuala Lumpur, ministers wanted to remove a clause in the protocol which
offered Malaysia up to 20 per cent of the Pounds 1bn sale of defence
equipment in the form of aid money.
Sir Nicholas said he advised ministers that if that clause were withdrawn,
'something had to be put in its place, something that would bear
comparison'.
He told the committee a promise of up to Pounds 200m for development
projects made in a letter of June 28 1988 to the Malaysian government was a
technical restatement of the formula in the original protocol.
Lord Younger denied that '20 per cent' had been a 'shaping figure' in
negotiations but admitted he alone had agreed to the inclusion of the aid
formula in the arms contract. In contrast to Mr Hurd, he said the protocol
did not link arms and aid, because the document had no 'executive role'. He
also said Lord Howe, then foreign secretary, had agreed that the protocol
did not make a firm commitment of aid.
Lord Younger also said he had held discussions with Foreign Office officials
on the nature of his trip before flying to Kuala Lumpur in March 1988.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Vote dispute threatens EU expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union's planned move from 12 to 16 member states faced collapse
last night, as a result of the British and Spanish refusal to countenance
any dilution of their voting rights in an expanded Europe.
Talks at foreign minister level broke up in disarray in Brussels, although
the hard bargaining will resume next Tuesday.
While the EU states were deadlocked on voting rights, they were however
within an ace of agreeing with Norway on its entry terms. Sweden, Finland
and Austria concluded their membership negotiations with the EU last week.
But none of the four newcomers can join by January 1995, as planned, unless
the voting rights issue is cleared - along with other hurdles such as
referendums in the applicant countries.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister of Germany which has emerged as the main
champion of the EU enlargement, blamed the UK for the impasse on votes. He
also warned Spain that Germany would block an increase in EU aid for
southern member states after 1995 if Madrid rejected Norway's entry because
Oslo would not allow it to catch more cod in Norwegian waters.
German and Dutch officials warned that prospects for EU enlargement were
slipping away. The European Parliament has to decide by tomorrow whether to
proceed with its approval of terms for newcomers to join. It has said it
will not approve enlargement if the British and Spanish line on votes
triumphs.
Senior EU officials were vitriolic about the UK government. They accused it
of mollifying anti-European factions in the Conservative party even though
it said EU enlargement was at the top of its European agenda. 'They want to
reintroduce the (national) veto by the back door,' one EU ambassador said.
Britain and Spain insist on retaining the existing 23 votes needed to block
EU legislation - currently out of 76 votes distributed among the 12 member
states roughly according to their size. Their partners want to shift the
'blocking minority' to 27 votes, to maintain the same percentage formula in
a Europe of 16 sharing 90 votes.
Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, proposed a compromise of moving to
27, plus a committee to study vote distribution before the EU's
constitutional review in 1996. The committee would consider British,
Spanish, Italian and German wishes for a closer link between votes and
population size.
A senior British official said: 'I can assure you there will be no
settlement except on British terms.' Mr Javier Solana, the Spanish foreign
minister, said: 'If there is no solution to this problem, we will not
unfortunately be able to celebrate what we all want - enlargement.'
Amid this test of negotiating nerve, the EU and Norway looked close to
resolving the difficulty over Spanish insistence on recovering 'historic
rights' to 7,000 tonnes of Norwegian cod in the face of Oslo's refusal to
concede a single extra fish.
A Commission formula, which both Madrid and Oslo were prepared to consider,
in effect recycles fish quotas Norway conceded when it joined the European
Economic Area free trade zone.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Increase in output strengthens hopes of steady recovery:
Pessimism over base rate cut hits shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears that the UK economic recovery might be faltering were assuaged
yesterday by news of faster-than-expected growth in manufacturing output and
industrial production in January.
The Central Statistical Office said January's manufacturing output was 1.1
per cent higher than in December, while industrial production, which
includes energy, rose by 0.8 per cent. However, the January increases are
from a lower base as the CSO reduced its estimates of output and
manufacturing production in 1993.
The output statistics depressed sentiment on the London stock market as
traders felt it made an immediate cut in base rates less likely. Shares were
also hit by falls in bond markets in Germany and the UK. The FT-SE 100 index
fell 41.5 points to close at 3,264.4.
Weak economic statistics published last month had cast doubt on the strength
of the UK recovery and revived calls for sharper base rate cuts.
Manufacturing output had been estimated to have fallen by 0.5 per cent in
December, although that has been revised to a 0.2 per cent fall. Many of the
figures appear to have been distorted by the effect of the Christmas period
and the CSO prefers to look at quarterly trends. Manufacturing output was
0.6 per cent higher in the three months to January than in the previous
three. Industrial production was 0.9 per cent higher.
'The figures confirm that the December data were erratic and that people are
still too downbeat about the prospects for economic recovery in the UK,'
said Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at Morgan Stanley, who last week
increased his forecast of this year's UK economic growth from 2.6 to 2.8 per
cent.
The government is forecasting a 2.5 per cent growth in UK gross domestic
product in 1994.
Some observers, however, believe that tax increases taking effect next month
will slow the pace of economic growth. Mr Peter Warburton of Robert Fleming
thinks a combination of higher taxes and a weak labour market will restrict
consumer spending and limit GDP growth to 1.8 per cent this year.
Yesterday's figures prompted the CSO to increase its estimates of the trend
in manufacturing output growth from 1 per cent to 2 per cent annually and
for the trend in production from 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent annual growth.
The main source for January's manufacturing output rise was the engineering
sector, notably electrical and optical equipment.
The main reason for the downward revision in estimated 1993 growth in
manufacturing output and industrial production was higher than expected
export prices. The CSO uses the inflation rate to 'deflate' output cash
totals and reach volume estimates.
As a result, manufacturing output was 1.8 per cent higher in 1993 than in
1992, down from the previous 1.9 per cent estimate, whereas 1993 industrial
production was 2.5 per cent up on 1992.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Prices cut in battle for electricity sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 7,000 large consumers of electricity are to buy from a supplier
other than their regional power company for the first time next month,
taking advantage of the opening of their market to competition.
Many more among the 45,000 power users able to shop around for supplies from
April 1 have signed deals with local distributors that will give them
significant price reductions. Eligible users include industrial concerns,
supermarkets, large schools and hospitals.
Some distributors - including Manweb, in the north-west of England and in
north Wales, and Midlands Electricity - say they have offered consumers
outside their regions price cuts of up to 20 per cent.
Most reductions fall within 4 per cent and 10 per cent. Some consumers
enjoying lower tariffs have received no immediate financial benefit.
The reductions stem from the second stage of the liberalisation of the
electricity market, which will allow users of between 100kW and 1MW at their
period of peak consumption to pick from any licensed supplier.
Until April 1 they have had to buy from their regional distributor. Only
consumers of more than 1MW had a choice of supplier. By 1998, all consumers,
including householders, will be able to select their supplier.
To take advantage of the deregulated system from April 1, eligible consumers
should already have signed contracts with a supplier, which should have
registered the arrangement with the electricity pool, through which power is
traded.
Ms Margaret McKinlay, pool chief executive, said the organisation knew of
7,300 deals involving a customer and a supplier other than their regional
distributor. 'We expect that figure to grow perhaps by about double,' she
said. Consumers can still sign deals. The pool requires 20 working days'
notice before agreements come into effect.
Most regional power companies say consumers with lower demand, perhaps 100kW
to 300kW, are less interested in shopping around. Some users in that
category complain of difficulty in persuading power companies to make
acceptable offers.
Powerline, the supply subsidiary of Midlands Electricity, says it has
targeted smaller companies and, partly as a result, has won 1,000 sites
outside its area.
MEB, Northern, Eastern Electricity, East Midlands Electricity, and
generators PowerGen and National Power are said to be among the most active
in the market.

weak markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Esselte, the Swedish office products group, swung to a SKr301m (Dollars
38.1m) pre-tax profit in 1993 from a SKr11m loss a year earlier, in spite of
weak conditions in many important markets. The dividend is SKr2.75 per
share, up from SKr2.50.
The turnround was flattered by the exclusion of SKr270m in one-off costs
which hit the final quarter of 1992. But improved market conditions in the
final quarter of 1993, particularly in the Nordic countries and the UK, also
helped. The company expects a further improvement this year.
The weaker krona was positive for the company, helping to lift sales to
SKr11.8bn from SKr9.9bn. However, the impact was mitigated by sizeable
production operations in hard currency countries such as Denmark, France,
Belgium and Germany.
Based on comparable exchange rates and units, sales were 3 per cent lower
last year, reflecting weak markets in southern and western Europe and Japan.

Losses at Puma, the German-based sports goods manufacturer which has been
reorganised, more than quintupled last year to DM68.8m (Dollars 39m)
compared with a DM12m loss in 1992.
The group blamed the costs of rationalisation measures. These gave rise to
extraordinary restructuring charges of DM60.5m at the parent company level.
Excluding licence income, turnover dropped by 11 per cent last year to
DM457.6m following DM512.8m in 1992. Including licence revenue, group
turnover rose by 1 per cent to DM1.18bn.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Pentagon bans smoking
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
After Britain's Royal Navy abandoned the rum ration, it was perhaps only a
matter of time before the US armed services stopped smoking.
That time came yesterday when the Pentagon announced a workplace smoking
ban.
The new policy will still allow soldiers and sailors to light up a cigarette
in designated areas of military barracks, clubs and restaurants, but will
rule out Pentagon offices and hallways, as well as the inside of a tank or
aircraft.
Smoking below the decks of US Navy ships has already been virtually
outlawed.
The armed forces have traditionally smoked much more than the population at
large, and despite aggressive steps to curb smoking, the rate of addiction
remains high.
Navy officials said around 37 per cent of Navy personnel were now smokers,
compared with around 27 per cent in the general US population.
The move was therefore welcomed by anti-smoking campaigners, who have been
pressing for tougher curbs on smoking in the wake of the Environmental
Protection Agency's recent decision to classify passive smoking as an
environmental hazard.
Some shopping malls and restaurant chains, including McDonald's, have banned
smoking on their premises, and legislation is being debated in Congress that
would bar cigarettes from all public buildings.
Tobacco companies also face scrutiny over reports that they add nicotine to
their products in order to maintain addiction - a charge that has led the
Food and Drug Administration to consider regulating cigarettes as a drug.
Justice Department officials are also conducting a monopoly investigation
into allegations that tobacco companies agreed to keep a cigarette which
presents less of a fire hazard off the market.
The tobacco industry, facing a steep increase in cigarette taxes as part of
US healthcare reforms, is not taking this lying down. Philip Morris, the
tobacco conglomerate, shut down one of its largest plants yesterday to bus
its workers to Washington to demonstrate against the tax rise.

FT  09 MAR 94 / Venezuelan taxes to be reformed

   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Venezuelan cabinet yesterday sent a series of tax bills to Congress
aimed at cutting the public sector deficit, which last year reached 3.6 per
cent of gross domestic product.
The bills cover several areas. A general sales tax, covering imports and
other activities at the wholesale level, is planned to replace a value added
tax brought in in October 1993.
The maximum rate for corporate and personal income taxes is being raised
from 30 per cent to 34 per cent. At the same time the number of income tax
deductions is being reduced.
Two new taxes are being proposed: a levy on all debit transactions at banks
and a luxury tax of 10, 20 or 30 per cent, depending on classifications to
be issued by the government.
Venezuela's motor industry is bracing itself for lower sales, expecting the
luxury tax to raise prices considerably on its profitable, high-priced
vehicles.
The government is proposing some changes in existing tax laws, for example
lowering high fees established last year for certain government services and
introducing stricter penalties for tax evasion. It plans to set up an
independent agency to collect taxes and reduce tax evasion, put at 70 per
cent in recent years.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Belgrade theatregoers find a respite from the war: Cheap
tickets mean capacity audiences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Huddled in scarves and overcoats, a Belgrade theatre audience intently
follows the argument between a grizzled Bosnian moneylender, played by one
of Serbia's leading actors, with an Austrian officer who wants to marry
Gago, his maid.
'The Girl with Purple Hair', set in a period of turmoil as the
Austro-Hungarian empire was collapsing, opened nearly a year ago, but
tickets are still hard to get.
Despite being shabby and unheated, Belgrade's theatres are playing to
capacity audiences for the second successive winter. With the price of a
theatre ticket still only the equivalent to buying a Coke at a Belgrade
disco, theatre is one of cheapest forms of entertainment.
Although Serbian actors and directors acquired a good reputation during the
1980s, it was only after the rump Yugoslavia was plunged into isolation by
UN sanctions 20 months ago because of the war in Bosnia that theatres
started filling up.
Mr Milan Vlajicic, arts editor of the Belgrade daily Politika, says: 'Most
people can't afford to frequent restaurants any more, and cheap theatre
tickets make it possible to have an evening out. But there's also a new,
younger audience for serious plays, just as there was during the second
world war.'
Few new films reach cinemas in Serbia and Montenegro. State-controlled
television dutifully reflects the growing nationalist influence in daily
life, showing war films during the conflict with Croatia two years ago and,
more recently, domestic soap operas with a discernibly Serb nationalist
slant in the dialogue and jokes.
Yet only one new play, 'Dark is the Night' by Alexander Popovic, Serbia's
best-known playwright, takes the war for its subject.
But for people who want to forget the grimness of daily life in the Serbian
capital, there are comedies, classics and musicals - Fiddler on the Roof and
Some Like it Hot are this season's hits.
'The Girl with Purple Hair', inspired by a short story of Ivo Andric, the
former Yugoslavia's Nobel prize-winning novelist, touches indirectly on
current issues.
Ms Vida Ognjenovic, who wrote and directed the piece, says: 'I wanted to
write something that was relevant to our problems, there was no question
about that. Even so, it had to be put in context and given some distance.'
Financial constraints mean that sets are minimal and costumes modest in
Serbian theatre productions. The costumes for 'Girl with Purple Hair' were
made from scraps of material which were collected from a leather factory
because the Belgrade municipal theatre, which staged the play, is close to
bankruptcy.
Concert tickets are also in short supply, although more than 150 of
Belgrade's leading orchestral musicians have left the country in the past
two years.
While there is no official censorship, the Socialist party of President
Slobodan Milosevic keeps a watchful eye on cultural activity.
The National Theatre, the umbrella for the former Yugoslavia's leading
theatre, ballet and opera companies, was placed under new management in 1992
after Ms Ognjenevoic, then its artistic director allowed Mr Vuk Draskovic,
the democratic opposition leader, to address his supporters from its balcony
in an anti-government demonstration.
When the municipal theatre staged a new play about St Sava, Serbia's patron
saint, which implied he had been a spoiled medieval playboy, nationalist
demonstrators disrupted the opening night.
The play was not performed again.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of Credit Management (12): Credit comes to judgment -
County court case registrations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the most effective ways of preventing bad debts from arising is to
carry out a thorough check on credit status before granting credit.
Information on the credit status of another company is readily available
from the main credit reference agencies such as CCN, Infolink, Dun &amp;
Bradstreet and Equifax.
The service provided by these agencies has become increasingly sophisticated
in recent years, as the information required by businesses trying to assess
the risk of lending money, or supplying goods and services, has changed in
response to the changing economic environment.
Clients are much more specific about the information they want and what they
are prepared to pay for, says David Coates, sales and marketing director of
CCN Business Information.
Five years ago most users bought full status reports on companies. These
days, Mr Coates adds, the agencies have to break down reports and sell the
information in different forms.
The problem of judging the credit status of the 3m-4m businesses in the UK -
mainly partnerships and sole traders - on which no audited financial
information is available, has proved particularly acute during the
recession. It prompted CCN to develop a database for unlimited companies and
to begin adapting empirical scoring techniques long used in the consumer
credit field, to help evaluate the credit worthiness of businesses.
In addition to looking at an industry sector as a whole, the payment record
of a company and any available financial data, an essential element in
building up a picture of the creditworthiness of small businesses has been
the development of a directors' database.
CCN's directors' database contains information on 6m directors and company
secretaries in the UK. With so many business failures during the recession,
this information has proved invaluable in helping banks and other companies
decide whether to lend or extend credit to start up businesses where often
the only information available on which to make an assessment of the credit
risk relates to its directors.
Most agencies now offer their services through on line computer links. This
has made checking credit information quick and simple. Furthermore, it has
helped to reduce the cost to the end user. CCN charges Pounds 25 for a
traditional full status report, but for users such as banks (which purchase
the information in bulk) the cost of a full status report is discounted to
under Pounds 10. A directors' database search costs Pounds 6 and a search of
CCN's unlimited database costs Pounds 10. Prices charged by other agencies
are comparable.
The credit reference agencies' sources of information are Companies House,
newspapers and, quite often with small companies, the company itself. But
probably their most important source of information is county court
judgments.
Since 1990 most county court judgments are immediately entered on the County
Court Register as soon as made by a court.
Entries can be cancelled when a judgment is set aside or reversed or paid in
full within one month. Judgments paid in full after one month can be noted
on the register as 'satisfied'. All entries are automatically removed after
six years.
Since 1986 the register has been run by Registry Trust Ltd, a
non-profit-making company limited by guarantee. The Register is divided into
consumer judgments and commercial judgments against businesses.
According to Malcolm Hurlston, chairman of Registry Trust, users of the
register fall into one of four categories:
Purchasers of the consumer file;
Purchasers of the commercial file;
Purchasers of the file by county or by court;
Individual inquiries from the public, either by post or in person.
When the Trust took over the running of the register from the Lord
Chancellor's Department, it had a database of 6m pieces of paper and the
cost of searching a judgment was 40p each. Through computerisation and the
establishment of a dual system for keying-in the data, which has ensured the
accuracy of the information stored, the cost of accessing the register has
come down substantially. Purchasers of the whole file now pay the equivalent
of 16p for each judgment.
Purchasers of the file of commercial judgments - which make up 18.4 per cent
of the whole file - pay Pounds 64,000 per annum. The commercial file is
currently purchased by eight agencies. Purchasers of all the consumer
judgments pay Pounds 250,000 per annum. There are currently four purchasers
of the consumer file.
The number purchasing the information by locality or by court has fallen
from a low base of 30 in 1986 to just 8 in 1994. They pay 40p per judgment.
Public inquiries cost Pounds 4.50 by post and Pounds 4 in person. There were
54,155 public inquiries in 1993, a fall of 11 per cent on the 1992 figure
and some way below the peak of almost 70,000 in 1990.
In 1993 there were just over 2m judgments registered or noted as satisfied
on the register, a fall of 12 per cent on the 1992 figure - which in turn
was a fall on the peak figure of 2.4m in 1991.
The number of commercial judgments registered but unsatisfied on the
register in 1993 was 332,265, 16 per cent down on the peak 1992 figure of
almost 400,000.
Information on High Court judgments is not available at present but would be
useful if it could be accurately collated, says Aidan Breen, operations
director of CCN Business Information.
Gathering accurate information on High Court judgments is difficult, says
Malcolm Hurlston, partly because of the large number of cases which settle
out of court with the terms of settlement remaining secret.
At best, any body (such as the Trust) which now undertook to record High
Court judgments could only offer an incomplete picture. This would be of
doubtful value to the main users of such information: the credit reference
agencies.
Irrespective of whether or not accurate information on High Court judgments
becomes available in the short term, the scope of the information available
to credit reference agencies, and to others who need assistance in deciding
whether or not to lend or supply goods and services, is increasing all the
time. The register, for example, has been extended in recent years to cover
courts in Scotland, Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man and Jersey.
The agencies have begun to collect information on individual and company
schemes of voluntary arrangement (CCN will offer an information service on
company voluntary arrangements from March 17).
And through organisations such as Internet, a network of the main credit
bureaux in Europe, information on the credit status of European companies
can now be easily accessed by exporters anywhere within the EU.
All these developments help to make pre-credit checking an increasingly
attractive and effective way of preventing the problem of bad debts.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of Credit Management (11): 'I'm keen on the
embarrassment factor' - Late payers, watch out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Strathclyde, the youthful minister of state for small firms and
consumer affairs, enjoys the thought of embarrassing companies which fail to
pay their bills on time.
He is waging his own personal battle against late payers, who have been
accused of depriving British companies of more than Pounds 50bn in cash
through unpaid invoices. If he receives a complaint from a disgruntled
supplier, 'I will send a letter to the chairman (of the debtor company),' he
says. Of course, he adds, the debtor is given a fair hearing. But
nevertheless: 'I'm keen on the embarrassment factor.'
Debate over the solution to late payment is reaching fever pitch, with
responses to a consultative document on the subject issued by the Department
of Trade and Industry expected by the end of the month. The document
followed comments by the UK Chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, in his November
budget, that failure to settle invoices on time could mean 'the difference
between survival and failure' for many UK companies.
Mr Philip Mellor, senior analyst with Dun &amp; Bradstreet, says that in annual
surveys by the credit information provider, late payment has consistently
ranked in the top three concerns of companies questioned. The Confederation
of British Industry also found, in 1991, that one in five of its smaller
members thought their survival was threatened by late payment.
But the solution is less than clear. The proposal which sparked the most
controversy has been legislation to impose a statutory right to interest on
late payments. A survey of almost 500 smaller companies by SG Warburg, the
UK brokers, last month, showed that 58 per cent of those questioned favoured
legislation. But a substantial minority - 29 per cent - opposed legislation.
The campaign to introduce statutory interest has been backed by prominent
names including Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank, and
Mr Richard Greenbury, chairman of Marks &amp; Spencer. They have all backed
proposals put forward by the Forum of Private Businesses, a vociferous lobby
group which has campaigned for legislation for about 10 years. The forum
suggests that, among other measures, companies be allowed to claim interest
on overdue invoices for up to six years, even if the main debt had been
separately collected.
Legislation, say its supporters, would end the uncertainty surrounding
payment, which plagues smaller businesses. This is particularly important,
as the economy begins to recover, to companies strapped for cash. 'We should
not allow those smaller companies, without assets to fall back upon, to be
penalised by late payment,' Mr Mellor says.
The Forum is unperturbed by sceptics who say that companies are unlikely to
pursue interest. Legislation with a six-year option would force late payers
to make provision for contingent liabilities in their accounts, says Mr
David Harrop, of the Forum. This would encourage late payers to improve
their performance.
While Lord Strathclyde himself admits that there appears to be a
considerable head of steam building up behind this option, the issue must
present a difficult dilemma for the Government. How can it increase
regulation while preaching deregulation?; When should interest charges begin
if the standard payment times vary, industry by industry? And how would the
already overloaded courts cope with an increase in cases? 'Legislation only
sounds simple if you say it quickly,' says Lord Strathclyde.
Opponents of legislation cite a variety of arguments against the proposal.
'Small companies owe money as well as are owed money,' says Mr Tim Corbett,
business development director of Barclays Commercial Services, the factoring
firm. ' If they owe money to their suppliers they will be targeted too, and
could find themselves on the losing side.'
Opponents argue that charging interest may well encourage late payment. Some
companies may decide interest provides a legitimate excuse for not paying
and 'use the supplier as an alternative source of finance,' says Mr Ben
Allen, chairman of the Association of British Factors and Discounters (see
profile, Page II).
Then there are those who cite the experience of those European countries
such as France and Germany, which have legislation, but where payment times
actually appear to be lengthening.
'I do not think legislation will make a blind bit of difference,' says Mr
John Butterworth, managing director of Royal Bank Invoice Finance, whose
parent, the Royal Bank of Scotland, actually supports legislation.
Mr Butterworth suggests that the best option would be to use the existing
system, which allows collection of interest through the courts if it has
been specified in the contract. This is a cumbersome and lengthy process,
which few companies use. The legislation being proposed would apply the
right to interest universally, irrespective of the contract. 'We would like
to avoid legislation if possible,' says Mr Mellor of Dun &amp; Bradstreet, 'but
looking at all the voluntary measures that have been put forward to date,
none has worked.'
Opponents would argue that peer pressure has been effective with some of the
UK's largest companies. 'GEC was one of the worst offenders and they have
been shamed into changing their policies,' says Mr Allen of the ABFD.
He favours the DTI's second option - a British Standard on prompt payment,
as well as measures to force companies to publish their payment times in the
annual accounts.
Need for change is is about the only issue on which all parties agree. Yet
Lord Strathclyde is wary of even that seemingly simple goal. 'However you
change the climate of late payment, you must tackle the problem of financial
management within companies - in the UK it's appalling.'

FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of US Communications (12): Tide may turn on smart
devices - 'Personal digital assistants' have not yet caught on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The goal of the mobile communications industry is to keep you in touch 'any
time, anywhere'. Whether or not this is an attractive proposition, it seems
to be the inevitable fate of many professionals in the not-too-distant
future.
Already, many are toting a bag full of communications gadgets: a cellular
telephone, a pager and a notebook computer complete with telephone modem.
Combine the functions of these products into a single device and you have a
'personal communicator'.
It seemed a sure-fire winner, but so far personal communicator products,
also known as 'personal digital assistants', have created more publicity
than profits. In fact, they have been a dismal failure.
Apple Computer's Newton was the biggest letdown. Heralded as a product that
would 'change the way people live and work', it turned out to be a product
that changed little except the names of the top management executives at
Apple. Tandy's Zoomer and AT&amp;T's Eo Communicator have also been slow
sellers.
Yet it may be too soon to write off the personal communicator. Advances in
wireless data communications and software for personal communicators promise
to make the next generation of these hand-held devices far more attractive
than the first.
Apple Computer is set to introduce a new version of Newton with improved
communications capabilities and better handwriting recognition software.
AT&amp;T, stung by the disappointing sales of the Eo Communicator, is
redesigning the system, lowering the price and transforming it into a mobile
telephone with computer features.
IBM is said to be planning a family of personal communicator products, each
designed for specific tasks. One model, for example, is equipped with voice
recognition for dictating notes. Another is designed for sending and
receiving electronic mail.
Motorola is about to enter the market with a personal communicator called
Envoy that has a built-in modem to send data both over telephone lines and
over the Ardis network. Jointly owned by Motorola and International Business
Machines, Ardis provides wireless data messaging service in all large US
metropolitan areas. Sony is also planning to launch a personal communicator
in the US this summer.
Link Resources, a US market research group, predicts a 45.7 per cent
compound annual growth rate in sales of all types of 'smart hand-held
devices' over the next five years, with more than 5m units being shipped to
business users and consumers in the US in 1998. The second generation of
personal communicators will sell well to mobile executives and in the small
office and home office markets, Link researchers predict. They anticipate
several developments that could turn the tide for this new category of
mobile communications devices. Most importantly, the market researchers
expect wireless data communications services to proliferate and become less
expensive.
At present, Ardis, a joint venture of Motorola and IBM, and Ram Mobile Data,
owned by BellSouth and RAM Broadcasting, offer wireless data networks in
large cities throughout the US.
This year new Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD) and enhanced 'specialised
mobile radio' (SMR) services - based on the networks being implemented by
McCaw Cellular and NexTel - will drive down user costs for wireless voice
and data communications, Link Resources predicts.
CDPD sends data in packets over cellular networks. 'In the simplest sense,
this technology sends blocks of information over the networks by utilising
those milliseconds when channels are idle between calls,' said Brian
Montgomery, of Cellular One, a California cellular telephone service company
that is a joint venture of McCaw Cellular and Pacific Telesis. 'It provides
the capability for a cost-effective data service because it doesn't require
expanded system capacity.'
An important advantage of CDPD is that it is an 'open' standard, developed
by a consortium of communication companies including McCaw Cellular
Communications and PacTel Cellular, based on non-proprietary technology.
This means that unlike existing wireless networks, it will be accessible to
anyone with a computer or personal communicator equipped with a CDPD modem
and that it can be integrated easily with existing software for applications
such as electronic mail. Lotus Development, the personal computer software
company, is developing software to take advantage of CDPD networks.
NexTel, a little-known six-year-old New Jersey radio dispatch service
company, burst on to the scene as a potential new competitor in the emerging
market for wireless data communications last year with its acquisition of
mobile radio spectrum rights from Motorola. Using digital technology from
Motorola, NexTel aims to create a nationwide network offering voice, data
and paging as well as its established dispatch services .
When low cost wireless data communications services are in place, personal
communicators will become really useful devices, enabling people to send or
receive written (or typed) messages, access information services or simply
use the device as a portable telephone.
Another important impetus for personal communicators may be 'intelligent
networks' such as AT&amp;T's 'PersonaLink'. Using software developed by General
Magic, a California software company in which it holds a stake, AT&amp;T plans
to introduce 'PersonaLink' this summer.
Among the features of PersonaLink is the ability to prioritise messages.
Perhaps more than anything else this may prove to be the 'must have'
attraction of personal communicators for people who are overwhelmed with
telephone, facsimile and electronic mail messages.
Instead of exacerbating this all-too-common problem by creating 'anywhere,
anytime' communications, personal communicators may actually therefore help
individuals to regain control of their personal communications.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of US Communications (14): Superhighway into the home
 -Efforts to turn couch potatoes into couch commandos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The computer, telecommunications and entertainment industries are conspiring
to turn 'couch potatoes' into 'couch commandos'; to rouse television viewers
from their passive stupor and to get them 'interacting' with the tube.
Interactive television will be the foundation of a Dollars 3,500bn digital
consumer electronics industry by the turn of the century, John Sculley, the
former chairman of Apple Computer, has predicted. The prospect is sparking a
frenzy of activity among US telephone, cable television, entertainment,
computer, software and semiconductor companies.
Hollywood and High Tech are joining forces to promote I-TV. It 'will usher
in the multimedia age, inaugurating the electronic superhighway into the
home,' enthuses Gerald Levin, chairman and chief executive of Time Warner,
the entertainment group.
'This is the 'information infrastructure' that President Clinton has talked
about,' says Richard McCormick, chairman and chief executive of US West, one
of the largest US regional telephone companies, which plans to expand its
services to include I-TV.
The multi-billion dollar question, however, is whether consumers will share
the industry's excitement about technology that transforms the living room
TV set into a 'digital interactive multimedia terminal'.
Today, fledgling I-TV services offer viewers the chance to participate in
television game shows, to call football plays before the quarterback makes
his move, order movies for instant viewing and register their opinions on
issues of the day. But is this enough to 'change the use of television' as
industry proponents maintain?
Future plans include interactive shopping channels. Picking fashions from
Nordstrom, or home furnishings from Macy's could soon become as simple as
pressing a few buttons on the remote control.
There are also grand plans for multi-media information services ranging from
restaurant guides complete with video footage of the dining-room and a
nutritional analysis of the menu, to maps that can display the most scenic
route or locations of inns along the way.
Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of I-TV, however, is the prospect of
being able to design your own TV channel, selecting all your favourite shows
and programmes reflecting your interests. You might, for example, want to
watch only a re-run of Cheers, or all news broadcasts concerning the war in
Bosnia.
But with so many different potential uses for I-TV, there is little
consensus on what are the 'killer applications' that will lure consumers to
pay for this new technology.
Games will be the 'Trojan Horse' that bring I-TV into the home, providing an
entree for information services, movies-on-demand, TV shopping and other
services, analysts at Salomon Brothers predict. 'Consumers simply are not
willing to invest the money . . . for any application but games and
'edutainment',' they say.
However, extensive consumer research conducted by Hewlett-Packard suggests
that educational applications of interactive television, aimed at children,
may be the initial attraction.
'Consumers are very shrewd. They realise that although games may have some
novelty value they are not going to hold their interest for long,' says
Casey Lumus, HP's interactive television market development manager. She
wonders, however, whether the 4,000 participants in HP's surveys, interviews
and focus groups may have been giving a 'morally correct' answer by putting
education at the top of their list of most interesting applications.
There is a widespread suspicion among market researchers that I-TV could
take off on a different note. They point out that pornographic films
established the Dollars 12bn video rentals business and that on-line romance
is a key attraction of computer information services. The same may be true
of I-TV.
While identifying the services that will persuade consumers to pay for I-TV
is difficult, market researchers have a clearer picture of what consumers do
not want. Of more than 3,000 people interviewed by H &amp; M Consulting, a
California market research firm, 94 per cent said they wanted no
solicitation on I-TV and 73 per cent said no to advertising.
Consumers are afraid of the 'Big Brother' factor. 'They fear that their
interaction habits - what they purchase, which programmes they watch and
which information services they access - will be monitored by service
providers to target advertising at them,' explains Mark Macgillivray of H &amp;
M.
This poses a huge problem, because advertising is the primary source of
revenue for the TV industry. Although advertisers relish the idea of being
able to target consumers who are likely to buy their products, it seems that
they will have to create new forms of advertising such as 'infomercials' to
catch their attention.
HP's researchers also found that consumers are concerned that I-TV will make
TV shopping too easy, leading to impulse buying. 'A surprisingly high number
of consumers said that they already 'couldn't trust' family members with
home shopping TV channels which require a phone call to order goods,' notes
Ms Lumus. 'What would happen if they could spend money just by punching a
button on a remote control?' HP's research subjects asked.
The biggest question hanging over I-TV, however, is whether people will find
the time to use it. Initial response from viewers offered 'movie-on-demand'
service has been mixed, with most consumers making little use of it.
In addition to the uncertainties of consumer response, several economic,
regulatory and technical obstacles stand in the way of widespread
availability of interactive television services.
Delivering interactive TV to the home will require huge investments in
optical fibre cables capable of carrying hundreds of different TV signals as
well as computers to control the interactive network and store massive
quantities of data for multi-media information services. Viacom, one of the
largest US cable TV operators, estimates the total industry's costs at more
than Dollars 30bn.
Cable TV and telephone companies are vying for the role of I-TV providers,
yet neither industry has networks that are well suited to the task. While
telephone networks have the two-way communication capability and
sophisticated switching systems needed for I-TV, they lack the broad band
width needed for hundreds of video signals. Cable TV networks have higher
capacity, although most will need to be upgraded for I-TV, and they are not
designed for two-way communications.
Regulatory barriers limit the activities of US telephone companies. While
the Clinton administration is backing legislation that will enable 'open
competition' in telephone and television services, many details have yet to
be worked out.
There are, as yet, no technical standards for interactive television. Early
purchasers could get stuck with the I-TV equivalent of a Betamax; the losing
contender in the video tape recording standards battle. Similarly, cable TV
operators risk choosing the wrong method of video compression, which
squeezes hundreds of digitised TV signals down a single cable.
I-TV faces competition from alternative 'interactive multimedia' products.
3DO, a Silicon Valley start-up company backed by AT&amp;T, Matsushita and Time
Warner, has launched a Dollars 700 'multimedia player' and CD-ROM
interactive programmes for PCs have multiplied the sales of PCs to home
users.
None of this has dimmed the enthusiasm of the high technology and
entertainment industries, which are banding together in a multitude of
cross-industry partnerships and alliances to position themselves for the
brave new world of I-TV. .
Among the key players, Tele-Communication and Time Warner, the two largest
US cable TV operator with a total of over 17m subscribers, are 'both
committed to transforming our cable systems into powerful networks that will
deliver a broad array of services,' says John Malo , president and chief
executive of TCI. The companies have formed a joint venture to develop
standard hardware and software for interactive TV networks.
Time Warner Entertainment and TCI are also partnering Sega America, the US
subsidiary of the Japanese video games manufacturer, to launch 'The Sega
Channel', offering Sega video game owners access to a large library of games
via cable television.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of US Communications (13): Life in tomorrow's fast
lane - Louise Kehoe discusses convergence of computers with television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Convergence has become the buzzword of the US high-technology industries as
telephone, cable television, computer and software companies all work toward
creating high-speed, broadband 'information highways' linking homes, offices
and schools.
The notion that these formerly distinct industries are melding into a giant
'information industry' has been buoyed by a plethora of partnerships and
alliances that criss-cross industry segments.
Yet it is fierce competition, rather than a meeting of minds, that is
driving rapid changes in the US communications sector and the results, at
least in the short term, may be more chaotic than cohesive.
US telephone companies are engaged in a huge battle with the cable
television industry. Similarly, the personal computer industry is pitted
against the makers of TV sets, broadcasters and all who place their bets on
TV as the primary vehicle for delivering multimedia services to the home.
As author George Gilder puts it: 'The computer industry is converging with
the television industry in the same sense that the automobile converged with
the horse.' He predicts a period of 'creative destruction' as industry
segments collide and battle over establishing their new roles.
There will be 'winnowing out' of many of the early participants in the rush
to create interactive multimedia communications services, predicts Bill
Gates, chairman and chief executive of Microsoft, the world's largest
computer software company, which this year is investing Dollars 100m - a
quarter of its research and development budget - in software for multimedia
communications services.
Just building the infrastructure for this high-speed information transport
system could cost as much as Dollars 100bn, Mr Gates estimates. Yet no one,
including the companies making these investments, really knows how the
market will develop, he warns.
This is especially evident in the transmission segment where telephone and
cable TV companies are spending heavily to upgrade networks. Due to progress
in technology and differing assumptions about customer demand, a variety of
approaches to modernisation have evolved.
To increase the capacity of networks, telephone companies are investing in
optical fibre cables. Debate continues, however, on whether the optical
fibre needs to run all the way to the kerb, serving perhaps a dozen homes,
or to neighbourhood 'hubs' serving hundreds of homes.
While Bell Atlantic, for example, favours fibre to the kerb, Pacific Bell
has adopted a 'hybrid fibre coaxial cable' approach in which fibre-optic
loops link to coaxial cables that feed telephone and TV signals to groups of
homes. US West plans to employ a combination of the two.
Cable TV companies already have coaxial cable networks in place to serve
more than 60 per cent of households. Over short distances, with digital
compression, coaxial cables rival the capacity of optical fibre, but like
the telephone companies, the cable industry must upgrade to fibre for longer
hauls. Many of the larger cable TV companies are now upgrading to hybrid
networks with optical fibre links to neighbourhoods, then coaxial cable to
individual homes.
The limitation of the cable TV networks, however, is that they were designed
for one-way, point-to-multi-point communications, whereas true interactive
television will require switching systems, more like the telephone network.
Thus the cable TV industry also faces huge costs.
Another drawback of the cable television networks is that they generally
cover only a small area - one town or city - and are not interconnected. How
this problem will be resolved remains unclear.
Even as the communications 'pipe layers' continue their preparation for the
advent of interactive multimedia communications services, the personal
computer and television industries are involved in a parallel battle.
Intel, the leading manufacturer of microprocessor chips used in personal
computers, maintains that personal computers will be the primary 'conduit'
on to the information superhighway. 'PC technology is advancing far more
rapidly than television technology,' says Avram Miller of Intel. ' Already,
30 per cent of US homes have personal computers. How long will it take for
interactive television to reach that level?'
While most discussions of the information highway focus on the notion of 500
channels of interactive cable TV being piped into living rooms, Intel
believes that business use of video conference and multimedia information
services, delivered via the PC screen, will take off first, with
applications for the home trailing by at least two years.
While competition between industry sectors expands, it is already intense
within established industry segments. As many as a dozen companies, for
example, are vying for position in the market for TV set top terminals -
electronic boxes that will sit on top of the television decoding and
transmitting two-way signals.
Computer companies are already elbowing each other in the emerging market
for 'video servers'; electronic juke boxes that will store and retrieve
films, television programmes or video clips for 'on demand' services.
Oracle, the leading database software company, has paired with nCube, a
manufacturer of massively parallel supercomputers, in a bid to lead the
video server market. But International Business Machines and Hewlett-Packard
also have their eyes on this prize market. Sales of video servers are
expected to surge to Dollars 5.1bn by 1997, from just Dollars 16m last year,
according to Dataquest.
Meanwhile, Microsoft has developed video server software that will run on
networked personal computers that sell for a fraction of the cost of a
mainframe computer or supercomputer. The intense competition surrounding the
implementation of 'information superhighways' is probably the surest sign
that this technology vision will soon become reality. Rather than a
'convergence' of industries, however, it seems likely to involve the
invasion of established industry sectors by ambitious newcomers. For all
industry participants, keeping pace with rapid change will be essential to
success.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of Credit Management (10): Companies recognise the
connection - Christine Tighe profiles Nicholas Wilson, the first professor
of credit management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Professor Nicholas Wilson, the first holder of the Institute of Credit
Management's (ICM) newly created chair at Bradford university, has clear
objectives.
He seeks to raise the profile of credit management as an academic discipline
and as a vital function within companies. His task is to launch an extensive
programme of research in credit management, developing its profile in the
academic curriculum and professional training and attracting talented young
people to work in the area.
To some extent, his appointment last summer was in itself a significant step
forward; he believes he is the first professor of credit management not just
in the UK but in the world.
The subject draws from various disciplines, including economics, finance and
information technology (IT). 'My function is to bring them together into a
credit management discipline,' he says. 'It is an exciting area, fairly new,
with a lot of developments. It is coming to be seen as a critical function,
whether you are talking about a small business or a multinational body.'
His own background includes an undergraduate degree in industrial economics,
followed by a PhD thesis on participation and profit sharing in British
engineering; research fellowships in West Berlin's Wissenschaftzentrum and
at Warwick University; and a nine year stint as a lecturer at Bradford
Management Centre in managerial economics. He is now 37.
It may seem a long way from small companies' unglamorous but persistent
worries about recalcitrant late payers to Nicholas Wilson's high flying
academic career and his ambitious use of powerful computer neural networks
to produce predictive modelling tools for credit risk. But companies'
initial response to his work suggests that they see the connection.
There has been an excellent response to a research project he recently set
up, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), to collect
new empirical evidence on small companies' working capital management policy
and practices. Of the 100-strong pilot group approached, 35 per cent
responded with full information. Astonishingly - or perhaps not, if you are
familiar with the preoccupations of small businesses - some respondents said
they spend 85 per cent of their time managing cash flow and chasing debts.
'If you look at figures on failure, it's largely because of cash flow
problems in the small business sector,' says Prof Wilson. 'A number of
things could help - more prompt payments by larger businesses, better
understanding by the banking sector of the difficulties small businesses
face, and more training in cash flow management.'
Further research launched since his appointment has also found companies
willing to co-operate. But he believes there is still a long way to go to
achieve his broad aim of raising credit management's status.
'There's an image that the credit manager is somebody who chases debts and
that's it - an internal process in the organisation,' he says. 'But that's
far from the truth. Credit managers are business analysts; they're closer to
the business than anybody else.'
Credit management, he says, should now be part of the structure of an
organisation, and should begin before an account is opened. 'That is why
credit risk modelling has to be more sophisticated, to try to profile risks
and understand them.' This does not necessarily mean that credit will
ultimately be withheld; rather that it is given on a better informed basis.
In some companies the credit management arm is jokily known as the sales
prevention team - and yet this should be far from the case. 'It facilitates
business rather than preventing it.'
In order to produce the more sophisticated predictive tools he has in mind,
Prof Wilson is leading research on the modelling of corporate distress and
failure, both by devising statistical models and by using neural network
computer systems which can predict outcomes, such as credit risk categories,
on the basis of recognising patterns in the information fed in. PhD students
with backgrounds in mathematics, finance and accountancy are co-operating on
this neural network research, funded by the ESRC.
He has also instigated research into trade credit, both as a form of short
term financing and a source of competitive advantage - an area of academic
study he considers relatively neglected.
The research will examine why and when non-financial sector companies use
trade credit, how they establish terms and how they manage these activities.
Initial data is available from companies' own accounting information and
from Companies House, but Prof Wilson plans to begin building up from next
month a sample of 1,000 companies willing to co-operate in an annual
monitoring exercise which will be sustained over a number of years.
Other research projects include study of the survival and performance of new
start-ups in West Yorkshire, and the Working Capital Management study (which
unearthed the would-be entrepreneurs who spend 85 per cent of their time on
cash flow management).
Research, however, is only one part of Nicholas Wilson's brief. After
Easter, the current year's MBA intake at Bradford Management Centre will be
able to opt for a module in credit risk management. Out of about 100
students on this year's MBA, at least 15 have so far signed up for the
subject.
And from next academic year, undergraduates will be able to include a module
in credit management in their courses. Because Bradford's degrees are
modular in structure, students from a wide range of disciplines will be able
to take this option.
Prof Wilson will also be laying on, at the Bradford Management Centre, short
executive courses on techniques and new developments in credit management.
The first of these seminars, aimed at those already working in the field,
will be held for two days in November. Bradford, he says, was an appropriate
choice for the ICM chair because the management centre has an excellent
reputation both for the quality of its research and for its practical
orientation.
The centre's clients include Unilever, Allied Lyons, Rolls-Royce, Ford and
the BBC - and Bradford was the first university to establish a chair in
Total Quality Management.
The Institute of Credit Management chair has been created initially for five
years, at an annual cost of Pounds 50,000. A number of sponsors, including
3M, Cork Gully, Dun &amp; Bradstreet, and Infolink, are each contributing Pounds
5,000 for the first five years. The ICM hopes that, thereafter, the post
will have become so well established that Bradford University will absorb it
within its own structure.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of Credit Management (9): Powerhouse capability to
deliver - Information Technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER CARTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The use of information technology has now permeated almost every stage of
the credit management cycle, from application vetting through to litigation.
At the start of the cycle a large number of companies provide on-line
assessments of credit worthiness in the trade finance and consumer sectors.
Clients are demanding information in more user friendly forms.
For example, UAPT-Infolink has just launched Prophet, a Windows-based
package. Data is downloaded on to a client pc from Infolink's mainframes and
can then be fully manipulated using the full range of Windows' facilities,
including graphical interfaces. 'We're giving them full remote processing
capability,' says Mr Kevin Still, Infolink's head of marketing.
From the mid-1980s the UK's credit information providers started to tie
their computer systems into those of important clients. News about a
particular customer can be fed straight into a client's database on demand.
'For our very large customers we can build direct links into our database
and give them unlimited access,' says Mr Chris Brooker, distribution and
marketing director at Dun &amp; Bradstreet.
Alternatively, rather than providing information on request, credit
information on customer files in client databases can be continuously
updated. 'It's really a question of giving them a seamless system,' says Mr
David Pearce, director of computer service development at Graydon Ltd, a
trade finance information provider.
Scoring systems are one of the most high-profile uses of IT within the
credit management function. They are mainly used to vet consumer credit
applications - though use in trade finance is growing - with points awarded
for key factors such as how long applicants have been in residence at their
current addresses, whether spouses are in employment and so on. Fair Isaac
developed the technique in the US back in 1958. Other suppliers of score
cards are CCN, MDS and Mathtec, with bureau services available from Equifix,
Scorex and UAPT-Infolink.
Building credit score cards is no longer the preserve of external experts.
Paragon Business Solutions has been marketing DSS, a pc-based package for
in-house score card building, for over two years.
Ms Caroline Hendra, head of personal credit at the Co-op bank, has used DSS
to build an application scorecard for a Visa gold card and to predict
response for a personal loan product. She also uses external consultants,
but is clear on the need for in-house building: 'As life becomes more
complicated you need to react more quickly.' Scorex can also supply building
software and SAS Institute Ltd will assist with development tools.
About 10 years after developing credit score carding, Fair Isaac began to
aggregate data drawn off customers' files after credit had been granted. The
resulting behaviour score cards enable companies to decide, for example,
whether to increase a client's credit limit or to renew a facility.
It is only in recent years that behaviour scoring has really taken off, on
the back of computers' advances in power and agility. 'It has big IT
applications,' says Mr O D Nelson, senior vice president at Fair Isaac.
'There can be 150 characteristics on a rich customer file to bring into a
decision making algorithm.' About two thirds of bank credit cards now have
account details analysed by behaviour scoring.
Mr Ian Arthur, an associate partner with Andersen Consulting, points to the
way in which sophisticated relational databases are increasingly built into
operational systems, linking and exploiting information across customer
files for different credit products. 'You can be more focused in the
marketing you do,' he says. Behaviour scores are combined with other data to
assess a customer's likelihood of buying a new product.
Use of expert systems is growing. A scorecard predicts customers' future
actions on the basis of past behaviour. Expert systems are built by
extracting the rules underlying credit professionals' decisions and building
systems that apply them automatically. Use has expanded beyond application
vetting to decide, for example, whether to authorise unusually large
transactions.
Neural networks are the next stage. Rules built into expert systems can only
be changed externally, but neural networks alter them on the basis of
experience. According to Mr Darren Whobery, new technology consultant at
UAPT-Infolink, neural networks have a slight edge in many applications. The
gap widens if there is more data available, particularly if it contains
variables with non-linear relationships.
Neural networks are already in use in the US. They are often coupled with
more conventional technology in hybrid systems, and are creeping into the
UK. 'It's only a question of time,' says Mr Arthur. UAPT-Infolink is being
sponsored by a club of big UK financial institutions, to evaluate neural
networks against score cards and expert systems.
The final stage of the credit process is, of course, collection. Systems
have been available for this end of the cycle for over 10 years and have
been particularly useful in the recession and its aftermath. Cases can be
put on a priority list for pursuit, according to rules laid down by users.
As part of pre-litigation processes, packages can now help users decide
whether to pursue a debt in-house, use an external collection agent or go to
the courts. They can issue letters of reminder and warnings before
initiating County Court and High Court proceedings.
Sanderson CFL markets two packages in this area. Tallyman deals with arrears
and collections, while the wonderfully named Minder (Monitored Integrated
Debt Recovery) assists recovery and litigation. 'We've done very well out of
it,' says Sanderson's Ms Sharon McBean, of the latter.
The packages are suitable for clients handling at least 10,000 debtors.
Current users include banks, building societies and utilities. Other
suppliers of software in this area include Target Computer Group, AST
TransAct (part of SHL Systemhouse Europe Group), AIM Law Data and Law Data
Systems.
Credit Collection Systems Ltd offers a bureau-type service to companies
wanting an in-house collection system without a large capital outlay. 'We
take care of all the hardware and software,' says sales manager Mr Richard
Brooks. Users access a central processing installation through terminals,
and payment is on the basis of each account put on the system.
Computers can deal with administration of undefended cases, but with
defended actions the role of IT in the credit management cycle ends. As Mr
Brooks points out, computers cannot yet walk into court and argue a case:
'There's no way you can take it that far.'

FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of US Communications (9): PC competitors on their
marks - The start of a tough technology contest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Apple Computer's introduction this month of the first PowerPC Macintosh
personal computers will blow the starting whistle on what promises to be one
of the toughest technology competitions in the history of the personal
computer industry.
On the PowerPC team, together with Apple, will be Motorola and International
Business Machines. Together the three companies have co-developed a
microprocessor architecture which they aim to establish as a new industry
standard for PCs.
They face the reigning champions of the PC microprocessor market, Intel and
its league of PC-manufacturing technology partners, led by IBM.
One of the most curious aspects of this contest is that IBM is playing on
both sides. Long a close ally of Intel, IBM is the largest manufacturer of
Intel microprocessor-based PCs and says it intends to remain so. However,
the computer company is also a co-developer and manufacturer of PowerPC and
has stated that the new technology is central to its future strategy.
This ambiguity aside, the contest is a straightforward shoot out between
PowerPC and Intel's Pentium, the latest version of its long-established
'x86' microprocessor lineage.
PowerPC has a Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architecture.
Theoretically this suggests that it may be faster than Intel's Pentium.
However, PowerPC lacks the critical software base of Intel's microprocessors
and its performance in commercial systems is relatively unproven.
In contrast, Intel's Pentium has a huge head start in the marketplace as the
successor of the widely used Intel 386 and 486 microprocessors, the 'brains'
of most PCs in use today.
The Intel chips run Microsoft's popular MS-DOS and Windows operating system
software and the thousands of application programs designed to work with
them.
Apple's debut of PowerPC-based Macintosh computers will be a critical test
of the new technology. Apple is expected to launch three 'PowerMac'
computers ranging in price from about Dollars 2,400 to about Dollars 4,000
to replace its 'Quadra' models aimed at business users. Apple says that it
intends to convert 40 per cent of its Macintosh shipments to PowerPC by
year's end, with the complete changeover occurring within three to four
years.
For Apple, the PowerPC represents an important transition from Motorola's
68000 line of microprocessors, which it has used since the introduction of
the Macintosh computer 12 years ago.
Apple needed a new microprocessor to keep pace with competitors using
Intel's chips, but its decision to join with IBM and Motorola in developing
a brand new architecture makes the transition more risky.
PowerPC's may have a speed advantage over Pentium. However, among existing
Apple customers the PowerMac may be judged as much for its compatibility
with existing Macintosh software as for its raw performance.
This could give the PowerPC a rough start in the personal computer market.
According to industry reports, about 90 per cent of existing Macintosh
software will run on the new Apple computers, but only via emulation
software which will significantly slow down performance.
Thus, although PowerPC may be theoretically capable of outpacing the Intel
Pentium, that may not be the practical experience of the first users of
personal computers based on the new microprocessor.
Apple says that about 75 application programs designed specifically for the
PowerMac will be available when the computers are introduced, and that
hundreds more are in development.
However, software companies are unlikely to make development of applications
programs for the PowerMac a high priority. Apple says that it expects to
sell up to 1m PowerMac computers in the first 12 months. While this would be
a significant achievement for Apple, it presents a relatively limited market
for software designed solely for the PowerMac.
In contrast, Intel expects about 15 per cent of all PCs sold this year, or
approximately 7m units, to be based on its Pentium chips. Most of the
remaining 40m PCs will contain Intel 486 microprocessors. Thus Intel-based
PCs represent a far larger potential market for software applications than
the PowerMac.
Therefore even if the PowerMac exceeds Apple's expectations, it will hardly
make a dent in Intel's dominance of the personal computer microprocessor
market. Intel and its backers, meanwhile, are targeting Apple's existing
market share, aiming to take advantage of the uncertainties created by the
transition to PowerPC.
However, Apple is not alone in its plans to offer PowerPC-based personal
computers. IBM already offers a computer work station based on the PowerPC
microprocessor. The company is expected to introduce a broad range of
'Power' machines for more general use, including portable PCs. However, it
is not yet clear how IBM will position these products relative to its strong
Intel-based PC product line.
IBM is also actively seeking PowerPC endorsements from other computer
makers. The first, Canon of Japan, said recently that it will use PowerPC in
a new range of office computers and work with IBM and Motorola to develop
versions of PowerPC for use in hand-held and notebook-sized computers.
In Taiwan, PowerPC has attracted great interest among PC circuit-board
manufacturers. However, these sub-system manufacturers are unlikely to take
a leadership role in developing the PowerPC market. Instead, they tend to
wait for demand to develop in the US market.
IBM says it has sold more than 800 PowerPC 'reference specifications' to PC
manufacturers and software developers interested in developing products
around the new technology. Computers that adhere to these specifications
will eventually be able to run a smorgasbord of operating systems and
applications software, IBM says. Microsoft has announced plans to port
Windows NT to the PowerPC, and IBM's new Workplace OS will run DOS, Windows,
and OS/2 applications on the PowerPC. PowerOpen, another 'multipersonality'
operating environment, is being developed specifically for PowerPC systems
by Apple and IBM.
Together IBM and Apple aim to establish a 30 per cent share of the PC market
for PowerPC by the end of the decade, leaving Intel with perhaps 60 per cent
(the rest being clones of Intel microprocessors), down from about 80 per
cent today.
Thus while PowerPC may somewhat diminish Intel's market share, not even its
most optimistic backers expect to overtake Intel's leadership in the
microprocessor market in the short term. In the longer term, the outcome of
the PowerPC v Intel battle is likely to depend as much on software
developers as on the relative merits of each type of microprocessor.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of US Communications (8): Competition for connections
gets fiercer - Andrew Adonis discusses the intense rivalry between the
long-distance carriers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The break-up of the old AT&amp;T company in 1984 was largely intended to
stimulate competition in the US long-distance telecommunications market.
That now appears a conservative goal. In the US - as in the UK, which
licensed its first long-distance competitor to its former monopoly in the
same year as divestiture - the policy emphasis is now on creating the
conditions for competition in the local network, which was almost
universally regarded as a natural monopoly in the mid-1980s. At that time,
however, even the idea of a battle in the long-distance market was near
revolutionary, with loud cries of 'waste' and 'needless duplication'.
Few raise them today. Spending by the long-distance carriers on advertising
is colossal: AT&amp;T alone spends about 10 times as much as BT on advertising,
as a proportion of turnover. There is also public scepticism about the
savings to be gained from switching operators for short-term savings; so
much so that the theme of much AT&amp;T advertising is the futility of switching
from one carrier to another carrier to save a pittance.
But the effect of competition in increasing the range and quality of
services is undeniable. So is its impact on prices, however little they may
vary between operators at any one time. The beneficiaries have not just been
customers using the public networks, but also businesses using leased lines.
According to a report by the UK trade and industry department last month,
the price of long-distance leased lines is barely a fraction of that charged
by European operators.
Three companies operate national long-distance networks - AT&amp;T, MCI and
Sprint. There is also a host of re-sellers. At one stage New York boasted
around 100 long-distance operators, including re-sellers. The ranks of
re-sellers have thinned as margins in the long-distance business have
fallen, but they can be expected to spring to life again as high-margin
international traffic is fully opened to the re-sale market.
AT&amp;T, MCI and Sprint divide the market roughly 70:20:10 between them. Since
a rapid loss of market share in the late-1980s, AT&amp;T has been holding its
own. 'The market structure is remarkably similar to other businesses with a
former dominant supplier,' says Mr Alex Mandl, chief executive of AT&amp;T's
communications systems division. 'As soon as you have competition of any
seriousness, a fifth of the market will go in its direction'.
MCI and Sprint are highly serious competitors. Says Mr Gerald Taylor, MCI
vice-president responsible for marketing: 'The industry has moved from a
commodity business to a branded products and services business. Ten years
ago we had just three products, now we have 300 - it's just like packaging
and selling soap powder, only our ingredients happen to be technology.'
The key is to get to the market first. MCI's triumph in the late-1980s was
its 'Friends and Family' calling plan, giving residential customers reduced
rates for frequently-dialled numbers. It was similarly adroit with its '1800
Collect' service. 'We got there 12 weeks before AT&amp;T, and that 12 weeks was
utterly critical,' says Mr Taylor.
Mr Mandl does not dissent, claiming that 'competition is at least as
important as technology in getting services to consumers'. The opportunity
to re-sell capacity is not enough. 'There have to be rival networks if the
operators are going to be able to craft their own services and break the
monopoly mentality'.
Aside from the battle for existing long-distance business, two trends are
evident. First, like the soap powder manufacturers, the long-distance
carriers believe their products and branding are for export. AT&amp;T is the
most ambitious, with its 'world partners' venture aiming to provide global
services to multinationals through an upgraded 'backbone' network and
special relationships with carriers worldwide.
Although its rhetoric is of competition with existing monopolists in Europe
and elsewhere, probe gently and there is a readiness to work with almost
anyone prepared to market AT&amp;T services. 'In some countries we will partner
with existing state monopolies,' Mr Mandl concedes. 'On balance we would
prefer to work with them if we can provide an attractive offering.'
MCI hopes to accomplish the same object in partnership with British
Telecommunications, the UK operator with whom it signed a Dollars 5.3bn
alliance last year. Under the arrangement, MCI is to take the lead in
America, and BT beyond. But BT is learning marketing at MCI's feet: it has
recently introduced a version of 'Friends and Family' in the UK, and that is
expected to be only the first of the exports.
The second trend is the entry of the long-distance carriers into the US
local market. Arguably AT&amp;T is already there, through its purchase last year
of McCaw Cellular Communications, among the largest US cellular operators.
Both AT&amp;T and MCI have declared their intention to take part in the bidding
for PCS licences due to be auctioned later this year. 'The objective is a
national seamless service, as a replacement for the 'plain old telephone
service' of today,' says Mr Laurence Harris, head of MCI's wireless
communications group. 'There are plenty of partners coming to us seeking the
MCI brand name, and we are as far ahead as anyone in the industry in terms
of capacity.'
If regulatory reform allows them into the fixed-wire local market, the
long-distance carriers can be expected to exploit opportunities rapidly.
They are particularly interested in the business customers so successfully
exploited by competitive access providers (Caps) in recent years. 'We need a
direct relationship with the end user,' says Mr Mandl.
He talks equally enthusiastically of AT&amp;T's future involvement in
multi-media. 'We are not in the 'content' business,' he is careful to
stipulate, 'but we will have the 'broadband' networks, plus storage and
distribution facilities, essential to anyone who wants to reach the mass
market.'
However, in all fields, beating the opposition is only one task. Growing the
market is at least as important. 'Since 1984 our revenues have risen every
year, because we are after growth above all,' says Mr Mandl. As Mr Taylor of
MCI notes, in the past decade average prices have fallen by 50 per cent but
the average telecoms bill has risen from Dollars 22 to Dollars 26.50 in real
terms. 'Above all, competition has been about changing peoples' attitude to
the telephone and the cost of using it. Every advert ramming home the point
that it's cheap to call helps to do it, whoever is paying for the ad.'

FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of US Communications (10): Better ride for the
'little guy' - Reasons for the collapse of the Bell Atlantic-TCI merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The unexpected collapse of the planned merger of Bell Atlantic and
Tele-Communications, two of the largest and most aggressive companies in the
US telephone and cable TV industries, has poured cold water on the frenzy of
industry excitement surrounding the development of 'information
superhighways'.
The merger, announced last October and initially valued at between Dollars
20bn and Dollars 30bn, had been touted as forming the 'model communications
company for the information age'. Bell Atlantic, one of the most innovative
of the US regional telephone companies, planned to acquire TCI, the largest
US cable television company serving about 20 per cent of US homes.
Bell Atlantic had planned to establish interactive cable television services
within its region of operations, while adding telephony services to TCI's
cable operations in other parts of the country. The result would eventually
have been a massive interactive multi-media communications network spanning
more than 40 states.
By calling off their merger, Bell Atlantic and TCI have at least postponed
the emergence of the first multi-media communications company with national
reach. What is not yet clear, however, is how much influence the 'regulatory
and market uncertainties' which Bell Atlantic and TCI say forced them to
abandon their plans, will have on deployment of the much-touted 'information
superhighways'.
On the regulatory side, both Bell Atlantic and TCI blamed the Federal
Communications Commission's recent decision to mandate a 7 per cent
reduction in cable television service prices for the collapse of their deal.
TCI strongly criticised the FCC's action as 'unwarranted, excessively
severe, and harmful both to the national telecommunications objectives
promoted by the Clinton administration and, ultimately, to the interests of
consumers'.
The price rollback will reduce TCI's cash flow by about Dollars 144m
annually, said John Malone, TCI president. This significantly reduced the
valuation put on the cable TV company in the merger talks, which had been
calculated as a multiple of cash flow, he explained.
'The FCC does not seem to appreciate the impact that its action will have on
the ability of the cable industry to raise capital,' Mr Malone charged. The
industry will be hampered in its ability to upgrading networks to carry
interactive multimedia signals, he said. 'I hope that the FCC will come back
with some very strong inducements for upgrades and expansions.'
Analysts noted, however, that the FCC's action will effectively reduce the
price that cable companies command, encouraging acquisitions of the numerous
smaller companies in the cable TV business. For the many towns and cities
throughout the US served by these smaller cable companies, this could hasten
rather than retard the arrival of interactive multimedia services.
Moreover, the FCC cannot be given all the blame for the wreckage of the
Bell-TCI plans. It appears that the companies faced a series of difficulties
in consumating their merger. While TCI's value may have been diminished by
the FCC action, Bell Atlantic's share price had already been driven down
over the past four months, by Wall Street's nervous reaction to the deal.
This significantly reduced the value of the shares that Bell was offering
for TCI, putting the deal in jeopardy.
Wall Street's concerns about the huge investments required to create
information superhighways and the potential returns on those investments,
together with uncertainties about the regulatory environment, have also
driven down the share prices of other US telephone companies. US West, for
example, has seen its share price decline by almost 20 per cent since
mid-October, while BellSouth, another big investor in 'information
superhighways' has fallen 10 per cent.
Nonetheless, the lure of huge new markets for network traffic and services
together with the unrelenting pace of technology development are driving
rapid changes in the US communications industry. Other US telephone and
cable television companies have vowed to push ahead with their plans to
build interactive multi-media networks.
US West, which last year acquired a 23 per cent stake in Time Warner's cable
business for Dollars 2.5bn, said that it still plans to invest Dollars 1bn
to convert Time Warner cable systems into advanced communications networks.
The companies are about to begin a field trial offering about 4,000 homes in
Orlando, Florida, video-on-demand services.
Cox Cable, which has teamed up with Southwestern Bell in a Dollars 4.9bn
venture to build advanced networks, will also continue to push forward, the
company said.
'The decision of regulators or corporations may change the participants, but
not the deployment of superhighway technology or the timing very much,' said
a spokesman for BellSouth, which is involved in a joint venture with Prime
Cable Management to upgrade cable systems in Las Vegas. The telephone
company, 'remains committed to becoming a key participant'.
Ameritech is spending Dollars 4.4bn to convert its telephone network to
carry video services over the next 15 years. 'We intend to stay the course
we have set,' said Richard Notebaert, Ameritech president. 'Customers, not
the industry or other forces, will set the pace for development of
interactive programming.'
Even Bell Atlantic is determined to press on, in spite of the merger
collapse. The company will seek mergers or alliances with other companies.
'This would have been the alliance on a grand scale,' said James Cullen,
Bell Atlantic president. 'We're going to have to look for opportunities on a
smaller scale.'
Bell Atlantic still expects to have a broadband, fibre-optic network in
place to reach more than 1m homes by the end of 1995, and 8.75m homes by
2000. Initially, the network is expected to carry basic cable services and
video-on-demand. Later, other services such as home shopping, home banking,
remote education and video games may be added.
Some even see the collapse of the Bell Atlantic-TCI deal as a positive
development because it might have deterred competition in the emerging
market for advanced multi-media communications.
'The end of this merger is not the end of the information superhighway, but
the beginning of a superhighway we can all afford to ride,' said Senator
Howard Metzenbaum, who had opposed the merger. 'Without these giants hogging
the road, the little guy is less likely to get squeezed.'

FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of Credit Management (6): Cover can be expensive or
not available - The UK's approach to export credit insurance seems pretty
incoherent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the exporter, winning an order is often just a first step towards making
the sale. In addition it is often necessary to arrange financing and, in an
uncertain world, export credit insurance.
Export credit insurance provides the means for companies to reduce and
manage the risk inherent in exporting - a vital service in a nation such as
Britain. As Mr Keith Johnson, export finance manager at Siemens Plessey
Systems and chairman of the British Exporters Association, points out, 'We
are still one of the biggest exporters per capita in the world.'
Nevertheless, many of the UK's regular exporters - they number about 40,000,
complain that while there have been some improvements, insurance cover is
still too expensive or unavailable for some markets.
More pointedly, Mr Johnson claims that British exporters often lose out
against their continental counterparts because the UK lacks a coherent
government-backed export policy.
As a result, he says, British support for exports is haphazard. It often
compares unfavourably with that available to the competition, where the
export financing as well as the credit insurance is often provided by state-
controlled entities.
'We need a full political commitment to support and sustain exports, and
that is the fundamental problem,' says Mr Campbell Dunford, chairman of the
London Chamber of Commerce's export committee
This deficiency is particularly critical in the market for medium and long
term credit insurance which, throughout the European Union, is provided by
government agencies.
In the UK, the Export Credit Guarantee Department (ECGD) provided insurance
to cover about Pounds 4bn of 'long and large' exports last year - usually
for big sales such as shipping or aerospace contracts, or large projects
when payment is expected over a two-year period or longer.
ECGD premium rates have been reduced several times over the past two years,
while cover has been increased. In December the UK chancellor announced a
reduction in ECGD premium rates in a limited number of markets, including
Argentina, India, Mexico, Poland, Slovakia and Turkey, and a Pounds 200m
increase in export credit insurance cover for capital exports in 1996-97.
But while Mr Dunford says these moves were a step in the right direction and
reflect 'a gathering awareness' of the importance of exports, he also points
out that premium rates for many markets are still uncompetitive. 'We are not
asking for anything special,' adds Mr Johnson, 'just a sense of realism.'
Meanwhile UK exporters have discovered common ground with their continental
counterparts when it comes to EU proposals for the harmonisation of export
credit insurance regimes contained in the so-called Tuffrau report.
In January a delegation led by Mr Johnson, representing exporters from
Germany, Holland, Spain, France and the UK, met Commission officials to
express their concern over harmonisation plans. These, Mr Johnson said,
reflected, 'introspective activity by EU officials,' largely for the
convenience of treasuries across Europe which are trying to reduce their
support for exporters.
Following the meeting, EU exporters are optimistic about their chances of
forcing amendments to the harmonisation plans - although Commission
officials have warned that it will be difficult to change the minds of
national governments at this late stage.
One of the main issues is over the level of cover available from member
country export credit agencies. Under the EU proposals, the level of cover
provided by the agencies to banks for buyer and supplier credits would be
harmonised at 85 per cent of the contract value. However. the EU exporters
argue that this would place them at a serious disadvantage against the US
and other competing OECD countries which provide 100 per cent cover.
Instead, the exporters argue that the EU should harmonise upwards to 100 per
cent, thereby matching international competition. 'Harmonisation must occur
at the highest common denominator to ensure that Europe is competitive
against the Americans, Japanese, Canadians and, in the future, countries
such as Taiwan, South Korea, China and Malaysia,' says Mr Johnson.
The British Exporters Association has prepared a matrix listing exporters'
concerns over harmonisation issues, including divergence of premium rates,
quality of cover and unequal treatment of risk analysis by credit agencies.
British exporters are also worried about the cost and provision of short
term cover - which represents about 85 per cent of all export credit
insurance. In the UK the ECGD's short term insurance services were
privatised in December 1991, as a result of which two main competing private
sector insurance providers have emerged.
The UK market is now mainly divided between the Dutch-owned NCM Credit
Insurance, which bought the ECGD's Cardiff-based short-term business and has
about 80 per cent of the UK export credit insurance market providing about
Pounds 15bn of cover annually, and Trade Indemnity (TI), a relative newcomer
to the export market.
TI is the largest UK domestic credit insurance supplier, but it has also
moved into the export market where it provides about Pounds 4bn of cover a
year. There is 'healthy competition' between the two organisations, says Mr
James Ball of Dewe Rogerson Europe, who represents NCM.
Generally, the insurers cover exporters against losses up to 90 per cent of
the value of invoices where a customer defaults, and up to 95 per cent if
the customer is willing to pay but the country defaults (as Nigeria did in
1983).
Exporters agree that the quality of service since privatisation has improved
considerably. Nevertheless, privatisation has meant that the UK, alone in
the EU, does not supply state reinsurance support for short term export
credit. The government has extended 'transitional' cover until the end of
1997, but the lack of permanence has caused uncertainty.
Exporters also argue that the transitional reinsurance arrangements are not
flexible enough - which means that, in some notable instances, cover has
been unavailable for export orders won in the wake of ministerial
export-boosting trips overseas. 'There needs to be a much faster mechanism
for responding to the needs of the marketplace,' says Mr Dunford.
'The Treasury expects a 4 per cent increase in exports year on year, but has
made no provision for achieving this,' complains the outspoken Mr Johnson.
'They think it will come from the tooth fairy.'
Indeed, although NCM and TI do provide substantial short term export credit
insurance, many exporters believe that UK exports to emerging markets such
as China would be substantially higher if the supply and cost of credit
insurance became easier, and if a more co-ordinated approach was adopted by
Government.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of Credit Management (8): Demand has recently risen
sharply - Recruitment into the profession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Communication skills are probably the greatest asset a credit manager can
have,' says Mrs Ann Stutz, recruitment service manager at the Institute of
Credit Management.
The ICM is the professional body concerned with the credit management
function, with membership of the institute recognised by employers as proof
of professional knowledge and competence in credit work.
The institute's recruitment bureau, which has been running for 25 years, is
one of the institute's commercial arms and offers a complete recruitment
package covering all levels of personnel, from credit clerk to board
appointments.
The service offers standard or executive search facilities. In the first
instance fees are only charged on successful placement. In the second, a fee
structure is devised to meet the specific needs of the assignment.
'Employers use the service because of our specialised knowledge of the
credit function,' says Mrs Stutz. 'In addition we are often required to act
as a reference point to both employers and employees on salary and benefit
related queries.'
Mrs Stutz declines to disclose the numbers of people on the bureau's
recruitment books, or annual placement rates, but says that demand for
credit managers fell during the recession but has risen sharply in recent
months, with a 50 per cent increase on the lowest point.
Most of her clients are the bigger companies, but she says many smaller
companies are now hiring in-house credit managers because of the need for
improved cash-flow.
Traditionally, smaller companies have used debt collection agencies, which
may ask for a percentage of the recovered debts. However, if a small
company's business is complex and specialist, or has substantial sales
abroad, an in-house credit controller is probably the preferred option.
Mrs Stutz says: 'It is clear that more enlightened employers have come to
realise that efficient credit management can hold the key to greater
liquidity. In fact, for the smaller company, it can often make the
difference between weathering the recession or financial failure.'
So what constitutes the ideal credit controller? Mrs Stutz says that there
are three main types of people who are needed in what can be a very
demanding job.
Analytical people who can gather data on customers, make recommendations or
take decisions and explain them to others.
Outgoing people who can establish friendly relationships with customers and
sales staff to improve the flow of payments.
Methodical people who can process payments and handle information rapidly
and accurately.
It is useful, she says, for a trained credit manager to have specialist
knowledge of financial and strategic planning, legal procedures and
insolvency law.
So where do credit controllers work? 'Almost anywhere,'says Mrs Stutz. She
adds that every form of trading company needs a credit department, making
sure that the companies it sold to, pay within the agreed time limit. This
was 'trade' or commercial credit. If credit was granted overseas, it was
described as 'export' credit. Companies enabling individuals to purchase
goods by installments were in the world of consumer credit.
Moreover, there were companies whose main business was credit - they
included finance and hire purchase companies, credit card companies, banks,
credit insurance companies and credit reference bureaux. Then there were
jobs in companies such as collection agencies, which recovered overdue
accounts, and with accountants specialising in insolvency matters.
Mrs Stutz says that the days are gone when the credit function is solely
about getting paid. The modern credit controller is involved in assessing
the risk of doing business with a customer. It is no longer acceptable for
sales or marketing personnel, keen for orders and commissions, to pay lip
service to a customer's credit worthiness and ability to pay on time.
She says that, in the past, too many companies set inappropriate credit
terms, or allowed customers to take unofficial extended credit.
Too often, a company would use the credit function as a mopping up exercise
when things went wrong. The necessity for legal action was often the result
of failure on the part of the company to support efficient credit procedure
and allocate adequate human resources. 'Wiser companies,' she says, have
learnt that it should only be used as a useful adjunct to credit management
skills, not instead of them.
Mr Ted Brown, vice chairman of the IPM, is head of credit control at
Britvic, the soft drinks division of Bass, the brewing and hotel group.
His department works in tandem with the company's sales team, checking out
all new customers and keeping in regular contact with existing ones. 'We
want to supply our products to any customer who wants them, but we have to
check on their ability to pay and their willingness to pay within agreed
terms,' says Mr Brown. Every account is given a credit vetting and a credit
line, which can be adjusted depending on circumstances.
The task is large and complex. Britvic has more than 10,000 accounts owing
between Pounds 40m and Pounds 60m at any one time, depending on the time of
the year. Customers range from tiny corner shops to the big supermarket
chains.
The department employs 70 people. Proof of its increased efficiency shows in
the fact that during the past four years it has reduced the average time
customers take to pay from 60 days to 40 days. In this it has been assisted
by a new computer system that can provide on-line information of customers'
debts.
Sometimes all attempts to collect debts fail and there are customers against
whom legal action has to be taken. 'If we have to do that, I feel we have
failed,' says Mr Brown. 'It means communication has broken down.'

FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of Credit Management (7): Collect it by phone -
Training is a good investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER CARTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Credit managers often complain of limited resources allocated to them for
training. They feel like poor relations as they see sales colleagues sent
off on course after course. However, there are signs that the situation is
improving.
'People are starting to realise that it is worth investing in training,'
says Ms Jill Weymouth, a Bristol-based freelance trainer. But progress is
not fast enough for some. 'It's changing very, very slowly,' says Mr Denis
Trought, director of Credit Management Training Ltd, looking back over 16
years in the industry.
At least the recession and its aftermath have increased momentum. Mr Trought
has seen steady demand for his courses over the past few years. 'There
wasn't any slackening off,' he says.
At the Institute of Credit Management (ICM), training manager Ms Lesley
Haigh has seen a strong rise in underlying demand over the long term.
In the recession she saw bookings drop, but thinks that this was because of
large numbers of new trainers entering the market. 'There are a lot more
players in the field than there were three or four years ago.' Newcomers
include sizeable organisations such as Infocheck, as well as redundant
credit managers who have set up as trainers. Shaws Linton Business Training
Ltd provides over 250 courses right across the business spectrum. The six in
the credit management field are much in demand. 'They are our strongest
performers,' says Ms Amanda Kemp, the marketing manager.
Most trainers report that the most popular courses are in telephone
collection techniques. Ms Weymouth sees this area as fundamental. 'The
telephone is the most practical and effective way of collecting cash,' she
says. 'Telephone collection techniques do tend to point people in the right
direction,' agrees Mr Paul Stevenson, credit manager for BASF.
'95 per cent are not doing it right,' says Mr Trought, of staff that he has
observed before training. Coaching can help employees to prepare properly
before making calls and to be polite but assertive.
Asking the right mixture of 'closed' questions (answerable with a yes or no)
and 'open' questions (which require more explanation) is important. 'You can
probe and question and gain a commitment,' says Ms Weymouth. When dealing
with consumers, debt counselling - as opposed to debt recovery - is
increasingly needed. Training is being refocused accordingly.
Mr Stevenson accepts that some staff have natural gifts in this area, but he
is sure that training does make a difference. His confidence stems from the
fact that, if collection is monitored, the results of a course are easy to
quantify: 'You get a virtually instant indication of how well it's gone by
the effect on cash flow.' The benefits of other kinds of collection courses
are similarly easy to evaluate.
As well as collection techniques, risk assessment courses are in demand.
Interpretation of financial statements is central here. Mainland Europe is a
growing area of interest to companies and bookings for relevant courses are
growing. Dun &amp; Bradstreet has recently launched a new course to help staff
analyse the accounts of European businesses.
There is growing enthusiasm among trainers and companies for in-house
courses. Experts train company staff on-site. 'In-company training has
distinct advantages,' explains BASF's Paul Stevenson. 'It's a method of
operation tailored to a company. If you go to an outside course it might not
be adapted to your needs.' Mr Stevenson says that it becomes viable where
the credit management function has more than half a dozen staff.
Mr David Ancliffe, credit manager at Scottish &amp; Newcastle Sales, which
supplies beverages to supermarkets and other retail outlets, brings in an
external trainer once a year to run a one-day seminar for his 16-member
department. This costs about Pounds 40 per employee. He says that travel and
accommodation costs for external courses would be about Pounds 200 a head,
with course fees on top.
There are other advantages. Trainers can come into the company in pre-course
consultancy to see how employees go about their work, in order to focus
later training sessions properly. 'We can look at systems, talk to staff
confidentially and look at a company's customers,' says Denis Trought of
Credit Management Training. 'We can make the whole thing very personal.'
He says that external courses with participants from a range of industries
can be problematic: 'A couple of people, because of the peculiarities of
their business, will have difficulty relating.'
Simply sending staff on a course is not the end of the story. Credit
managers stress the importance of structured training tailored to employees'
individual requirements. 'Each person has different needs and proceeds at
different speeds,' says Ms Ann Stanislawski, credit manager at Hitachi
Europe. Her five staff all have personal training programmes.
Two of Ms Stanislawski's team are studying for the ICM professional exams
and receive support from the company. She thinks this is important because
their present roles are limited and the ICM syllabus will give them wider
exposure. 'They learn about areas other than trade credit and get a broader
education,' she says.
Ms Jill Weymouth points to the importance of regular training update
courses. In some areas, such as dealing with county courts, rules change
quickly. With practical skills such as collection techniques, booster
courses can pay dividends.
Employees in companies which are particularly budget conscious might find
distance learning a solution. Infocheck launched a correspondence course for
a diploma in credit management last year. 'We were surprised by the
immediate interest,' says Mr Ian Sanderson, director of Infocheck's training
services. More than 150 students have already enrolled. Mr Sanderson thinks
the course material might be particularly useful for staff in small credit
departments who may not have other reference material.
Dun &amp; Bradstreet has run a distance learning programme in credit and
financial analysis for some time. 'Ours has done very well,' says Judith de
Jong, manager of business education services. Successful completion exempts
students from part of the ICM's intermediate syllabus.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of US Communications (7): Eyes on investments abroad
 -Overseas expansion
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Privatisation and liberalisation are advancing across the world. They are
moving fastest in cellular mobile services, which are ready provided on a
competitive basis in most of Europe and much of Asia but they are extending
rapidly to fixed-wire services. The RBOCs are exploiting opportunities in
both fields.
Again, there is no uniform picture. 'Our overseas strategy is a
privatisation strategy,' says Mr Andres Bande, president of Ameritech's
international division. By contrast, Mr Dick Callahan, president of US West
International, who is actually based in London, stresses: 'We emphatically
do not have a privatisation strategy. Ours is based above all on wireless
and cable local networks.' Nynex's Mr Rubin splits the difference: 'We are
looking at all opportunities, and certainly don't want to get typecast as
providers of only one or two types of service.'
The Baby Bells' existing operations underline the diversity. While
Southwestern Bell, Nynex and US West have invested heavily in UK cable TV
and telephone networks, Ameritech and Bell Atlantic have kept clear and been
on the privatisation trail. (They are joint partners in New Zealand and are
active elsewhere). Pacific Telesis has been concentrating on wireless. As
Bell Atlantic's Mr Smith puts it: 'Our strategy abroad is simple - to export
what we do well here.'
BellSouth, the largest of the RBOC's by revenue, is one of the broadest
ranging in its international portfolio. Its activities include a stake in
Optus (the main challenger to the state fixed-wire operator in Australia),
an Dollars 80m mobile data transmission network in France (being built with
France Telecom, the state operator), and a stake in a cellular network in
Germany.
Overseas cellular licences are a field of marked contention between the
RBOCs. At least three RBOCs were looking for partners with whom to bid for
the new GSM digital licence in Italy.
In terms of variety, US West is not far behind BellSouth. It has cellular
operations in Russia and eastern Europe, and is pitching for a basic
line-construction contract in India. In the UK it is operating combined
cable TV/telephone networks and has a 50 per cent stake in Mercury
One-2-One, the UK's new PCN cellular network. It intends to take home the
experience gained on both fronts. Lessons learned with PCN will be
particularly valuable for its ambitions with PCS - the US equivalent of PCN.
'There's room for us all,' says Bell Atlantic's Mr Smith. And not just
abroad. As one RBOC executive noted with a smile, in the US long-distance
business AT&amp;T has been cut down to about 70 per cent market share since
1984, yet its revenues have grown every year.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of US Communications (4): Baby Bells take action
after storm warning - The seven regional Bell operating companies whose
monopolies are under threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US Baby Bell operators are like the man who has just heard a hurricane
warning. It could destroy his house and life, but, on the other hand, it
might go off in a completely different direction. Either way, he is stunned,
dreads the worst, and takes frenzied defensive action.
For the seven local Bell operators, the hurricane warning is the effective
abolition of their local monopolies, which is advancing much faster than
almost anyone believed possible barely a year ago. At one extreme, the
upshot could be the end of the Baby Bell system, as it currently exists,
with two or three vast multi-media companies dominating local telecoms
delivery across the US.
At the other, a modified, somewhat more competitive, version of the status
quo could last for years yet.
Because of this, the Baby Bells are in a hyper-active state, dashing about
in all directions in a bid to secure their valuable goods and chattels from
destruction. Some are sending a large part of their possessions abroad.
Almost all are seeking to lash themselves to cable or entertainment
companies, the better to master the storm. Everyone is hoping to compete in
the telecoms business in new regions of the US.
To gauge the industry's state of mind you need only compare the extreme
reactions. 'The changes coming will dwarf the break up of the Bell system a
decade ago. We're going to have a few large companies, probably in the form
of consortia,' said Mr Richard Notebaert, vice-chairman of Ameritech, which
covers 12m subscribers in the Midwest. Mr Jeff Rubin, chief finance officer
of Nynex, which covers the north-east, is gazing at a different crystal
ball: 'The world will be much less different in ten years time than many
think - it'll be like the airline industry, where everyone has gone down
different highways and byways but still ended up in roughly the same
business.'
The collapse last month of the Dollars 21.4bn merger between Bell Atlantic,
the largest Regional Bell Operating Company (RBOC) by access lines, and TCI,
the largest cable television operator, gives succour to Mr Rubin. But even
he went on to predict that 10 years hence Nynex could be drawing 'between a
quarter and a half' of its revenues from overseas operations. At the very
least, the Baby Bells are going to be doing 'same business' on a far broader
canvas than now.
The RBOCs face a threefold challenge: regulatory reform at home;
technological advance, bringing new media (such as cellular and broadband)
on stream and promoting convergence between the existing media of telecoms,
computing and entertainment; and international liberalisation, opening up
the world to US telecoms operators of all kinds as never before.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of US Communications (5): Legislation may end easy
life - Regulation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs) have lived a fairly sheltered
first decade. Hived off from AT&amp;T upon the divestiture of 'Ma Bell' in 1984,
they retained their local monopolies while AT&amp;T slogged it out in the
long-distance market with MCI, Sprint and others. Benefiting from generous
access payments from the long- distance carriers on the one hand, and
guaranteed minimum rates of return by state regulators on the other, they
have had an easy and affluent decade.
Some have had it better than others, depending largely on the relationship
with their local state regulators. But none has faced competitive challenges
on a par with AT&amp;T in the long-distance market.
That looks set to change. Legislation now before Congress, which appears
likely to pass into law, would repeal the cable-telephone cross-ownership
rules, allow the RBOCs to compete in the long-distance market, pre-empt
state laws that prohibit entry into local telephone networks (so that local
phone competition becomes federal policy), and compel the RBOCs and other
local operators - of which there are more than 1,000, most of them tiny - to
provide newcomers with equal access to, and inter-connection with, their
networks.
For the RBOCs the key legislation is the Markey-Fields Bill covering local
access, which would enforce local competition, allow RBOCs to buy cable
cable systems outside their areas and upgrade them for telephony, while
banning them from buying cable systems within their service areas. They
would, however, be allowed to upgrade their existing networks to offer
broadband services - very likely in competition with another broadband local
operator.
Assuming that the legislation passes, the RBOCs are more or less obliged to
pursue three policies. First, to upgrade their existing networks to offer
broadband services. Second, to enter into partnerships with cable companies
to offer broadband services elsewhere. And third, to cut costs as fast as
possible, since however friendly their existing state regulators may be,
they will need to be lean and fit for the competition around the corner.
Accordingly, in the past few months virtually all the RBOCs have announced
large investment programmes, swingeing job cuts (70,000 jobs have gone in
the last year), and deals - accomplished or prospective - with cable and/or
entertainment companies to develop broadband. Even as it announced the
breakdown of its TCI venture, Bell Atlantic stressed its continued
commitment to cable alliances working to the same end.
It is not enough to build alliances. A complex process of cable franchise
dealing will also be necessary because of the patchwork nature of existing
cable operations. Los Angeles alone has 40 cable companies while Chicago has
115 franchises. Says Mr Tim Brian, a planning director at Jones Cable, a
cable operator covering 2m homes: 'Almost our entire strategy is to expand,
to exchange franchises and to achieve rationality and critical mass by
clustering our networks.'
Take US West, the Denver-based RBOC covering 14 western states. Last month
the company announced plans to build a fibre and coaxial network at the rate
of 500,000 customers a year from next year. Company strategists insist the
investment is not just about broadband. It would be needed in any case to
increase network flexibility and the services offered to traditional phone
customers.
Last year US West bought 25 per cent of Time Warner Entertainment for
Dollars 2.5bn in a complex deal that will enable Time Warner, the second
largest cable operator after TCI, to upgrade its existing systems and give
US West the opening to export its telecoms know-how to sizeable networks in
15 cities (against the six in which US West currently operates).
Significantly, it is Time Warner's cable networks, not its entertainment
wares, that US West wanted most urgently. The RBOCs' first priority is to go
for each other's core business and that of the cable companies not allied to
them, although in the process they will be building networks able to carry a
new range of services. Says Mr Chuck Lillis, US West's chief planning
officer: 'The Time Warner deal is essentially about giving us more networks.
Of course, they've also got the best studios in the country, and the longer
you go out in time, the more it is about having access to their programming
and products.'
However, the regulatory changes are as much evolutionary as revolutionary.
For all the RBOCs, competition is already a fact of life in the business
market because of the activities, permitted in most states, of 'competitive
access providers' (Caps) who offer direct fibre links to the long-distance
carriers for larger businesses in cities. Ameritech, for one, insists that
nearly half of its revenue is already subject to competition.
MFS, the most aggressive and successful of the Caps, provides a local fibre
service to businesses in 14 cities and has plans to move into another nine
soon. Its ambitions do not stop there. It has just started a switched local
exchange service in New York, which it expects to extend it to all of its US
networks later this year.
'We're not content with being a Cap,' says Mr Royce Holland, MFS president.
'We want to be co-carriers with the RBOCs, serving all businesses - and we
intend to be in 60 to 65 cities in the US within three years.' MFS competes
on price and quality, with the second often the more important. 'In our most
successful markets - New York, Chicago and Washington - high capacity
private circuits are often being sold below cost at the moment,' claims Mr
Holland. 'But our reliability makes us attractive to businesses that can't
afford delays and failures.'
The RBOCs have not been slow to take up the Cap challenge. Mr Richard
Jalkut, chief executive of Nynex's New York operations, estimates that the
Caps have taken about 60 per cent of his New York private-line business.
'They have turned us upside down,' he concedes. 'We are doing things now
which we had convinced ourselves three or four years ago were impossible.'
These include the provision of 1.5 MBit circuits within 24 hours, which a
few years ago used to take Nynex six months. 'It has cost us a lot of
revenue, because we have had to bypass ourselves in the dial-tone (public
switched service) business, but the market is growing at an incredible rate
and we are holding our own with new products.'
Nynex has been a notably innovative operator in terms of products. In 1992,
the New York business launched a proprietary software product - Enterprise -
giving businesses direct control over their own network construction. Mr
Jalkut claims it has started to reverse the loss of market share to the
CAPs. It is taking the same approach to the residential market, ahead of
competition. Last year it was the first RBOC to launch a voice-dialling
service, and has a host of new services up its sleeve.
As for costs, back in 1973 New York Telephone had 125,000 employees. Now it
has 39,000 and there will be 30,000 in five years. 'It's no longer a
question of what the regulator will let you get away with on your cost
base,' says Mr Jalkut. 'It's what your competitors' costs are. Unless you
can beat them, you're sunk.'
Another element must be added to the equation - the entry of the
long-distance carriers to the local business, from which they were excluded
a decade ago. MCI, the second largest has already jumped in with an
announcement of a Dollars 20bn investment over six years to build local
networks. AT&amp;T is also there already, through its purchase last year of
McCaw Cellular, one of the largest mobile operators, which it is rapidly
integrating into its mainstream service offerings.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of US Communications (6): The stuff of science
fiction - Technology
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'It's the stuff you read about in science fiction,' runs the voice-over in
Bell Atlantic's latest television ads. All the RBOCs are talking excitedly
about convergence, broadband and multi-media, and rubbishing the plain old
telephones (pots) as relics about to hit the scrapheap.
It is important to distinguish two different processes at work: regulatory
changes allowing companies to offer services over their systems that other
people were offering before; and the construction of broadband networks
bringing new inter-active services on stream. The two get blurred, since the
first process inevitably requires some network upgrading. But allowing
telephone companies to start supplying cable TV, and vice versa, provides
only a small number of consumers with services they could not procure
before.
In reality, however, the upgrading planned by the RBOCs will take them far
beyond the stage necessary to offer cable TV. Indeed, only one of the RBOCs
 -Bell Atlantic - appears to be seriously experimenting with technology that
would simply upgrade existing copper wire to carry video and even that
company's executives privately concede that it is no more than a
transitional technology. The vogue is for full broadband networks, which
appears in most cases to mean fibre to the kerb and coaxial cable into the
home.
The sums about to be spent on network upgrading are colossal. By one
estimate, US telecoms operators are planning to spend around Dollars 20bn a
year between them. But when it comes to identifying the new services, the
picture becomes more fuzzy, once you get past video-on-demand and still more
cable channels.
Shopping and travel services are the most popular candidates for the first
explosion of new inter-active services. Says Mr Raymond Smith, chairman of
Bell Atlantic: '1994 and 1995 will see the first transactional shopping
services - there's already a Dollars 55bn catalogue shopping business, and
the market could grow like wild.'
Health and educational uses also feature prominently in the rhetoric, though
estimates of how fast the market will develop vary wildly. State by state a
plethora of on-line educational services have sprung up, and in the bid to
present themselves as friends of universal service without the need for
unwieldy regulation, most of the RBOCs are promising Congress they will
provide free or reduced-rate broadband connections for educational
institutions.
Mr Bob Fuher, head of US West's multimedia group, highlighted four sources
of revenue as critical for the new broadband operators: entertainment,
communications, shopping and games. 'It's on the information services side
that there's a weak link,' he said. 'We are still searching for the anchor
information services that will attract the market.'
All of the RBOCs have broadband experiments past, present or future.
Accounts conflict, but all agree that the more starry-eyed projections of an
explosion in demand for new services are off-beam: everything will depend
upon getting the services to market at prices much lower than those
generally envisaged.
The RBOCs are also grappling with the issue of universal service for
broadband - Vice-President Al Gore's insistence that there should not be
information haves and have-nots in the superhighway world. Every operator
has its own solution, and it is becoming one of the most contentious issues
in Congressional deliberations about broadband and regulatory reform.
More immediate than broadband, however, is a further competitive flurry in
the cellular mobile business. The Federal Communications Commission is set
to auction more than 400 licences for Personal Communications Services (PCS)
next year, and competition for the licences will be intense. RBOCs will be
limited in their capacity to bid for licences in areas where they already
have cellular operations, but there are no such limits on licences covering
new areas.
A rush is on to form bidding and operating consortia. One RBOC - San
Francisco-based Pacific Telesis - has even split itself into two, moving its
cellular activities into a separate operator which is about to be spun off
into an entirely separate company. That way it hopes to maximise its value
and increase its bidding potential.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of Credit Management (4): Capacity holds rates down -
The UK credit insurance market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The last three years have seen unprecedented movement in the British credit
insurance market.
Despite a string of recession-related claims, capital has been attracted to
the sector by liberalisation. Competition is dampening any increase in
rates, and improved information technology is helping increased product
diversity and sophistication.
According to the The Credit Insurance Association, a broker which is part of
the Hogg Group, 23 insurers - including Lloyd's syndicates - are active in
the market.
Trade Indemnity (TI), which is owned by nine European insurance companies,
is still the market leader with 75 to 80 per cent of domestic credit
insurance, but as Ms Barbara Bennett, the company's corporate affairs
manager concedes: 'There is an awful lot more competition in the UK than we
have ever seen before.'
Changes in European insurance regulations, especially the approval of the
second non-life directive in 1990, allowed European companies such as Coface
of France and Hermes of Germany to underwrite UK risks from their offices on
the continent.
But it was the purchase by the Dutch group, NCM Insurance, of the privatised
short-term export credit insurance arm of the Export Credits Guarantee
Department towards the end of 1991, which paved the way for the most
significant EU incursion. NCM has already amassed a market share of between
8 and 10 per cent of the UK market, complementing its established position
in the export credit insurance market.
Other new entrants include AMA Underwriting Agents, which accepts business
on behalf of the Dutch insurance company, Aegon, and works closely with the
Infocheck, a credit rating agency. AMA has been focusing on smaller
companies for whom the cost of traditional covers can be prohibitive. Mr
Alistair Malcolm of AMA says his company's premium income has risen from
about Pounds 2m in 1990 to Pounds 12m last year.
At a time of increasing claims - insolvencies rose from 28,935 in 1990 to
62,767 in 1992 - the influx of new capacity has offset pressures for rates
to increase and helped maintain stability. Trade Indemnity increased its
rates by about 40 per cent in February 1991.
But rates have barely risen since then. The traditional 'whole turnover'
policies - in which buyers obtain insurance for specified credit limits for
each of their customers - are typically priced at between 0.1 per cent of
turnover to 1 per cent of turnover, with the bulk falling between the 0.3
and 0.6 range, depending on the sector in which the buyer operates and the
adequacy of their credit management.
At the low risk end of the market are companies in sectors such as
advertising, whose customers tend to be dispersed across a wide range of
sectors and who therefore have little concentrated exposure. On the other
hand businesses such as timber, construction and furniture tend to be
notoriously susceptible to cyclical pressures and there businesses can pay
more.
Rates also vary according to other factors such as the dependence of a
company on a relatively small number of customers, while insurers have
become much more likely to offer lower premiums for customers taking a more
active approach to their credit management.
'Rates would have been expected to harden (increase in insurance jargon)
with the substantial claims of 1991, 1992 and 1993, but with NCM and the
other companies we have seen the balance change,' says Mr Bryan Squibb,
marketing director with CIA. 'There is a lot of value for money in there.'
Johnson &amp; Higgins, the insurance broker, go further in its annual insurance
market overview, arguing that 'there is evidence that a 'price war' may be
beginning in credit insurance.'
Moreover, the extra competition, combined with the greater sophistication of
information, has also stimulated underwriters to offer a wider range of
covers and number of relatively new and more sophisticated products.
'The philosophy has changed,' explains Mr Squibb. 'Over the last three to
four years the buyer has become much more aware of what is possible.'
Both the traditional and newer markets are also selling more catastrophe
insurance policies - which covers all losses above an excess point or limit
higher than those available in traditional policies. These policies are
centred around the policy holder's existing in-house credit controls and
depend on a complete integration of credit management and credit insurance.
The newer catastrophe type policy is particularly appropriate for larger
companies - with turnovers in excess of Pounds 100m. Innovations such as the
self explanatory 'pre-delivery risk' policies and the 'multi-market'
policies - which provide a combination of export credit and domestic trade
credit insurance to companies trading in the UK and most OECD markets - are
also becoming more common.
Yet despite this proliferation of policies, the market remains a limited
one. In manufacturing a sales ledger can amount to 40 per cent of current
assets; while in service industries it can easily be as high as 90 per cent,
yet - according to some estimates - only about 15 per cent of eligible
turnover is insured.
There are some signs that the market for credit insurance is beginning to
increase. Market research by one recent entrant into the UK market indicates
that the take-up by British business has increased sharply over the past 18
months, with the numbers of companies buying credit insurance increasing
from about 10 per cent in June 1992 to 24 per cent in December 1993.
However, other insurers disagree, suggesting that this assessment is over
bullish. Ms Bennett says: 'It is starting to creep up marginally, possibly
as a result of the extra competition.'
Mr Squibb says that interest is increasing but that the rise has been offset
by the increase in the number of companies who are buying more financial
information rather than renewing their credit insurance policies.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of Credit Management (5): 'All you had to do was go
and shoot the breeze' - Ben Allen, of the Association of British Factors and
Discounters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Cilla Black, the pop singer and TV personality, had been in the dating
game back in 1966 she might well have met Ben Allen, Britain's first man to
wed the woman he met through a dating agency. The event was front page news
throughout the UK for days.
Ben Allen, now 53, has achieved prominence almost 28 years later for an
entirely different reason. He is the enthusiastic voice of factoring: the
industry spokesman and new chairman of the Association of British Factors
and Discounters (ABFD). Allen is also a founder and managing director of the
ABFD's fourth largest factoring firm, Kellock.
Factoring has been in his blood for almost 25 years, ever since he applied
for a job under the misconception that he would be working for tea
merchants. 'I thought factors were people who bought and sold things,' he
admits. 'My father called himself a leather factor and he bought and sold
leather.'
Instead, Allen found himself shortlisted for a job as financial controller
with a small factoring firm, then owned by a tea company. In spite of being
unmasked at the final interview, when he quizzed his interviewer on
conditions of the tea trade in India, Allen got the job and discovered a new
passion.
'Suddenly I was making a big contribution to a company, which is exactly
what I had always wanted.'
After a couple of years, the restless Allen was appointed commercial
director to look after new business, at a time when factoring was not
understood. 'I thought it was the most wonderful job. All you had to do was
go and shoot the breeze with people and tell them about something about
which they knew nothing. You could see the scales fall off their eyes, and
it worked. I have been doing it ever since.'
Allen also learned one of his most valuable lessons at the firm during the
recession of the mid 1970s: too much business and too little funding spell
disaster for many smaller companies. 'I had to get rid of some of the
largest clients,' he says. 'It was a very sad time for a company, that was
doing well, to cut back. And, of course, that is the very thing all of our
clients find themselves doing when they cannot get the money to go forward.'
In the end, the business which he had helped to build was sold to Lloyds
Bank.
Allen soon struck out on his own. With Nick Oppenheim, the entrepreneur, he
set up Kellocks. Oppenheim provided the finance and Allen the 'people
skills'. He is convinced that the reason for the success of Kellocks, which
is now owned by the Bank of Scotland, has been in establishing personal
relationships with those who have need of his services. In fact, he regards
himself as the reincarnation of a now largely extinct breed. 'We are the
old-fashioned bank manager - someone the client can go and talk to.'
Such thoughts form the basis of his philosophy on factoring, which to his
constant annoyance is still often referred to as the 'finance of last
recourse'.
'It is disappointing to me that over the past 25 years in the business
factoring has not been accepted more.' He lays some of the blame for this at
the door of the factoring industry itself; it may have made mistakes in the
early days. 'Maybe they took on the wrong clients, or the wrong types of
businesses, for example. Factors were learning their own business at that
time.'
However, there has also been a machismo problem. Business executives in the
UK 'just don't want to give up control of the ledger', he says.
Finally, factoring has suffered simply because often it can help those whom
everyone else has turned away - 'those with weak balance sheets, very weak
balance sheets,' Allen says. 'The waifs and strays end up with factors.'
This does not mean that factoring is an easy answer for a company up against
the wall. On the contrary, Allen says: factoring is there to help small
companies which may have outgrown the bank overdraft, but are unable to take
advantage of other types of finance - companies which may have nothing but a
spread of customers.
Yet - like those old-fashioned bank managers on whom Allen is proud to model
himself - the factoring industry has been hit by the 21st century. In the
last few years invoice discounting (where creditors sell debts at a
discount) has rapidly outpaced factoring as the preferred route for
companies seeking sales related financing.
Somewhat reluctantly, Allen admits that this is where the future lies. 'If
anybody wants to be a player today, they must offer invoice discounting.'
But this sort of financing is not a 'people' business, he says
disparagingly. 'It is much closer to (modern) banking. There is very little
service in it.'
Allen is old-fashioned in other ways, such as enforcing strict standards of
dress from his employees (women must wear frocks, for example). But he is
not one to pine after the past. Instead he is anxiously looking forward to
the future, counting on dizzying growth in the factoring industry before his
retirement in 2001. He cites figures which show that last year ABFD members
lent a total of Pounds 1.6bn to small and medium sized companies, while
collective turnover rose by 23 per cent to Pounds 19.6bn.
'Our year is now,' he says. 'As you come out of recession - when balance
sheets are maybe a little bit weaker, when the banks have burnt their
fingers because they have lost money - that is when factoring does well.'

FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of Credit Management (3): Prompt payment is lifeblood
 -Efforts to adopt careful procedures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arthur Shaw, the builders' hardware manufacturer, paid the penalty for
failing to keep a tight rein on credit management.
The Midlands company, like many others in the construction industry, was
forced into losses by 'exceptionally high levels' of bad debt which
transformed a Pounds 267,000 profit into a pre-tax deficit of almost Pounds
300,000 in the early 1990s.
Claims of weak management control culminated in a boardroom coup by rebel
shareholders, who brought in new executives and strengthened credit
controls. The company has since returned to profit, and Mr Lindsay Melvin,
finance director, claims its has made great strides in balancing debtors
against creditors.
The difficulties of such companies and an increasing number of corporate
failures has prompted business organisations to draw up new guidelines on
credit management policy.
These organisations, led by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI)
representing large groups and the Forum of Private Business acting for
smaller companies, are united in condemning late payments. Dr Ian Peters,
head of small business at the CBI, says: 'Late payments take the lifeblood
out of companies - we have to change that.'
But the two groups are divided on how best to tackle the problem.
The Forum of Private Business wants the government to introduce legislation
to outlaw late payments. Mr Stan Mendham, chief executive, says its 21,000
members want a statutory right to claim interest on overdue invoices. Such
punitive additions to late payments, he claims, would offset the costs of
extending credit to debtors.
The CBI is opposed to legislation. Instead, it wants more companies to
embrace its Prompt Payers Code, which seeks to ensure that payment terms are
agreed at the outset of a deal and that they are not extended or altered.
Although more than 500 of Britain's largest companies have signed the code -
including giants such as British Airways, Marks and Spencer and ICI - Mr
Mendham says it is not enough. Concerned that many small businesses are kept
waiting by dominant suppliers, the forum has drawn up a 'profit builder'
check sheet for members trying to reduce late payment costs.
It urges businesses to track late payment trends and calculate the number of
days during which it extended credit to late paying customers. Companies are
also advised to consider building the cost of credit into their prices or,
alternatively, offering discounts to customers able to pay on time.
The check list also includes straightforward recommendations to ensure
business survival. These include:
Having one person responsible for debt collections;
Establishing a credit worthiness procedure for new customers;
Implementing a follow-up practice to chase overdue bills.
Mr Mendham says such measures are vital. 'More than 80 per cent of our
members say this is a critical issue. The problem is dominant customers
holding up payments. Nobody dares challenge them - because if they do, they
don't get the next order.'
Meanwhile, the CBI has established a working party to draw up a new policy
on credit management and respond to the Department of Trade and Industry's
consultative document on the problems of commercial debt. The working party
will expand the CBI's existing two-pronged strategy of encouraging good
payment practice and awareness of credit management techniques.
It is also expected to demand a British Standard for payment practice, but
stop short of backing legislation. 'You can't have a law just to stop late
payments,' says Dr Peters. 'It could be seen as interfering in commercial
affairs.'
He points out that the courts can penalise late payers with additional
interest charges, and claims that any statutory rate would have to be fixed
at a very high level to dissuade companies from regarding their suppliers as
alternative sources of credit.
Faced with differing recommendations and conflicting advice from business
organisations, many companies have turned to credit management training
services and factors - usually banks - which undertake to collect debts on
the company's behalf and also make an advance to the company of a percentage
of the money it is owed.
Such help does not come cheap. For example, one day's training by
specialists from Dun &amp; Bradstreet International, the business information
group, can cost Pounds 1,200. For that, companies have their debt collection
techniques minutely scrutinised and new programmes introduced.
Ms Judith de Jong, manager of Dun &amp; Bradstreet's business education
services, says a growing number of clients now want their salesforce trained
in debt collection. 'We are training them to act as collectors as well as
sellers. They need to understand the importance of late payments on the
balance sheet.'
That initiative has been taken up by Griffin Factors, the Midland Bank
subsidiary. It has produced a guide to financial management which warns
sales executives that 'a business with the finest product, an excellent
sales record and the most efficient workforce will perish if it doesn't get
paid'. It urges companies to build credit management policies around cash
flow forecasts.
Griffin identifies the 'debt turn' as one of the most important components
of such forecasts. This figure - the number of debtor days outstanding - is
calculated by dividing the value of outstanding invoices by total annual
sales, and then multiplying by 365. 'It can provide early warning of any
deterioration in customer payment performance and your cash flow,' says
Griffin.
The factor also warns suppliers to agree payment terms in advance and check
customers credit with their bankers. They offer a guide to banking jargon -
this ranges from good references to the awful, usually signalled by the
phrase 'resources fully committed'.
Guides to company credit worthiness come in all shapes and sizes. One of the
most up-to-date services is offered by CCN Business Information, which lays
claim to the UK's largest credit and financial information database.
Mr Peter Brooker, director of CCN, say that unlike bank references, it can
offer information on a particular executive's track record - a useful
resource when there are few other details on a potential customer's probity.
The Leeds-based group also offers on-line details about trading and credit
activity of UK companies and a risk index, which calculates a credit score
of businesses based on shareholder funds, liquidity and profitability. Such
services are 'part of the armoury used by credit managers to minimise the
risk to their companies', says Mr Brooker.
All the business organisations, however, agree on the point of no return: if
all else fails, go to court. Legal action, however, is usually expensive
and, fully pursued, may only result in a winding up order against the
customer and still no guarantee of payment.
At the CBI, Dr Ian Peters admits: 'It's a long costly process and despite
assurances from the Lord Chancellor's department, there is no evidence that
it's getting better.
'The best way to avoid it is to plan ahead. That's the essence of good
credit management.'

FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of Credit Management (2): Image problem begins to
improve - Factoring and discounting are enjoying good times
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rarely can the factoring and invoice discounting industry have enjoyed more
propitious times. While the banks have been suffering in the recession from
criticism that they are not doing enough to support smaller growing
businesses, factoring has won an increasingly good hearing.
Most encouraging for an industry that still suffers from an image problem
has been support from the Governor of the Bank of England. Factoring, the
Governor said in a report earlier this year on the relationship between
banks and their customers, was a method of financing that companies should
seriously consider as an alternative to the traditional overdraft.
Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry,
has added his weight, suggesting that factoring is a method smaller
companies should consider to help enhance their performance.
The industry's growth rate, has also been impressive, albeit from a still
modest base. According to the Association of British Factors and and
Discounters, which represents the largest companies in the industry, total
sales factored by its members jumped in 1993 by over 23 per cent to Pounds
19.68bn.
This followed growth of 12.7 per cent the previous year and a less exciting
2.5 per cent during 1991.
Given the flexibility that factoring and invoice discounting can offer small
and growing companies, it is surprising that at any one time the industry
extends only Pounds 1.6bn while the banks extend Pounds 45bn in overdrafts.
Factoring's share of this financing pie is growing, however. And Ben Allen,
chairman of the Association of British Factors and Discounters, thinks the
industry is on the verge of take-off. 'There is always a great demand for
our products as we come out of recession,' he says. 'People have order books
and week balance sheets and consequently need cash flow.'
But demand is also growing because of the attitude of the banks. 'It appears
the banks are finding it more difficult to lend on traditional overdraft
terms particularly to small businesses,' Mr Allen adds.
Some bankers say this reluctance to supply working capital required to fund
growth will persist for some time. They appear to have taken a look at
lending and decided they are being asked to provide what is, in effect,
equity to undercapitalised companies, in return for which they only receive
a loan margin as reward.
Factoring therefore becomes a flexible alternative. For a start, factoring
facilities automatically grow as a company's sales grow, unlike an overdraft
facility which is usually a fixed amount that can only be increased after
lengthy negotiations with the bank.
Ben Allen also believes the industry has 'come of age' recently. His view is
supported by Michael Bickers, publisher of an independent annual report on
the factoring industry*.
'If bodies like the Bank of England are supportive it is bound to help the
industry get over the image problem it has had for several years,' he says.
Yet the misgivings persist. In some eyes, turning to factoring still
suggests an act of desperation from a supplier who cannot find finance
elsewhere. Some companies still refuse to have their invoices discounted or
factored for this reason.
Others say the service is expensive. This is more questionable and often
based on unfair comparisons. The finance cost of simple factoring at
Kellock, where Allen is managing director, is deliberately set at a rate
less than banks charge on overdrafts, he says.
It is the cost of running the debtor ledger for a company - between 0.5 per
cent and 2.5 per cent of turnover - that puts up the price and may make it
appear more expensive.
'Most companies that factor do not have credit controllers so the cost of
administering the debtor book that the factor levies is an additional
charge,' says Bickers. But the company is able to save some of the cost -
or, more likely, management time - needed to run the debtor book.
Invoice discounting, which is used by larger companies, is marginally more
expensive than overdraft, however. This is because the company has to pay
for an audit by the invoice discounter who wants to know the company is
running an acceptable standard of credit controls.
Some companies also say factoring can cost more than an overdraft as the
facility fee has to be paid on the full debtor book, even if less than that
amount is required for part of the time. Factors say that if the facility is
frequently under-used fees can be re-negotiated.
In fact it is invoice discounting which is growing quickest. This is partly
because it is not necessary to disclose the services are being used and
partly because more large companies are turning to it.
'Invoice discounting has become the flavour of the decade,' says Allen. The
market is therefore split between those ABFD members, like UCB and TSB, that
do almost nothing but invoice discounting and the rest that offer both
factoring and invoice discounting.
Where the industry's potential is least developed is export factoring. Last
year this sector grew 36 per cent albeit from a very low level. This trend
is particularly welcome to smaller exporters because banks generally do not
lend against export receivables. Until recently many factors were also
cautious.
One reason demand is increasing is that more continental European companies
have been hit by recession and are learning to pay their debts considerably
later. But the factoring companies are also improving the way they handle
foreign receivables. 'In recent years they have managed to construct an
effective network of factoring companies around the world,' says Bickers.
Most of the factoring companies use a network called Factors Chain
International, based in Amsterdam: an association of correspondent factoring
companies in the main export markets. Of the ABFD members only International
Factors, which is owned by Lloyds Banks and is the largest UK factor, is not
a member.
Whether export factoring really becomes an option for the smaller exporter
depends on whether the banks, which control many of the factoring companies,
are prepared to see a bigger challenge to their existing export finance
business.

FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of US Communications (1): A bumpy ride to America's
superhighway - The US is leading the world into the age of interactive,
multi-media communications. Yet some big questions - technological, legal
and commercial - need to be resolved before this revolution becomes reality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US is in the early stages of a period of profound industrial change as
it leads the world into the long-heralded 'information age' - where
sophisticated new methods of communication will transform the way people
live and work.
Behind the upheaval lies a vision: that in the not too distant future
offices and homes will be equipped with multi- media terminals which will be
able to receive video telephone calls, movies and hundreds of television
programmes on demand. They will allow the user to bank or shop while sitting
in an armchair, play chess with someone thousands of miles away, or call up
information easily from international data bases.
When people are away from their homes and offices, they will be able to stay
in touch by carrying lightweight, wireless, pocket-sized video telephones or
personal communicators, which combine the functions of telephones, computers
and messaging systems.
This vision is hardly new. For more than a decade communications industry
analysts have boldly forecast the imminent arrival of the interactive,
multi-media information age, only to find that technology could not deliver
sufficiently exciting services at sufficiently low cost to attract
consumers.
Suddenly, however, this brave new world seems a great deal closer, thanks
largely to technological innovation. Audio, visual and data information can
now be transformed into the same digital form and transported in vast
quantities around high-capacity fibre optic 'trunk roads'.
Compression technology permits the large amounts of information to be
squeezed down feeder roads into the home.
The US is leading this revolution partly because it is the home of many of
these technological breakthroughs, partly because of its fiercely aggressive
form of capitalism, and the fact it has allowed far more competition into
its communications industries than most developed countries, and partly
because of its insatiable appetite for filmed entertainment, which is
expected to play a crucial part in making multi-media services economic.
But where the US leads, the rest of the developed world is certain to follow
 -with American multinational companies playing an important role.
For example, large US local telephone groups are already the most important
participants in Britain's fast-growing cable television/telephony business,
while American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the largest US long-distance telephone
service company and a leading manufacturer of network equipment, aims
eventually to generate half its revenues from outside the US.
However, some huge questions need to be resolved before the multi-media
vision becomes reality in the US, and many fortunes will be won and lost
over the next few years placing bets on the correct answers.
The pitfalls were graphically underlined last month when the largest US
multi-media alliance yet announced suddenly fell apart.
Bell Atlantic, one of the most innovative local telephone companies, had
agreed last autumn to pay up to Dollars 22bn to take over the biggest US
cable television company, Tele-Communications Inc, but the deal collapsed
because of difficulties in pricing TCI, compounded by cultural differences
between the free-wheeling cable company and staid telephone group.
The break-up of the deal underlines that no one is sure what shape the new
multi-media industry will take. The digitisation of information means that
at least seven industries which were previously separate - some for
technical reasons, others because of regulatory concerns - are converging on
the same ground, jostling for position in a world where legal and other
barriers to competition are falling fast.
They are: long-distance telephony, local telephone services, cable
television, broadcasting, personal computing, wireless communications, and
publishing.
The industries best placed to distribute the new multi-media services are
two traditionally monopolistic sectors with existing information service
wires going into houses and office blocks: the local telephone companies,
notably the seven so-called Baby Bell regional operators which were spun off
from AT&amp;T in 1984, and the cable television businesses which cover some 60
per cent of US homes.
The electrical supply industry, which has a power line running into every
building, is also debating how to take advantage of the revolution.
The local phone and cable companies, after spending years eyeing each other
as potential enemies, have now started joining forces - and invading the
territory of rival local phone companies.
Competition is also being created by the entry of new participants to the
local telephone market: AT&amp;T, the largest long-distance carrier, is buying
McCaw Cellular, the largest non-Bell cellular telephone company. MCI
Communications, the second largest long-distance carrier, recently announced
plans to break into the local market, in conjunction with various unnamed
partners.
Sprint, the third largest long-distance carrier, already owns local monopoly
phone businesses and cellular operations. And the Baby Bells, for their
part, want to be allowed to enter the long-distance telephone market, from
which they are barred. Legislation on both this, and the opening up of the
local market, is before Congress.
The proposed new order would increase the powers and responsibilities of the
Federal Communications Commission, the national government agency which
oversees the sector, to arbitrate between these clashing interests.
The Bell Atlantic-TCI deal was the most dramatic engagement between local
telephony and cable and its collapse means the two industries could now move
much more cautiously in forming alliances.
Deals that may prove more typical are a 25 per cent investment by Baby Bell
US West in the cable and entertainment business of Time Warner, or the
takeover by telephone companies of relatively small cable operators.
Alongside this horizontal integration between local distributors, a degree
of vertical integration is also under way as telephone and cable service
companies forge links with programme packagers, such as cable television
networks, and with programme originators, such as Hollywood film studios.
These forces have been seen most clearly in the Dollars 10bn takeover battle
for Paramount Communications, the film production and book publishing group.
On one side stood the ultimate victor, Viacom, primarily an originator and
packager of cable television entertainment, with financial backing from
Nynex, the Baby Bell serving the north-east US, and Blockbuster
Entertainment, the video retail chain. On the other side was QVC Network, a
cable home shopping channel, backed by BellSouth, the largest Baby Bell, as
well as Comcast, a cable distributor, and publishing groups Cox Enterprises
and Advance Publications.
There are some sharp differences of opinion within the converging industries
as to how much vertical integration is necessary. Some protag-onists argue
that the distributors do not need to have a stake in high-priced programming
assets.
Others maintain that since no one knows how the industry will shake down, it
is a sensible precaution for them to have an interest in the sector. At the
very least, it gives them access to a core of entertainment to fill their
channels, and possibly a better bargaining position when buying programming
from outside.
An even more important question is how quickly customer demand will develop
for multi-media, and that depends partly on how cheaply the services are
priced and partly on making them easily accessible. The many millions of
people who have difficulty programming a video cassette recorder will need a
great deal of help navigating the information highway.
Demand for multi-media is likely to develop at different times in different
markets. Mr Robert Ranalli, head of multi-media at AT&amp;T, thinks there are
'tremendous opportunities over the next three to five years' in the market
for large to medium-sized businesses, where networking will allow desktop
collaboration - that is, staff in different locations working together to
manipulate data, while simultaneously holding video telephone conversations.
Interactive multi-media in the home and small businesses may take rather
longer to take off as a mass market service - some analysts suggest it may
be a decade or more away - but various popular forms of entertainment,
notably movies-on-demand, are expected to win converts much more quickly.
'Cost is a problem,' says Mr Ranalli. 'The home market will evolve more
slowly because of that. It will take five to 10 years for the
price/performance of the technology to reach the TV set.'
But after many false starts, the information age is finally dawning in
America.
