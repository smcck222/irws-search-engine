Customs &amp; Excise yesterday received European backing to continue charging
travellers value added tax and duty on drink and tobacco brought in from the
Continent for other people.
Ms Christiane Scrivener, European commissioner for customs and indirect
taxation, yesterday scotched suggestions that British consumers might be
able to evade excise duties by importing alcohol or tobacco through European
mail order or courier companies.
Speaking in Brussels, Ms Scrivener said the only case in which it was clear
that cross-channel excise duties could be avoided was when travellers bought
goods on the Continent in person for their own consumption - in line with
the British government's demands.
However, she acknowledged that there was still ambiguity in legislation and
said the issue was unlikely to be resolved until a test case was brought
before the European Court.
Ms Scrivener's comments, only days after other commission officials
suggested that mail order purchases might provide a legitimate means of
evading British excise duties, highlighted the uncertainty surrounding the
implementation of the commission's directive on excise duty, which
officially came into force last year.
At issue is the definition of 'personal consumption'. EU legislation permits
member states to retain their own levels of excise duty, payable at the
point of entry, but last year's directive allowed consumers to evade duty on
goods purchased in and brought from another country for private consumption.
With British excise duties on goods such as wine and spirits significantly
higher than continental levels, the British government has insisted that the
legislation could apply only to individual travellers.
It has set limits on the amount of alcohol and tobacco that can be brought
into the UK.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Independent's founder rolls up his sleeves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Andreas Whittam Smith has decided to take a decisive grip on the
loss-making paper he founded by coming out of his office and editing The
Independent from the home news desk.
After months of talks and negotiations about the future of Newspaper
Publishing - owner of The Independent and the Independent on Sunday - Mr
Whittam Smith has decided it is time to roll up his sleeves and work his way
out of trouble.
For the past 10 days he has been on the news desk, briefing reporters and
choosing stories, and he intends to stay there for some time.
'The home news desk is the driving force of the paper,' says Mr Whittam
Smith, conceding that perhaps he was better at working with words and
pictures than issuing generalisations and grand statements from an editor's
office.
After a long spell on the home news desk, the man who may soon be chairman
as well as editor-in-chief, will move on to work on the foreign desk and
even the sports desk.
Mr Whittam Smith was discussing his new role on the day the consortium of
which he is part received the blessing of the independent directors for an
improved offer for the company, in particular a cash offer of 355p. This
values the company at more than Pounds 74m.
Mr Whittam Smith said he would eat his hat if the consortium - which
includes Mirror Group Newspapers, El Pais of Spain and La Repubblica of
Italy - did not take its present 47 per cent stake quickly above 50 per
cent.
However, it may be the week after next before Mr Michael Heseltine, trade
and industry secretary, decides whether to refer the bid to the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission. The company has warned the Department of Trade and
Industry that a further three months of uncertainty caused by referring the
matter to the MMC would be 'seriously damaging' to the business.
Whatever happens, Mr Whittam Smith is going to have his work cut out. Last
month Independent sales settled at about 285,000 with the Independent on
Sunday selling about 350,000. Losses in the financial year to September
could be between Pounds 10m and Pounds 12m compared with Pounds 480,000 last
year.
The independent directors, however, are pleased at the price they have
persuaded the consortium to offer, that 'certain pledges' have been made
about editorial independence and that redundancy terms will be those
generally available at Newspaper Publishing over the past three years.
MGN, which could end up with between 25 per cent and 30 per cent of the
company, will have a detailed service contract to provide all the needs of
Newspaper Publishing including printing, excluding editorial, and what Mr
Whittam Smith calls the company's 'marketing brain'.
MGN will be paid according to running costs, spread across all the national
titles of the two organisations rather than a fixed annual fee. There will
be penalty clauses for failure to meet performance targets.
About 120 redundancies are expected at Newspaper Publishing among
non-editorial staff. The company also said it had sought and received
assurances that Independent staff would be given an equal opportunity with
existing MGN staff for new jobs under the pooled organisation.
The position of Mr Tony O'Reilly whose Independent Newspapers group of
Ireland holds 29.99 per cent, is another uncertainty although the company is
expected to keep its stake as the largest individual shareholder.
The mood of Independent journalists, worried about whether guarantees of
editorial independence could really be believed, was described yesterday as
'very glum'.
But Mr Whittam Smith was much more optimistic. 'I think the future is going
to be one of steady improvement,' he said.

FT  03 MAR 94 / SmithKline shuts plant and warns of further closures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Healthcare group SmithKline Beecham is to shut a plant in St Helens,
Merseyside, and warned yesterday that further closures were possible. Some
production will be switched to contractors for the first time in the UK.
Most of the 480 workers at the plant, which makes non-prescription
medicines, will be made redundant when it closes at the end of the year,
cutting the company's 4,500-strong UK manufacturing payroll by more than 10
per cent.
The shutdown is the result of 'an extensive review' of all SmithKline
Beecham's UK production sites and will end the Beecham family's 150-year
association with St Helens.
The company said that announcements on the future of other manufacturing
sites as a result of the review were planned. The closure is part of
SmithKline Beecham's drift from consumer goods towards Higher specification
healthcare products for sale in pharmacies and available on prescription.
Its biggest selling products are antibiotics and ulcer treatments which
between them have sales of about Pounds 1.5bn a year. But the company is
fighting to improve profits in the face of global healthcare reforms which
have seen cuts in the price of drugs as governments move to control
healthcare spending.
Last year the company sold its personal care products division, a move which
cut production at St Helens by 30 per cent. Output will be further reduced
by the sale, announced yesterday, of seven more brands, including dietary
supplement Phyllosan and Fynnon Salts for baths.
The company said falling production at St Helens had reduced the
competitiveness of the site's remaining manufacturing activities.
The use of an outside contract manufacturer was a first in the UK,
SmithKline said.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Red Star shake-up will cost 500 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Red Star, British Rail's express parcels service, is to shed 40 per cent of
its workforce and more than 30 per cent of its activities in an attempt to
make it more attractive to possible buyers.
The company, which lost Pounds 9m last year on turnover of Pounds 43m, was
put up for sale in June 1993 but withdrawn in December because no
satisfactory offer had been made. BR now hopes to complete its restructuring
by the end of May and sell the business off later this year.
Red Star will shed about 500 of its 1,280 staff, mostly by voluntary
redundancy and natural wastage but also by the offer of alternative jobs.
When the company was first put up for sale 450 staff said they were
interested in voluntary redundancy. Most of the staff to go will be in
administrative and management positions. Red Star said it had already
consulted the unions.
Red Star will drop two of its high-volume but low-value services which
promise next-day delivery by 12 noon and 5.30pm. It will concentrate on its
same-day and early-next-day delivery services which are more profitable.
As part of the restructuring Red Star will simplify its regional
organisation, replacing the existing three regions and 11 areas with five
newly created districts. Railtrack, the state-owned company set up to take
over responsibility for BR's track and signalling in April, will inherit
Pounds 2bn worth of BR debt, Mr Bob Horton, Railtrack chairman, said
yesterday.
Railtrack will have to achieve a return on its Pounds 6.5bn of assets which
will allow it to service that debt, Mr Horton told a conference of the Bow
Group, a Conservative think-tank. It has already been set a target by the
government of a 5.6 per cent return, rising to 8 per cent after four years.
Railtrack has yet to decide whether to continue to service the debt or make
an early repayment, the company said.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, last month said Railtrack expected
to levy track charges of Pounds 2.2bn on train operating companies. That
would be matched by Treasury subsidies.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Three to be jailed over engineering bribes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The long-running series of prosecutions over corruption in the engineering
industry is set to end today with the jailing of three businessmen who
admitted accepting bribes to help companies win valuable contracts.
Mr Robert Wilcox and Mr Colin Read, both former employees of NEI Thompson
Kennicott, and Mr Donald Richards, head of Donnar Services, a marketing
company, had pleaded guilty to various charges of conspiracy to corrupt over
the awarding of 13 contracts. The bulk of these were sub-contracts awarded
by NEI which had won contracts for engineering work on the Sizewell B and
Drax power stations.
Yesterday, at Southwark Crown Court, Judge Valerie Pearlman said she would
sentence the three men later today. In releasing them on bail, she warned
she would impose immediate prison sentences.
The sentencing will end the series of investigations into the use of bribes
to undermine the tendering systems for important engineering contracts. This
has also included investigations into contracts awarded by BP and Shell for
engineering work in the North Sea and to TransMarche Link (TML) for work on
the Channel tunnel.
The investigations by the Serious Fraud Office have centred on the role of
middlemen to bribe company employees into releasing confidential information
about bids for tenders. The information was then sold to other bidders who
were able to win contracts by underbidding their rivals.
Yesterday Mr Stephen Batten QC, for the SFO, said that Mr Richards had set
up his own company, Donnar Services, which specialised in marketing and
personal services and advised NEI to hire both Mr Read and Mr Wilcox in its
project service and purchasing divisions.
Both men then passed him inside information about bids made for
sub-contracts which he then passed to other bidders. One company which
benefited from the information was Scomark Engineering of Burton-on-Trent.
Mr Wilcox received Pounds 32,832 for the information and Mr Read Pounds
46,000. Mr Richards was paid a total of Pounds 230,000 by those he acted
for.
The series of investigations began when the police started inquiries into
the activities of one middleman, Mr Jozef Szrajber. Police raided his home
and found documents which revealed details of a network of similar
'information-brokers' operating throughout the industry.
Of 13 individuals eventually prosecuted, 10 were convicted, including Mr
Szrajber. His records also enabled police to uncover similar corruption in
the awarding of Shell contracts. Further inquiries led police to investigate
companies such as Scomark. These eventually led to prosecutions of
individuals linked with TML and NEI.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Hoverspeed gets duty-free licence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hoverspeed, the cross-channel hovercraft operator, yesterday received a
licence for its duty-free shop at Dover - 18 years after it first opened,
Neil Buckley writes.
Bemused magistrates at Dover granted the Pounds 12.50 licence for selling
wines, spirits and beer after it emerged that due to an oversight the shop
had been operating illegally since it was opened by Hover-speed's
predecessor company Seaspeed.
The company does not require a licence for duty-free sales on cross-channel
hovercraft and SeaCat vessels, but had omitted to apply for one for its
on-shore shop. The mistake was discovered last month when police checked
their records after an application by Hoverspeed's new competitor
Eurotunnel, operator of the Channel tunnel, for a licence to run a duty-free
shop at nearby Folkestone.
Mrs Vivien Judd, a Dover magistrate, criticised police and asked for a
written report on why the company was allowed to continue trading after the
mistake was discovered.
Mr James Rankin, for Hoverspeed, apologised to magistrates for the lateness
of the application 'which should have been made 18 years ago'.

FT  03 MAR 94 / 'Golden Quadrangle' united by a desire to make money:
Economic frenzy in a zone of 300m people
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In all, a dog, two chickens and two pigs have been killed and grains of rice
and freshly-cut leaves are piled neatly next to the dog's corpse under the
hot afternoon sun.
It is a routine sacrifice. Some villagers in the Akha hilltribe community of
Paka Sukjai in Thailand's far north are sick, and they have paid the
spirit-man Bt52 (Pounds 1.40) to perform a ceremony to cure them.
Such are the ancient animist traditions that survive among these Akha
villagers. But the region they inhabit is being changed and modernised at a
bewildering speed.
They migrated from Burma 16 years ago to what was then an isolated Thai
hilltop in the Golden Triangle - the zone encompassing the borders of China,
Laos, Thailand and Burma that is notorious for its fields of opium poppies
and guerrilla warlords.
Today most of the dense forest that once blanketed the hills of northern
Thailand has been destroyed. The Thai armed forces have pacified the area
and discouraged opium growing, and have abandoned their military outposts
and roadblocks. A paved road built a year ago reaches almost to Paka Sukjai,
bringing ice cream vendors and the occasional tourist on a motorcycle.
Schoolchildren learn Thai. The village is connected to the electricity grid
and each house has its own meter. Villagers from the surrounding hills, with
insufficient land for farming, sell their services as labourers, domestic
servants or prostitutes in the nearby provincial capital of Chiang Rai or as
far afield as Japan and Taiwan.
The economy of northern Thailand - like the economies of each of the other
three countries in the neighbourhood - is growing rapidly. Businessmen and
governments have started calling the area the Golden Quadrangle, a name
designed to reflect the fact that there are four nations while recalling the
supposed romance of the Golden Triangle.
Any political differences between Thai capitalists, the communist
authorities of China and Laos and the Burmese military junta have been
submerged by the mutual desire to make money.
The four governments have opened their borders to tourism and trade. Last
year, the Burmese junta began allowing foreign visitors to cross into Burma
from Mae Sai in Thailand; this year Laos and Thailand let them cross the
Mekong river at Chiang Kong.
A Thai businessman is building a fleet of fast river boats to ferry tourists
between Laos, Thailand and southern China along the river, and there are
plans to blow up the rock-strewn rapids which prevent the passage of large
cargo vessels.
Chiang Rai's big new airport has called itself 'international' although
there are no scheduled international flights; it is taken for granted that
airlines will soon be flying from Chiang Rai to China and Laos.
The State Railway of Thailand is examining the possibility of extending its
network northwards as far as Chiang Rai. Governments and foreign aid
agencies are building and upgrading roads throughout the 'quadrangle'.
Chiang Rai already has five new hotels, three stockbrokers' offices and the
first signs of traffic congestion, but local businessmen believe there is
potential for much more growth.
They see future profits in a combination of Thai investment capital and
cheap labour, hydro-electricity and raw materials (including coal) from
China, Laos and Burma. They want an industrial estate in Chiang Rai as well
as a university and a railway station.
'These four countries would have great potential once there's a big push in
this area,' says Mr Tanomsak Serivichyaswat, president of the Chiang Rai
chamber of commerce. 'There's a very big market in this area  - 300m people
 -and there's lots of labour.'
Not everyone is so enthusiastic about what is happening. Environmentalists
are trying to curb soil erosion, pollution and the deforestation of
watersheds, and health workers are worried about the spread of the disease
Aids.
Such concerns, however, cut little ice with the crowds of tourists and
traders in the busy frontier towns.
In the Burmese town of Tachileik, across the border from Mae Sai, they are
selling Chinese clothes, dried mushrooms, plastic toys and medicines to
improve sexual potency made from deer antlers, along with Burmese rubies,
cheroots and peacock feather fans. Thailand's contribution includes
cigarettes and a cheap perfume called VIP Boms which comes in a container
shaped liked a grenade.
With China's Yunnan province struggling to find new, southward routes for
its exports to bypass the congestion afflicting Chinese ports and railways,
the activity at such frontier markets is probably only the beginning of a
surge in cross-border trade and tourism.
New buildings are springing up on both sides of the Thai-Burmese frontier,
and one of the hotels in Mae Sai has been aptly named the Boom Hotel.

FT  03 MAR 94 / HK unveils tax cuts package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hong Kong yesterday announced cuts in corporate and personal taxes after
producing a budget surplus this year of HKDollars 15bn (USDollars 1.9bn).
The government had predicted a HKDollars 3.4bn deficit.
Sir Hamish Macleod, Hong Kong's financial secretary, presenting the budget
for the 1994/95 year, said: 'I am convinced that a major reason for our
success is that we have not succumbed to the temptation to spend money
simply because we have it.'
The surplus had been underpinned by strong growth in stock and property
markets, he added. In addition, rising exports had been buoyed in part by
Hong Kong's ties with southern China's growing economy. A further budget
surplus of HKDollars 8bn is predicted for the coming year.
In a surprise move the financial secretary cut the corporate tax rate by one
percentage point to 16.5 per cent. This returned it to the level of two
years ago when, in his first budget, he raised it. He also over-indexed
personal tax allowances, some by as much as three times the inflation rate.
The tax cuts are made against a background of rising output and stable
growth in prices. Sir Hamish predicted that gross domestic product, after
allowing for inflation, would grow by 5.5 per cent this year, the same as in
1993. Inflation would average 8.5 per cent, the same as last year.
The government would conduct a thorough review of company law in Hong Kong,
Sir Hamish added.
It would extend the law against insider trading to derivatives, such as
warrants and stock options.
By the end of the last full year of British rule (1996/97), Hong Kong would
have accumulated fiscal reserves of HKDollars 120bn, some HKDollars 95bn
greater than Britain promised China in 1991 that it would leave behind. His
medium-term forecast for the economy suggested that in China's first year of
administration of Hong Kong (1997/98) the colony's fiscal reserves might
amount to HKDollars 141bn.
Including the accumulated reserves held in Hong Kong's land fund for China,
total reserves would amount to HKDollars 270bn.
In spite of the level of accumulated reserves, Sir Hamish said it would be
wrong for the Hong Kong government to fund completely the colony's planned
airport and connecting railway.
'When a project produces a reasonable revenue stream on which you can
borrow, then that's the right thing to do,' Sir Hamish said. 'I hope that
when (China) looks at the debt in relation to our fiscal position, they will
be reassured.'
Britain and China meet today to discuss the government's fourth financial
plan for Hong Kong's new airport. It provides for a government injection of
HKDollars 60bn in equity, and debt of HKDollars 23bn.

Nigeria accused France yesterday of escalating Nigeria's border conflict
with Cameroon by sending paratroopers there.
'It is a direct provocation and we regard the escalation of the conflict as
the entire responsibility of the French,' Mr Baba Gana Kingibe, foreign
minister, told a news conference.
A contingent of 15 French paratroopers and two helicopters arrived in
Yaounde on Sunday after Nigerian and Cameroonian troops exchanged fire in
the oil-rich Bakassi peninsula which both west African countries claim.
'I hope that war is not imminent. Our endeavour is to avoid war. . . . but
that does not preclude our being prepared for any provocation from France or
Cameroon,' said Mr Kingibe.
French companies have close ties with the Nigeria in the oil industry,
manufacturing and construction. Elf Aquitaine owns 40 per cent of a joint
venture with the Nigerian government producing 100,000 barrels a day of
crude oil.
Elf is also in partnership with Shell, Agip and the Nigerian government in
the Dollars 4bn liquefied natural gas project re-launched this year.

Sri Lanka's ruling United National party gained control of 18 out of 40
urban village councils in the war-torn eastern province, in the first
elections since 1988, when Indian peace keeping troops entered the province,
writes Mervyn de Silva in Colombo.
The secessionist Tamil Tigers who claim both east and northern provinces as
their traditional homeland failed to disrupt the polls despite several raids
in remote areas.
The Moslem Congress, a new party, gained control of six councils. The main
opposition party, the SLFP, won four councils and Tamil Tiger groups won
majorities in 12 councils.

An Indian court cleared the way for the introduction of foreign publications
into India, Reuter reports from New Delhi. The Delhi High Court threw out a
bundle of petitions seeking to stop any such possible move by the
liberalising government. Six newspaper publishers had argued the entry of
foreign papers would harm state security.
However, the judges said the existing policy, set out in 1956, not to allow
any foreign papers into India remained unchanged. They said that if the
government wanted to change the policy and let foreign papers in, the court
could not prevent it.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Rabin rejects PLO's terms for talks: Hebron violence worsens
as Israeli troops shoot dead two Palestinians

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, yesterday rejected demands by the
Palestine Liberation Organisation for resuming peace talks as violence
flared again in the occupied territories in protest at last Friday's
massacre of Palestinians in Hebron.
Israeli troops shot dead at least two Palestinians and wounded some 60
others in confrontations with stone-throwing youths. Palestinians said the
violence in Hebron, where one Arab youth was killed, was more serious than
the unrest that broke out after the massacre in the town.
In Washington, President Clinton urged Palestinians not to abandon the peace
talks, saying to reject negotiations would 'hand a victory to the
extremists'.
Diplomatic attempts to close the gap between the PLO and Israel intensified
yesterday. Mr Karolos Papoulias, Greek foreign minister who is leading an EU
effort to revive the peace negotiations, held talks in Tunis with Mr Yassir
Arafat, PLO chairman, before heading for Israel with what diplomats
described only as 'some ideas'.
Mr Igor Ivanov, deputy Russian foreign minister, also headed separately for
talks in Israel after meeting the Palestinian leader.
Despite Israeli and US opposition, international support appeared to be
growing yesterday for the deployment of an international force in the
territories to protect Palestinians.
Mr Rabin stressed that the tragedy should not be used by the PLO as an
excuse for trying to put the issue of settlements on the negotiating agenda.
Instead, he said, the violence of the past six days should refocus both
sides on the necessity for finalising an agreement on Palestinian self-rule.
Mr Arafat yesterday restated PLO demands for returning to peace talks: the
deployment of an international force in the territories to safeguard
Palestinian lives, the dismantling of some extremist settlements and the
disarming of the 120,000 Jewish settlers.
Mr Rabin, however, said his government would not discuss settlements and
settlers because the Declaration of Principles signed last September had
specifically left these matters to later talks.
On the issue of the deployment of an international force Mr Rabin said he
had agreed to an 'international presence' but not an 'international force
presence'. Officials said the prime minister had in mind a small group of
observers for Gaza-Jericho only, and not for the rest of the West Bank.
Talks meanwhile continued at the UN on the text of a proposed resolution
which diplomats said had been sent to Tunis for consideration by Mr Arafat.
Russian backing for an international force would present difficulties for Mr
Rabin. Russia remains a co-sponsor with the US of the Middle East peace
process. Mr Rabin said yesterday disagreement between the two co-sponsors
could be exploited by the enemies of peace.

FT  03 MAR 94 / New Zealand heads for 5.5% growth rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New Zealand's economic growth has accelerated sharply and is likely to
exceed 5.5 per cent in the 12 months to the end of this month, Mr Bill
Birch, finance minister, said yesterday.
Mr Birch, who is in London on an international tour to brief the financial
markets, said in an interview that the country's 10 years of 'bruising'
adjustment and reform, designed to restore international competitiveness,
were paying off in export-led growth and a rapid rise in investment.
The latest estimate compares with a forecast of 2.9 per cent for 1993-94
made only last October by Ms Ruth Richardson, Mr Birch's predecessor. The
government believes annual growth rates of 3.5-5 per cent are sustainable.
Manufacturing investment grew by 30 per cent last year, industrial capacity
utilisation was approaching 90 per cent, and unemployment had dropped to 9.1
per cent from a peak of 11.5 per cent, Mr Birch said.
Consumer price inflation, influenced by an appreciation of the New Zealand
dollar, is expected to remain around 1 per cent, in the middle of the zero
to 2 per cent range which the Reserve Bank is contracted to achieve under
New Zealand's arrangements for the central bank's independence.
Faster growth has reduced estimates for the budget deficit. Mr Birch said
that in the fiscal year ending June 30, it would be less than 1 per cent of
GDP or under NZDollars 800m (Pounds 310m), compared with a NZDollars 2.2bn
deficit originally budgeted and NZDollars 1.4bn estimated in October. Mr
Birch is expecting future budget surpluses but gave no specific forecast.
He said New Zealand was benefiting from labour market reform - which he
spearheaded as labour minister - deregulation, painful restructuring of
industry and of government spending, and the opening of the economy.
The National party government won re-election only by a narrow margin in
November. Mr Birch said, however, that economic reform had been pursued by
both leading parties during the 1980s and had wide support. 'Now we want to
carry on and ensure that the benefits of those reforms are demonstrated and
captured.'

FT  03 MAR 94 / Puzzle grows over Buthelezi election role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Uncertainty about Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's role in South Africa's
elections heightened yesterday when the Inkatha Freedom party leader
responded angrily to President FW de Klerk's earlier warning that security
forces would prevent disruption of the poll.
'We need to separate the kingdom of KwaZulu from the rest of South Africa,'
Chief Buthelezi told a meeting of the KwaZulu homeland legislative assembly
in the homeland capital Ulundi. The position of Zulu King Goodwill
Zwelithini in post-apartheid South Africa had not yet been resolved, he
said, and called for a separate Zulu kingdom.
On Tuesday, Chief Buthelezi said he was prepared to register Inkatha for
South Africa's first all-race poll, but a final decision would depend on his
constitutional demands being met. The offer was made after talks with his
main black rival, ANC leader Nelson Mandela in Durban.
It was not clear if Chief Buthelezi would go ahead with Inkatha's
registration after yesterday's developments.
Speaking in Cape Town, Mr de Klerk welcomed Chief Buthelezi's apparent
offer, but stressed the April 26-28 election would take place as scheduled.
'From the government's side, the security forces will be used, the law will
be applied. . . to ensure the election is free and fair. The government will
use everything at its disposal to ensure law and order will be maintained
and the elections go ahead as planned,' he said.
The government had a contingency plan to ensure voting took place in the
Bophuthatswana and KwaZulu black homelands, both members of the
autonomy-seeking Freedom Alliance of white and black conservatives including
Inkatha, Mr de Klerk added.
'I will ensure the maintenance of law and order and use all the facilities
available to the state to that effect, according to the threat and situation
as it develops.' Chief Buthelezi told the Ulundi assembly the sovereignty of
the kingdom was threatened by government and ANC 'manipulation' of
constitutional negotiations.

The Social Democratic party, the largest partner, sensitive that the right

At a meeting with Mr Hosokawa last night the small New Harbinger party was

is Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, who was likely to have
been a victim of the reshuffle. Mr Takemura had earlier maintained he had no
personal objection to losing his job.
The upheavals have started to harm the government's popularity, according to
two polls yesterday, showing that support for the cabinet had fallen from a
record high to its lowest since the coalition came to power last August.
Mr Hosokawa is planning an important policy speech to parliament tomorrow to
coincide with the submission of a final Y73,080bn (Pounds 468bn) budget for
the coming year.

Indonesia's trade surplus rose by 29.5 per cent to Dollars 8.66bn (Pounds
5.8bn) in 1993 from Dollars 6.69bn a year earlier, the trade ministry said,
Reuter reports from Jakarta.
Total exports for 1993 rose 8.4 per cent to Dollars 36.82bn from Dollars
33.97bn in 1992.
Imports rose to 28.16bn from Dollars 27.28bn. Non-oil exports increased by
16.2 per cent to Dollars 27.07bn from Dollars 23.3bn.
Indonesia's trade surplus fell in December 1993 to Dollars 548.8m from
Dollars 908m in November.
Economic analysts said that Indonesia was reaping the benefit of a shift
towards higher investment in manufacturing since oil prices had fallen in
1986.
In spite of the good trade performance, there were a few trouble spots, such
as falling foreign investment, which the government was trying to rectify,
they added.
Information Minister Harmoko disclosed yesterday that Indonesia's consumer
price index rose 1.76 per cent in February.
This brought the rise in inflation to 3.01 per cent for the first two months
of 1994.
The government, which predicted inflation for the 1994/95 fiscal year at 5
per cent, forecast the rate for the current year at 4-6 per cent.

FT  03 MAR 94 / World Bank sets telecom aid rules: 'No intention to reform -
no money'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The World Bank will make the promotion of competition and private-sector
investment a condition for supporting telecommunications modernisation in
less-developed countries.
Dr Bjorn Wellenius, the World Bank's principal telecommunications
specialist, told an FT conference on Asia-Pacific telecommunications that
aid and loans had to be 'closely tied' to policies of liberalisation if they
were to succeed.
'No intention to reform: no money - that's likely to be World Bank policy in
future,' he told the conference in Hong Kong.
Dr Wellenius said less-developed countries needed to invest Dollars 40bn
(Pounds 27bn) a year until the year 2000 to build basic networks, up from
Dollars 10bn a year in the 1980s. In the 1980s, only about 15 per cent of
investment came from the private sector; that proportion would need to rise
to half, from Dollars 1.5bn to Dollars 20bn a year, to meet investment
requirements.
'The role of government is to regulate market-oriented solutions,' he said.
The World Bank statement comes at a critical juncture in the development of
telecommunications policies in less-developed countries. Latin American
governments have pursued privatisation, but most telecoms operations in
less-developed Asian countries are still state-owned, with limited
opportunities for the private sector.
Only 1.5 per cent of World Bank outlays (about Dollars 300m a year) is
devoted to telecommunications, but its advice has a strong bearing on the
stance of the private sector and other international lending institutions.
Mr Robert Morris, partner of Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, said
government attitudes to privatisation were 'critical' to their ability to
raise funds.
'If governments just want to raise a few bucks to reduce the national
deficit, that's not a compelling reason to invest in the industry when there
are lots of other privatisation opportunities available worldwide.'
Mr Simeon Kintanar, head of the Philippines telecommunications commission,
said his country, which has barely 1m lines for its 70m population, was
creating a 'conducive policy environment' for overseas investors.
'Our vision is that applications for phone connections should take 10 days,
not 10 years,' he said.
However, Mr James Ross, chief executive of Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK telecoms
group which wants to boost its investment in the region, cited the
Philippines as one country with restrictions on foreign operators, making
investment less attractive.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Earthquake in LA blurs growth data
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Commerce Department yesterday reported weak economic data for
January, but the figures were consistent with relatively strong economic
growth because of distortions caused by cold weather and the Los Angeles
earthquake.
New home sales fell 20.1 per cent between December and January to a
seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 695,000.
This figure was still 14 per cent above the level in January 1993 because of
big increases in sales in the second half of last year.
Personal income fell 0.3 per cent in the same period, but officials said it
would have risen by a robust 0.7 per cent but for special factors such as a
decline in rental income and cuts in farm subsidies.
Wage and salary income rose a robust 1 per cent from December, and consumer
spending increased by 0.5 per cent in real terms, reflecting a 0.9 per cent
increase in spending on services.
Separately, the Conference Board, a New York business analysis group, said
its 'help wanted' index fell from 110 in December to 106 in January.
Other labour market data have signalled sluggish job creation at the start
of the year.
Most economists believe the rate of growth has slowed significantly from the
fourth quarter of last year when real gross domestic product grew at an
erratic annual rate of 7.5 per cent in real terms.
But distortions caused by bad weather and natural disasters have blurred
recent economic signals.
Mr Richard Berner, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, said the
economy was probably growing at an annual rate of about 3.5 per cent. But
this was a 'stab in the dark', given the various distortions.
There was little evidence of higher inflation, he added. The modest rebound
in commodity prices reflected in the purchasing managers' price index
reported on Tuesday was to be expected, given the industrial recovery.

International trade union leaders will tomorrow urge President Bill Clinton
to back a 'global new deal' to create jobs for the estimated 35m unemployed
in western industrialised countries.
Led by Mr Lane Kirkland, head of the American AFL-CIO, OECD union officials
will demand 'a profound change in the direction of international economic
policy' at the G7 jobs summit in Detroit later this month.
Union leaders will urge Mr Robert Reich, US labour secretary, to back their
call for a co-ordinated employment growth strategy and reject current
western economic policies. They want cuts in short-term interest rates in
Europe; a growth strategy based on infrastructure investments; regional
development; targeted research spending; the encouragement of small and
medium-sized enterprises.

FT  03 MAR 94 / US balanced budget law back on shelf
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The proposed constitutional amendment to balance the US federal budget has
been put back on the shelf for at least a year following its failure to
secure enough votes in the Senate on Tuesday night. The Clinton
administration expressed unalloyed pleasure at the outcome.
The amendment was carried by 63 votes to 37, four votes short of the
required two-thirds majority. Some 22 of the 56 Democrats and 41 of the 44
Republicans voted in favour.
The House may well consider the measure later this month, but Senator George
Mitchell, the majority leader, said afterwards there was 'no way in the
world' he would permit a second Senate vote this year, regardless of what
the House did.
Senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader, conceded the issue was dead this
session, but vowed to fight on. 'It's going to happen, if not this year,
next year or the next year,' he said.
Tuesday's vote came as a great relief to the administration, which had
lobbied hard against the amendment on both constitutional and practical
grounds. Current progress in cutting the deficit would be put at risk, it
argued, and important state and federal programmes eviscerated.
The more immediate political concern was that failure to stop the amendment
could set a nasty precedent for the big upcoming battles in Congress on
healthcare reform.
As sponsored by Senator Paul Simon, the Illinois Democrat, the amendment, to
take effect in 2001, would have prohibited a federal budget deficit unless
two-thirds of both houses voted to permit one.
To become law, it would also have required approval by three quarters of the
50 state legislatures.
Conscious of popular support for the amendment ahead of this year's mid-term
elections, the Democratic leadership, under Senator Mitchell and Senator
Robert Byrd of West Virginia, felt obliged to come up with a device to make
a vote against easier.
This took the form of a weaker amendment, proposed by Senator Harry Reid,
the Nevada Democrat, calling for a balanced budget but with several
exemptions from its strictures, including social security.
This went down to a large defeat - 78 votes to 22 - but it provided
political cover for six Democratic senators who voted for it on Tuesday
afternoon but then opposed the Simon motion later in the night.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Mexico bows to Zapatista demands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Mexican government has agreed to meet many of the principal demands of
the rebel Zapatista guerrillas in the state of Chiapas, preparing the way
for a peaceful end to the peasant uprising that began on New Year's Day.
'The formula for peace has been defined,' Mr Manuel Camacho, the
presidential envoy in Chiapas, said after 10 days' talks in San Cristobal de
las Casas. 'The terms of the peace accords and of the end of hostilities in
Chiapas have been made clear.'
The government formally responded to a series of rebel demands in a 32-point
accord, promising to boost housing, education, health, employment and local
democracy in the impoverished state.
The rebels will now return to their villages and consult with their
supporters. If the rebels backed the government proposals, a formal peace
agreement would be signed, Mr Camacho added.
He stressed reconciliation in Chiapas would only be possible as peace
accords were complied with. 'The work of building peace in the villages,
farms and communities is going to be very difficult.'
The government is on the point of concluding talks with national opposition
parties to make electoral tribunals independent of the governing party.
In this way it will be indirectly meeting rebel demands for national
democratic changes not reached in the accord. An extraordinary session of
Congress to approve such reforms will now be convened. The Zapatistas had
seized San Cristobal de las Casas and other towns in Chiapas, in a revolt
they said was prompted by poverty.
The preliminary accord with the rebels helped the stock market recover from
sharp falls early yesterday. The market closed at 2563, 1.9 per cent up on
the day. But the agreement did not prevent further weakening in the exchange
rate. The 24-hour peso/dollar exchange rate fell to 3.26 yesterday, down
slightly on the day, against a rate of 3.10 prevailing for most of February.
Analysts attributed the decline in the peso to the recent rise in US
interest rates and the decrease in rates on Mexican government paper.
Yesterday the steady fall in Mexican short-term interest rates was reversed,
as rates on 28-day government paper rose 20 basis points to 9.01 per cent.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Tussle over US bank regulation continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A tug of war between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board over plans
to overhaul the US's convoluted system of bank supervision continued
yesterday as Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, refused to back down from
his organisation's insistance that it keep its responsibilities as an
independent bank regulator.
Despite a warning from Senator Donald Riegle, chairman of the Senate banking
committee, that the Congress would not tolerate 'bureaucratic stubbornness
where an institution tries to dig in', Mr Greenspan refused to relax his
opposition to the Treasury's proposal to create a single Federal Banking
Commission.
Mr Greenspan told the committee in a hearing yesterday that the Fed needed
to stay involved in bank supervision in order to keep its finger on the
pulse of the financial markets. He also argued, however, that it was
important to give banks a choice of regulator in order to preserve 'the
current invaluable restraint on any one regulator conducting inflexible,
excessively rigid policies'.
Mr Greenspan's concerns were not shared yesterday by his colleagues from the
three other federal bank regulatory agencies. Mr Eugene Ludwig, Comptroller
of the Currency, and Mr Jonathan Fiechter, acting director of the Office of
Thrift Supervision, both backed the Treasury's proposal. Mr Andrew Hove,
acting chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, also backed
the administration plan in most respects, though he argued that the board
should be expanded from the five members proposed by the Treasury to include
the FDIC chairman.
Members of Congress have urged the Treasury and the Fed to come up with a
joint proposal.
In the event of a clash, the Fed currently seems to hold the strongest
cards. Although its argument about the need for competing regulators is
viewed as bizarre by other bank supervisors, it is drawing support from
bankers, as well as the Republican minority.
Bankers have shouted loudest about the need to clean up the four overlapping
federal supervisory agencies, but the prospect that there wish might be
fulfilled in the shape of a single powerful agency has scared many of them
into changing their tune.
The Treasury's chances of winning Republican support for its proposal have
been impaired by the continuing dispute over President and Mrs Clinton's
links to the White Water affair - a murky financial imbroglio with a tenuous
connection to the issue of bank supervision because of the involvement of
the failed Madison Guaranty savings bank.

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Mexican government and rebel guerrillas have reached a preliminary
agreement aimed at ending the peasant uprising in the southern state of
Chiapas.
'We have reached the end of the first chapter of the dialogue of the
reconciliation of peace,' Bishop Samuel Ruiz, the mediator in the peace
talks, said yesterday.
The government responded point by point to 34 of the rebel demands. Except
for those of national scope, such as calls for democratic reforms, there
seemed to be broad agreement on key issues.
The government promised to meet rebel demands for improved housing,
education, health, and employment in the state of Chiapas. The rebels will
now return to their villages and consult with their supporters.
The government is seeking to meet rebel calls for national electoral changes
indirectly through talks with the main political parties in Mexico City.
The opposition parties and the government have already reached partial
agreement on changes to electoral rules, and an extraordinary session of
Congress to approve the reforms now seems imminent.
The self-styled Zapatista rebels seized San Cristobal de las Casas and
several other towns in Chiapas on New Year's Day, in a revolt they said was
prompted by the poverty suffered by Indians.
The preliminary accord with the rebels did not prevent further weakening
yesterday morning in the peso and the stock market, amid investor
nervousness about the country's economic situation.
The 24-hour peso/dollar exchange rate fell to 3.25 yesterday noon, down
slightly on the day, but against a rate of 3.10 prevailing most of February.
The stock market fell some 0.6 per cent to 2,502 on the opening.
Analysts attributed the decline in the peso to the recent rise in US
interest rates and the decrease in rates on Mexican government paper.
Yesterday, the steady fall in Mexican short-term interest rates was
reversed, as rates on 28-day government paper rose 20 basis points to 9.01
per cent.
Foreign confidence has been dented by Mexico's low economic growth, with GDP
rising 0.4 per cent last year. 'Many people bought Mexico for the growth and
are disappointed by GDP figures,' Mr Jay Polaski, of Morgan Stanley in New
York, said. The sell-off was a normal correction in a market that climbed
rapidly in January and the final quarter of last year.

FT  03 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Algerian creditors face long delays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Algeria's foreign creditors are becoming increasingly frustrated with
growing delays in repayments of the country's debt.
This is likely to complicate the country's attempt to reschedule its Dollars
13.5bn (Pounds 9.2bn) official debt with the Paris Club of creditor
governments. Such a rescheduling is expected to follow after it has agreed a
letter of intent with the IMF.
This would lead to a standby loan of Dollars 500m and an oil compensation
facility of Dollars 300m, and would pave the way for France to seek from its
European Union partners a loan of around Dollars 1bn to help support
Algeria's balance of payments.
Algeria looms large in the lending of many western government credit
agencies. It is the largest debtor of Belgium's export credit organisation
OND Ducroire. For Italy's Sace it represents 24 per cent of total exposure.
It is the third most important debtor of France's Coface after China and
Egypt, with a medium and long-term debt of FFr30bn (Pounds 3.43bn). It is
the third largest for Spain's Compania Espanola de Seguros de Creditos a la
Exportacion after Mexico and Morocco and it has the fourth largest exposure
with the US Eximbank after Mexico, Venezuela and Brazil.
Bankers are increasingly sceptical of the explanation offered by the prime
minister's office one month ago and reiterated ever since by the central
bank and the Ministry of Economy that delays were of a 'technical nature'.
International bankers fear the delays point to a deepening conflict between
the central bank, the Banque d'Algerie and the Ministry of Economy. The
ministry has, for the past two and a half years, sought to reclaim powers it
lost to the central bank when the latter was granted an autonomous status in
1989.
Algeria's total foreign debt, including official debt of Dollars 13.5bn, is
Dollars 26bn.

FT  03 MAR 94 / World Trade News: US airlines push for more UK slots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
American Airlines and Delta Air Lines, two of the biggest US carriers, are
urging the Washington administration to renounce the bilateral aviation
agreement between the US and the UK unless the UK grants greater access to
US carriers into London's Heathrow airport. They are also urging the
withdrawal of British Airways' ticket code sharing rights with USAir.
Failure to reach a compromise agreement by March 17, the deadline for the
renewal of BA's existing code sharing rights with its US partner, USAir,
risks provoking severe trade tensions between the two countries.
The UK has already warned the US it would consider limiting some US airline
flights into Heathrow if the BA code sharing rights were not renewed. In
turn, this is likely to lead to US retaliation against flights by BA and
other UK carriers into the US market.
Mr Robert Crandall, chairman of American Airlines, yesterday renewed his
attack on what he considers the UK's 'protectionist' stance towards BA.
'The US should renounce the bilateral agreement to get a balanced solution.
The US should not allow European carriers to participate in our market, by
far the world's biggest, unless we get equal economic opportunities in their
markets,' he said in London.
Apart from more access into Heathrow, Mr Crandall wants the right to fly
into Heathrow from the US and then into other international destinations. He
also argued that scarce take-off and landing slots at Heathrow should be
auctioned in the same way as they are bought and sold at Chicago.
Mr Crandall also attacked BA's ticket code sharing arrangement with USAir as
'nothing but a matter of consumer deception'. Under the code sharing deal,
BA and USAir can market each other's flights under the same ticketing code.
Through the code sharing system, BA was able to market under its own ticket
code more than 20,000 combinations of different destinations from which his
airline was excluded because of the UK government's unwillingness to give
American Airlines broad operating rights at Heathrow, he argued. In a
document filed with the US Department of Transportation, Delta said the UK
government 'has been on notice for at least one year that the continued
renewal of the code sharing authority was dependent upon material progress
on liberalisation in the bilateral negotiations'.
However, United Airlines, the largest US carrier, has opposed a
confrontation with the UK government and disassociated itself from the
intense lobbying efforts by the other two big US airlines.
The UK government and BA have both rejected the US demands. BA said it
wanted its agreement with USAir, in which it holds a 24 per cent stake,
approved in full by the US government but 'not at any price'.
Although the UK carrier favoured 'open skies', Sir Colin Marshall, BA's
chairman, told the British American Chamber of Commerce last week: 'If,
however, the US strategy remains geared to the notion that their airlines
should be allowed to have free pickings in our British market while theirs
remains closed, I can summon up reserves of any amount of patience.'
Sir Colin disclosed that talks between the two governments had taken place
in Washington last month.

FT  03 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Fears grow over revival of Super 301
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday said he was still considering whether or
not to issue an executive order to resurrect Super 301, a controversial
trade measure designed to build pressure on 'unfair traders'. The renewal
would be specifically targeted towards Japan to force it to open its
markets.
Ms Dee Dee Myers, the White House spokesman. said: 'Super 301 is an option,
but no final decision has been made.' News reports yesterday that the
president had decided to reinstate the provision were 'premature,' she said.
On Capitol Hill there were reports that the president would move today after
a meeting with his economic advisers yesterday. The administration has been
debating renewal since the Clinton-Hosokawa summit last month when the two
sides failed to agree on US demands for 'objective indicators' to measure
import penetration in Japan.
There is strong opposition to the renewal by the Council of Economic
Advisers and the Office of Management and the Budget. Sentiment from other
senior officials ranges from unenthusiastic about Super 301 to frustration
over the US-Japan stalemate and willingness to try any viable alternative.
Many trade analysts believe Super 301 is more feared than effective because
it has so many loopholes which the president can use to avoid imposing
sanctions. 'There is nothing super about Super 301 except the rhetoric it
evokes,' said Mr Tom Bayard, deputy director of the Institute for
International Economics.
The measure requires the trade representative to identify unfair traders and
the 'priority' unfair practices to be eliminated during up to 18 months of
talks. Super 301 was employed reluctantly by Mrs Carla Hills, the then US
trade representative, in 1989 and 1990. Only three countries were singled
out as 'unfair traders' - Japan, Brazil and India. Of the six 'priority
practices' targeted for negotiation and possible sanctions under Super 301,
four were resolved relatively successfully, Mr Bayard said. None of them
resulted in sanctions.
Three of those were with Japan which has since then increased imports of US
supercomputers, wood products and satellites. India, designated as an unfair
trader for its closed insurance industry and trade related investment
practices, refused to negotiate.
Brazil has done away with its quantitative import restrictions, but credit
can be given to a change of governments as well as Super 301.
According to Mr Bayard, Super 301's partial success rate is no better than
that of Section 301, another form of unilateral pressure the US employs to
open markets.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Ukraine's Kravchuk poses dilemma for west: He wants money
for reform and stability, but he might not be there to deliver
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JILL BARSHAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk arrives in Washington today to tell the
west: give us money if you want a buffer against Russian 'imperialism' and
stability in eastern Europe.
The trouble is that Mr Kravchuk, if he is to be believed, will not be
president in four months' time. So the west has begun to wonder whether it
is entertaining a lame duck who will not be able to guarantee the promised
scrapping of Ukraine's nuclear weapons nor the economic reforms he wants the
money for.
Ukrainian journalists and diplomats in Kiev are sceptical that Mr Kravchuk,
however unpopular he is at home with the country's disastrous economy, will
stick to his decision not to stand for re-election in an early presidential
election he called in the turmoil of a miners' strike last year.
Indeed Mr Kravchuk indicated on Tuesday that the election, scheduled for
June, could be cancelled if constitutional issues were not resolved first.
Though he repeated his pledge not to run, Mr Kravchuk seems to be keeping
the option open to serve his full term until 1996.
Others suggest his announcement is a purposely timed test of public opinion.
Ukrainians in recent months have been giving low marks to their president in
opinion polls and condemning him around kitchen tables as they have seen
their standards of living decline with hyperinflation, paltry paychecks
(when they come) and an energy crisis.
If Mr Kravchuk's popularity rises, perhaps through the securing of a huge
aid package from the west to rebuild Ukraine's devastated economy, he could
choose to stand after all - a practice reminiscent of an old Slavic
tradition dating back to Ivan the Terrible, when the dictator came back to
power after his people begged him to come out of seclusion.
Thus Mr Kravchuk might also be testing the west to come up with the money to
keep him, their guarantor of a nuclear-free Ukraine, in power. Aware that US
President Bill Clinton wants to encourage completion of the nuclear deal
between Ukraine, Russia and the US, and that Washington is reassessing its
policies toward a more assertive Russia, Mr Kravchuk is trying to get the
best deal he can now.
The new political tactic to gain economic assistance also takes pressure off
Ukraine's miserable economic reform record. Ukraine has yet to take
effective steps in fighting hyper-inflation, privatising its mammoth state
sector and cutting subsidies to ailing, inefficient industries.
The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are poised to loan
Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 738m) but Ukraine is still far from meeting the
anti-inflation conditions necessary to release this money. Last week Kiev
abandoned a brief three-month experiment to clamp down on the money supply
and issued another huge wave of credits, totalling some 10 per cent of last
year's gross national product.
If Mr Kravchuk holds to his word and the presidential elections are held,
eyes are focusing on two well-known figures from the Ukrainian
establishment: Mr Leonid Kuchma, an industrialist and former prime minister,
and Mr Ivan Plyushch, the parliamentary speaker.
Though neither man has announced his candidacy, opinion polls are giving Mr
Kuchma and Mr Plyushch increasingly higher ratings despite their mutual lack
of a coherent economic reform programme for Ukraine.
Mr Kuchma, who enjoys much support from Ukraine's ailing state enterprises,
has expressed a pro-nuclear stance in the past. Last spring, when he was
prime minister, he delivered a speech before a closed session of parliament,
urging lawmakers to hold on to the country's 176 strategic weapons.
During the parliamentary debate on the trilateral deal signed in Moscow with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and President Clinton during the latter's
European tour, Mr Kuchma cautioned his deputies 'to know all the protocols
and agreements being signed' before ridding Ukraine of its entire nuclear
arsenal.
Mr Plyushch, who came to power from the state farm system, is famous for his
skill as a deal maker and for building consensus behind the scenes. He
helped Mr Kravchuk get parliamentary approval for the nuclear deal last
month. If Mr Plyushch retains his powerful seat after parliamentary
elections this month, he may be reluctant to relinquish it to stand for the
presidency, which has a weak and unclear mandate under the current Ukrainian
constitution.

<TEXT>
The Pact for Italy, the centrist alliance of referendum leader Mario Segni,
has suffered a serious reverse following the refusal of the supreme court to
allow candidates in 10 constituencies to contest the March 27 general
elections, writes Robert Graham in Rome. Other parties were also penalised,
often falling foul of legal technicalities that applied to the 155 seats
covered by the old system of proportional representation in the chamber of
deputies. (Under the new electoral laws, 75 per cent of the seats are being
fought under the first past the post system).
The pact, which includes former Socialists, Republicans and the Popular
party (the former Christian Democrats), has been relying on the advantages
of the proportional system to pick up the bulk of its seats. The absence of
votes in these eight constituencies will complicate the task of mustering 4
per cent of the national vote, the minimum required for a grouping to be
included in the allocation of proportional seats.

A senior Ukrainian official denied yesterday that Ukraine had been syphoning
off Russian gas meant for export to western Europe, but said this could
happen if Russia carried out a threat to cut supplies today, Reuter reports
from Kiev.
However, the chief engineer of Russia's Gazprom said this would achieve
nothing as the company would simply shut off these supplies also and Kiev
would face a storm of protest from Russia's western customers.
Gazprom said on Tuesday it would cut off gas to Ukraine unless Kiev took
steps to pay a debt of about Rbs1,500bn.
Turkmenistan, Ukraine's other gas supplier, stopped its deliveries on
February 20 because of non-payment.
Moldova is negotiating with Russia to stop it carrying out its threat to cut
off gas supplies this week unless debts are paid, a senior Moldovan gas
industry official said yesterday. Moldova owes Gazprom about Rbs53bn.

Polish Defence Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk yesterday said he had discussed

Poland would initially prepare observer groups before analysing the
possibility of joining the Eurocorps, he said, after talks with French
Defence Minister Francois Leotard. Mr Leotard said the talks were
preliminary and it was more timely to speak of Polish officers serving as
observers with the Strasbourg-based corps than of Poland becoming a full
member in the near future. The Eurocorps, seen as the future land-based
defence arm of the Western European Union (WEU), the EU's defence pillar,
will become operational later this year with one French and one German
division plus a Belgian brigade.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The west will live to regret it if it lets Ukraine go down the drain, says
Mr Percy Barnevik, chief executive of the international engineering group
ABB Asea Brown Boveri, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich.
Mr Barnevik has just returned from a visit to Kiev where he held meetings
with government and industry leaders. ABB, a leading supplier of energy
production distribution equipment, is involved in two modest joint ventures
in Ukraine and has more ambitious projects planned.
The impending collapse of Ukraine's economy, now suffering hyperinflation of
50 per cent per month, presents an immense threat to the west, says Mr
Barnevik. This is because Ukraine is the world's third largest nuclear power
with more than 170 nuclear weapons and has the second largest standing army
in Europe.
He denied that his view was special pleading for contracts for ABB. 'I talk
about energy not because it is ABB's business but because it is what is
driving the collapse of Ukraine's economy. The cost of importing oil and gas
is double the size of foreign currency earnings.'
He added: 'Ukraine is not a priority country for ABB. But because of ABB, I
have been able to see the situation and, as a person, I felt I should stand
up and say something.'
Ukraine relies on imported oil and gas for 80 per cent of its energy. But it
can no longer afford to buy fuel. Two weeks ago Turkmenistan cut off
supplies because Kiev had not paid an outstanding Dollars 1bn (Pounds 670m)
bill. Earlier this week Russia threatened to do the same.
Mr Barnevik said catastrophe might be averted with an immediate injection of
Dollars 3bn-Dollars 4bn to revive the country's crippled energy supply
sector plus a similarly sized fund to stabilise the currency.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Better exports lift Dutch output: Economic watch
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dutch manufacturing orders rose by 2.5 per cent in January over December,
but were still down 4.7 per cent from a year earlier. The January rise was
consistent with an emerging recovery in industrial output, with the latest
survey of businesses by the Central Bureau for Statistics (CBS) showing
widespread expectations for an improvement in output over the next three
months. The Nederlandsche Bank's January index of leading indicators,
published early last month, also projected that the economy would continue
gaining strength in the next few months. Domestic orders to Dutch industry
fell slightly in January, but those from abroad were high enough to
compensate for the drop. The Dutch economy is heavily reliant on exports.
The biggest increase in new orders was to the intermediate and semi-finished
goods sector, with orders up both at home and abroad in the semi-finished
goods sector. Austria's current account deficit for 1993 was a provisional
Sch10.6bn (Pounds 592m). At 0.5 per cent of GDP the deficit was well inside
the range considered normal, the National Bank said.
The president of the BDA federation of German employers said unemployment
could grow to 4.5m this year, from about 4m in January, thanks to poor
demand for German products at home and abroad.

rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An internal European Union row over how to adjust its voting rules to
accommodate more members is threatening to undermine negotiations in
Brussels this week which saw Sweden, Finland and Austria agree to join the
Union.
It will not make it easier either for the EU to focus on the problems of the
Norwegians, who are holding out for better entry terms, especially on fish.
The apparently technical dispute over the EU's 'blocking minority' voting
system masks firmly opposed views about the balance of decision-making power
between big and small states, as well as tensions between
sovereignty-conscious nationalists and federalists.
Spain and the UK want to keep existing rules to preserve their ability to
block measures they dislike. Currently, 23 votes out of 76 (normally two
large states and one small) can stop legislation in the council of
ministers.
If all four applicants enter, the 16 would share 90 votes, according to
their size. A majority of the 12 want to maintain the carefully nurtured
existing balance between big and small EU club members by requiring 27 votes
to block proposals, a figure arrived at by arithmetical extrapolation from
present rules. It was decided at the 1992 Lisbon summit to postpone until
the 1996 constitutional review any radical look at how a Union set to expand
later into east and central Europe should take decisions.
Madrid accepts 27 as the threshold except when three member states with at
least 23 votes object or even abstain. In practice, this means two large and
one small country.
However, The European parliament, which has to decide by March 10 whether to
start approval proceedings for the new members in time for them to enter
next January, wants to make it even more difficult to block Euro-laws. At
the moment the parliament says it will not put through enlargement if the 12
keep the blocking minority at 23.
The issue has to be resolved by EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels on
Monday and Tuesday, when they will also have a last try at reaching terms
with Norway. Mr Theodoros Pangalos, Greek chairman of the council of
ministers, said on Tuesday night: 'We have domestic problems to be solved,
but they will not stop a successful enlargement.' He may be being
optimistic.
Contacts by telephone and letter have taken place this week between
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, President Francois Mitterrand and Prime Minister
Felipe Gonzalez to try to resolve the voting rules dispute.
Senior European Commission officials believe the UK will budge, through fear
of endangering the EU's expansion. The British themselves are cryptic. Their
position on voting 'is as firm an element as anything in our negotiating
brief', one official said, only hours before Britain caved in on the issue
of agriculture subsidies for the newcomers.
Spain is another matter. Mr Carlos Westendorp, its European affairs
minister, has made clear Spain must get some fish from Norway's rich waters
and its blocking minority formula. Madrid believes otherwise that it and
Italy and Greece, could be outvoted on issues which concern them alone,
like, for instance, olive oil subsidies.
Mr Gonzalez supported this line in a letter to Mr Kohl this week and at a
press conference in Madrid. It would be politically difficult for him to get
neither fish nor votes.
Norway sticks unswervingly to its line: 'Not a single fish for Spain',
leading one German diplomat to tell a Norwegian colleague that 'negotiating
with you is like Salman Rushdie negotiating with the Iranians'.
But some negotiators believe Oslo might 'consolidate' the fish it conceded
as part of the European Economic Area trade zone treaty, which came into
force this year but would cease to apply once Norway joins the Union. Its
battle cry could then become 'Not a single new fish' for Spain.
Some Brussels diplomats believe, too, that Spain could be flattered into
line, if it got its present eight votes raised to 10, putting it on a par
with the other big countries, France, Germany, Britain and Italy. The flaw
in this argument is that two votes added to 23 does not make 27; Spain's
interests would still be vulnerable.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Bosnian accord could destroy itself
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Never before has one agreement, for one part of Bosnia, held out so much
hope for extending peace throughout the republic. But never before has such
an agreement contained the seeds of its own destruction. Such is the nature
of the complex accord forged by Washington and signed on Tuesday between
Bosnia's Croats, Bosnia's Moslems and the Croatian government.
The preliminary agreement, which envisages the creation of cantons carved
out of territories held by the Bosnian Croat and Bosnian government forces,
is divided into two parts: the establishment of a federation in one part of
Bosnia and Hercegovina, and the creation of a confederation between the
republic of Croatia and that federation.
The federation, which still requires agreement on the maps for the size and
distribution of the cantons, comprises:
a central government underpinned by a bi-cameral legislature. The house of
representatives would be democratically elected on a proportional basis; the
house of peoples would have an equal number of Croats and Bosnians.
a legislature which would elect the president and vice-president, each of
whom would come from separate communities and serve for alternate one-year
terms over a four-year period.
a government in which no deputy minister could belong to the same ethic
background as the minister.
As part of the agreement, all refugees will have the right to return freely
and will be compensated for any damaged property.
The more sensitive part of the agreements rests in the relationship between
the federation and the confederation with Croatia.
In principle, Croatia is not supposed to change its borders, thus preventing
it from annexing territories gained during the war. Instead, the
confederation and the federation will establish a common market for the free
movement of goods, a customs union, a monetary union and defence
arrangements. These will be agreed by a confederative council formed of
equal numbers of Bosnian Croats, Moslems and Croats.
UN and US officials yesterday said President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia,
still hankering after a Greater Croatia, will be put under pressure to
accept the plan through threats of sanctions and promises of economic
assistance.
Lord Owen, who heads the Geneva peace negotiations, insisted the agreement
was not aimed at isolating Serbia. 'A final accord will always need
agreement between the three parties.' However, US officials, playing a
pivotal role in the peace process, like the Russians, realise Mr Radovan
Karadzic, head of the Bosnian Serbs, will be loath to join the central
federal government of Bosnian Croats and Moslems.
'Karadzic should not take the view that his self-styled Serb autonomous
republics will be recognised by the outside world, or indeed join with
Serbia proper. These territories will remain in limbo unless Belgrade is
prepared to negotiate an overall settlement for Bosnia - and for Croatia,' a
US diplomat said.
Herein lies the self-destructive element of yesterday's accord. Any lasting
peace in Bosnia will require the Bosnian Serbs to give up the Moslem
enclaves in eastern Bosnia, or else cede other territory to the Moslems in
order to hold on to eastern Bosnia.
But the Moslems, now supported by the US, might use the federal plan to
secure peace in western Bosnia, and then launch a spring offensive to regain
their territories in the east. That would tear Tuesday's accord to shreds.
More crucially, the success of the accord rests on Croatia and Serbia
reaching agreement over Serb-held territories, particularly around Knin,
south-west Croatia, and in the Baranja, eastern Croatia. 'There will be no
lasting peace until Zagreb and Belgrade make their own peace,' a senior UN
official involved in the Geneva negotiations said.
With the US putting pressure on Croatia and the Moslems, the ball is in Mr
Milosevic's court, and Russia's too.

FT  03 MAR 94 / 'Special factors' foil monetary early warning system: Why
German M3 is not quite the trusty instrument that the Bundesbank cracks it
up to be

Germany's vaunted M3, the money supply indicator which the Bundesbank
unreservedly recommends to a monetarily-unified Europe as the world's
trustiest monetary early warning system, has once again fallen foul of
'special factors'.
After ending 1993 at a peak, with an annualised growth rate of 8.1 per cent,
more than 1.5 points above the top of its designated target range, M3
attained a stratospheric 20.6 per cent in January - almost 15 points off the
mark.
The figure, released yesterday, coming on top of bad inflationary vibrations
from the US and fears of rising interest rates, had a dramatic effect on
financial markets. However, Bundesbank directors had already warned that
1994's early figures would be distorted. Furthermore, they made their first
cut in the securities repurchase rate since early December only one day
before releasing the January M3 balloon. It is safe to assume, therefore,
that Germany's policymakers attach little importance to the figure - at
least for the time being.
It is equally safe to assume, economists agreed yesterday, that the
Bundesbank will continue its softly-softly progress on reducing interest
rates. This week's 0.03 percentage point slice off the repo rate at which it
supplies short-term liquidity to the market was widely read as a signal that
further reductions in short-term rates are still on the cards.
The rate at which they come is a different matter. The 'special factors'
which caused January's inflation of M3 are understood still to be lingering
 -liquidity parked in short-term deposits in expectation of rising long-term
rates and heavy borrowing by house-buyers concerned to pre-empt any interest
rate rises. So it could be some time before the reality of M3 coincides with
the lines on the central bank's graphic prognostications for the year.
This is not to say that the routine M3 figures offer observers an especially
clear guide to the Bundesbank's course of action.
The current rate-cutting process started in September 1992, when M3 was
above target and rising. Since then the short-term discount lending rate has
been cut eight times, even though M3 has consistently exceeded its corridor
range apart from the first three months of last year, when a rush of funds
overseas to avoid a new withholding tax caused a dip. The reversal of that
rush was one of the 'special factors' contributing to January's monetary
surge.
A better guide, and the one on which economists base much of their optimism,
is the west German inflation rate and the medium-term outlook for prices.
Allowing for a blip in January, when new taxes and increased administered
prices pushed the rate ahead, month-on-month inflation has been rising at
around 0.2 per cent a month for the past year. Last month the annual rate
was down to 3.3 per cent, continuing a steady decline which has continued
for more than 12 months. Prices of goods, excluding services and
administered prices, rose just 2.3 per cent in the whole of last year.
Significantly, one state, Bavaria, this week announced an overall annual
inflation rate of 2.9 per cent - the lowest for three years.
At the same time the federal statistics office reported a real 1.6 per cent
fall in blue-collar gross earning, the first cut since 1983 and a clear
indicator of fading inflationary pressure from the demand side. This was
underlined yesterday by reports that retail sales last year fell a real 4
per cent, with the retailers' association expecting no improvement in 1994.
Despite disturbances caused by striking engineers and public sector workers,
confidence remains strong that the year's pay rounds will end once again
with real reductions in wages and salaries.
The Bundesbank, not given to extravagant optimism, has repeatedly said it
expects 2-point-something inflation by the year's end, within striking
distance of the 2 per cent it regards as price stability.
But it has other indicators in its sights. While it has openly supported the
government's view that pan-German economic growth of up to 1.5 per cent is
attainable this year, it also has to consider widespread opinions that the
advance will be far smaller and will in any case rely almost totally on the
continued revival of external demand for German goods and services. This
will depend partly on a steady feed of interest rate reductions, to
encourage recovery and maintain a D-Mark exchange rate at which German
exports remain affordable.
Considering this week's turbulent market conditions, the last thing expected
from today's Bundesbank council meeting is a resumption of interest rate
reductions. As several economists suggested, the members might usefully
spend the time assessing whether M3 is all it is cracked up to be, or at
least preparing a sound rationale for their claims that its rightful role is
to be the guiding light of a future common European monetary policy.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Federation may unleash violence, say Serbs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Serb leaders yesterday warned that the preliminary agreement to form a
federation reached by Bosnia's Croats and Moslems in Washington could
unleash a new wave of violence in former Yugoslavia.
They suggested the US was restoring the Moslem-Croat coalition to step up
pressure on the Serbs and stressed the key question of territorial division
among the three sides remained unresolved.
Bosnia's prime minister, Mr Haris Silajdzic, said yesterday that he planned
to meet Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, in Moscow this week to
seek Russia's help in ending the fighting. 'We want the leadership of the US
to continue but the Russian role is important when it comes to Serbs,' he
said.
Meanwhile, Bosnian Serb artillery pounded the Moslem enclave of Maglaj in
northern Bosnia where 19,000 refugees have been under siege for most of the
past year, and pressed an offensive against the north-western Bihac pocket.
UN officials also said Serbs fired on the government town of Breza north of
Sarajevo, while rocket-propelled grenades were aimed at Bosnian positions in
the capital.
In Moscow, Mr Momcilo Krajisnik, speaker of the Bosnian Serb assembly who is
there with the Bosnian Serb leadership, said the Washington agreement was
seen as 'an action against the Serbian people. It is incomprehensible to
form such an artificial creation which cannot last. . . . (and) aims to
isolate Serbs.'
Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, told a news conference in Moscow:
'We welcome this agreement if America helps Moslems and Croats move towards
peace. But if it helps them to put pressure on Serbs and to gain more
territory from them we are against it.'
But the leadership in Belgrade appeared more restrained. Mr Vladislav
Jovanovic, Serbian foreign minister, said that Serbia supported 'every
attempt to stop the war' but warned that the US initiative for Bosnian
Croats and Moslems to form a federation and then join Croatia in a
confederation could lead to a 'further escalation of crisis'.
By contrast, President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia welcomed the agreement
'which paved the way for resolving Croatia's troubles, but most of all the
UNPA zones' (Serb-held areas of Croatia under United Nations supervision).
However, UN officials yesterday said Mr Tudjman had not given up his plans
of creating a Greater Croatia incorporating large parts of northern, central
and western Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Croatian officials say that the US promised to back the return of the UN
zones, part of the self-styled Serb state of Krajina, to Zagreb. But Serb
leaders from Krajina, which covers one-third of Croatia, denounced the
agreement as 'totally unacceptable'.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Hungary will apply to join next month: Growth pains as the
Union enlarges

Hungary signalled yesterday that it will apply for full membership of the
European Union in April, with the support of Germany.
Hungary would be the first former communist country to apply. It will put
pressure on the EU to come up with new ideas for integrating eastern Europe
and could trigger a request for full membership later this year by Poland.
Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president who visits Hungary today,
has ordered a study on how to strengthen economic and political ties with
central and eastern Europe.
The 12 member states and the Commission oppose offering the east Europeans a
precise date for membership; but there are signs of a more adventurous
approach to integration, partly driven by the rise of Russian nationalism in
last December's elections and the upcoming German presidency of the EU in
the second half of the year.
The UK and Italy are forging new links with the six east European countries
with association agreements with the EU, covering a common foreign and
security policy and justice and home affairs. The six are Poland, Hungary,
the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria.
Even Mr Delors, who once favoured deepening integration within the 12 rather
than widening membership, appears to be having second thoughts.
A Polish official said meanwhile that Warsaw was pursuing membership on a
'parallel track' with Budapest. But the Czechs are likely to delay an
application until they have studied how to align economic policies more
closely to the EU.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Europe lagging in drugs research
</HEADLINE>

Europe's drugs companies are losing their pre-eminence by not spending
enough on research and development, the European Commission warned
yesterday.
They are also too small, production is too fragmented, companies have not
yet been able to respond to the single market and have been left behind in
the exploitation of biotechnology.
'It is hard to escape the conclusion that the US, rather than Europe, is now
the main base for pharmaceutical research and development and for
therapeutic innovation,' the Commission said in its document 'Outlines of an
industrial policy for the pharmaceutical sector in the EC'.
The Commission nevertheless backed away from last year's proposals calling
for the phasing out of direct price controls. This is a blow to the EU
pharmaceuticals sector, which has been lobbying against tighter price
controls being imposed by governments in an attempt to control healthcare
spending.
It emerged in Brussels yesterday that the Commission changed its position
following pressure from member states and the social affairs commission. Mrs
Nelly Baudrihaye, director general of the European federation of
pharmaceutical industries, the umbrella group for the sector, said yesterday
there was 'strong disappointment' in the industry at the watering down of
the proposals on price controls.
Instead, the Commission called on separate member states to take steps to
introduce greater market transparency and open competition to boost the
European industry, which has experienced a significant slow down in the last
year and seems set to shed some 27,000 jobs in the next three years.
With European companies only allocating half the average R&amp;D funds of their
American competitors, they are in danger of lagging in the development of
new drugs, the report said. It noted that only two British companies came
close to matching the levels of funding of American and Swiss companies.
'The picture is most worrying in respect of biotechnology,' the report
added, pointing out that whereas half of all new medicines were developed in
the community 20 years ago, this share had fallen to a third, with 65 per
cent of the patents in biotechnology now held by US companies.
The report recommended a greater emphasis on biotechnology R&amp;D, a reform of
legislation guarding intellectual property rights and a harmonisation of
sector regulation.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Olympics hero Norway ponders life in the cold: Norway thinks
again

The EU's growth pains: Row over voting rights; Norway thinks again
After basking in universal praise for its staging of the Winter Olympics,
Norway this week was back playing its less popular role as the most stubborn
of the four countries applying to join the EU.
While Sweden, Finland and Austria each hammered out accession terms on
Monday, Norway dug in its heels on fisheries, refusing to back down on the
now celebrated statement from Mr Jan Henry Olsen, the young fisheries
minister, that Oslo had 'no fish to give away' to EU fishermen.
Norway has already applied three times for EU membership. Its applications
in 1960 and 1962 were blocked by France; then in 1972 the electorate voted
against joining in a referendum following a row with Brussels over
fisheries. That referendum split Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland's
Labour party deeply.
Opinion polls over the past year have consistently shown a strong majority
of all Norwegians against membership and it was against this unpromising
background that Mrs Brundtland once again pointed the country towards the
Union.
All along, a powerful argument in favour of membership has been the fear
that Norway's Nordic neighbours would join, leaving it isolated and
transforming the long, open border with Sweden into a frontier with the EU.
Since last year's general election opinion has begun to swing towards a Yes
vote. The latest polls show support rising to 37 per cent and overtaking the
No camp should Sweden join.
In Vienna, news that agreement had been struck brought a sense of relief,
writes Patrick Blum. Austria's negotiators, especially Mr Alois Mock, the
foreign minister, were afforded hero status in media coverage.
Nevertheless, the outcome of a referendum to approve membership scheduled
for June, is far from certain. Until then, opponents - nationalists,
traditionalists, special interest groups, and most of the Greens - will look
for ammunition in the small print. They may yet be joined by the right-wing
Freedom Party led by Mr Jorg Haider, who said he would not advise a Yes or
No vote until he had studied the deal.
A test of the public mood will come in provincial elections in Salzburg,
Tyrol and Carinthia on March 13. The most sensitive issues remain lorry
transit and agriculture, and the government may feel it has won a better
deal on both than it might have expected.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Markets shaken by German money supply upsurge: Fears of
Bundesbank brake on further rate cuts - Shares recover after early sell-off

The most explosive growth in German money supply since unification in 1990,
reported by the Bundesbank yesterday, sparked further turmoil in world
financial markets already shaken by fears of rising US inflation.
M3, the Bundesbank's most important guide to monetary policy, grew at an
annualised rate of 20.6 per cent in January, far exceeding the most
pessimistic forecasts and the bank's own target range of 4 to 6 per cent.
Although senior bank officials had given clear warnings of an inflated
figure, shock at the scale of the growth and fears of a brake on German
interest rate cuts prompted an international sell-off.
By the close, stock markets across Europe had partially recouped substantial
losses suffered after the announcement of the German data. Confidence in the
outlook for European interest rates made a fragile recovery, but markets
remained wary of a further tightening of credit policy by the US Federal
Reserve.
US stock and bond markets staged the most impressive recovery, after falling
sharply in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, down more than
50 points in the morning, ended up 22.51 at 3,831.74, while the benchmark
30-year bond rallied from a big early loss to finish slightly higher, where
it yielded 6.76 per cent. Earlier in the day, the 30-year yield had risen as
high as 6.85 per cent.
In London, the early fall in leading equities of just over 2 per cent was
smaller than in continental centres. The FT-SE 100 index fell 74.9 before
bouncing at the 3,195 level to close at 3,248.1, for a final loss on the day
of only 22.5 points.
Frankfurt's Dax index fell 2.3 per cent. Paris held its loss to 1.8 per
cent, after earlier tumbling 4 per cent, while Zurich, the day's biggest
loser, finished down 2.7 per cent.
Rumours that several large UK funds were selling bonds meanwhile sparked
fears that mainstream fund managers were joining the exodus from the market.
Price falls in recent weeks have been spurred by hedge funds and banks
trading on their own accounts. Mainstream fund managers have clung to the
belief that the sharp sell-off is not justified by economic fundamentals,
but the extent of the recent decline is now forcing some to act.
'Some fund managers are panic selling,' said one institutional investor.
'They have held on to the fundamentals for weeks, but the pain was just
getting too great.' There were also signs, however, that some fund managers
were buying selectively bonds which they thought had become underpriced.
'Everyone has a pain threshold,' said one head of trading at a bank in
London. 'The markets are just not acting on fundamentals, and that is
forcing a lot of people to re-evaluate their strategies. The problem is that
they are shutting the door after the horse has bolted.'
European government bonds plunged at the opening, after the overnight
sell-off in US Treasuries, and slid further after the release of the German
money supply data.
Bonds recouped some of their losses as traders covered their short positions
in futures markets. But sentiment was fragile and long-term investors
remained stubbornly on the sidelines, awaiting the outcome of today's
Bundesbank council meeting and Friday's US jobs data.
German bonds set the pace, falling by more than 2 points in the morning, but
closing only about  1/2 point weaker. Although traders reported an early
offer from the Bank of England to buy cash bonds from market-makers, gilts
slid in line with other markets but staged a late recovery.
Foreign exchange traders said the currency market was confused with a lot of
'hot money', as investors liquidated positions to cover losses elsewhere.
The trade dispute with Japan also weighed on the dollar, which fell to
Y103.670 from Y104.615, but recovered to Y104.37 at the Tokyo open. The
D-Mark closed higher in London against the dollar at DM1.7037 from DM1.709
on Tuesday, but eased in New York.
Although German-based analysts concluded that the Bundesbank's policy of
hyper-cautious interest rate cuts would continue, they expected the pace of
reduction to slow because M3 would now take longer than expected to approach
its target range. Some said the bank's bland, generalised explanations in
its initial statement on the provisional January M3 figures also sharpened
the markets' initial reactions.
The Bundesbank put part of the blame for the 'distortion' on 'special
factors'. Heavy inflows of capital from abroad, induced by tax changes,
which had boosted the measure's monthly growth rate to 8.1 per cent in
December, were still having an effect. The figure was also bloated by heavy
borrowing by companies and individuals. Instead of falling as usual in
January, bank lending rose DM2.1bn.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Germany set to build 250mph 'whispering arrow' inter-city
train
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The German government yesterday approved construction of the world's first
commercial magnetic-levitation train - nicknamed the 'whispering arrow' - to
run from Berlin to Hamburg at up to 250 miles an hour.
It is intended to cut the travelling time between the two cities from the
present 3 1/2 hours to less than an hour, and give German industry a big
technological advantage in the world market for high-speed rail travel.
The Transrapid project won the unanimous approval of the German cabinet
yesterday, in spite of a rising tide of protest on environmental and
financial grounds. It could still face a big battle for parliamentary
approval, because the opposition Social Democratic party (SPD) announced
yesterday that it wants the new system drastically scaled down.
The project will cost an estimated DM8.9bn (Pounds 3.5bn) in a
public-private joint venture, with the federal government building the
DM5.6bn monorail system.
A private consortium, involving AEG, Siemens and Thyssen Industrie, the
three initial project partners, as well as Lufthansa, the national airline,
and the German railways, will borrow DM3.3bn to set up the operating
company.
Mr Matthias Wissmann, transport minister, said the plan would give Germany a
clear technological advantage over its international rivals in Japan and the
US.
'We will not allow ourselves to be overtaken in this,' he said. 'Germany
urgently needs economic and technological symbols like the Transrapid. We
cannot allow it to happen - as so often in the past - that technology
developed in Germany is undermined by the doubters in the republic.'
Environmental groups have criticised the system as intrusive and far from
silent, urging the government instead to develop traditional rail
technology.
Transport analysts have argued that the passenger forecasts of up to 14.5m a
year - eight times the present number travelling by rail between Berlin and
Hamburg - are grossly optimistic.
Mr Wissmann yesterday dismissed the doubters, saying that the project would
create 10,000 new jobs. He insisted that the state was not providing any
financial guarantees to the private sector investors. 'The state will only
be responsible for the tracks.'
The 'maglev' train is based on technology originally developed in Germany
and granted a patent in 1933. A new push to make the technology viable has
been financed with government grants since 1977.
The trains are intended to run every 10 minutes between the two cities, and
would be held on a magnetic cushion above the monorail. It would make less
noise than a Volkswagen minibus, supporters said.

FT  03 MAR 94 / Hurd admits 'incorrect' link over Pergau
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The government guaranteed Malaysia up to Pounds 200m of aid - the same
amount as pledged to secure a controversial arms deal - despite declaring
that the two could not be linked, it was revealed yesterday.
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, disclosed that the government had
granted the money through its high commissioner in Kuala Lumpur on the same
day that the then defence minister was forced to retract a promise of aid
equivalent to 20 per cent of the Pounds 1bn arms deal.
In evidence to the Commons foreign affairs committee, Mr Hurd admitted that
there had been 'an incorrect entanglement' between the aid and arms deals in
the run-up to Britain's funding for the Pergau dam project. He said the link
had been made between March and June 1988 under a protocol signed by Lord
Younger, then defence secretary.
Mr Hurd's admission came as Malaysia appeared ready to modify its stand
against British companies.
It made clear that the effective break in trade relations applied only to
government contracts and procurements and not to the private sector. British
companies had feared they could also lose private contracts because of
Malaysian government pressure.
Despite Malaysia's apparently softer stance, Mr John Major accused the
country of short-sightedness and said it owed much of its economic
development to British trade and investment. The prime minister was said by
officials to be 'deeply frustrated' at the Malaysian action.
Brussels officials said the European Commission would be ready to intervene
in the dispute if Britain complained about discrimination
Meanwhile, a television show of The Brit pop awards has become the first
victim of Malaysia's trade restrictions against British companies. The
Dutch-owned Polygram Television International, responsible for selling the
show worldwide, said a Malaysian television station pulled out of a deal to
take the programme on government orders.
Mr Hurd told the Commons committee that the protocol signed in 1988 by Lord
Younger 'reflected the Malaysian wish' for British aid equivalent to 20 per
cent of the arms deal.
Mr Hurd said that had been 'wrong and irregular' and had to be untangled.
'The two policies cannot be linked,' he added.
Three months later, on June 28, Lord Younger wrote to the Malaysian
government to say such a link was not possible.
However, on the same day that Lord Younger delivered his letter, the British
high commissioner in Kuala Lumpur sent a separate letter to the Malaysian
minister of finance confirming the UK government's intention to provide up
to Pounds 200m for development projects.
The then prime minister Lady Thatcher also mentioned both the arms deal and
the aid in a letter sent on August 8 1988.
Asked repeatedly whether the government had not continued to conduct the
same policy by different means, Mr Hurd said the two policies were pursued
separately, although in parallel.
He appeared to blame Lord Younger for the 'incorrect entanglement' of aid
and arms between March and June 1988.
Mr Hurd said the then defence secretary had 'pursued it with great energy',
although Lord Younger had failed to clear the protocol with any other
government department or minister. He added: 'The Foreign Office was not
consulted before the protocol was signed.'
Mr David Sumberg, a Conservative member of the committee, described the
original decision to link arms with aid without reference to other
department as an 'extraordinary state of affairs'.

FT  03 MAR 94 / UK faces European censure on workers' rights laws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR and ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government is likely to be condemned by the European Court of Justice
for failure to implement European employment laws safeguarding the rights of
British employees.
Britain's union leaders said an advisory ruling yesterday in infraction
proceedings brought against the UK by the European Commission was a
shattering defeat for the government's policy of opting-out of the social
chapter of the Maastricht treaty.
Mr Walter Van Gerven, advocate-general of the court, said the UK had
deliberately avoided implementation of key aspects of the European acquired
rights and collective redundancies directives. Advocate-generals' findings
are almost always later confirmed by the full court.
Mr Van Gerven said that in translating the European rules into English law
through the 1981 Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)
Regulations, the UK had failed to require that workers' representatives be
designated for consultation when businesses change hands. The UK had failed
on the same point in relation to collective redundancies. Britain was also
guilty of trying to limit the application of the European rules and failing
to provide effective sanctions against employers who failed to consult.
British unions are confident that if the opinion is adopted by the full
court later this year, the government will have to provide workers with the
legal right to representation through trade unions, at least in situations
involving collective redundancies, the contracting-out of services and
privatisation.
Lawyers also claimed yesterday that the UK government could face a flood of
claims for compensation from workers whose rights were adversely affected by
the privatisation and contracting-out programmes.
But the Department of Employment said the advocate-general's opinion held no
implications for UK legislation and no right to compensation flowed from it.
The government legislated last summer to bring the regulations more closely
into line with Europe.
The possibility of the censure emerged as ministers admitted they had
decided against offering staff at DTELS, a Home Office unit due to be
privatised, a guarantee for the protection of their redundancy money if its
new owner became insolvent.
Mr John Monks, Trades Union Congress general secretary, said: 'This is a
welcome statement from Europe and we will be pressing the government to act.
Once again British workers have been shown to be denied rights that are
accepted in law in all other European countries.'

TelecomAsia, the Thai telephone concessionaire that became the largest
capitalised company of the Stock Exchange of Thailand when its shares were
traded publicly for the first time last December, has reported net profit
for 1993 of Bt564.7m (Dollars 22.3m), below projected earnings of Bt878m,
but a strong turnround from 1992's loss of Bt41.1m, writes William Barnes in
Bangkok.
The company, a subsidiary of the Charoen Pokphand group, is likely to report
sharp swings in profits because it will only get a significant income from
its business of supplying and operating 2m telephone lines in Bangkok after
several years.

A surge in sales of mobile phones enabled the Thai telecoms group Shinawatra

1993.
The unconsolidated net profit of Bt1.02bn (Dollars 40m) compared with
Bt683.8bn in 1992. The group's 60 per cent-owned mobile telephone
subsidiary, Advanced Info Services, showed strong growth with a 114 per cent

FT  03 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Aerospatiale wary of superjumbo project -
France's increasing reluctance to continue with joint studies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's four leading aircraft manufacturers are to hold talks in London
today with Boeing, the world's biggest commercial aircraft maker, to decide
whether to pursue joint studies for the development of a 600-800 seat
superjumbo airliner.
The meeting comes amid signs of increasing reluctance on the part of
Aerospatiale of France to continue the joint studies between the four
partners in the European Airbus consortium and Boeing.
France has been particularly angered by the recent decision of Saudi Arabia
to place a Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4.1bn) commercial aircraft order with Boeing
and McDonnell Douglas of the US after intense pressure from the US
administration.
The French Airbus partner also appears worried over Boeing's motives in
collaborating with the Airbus partners on a superjumbo airliner project.
Airbus Industrie itself has suspected from the beginning that Boeing was
attempting to split the four partners at the same time as stalling Airbus's
own plans to develop a large aircraft to challenge Boeing's monopoly of the
jumbo market with its 747-400 airliner.
The Airbus partners including Aerospatiale, Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa),
British Aerospace and Casa of Spain agreed last year to conduct an economic
and market feasibility study jointly with Boeing on a new 600-800 seater
airliner.
The chief executives of the four European companies will review with Boeing
these studies at today's meeting and decide whether to pursue further
studies.
Mr Philip Condit, Boeing's president, recently indicated he expected the
parties to agree to continue studying the superjumbo project. But he did not
envisage any early decision to launch such an ambitious programme at a time
of continuing overcapacity in the airliner market.
Boeing also appears reluctant to launch another costly programme at this
stage because it is already involved in the development of its new 777
widebody airliner, a new derivative of its 737 narrow-body airliner and a
cargo version of the 767 twin engine airliner.
Boeing has also continued its own independent studies on developing a very
large aircraft or stretching the 747-400. Airbus for its part formed its own
integrated design team six months ago to study the development of an Airbus
jumbo airliner, the A3XX, to challenge Boeing.
Although France appears disenchanted over collaboration with Boeing and may
decide to pull out of the joint studies, the German partner yesterday said
it remained interested in the collaboration project.
Mr Jurgen Schrempp, Dasa's chief executive, spearheaded the original
collaboration project between the European manufacturers and Boeing on a
superjumbo. The rationale behind collaboration is that aircraft makers
believe there is unlikely to be room in the market for more than one very
large airliner.

<TEXT>
Australian coalminers, on strike since Sunday to protest at lower coal
export prices, have voted to stay out until Friday, Reuter reports from
Sydney. Those attending a rally in Canberra demanded an inquiry into
negotiations between Australian coal companies and Japanese buyers.
A deal covering Australian coking coal reached in January resulted in price
cuts of 8-9.5 per cent for the year starting April 1. The miners, who say
the cuts will lead to fewer jobs and mine closures, repeated their demand
for a national coal-marketing authority to negotiate prices with Japanese
buyers. Companies say that would be tantamount to nationalisation.
The miners vowed to strike indefinitely if employers took disciplinary
action. Mr John Maitland, miners' union president, will meet Prime Minister
Paul Keating today to discuss the miners' case.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Algeria reduces oil revenue hopes

Algeria has revised down the revenue it expects from its petroleum exports
this year to Dollars 8bn from Dollars 9bn, a spokesman for the state-owned
Sonatrach agency said yesterday, Reuter reports from Rabat.
The estimate is 'based on an average price of Dollars 15 a barrel for
Algerian crude. Our forecast of oil revenues for 1994 will be around Dollars
8bn,' the spokesman for Sonatrach's communications department said.
Income from petroleum exports, which represents more than 90 per cent of
foreign exchange earnings, was estimated at about Dollars 9bn last year but
since then oil prices have fallen.
Mr Abdelhak Bouhafs, Sonatrach's managing director, said in an interview
published by the Algiers daily Liberte last month 'a decline of Dollars 4 a
barrel means a loss of Dollars 2bn'. Servicing Algeria's foreign debt of
Dollars 25.7bn cost Dollars 9.3bn last year.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Massacre takes joy from freed prisoners

Freedom lacked its zest now they had to live with the memory of last
Friday's mosque massacre, released Palestinian prisoners returning to Hebron
said yesterday, Reuter reports from Hebron.
Israel had said it would release about 500 Palestinian prisoners yesterday,
and 300 more by the end of the week in a gesture to calm rage after a Jewish
settler gunned down 43 Arabs praying in a mosque at Hebron's Cave of the
Patriarchs.
A group of about a dozen just-freed young men looked dazed as they walked
down a Hebron street carrying their belongings in shoulder bags.
Hebron was still under strict curfew and there was none of the public
rejoicing that greeted two prisoner releases after September's PLO-Israel
peace deal.
'Of course I'm happy to be out. I have not been free for seven years,' said
Mr Mohammed Ghaleb Gheith, 29.
'But this is not enough, because of the massacre that happened. I only had
five months left to serve anyway.'
Friday's massacre and the ensuing clashes were the worst day of bloodshed in
Israel's 27-year occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and led to a
suspension of Middle East peace talks.
The forlorn little group of men had been driven from Ketziot prison camp in
Israel's Negev Desert to Hebron in a busload of about 30 prisoners.
They were dropped at Israeli occupation headquarters in town and left to
find their own way alone.
'I don't even know how I'm going to get home,' said Mr Gheith.
Most of the men had been in prison for some years and were first told they
would be freed early yesterday.
The group included Mr Amin Abu Argoub, 21, who had served 48 months of a
50-month sentence, and Mr Mohammed Abu Kbash, 26, who had served four years
and seven months of a five-year sentence.
They said all those released were known to the Israeli authorities as
supporters of PLO Chairman Yassir Arafat's Fatah faction, although some had
become Islamists in prison.
They declined to tell what they had been sentenced for, saying only they
were involved in 'intifada (Palestinian uprising) activities'.
An army communique on the prisoner release said the freed men had not 'shed
blood' or been involved in 'terrorist' attacks since the Israel-PLO peace
deal.
Mr Abu Argoub said he was glad to be out of Israel's notorious Ketziot
prison: 'Conditions were bad and getting worse. We were about 25 to a tent
and there were a lot of ill prisoners and not enough medicines.'
While they talked on the street, an Israeli army patrol stopped and checked
their identity papers.
Mr Abu Kbash said he had been happy when he heard in prison last year of the
Oslo self-rule agreement between the PLO and Israel. But he said the only
goal worth achieving was a Palestinian state.
'The Israeli steps, including our release, are not even 1 per cent of what
is necessary,' he declared.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Leon Brittan, European trade commissioner, said he believed China could
enter Gatt this year and trade and human rights should be dealt with
separately, Reuter reports from Beijing.
Sir Leon was speaking after two days of talks with Chinese officials on
Sino-EU economic relations.
There would be complex negotiations to agree the nature of the commitments
more precisely and the schedule of timing acceptable to the EU, he added.
The EU is seeking cuts in tariffs, greater transparency, improved access for
its companies into sectors such as distribution, banks and insurance
companies, and a safeguard clause against surges in Chinese exports.
Sir Leon gave Chinese officials a protocol on Gatt entry with a list of
requirements. China was a founder member of Gatt but left after the
Communist takeover in 1949. It applied to rejoin in 1986.
Sir Leon also raised the issue of what he called serious violations of
intellectual property rights. The capacity of China's compact disc industry
was enormous but in the absence of agreements with foreign companies it
created an incentive for piracy, he declared.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Israel told to start withdrawal by April 13 or risk peace
talks

The Middle East peace process could collapse if Israel does not begin its
withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho by April 13, the original date for
completing the pullout, a senior member of the Palestine Liberation
Organisation warned yesterday.
But Mr Ahmad Quorieh, one of the chief Palestinian architects of the
PLO-Israeli declaration of principles, said he believed the PLO could not
resume negotiations on implementing the declaration unless Israel agreed to
discuss the future of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories.
The PLO also wanted further guarantees by Israel for the protection of
Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.
The assessment of Mr Quorieh, a senior member of the PLO executive
committee, came as Israel began freeing 500 Palestinian prisoners yesterday
in a further attempt to win back the PLO to peace talks after last Friday's
Hebron mosque massacre. The government also offered compensation to
Palestinian victims and said up to 100 Jewish settlers would be disarmed.
PLO leaders in the occupied territories said the gestures were insufficient.
They added that Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, would have to stay away from
direct peace talks with Israel for at least two to four weeks to assuage
Palestinian outrage at the Hebron killings.
The PLO demands for peace talks to resume include the disarmament of all
120,000 settlers and the dismantling of some of the more extremist
ideological settlements such as Kiryat Arba, the 6,000-strong Jewish
community just outside Hebron where Dr Baruch Goldstein, who carried out
last Friday's massacre of 43 moslems, lived.
Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said Israel could meet demands
such as disarming extremist settlers and preventing their movement into some
sensitive areas, allowing the deployment of an unarmed international force
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip for a short period and increasing the
Palestinian police force for Gaza-Jericho from 8,000 to 10,000.
However, he said the government rejected PLO demands for disarming all
settlers and dismantling some settlements.
One or more PLO leaders are expected to fly to Washington within days to
discuss with the US administration the PLO's demands. The PLO was,
meanwhile, hoping the United Nations Security Council would call on Israel
to accept an 'international presence' in the territories.
As the release of Palestinian prisoners got underway, clashes erupted for a
fourth day throughout the occupied territories.
And in a possible sign of reprisals spreading to the west, a man described
as an Arab shot three ultra-orthodox Jewish youths in New York. Although he
was heard to shout 'Kill the Jews,' police said a traffic dispute may have
sparked the incident. No fatalaties were immediately confirmed.

FT  02 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Vodafone firm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vodafone, the UK's biggest cellular telephones group, was one of only a
handful of FT-SE 100 constituents to gain ground yesterday, responding to
renewed US buying and news of further big increases in the group's
subscriber base.
The group said net new connections to its network during February were
36,551 and that it now served more than 1.12m subscribers. Vodafone's
arch-rival in the cellular telephones business in the UK, Cellnet, owned
60-40 by BT and the Securicor group, also revealed highly encouraging new
subscriber figures. Cellnet attracted 39,000 new customers to its service
during February.
Vodafone shares moved up 7 1/2 more to 609p in heavy turnover of 2.9m. BT
shares, on the other hand, suffered from the general weakness across the
market, with the 'old' stock 3 1/2 off at 431 1/2 p and the 'new' 4 down at
312 1/2 p.
An early upsurge in Abbey National, after the bank revealed better than
expected profits and a top of the range increase in the dividend, failed to
hold and the bank's shares retreated to close sharply lower on the session.
But marketmakers were keen to point out that there had been very little
selling pressure in the stock. 'The numbers were excellent and the dividend
was as good as we could have expected, but you cannot ignore a falling
market; when the market pounces, so will Abbey,' was the comment from one
trader.
The shares ended a volatile session 16 cheaper at 489p, having been as high
as 516p immediately after the figures were announced. Turnover reached 9.7m
shares.
Dealers reported hefty selling of the merchant banks late in the session
amid continuing worries about their exposure to big losses in bond markets
incurred by some of the big hedge funds. SG Warburg relinquished 7 to 888p,
Hambros 19 to 385p and Schroders 30 to 1188p.
General Accident was one of the FT-SE 100's star performers, the shares
managing to close in positive territory and 4 higher at 651p, after 661p,
following the excellent preliminary figures.
Lloyds Abbey Life strengthened 23 to 420p, buoyed by a James Capel
recommendation.
An upbeat trading statement from Grand Metropolitan provided a temporary
relief to the downward pressure in the drinks sector, but the shares soon
succumbed to the market trend and fell further during the afternoon. The
stock finished 15 down at 468p after a hefty 8.8m traded.
Among other big fallers, Bass tumbled 19 to 518p, Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley 13
to 506p and Whitbread 11 to 554p. Dealers said sentiment had been hit by
reports that UK consumers will be allowed to telephone drinks orders to
France for direct delivery.
Betting and hotel group Ladbroke gained 2 1/2 at 211 1/2 p on 11m traded on
expectations of good results tomorrow. Joint broker Smith New Court was also
said to be making positive noises. Although a cut in the dividend is
forecast by some analysts, more visibility is also being anticipated in the
first set of results since the group's founder Mr Cyril Stein retired.
Granada was hit by further selling in the wake of its takeover of LWT and
the shares fell 15 to 540p on turnover of 7.3m. LWT slid 17 to 708p.
Market fears on the outlook for interest rates led to weakness in
international conglomerate Hanson, leaving the shares trailing 4 at 273 1/2
p.
Leading pharmaceutical stocks were generally firm on dollar considerations.
Glaxo, with Panmure Gordon positive, rose 4 1/2 to 683p, Wellcome put on 2
at 656p and Zeneca appreciated 7 to 776p.
A profits rise of 60 per cent from Inveresk saw shares in the speciality
paper group advance 7 to 230p.
Dawson International slipped 5 to 153p after the company stated that it was
pulling out of the loss-making US woollen business and would take a one-off
exceptional provision of Pounds 50m for this year.
Furniture group Silentnight dropped 38 after announcing that profits for the
year ended in January would be below market expectations. The shares later
recovered some ground to close at 355p, a fall of 18 on the day. The company
blamed margin pressures for the warning.
Boots was said to have been undone by a big US seller and the shares fell 14
to 532p. Yield buying lifted Dalgety by 3 to 473p.
British Steel declined 5 to 138 1/2 p, with 13m shares traded, after steel
group ASW reported full-year figures below market expectations and warned of
continuing overcapacity in the industry. ASW was unchanged at 190p.
International mining group RTZ was among a handful of stocks that resisted
the market slide, closing 14 up at 867p on volume of 5.2m, making it the
best performing stock in the FT-SE 100. The shares were boosted by a firm
gold price and the prospect of increased demand for copper.

FT  02 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Hong Kong issues fall sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London market's heavily traded Hong Kong orientated stocks were given
the roughest of rides in a generally uncomfortable equity market yesterday
as dealers responded to the 2.5 per cent slide in Hong Kong share prices.
Worst affected of the front line stocks was HSBC Holdings, which followed
Monday's gradual post-results deterioration in its share price in London
with a substantial retreat.
Marketmakers said there was little support for HSBC shares throughout the
day, with the stock price dropping to a low for the session of 868p at the
close to leave a fall of 77p, or 8.1 per cent, after turnover of 6.4m
shares. The Hong Kong-registered stock settled 80 off at 892p.
NatWest Securities was one broking house to emphasise worries about quality
of earnings at the bank which it said could hold the shares back in the
short term.
Upgrading its current-year numbers, NatWest said it expected a declining bad
debts charge because of recovering economies in the UK and US, scope for
growth in net income, and a high level of asset disposal profits. For 1994,
the broker lifted its forecast from Pounds 2.7bn to Pounds 2.8bn, and for
1995 to Pounds 3.07bn. It also forecast a 13 per cent increase in the 1994
dividend to 26.5p and is looking for a dividend total of 29p for 1995.
The fallout from HSBC impacted on other Hong Kong and Pacific Rim stocks
such as Standard Chartered and Cable and Wireless. The former plunged 56, or
4.6 per cent, to 1159p in turnover of 928,000 shares, with one of the London
market's biggest securities houses said to have tried to unwind a big long
position in the stock just before the close of trading.
C&amp;W, the telecoms group, held up well compared with HSBC and Standard,
finishing only 13 down at 460p on turnover of 5.4m shares.

FT  02 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities hit hard by renewed setback
in bonds - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Another heavy sell-off in the bond markets yesterday wiped out the attempted
recovery of confidence in UK equities. Late afternoon saw share prices
tumbling on all sides as global bond markets reacted with heavy falls to a
sharp rise in the February price index compiled by the US National
Purchasing Managers Association (NPMA).
The FT-SE 100 Index fell 57.5, or 1.7 per cent, to 3,270.6, the day's low,
Selling increased as the market fell away but trading volume remained fairly
moderate. With the pressure largely focused on the blue chip leaders, the
FT-SE Mid 250 Index lost only 15.4 to 3,944.6.
The NPMA report was the last straw for a stock market which has been firmly
under the heel of the bond markets. An initial firming in equities was
abruptly reversed by a downturn in European bonds on disappointment with the
outcome of the variable repo tender in Germany. Then came the upward
revision of the fourth-quarter US GDP figure, which gave the first hint of
renewed inflation concern.
But the Footsie was down only 19 points at that stage. It was the NPMA price
index which turned the cold wind blowing through the markets into a
hurricane. As on Thursday, share prices were at the mercy of bonds and, with
stock index futures setting the pace, simply crumpled as both short and
long-dated gilts plunged. Weakness in short-dated gilts implied negative
views on base rate prospects, underlining the reversal of sentiment which
lies beneath the market setback.
A sizeable trading programme, weighted towards the sell side, had appeared
in the market before the collapse began and probably had little effect.
Share quotations were cut repeatedly by marketmakers strugging to avoid
speculative sellers and fund managers trying to reduce exposure.
At Kleinwort Benson Securities, the London merchant bank and securities
house, Mr Albert Edwards pointed out that the NAPM index is linked to
commodity prices, making it a significant indicator of inflationary
pressures ahead in the US. London traders saw yesterday's fall in US bonds
as a sign that prospects of further tightening in Federal Reserve policies
had come several steps closer.
The day's trading volume of 720.8m shares through the Seaq network compared
with 705.2m on Monday, when retail business was worth Pounds 1.38bn. While
there has been no heavy selling of equities, it has been noted by the
strategists that there has been no sign that cash taken out of gilts is
seeking a home in the stock market.
Once again, the financial sectors suffered severely as investors reckoned
the possible damage to the securities trading divisions of the fresh round
of losses in global bond markets. Hongkong and Shanghai Banking, down in the
home market overnight, fell heavily in London as some analysts questioned
the outlook at the Hang Seng Bank unit.
There was little that equity strategists could say yesterday except to
repeat the comments made last week. Many still see the setback as a buying
opportunity, but warn that the market could be in for further shocks in the
near term.
The focus remains entirely on the bond markets, which are expected to remain
nervous ahead of the German M3 money supply figures, due later this week,
and, of course, to recurrent bouts of nervousness that the US Federal
Reserve may be about to tighten credit policy again.

FT  02 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The return of heavy selling in global bond markets brought another slide in
stock index futures, following the release of US economic data, writes Joel
Kibazo.
Dealers reported a dull morning after the March contract on the FT-SE 100
opened at 3,320. Light selling saw it drift gently lower before steadying
over the lunchtime period.
It was the early afternoon release of the US Purchasing Managers' price
index that started the sell off in bond markets and prompted the sharp
retreat in the futures. The fall in March pulled the underlying cash market
lower, though the contract remained at a large discount to cash for most of
the afternoon. Traders said there were few opportunities for arbitrage
trading.
March closed at 3,251, down 69 on its previous close and at a 13 point
discount to its estimated fair value premium to cash of minus 8. Volume was
22,102 lots.
Turnover in the FT-SE Mid-250 futures contract on Liffe was 628 lots as it
finished at 3,264. The same contract on the OMLX traded 117 contracts, with
open interest recorded at around 2,867.
In traded options, volume was 32,799. Turnover in the FT-SE 100 was 13,936
lots and 3,637 in Abbey National, the most active stock option.

Brazil
Brazilian equities closed a net 1.8 per cent higher in moderate trade after
the market absorbed a late profit-taking bout and remained bullish on
economy minister Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso's anti-inflation plan,
including the creation of a new single price index.
The Bovespa index of the 54 most active shares gained 194 points at 10,733
in Sao Paulo. Volume ended at Cr216.8bn (Dollars 335m).
Traders said investors sold on concern that congress would not muster quorum
to approve the promulgation of a bill creating Mr Cardoso's social welfare
fund. But a congressional spokesman said shortly after the market closed
that congress had reached minimum quorum to proceed with the vote.
Brazil's central bank will use the newly created single price index, Real
Value Unit, as a parameter for its interventions in the foreign exchange
market, Reuter reports from Sao Paulo.
The bank said it will sell US dollars in the commercial and the interbank
domestic forex markets at the URV price of the day the deal takes place.
The rate at which the central bank will buy dollars in the market will be
set freely between market players and the monetary authority. The deals will
be settled two days after the transaction takes place.
The URV's value will be set daily, based on the average of three inflation
indices which measure the depreciation of the cruzeiro real and expressed in
dollars.
Mexico
Mexican stock prices tumbled more than 70 points to close sharply lower, hit
by fears of a rise in domestic interest rates and losses on Wall Street.
The IPC index of 36 leading shares ended 71.29 down at 2,514.15, a loss of
2.76 per cent.
Telmex accounted for about half of the total of 90.23m shares traded. The
'A' stock dropped 3.15 per cent and the 'L' shares, which may be held by
foreigners, lost 2.60 per cent.
Of 115 issues changing hands on the wider market, falls outpaced rises by 78
to 15.

FT  02 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Inflation fears prompt sharp
fall in Dow
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US share prices fell across the board in heavy trading yesterday in the wake
of a sharp decline in bond prices that was inspired by fears of rising
inflation, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 22.79 down at 3,809.23. The Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 index declined 2.70 to 464.44, while the American SE composite
slipped 1.38 to 469.96 and the Nasdaq composite fell 3.86 to 788.64. All the
main indices ended off their lows for the day. NYSE volume was 304m shares
and declines outpaced rises by 1,435 to 697.
The day's first big economic news - an upward revision of the fourth-quarter
gross domestic product from 5.9 per cent growth to 7.5 per cent growth - had
little impact on prices. Although this was ostensibly good news for stocks,
analysts warn that these rates of growth will not be sustained in coming
quarters. Also, investors are nervous at any sign of excessive economic
expansion because it might prompt the Federal Reserve into raising interest
rates again.
Soon after 10 am, however, prices turned decisively lower. The heavy selling
was prompted by a sudden and sharp decline in bond prices. The sell-off in
the bond market, which pushed the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond up to
6.73 per cent, followed the publication of the National Association of
Purchasing Management's February report and, in particular, the announcement
that the NAPM's index of prices rose sharply last month to its highest level
since October 1990.
Like their counterparts in the equities market, bond investors are worried
that the Fed will tighten monetary policy again soon. Yesterday's NAPM
prices data, said analysts, brought the prospect of another rate rise
nearer. This thinking, plus the fact that the stock market rarely likes to
see bond yields rising, was behind the declines in share prices.
Additionally, traders said several computerised sell programs executed
during the morning exaggerated the market's downward trend.
Interest rate-sensitive issues were lower. Among banks, Citicorp fell
Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 40 3/8 , Chase Manhattan Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars
31 1/2 , First Chicago Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 48 1/4 and Wells Fargo
Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 136 1/2 . Brokerage stocks were also weaker, with
Morgan Stanley losing Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 65 3/8 , Merrill Lynch
Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 40 1/8 and Salomon Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 49 3/8 .
Federal National Mortgage Association, which has benefited greatly from
falling interest rates, receded Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 82 1/4 .
Digital Equipment bucked the wider trend, forging ahead Dollars 2 1/8 to
Dollars 31 1/4 in volume of 3.6m shares after broking house Salomon Brothers
was reported to have upgraded its rating on the stock from 'hold' to 'buy'.
On the Nasdaq market, Snapple fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 27 1/8 after
Coca-Cola launched a new range of soft drinks under the label 'Fruitopia'
that is clearly aimed at competing with Snapple's own hugely successful
brands.
Canada
Toronto finished sharply lower in moderate trading as interest rate fears
thrashed the bond market - but traders insist a rally is just around the
corner.
The TSE 300 index surrendered 33.4 at 4,390.4 and declines led advances by
440 to 316 after volume of 67.3m shares valued at CDollars 756.5m.
The mining sector dropped 2.1 per cent, due in part to a fall in Alcan. The
stock shed CDollars 1 to CDollars 31 following news that talks about
production cutbacks among the world's major aluminium producing countries
are progressing more slowly than expected.

FT  02 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continental bourses affected
by news from US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Late closing markets were affected by negative US data which suggested that
inflation was rising, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT fell back after Monday's positive start to the week as equities
were again battered by nervousness in the bund market.
The Dax index closed the official session down 24.52 or 1.2 per cent at
2,067.05, and extended that loss in the post-bourse session, falling a
further 46.00 to 2,057.20, as disappointing US data began to make itself
felt.
The Bundesbank's easing of the repo rate to under 6 per cent did little to
excite enthusiasm, coming within most expectations.
Of greater concern to the equity market is unrest among public sector
workers, with IG Metall engineering union members due to ballot on strike
action.
Among the day's heavy losers Daimler-Benz shed DM18 or 2 per cent to DM795
and then to DM792.50 in the after market.
PARIS retreated sharply at the close as worries about the implications
arising from the release of US data took hold. The CAC-40 index, which had
fallen to a session low of 2,176.46, closed off 54.94 or 2.4 per cent at
2,183.12.
Turnover was FFr5bn.
Among the worst fallers Euro Disney shed FFr1.30 or 3.7 per cent to
FFr33.50, Thomson-CSf FFr11.50 or 5.8 per cent to FFr186.00 and L'Oreal
FFr43 or 3.3 per cent to FFr1,242.
ZURICH, mixed early in the day, turned lower after the release of the US GDP
data, leaving the SMI index down 40.8 at 2,847.4, taking the cumulative two
day decline to 2.8 per cent.
UBS bearers, downgraded by a number of analysts after last Friday's results,
fell SFr44 to SFr1,320, taking the cumulative three day decline to 9 per
cent.
CS Holding were steadier after Monday's 5.3 per cent fall, losing SFr3 to
SFr635. SBC added SFr4 to SFr454: some analysts have recommended switching
into the stock.
Blue chips were marked down on profit-taking by foreigners, also taking the
opportunity to bank currency gains.
Nestle shed SFr23 to SFr1,260 and Roche certificates fell SFr100 to
SFr6,900.
MILAN was dragged lower by weakness in bonds and the lira and the Comit
index shed 8.96 to 649.24, with the market also inhibited by the political
outlook in the run up to the elections on March 27-28.
Trading was halted for almost three hours due to technical problems, but
volume was so low that the bourse hours were not extended.
BCI shed L34 to L6,026 amid expectations that the privatisation would be
completed.
Foreign favourites were left lower on profit-taking. Fiat shed L59 to L4,692
and Pirelli shed L88 to 2,061. Among the telecommunications issues, Sip shed
L101 to L4,047 and Stet was L123 lower at L4438.
AMSTERDAM was buffeted by worries elsewhere on the continent and overseas
and the AEX index lost 4.81 or 1 per cent to 415.94.
There were steep falls among the heavily capitalised issues, with Unilever,
for instance, losing Fl 2.00 to Fl 213.90.
Pakhoed, the transport group, which announced that it was to issue 2.6m new
shares, fell 70 cents to Fl 54.50.
MADRID fell 2 per cent in line with weaker bond markets which were pushed
lower by disappointment with the Bundesbank's smaller than expected repo
rate cut, the US data and sales by foreign investors.
The general index shed 6.78 or 2 per cent to 332.68 in nervous trading.
Telefonica tumbled Pta85 or 4.3 per cent to Pta1,890 in volume of 6m shares
after news that it was paying Dollars 2bn for Ental-Peru and CPT-Peru.
BRUSSELS saw losses in the bank and insurance sector despite an interest
rate cut by the central bank.
The Bel-20 index closed up 1.10 at 1,516.90 in turnover of BFr1.9bn.
Nonetheless, Arbed, the Luxembourg steel manufacturer, went against the
trend, rising BFr300 or 7.3 per cent to BFr4,400,
Among insurers Groupe AG lost BFr45 to BFr2,880.
COPENHAGEN's KFX index retreated 1.27 to 112.04 with banks affected by a
steep fall in Den Danske Bank, off DKr4 at DKr395.
In contrast Unidanmark, the country's second largest bank, bucked the trend,
climbing DKr3 to DKr258, helped by news that its new share issue of 6m A
shares had been oversubscribed.
STOCKHOLM's Affarsvarlden index lost 16.4 to 1,522.5.
ISTANBUL lost a further 2.67 per cent despite a wave of selective buying in
the session.
The composite index ended down 400.34 at 14,603.25, bringing the losses over
the week so far to 9.85 per cent.
The Turkish lira lost more than 6 per cent against the dollar, standing at
TL21,500 in the afternoon.
The most active shares were iron and steel group Eregli, down TL50 to
TL3,550 and glassware producer Turkish Sise Cam Fabrikalari, down TL175 to
TL1,775.

FT  02 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Economic hopes help
Nikkei close above 20,000 level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The stable yen and hopes of a bottoming out of the economy supported
investor confidence, and the Nikkei 225 average closed above the 20,000
level for the first time since February 8, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index gained 219.42, or 1.1 per cent, at 20,216.62 on active buying by
foreign investors. It opened at the day's low of 20,052.61 and peaked at
20,240.92 during the morning.
Investors were encouraged by better than expected industrial output figures
and labour statistics announced on Monday. However, the tankan, the Bank of
Japan's quarterly survey of business sentiment, announced yesterday had
little impact on stock prices since it showed that sentiment among
manufacturers was little changed from the previous report.
Large-lot profit-taking around the 20,000 level by institutional investors
in the afternoon prevented the Nikkei 225 from rising further, in spite of
active overseas buying. The recent decline in the bond market also prompted
a shift into the stock market by foreign fund managers.
Volume was 500m shares, against 467m. The Topix index of all first section
stocks advanced 13.77 to 1,645.48, while the Nikkei 300 added 2.02 at
304.25. Rises led falls by 780 to 269, with 140 issues unchanged. But in
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 1.93 to 1,365.73.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y3,000 to Y979,000 in spite of reports
that it will not request a previously expected rise in local call rates for
the next fiscal year, but instead plans to raise its core service rate,
which would have a smaller effect on profits.
A strong rise in housing starts figures for January released on Monday
supported housing shares. Misawa Homes climbed Y40 to Y1,150 and Daiwa House
Y40 to Y1,700.
Foreign investors bought steel issues. Nippon Steel, the most active issue
of the day, gained Y2 at Y354.
Stocks previously higher on the multimedia theme, encountered profit-taking.
NEC receded Y10 to Y1,040. Some banking issues were easier on corporate
selling.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 185.08 to 22,323.96 in volume of 160m shares,
the eighth consecutive advance.
Roundup
The region was mixed yesterday. Seoul was closed for a national holiday.
HONG KONG fell 2.5 per cent, undermined by a slide in banking stocks and
worries that prices fetched at a government land auction were too high. The
Hang Seng index shed 261.87 to 10,148.36.
Heavy profit-taking from the opening in Hang Seng Bank and its parent HSBC
Holdings pulled the index down, following the two groups' results on Monday.
HSBC dropped HKDollars 7 to HKDollars 107 and Hang Seng Bank HKDollars 8 to
HKDollars 61.50.
The market fall gathered momentum in late trade on news that a residential
development site in the tourist district of Kowloon had sold for HKDollars
2.26bn, far exceeding forecasts of HKDollars 1.5bn to HKDollars 1.7bn.
This prompted concern that Hong Kong's high property prices, which are
propping up the stock market, might lead developers to raise funds through
the equity market with rights offers, which could eventually depress share
prices.
Blue chip properties fell. SHK Properties slid HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars
57.50 and Cheung Kong 75 cents to HKDollars 43.75.
SINGAPORE was dragged down by the worries in Hong Kong and concern over the
outlook for higher US interest rates. The Straits Times Industrial index
shed 29.04, or 1.2 per cent, to 2,313.68.
MANILA dropped 3.7 per cent to its lowest point this year, closing below the
2,850 support level as investors sold heavily in anticipation of a further
decline. The composite index lost 105.96 at 2,755.65.
The decline was also attributed to a shift to fixed-income instruments by
most foreign investors, following an increase in US interest rates.
KUALA LUMPUR saw some bargain hunting which lifted shares off the day's lows
after news that the central bank would not introduce fresh measures to choke
off local currency speculation.
Recent speculation about new liquidity-mopping measures, including a rise in
the statutory reserve requirement of financial institutions, had been
affecting market sentiment. The composite index ended 12.22 down at
1,113.41.
TAIWAN gained on a technical rebound after four days of declines, but
sentiment remained cautious. The weighted index improved 37.80 to 5,452.44.
AUSTRALIA clawed back futures-led losses but brokers said sentiment remained
nervous. The All Ordinaries index finished 1.6 up at 2,181.7.
On the Sydney futures market the March Index finished down 12 at 2,174.0.
NEW ZEALAND put in another impressive performance as the NZSE-40 capital
index rose 25.80 to 2,270.20.
KARACHI broke the 2,500 barrier for the first time, the KSE-100 index moving
ahead 43.52 to 2,505.24.
After the close the central bank cut the discount rate to 15 per cent from
17 per cent and the maximum lending rate to 19 per cent from 22 per cent.
BOMBAY eased in low volume as investors digested the implications of
Monday's budget. The BSE index lost 136.05, or 3.1 per cent, at 4,150.15.

FT  02 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (South Africa): Johannesburg boosted as
Mandela meets Buthelezi
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Johannesburg was given a boost during afternoon trading by the apparently
congenial talks in Durban between Mr Nelson Mandela, the African National
Congress president, and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the Inkatha Freedom
Party leader.
Chief Buthelezi said the talks had been 'going well', in spite of an earlier
vow that his party's boycott of the April election was not on the agenda for
the meeting.
The market was provided with a further boost as the gold price traded above
Dollars 380 an ounce. The golds index rallied from an initial fall to end 9
off at 1,986, industrials added 5 at 5,614 and the overall index put on 34
at 4,880.
Golds had been depressed by the stronger commercial rand which was seen as
dampening export earnings of the mines.
Anglos proved the most buoyant issue in the wake of the rising political
hopes, appreciating R7 to R204.
Among the gold shares, Vaal Reefs lost R1.50 to R430.50 and Driefontein was
off 25 cents at R55.25.
De Beers, the diamond giant, advanced R2 to R105.00 ahead of the release of
the group's interim results, which are expected next week.
SA Breweries was unchanged at R82.50, while Remgro put on 25 cents at R31.25
and Sasol, the oil-from-coal producer, was up 50 cents at R22.50 in response
to its 17 per cent increase in net income for the six months ending
December.
In industrial shares, Barlow Rand was down 25 cents to R27.75. Iscor posted
a strong 10 per cent bounce to R2.70 in a resumption of its recent upward
trend and Gencor rose 35 cents to R8.90.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Markets Report: Dollar recovers ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign exchange markets were dominated yesterday by the gyrations of the
dollar, which recovered from early weakness on the back of some strong
economic data, writes Philip Gawith.
After slipping to a low of DM1.6945 in early European trade, the US currency
later rose sharply to touch a high of DM1.7135, before closing in London at
DM1.7090. In New York it finished at DM1.7095.
The catalyst for renewed dollar strength - a reversal of recent negative
sentiment - was the release of fourth-quarter GDP figures, and the February
purchasing managers' index (NAPM).
GDP was revised to an annualised 7.5 per cent from an earlier 5.9 per cent
estimate, while the price component of the NAPM surged to 67, its highest
since October 1990, from 59.8 in January.
These strong growth indicators renewed speculation that the US Federal
Reserve may again raise interest rates.
Elsewhere, attention was focused on developments in the UK and German money
markets. In Germany the repo rate came down by three basis points to 5.97
per cent, while tight conditions in the UK discount market saw overnight
rates rise to 20 per cent at one stage.
The dollar started European trading at a new low for the year against the
D-Mark, after comments from Fed governor Mr Lawrence Lindsey sugg-ested that
interest rates were unlikely to rise in the short term.
This compounded sentiment which was already bearish on account of the
absence of clear investor demand for dollars and concern about the
currency's failure to advance recently in spite of a run of favourable data
and events. There was also concern that hedge funds, rumoured to be
cash-short, were selling dollars.
These selling pressures gained further impetus when the Bundesbank announced
that the repo rate was fall-ing by only three basis points. The small
increment of the fall was seen as lending support to the German currency.
The lunchtime release of the GDP and NAPM figures reversed the trend. The
detail was seen as offering a strong indication that the next move in Fed
rates would be up.
As Mr Nick Parsons, chief economist at CIBC, commented: 'The two components
that were strong in January (commodity prices and employment), and preceded
a Fed tightening, were strong in February.'
Many observers played down the stronger dollar, saying it was more a
correction within a range than a change in sen-timent. Mr Brian Hilliard,
senior international economist at SGST, said: 'This is not the making of a
lasting dollar rally.' He added that market reaction to the NAPM was
overdone as the price index did not offer any new infor-mation.
Clearly the market remains extremely nervous about inflation pressures in
the US. Yesterday it chose to focus on the narrowly based price index of the
NAPM, while ignoring the fact that the GDP deflator, the broadest available
inflation indicator, was unchanged.
The dollar was slightly firmer against the yen, closing at Y104.615 from
Y104.150 on Monday. It ended New York trading at Y104.55. The Bank of
Japan's tankan report confirmed the weak state of the economy, but was no
worse than expected.
The D-Mark was firmer in Europe, with the small cut in the repo rate seen as
indicating that the Bundesbank is likely to be cautious in relaxing policy.
The German currency ended in London at L989.8 against the Italian lira, up
from Monday's L988.2, and at FFr3.403 from FFr3.399.
This cautious approach was not well received in the futures market. The
price of the December three-month interest rate future on the Liffe fell by
14 basis points.
Traders said the D-Mark also gained support from weakness in the Italian
bond market which spread to other European markets. Sellers of bonds,
wanting to put their money in cash, were reported to have bought D-Marks, as
German interest rates are quite fav-ourable.
In Europe the Belgian national bank cut its key central rate to 6.25 per
cent from 6.40 per cent. Belgium last reduced rates on Friday.
Yesterday was an exceptional day in UK money markets. After forecasting a
shortage of Pounds 1.7bn, the Bank of England provided no assistance in its
early round, and only Pounds 22m at midday. This saw the overnight rate rise
to 20 per cent at 2 pm. Only Pounds 338m assistance was provided during the
afternoon round, with the bulk of funds - Pounds 995m - being offered
through late assistance.
The pattern of the day's events suggested that most of the bills had been
held by the large clearing banks. 'The distribution of shortage around the
market did not coincide with distribution of bills to relieve it,' said one
observer.
By not offering bills in the early rounds, those who held the bills were
able to drive up the cost of borrowing for those with a shortage of funds.
Sterling finished a shade up at DM2.5395 from DM2.5366 and was barely
changed against the dollar at Dollars 1.486.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sri Lankan planters thirsty for
privatisation - Conflicting interests in the world's leading tea industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MERVYN DE SILVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sri Lanka's tea and rubber industries, two major export sectors, have done
remarkably well in the first year of partial privatisation and President DB
Wijetunge is keen to move on to the next stage. But there are political
obstacles.
Tea production rose to 117m kg in the first six months of 1993 and the
estimate for the full year is 230m kg. The first half figure represents a 37
per cent rise over 1992, when a severe drought, the worst in 30 years, cut
production to 179m kg. Rubber production in the first six months was 62m kg,
up 30 per cent on the same period in 1992. Coconut production did less well,
dropping by 14 per cent.
The first phase of privatisation began in July 1992 when 22 management
companies signed profit-sharing contracts with the government, which
retained ownership of the plantations nationalised by the centre left
coalition of prime minister Mrs Bandaranaike in 1972.
Politics decided the issue then - Mrs Bandaranaike's minister of plantation
industries was a Marxist - and it was the decisive factor in President
Premadasa's compromise in 1992.
Mr Premadasa's dilemma was understood by the IMF and the World Bank, which
had been pressing the government to dismantle the two state corporations
that owned the plantations. The estates employ well over 500,000 workers, of
which 80 per cent are members of the Ceylon Workers' Congress, which is also
a political party with five members in parliament. The CWC president, Mr S.
Thondaman, the most successful trade union boss in the island's history, has
been a cabinet minister since Mr JR Jayawardene led the conservative UNP to
a sweeping victory in the 1977 election.
This UNP/CWC alliance not only guaranteed a block vote but trade union
'peace' on the strategic plantations. If anything, President Premadasa, Mr
Jayawardene's successor, was even friendlier, and Mr Thondaman stood by him
in every crisis.
Mr Jayawardene and Mr Premadasa, Colombo-based 'low-country' politicians,
saw Mr Thondaman as an important ally in view of the danger that that the
separatist Tamil 'tigers' of the north might infiltrate the tea estates and
open a new front. But Mr Wijetunge, Mr Premadasa's successor, has been
determined to limit the union boss's influence. The new president is a hill
country 'Kandyan' (Kandy is the central province capital) and the Kandyans
have no reason to like the tea pluckers. The British evicted them from their
traditional homelands to plant tea and settle cheap indentured Indian Tamil
labour.
If he is to press forward with privatisation, however, Mr Wijetunge will
have to balance commercial advantage against electoral cost. Moving this
highly regulated industry into private ownership will entail a loss of
economic protection for Mr Thondaman's members and of many of their votes
for the president. But planters are impatient for measures to reduce their
cost disadvantage in the export market.
The basic daily wage for tea pluckers was raised from SLRs60 to SLRs70 last
June and then to SLRs82, about USDollars 1.70, in July. Wages amount to 60
to 70 per cent of the cost of tea production in Sri Lanka, compared with
only about 40 per cent in India, Kenya and Indonesia. More recently
devaluation of the Indian rupee has given Sri Lanka's main rival a further
advantage.
The critical factors are cost of production and net sale average. India and
Kenya help producers to limit production costs and Indonesia has assisted
planters by reducing interest rates. And in all three countries lower wages
are paid.
'Mr Thondaman, who is a cabinet minister, has got us by the throat,' says a
Sri Lankan planters' association official.
Spelling out Sri Lanka's strategy, plantations industries minister Mr Rupa
Karunatilleke stresses privatisation, removal of excessive export duties and
exchange liberalisation. 'Aggressive marketing should emphasise health now
that there is increasing consumer preference for natural products,' he
argues.
But the main problem, he admits, is that Sri Lanka's production is almost 90
per cent orthodox tea, when 50 per cent of world demand is for the CTC (cut,
tear and curl) type. Sri Lanka has now decided to convert 20 per cent of its
tea production to CTC over the next three years, and 25 CTC products are in
the pipeline. The cost of conversion will be about USDollars 18m. 'All
matters are open to negotiation,' Mr Thondaman says.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU reforms lift farmers'
incomes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reform of the common agricultural policy boosted farm incomes last year, the
European Commission said yesterday.
The commission published initial estimates based on accounts from 58,000
farms across the European Union which showed an overall decline in income of
1.2 per cent last year. But sectors subjected to the 1992 MacSharry reforms
moved strongly against the trend.
According to the Eurostat figures, incomes in the beef and cattle sector
rose by as much as 25 per cent last year compared with 1992, while
specialised cereal farmers enjoyed an 11 per cent increase and dairy farmers
saw a 7 per cent rise.
Mr Rene Steichen, EU farm commissioner, said the commission's analysis of
the figures 'clearly indicates that the production sectors subject to reform
experienced a significant income increase in 1993'.
This runs counter to popular belief among farmers that the reforms, which
cut price supports to reduce production and introduced direct income
payments or livestock payments in compensation, would be financially
painful.
Mr Steichen accepted that the reforms were not the only reason why incomes
had risen but added: 'The figures nonetheless confirm the positive benefits
for farmers of improving market balance, as well as the income stabilisation
effect of direct payments'.
The agricultural sectors that suffered most last year receive only light
support from the CAP or have not yet been reformed. Pig and poultry farmers
took a 37 per cent knock to their incomes while horticulturalists were down
8 per cent and wine-makers suffered a 14 per cent decline.
Incomes varied enormously between member states, according to the Eurostat
figures, with a rise of over 15 per cent in the UK contrasting with a fall
of nearly 15 per cent in Germany and 11.7 per cent in the Netherlands. The
UK benefited from currency devaluation, which pushed up the value of
Ecu-based payments, and is heavily dependent on sectors that underwent
reform. Germany and the Netherlands produce a lot of pigmeat, wine and
vegetables between them, the sectors that suffered last year.
The commission qualified the overall income drop of 1.2 per cent, pointing
out that farmers received only 86 per cent of the direct payments due to
them during 1993.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK set to take lead in North
Sea oil stakes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI and ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain could overtake Norway this year as western Europe's biggest producer
of oil and natural gas liquids and might be able to maintain a forecast peak
output of 2.5m barrels a day until 1998, according to Wood Mackenzie, the
Edinburgh-based energy consultancy.
Norway's contribution to North Sea output would fall to 49 per cent from 53
per cent in 1993 while UK production was expected to rise by 30 per cent
this year.
The decline in Norway's share would occur despite an expected 9 per cent
increase in output to a record 2.59m barrels a day, WoodMac said.
It estimated that 327 field production days would be lost in Norway this
year, up from 160 in 1993, because of scheduled maintenance. That included
the shutdown of the Ekofisk centre, the hub for oil and gas fields that feed
into the Norpipe transportation system.
'Scheduled maintenance is expected to result in the deferment of over 23m
barrels of production in 1994 compared with 16m barrels in 1993,' the
consultancy said. Unscheduled stoppages in 1993 accounted for 14 per cent of
total lost production days, it added, resulting in the deferment of more
than 2m barrels of oil and natural gas liquids.
Four new Norwegian fields were expected to be brought on stream this year,
contributing some 80,000 b/d a day. But the new supply would be staggered
throughout the year and therefore would not have a significant impact on
Norway's production profile.
On the UK side of the North Sea WoodMac believed that the present build-up
of production to a forecast average of 2.5m b/d this year might be
maintained to 1998. The figure is the highest since 1987 and, if achieved,
would represent a second peak in UK North Sea production.
The forecasts coincided with the publication yesterday of official figures
confirming the surge in UK petroleum production. In the three months to the
end of January oil output was 30m tonnes, a 21.4 per cent rise from a year
earlier, according to the Department of Trade and Industry. Natural gas
output rose by 15.4 per cent.
The optimistic outlook of the WoodMac study was based on the likelihood that
a record number of new fields - 62 - would receive development approval in
the next three years or so. Those included some with large potential
reserves, such as the Foinaven and Schiehallion fields, which British
Petroleum and its partners have found in deep water west of the Shetland
Islands.
The fields likely to be developed contain at least 3.5bn barrels of oil and
13 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, equivalent to about 30 per cent of
the UK's remaining commercial reserves.
Their importance in sustaining higher levels of UK output is such that by
2000 they could account for 40 per cent of total oil production.
The WoodMac analysts conceded that the persistence of prices for the
benchmark Brent Blend of under Dollars 15 a barrel would erode the
confidence of companies. But their research suggested that a relatively high
level of development activity would continue on the UK continental shelf.
The study estimated that investment of Pounds 15bn in real terms would be
needed to develop the fields. Peak annual expenditure of Pounds 3bn would be
in 1996, when it would account for 70 per cent of the industry's expected
capital spending.
Ms Kate Jackson, a WoodMac analyst, said the fields under study showed a
bias towards oil, whereas gas figured more prominently in previous years.
The potential gas production of the fields of 3,000m cubic feet a day by
2000 was unlikely to be required, she said, even though independent gas
marketing companies were lining up sources of supply to compete with British
Gas when the domestic market was opened up to competition beginning in 1996.
The development timetables of some of the mainly gas fields could slip, she
said, until gas demand increased in the early years of the next decade.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Electricity costs may hit Elkem
smelters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Elkem, the Norwegian light metals producer, said yesterday that temporary
lay-offs were possible at some of its smelters because domestic spot market
prices for electricity had more than doubled to NKr0.48 a kW/hour in the
past two days.
An official said the company had been considering increasing output at
ferro-chrome and ferro-silicon smelters. But it was now reviewing the plan
and might have to reduce capacity even for aluminium.
Elkem consumes about 8.5bn MW/hours of electricity annually for light-metals
production but on an annual basis it buys just 10 per cent of its
electricity needs in the spot market. The remainder is supplied under
long-term, fixed-rate contracts and from its own generating plants.
Norway's electricity market has been undergoing reform during the past
couple of years and is considered one of Europe's most liberal. Because of
this the government has refused to intervene to stem rising prices.
Energy analysts say prices have risen because of the unusually cold weather
and speculation that electricity suppliers have not secured large enough
trading agreements with neighbouring Sweden and Denmark to cover a shortfall
in domestic production.
The government said that it would allow the ceilings for imports of
electricity to be lifted so that suppliers could cover any shortfall in
domestic production. It has also consulted Swedish and Danish authorities on
the issue.
Average prices for electricity so far this year have been NKr0.18 a KWh,
according to government figures, but have shot up in the past two days to
around NKr0.48 during the day and NKr0.35.5 in the evening.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries drop on fresh inflation
fears
</HEADLINE>

US Treasury prices plunged at the long end of the maturity range as
investors reacted negatively to news of an increase in the purchasing
managers' monthly price index.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 1 15/32 at
93 9/32 , yielding 6.774 per cent. The two-year note was also lower, down
5/16 at 99 19/32 , yielding 4.824 per cent.
Traders blamed the selling on the National Association of Purchasing
Management's February report. Although the NAPM's index of nationwide
manufacturing activity fell from 57.7 in January to 56.6 last month -
normally good news for bonds - this was mostly explained by analysts as the
result of the severe winter weather that struck large parts of the US in
February.
Instead, investors focused on the sharp jump in the association's price
index, which climbed from 59.8 to 67.0. This, plus a big increase in the
NAPM's employment index, spooked the market, which is extremely sensitive to
signs of inflation, particularly wage inflation. The result was heavy
selling of bonds.
The day's other news was an upward revision in the government's estimate of
the growth in fourth-quarter gross domestic product of 5.9 per cent to 7.5
per cent. This was clearly bearish for bonds but traders said it ultimately
had little impact because it had already been priced into the market.
Later in the day, comments from Mr Robert Parry, president of the San
Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, further unsettled sentiment. He said the
Fed's recent 25 basis point reduction in short-term interest rates would
probably not be enough to ensure that it achieves its long-term goal of
keeping inflation low.
European government bonds fell sharply on the back of weak US Treasuries and
a smaller than expected monetary easing in the Bundesbank's latest open
market operation.
At the Bundesbank's allocation of two-week securities repurchase agreements,
the minimum repo rate fell by three basis points to 5.97 per cent. That was
less than the five to 10-basis point fall most traders had been calling for
and was seen to indicate that the Bundesbank's pace of easing remains
extremely cautious.
In the afternoon, selling was fuelled by the sharp drop in US Treasuries
triggered by the NAPM report. 'This confirms my medium-term scenario that
Europe can't decouple from the US,' said Kirit Shah, international
strategist at First Chicago.
New supply in several European markets put a further damper on prices. 'With
no buyers around, how are governments going to finance their deficits?'
questioned one trader.
Europe's high-yielding bond markets were especially hard-hit by yesterday's
sell-off. The Italian long bond future on Liffe fell by 2.10 points to 111.
Following the dismal reception of Monday's three and five-year auctions, the
prospect of L7,500 of new 10 and 30-year bonds triggered a sharp sell-off in
the morning. In the event, the result of the long-dated auctions was better
than feared, but traders said the paper would continue to weigh on the
market.
Spanish bonds did even worse, pounded by heavy foreign selling, the long
bond future in Madrid falling by 2.20 points to 99.59.
French bonds also slid by more than a point on the back of the German repo
and US Treasuries weakness. The March notional bond future's breach of
technical support at 126.36 opened the floodgates for further selling,
mostly by foreign accounts, traders said. It fell by 1.22 points on the day
to close at 125.74, but slipped further to 125.10 in after-hours trading.
UK gilts fell by two points at the long end, under-performing core European
markets. After falling in line with other bond markets, talk of large
overseas selling knocked prices even lower. The March long gilt future fell
by 2 1/8 points to close at 111 3/8 .
'After outperforming on the upside over the last few days and getting lulled
into a false sense of security, gilts outperformed on the downside
yesterday,' said Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities.
'The market fell two points on absolutely no news or fresh supply - that has
to be a cause for concern,' he added.
German bonds also weakened on disappointment over the repo and the slide in
US Treasuries, and were further pressured by the sale of DM3bn of new
10-year bonds for the Treuhandanstalt. Another tranche of the issue is due
to be auctioned today. In after-hours London trading, the March bund future
was down 1.06 points from Monday's close at 95.86.

FT  02 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: World government bonds suffer
heavy losses in February
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
World government bond markets suffered heavy losses last month, sparked by
the combination of US inflation worries, concern about the slow pace of
monetary easing in Europe, and heavy selling of European bond futures by US
hedge funds.
The UK was the worst performing government bond market, with a loss of 3.47
per cent in February in local currency terms, according to figures compiled
by JP Morgan Securities.
Spain was the next worst performing market, with a loss of 2.79 per cent,
followed by Canada with a decline of 2.68 per cent.
Japan was the top performing government bond market, but still showed a loss
of 0.71 per cent in local currency terms. However, in US dollar terms,
Japanese government bonds showed gains of 3.92 per cent, helped by the
strengthening of the yen against the US currency last month, and putting the
JGB market well ahead of the other main government bond markets.
The event which triggered the fall in government bond prices was the
decision by the US Federal Reserve on February 4 to raise short-term
interest rates to curb inflationary pressures.
However, the move had the effect of heightening concern in the markets about
the prospect of rising US inflation and further tightening by the Fed.
Despite small cuts in interest rates across Europe last month - including a
25 basis point cut in the UK base rate, a 50 basis point cut in Germany's
discount rate, and a 10 basis point reduction in the French intervention
rate - many investors were disappointed at the slow pace of easing.
Heavy selling of European government bonds, particularly of the futures
contracts, by US hedge funds during the last two weeks of February pushed
the European markets down strongly.
France's economy minister, Mr Edmond Alphandery, is to loosen drastically
issuing procedures in the French domestic bond market to bring them into
line with those in the Eurofranc market, Reuter reports from Paris. He said
that issuers would, however, still be able to book a time spot for issuance
if they wanted to have priority. He gave no further details.
Mr Alphandery also said issuers and intermediaries would do away with a
one-day delay between payment and making funds available and reduce the
costs of financial services for new issues.

FT  02 MAR 94 / International Bonds: Lacklustre demand for African
Development Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The African Development Bank took advantage of calmer market conditions at
the start of this week to launch its Dollars 500m 10-year Eurobond, via
Lehman Brothers and Salomon Brothers. But despite being reasonably priced,
the deal met lacklustre demand, according to syndicate officials.
'Investors were relieved that the last 24 hours had been better, but they
are not in buying mode,' said one syndicate manager.
The African Development Bank deal suffered as inflationary fears prompted by
the latest spate of US economic data prompted a further sell-off in US
Treasuries.
The deal was priced to yield 28 basis points above the 10-year US Treasury.
For investors, this represents a yield pick-up of about 8 basis points over
the Asian Development Bank's recent 10-year deal, currently trading at 20
basis points over the Treasury.
Dealers described the pricing as offering fair value, but said that they had
seen little buying interest. The spread widened slightly to 29 basis points.
The deal was issued under the bank's Dollars 500m Euro medium-term note
programme, which is now likely to be increased, according to its treasurer,
Mr Kofi Bucknor. The bank expects to borrow a further Dollars 500m this
year.
The proceeds were swapped into floating-rate dollars. Dollar swap spreads
have widened slightly as the bond market has sold off, creating some better
arbitrage opportunities.
The market saw heavy new issuance in the equity-linked sector by Japanese
borrowers, with Dollars 1.1bn in US dollar-denominated issues and SFr270m of
Swiss franc-denominated issues.
In the face of such heavy supply, investor demand for the issues appeared
fairly weak, although syndicate officials said they expected to sell the
issues over the next few days. Buying was mainly from Europe, although some
demand was reported from the Middle and Far East.
Investors were a mixture of arbitrageurs - who were buying the warrants and
shorting the stock - and traditional equity-linked investors who want
exposure to the stock.
Dealers said the heavy supply was purely coincidental rather than a
reflection of suitable market conditions.
Tobu Railway launched the biggest equity-linked deal of the day, a Dollars
400m four-year bond issue with warrants.
One dealer said several Japanese borrowers were expected to launch
equity-linked deals ahead of the introduction of new accounting rules in
April.

FT  02 MAR 94 / International Company News: Blockbuster shareholders' Viacom
move rejected
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A Delaware court yesterday rejected a move to block a Dollars 1.25bn
investment by Blockbuster Entertainment, the US home video company, in cable
television group Viacom.
The application had been brought by some shareholders in Blockbuster, which
had agreed to pay Dollars 55 a share for a stake in Viacom to provide cash
for the cable TV company's winning bid for Paramount Communications.
Viacom's non-voting 'B' shares were trading yesterday at Dollars 29.
The Delaware chancery court said blocking the investment would case
'enormous uncertainty with widespread repercussions, causing Paramount
Communications stockholders to reconsider their decision to tender their
shares under Viacom's tender offer'.
Blockbuster shareholders have yet to vote on whether to accept an all-share
offer for the company from Viacom. Although it has already received the
backing of Blockbuster's board, the deal has come under fire from some
shareholders given the sharp fall in Viacom's share price.

<TEXT>
Union Pacific, the US railroad and resources group, has agreed to pay
Dollars 819m for the oil and gas interests of Cypress Amax, the mining
company formed by a merger late last year.
Union said it had already reached agreement to sell some assets for Dollars
94.5m, retaining mainly gas producing, gathering and processing assets in
Texas and Louisiana.
The disposal signals Cypress Amax's intention to concentrate on its mining
activities. It brings Union Pacific proven gas reserves to 550bn cubic feet,
adding approximately 20 per cent to its existing reserves.
In addition, the assets purchased include 550 miles of gathering lines and
three gas processing plants. Union Pacific said that the properties it was
acquiring were underdeveloped, and that it planned to begin drilling by the
middle of this year to add to the proven reserves in the field.
Union said the proven reserves accounted for Dollars 424m of the purchase
price, with the pipelines and other assets making up the rest.

Bundaberg Sugar, the Australian sugar producer owned by Tate &amp; Lyle of the
UK, yesterday raised its ADollars 87m (USDollars 62m) bid for two crushing
mills in northern Queensland.
Bundaberg, acquired by Tate &amp; Lyle for ADollars 325m three years ago, said
it was increasing its offer for the 30,000 shares in the Tully Sugar mill
from ADollars 1,600 a share to ADollars 2,160 a share. Its offer for the
3.9m shares in South Johnstone goes up from ADollars 9.40 to ADollars 12.25,
increasing the total value of the bids by around ADollars 26m, to
approximately ADollars 113m.
Mr Geoff Mitchell, managing director of Bundaberg, said that the increased
offer was an effort to address issues raised by shareholders, including
'current profitability, retained earnings, grower control and prospects'.
Bundaberg, which announced its original offers in October, said that 'the
proposal to invest in the north Queensland sugar industry now represents a
total commitment of some ADollars 125m'.
The mills said that the offers would be referred to their financial
advisers.

Arnotts, the Australian biscuits, snacks and confectionery company now
majority-owned by Campbell Soup of the US, yesterday reported a 16.6 per
cent increase in after-tax profits before abnormal items, in the six months
to the end of December, to ADollars 44.2m (USDollars 31.5m), and said it was
confident of meeting its full-year forecast of ADollars 80.9m.
There were no abnormal charges in the latest half-year, but the first half
of 1992-93 included a ADollars 15.8m surplus, taking the group's net
operating profits for that period to ADollars 53.8m after abnormals.
Yesterday, Mr Paul Bourke, Arnotts managing director, admitted that
underlying sales advances had been extremely difficult to achieve during the
six months. Arnotts' total sales fell from ADollars 344.8m to ADollars
332.8m, although Mr Bourke said that if asset disposals were excluded, there
was a small 1.3 per cent increase. The underlying increase in volumes was
just 0.9 per cent.
Overall, sales for the core Australian biscuit division were similar to the
corresponding period a year ago, but Arnotts said that the contribution for
the newly-launched snack products range had been 'lower than anticipated'.
Mr Bourke also conceded that lower media spending had helped the profits
increase.
He said Arnotts' planned move in Asian markets was progressing, with
discussions under way which could lead to biscuits being manufactured in
southern China within a year to 18 months.

<TEXT>
Star TV, the Asian broadcasting giant 63.6 per cent owned by Mr Rupert
Murdoch's News Corporation, has averted a legal dispute with Wharf Cable,
the fledgling Hong Kong network, by announcing it will not enforce a
nine-month old agreement to supply programming to the cable operator.
The move ends months of wrangling, which culminated in January when Wharf
took court action to scrap its licensing agreement, under which it is
required to screen four premium channels and three existing Star channels -
MTV, the BBC World Service and Prime Sport.
Wharf started proceedings against Star after seven months spent 'attempting
to conclude an agreement with successive Star TV managements'.
Mr Gary Davey, the third chief executive of Star TV in six months, said:
'Star TV has reluctantly come to the conclusion that a workable relationship
with Wharf Cable is simply not possible under the present agreement.
'We are hopeful that by taking this action the whole issue will be looked at
in a less contentious manner and help us move forward in finding a way to
make these services available to Hong Kong viewers.'
Wharf Cable said it was sorry to see Star's plans to launch new regional pay
TV services will be further delayed and noted that in order to continue to
expand viewers' choice it would endeavour to source quality channels from a
wide range of other regional providers as well.
Shell Electric Manufacturing, a Hong Kong electric-appliance maker, reported
net profits of HKDollars 139.6m (USDollars 18.1m) for the year to October 31
1993, up 73 per cent on the previous year.
Revenues totalled HKDollars 1.3bn, against HKDollars 1.2bn, and second-half
dividend is raised to 11.5 cents from 8 cents.

co-operation

<TEXT>
NEC of Japan and Samsung Electronics of South Korea, two of the world's
largest memory chip manufacturers, plan a joint development of
next-generation memory chips, expanding their existing co-operation
agreements, NEC said yesterday.
The two companies are aiming for an agreement by the middle of this month on
a development of 256-megabit dynamic random access memory (D-Ram) chips
which could cost up to Y100bn (Dollars 960m).
Japanese semiconductor makers, who have superior manufacturing technology,
have previously teamed up with US chip manufacturers, but are now
increasingly turning to South Korea as technology there advances.
Japan's leading semiconductor makers have this year begun mass producing
16-megabit D-Ram chips, and are planning to start sample shipments of
64-megabit D-Ram chips. Analysts believe that samples of the 256-megabit
chips are likely to be available in 1997 or 1998.
But the more advanced the semiconductor, the more expensive it is to
develop, the NEC spokesman said. He said the cost of developing the
256-megabit D-Ram chip is seen 'in the tens of billions of yen'.
The NEC spokesman said the accord with Samsung would spread the risk, and
allow mutual supply by unifying production specifications.
NEC and Samsung have already agreed to exchange information on the
256-megabit D-Ram cell structure and Samsung has asked for NEC's help in
developing the logic integrated circuit, which relies heavily on process
technology.
Samsung is South Korea's largest semiconductor maker and, based on sales,
ranked seventh in the world last year, for the first time breaking into the
top 10.
NEC, the world's second-largest chip maker behind Intel of the US, holds
more than 50 per cent of Japan's personal computer market.

FT  02 MAR 94 / International Company News: World waits for the second
Chinese wave - A look at the batch of companies set for overseas listings
this summer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The second batch of China state-run companies slated for overseas listings
is likely to hit Hong Kong - or, in some cases, New York - around July,
roughly a year after Tsingtao Brewery, producer of the only internationally
recognised Chinese beer, made its trail-blazing debut.
On that occasion the mood was euphoric: the stock rose 29 per cent on its
offer price, and up to 100 regulatory and industry dignitaries trooped into
the Hong Kong stock exchange gallery for toasts of Tsingtao. But there were
also plenty of teething problems, exacerbated by debates over the preferred
route the global offering should follow to ensure optimum pricing and
whether primary listings should be sought beyond the colony.
Things are expected to be altogether different this summer. While analysts
reckon there is still sufficient long-term interest in China to outweigh the
current raft of uncertainties over the way in which tax and currency reforms
will affect companies, the fact remains that increased supply will mop up
some of the froth.
Looking at the 22 state companies approved for overseas listings,
professionals report a far greater will and ability to streamline and adapt
operations in order to woo the international investors. The resistance
encountered last year is, they say, already history.
Mr Meocre Li, managing partner of Arthur Andersen Hong Kong and China, cites
the example of one of the early companies which his firm visited. The
company insisted it did not want to undergo any restructuring: it wanted the
world to see what a socialist-style company looked like. Ultimately, it had
to forgo its ideals, but not before other accountants had passed through its
doors and delivered the same verdict.
So far down the road have China bosses come - only recently, releasing
commercial information to foreigners would have landed company directors in
jail - that at least four of the 22 are aiming for Wall Street, where
disclosure requirements are far greater than in Hong Kong.
These include Shandong Huaneng Electricity Joint Stock Power Company and
Huaneng International Joint Stock Company, both power supply companies, and
perhaps China Southern Airlines and China Eastern Airways.
The attraction of New York over Hong Kong is broadly threefold:
price/earnings ratios are greater and so companies can raise more cash;
there are fewer China companies available; and - not at all least important
in Chinese eyes - New York is perceived as carrying higher prestige.
Some China companies already listed in New York are trading on an average
p/e of around 30 times whereas the first batch of H shares (Chinese company
shares listed in Hong Kong) came on line in the colony with p/e ratios of
around 10 to 15.
Some analysts believe one or two companies may achieve a listing in London
especially as the stock exchange there has been lobbying in China.
Mr Charles Lee, chairman of the Hong Kong stock exchange is undaunted by the
competition - pointing out that this is after all what the free port of Hong
Kong thrives on - and says the Beijing State Council's decision to test the
waters in New York is very much by way of a small pilot run.
Feedback from New York and Tokyo, he says, shows that institutional
investors tend to prefer shares having their primary listing in Hong Kong,
because Hong Kong can better understand - and more realistically price - the
issues.
He illustrates this with the case of Shanghai Petrochemical, one of last
year's biggest H share issuers. Only about 30 per cent was offered in the
colony with the remainder going abroad - mainly to the US. Yet trading over
the past couple of weeks has shown that volumes in Hong Kong are four times
those in New York.
It is inevitable that the bulk of the second batch of companies will wind up
in Hong Kong: the colony's stock exchange last year signed a special
Memorandum of Understanding with its counterpart in Beijing which smooths
the way for mainland enterprises to list, by promoting co-operation between
the two parties.
H shares per se may no longer be a novelty, but the second line-up offers
investors their first bite at some of the hottest China sectors - -
infrastructure and aviation, key beneficiaries of a developing middle class
and government commitments to breathe life into poor power and transport
facilities.
Ms Dora Hung, analyst with Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong, says: 'People expect
short-term volatilities following changes in China's policy and the tax
structure. No-one yet knows how the government will implement some of these
changes. It takes time for things to run smoothly with new regulations
coming into force, but for people investing in China they know they must
look long term.'

Beyond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
It sounded more like a fringe meeting at a New Age rave than a product
launch. Against a background of weird, throbbing music, the man at the
podium talked of yin and yang, body and soul, life, the universe, and
everything.
However, to nobody's great surprise, it quickly emerged that Coca-Cola had
not decided to give up the business of money-making for a life of
philanthropy and consciousness-raising.
Rather, it was signalling plans to grab a slice of the market for so-called
New Age beverages, the fastest-growing sector of the US soft-drinks market.
Coca-Cola's weapon in the New Age drinks war is a product called Fruitopia,
a vaguely psychedelic-looking range of bottled drinks that turns out to
consist of nothing but water, sugar, fruit juice and natural colouring.
However, if the contents of the bottles are prosaic, the labels are not.
They carry pictures dotted with the words 'mind', 'body' and 'spirit', and
the drinks have names like Raspberry Psychic Lemonade, Strawberry Passion
Awareness, Total Fruit Integration and Citrus Consciousness.
The bottles also carry mind-expanding epigrams. On the bottle of Grape
Beyond, for example, the slogan says: 'Things that are still right in the
cosmos: the perfection of a circle, Beethoven's 9th, Grape Beyond.'
The launch of its Fruitopia is seen as a clear attempt by Coca-Cola to
replicate the phenomenal success of a range of similar fruit drinks made by
the New York-based Snapple Beverages, a stock-market flyer since it went
public a year ago.
By coincidence, Snapple yesterday reported net profits soaring to Dollars
67.6m in the year to December, from a pro-forma Dollars 18.3m last time. Its
shares, however, sank Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 27 1/8 as news of the
Fruitopia launch emerged.
The total market for New Age beverages - loosely defined as 'natural' drinks
like iced teas, fruit juices, bottled water and sports drinks - is estimated
to be worth Dollars 6bn, and Coca-Cola has only 8 per cent of it. The
company expects the Fruitopia launch to take that share to 15 per cent
initially, and to 30 per cent within three years.
Mr Sergio Zyman, Coca-Cola's senior vice-president and chief marketing
officer, said the product would be available in US stores in four weeks, and
in three or four other countries soon after. Its launch would be backed by a
Dollars 30m marketing campaign.
Snapple seemed unconcerned by the move. All that extra advertising would
simply accelerate the market's growth, it said. And, asked why so many
people were suddenly buying New Age beverages, it suggested: 'Maybe they're
sick of Coke.'

Electrolux, the Swedish household appliances group, has decided to sell up

also apply for Autoliv's listing on the Stockholm stock exchange before the
end of June, AP-DJ reports from Stockholm.
Autoliv is the largest European manufacturer of safety belts, airbags and
other personal safety equipment for vehicles. In 1993, the company reported
a pre-tax profit of SKr300m (Dollars 37.5m) on sales of SKr5.3bn.
Electrolux has decided to sell Autoliv as part of its strategy to
concentrate on core operations. The group said it also wanted to strengthen
its financial position to allow further acquisitions within its four core
areas: household appliances, commercial appliances, outdoor products and
industrial products.

FT  02 MAR 94 / International Company News: Deficit deepens at Nissan
Spanish unit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Expectations of sharply deteriorating results at Nissan Motor Iberica, the
Spanish subsidiary of the Japanese Nissan car group, were confirmed
yesterday with the announcement of a Pta40.95bn (Dollars 293m) pre-tax loss
for 1993. This was almost three times its deficit of Pta14.37bn the previous
year.
The figures were in line with forecasts.
They reflected a rise in net operating losses, to Pta23.21bn from Pta8.26bn,
and higher financial costs of Pta21.17bn compared with Pta11.10bn.
However the year showed an increase in sales by the company, which makes
commercial and four-wheel drive vehicles, to Pta182bn from Pta163bn. Unit
sales rose by about 3,500 to just over 100,000.
Last November, Nissan increased its stake in the company from 70 per cent to
96 per cent at a cost of about Pta8.5bn. It also announced a three-year
restructuring plan, including the laying off of 1,000 of its 7,000
employees.
Nissan's difficulties in Spain, where it has five plants, have coincided
with problems at Volkswagen's Seat subsidiary and Suzuki's offshoot, Santana
Motor, which filed for receivership earlier last month and is seeking
government support.

<TEXT>
Ipsco, western Canada's only basic steelmaker, ran at full capacity last
year with shipments peaking at 1m tonnes, up 24 per cent from 1992.
Demand was strong for sheet, oil and gas well tubing and fabricated
products, but large diameter pipe business was weaker.
Fourth-quarter net profit was CDollars 9m (USDollars 6m), or 39 cents a
share, up from CDollars 6.1m, or 38 cents, on fewer shares outstanding a
year earlier. Revenues were CDollars 168m, against CDollars 140.5m.
For the year earnings were CDollars 28.7m, or CDollars 1.42, compared with
CDollars 15.5m, or 98 cents.

stake deal

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
North American media companies are negotiating for a 49 per cent stake in
Vox, a private German television station owned by a consortium headed by the
Bertelsmann group.
According to unconfirmed reports, the bidders are Time Warner of the US and
CanWest Global Systems of Canada. Vox is one of nine German-based private
broadcasters competing for viewers with 15 publicly-owned channels.
Their move is understood to have been initiated last month when the
publisher of the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, decided to dispose of its 20
per cent stake in the struggling broadcaster.
Bertelsmann, Europe's biggest media business with widespread international
interests in print and electronic media, holds a 24.9 per cent stake. Other
shareholders include the WMB holding company, of which 47 per cent is in the
hands of the public sector bank, WestLB.
Bertelsmann yesterday would confirm only that it was in talks which should
lead to 'stabilisation' of the shareholdings in Vox, which had a shaky
launch into the crowded German TV market just over a year ago.
The company said a group of American investors was seeking a 49 per cent
stake, but that the current owners were not offering that amount. It said
that although Bertelsmann had no plans to reduce its stake, an announcement
could be made in the next few weeks.
Originally conceived as an information channel, much of Vox's output is now
entertainment. The Suddeutsche Zeitung, which supplies a magazine programme,
S-Zett, and other services to Vox, is believed to want to pull out because
of the format change, and the unexpectedly high start-up losses, exacerbated
by recession.

FT  02 MAR 94 / International Company News: Canada considers cutting oil
holding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Canada's Liberal government is considering a further cut in its 70 per cent
stake in Petro-Canada, the integrated oil and gas producer set up in the
mid-1970s to give Ottawa a window on the energy industry.
Ms Anne McLellan, Natural Resources minister, said she and the secretary of
state for finance were reviewing Petrocan's ownership.
'Everybody is saying that with share prices where they are, it may be time
for the federal government to take a look at what it wants to do,' she said.
Other, unspecified, options were also being considered.
The previous Progressive Conservative government began privatising Petrocan
in mid-1991, when it sold 42m shares to the public at CDollars 13 a share.
The share price began sliding shortly afterwards, reaching a low of CDollars
7.38 last year.
However, it has recovered sharply in recent months. The shares were trading
at CDollars 13.50 on the Toronto stock exchange yesterday.
A sweeping reorganisation, including asset disposals, and a jump in natural
gas prices have contributed to a significant improvement in financial
performance. Earnings totalled CDollars 162m (USDollars 120m) last year on
sales of CDollars 4.6bn.

FT  02 MAR 94 / International Company News: Glory days gone for discount
pioneer - Kmart's costly expansion and modernisation has turned sour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kmart, the US retailer and pioneer of the discount store concept in the
early 1960s, was rewarded for its invention for one fleeting moment in the
late-1980s, when it became the world's biggest retailer.
Now, in the 1990s, it is still near the top of the league in terms of annual
sales - but in terms of last year's profits, it looks like a company on the
ropes.
After five years of disappointing earnings, Kmart went from bad to appalling
with the figures it reported on Monday.
For the fourth quarter to January, it turned in net losses of Dollars 1.2bn,
compared with net profits of Dollars 535m last time. For the year as a
whole, it reported net losses of Dollars 974m, compared with net profits of
Dollars 941m a year earlier.
Admittedly, there were special factors at work. During the fourth quarter,
it incurred costs of nearly Dollars 1.9bn pre-tax for the disposal of some
operations and the restructuring of others.
However, even after stripping out all the unusual charges, and ignoring the
losses made by the discontinued operations, the group would only have shown
net income for the year of Dollars 534m - clearly unsatisfactory for a group
with sales of Dollars 34.2bn.
In contrast, Kmart's bigger rival, Wal-Mart, reported net income of Dollars
2.3bn on turnover of Dollars 67.3bn for the same period, even after
acquiring Kmart's loss-making Pace Membership Warehouse operations during
the year.
However it's not only the financial performance of the two companies that
separates them: they have also followed contrasting strategies.
While Wal-Mart has stuck closely to general merchandising, either through
its discount stores or membership warehouses, Kmart has bamboozled observers
with its changes of direction.
These started in the 1980s when, faced with growing competition from
Wal-Mart and other discount-store operators, it started looking for new
sources of profits growth.
Following Woolworth's example, it decided specialty retailing was the
answer, and set about using the cashflow from its discount stores to gain a
foothold in new sectors.
It bought or set up the PayLess Drug Stores chain, the Waldenbooks and
Borders book stores, the Sports Authority sporting goods shops, the Builders
Square home improvement stores, and the OfficeMax office supplies chain.
Confusingly, however, it also sought to expand in general merchandising by
making forays into the hypermarket or membership warehouse business, first
by taking a stake in the Makro hypermarket chain and then buying the Pace
Membership Warehouse operation. Both ventures proved unsuccessful, ending in
heavy write-downs.
Next, the core of its strategy started to weaken when it discovered that the
discount stores could not be relied upon to generate the cash required,
because they needed heavy investment to survive the competition from
Wal-Mart and other discount store groups.
In 1990, Kmart responded to the competitive threat by launching a costly
modernisation programme for the discount stores.
By 1992 it had reached its goal of refurbishing 450 stores a year. However,
it abruptly scaled back the programme, saying it wanted to consider
re-entering the hypermarket sector with a new Super Kmart format.
In January, another about-turn came when Kmart announced that the results
coming through from the refurbished discount stores were so good the
modernisation programme would resume, absorbing the larger part of a Dollars
1.3bn restructuring charge.
Meanwhile, back in retailing, the PayLess Drug Store chain produced
unimpressive results and was sold last year. Taken as a whole, the other
specialty retailing operations have delivered profits falling short of
target and, in January, Kmart announced it planned to sell between 20 and 30
per cent of their equity in a series of stock sales.
An optimistic view of Kmart's outlook for 1994 would be that all the bad
news had been cleared away, and that the company was poised for growth.
However, the state of the share price, hovering close to its 12-month low of
Dollars 18 3/4 , suggests that few in the market subscribe to that view.
Kmart's lack of a clear strategic direction is only one reason for the
pessimism.
The other is that it is not up to the competition with Wal-Mart because the
latter is simply a better retailer. Last year, for example, the poor
financial performance of Kmart's discount stores was largely explained by
the fact that it overstocked on goods that people did not want, and ran out
of things they did want.
Analysts say this does not happen at Wal-Mart, because it is ahead in using
technology to match what people want with what it stocks.
'Wal-Mart has a much better read of what is selling in its stores, so it
doesn't carry dead inventory,' says Ms Maureen McGrath of Smith Barney
Shearson, the Wall Street brokerage house.
Kmart has also invested in technology, but it has not been enough to stop
Wal-Mart's inexorable growth. Last year, Wal-Mart's sales - already twice
the size of Kmart's - rose by more than 20 per cent, and analysts believe
they will advance by another 20-25 per cent this year.
Since the market itself is barely growing, something else will have to give.
Seen in that context, Kmart's troubles seem far from over.

FT  02 MAR 94 / International Company News: Low newsprint prices keep
Abitibi in red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Low paper prices drove Abitibi-Price, the world's biggest newsprint
producer, to its fourth consecutive year of losses in 1993, writes Bernard
Simon.
The Toronto-based company said newsprint prices in North America had shown
no signs of recovery this year.
However, it was counting on a combination of higher offshore prices, a 7 per
cent cut in North American discounts, and price rise to lift operating
results during 1994.
Net losses last year totalled CDollars 121.7m (USDollars 90.1m), or CDollars
1.71 a share, a significant improvement on 1992's CDollars 220.9m deficit,
equal to CDollars 3.19 a share. The results include a narrowing in losses
from discontinued operations, to CDollars 13.4m from CDollars 27.8m.
Sales rose to CDollars 1.87bn from CDollars 1.60bn while operating losses
fell to CDollars 39.8m from CDollars 138.1m.

FT  02 MAR 94 / International Company News: Hunting in Argentina's bargain
basement - International companies are finding strong takeover targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mergers and acquisitions in Argentina once meant finding a local company to
take over the business of a multinational fleeing the country's political
and economic chaos.
But a successfully-completed Dollars 20bn privatisation programme, rapid
economic growth and pro-business government policies have put Argentina
firmly back on the international business map. Recently there has been a
rash of takeover announcements by foreign companies and more are expected.
Procter and Gamble bought food giant Bunge y Born's 78 per cent stake in
Compania Qumica, which makes detergents, for Dollars 52.5m.
RJR Nabisco signed a letter of intent with the owners of biscuit-maker EM
Terrabusi to buy out their controlling stake in the company, which has a
market capitalisation of Dollars 280m.
Chile's CNTI bought SAIAR, Argentina's leading maker of household water
heaters, for an undisclosed amount. Chilean investors have become aggressive
buyers of Argentine companies, buying into industries ranging from ceramics
to large portions of the privatised electricity sector.
In most cases, target companies are too small or badly-managed to survive
alone in Argentina's liberalised market. Often they are family-owned
businesses with succession difficulties, or face insurmountable financial or
technological problems.
Buyers are attracted by an economy expected to grow 5-6 per cent a year to
the end of the decade. Furthermore, the performance of most local companies
can be rapidly increased with strong management, capital and technology.
The Exxel Group, a Buenos Aires-based buy-out company, has bought paper,
soap and electricity companies and shows what strong management can achieve.
Mr Juan Navarro, Exxel president, says that at one of his acquisitions, 'we
cut overheads by 35-40 per cent, increased output by more than 60 per cent
in six months and cut 10 per cent of the staff'.
Multinationals usually look for branded mass consumption goods, with little
debt, where they can add value rapidly. The food industry is a leading
acquisition target. Argentina's pampas, those vast grasslands and wheat
prairies, make it a large-volume, low-cost agricultural producer.
As well as RJR Nabisco, food groups such as Nestle and Cadbury-Schweppes
have been buying companies in Argentina recently.
Results for the trailblazers have been impressive. In 1991, when US tobacco
and food giant Philip Morris acquired Swiss chocolate maker Suchard, the
Argentine subsidiaries of both companies came together just as the economy
began an unexpected recovery.
Mr James Stewart, Philip Morris's local general manager, says: 'We used the
retained earnings from Suchard to finance (later) acquisition of an ice
cream company and the Tang powdered drink company.' He says revenues from
the food business have risen fivefold and income 8.5 times since 1991.
The US investors who bought a bankrupt Pepsi bottler in 1989 have been even
more successful. The investors, led by Mr Charles Beach, paid a nominal sum
for the bottler Baesa, but invested more than Dollars 200m to build it into
a company with listings in New York and Buenos Aires and a market
capitalisation of Dollars 940m.
Mr Beach had seen the potential of a market with rising incomes and
repressed consumption. Argentines drink fewer soft drinks than consumers in
other developing countries. Mr Rafael Farace, Baesa's finance director, said
'promotion, marketing, efficient production, innovation and distribution
were the keys of our success'.
Sales grew to Dollars 268.8m last year from Dollars 31.5m in 1990. Margins
rose by a third to 41 per cent. Pepsico has awarded Baesa franchises in
Chile, Uruguay, southern Brazil and southern Argentina, and helped finance
the expansion by paying Dollars 35m for 26 per cent of Baesa.
As well as food, attention has focused on the underdeveloped but highly
promising financial services industry. The petrochemicals industry, until
recently given up for dead, is showing signs of recovery. Argentina has a
large number of small car parts companies, many of which are in need of
consolidation and radical reorganisation.
Inevitably, buyers arriving late at the party are having to pay higher
prices for less attractive companies. Argentina has few companies that turn
over more than Dollars 100m a year, and most are owned by families that
usually surrender control only as a last resort.
Putting a price on a company is hard at the best of times, especially as
accounting standards are lax. Furthermore, rapid economic change makes past
performance a poor guide to a company's value. Investment bankers say prices
have more than doubled in three years to an average 10-15 times earnings.
However, analysts believe British food and beverage group Cadbury-Schweppes
has paid too much for Stani, a local sweet company it bought last October.
Mr Stephen Ward, Cadbury's managing director for the Americas, will not
disclose the price, but says Stani was a good buy: 'Stani gets high marks
for leadership, management, with strong brands and a good position in the
marketplace.'
Despite rapid growth, Argentina, with a population of only 32.6m, is not a
big market. However, international companies striving for a global market
presence cannot ignore it.
The growing pace of trade with Chile and economic integration with Brazil
through the Mercosur customs union make the regional dimension increasingly
important. Mr Ward says Stani is a 'stepping stone' for Cadbury's expansion
in the region.

Radio Marconi, Portugal's international telecommunications operator,
yesterday announced a 14 per cent rise in consolidated net profits in 1993,
to Es4.2bn (Dollars 24.2m). Sales grew 16 per cent, to Es46.5bn, and
cashflow rose 17 per cent to Es9.2bn.
The private shareholders of Marconi, which is 51 per cent state-owned, will
decide this year on a government proposal to merge the company with
Portugal's three other wholly state-owned telecommunications operators. The
new company would be known as Portugal Telecom.
The government plans to privatise up to 49 per cent of Portugal Telecom, and
will sell part of the equity to a strategic foreign partner.
Mr Goncalo Sequeira Braga, president, said that despite recession in 1993,
Marconi reduced total debt from Es25.4bn in 1992 to Es19.3bn last year.
Market capitalisation more than doubled.

FT  02 MAR 94 / International Company News: Argentine banking opened still
further
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Financial institutions from the US and Europe are exploring the possibility
of starting operations in Argentina following a government decree last week
which further opened the banking system to foreign competition.
Mr Roque Fernandez, president of the central bank of Argentina, said those
applying to open branches included the financing arm of General Motors,
GMAC, and a Chilean group. Other applications were expected from US and
European banks.
Mr Fernandez was in London for talks with the Bank of England. He hopes to
persuade the Bank that his institution is capable of supervising Argentine
banks' international activities - thereby paving the way for the opening of
further Argentine bank offices in London. He is also talking to banking
authorities in Spain, the US and Japan.
Last week's decree brought protests from Argentine banks. Mr Fernandez said
the Argentine banking system was competitive - 200 financial institutions
were now operating compared with 800 in 1980. However, there has been
concern among businesses about high lending margins.

<TEXT>
Valenciana de Cementos, the leading Spanish cement producer which is
controlled by Cemex of Mexico, defied an overall decline in the cement
market last year and increased group after-tax profits by 58 per cent to
Pta5.61bn (Dollars 40.1m).
Part of the increase came from the inclusion of the last three months'
figures from Sanson, another cement producer brought into Valenciana last
year.
Both companies, formerly controlled by the Banco Espanol de Credito
(Banesto) banking group, were bought by Cemex in 1992.
Net operating profit for the group rose more than fourfold to Pta7.69bn,
mainly due to improved production processes and cost-cutting, as well as
price increases.
The group's sales, excluding those of Sanson, were 5.7 per cent down at
Pta48.07bn but the decline was less than half the estimated overall decline
in cement sales during the year. Including the Sanson figures, turnover was
Pta50.94bn, which was 4.3 per cent more than for 1992.
Valenciana, which represents about a third of Cemex's business worldwide,
said it expected a slight recovery in the market this year.

Falling loan losses and strong investment banking income helped Royal Bank
of Canada to lift first-quarter earnings by 18 per cent.
The bank, which is Canada's biggest financial institution, predicted that a
continuing improvement in its loan portfolio, plus higher productivity,
would provide a 'solid level of profitability' this year.
Net earnings rose to CDollars 300m (USDollars 222.2m), or 82 cents a share,
for the three months to January 31, from CDollars 254m, or 71 cents a share,
a year earlier. Return on equity improved to 17.9 per cent from 14.8 per
cent.
Assets climbed to CDollars 168.2bn from CDollars 137bn, with more than half
the increase due to last year's acquisition of Royal Trust, the ailing trust
and loan company formerly controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family.
Return on assets slipped fractionally to 0.72 per cent from 0.73 per cent.
RBC is emerging from a turbulent period, which included the Royal Trust
acquisition as well as a heavy exposure to the troubled property and
forestry industries. The bank has also been criticised for weak internal
management.
Earnings have tumbled from a record CDollars 965m in 1990 to CDollars 107m
in 1992 and a CDollars 420m fourth-quarter loss last year.
The bank noted yesterday, however, that fiscal 1994 loan losses were
expected to fall to CDollars 820m from CDollars 1.75bn last year. The
first-quarter loan-loss provision was CDollars 205m, down from CDollars 295m
last year.
Non-accrual loans totalled CDollars 3.21bn on January 31, equal to 2.6 per
cent of total loans and acceptances. This was slightly lower than three
months earlier, but the decline was slowed by a further CDollars 46m
increase in sour commercial property loans.
A further cushion is provided by the rising market value of the bank's Third
World debt portfolio.
The surplus has grown over the past quarter, from CDollars 415m to CDollars
550m. Any of this surplus realised during 1994 will be transferred to
general loan-loss provisions.
Bank of Nova Scotia reported a 19.5 per cent jump in first-quarter earnings,
to CDollars 197m, or 82 cents a share, from CDollars 165m, or 70 cents a
share. Return on equity rose to 14.7 per cent from 13.9 per cent.
The improvement was attributed largely to higher interest income and
stronger investment-banking earnings.

FT  02 MAR 94 / International Company News: Nokia returns to profit as
telecoms division surges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Nokia, the Finnish tele-communications group, yesterday reported a surge
back to profit as high growth in its mobile and fixed telephone divisions
produced a pre-tax profit in 1993 of FM1.15bn (Dollars 209m), compared with
a FM158m loss in 1992.
It is increasing its dividend to FM2.80 a share from FM2.
However, the group, the world's second largest supplier of mobile telephone
terminals after Motorola of the US, announced it was withdrawing from
manufacturing picture tubes in a bid to stem losses in its troubled consumer
electronics business.
It included a charge below the line of FM1.9bn mostly to cover the costs of
the move, leaving a net loss of FM1.15bn, compared with a net loss of FM723m
in 1992.
Mr Jorma Ollila, chief executive, said consumer electronics losses, at
FM747m in 1993, required 'very forceful actions'.
Efforts to find a partner or buyer for the picture tube making had so far
failed. The decision to shut down will mainly effect Nokia's Esslingen plant
in Germany on which it spent FM200m last year in a modernisation drive.
Nokia said it would continue to make televisions as these were important in
developing interactive communications and multimedia products. But it would
buy in picture tubes from outside suppliers.
The problems in consumer electronics contrasted with Nokia's fast growth in
telecommunications. Overall group sales were FM23.7bn, compared with
FM18.12bn, while research and development costs rose to FM1.47bn from
FM1.13bn. Operating profits jumped to FM1.46bn from FM288m.
The vast majority of Nokia's activities are outside Finland and it said it
was applying for a listing on the New York Stock Exchange, the first Finnish
company to do so.
Sales in the mobile telephone division surged by 73 per cent to FM6.3bn from
FM3.6bn. Nokia said sales of digital cellular telephones took off in 1993
and were expected to continue to grow rapidly, but it said demand for the
older technology analog systems remained strong. Operating profits for
mobile telephones more than doubled to FM950m from FM437m.
Sales in the fixed telecommunications division grew by 43 per cent to
FM4.6bn from FM3.2bn, while operating profit more than doubled to FM983m
from FM427m.
The cables and machinery division reported slower sales growth, pushing up
to FM4.9bn from FM4.6bn, but operating profits here again more than doubled
to FM261m from FM114m.
Nokia said it was confident it could sustain the rapid rate of sales growth
for mobile telephony in 1994 as it exploited growing markets, especially in
Germany, the US and Japan. Mr Ollila said this, combined with an improved
performance in the slimmed-down consumer electronics division, provided a
favourable outlook for 1994.

<TEXT>
The public offer in Banca Commerciale Italiana, one of Italy's leading
banks, closed last night, three days ahead of schedule - confirming the
success of the government's privatisation programme.
The shares went on sale on Monday at L5,400 each. There were indications
last night that only about a quarter of the 1m-plus people who had applied
for shares were likely to receive any.
In total, 260m shares were available to private investors. However, IRI, the
state holding company which was disposing of its entire 54 per cent stake in
the bank, placed a further 240m shares with institutions.
On the Milan stock exchange last night, BCI closed slightly lower at L6,026
amid heavy turnover.
Trading in the shares on sale in the public offer begins on March 17.
The heavy subscription follows similar strong demand for two earlier
privatisation issues.
IRI raised almost L1,750bn (Dollars 1bn) by selling its stake in Credito
Italiano in December and the government received almost L2,400bn from shares
in Istituto Mobiliare Italiano, the financial services group.
Credito Italiano, the Italian bank privatised last December, reported a 4.9
per cent increase in net profits to L218.6bn for 1993 as tax charges more
than doubled to L640bn.
During a year in which banks saw a sharp fall in interest rates, Credito's
gross operating income rose 86 per cent to L1,574bn. Interest income was up
11 per cent at L2,532bn while fee income more than doubled to L1,351bn.
Banca Ambrosiana Veneto (Ambroveneto) yesterday reported gross operating
income of over L790bn for last year, up 11 per cent on 1992.
The Milan-based bank, which will reveal net profits later this month, said
the outcome reflected its strategy of developing customer services, thus
lifting non-interest income.

FT  02 MAR 94 / International Company News: Krupp-Hoesch to fight cartel
office over ruling to sell unit

<TEXT>
Krupp-Hoesch, the merged German steel and engineering group, plans to fight
an order by the German federal cartel office to sell part of its vehicle
spring manufacturing capacity.
The company said it would challenge the ruling by the competition
authorities that it must sell its vehicle spring manufacturing division at
Krupp Bruninghaus because of its dominant position in the market.
An agreement to dispose of the division was an important part of the deal
negotiated by Krupp-Hoesch with the cartel office in April 1992 to get the
go-ahead for the total merger of the two steel groups.
However, just before the deadline to do so expired in December last year,
the company served notice of cancellation of the agreement, arguing that
conditions in the market had changed.
The cartel office in Berlin announced on Monday that it was not prepared to
accept the unilateral cancellation, and ordered Krupp-Hoesch to sell the
division, or it would appoint an independent trustee to do so on its behalf.
The office said a merger of the vehicle spring manufacturing capacity of
Krupp Bruninghaus with Hoesch-Federn would raise the danger of the combined
enterprise having a dominant market position. The two together would control
more than 60 per cent of the market, with a turnover of between
DM600m-DM700m (Dollars 353m-Dollars 412m).
Krupp-Hoesch maintains that because of a slump in demand for its suspensions
from the motor industry, the two vehicle spring divisions between them lost
more than DM50m in 1993. It said if one of the two divisions was sold, the
other could no longer survive.
'The conditions of competition in the automobile sub-contracting industry
have changed so much since the original agreement was reached that there is
no longer any reason to fear the emergence of market domination,' according
to Krupp-Hoesch.
The cartel office argues that other companies are still surviving in the
industry, many of them small or medium enterprises with a much smaller
turnover.
It accepts that the motor industry has reduced its orders because of the
current recession.
Krupp-Hoesch will now take the case to the superior court in Berlin,
although a delay of several months is likely before any decision is taken.

FT  02 MAR 94 / International Company News: Bank Austria bids for GiroCredit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM and REUTER

<DATELINE>
   VIENNA, ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bank Austria, Austria's largest bank, is bidding for control of GiroCredit,
the savings banks' clearing institution and a leading commercial bank in its
own right.
The object of the move - equivalent to an unfriendly takeover bid - is to
force a restructuring of the savings bank sector.
The bid is being made through Anteilsverwaltung Zentralsparkasse, BA's
biggest shareholder and holding company of the former Zentralsparkasse, the
Vienna city savings bank now merged into BA, which is offering to buy
GiroCredit shares from savings banks across the country.
It is offering a mixture of Sch370 cash per nominal Sch100 GiroCredit share
and/or the equivalent of Sch400 per Sch100 nominal GiroCredit shares in BA
bearer stock.
The offer expires on 18 March.
Bank Austria owns just under 31 per cent in GiroCredit. It aims to buy at
least another 20.4 per cent of GiroCredit's shares to raise its shareholding
to above 50 per cent.
BA's announcement came as a surprise, and it follows several earlier
unsuccessful attempts to restructure GiroCredit and the savings banks
sector.
Leading savings banks from Salzburg, Linz and Graz responded cautiously to
the bid, saying they would have to look at the offer in detail and compare
it to an earlier plan put forward by BA for a restructuring of the savings
banks.
This entailed selling about two-thirds of BA's holding in GiroCredit to a
consortium comprising the Erste Oesterreichische Spar-Casse, the second
largest savings bank, Austria Collegialitat Versicherung, a leading
insurance company, and the savings banks.
Erste which already owned about 21 per cent of GiroCredit was to buy a
further 10 per cent. But this plan - which had a February deadline - was
abandoned following disagreements over price.
All the savings banks including the Erste Spar-Casse which refused the
original plan, are due to meet today to discuss their response to the
takeover bid from BA.
Union Bank of Switzerland is making an agreed takeover bid for Regiobank
Beider Basel (Regio Bank), a northern Swiss regional bank, Reuter reports
from Zurich.
Regio has a balance sheet of SFr2.5bn (Dollars 1.7m) and about 200
employees.

FT  02 MAR 94 / International Company News: Cost-cutting helps Valmet
turnround
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Valmet, the Finnish paper machinery and engineering group, said yesterday
productivity and cost-cutting gains had helped it return to profit in 1993.
Profits after financial items were FM100m (Dollars 18.07m) compared with a
loss of FM298m in 1992.
Unspecified extraordinary charges of FM154m, mainly write-offs associated
with rationalisation moves, resulted in a pre-tax loss of FM54m, but this
was a sharp improvement over the pre-tax loss of FM219m in the previous
year.
Valmet said it would show a net profit of FM85m when its annual report was
published later this month, compared with a net loss in 1992 of FM120m,
although details were not given.
Group sales were up 11 per cent to FM10.7bn compared with FM9.6bn in 1992,
thanks in part to the fall in value of the Finnish markka last year. More
than 80 per cent of Valmet's sales were outside Finland, mainly in western
Europe and North America.
Operating profit improved sharply to FM479m from FM171m.
Valmet said its internal rationalisation programmes, coupled with the
prospect of more stable markets in the forestry industry, should produce a
further improvement in 1994.

rescue proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Karel Van Miert, the European competition commissioner, yesterday gave a
positive response to outlines of a restructuring and privatisation plan for
Groupe Bull, the loss-making French computer group.
He had a series of meetings with Mr Jean-Marie Descarpentries, Bull
chairman, Mr Gerard Longuet, the industry minister, and Mr Edouard Balladur,
the French prime minister. Mr Van Miert said that he had been impressed by
Mr Descarpentries' ideas and commitments.
During the meetings the French government agreed to freeze a tranche of
FFr2.5bn (Dollars 424m) of state aid for Groupe Bull pending the European
Commission's decision on the group's recapitalisation. This is the final
tranche of a FFr7bn capital increase announced last year by the government.
Mr Van Miert is due to receive a final version of Bull's plan within the
next few days. He said a decision on the plan could be reached by the
summer, and would not take more than six months.
Brussels' decision is regarded as crucial to the recovery of the group,
which has lost more than FFr15bn over the past four years. The French
government has said the capital injection was a necessary final payment to
allow the group to be privatised.
Mr Descarpentries aims to reduce the state's 76 per cent shareholding in
Bull to below 50 per cent this year. He plans to achieve this through an
increase in employee shareholdings and the participation of industrial
partners in the company's capital. NEC of Japan, which holds 4.4 per cent of
Bull, is seen as a potential candidate for a larger stake in the group.
According to the plan, productivity is to be increased through a separate
profit centre and tighter reporting procedures. Non-salary costs are to be
reduced through a sale of most of the company's Paris sites.

FT  02 MAR 94 / International Company News: Bellsouth in Spanish venture
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bellsouth, the US tele-communications group, has added Spain to its
expanding European business by forming a local consortium to bid for a
second cellular phone licence to be awarded later this year by the Madrid
government.
The consortium, called Reditel, allies the US group to Repsol, the Spanish
state-controlled energy conglomerate, two construction companies and to
eight savings banks.
Bellsouth will have a 25 per cent stake in the venture and Repsol 15 per
cent.
Reditel is one of several alliances, mixing foreign operators with domestic
companies, formed in the past year ahead of the liberalisation of Spain's
telecommunications industry. Rival consortia seeking a mobile phone licence
include GTE of the US and the UK's Vodaphone.
The government is expected to publish the tender requirements for operating
digital service cellular telephones within the next two months. Two licences
are to be awarded, one of which will be reserved for Telefonica, which is 32
per cent state owned and is the monopoly telecommunications operator in
Spain.
A mobile phone service that is already operated by Telefonica, using 450MHz
and 900MHz cellular radio networks, is earning the Spanish group about
Pta12bn (Dollars 85.7m) in operating profit on a Pta100bn turnover.
Local analysts said Spain's cellular system could have 1.8m subscribers by
1998, compared with 254,000 at present.
'Our emphasis is on the cellular business but we will be looking closely at
other areas as they become available,' Mr George Von Open, Bellsouth's chief
executive in Spain said.
The US group participates in mobile services in Denmark, France in Germany
and is bidding, as part of a consortium, for an Italian licence.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Crossroads Oil Group, the USM-quoted oil and gas exploration company, swung
back into the black with pre-tax profits of Pounds 156,000 for the six
months to end-December.
That compared with a deficit of Pounds 298,000 last time and came from
turnover - boosted by a Pounds 536,000 contribution from the
Crossroads-Melrose joint venture - up from Pounds 234,000 to Pounds 645,000.
There was a nil tax charge for both periods and earnings per share came out
at 0.286p (0.694p losses).
The company also announced that shareholders at yesterday's EGM had voted
unanimously in favour of a capital reconstruction to offset the deficit on
the profit and loss account.
Subject to completion of the reconstruction and sustained profitability, the
board intends to declare a dividend in 1994.

Royal Bank of Scotland is to introduce a new way of handling its business

first in its branches in Glasgow. The changes will later spread to the rest
of Britain as part of a programme that began two years ago and is costing up
to Pounds 400m.
The new system involves senior staff concentrating on specific categories of
customer rather serving both large and small customers. Branch managers will
stay in their jobs for at least four years, longer than at present.
It also entails installing more cash machines at branches and other sites,
and a 24-hour telephone banking service.

FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Admiral ahead 16% to Pounds 4.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Profits before tax at Admiral rose 16 per cent to Pounds 4.61m in 1993 as
the computing services company reaped the benefit of its move into defence
software and client-server technology.
Turnover was up 19 per cent at Pounds 36.6m (Pounds 30.9m) and operating
profit jumped 23 per cent at Pounds 4.35m (Pounds 3.53m).
Cash in hand at the year-end was Pounds 5.3m (Pounds 4.4m), but falling
interest rates resulted in a 43 per cent decline in net interest receivable,
from Pounds 452,000 to Pounds 260,000.
Admiral has maintained growth in sales, pre-tax profits and earnings per
share since it went public in 1987. It recruited new staff throughout the
recession. Last year staff numbers rose 20 per cent to 662 and now stand at
790. Mr Clay Brendish, chairman, said yesterday that Admiral was a dominant
force in the client-server marketplace which he believed would grow strongly
in the future.
Client-server systems replace centralised mainframe computing with
combinations of network servers and intelligent workstations.
The company is now active in the defence, finance, government and industrial
sectors with a growing presence - accounting for 9 per cent of sales - in
commerce. It provides computing services, software products and training and
has overseas operations in Australia and Singapore.
Earnings per share were 27.6p (24.2p) and a final dividend of 4.3p makes a
total for the year of 6.3p (5.4p). Dividend cover is 4.3 times.
Mr Brendish said there was good evidence of recovery in the economy and he
expected a further good year. Analysts are looking for growth of about 24
per cent for the current year giving profits before tax of about Pounds
5.7m.

FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Wm Sinclair at Pounds 1.3m in unseasonal
half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Both turnover and pre-tax profits eased in the first half at William
Sinclair Holdings, the supplier of products to the garden, leisure and pet
markets.
The Lincoln-based group reported profits of Pounds 1.35m on turnover of
Pounds 16.5m for the six months to end-December, compared with Pounds 1.39m
on Pounds 16.6m previously.
Net interest receivable fell from Pounds 192,000 to Pounds 92,000, mainly
reflecting lower interest rates.
The horticultural division was again affected by the continuing trend of
customers to defer taking delivery of stock.
The pet, aquatic and household division was also starting to find that an
increasing amount of sales took place in the second half.
However, horticultural deliveries were now beginning to pick up in readiness
for the gardening season.
Mr Tom Sinclair, chairman, said yesterday that the results were encouraging,
and had left the group in a good position to benefit in the second half.
'The better the weather is, the better we will perform in the next six
months.'
In January the group acquired Zeneca's compost business for Pounds 2.76m.
Turnover for the business for the 1993 year is estimated at Pounds 3.7m with
profits before tax and interest of Pounds 436,000.
Mr Sinclair said the acquisition had doubled the group's peat resources and
increased its share of the professional grower market.
Earnings per share dipped 4.4p to 4.2p. The interim dividend is maintained
at 1.7p.

FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: ASW recovery under way with modest Pounds
0.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASW Holdings, the steel and construction products group, announced pre-tax
profits of just Pounds 100,000 for 1993, but said it would return to
satisfactory profits when margins better reflected the industry's costs.
The outcome compared with a Pounds 10.8m loss in 1992, but is lower than the
Pounds 1m to Pounds 2m forecast by analysts in November, when the company
issued a profits warning because of rising scrap prices - its main raw
material - and reduced selling prices on the Continent.
Turnover rose from Pounds 367.8m to Pounds 428.5m, and operating profit on
continuing operations bounced from Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 8.1m. But
operating losses and provisions on discontinued operations - reinforcement
engineering in steel and fabrication on the construction side - were Pounds
4.1m (Pounds 7.8m) and net interest payable rose by Pounds 1m to Pounds
3.9m.
Losses per share were 0.7p, down from 16.2p. The final dividend is
maintained at 3p, making an unchanged total of 6p.
Operating profit in steel activities jumped to Pounds 9.4m from a loss of
Pounds 600,000 in 1992. This reflected Pounds 10.4m of margin improvements -
mainly in the second quarter but not maintained subsequently - and Pounds
2.1m from volume increases, offset by Pounds 2.5m of electricity price
increases.
Mr Alan Cox, chief executive, said the company had survived three years of
'awful' prices in the steel industry. But Allied Steel &amp; Wire had made
further improvements in productivity last year, with sales per employee
rising from Pounds 135,600 to Pounds 155,500.
He predicted further improvements in productivity and said there had been
some improvement in margins since the year-end. The issue of subsidies for
lossmaking competitors in Europe was coming under attack, he said, but
added: 'We object to people being subsidised to sell steel at below the cash
costs of the lowest-cost producer'.
The operating loss in construction systems deepened from Pounds 3.5m to
Pounds 4.2m, but Mr Edward Townsend, the new finance director, said
continuing operations were making significant progress - especially the new
stressing, tie and anchor systems - and a return to profitability is
expected this year.
COMMENT
At 190p, ASW's share price has recovered from the jolt caused by November's
profit warning, and the market is clearly betting that profits will rise
quickly when margins improve. There are some signs of margin improvement in
Europe, but demand for scrap is increasing as continuous production shifts
to electric arc furnaces, underpinning the price. Fortunately the company
remains on a roll when it comes to cost reduction, which in the short-term
might provide greater benefits than margin improvement. Based on pre-tax
profits of Pounds 4.8m to Pounds 5m this year, the prospective p/e is a
heady 50. That may look over-optimistic, but the yield is not out of line
with the sector and looks secure.

Dividend income was ahead at Pounds 1.68m (Pounds 1.36m), but a cut in
deposit interest earnings from Pounds 569,000 to Pounds 115,000 meant
revenue after tax was reduced from Pounds 203,000 to Pounds 133,000,
reducing earnings per share to 0.32p (0.49p).
No final dividend is recommended, leaving a total maintained at 0.3p.

<TEXT>
Shares in Cedardata, the Surrey-based accounting and financial management
software group, which is coming to market through a share placing, have been
priced at 105p valuing the group at Pounds 32.2m.
The company is best known for its modular Cfacs (Commercial and Financial
Accounts Systems) accounting software, which was launched in 1987 and now
has a strong blue-chip customer base.
Since the launch of Cfacs, turnover and profits have grown rapidly. Pre-tax
profits before non-recurring items, have risen from Pounds 430,000 in 1991
to a forecast Pounds 2.65m for the year to the end of March. Earnings of
6.1p per share are forecast, up from 4.2p last year.
As part of the placing of 13.7m shares, representing 44.75 per cent of the
enlarged ordinary share capital, the group is issuing 1.43m new shares to
raise funds for the development of Cfacs. The issue is sponsored by Greig
Middleton and the shares are due to begin trading on March 7.

FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: UK housebuilding lifts Raine 24% to Pounds
3.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits of Raine, the housebuilder and contractor, increased by 24
per cent from Pounds 2.76m to Pounds 3.44m over the six months to December
31.
The company was helped by a strong performance from UK private sector
housebuilding, which increased operating profits by 80 per cent. The
interest charge was also sharply reduced, from Pounds 2.05m to Pounds
891,000.
The figures, however, were dented by a Pounds 1.4m turnround in the
Californian housing operation, which moved from a Pounds 819,000 profit to a
Pounds 605,000 loss. As a result, Raine's operating profits were only
marginally higher at Pounds 4.61m (Pounds 4.55m).
Earnings per share rose from 0.83p to 1.06p but, as expected, the group
halved its interim dividend to 1p.
Turnover was virtually unchanged at Pounds 207m (Pounds 205.1m).
Mr Peter Parkin, chairman, said the company had lost sales following the Los
Angeles earthquake, which had not damaged any of its housing developments,
but business was picking up again.
Private sector house sales in the UK rose by 23 per cent to 803. The group
had increased margins by reducing sales incentives and the cost of part
exchange deals had halved.
Social housing profits fell in spite of a 21 per cent increase in sales,
from 482 to 584 homes.
Volumes should increase further in the second half with Raine benefiting
from its recent contract with a consortium of Kent housing associations to
build more than 1,500 homes over three years.
Contracting and commercial property profits, affected by low margins and
lower interest on cash payments, dipped at the pre-tax level from Pounds
817,000 to Pounds 715,000.
The shares fell 4p to 99p.
COMMENT
Raine's Californian problems, its exposure to recession-hit UK contracting
and uncertainty over the dividend has distracted attention from a creditable
performance by the UK housebuilding operations. Currently, operating margins
on private house sales are about 12 per cent and still about 6 per cent for
social housing. Increased sales should mean that social housing profits for
the year will be at least maintained. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 14m in
1993-94 would put the group on a prospective p/e of more than 20 - falling
to 14 times earnings on Pounds 20m in 1994-95. Over the past 12 months the
shares have underperformed the sector by 50 per cent. For a pure UK
housebuilder Raine might look cheap. The question is how quickly the
Californian housebuilding and UK contracting businesses may recover.

In addition, Sanderson has issued 278,636 shares to ICL for cash at 330p
each to raise Pounds 919,500, which will be used to repay Pounds 569,500 of
inter-company debt to ICL and provide working capital for Commercial
Systems.
A further consideration, of up to Pounds 1.95m, is profit rel-ated and may
be paid in shares.
Sanderson and ICL have agreed not to dispose of any Commercial Systems
shares without the other's consent until September 30 1996.

FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Dawson to make Pounds 50m provision for US
shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dawson International, the Edinburgh-based textile group, is closing its
fleece and jersey business in the US and taking a Pounds 50m exceptional
provision for the year to March 26 1994.
The rationalisation was announced yesterday following an independent review
of Dawson's US businesses, which had sales of Pounds 214m in 1992-93, about
half the group total.
Last month the shares fell to 134p after the group warned that difficult US
trading conditions would lead to 'a very substantial exceptional provision
this year.'
Yesterday they closed down 5p at 153p.
Dawson is also considering the sale of Dawson Home Fashions, which makes
shower curtains and bath mats.
Although it had 60 per cent of the US market last year, DHF has been hit
badly by import penetration. Operating profits in the six months to
September 25 amounted to just Pounds 300,000 on turnover of Pounds 30.4m.
The fleece and jersey business lost Pounds 8.9m on sales of Pounds 29.1m in
the same period. Known as JE Morgan Apparel, it operates 12 plants and has
2,000 employees.
Sir Ronald Miller, executive chairman, said the three plants making fleece,
which is used in jogging suits, would be closed.
Three of the remaining plants are dedicated to making jersey, which is used
for T-shirts and underwear.
These would be reorganised, along with the jersey-making operations of the
mixed plants, with a view to a possible sale.
Dawson went into the jersey and fleece business in 1989, and was a supplier
to Kmart, the US retailing group. Sir Ronald said the business had been hit
by excess capacity in the US, imports, lower sales in the recession and the
battle between US retailers. He pointed out that Kmart lost Dollars 1bn
(Pounds 600m) in the fourth quarter.
Goodwill of Pounds 42m from the purchase of JE Morgan will need to be
written off through the profit and loss account.
A further Pounds 14m will need to be written off if the shower curtain
business is sold.
The group's net debt at March 26 is expected to be about Pounds 70m.
It also has Pounds 27.9m of convertible preference shares.
Dawson has two further businesses in the US, Morgan and Duofold, which make
thermal underwear and other clothing. The group expects this year's results
to be better than last year's.
Sir Ronald said the rationalisation would enable the company to concentrate
on its profitable US operations.

FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Silentnight shares lose 18p on warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Silentnight Holdings fell 18p to 355p yesterday after Europe's
biggest manufacturer of beds warned that its profits for the year to January
31 would be 'slightly below average market expectations'.
Analysts had been forecasting pre-tax profits of about Pounds 13.5m.
However, the Lancashire-based group said that its annual results on May 3
would be only marginally ahead of last year's figure of Pounds 12m.
Silentnight said it intended to hold the final dividend of 5.25p, to give an
unchanged total of 8p.
The group said that in the UK it had maintained volume in its beds division
and increased volume in cabinets, but margins had been under pressure.
The previously lossmaking US business was continuing to recover, and the
German subsidiary, Matthias Houben - bought in 1992 for Pounds 3.2m - was
showing a very satisfactory return on investment.
The group said it had been conscious of the need to inform the market at the
same time that trading had been disappointing. One factor in the decision
had been the Stock Exchange's recent guidance on the disclosure of
price-sensitive information.

Net asset value at Newmarket Venture Capital was unchanged at 62p over the
12 months to December 31.
The split between investments and net current assets, however, was greatly
different as the company continued its programme of asset realisation begun
in 1990.
At the end of the period investments made up 63 per cent (86 per cent) of
net assets with quoted shares and unquoted investments falling from Pounds
16.9m to Pounds 11.6m.
There was a pre and post-tax loss for 1993 of Pounds 157,000 (Pounds 1.32m)
giving losses per share of 0.43p (3.65p).
Details of the company's voluntary liquidation and distribution of assets
are expected to be sent to shareholders in May this year.

IMC Industries, the USM-quoted soft drinks, video tapes and in-flight
entertainments company, reported pre-tax profits down from Pounds 202,000 to
Pounds 165,000 in the six months to October 31.
The company also announced the purchase of Eurotrade (UK), Creation
Entertainments and 50 per cent of Wideworld Trading for Pounds 143,000 cash
and 25 per cent of the enlarged share capital of IMC Video. All are involved
in marketing videos.
IMC has the option to acquire the 25 per cent at a profit-related price not
exceeding Pounds 450,000. Eurotrade and Creation have net assets of about
Pounds 22.5m. Wideworld has only recently begun trading. All three companies
are controlled by Mr Brian Phipps, a director of IMC.
The company, of which the ultimate holding company is Cursitor (Fifty Two),
said demand for its two main products, soft drinks and video tapes, had
remained weak. Further rationalisation had taken place at Alpine Soft Drinks
and new titles introduced by IMC Video.
Turnover was Pounds 2.73m (Pounds 2.97m). Earnings per share came out at
0.07p (0.09p).

FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Inveresk turns in 60% rise to Pounds 9.26m
 -Margins improved by focusing on higher value-added products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Inveresk, the Scottish speciality paper manufacturer which floated on the
Stock Exchange last June, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 9.26m in the 53
weeks to December 4 1993.
The result was a 60 per cent improvement on the Pounds 5.79m recorded in
1992. In both years the company incurred a loss of about Pounds 900,000 on
discontinued activities.
Turnover on continuing activities increased by 3 per cent to Pounds 90.5m
(Pounds 87.9m). The company attributed part of its improved profits to the
ending last year of unprofitable commodity papermaking at its mill at
Inverkeithing, Fife.
By focusing on higher value-added products and turning round its fine paper
business, operating margins have been increased to more than 10 per cent,
according to Mr Stefan Kay, managing director.
Mr Kay said that the recovery in the UK paper market was 'nervous, patchy
and uneasy.'
Confidence in the German market has taken a serious knock during the year
because of recession, though sales of Inveresk's products held up well.
Trading elsewhere in Europe was satisfactory, Mr Kay added, while sales to
east Asia and the Americas continued to be encouraging and with considerable
scope for the future.
Inveresk invested Pounds 7.2m in plant improvements, paid for out of cash
flow, and plans to invest a further Pounds 6.5m in 1994.
Earnings per share were 16.9p (11.5p) and a final dividend of 3.5p is
recommended. There was no interim dividend and Inveresk said on flotation
that the final dividend would be two thirds of a normal dividend.
COMMENT
Inveresk is a solid company with experienced management in a moderately
profitable niche of the paper market, factors which helped push its shares
up from last June's issue price of 150p to 223p, before adding another 7p to
230p yesterday. Its stated aim is to become 'Europe's leading speciality
paper company', and it hopes to find a suitable target for acquisition in
Europe or the UK. With Pounds 41m on its balance sheet and an unused
borrowing facility of Pounds 20m, it should be well equipped to do so.
Inveresk may be able to profit from higher market prices and exploit its 20
per cent unused capacity, but could also suffer if wood pulp costs, now
beginning to increase, go up further. Last year it enjoyed a tax charge of
only 9 per cent because of allowances from past losses; this year, however,
the tax charge will be 28 per cent, and analysts believe pre-tax profits up
to only Pounds 10m will be possible. That would mean reduced earnings per
share of 13.7p, giving a multiple of 16.7 on yesterday's closing price of
230p. On that basis the shares look fairly priced.

FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help Kalon increase to Pounds
18.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bucking the general trend in the UK paints market, Kalon, the paints group,
again achieved sharp profits growth and increased market share in 1993 on
turnover boosted largely by acquisitions.
Under FRS 3, pre-tax profits jumped 77 per cent to Pounds 18.8m (Pounds
10.6m), though stripping out 1992's Pounds 2.62m exceptional charges -
Pounds 1.56m for the abortive bid for Manders, then a rival paints maker,
and Pounds 1.06m on the disposal of the chemicals division - reduces the
advance to 42 per cent from Pounds 13.2m. Of the Pounds 18.8m profits,
Pounds 4.82m came from acquisitions, mainly Novodec, the French
private-label paints maker bought for Pounds 22m in February 1993.
Turnover grew by 34 per cent to Pounds 142.4m (Pounds 106.3m) including
Pounds 34.1m from acquisitions. There was a turnround in interest - from
Pounds 660,000 receivable to Pounds 150,000 payable. Mr Mike Hennessy,
managing director, said this was because of the debt acquired with Novodec,
higher financing charges and lower UK rates. Cash balances stood at Pounds
10.2m at the year-end, against Pounds 12.3m.
In the decorative division, where sales were flat at Pounds 96.1m and
profits up 6 per cent at Pounds 13.5m, retail paint sales slipped 1 per cent
in both volume and value terms, while the total market fell by 7 per cent.
Trade paint sales rose 15 per cent in volume and 11 in value as the market
fell by 4 per cent in value. Total market prices fell by 4 per cent as the
DIY sheds engaged in aggressive promotional activity.
Kalon said there was evidence this had abated and that prices were now more
stable, though raw material prices were edging up.
The opening of 12 more Leyland trade centres is planned for 1994, to make 87
in all. The aim is for a chain of 110.
In the specialist products division, now called Vallance since February's
acquisition of that company for Pounds 6.2m, sales were Pounds 6.5m and
profits Pounds 500,000.
Mr Hennessy said that total sundry sales were Pounds 25m-Pounds 26m with
Pounds 19m paint-related. The Vallance-enhanced division is expected to have
sales of about Pounds 18m-Pounds 20m next year, with total sundries sales of
up to Pounds 40m.
With the French market - where Mr Hennessy said prices were crazy - up 10.5
per cent in volume, Novodec rose by 19.5 per cent. The Leyland brand was
launched into France last week coinciding with the opening of the first
trade centre in Lille.
Earnings under FRS 3 advanced 91 per cent to 9.88p (5.17p), or, otherwise,
by 37 per cent from 7.2p. A final dividend of 2.9p makes at 4.2p total, up
31 per cent.
COMMENT
The inexorable rise of Kalon continues. And there is nothing in the
tea-leaves to suggest that this progress will falter. This is good news for
Mr Hennessy's now infamous and whopping triennial bonus scheme, now due. In
private paints - a mature business, which Kalon had a big hand in developing
 -it has done well in difficult market conditions; witness ICI's dour
comments last week. Trade paints - a developing business, especially in
France - did even better. Expect both organic and acquisition-led growth in
Europe to build on the French progress. In sundries - a newish market worth
up to Pounds 500m - Kalon has a lot to play for, while other territories in
Europe offer the group opportunities to replicate what it has achieved in
the UK and increasingly in France. Forecast pre-tax profits for 1994 are
between Pounds 21.5m and Pounds 22.5m, giving a p/e of between 16.3 and
15.5, which is cheap.

FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: TR Euro Growth launches issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TR European Growth Trust, a specialist smaller companies investment trust,
is planning to raise new capital through a conversion share issue.
The trust currently has assets of about Pounds 73m. The C share issue is
understood to be likely to increase that by at least one third, but if
demand is there, the trust's size could double.
TR European Growth invests mainly in quoted companies capitalised at less
than Pounds 200m, though it also has a small portfolio of unquoted
companies, particularly ones which are likely to seek a listing in the
future.
The company said there were clear signs of recovery in smaller company share
prices, a feeling which appeared to be shared by other fund managers.
The non-UK smaller companies investment trust area is highly active at the
moment, with the launch of the Piper European Smaller Companies Trust and
the Govett Global Smaller Companies Trust, and another C share issue under
way from Fleming European Fledgeling.
'We feel very strongly that the European story is something that is going to
go through over the next couple of years, and smaller companies are going to
out-perform the bigger ones,' said Mr James de Sausmarez, managing director
of Hen-derson Touche Remnant Investment Trust Management.
TR European Growth's net asset value grew by 31 per cent to 154.3p (99.2p)
per ordinary share over the half year to December 31.
Earnings per share were up 66 per cent to 1.01p (0.61p). The trust pays a
single dividend at the year end.

FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Expansion at Yorkshire Water
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yorkshire Water's strategy to increase its presence in the clinical waste
sector gathered momentum yesterday with the purchase of Dyvell (Holdings)
for Pounds 5.2m.
Mr Jonson Cox, managing director of Yorkshire Environmental, said the
addition of Dyvell would propel the clinical waste division into the 'number
one slot' with a market share of between 20 and 25 per cent.
Dyvell is, in effect, a start-up business with just one incinerator and
several contracts to build further facilities to process clinical waste for
health authorities and hospital trusts.
The threat of increased environmental regulation from the EC and loss of
crown immunity in the UK mean that trusts and authorities are seeking
improved methods of disposal.
Some Pounds 30m is budgeted for investment in new incinerators for the
enlarged division. This will mean that the clinical waste operation is
unlikely to produce a profit for about two years.
The group further strengthened its business with the Pounds 6.1m purchase of
a profitable environmental laboratory group in the Netherlands. Yorkshire
will integrate this with ALcontrol, its existing laboratory business.

FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Markheath in reverse takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Markheath, the heavily indebted property company, is to acquire Thomas
Bailey Investments in a reverse takeover by the privately owned Welsh
property developer.
The conditional deal will mean that Markheath, which has had a standstill
agreement with its bankers since last March, will change its name to TBI and
move its headquarters from London to Cardiff.
It will have a portfolio of commercial and retail properties and development
sites in London, Stevenage and south Wales valued at Pounds 96.3m, yielding
about 10 per cent.
Of Markheath's bank borrowings of Pounds 67.7m, about Pounds 25m will be
written off by banks led by Midland and ANZ, Pounds 22m will be refinanced
by a new term loan from Barclays and the balance satisfied with the majority
of the proceeds from a Pounds 24m share placing and open offer.
The share placing and offer - on an 11-for-17 basis of 79m new ordinary
shares at 33p - is underwritten by Charterhouse.
The new shares will represent 64.7 per cent of the enlarged capital. Mr
Stanley Thomas, a principal shareholder in Thomas Bailey, and Mrs SM Case,
his sister, will subscribe for up to 22.7m of the shares.
Mr Michael Rendle, non-executive chairman of Markheath since 1991, will
become non-executive chairman of TBI and three Thomas Bailey directors will
join the board. Mr Thomas and Mr Paul Bailey will be deputy chairman and
executive director and Mr Paul Guy chief executive.
The three new directors will receive a 30.3 per cent stake in the enlarged
capital for selling their company to Markheath.
Dealings in Markheath shares have been suspended at 6p pending shareholders'
approval of the restructuring at an extraordinary meeting on March 24. Old
shares will be consolidated on a 20-for-1 basis.
Markheath incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.37m in the six months to
September 30 last year with net liabilities of Pounds 14.8m, including bank
borrowings of Pounds 67.7m.
It ran into trouble with the downturn in the commercial property market and
also made losses totalling Pounds 37m on the sale of investments in Frogmore
Estates and Camford Engineering.
Its property portfolio has been written down by Pounds 75m over the past two
years and staff have been reduced from 150 to 10.
Thomas Bailey made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 422,000 in the seven months to
November 30 with net assets of Pounds 6.7m.

FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Direct selling expansion by GRE
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Guardian Royal Exchange, the fifth largest of the UK's composite insurers,
has signalled a sharp intensification of competition in the Pounds
6bn-a-year motor insurance market with yesterday's launch of Guardian
Direct, its own direct telephone-based insurer.
The group, which announced it was dropping Royal Exchange from its title on
Monday, will invest heavily in the subsidiary, spending at least Pounds 10m
on advertising and marketing in its first year of operation.
It will compete in a market headed by Direct Line, the Royal Bank of
Scotland subsidiary which insures 1.4m of the UK's 18.5m motorists.
'This is the first time a composite has made a heavyweight decisive move
into the market,' said Mr Ray Pierce, managing director.
He claimed that the 'sheer weight' of investment in advertising and
marketing would create brand awareness, allowing the company to grow
rapidly.
The company is expected to underwrite both home and motor insurance.
Based in Colchester, Guardian Direct will initially employ 160 people, of
whom 80 will be telesales staff. 'Volume is important,' said Mr Pierce.
GRE has been slow to move into the direct market, partially because of its
dependence on business generated by brokers and building societies. It had
also been reluctant to alienate the brokers with which it traditionally does
motor business.
General Accident, Eagle Star and Royal Insurance have all formed direct
writing subsidiaries, but their growth rate has been more modest than that
of Direct Line and Churchill, a subsidiary of Winterthur, the Swiss insurer.
Mr Pierce, who joined GRE after spells as chief executive of Robson Rhodes,
the accountant, and the Mortgage Corporation, said the company would be the
'strategic late entrant' and could equip itself with technology superior to
many competitors.
'The systems of some of our competitors are already out of date,' he said.
Although Guardian Direct will be operated separately from GRE's existing
motor business, it will be able to take advantage of facilities already set
up by its parent, such as a network of 500 approved repair centres for
damaged cars.
Guardian Direct aims to compete on both service and price. The company will
handle claims over the telephone and settle bills direct. Marketing material
suggests 'policyholders can save up to 30 per cent off conventional motor
and household policies'.

FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Domnick Hunter to raise Pounds 16m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The flotation of Domnick Hunter is expected to raise about Pounds 16m in new
money for the north-east of England-based engineering group which claims to
be a world leader in filtration products.
The flotation, by way of a placing, will give the group a market
capitalisation of about Pounds 60m. It is expected that impact day will be
March 16 and that dealings will start on March 29. Of the net proceeds,
about Pounds 9.9m will be used to redeem preference shares and Pounds 5.4m
will be used to reduce group borrowings.
The group has a dominant role in the UK compressed air filter market, and
exports more than 60 per cent of sales to 40 countries. Last year it made
operating profits of some Pounds 4.7m on turnover of Pounds 30.6m.
A pathfinder prospectus was published yesterday.

FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: T Cowie beats City forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sharply lower interest costs helped T Cowie, the car leasing, motor trading,
bus and tractor group, achieve a 56 per cent increase in pre-tax profits
last year to Pounds 38m.
The advance, from Pounds 24.3m in 1992, was ahead of market expectations and
Cowie's shares closed up 7p at 331p.
Turnover grew to Pounds 799.8m (Pounds 605.9m) including Pounds 148m
generated by the Keep Trust motor group of 18 dealerships acquired for
Pounds 28.6m last May.
Earnings per share improved by 55 per cent to 20.8p (13.4p). A final
dividend of 5.5p (4.25p) makes 7.85p, up 26 per cent.
Mr Gordon Hodgson, chief executive, said the results highlighted that 'the
company car market is returning to normality,' with fleet renewals
continuing to improve.
Operating profits, including a Pounds 2.54m contribution from Keep Trust,
slipped to Pounds 58.8m (Pounds 61.7m) mainly reflecting the impact of
falling interest rates on the core finance division and lower margins in the
acquired motor dealerships.
Offsetting this, the group recorded a net Pounds 3.82m exceptional gain
mainly reflecting proceeds from share transactions compared with a net
exceptional gain of Pounds 805,000 in 1992. Pre-tax profits were boosted by
a sharp decline in interest costs and similar charges to Pounds 24.6m
(Pounds 36.2m).
On a divisional basis, the finance division, which mainly comprises
market-leader Cowie Interleasing, reported lower turnover of Pounds 230.3m
(Pounds 245m), but a 43 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 23.7m
(Pounds 16.6m).
The motor division lifted its contribution to Pounds 8.53m (Pounds 5.48m) on
turnover of Pounds 518.5m (Pounds 316.3m), partly reflecting the Keep Trust
acquisition.
Grey-Green, the group's London bus and coach operator, increased turnover to
Pounds 14.4m (Pounds 13.5m) but profits declined to Pounds 1.6m (Pounds
1.8m) because of increased insurance costs.
Hughes DAF, the national bus and coach distribution business, lifted
turnover by 20 per cent to Pounds 16.1m and profits by 29 per cent to Pounds
2.26m.
Net borrowings of Pounds 288m at end-December were down from Pounds 308.7m a
year earlier and represented gearing of 212 per cent, down from 306 per
cent.
COMMENT
The acquisition of Keep Trust has boosted Cowie into the big league of UK
motor retailers. In the short term, however, it has eroded operating margins
in the motor division - the new dealerships generated Pounds 1,763 of
profits per employee in the final 9 months last year, still way behind the
Pounds 4,891 per head generated in the established Cowie dealerships.
Squeezing more profits out of the new dealerships coupled with the growth of
contract hire and stronger fleet market should boost pre-tax profits to
about Pounds 43.5m this year, producing earnings of 23p. Despite the recent
increase in the share price they are still only trading on a forward
multiple of 14.4 and could go higher.

FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Coal Invs plans to raise Pounds 11.5m for
development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coal Investments, formerly known as Geevor, plans to raise Pounds 11.5m to
develop two pits for which it has agreed terms with British Coal to mine for
15 years.
It will raise Pounds 3.5m through the issue of loan stock to shareholders
and Pounds 8m through new shares at 65p, half of which will be placed and
half distributed through a 1-for-8 rights issue.
The shares were suspended at 76p three weeks ago, pending talks with British
Coal and the financial arrangements announced yesterday. Dealings are
expected to resume on March 28 following an extraordinary meeting.
The two pits, Hem Heath, part of the Trentham mine, and Coventry, will be
among the first to be licensed by British Coal.
Coal Investments is also the front runner for the lease to mine Markham Main
colliery in South Yorkshire and may bid for two others.
The company started mining coal yesterday at Cwmgwili, south Wales, its only
working pit. It plans to produce 120,000 tonnes a year and to make slightly
more than Pounds 1m in operating profits on turnover of Pounds 6m at the
mine, ahead of previous budgets.
The arrangements announced yesterday will lead to the issue of 12m shares.
In addition shareholders will receive warrants to buy one share at 85p for
every four shares they take up in the rights. Shareholders will also be able
to subscribe for zero coupon loan stock which will repay Pounds 1 for each
60p paid, equivalent to a gross yield of 13 per cent. The stock will also
have warrants attached.
COMMENT
As former commercial director of British Coal, Mr Malcolm Edwards, the
chairman, has a strong background in sales techniques, which has stood him
in good stead at Coal Investments. His ability to sell the potential coal,
not to mention the story, of Coal Investments has been crucial in the shares
rising by more than four times in the first five months after its
re-incarnation. He sounded convincing again yesterday as he spoke of how his
company could rely on sales of at least 2m to 3m tonnes a year by
concentrating on industrial and household markets: sales to electricity
generators would be additional. We will have to wait to see if this is
fulfilled. The company does not expect to be making money until the year
after next. Charles Stanley, its broker, believes at least Pounds 2.7m is
likely for the year ending March 1996, putting the shares on a prospective
p/e for that year of 11. These are early days yet and the uncertainty of a
declining coal market means that the rights issue is not one for those with
limited funds. But the company's cash generative potential and its
relatively small capitalisation may prove attractive for institutions which
can bear some risk in their portfolios.

FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Wainhomes to raise Pounds 32m from placing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wainhomes, the Chester-based housebuilder, plans to raise Pounds 32m from a
placing and offer for sale valuing the company at about Pounds 100m.
The company is the latest in a series of housebuilders to announce plans to
come to the market.
Redrow, one of the UK's largest private housebuilders, is expected to
announce proposals to float the company today .
Beazer Homes - the country's fourth largest housebuilder, presently owned by
Hanson - last week published its pathfinder prospectus for an issue expected
to raise Pounds 450m.
Details of the Wainhomes issue, but not the price, were contained in a
pathfinder prospectus published yesterday.
Until recently Wainhomes only built homes mainly in north-west England.
The company will use the proceeds to repay borrowings - currently Pounds 17m
 -and to buy land to take advantage of the recovery in the housing market in
the UK.
Directors and their families now own 65 per cent of the shares. They will
have their stake reduced to just under 50 per cent following the issue.
The company is forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.1m for the year to
March 31. This compares with profits of Pounds 5.3m in the previous year and
a peak of Pounds 8.6m in the 12 months to March 31 1990.
Mr Ron Smith, chief executive, said the company had been remarkably
resilient during recession. Operating margins had remained above 10 per
cent, having reached a peak of 18 per cent in 1990.
The company now has operations in Yorkshire, Hampshire, Dorset and the
south-east Midlands. It expects to have sold about 950 homes by the end of
March.
This is expected to rise to between 1,200 and 1,500 next year, and then to
1,800.
The cash raised by the issue will help the group increase the number of
plots with planning permission it owns from 3,000 to 4,000.

FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Rolls-Royce Power sells Victor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rolls-Royce Power Engineering is selling Victor Products, its specialist
lighting subsidiary, through a Pounds 10m management buy-in backed by 3i,
the venture capital group.
Mr Keith Jordan, a former divisional managing director at GEC, will take
over as chief executive of the engineering company.
Victor Products, which was a listed company until February 1988, is raising
Pounds 6m through equity finance and Pounds 6m through bank debt, to cover
the costs of the purchase and build up working capital.
The new management will own 20 per cent of the equity, and the remainder has
been underwritten by 3i, which is likely to bring in two other venture
capital groups.
Victor Products is based in north-east England and manufactures hazardous
area lighting, primarily for the mining and oil and gas industries.
Its reliance on the mining industry has been heavily reduced since the
1980's, although British Coal remains a sizeable customer. It has also
developed subsidiaries in South Africa and the US.
Mr Jordan plans to introduce new lighting products and expand the company's
export markets, which currently account for only 10 per cent of domestic
production.
Victor Products has had a turbulent recent history. It was bought out for
Pounds 13.8m by Northern Engineering Industries in January 1988 and a year
later, its parent company was taken over by Rolls-Royce.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Westland attacks value of hostile bid from GKN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Westland, the UK's only helicopter manufacturer, yesterday dismissed a
Pounds 496m hostile bid from the engineering group GKN as 'absurdly low'.
Westland said the takeover bid, launched last month, undervalued its growth
prospects and Pounds 1.4bn order book.
Launching the defence document, Mr Alan Jones, chairman, said: 'There is no
logic in linking with an engineering conglomerate focusing on automotive and
industrial services sectors. The way forward for us is through collaboration
with other helicopter manufacturers.'
Nevertheless, GKN remains in a strong position, having raised its Westland
stake to 45 per cent with the purchase of an 18.7 per cent holding from
United Technologies, the US parent of Sikorsky helicopters.
GKN, which has pointed to synergies between helicopters and its armoured
vehicles division, has offered Westland shareholders 290p cash per share,
which compares with yesterday's close of 329 1/2 p. The bid values the whole
group at Pounds 496m.
Mr Jones claimed GKN's offer document suggested that 44p of the price
related to a Pounds 385m payment due to Westland from the Arab Organisation
for Industrialisation (AOI) for alleged breach of contract. This meant that
the GKN offer valued Westland's underlying business at only 246p a share.
'That is equivalent to 21.4 times historic earnings, which undervalues the
company. The average price earnings multiple for UK aerospace manufacturers
is almost 60 per cent higher at 34,' said Mr Jones.
Sir David Lees, GKN chairman, said the earnings multiple figures were
'meaningless' and warned there was no guarantee that the AOI would pay.
'There is nothing new in this defence. We expected something about firm
orders,' he said.
He also questioned Westland's claim that the value of its helicopter
deliveries could rise from Pounds 10m this year to Pounds 360m by the year
2000. 'They've admitted some of these potential orders may fall away
entirely. There is only one firm order for this year and two for 1995.'

FT  02 MAR 94 / Underwriting gains push GA to record Pounds 295m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Accident, the composite insurer, yesterday provided further evidence
of the recovery in the UK general insurance market by posting its highest
ever profit figures. Pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 294.9m last year,
compared with a Pounds 29.3m loss in 1992. The final dividend was increased
by 4.4 per cent to 17.8p per share, making a total of 27.5p against 26.75p.
As with Guardian Royal Exchange, Royal Insurance and Commercial Union, GA's
turnround hinged on an improvement in the UK, where underwriting profits of
Pounds 59.7m for the year - and Pounds 32m for the fourth quarter - were
reported.
'Our early action on rates and operating costs has produced a very
significant recovery,' said Mr Nelson Robertson, chief executive.
'Determination to underwrite for profit and not volume has had a very
considerable impact.'
In motor, underwriting profits amounted to Pounds 11.1m against a loss of
Pounds 46.8m. Premium income increased by 4.8 per cent to Pounds 252.7m.
However, the company reduced its exposure from 750,000 policies to 660,000,
reflecting a planned reduction on the non-comprehensive side.
Overall UK premium income increased from Pounds 1.25bn to Pounds 1.38bn.
Results from the US - where GA obtains 32 per cent of its premium income -
improved with underwriting losses falling from Pounds 210.5m to Pounds
140.4m. However, in Canada, where GA is the biggest player following an
acquisition last year, underwriting losses more than doubled to Pounds
44.1m.
Mr Robertson said GA had benefited from a reduced level of catastrophe
losses in the US, but had been hit by storm losses and the need to
strengthen reserves in Canada. The company is keen to expand in the Pacific
region - it has market shares of 5-7 per cent in Malaysia, Hong Kong and
Singapore.
Mr Robertson said the balance of the group's account could shift towards
North America and the Pacific. 'There is nothing in our plan which says the
UK has to provide us with a third of our total income.' The company has some
capital which it could use for expansion, following a strengthening of its
balance sheet. Its solvency margin - net assets as a percentage of non-life
premiums - amounted to 57.4 per cent at the year-end, up from 41.5 per cent.
Overall, general premium income rose to Pounds 4.18bn from Pounds 3.83bn.
Life premiums amounted to Pounds 866.1m, against Pounds 790.4m and profits
on the life side were Pounds 49.1m, compared with Pounds 34.8m. Investment
income rose to Pounds 509.1m, from Pounds 504.9m. Losses from the estate
agencies halved to Pounds 9.5m. Underwriting losses fell to Pounds 229m from
Pounds 510.1m. Interest on loans fell to Pounds 15.9m, from Pounds 40.1m.
Payments under the employee profit sharing scheme amounted to Pounds 8.9m.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Profits rise 25% at Abbey National: Banking group lifts
dividend 22% and reduces cover target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Abbey National, the banking group, yesterday announced a 25 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits for 1993 to Pounds 704m, from Pounds 564m. The
board is recommending an increase in the full-year dividend of 22 per cent
to 14p.
Lord Tugendhat, Abbey chairman, said that given the good results and
prospects for the group, the board had moved away from its earlier aim of
dividend cover of three times or more, and concluded that cover of between
two and three times was appropriate. The recommended 1993 dividend is
covered 2.1 times by earnings.
The greatest proportional profit rises came from the group's treasury and
life assurance oper-ations, while the core UK retail banking business rose
14 per cent to Pounds 618m.
Pre-tax profit from the treasury operation rose to Pounds 145m, from Pounds
100m. Profits from Scottish Mutual, the life assurance arm which deals
through independent financial advisers, and from Abbey National Life, whose
products are sold only through Abbey branches and which became operational
in February 1993, rose to Pounds 61m (Pounds 39m).
The group's continental European and offshore operations incurred a pre-tax
loss of Pounds 105m, compared with a loss of Pounds 46m in 1992, largely
because of the steep increase in provisions for commercial lending in
France.
Overall, provisions for the continental businesses jumped to Pounds 99m from
Pounds 47m, while those for UK operations fell from Pounds 227m to Pounds
119m. The sale in August of the group's Cornerstone estate agency chain
incurred an exceptional loss of Pounds 30m.
Net mortgage lending rose to Pounds 3.2bn in 1993, from Pounds 2.5bn,after
aggressive promotion of fixed rate mortgages. However, Mr Peter Birch, Abbey
chief executive, did not expect the group's 18.5 per cent share of the UK
mortgage market in 1993 to be repeated. It was likely to drop to its
previous 12-14 per cent range.
This year, Mr Birch expected a substantial increase in profits from the life
assurance businesses and a drop in provisions.
Further growth is also expected in the treasury operations, but the rate of
increase is thought unlikely to be as rapid as in the past two years. The
group did not intend to employ more than 35 per cent of its capital in this
area: currently its investment assets use 27 per cent of capital.
Abbey attracted Pounds 1.2bn retail savings, as it did in 1992, but because
the UK retail savings market has contracted, its market share rose to 7.8
per cent, against 5.1 per cent. Total assets rose 16 per cent to Pounds
83.8bn. The cost/income ratio remained at 44.5 per cent.
Mr Birch said the rise in operating costs from Pounds 706m to Pounds 763m
reflected payments made under its profit-sharing scheme; salary rises; and
modernising its 670 UK branches.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Salomon to advise on UK debt sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK Treasury has appointed Salomon Brothers International to advise on
disposals of its remaining holdings of debt in privatised UK companies in
the next financial year.
It is the first time that Salomon Brothers has been awarded a senior role by
the UK Treasury since it was ditched from the BT2 privatisation, after being
involved in a US Treasury auction scandal in 1991.
The Treasury said it had taken the unusual step of appointing a non-UK bank
because Salomon 'gave us the best presentation'.
The Treasury sold Pounds 1.3bn of similar debt in 1992 through a complex
auction, arranged by Barings, in which 13 privatised companies were invited
to bid to buy back their debt. Outside investors were allowed to compete for
BT debt.
The government still holds a total of Pounds 2.86bn of the debt - Pounds
1.22bn of BT debt and Pounds 1.64bn of electricity debt - which was left on
the companies' balance sheets at the time of privatisation. However, some of
that debt is very short-dated and unlikely to be sold.
Salomon will advise the Treasury on which and how much debt to sell, and how
to sell it.
The government aims to raise Pounds 5.5bn in privatisation proceeds in the
next financial year. The debt sale will allow greater leeway in the timing
of further electricity offerings.
However, one difficulty in selling the debt is that, with coupons of more
than 12 per cent - much higher than current market yields - it would have to
be priced at a premium of around 30 per cent above its notional value, which
could make it unattractive to potential buyers.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Currency: the risk that can appear benign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Mr George Soros can get a currency exposure wrong to the tune of Dollars
600m, as he has admitted to have done on February 14, should the average
portfolio manager be getting involved with the active management of foreign
exchange positions?
There is an odd contrast here between US and British pension funds. The
Americans are increasingly drawn to the separate management of foreign
exchange exposures - on some estimates a quarter of US pension funds are
already using so-called currency overlays. British pension funds, in
contrast, are inclined to leave investments in foreign currency securities
unhedged, except in unusual circumstances.
The feeling that dealing in securities counts as investment but trading in
currencies is speculation is deeply ingrained. It is reinforced in the UK by
the risk that currency gains unrelated to holdings of securities might be
taxed as profits from trading.
There is a theoretical reason, too, why currency exposure is different.
Whereas investment in, say, bonds carries a particular level of expected
return (and an investment in equities brings the reward of a rather higher
return, because of the risk premium) the expected return from holding
currencies is zero. A currency index fund will give no return over extended
periods. Although some currencies have proved to be consistently strong and
others consistently weak over the long term, these shifts have been offset
by interest rate differentials.
This does not mean, of course, that currency trading can never be
profitable. That may happen when central banks are intervening, as happened
in summer 1992. But although Soros made big gains then, he has found it much
trickier in freely floating conditions and, in the recent politically
volatile circumstances of the dollar and the yen.
Over short periods, investment returns on securities have a substantial
currency element, as much as 40 per cent of the annual returns in dollar
terms. Therefore a hedging strategy will be attractive if it reduces
volatility.
US pension funds are sensitive to short-term volatility because their
corporate sponsors are more directly subject to market-related valuations.
There is also a particular problem with the dollar: a volatile currency
which tends to move in a similar direction against most other currencies at
any particular time, whereas sterling often tracks a more moderate course
between the dollar and other European currencies such as the D-Mark.
A further structural factor is that US plan sponsors are used to layers of
specialist managers. Currency managers can easily be added on. In the UK,
however, balanced managers remain dominant. Trustees are inclined to leave
all decisions to them, including currencies. But the currency decisions are
not usually very well handled. Most British fund managers have been very
bullish of the dollar throughout the past year, for instance, to no avail.
British managers are focused on equities, where the assumption has been that
local market returns are inversely related to the strength of the currency:
devaluation, for instance, boosts share prices. Hedging is therefore less
important, especially from the perspective of a sterling investor, who is
accustomed to regular currency gains in his portfolio returns.
Things look different to a bond manager. Currency returns are more easily
divorced from domestic bond returns and separate management of the currency
and interest rate risks is more naturally embraced. True, the returns tend
to be positively correlated: weak currencies encourage fears of inflation
and undermine domestic bond prices. But this is not universally true: bond
prices, for instance, soared in the devaluing European countries after
September 1992 because the danger of soaring fiscal deficits was seen to be
reduced.
It is slightly strange that UK funds, which have an overseas exposure of
some 30 per cent, are less worried about currency risks than US funds, with
an exposure which may be about 6 per cent on average at present (albeit
rising).
But the currency impact on UK funds, most notably in late 1992, has been
perceived as benign. It will probably take a shock, in terms of large,
avoidable currency losses, to trigger UK pension fund trustees into action.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Croats and Moslems sign pact: Bosnian Serbs agree to open
Tuzla airport for relief flights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bosnian Moslems and Croats reached agreement last night after four days of
talks in Washington on plans for a loose federation of the two ethnic groups
in the war-torn republic.
The breakthrough came on the same day as Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian
foreign minister, managed to persuade Mr Radovan Karadzic, leader of the
Bosnian Serbs who is on a visit to Moscow, to allow Tuzla airport to be
placed under UN supervision, making it easier to transport aid.
In Washington, the Bosnian Moslem-Croat federation was established in a
framework deal, which included an outline agreement for a confederation
between it and neighbouring Croatia.
The accord, signed by Mr Mate Granic, the Croatian foreign minister, Mr
Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian prime minister, and Mr Kresimir Zubak, leader
of the Bosnian Croats, creates a federation of cantons with a central
government responsible for foreign affairs, national defence and commerce.
The president and vice-president will be elected by a two-house legislature
with the two ethnic groups alternating yearly in holding the positions.
The cantons will have authority over police, education, culture, housing,
public services and radio and television. All refugees and displaced people
will be guaranteed the right to return to their homes or to be compensated.
A deadline of March 15 was set for drafting a constitution for the new state
and for completing work on the confederation.
While the accord - which leaves details such as military issues still to be
resolved - does not address the Serb-held areas of Bosnia, US officials hope
it will put further pressure on the Serbs to make peace.
The US has offered both carrot and stick to Croatia as an inducement to end
the fighting between Croats and Moslems in central Bosnia. While threatening
economic sanctions on Croatia, officials have also held out the hope of
loans from international financial institutions.
In Moscow, Mr Kozyrev hailed the agreement with Mr Karadzic as a 'big step'
in a Russian peace initiative launched when President Boris Yeltsin
persuaded the Serbs to heed the Nato ultimatum for pulling back heavy
artillery from around Sarajevo.
After the accord, Russia said: 'This position of the Bosnian Serbs is based
on the fact that Russian observers will take part in monitoring the
non-military use of (Tuzla) airport.'
However, Mr Karadzic admitted the talks had been difficult.
The momentum for peace is being reflected on the ground, although with
varying degrees of success. Yesterday the International Red Cross secured
the release of 400 prisoners in the western city of Mostar, which had been
besieged by Croats for several months.
The UN High Commissioner for Refugees also resumed aid convoys and
humanitarian flights into the Bosnian capital Sarajevo.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Criticism of Whitehall reforms tests ministerial sang-froid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr William Waldegrave, the public service minister, was yesterday required
to dig deep into the lexicon of Whitehall-speak as he published a critical
report on the government's civil service reforms.
The report, commissioned by Mr Waldegrave himself, says the creation of
agencies to deliver government services has led to fragmentation of the
civil service. And it accuses Whitehall departments of interfering
excessively in the day-to-day management of agencies.
Mr Waldegrave described the report as 'useful and challenging', code among
the mandarins for 'embarrassing and very inconvenient'.
The author of the report was Ms Sylvie Trosa, a senior French civil servant
seconded to the Cabinet Office to evaluate the reforms. Ms Trosa previously
worked in the government office responsible for public service reform in
France.
She appears to have endorsed the central policy in the reforms, the creation
of more than 80 executive agencies to deliver services such as the payment
of benefits and vehicle licensing.
But she found confusion in the relationship between agencies and their
parent departments. Agency chiefs continue to complain of interference by
civil servants in Whitehall. 'There is a whole bureaucracy set up to monitor
us,' one agency chief executive told Ms Trosa.
Civil servants in central departments are also critical of the agencies, she
found, seeing agencies as increasingly drifting away from them in values and
culture. Attempts to ensure that staff move between agencies and departments
are 'minimal', according to Ms Trosa.
Ministers need to do much more to encourage cohesion in the civil service,
she added.
The report is based on interviews with senior civil servants, including the
chief executives of 26 agencies, half of whom came from outside the civil
service.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Bank of Japan expects gentle pick-up in domestic economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Japan could be near the bottom of its protracted recession, the country's
central bank said yesterday in its latest quarterly survey of business
conditions.
Business confidence has stopped weakening and the climate is expected to
improve, the Bank of Japan said in its February survey of more than 10,000
companies.
The Tankan index of manufacturers' confidence stagnated at minus 56, the
same as in the previous survey in November, staying at the lowest point in
the downturn since May 1991. The index, which gives the percentage balance
between companies reporting favourable and poor conditions, is forecast to
recover slightly to minus 50 by June.
A 'gentle' economic recovery is expected some time during the fiscal year
starting next month, said Mr Kagehide Kaku, the bank's head of research and
statistics. The Tankan survey is the most authoritative gauge of the
short-term business outlook and an important influence on monetary policy.
But several private sector economists feared the central bank was
optimistic, and said a cut in official discount rates, widely expected, was
needed to stimulate spending and investment.
If US president Bill Clinton succumbs to pressure for trade sanctions
against Japan, the consequent rise in the yen would delay recovery
prospects, they warned. The yen stood at about Y109 to the dollar when the
survey was taken, against Y104 at which it has traded in recent days.
'Japan's economy is brain-dead. There is no pulse, but at least that is
better than seeing the readings fall lower,' said Mr Kenneth Courtis, senior
economist at Deutsche Bank Capital Markets Asia.
Conditions have worsened for small manufacturers - usually an early warning
of changes in trend - where the index fell from minus 45 to minus 48. The
balance of manufacturers reporting excess capacity rose from 32 to 35 while
those with surplus staff rose from 26 to 28.
There were some encouraging signs in the survey, the Bank of Japan said, but
not enough to amount to clear evidence of the recovery. Large manufacturers,
outside the oil industry, expect pre-tax profits to fall 29.7 per cent in
the current fiscal year, the fourth year of profits decline, but to recover
by 11.4 per cent in 1994.
Japan's suspected credit squeeze may also be easing, on the strength of an
increase in the balance of companies to report that banks were being helpful
in their credit stance.

FT  02 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: GKN/Westland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Westland's defence document is notably short on pictures of burning bridges.
Perhaps that is because GKN will hold 45 per cent of Westland's shares even
if the bid fails completely. So whatever the outcome, the two companies will
have to live together. Yet while Westland avoided rough and tumble, it did
not cede much to GKN either. The gentlemanly nature of the campaign may not
be sustainable if both sides become entrenched.
Westland's defence rests firmly on prospects for EH101 orders and the
possibility that the Apache will become the next British Army attack
helicopter. Veterans of the 1985-86 capital reconstruction will remember
that large claims were made for the Black Hawk, and the orders never
materialised. Still, while there are risks in relying on projections to the
year 2000, Westland's new management has a good track record. Loyal
shareholders may wonder why, having waited so long, they should grab a bird
in the hand now when there could be more than two in the bush. There is a
case for supporting Westland, at least until it fails to meet its
projections.
GKN's best point is that it could bolster Westland's strong but small
balance sheet. Customer stage payments should cover Westland's working
capital needs, but there is little margin for error. With Westland's shares
15 per cent above the offer, the market clearly thinks GKN is going to have
to pay substantially more for victory. Whether GKN is prepared to raise its
offer and its gearing enough is another question.

FT  02 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Abbey National
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Had Abbey National been determined to stick to its previous target of three
times for dividend cover, its payment might not have increased at all this
year. As it is, the 22 per cent increase, which is broadly in line with
earnings growth, is a welcome admission that it has enough capital to be
going on with and does not need to retain every last penny of earnings. The
desire to avoid building up surplus capital is perhaps a signal that the
bank is more interested in boosting return than in further expensive
attempts at diversification for its own sake. That is also good news after
its embarrassing excursions into estate agency and French commercial
lending.
Yet Abbey's dividend cover of just 2.1 times is at the bottom of its new
target range of two to three times. That is in line with other banks that
have also paid large dividend increases, but it suggests something of a
struggle to reach the top of the target range by the peak of the cycle.
Special factors, including a lower tax rate, will boost earnings this year.
Continental provisions should fall sharply and the cost of getting out of
estate agency will not be repeated. Less certain are the prospects for
operating profit. Abbey expects the contribution from insurance to increase
substantially. But mortgage margins may narrow as interest rates stop
falling, and treasury profits will grow more slowly. Abbey's dividend
increase looks like a one-step jump, even though low inflation reduces the
need for cover.

FT  02 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: General Accident
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is curious that General Accident's shares should rise against the trend
of a market led lower by US bonds. True, full year profits were at the
higher end of market expectations. But with almost half its assets in North
America, GA is unusually geared to US treasuries. Jitters in world bond
markets have shaved 2 percentage points from the group's solvency margin
since the year end. With solvency comfortably over 50 per cent, GA is hardly
starved of capital. Yet a dividend equivalent to 5 per cent of shareholders'
funds and covered only 1.8 times by earnings is a heavy burden. Should the
bear market in bonds take hold, GA might find it difficult to increase the
pay-out as fast as shareholders would like.
That is all the more reason to hope that the earnings recovery continues.
There should be more to come in the UK as premium increases already
announced flow through into profits. GA's willingness to turn away motorists
also suggests some sincerity about underwriting for profit at the expense of
market share. Yet the bigger challenge now lies in the US and Canada, where
underwriting losses amounted to Pounds 188m last year. The US in particular
will be a tough nut to crack since GA lacks sufficient weight to influence
market rates.
Without a rise in insurance rates across the US market, GA can only increase
premiums unilaterally even if that means losing business. Whether that will
be enough to bring about decent profits remains an open question. The 20 per
cent premium to net asset value at which the shares now stand demands no
less.

FT  02 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Yielding to pressure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The US Treasury bond market, which has been scaring itself with inflationary
phantoms ever since the Federal Reserve tugged on the monetary reins last
month, has spooked itself some more. Revised figures suggesting the US
economy grew at an annualised rate of 7.5 per cent in the fourth quarter of
1993 were eye-catching but somewhat academic. The hand of God, which has
administered earthquakes and snowfalls, will have slowed that breakneck
expansion this quarter. Bond traders were more alarmed by the latest
purchasing managers' price index, which showed a second consecutive monthly
rise.
Such figures emphasise how quickly disinflationary pressures are abating but
they do not yet confirm that an inflationary trend has asserted itself in
the real economy. The purchasing managers' index can be an unreliable
predictor of consumer price inflation. The rise in some commodity prices
will be partly offset by the continued weakness of oil. Consumer confidence
and employment levels remain weak. The bond market may therefore be
over-reacting to inflation fears but may still be right to anticipate a
further monetary tightening.
European bond markets are being buffeted by the US turbulence even though
yesterday's developments strengthen the argument for a decoupling. The
output gap in many European economies will widen this year, creating scope
for further interest rates falls. But it would help if the Bundesbank had
been bolder in cutting its money market repurchase rate by more than 3 basis
points.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Leading Article: The Scott inquisition
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's Conservatives are nervous. They rightly fear the outcome of Lord
Justice Scott's inquiry into the sale to Iraq of equipment that could make
armaments. The affair has an uncomfortable feel to it, bringing on
forebodings of the disquieting effects of a long period in office. There are
unhappy parallels. Italy's Christian Democrats were suspected of links with
organised crime. Japan's Liberal Democrats fell into disrepute because,
after a period in which they seemed destined to rule forever, they became
complacent and corrupt.
Now the spotlight is on Westminster. The charges laid against certain
ministers and officials are peculiarly British. None of them is accused of
seeking financial advantage. Yet if the gathering storm does break it could
be more damaging to Mr John Major's administration than other recent
scandals and resignations. The reputations of leading Tories, not excluding
the prime minister himself, are at issue. Some have promised to resign if
found to have acted improperly. The essence of the indictment against them
is that, in the absence of a written constitution, they have been guilty of
the unthinking misuse of power.
Ministerial connivance
The first charge relates to 'public interest immunity' (PII) certificates,
which invite judges to excuse the presentation of named documents in court.
PIIs were signed by five Conservative ministers to protect papers demanded
at the Matrix Churchill trial. Executives of the company were accused of
evading restrictions on exports. Yet ministries, and the security services,
were aware of what Matrix Churchill was doing, and connived at it. The trial
judge did not accept the PIIs. The defendants were released. Other judges
might have acted otherwise. It looks, despite protestations to the contrary,
as if Whitehall might have allowed the accused to be jailed in the interest
of protecting certain documents, although many of them were not likely to
damage the public interest. They were merely embarrassing.
Faced with this, ministerial witnesses have told different stories. The
defence secretary said he was obliged to sign the PIIs; the chancellor that
he had a degree of discretion; the social security secretary that he doubted
that the defendants would be found guilty. On Monday the trade secretary, Mr
Michael Heseltine, said that he at first declined to sign, but agreed after
the wording was amended. He stated that the attorney general, Sir Nicholas
Lyell, had advised him that he must do so, but had given contradictory
advice in a subsequent case. Sir Nicholas said afterwards that his advice
had been consistent. It is rare for two senior members of the same
government to be in such open conflict.
Altered guidelines
The second charge is that while Lady Thatcher was in office the government
secretly altered the export guidelines in Iraq's favour, but hid this from
parliament. It was in relation to this accusation that Sir Robin Butler,
Britain's most senior civil servant, made his celebrated remarks about the
necessity for governments to divide the truth into fractions, only some of
which need be revealed. To outsiders, this seemed like Whitehall taking its
omniscience more seriously than its competence might justify.
The inquiry has now run for nine months. Many distinguished witnesses have
given evidence, including Mr Major, Lady Thatcher, other colleagues, and
many officials. All are well able to look after themselves. None requires
the protection of professional advocacy as suggested by Lord Howe, a former
foreign secretary and chancellor. Yet the view that heads must roll is
gathering force. Sir Nicholas is the current favourite candidate for the
tumbrils. Before deciding his future he will have his say at the inquiry.
Unless he is unconvincing then, he should await Lord Justice Scott's report.
The judge cannot design a constitution for Britain, but he can call for a
clear statement of published rules, perhaps involving some external form of
appeal. Depending on his findings, a judgment will have to be made whether a
change of rules, plus the possible sacrifice of one attorney general's
career, is a sufficient response.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Bigger burden for a stronger man: India is taking a
calculated gamble on growth to offset undemanding borrowing targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
India this week altered course on the road to economic reform, abandoning
the tough fiscal path it has tried to follow for the past three years, in
favour of gradual structural change combined with acceptance of large fiscal
deficits.
While the aim of increasing growth through economic liberalisation remains
the same, Mr Manmohan Singh, the scholarly finance minister, signalled in
Monday's budget that he and Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, prefer
to bypass difficulties rather than confront them. They may get away with it
for a while but they could be storing up problems for the future.
The two have chosen to tolerate a higher level of public borrowing than they
deemed acceptable even a year ago. They have tacitly admitted that the
government, with its vast web of bureaucracy and state-owned industry, its
coils of patronage, its subsidies and corruption is too big an animal to be
tamed quickly.
They are gambling that the measures already taken since they embarked on
reform in mid-1991 will be enough to create space for domestic enterprise to
grow and prosper. If they are right, then India will have shown the world
how to restructure a socialist-style economy with a minimum of dislocation.
If they are wrong, they risk sending the country back down a vicious circle
of mounting debt, rising inflation and declining growth.
It is possible for Mr Rao and Mr Singh to succeed: there is growing
confidence in India among domestic and foreign businessmen; foreign exchange
reserves are at record levels; and after six good harvests in succession,
farmers are content. But the decision to take a relaxed attitude to public
borrowing will make the country more vulnerable to external shocks such as a
jump in world interest rates or oil prices, or a bad monsoon. Any of these
could spark a surge in inflation, which is already uncomfortably high,
running at 8.2 per cent a year after a recent low of 7 per cent. And no
Indian government can tolerate high inflation for long, given the
devastating effects of rising prices on the poor.
Mr Singh presented his budget as a calculated economic risk. The truth is
that the calculation is as much political as economic. The ruling Congress
(I) party faces several state elections over the next year, culminating in a
general election which must be held by mid-1996 but could be held earlier if
the prime minister wishes. A tough budget risked losing votes. As Mr Tapan
Dasgupta, a leading economic commentator, says: 'This budget is the
political price for doing reform in a democracy.'
Over the past year, there have been many indications that the government was
relaxing curbs on borrowing - the religious unrest which followed the
sacking of the Ayodhya mosque in December 1992 brought unexpected policing
bills; it also hit trade, reducing customs and indirect tax revenues.
Nevertheless, Monday's public borrowing figures came as a surprise. Mr Singh
disclosed the fiscal deficit for the year ending March 1994 would reach 7.3
per cent of gross domestic product - compared with a target of 4.7 per cent.
Moreover, the finance minister set an undemanding target of 6 per cent for
the 1994-95 financial year.
The government is further distancing itself from the aim it espoused in 1991
of cutting public spending in order to free resources for private
enterprise. These cuts were a condition of the emergency loan India secured
from the International Monetary Fund in order to stave off default in a
balance of payments crisis. In practice, the government reduced the fiscal
deficit greatly only in the first year after getting the loan from 8.4 per
cent to 5.9 per cent of GDP - and the deficit has been creeping up ever
since.
Mr Singh is now trying a different tack - he hopes that the economy will
grow, so the size of public borrowing in proportion to the economy will
shrink, even if it does not fall in absolute terms. The stone will be as
large as it was, but the man carrying it will be stronger.
To help stimulate growth, Mr Singh has included in his budget more measures
designed to mobilise the resources of private enterprise - and to encourage
businesses to become more competitive with foreign companies. Deregulation
remains a central feature of government policy. As in previous years,
customs duties are being cut - from a peak rate of 85 per cent to 65 per
cent. Duties on capital goods and materials, including steel, are being
reduced sharply to encourage industry to invest in world-class plants.
Indirect taxes are being pruned to reduce their complexity and generate more
competition. Corporate tax rates are coming down - as is the income tax
burden on consumers, to help boost demand.
Industrialists hailed the budget for its emphasis on growth. 'It's a great
budget for industry,' said Mr Tarun Das, secretary-general of the
Confederation of Indian Industry, the employers' body.
Mr Singh has some good reasons for feeling positive about achieving his
target of increasing growth from an estimated 4 per cent this year to 5-6
per cent in 1994-95. After almost three years of slowdown induced by the
1991 financial crisis, industry is staging a belated revival. Industrial
output rose only 1.6 per cent in the first half of 1993-94, weighed down by
the weak performance of heavy engineering and other sectors dependent on
government orders such as telecommunications. But consumer goods companies,
including vehicle and electronics manufacturers, are making significant
advances in output. Exports soared 21 per cent in the 10 months to the end
of January.
Moreover, India is attracting record amounts of foreign capital. An
estimated Dollars 3bn will flow into the country in the year to the end of
March 1993 - up from Dollars 585m in 1992-93. The total includes direct
investment, foreign portfolio investment and overseas capital issues by
Indian companies. These inflows have given India a good cushion against
external shocks - Dollars 13bn in foreign exchange reserves, enough for more
than six months of imports. 'It is these reserves which have allowed Mr
Singh to present the budget that he has,' says Mr S L Rao, director of the
NCAER, an independent economics think-tank.
However the government's hopes could still be dashed if it neglects either
its own housekeeping or reform. The most immediate concern is that public
borrowing could rise further. 'Borrowing is out of control,' says Mr
Dasgupta, 'How can those who have let it go bring it back under control?'
The pressures for wasteful spending - for subsidies and hand-outs - will
increase the closer the government gets to a general election.
A more radical approach would have been to step up and extend the
half-hearted privatisation programme. India has gone some way towards
forcing a shake-up of its private sector by exposing it to foreign
competition. But the government has baulked at a similar transformation of
the public sector. It is, at least, selling shares in profitable state-owned
enterprises, including the State Bank of India, the largest commercial bank,
and the national oil corporations. But sales are expected to be a mere
Rs25bn (Dollars 797m) in 1992-93 and perhaps Rs40bn next year. Mr Rao, of
the NCAER, says the buoyant stock market could absorb Rs300bn a year. 'So
much more could be done with privatisation. It might produce demonstrations
in the streets. But so what? The government is too cautious.'
Similarly, there is little indication in the budget that the government will
tackle another sacred cow of pre-1991 India - a virtual ban on compulsory
redundancy, which many potential foreign investors see as an obstacle.
Mr Manmohan Singh and his colleagues deny that they are going slow on
reform. They point to the many useful measures in the budget and to other
non-budget measures in the pipeline such as liberalisation of the insurance
industry and of telecommunications.
But it is difficult to avoid the impression that they are now making
progress largely in directions which do not require much blood, sweat or
tears. As Mr Rao, of the NCAER says: 'In restructuring, there's no gain
without pain. This government seems to believe differently.'

FT  02 MAR 94 / Personal View: Why UK suffers from lack of investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the UK economy embarks on its second year of 'recovery', a critical issue
is how much potential slack there is in the system. Giles Keating (Letters:
'No evidence of narrowing output gap', February 16) correctly points out
that the total rise in employment last year was more than accounted for by
an increase in part-timers and self-employed and, therefore, 'the total
number of hours of labour services used by the economy hasn't risen much
during the recovery and may well have continued to fall'.
In itself, 'this is not evidence of a narrowing output gap', but a full
answer to the question requires an appreciation of what is happening to the
utilisation of plant and machinery, as well as labour.
The CBI industrial trends survey suggests the overall position is hotting up
in manufacturing. The proportion of companies reporting their present level
of output as 'below capacity' has fallen from 73 per cent to 57 per cent
over the last year. The CBI research shows that, when companies respond to
this question, they take account of labour and plant capacity. If labour is
not a problem, yet companies report an increase in capacity utilisation, the
implication is that the position with respect to plant capacity is tighter
than appears from the overall measure.
This picture is confirmed by responses to another question in the survey:
'What factors are likely to limit your output over the next four months?'
Responses to the 'skilled labour' and 'other labour' categories have
remained flat at a very low level over the last year. Response to the 'plant
capacity' category has more than doubled and is back to its 1970s cyclical
peak.
The survey shows that, prior to the 1980s, a shortage of labour was the
effective constraint on the economy. Now the problem is available plant and
machinery, at least at current investment rates. This picture is for
manufacturing alone, which accounts for only one-quarter of national output.
But if there are some fundamental, economy-wide reasons why manufacturing is
'underinvesting' in this way, other areas of the economy may be similarly
afflicted.
An important explanation of why UK companies may be underinvesting was
highlighted by Professor Dimson and Professor Marsh (Management: 'Unhappy
returns', February 9). They suggest companies have yet to adjust to the
worldwide fall in cost of debt and equity capital. As a result, managements
are demanding an excessive return from new investment projects and 'there is
a real danger that these companies will underinvest'.
Dimson and Marsh suggest that a company's true overall cost of capital is
now in the region of 11-12 per cent (after tax), compared with the more
common assumption used by companies of about 20 per cent.
The critical issue is the appropriate risk premium to apply to the risk-free
rate of return required by the market. The risk-free rate can be
approximated by the yield to maturity on government debt. The conventional
way of measuring the risk premium is simply to take the extent to which
equities have outperformed government bonds over some historic period. On
this basis, Dimson and Marsh produce 8 per cent for the risk premium, or 6-7
per cent adjusting for the fact that a company's shares are more risky than
its underlying assets. However, the historic outperformance of equities will
only be a good indicator of what the market requires from them if investors
more or less correctly anticipated events.
The biggest mistake the market has made in recent history has been to
underestimate inflation. Hence, the total real return on long-dated gilts
issued in the 1960s was zero or less. Equities, on the other hand, provide
more of a hedge against inflation through their ability to increase
dividends. Unanticipated inflation has generally pushed the outperformance
of equities compared with gilts above that required or expected by the
market.
In this case, the actual equity risk premium demanded by the market is
probably a lot less than the historic outperformance of equities and,
therefore, conventional practice will lead companies to assume too high a
cost of capital. Indeed, the only way to make sense of current equity
ratings is to assume a risk premium more like 2-4 per cent, in which case
the true cost of capital is more like 8-9 per cent, less than half the
common assumption.
The widespread overstatement of the cost of capital in business is reason
enough to explain why the UK economy generally - not just in manufacturing -
suffers from a lack of investment and is in grave danger of being left with
a high level of 'capital-shortage' unemployment.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Tackling the settler problem
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Middle East has taken important strides towards greater stability in the
past three years and it would be criminal folly to permit the act of one
extremist to undo much of what has been achieved. The peace negotiations
between Israel, the Palestinians, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan must continue
despite the massacre at a mosque in Hebron last Friday.
But it would be politically naive to suppose that the Arabs, and
particularly the Palestinians, can agree to a resumption of negotiations
while passions in the Israeli-occupied territories are so inflamed. A
measure of calm has to be restored, and some confidence instilled that there
will be less risk of similar acts of barbarism in the future.
The greatest part of that responsibility lies with the government of Israel.
Successive Israeli governments have permitted or vigorously encouraged
Jewish settlers to establish themselves in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and
Golan Heights, against the terms of the Geneva Convention and despite the
condemnation of the world community, including the US. All recent incumbents
of the White House have emphasised that they consider the settlements to be
an obstacle to peace.
They become even more of an obstacle when provocatively placed in the heart
of, or very close to, substantial Palestinian population centres. Baruch
Goldstein, who carried out the Hebron massacre, lived in such a settlement
along with other fanatics whose declared aim is to sabotage the peace
process.
Too modest
The measures announced by the government against a handful of settlers since
the massacre seem far too modest to ensure a significant improvement in
security for Palestinians. Less than 100 people have been banned from
carrying weapons under new government restrictions. Other armed settlers,
many of whom are army reservists, are still free to walk the streets of
Hebron and other Palestinian towns. The risk of another Goldstein being
among them cannot be ignored.
The best way of reducing that danger is for the government immediately to
order the closure of those few settlements sited in the most sensitive areas
of Palestinian population, and to bar settlers from carrying arms outside
their own settlement areas. Responsibility for their security must rest with
the Israeli army, just as it does for the Palestinian population.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, has so far set his face against such
measures, but they would not lack support among an important part of the
electorate, and among some of his cabinet colleagues. Neither need the
closure of a few settlements prejudge negotiations on the wider settlement
issue, which, under the Washington agreement signed with the Palestinians on
September 13, are scheduled to begin two years after the introduction of
limited Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza.
Act decisively
Mr Rabin, though cautious by nature, has shown in the past that he can act
decisively when faced by security threats. At the end of 1992 he expelled
415 Palestinians to south Lebanon, and in July he launched a week-long
bombardment of southern Lebanon which cost an estimated 125 lives and drove
some 250,000 people from their homes. He might reflect that extremists from
within his own community can now be seen as every bit as much a threat to
the peace process as those from the Arab community.
The Palestine Liberation Organisation should equally be careful to maintain
a balance in its own reaction to the tragedy. Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO
chairman, is justly concerned that security for Palestinians in the
territories be improved, and the presence of UN observers, as agreed in the
Washington accords, would be a useful step. But any attempt at this stage to
force a more fundamental reassessment of those agreements would almost
certainly be counter-productive.
The longer-term political survival of both Mr Arafat and Mr Rabin is closely
linked with their ability to conclude a successful peace accord. In the
short term that will be best served by Israel taking a tighter grip on its
extremists, and by the two sides completing their negotiations on an Israeli
troop withdrawal from much of Gaza and the West Bank.

At last Fisons gets a new finance director. Tipped as a takeover play since
a profits warning in December - coinciding with the early retirement of

 -Fisons has nominated David Hankinson as finance chappie.
He's been around a bit - Fisons will be his seventh job in 15 years - and
tends to end up at companies which have a record of attracting the

at Ranks Hovis McDougall when it was taken over by Tomkins a year ago.
Still, Fisons' shares moved not a jot yesterday, so perhaps the waters have

A triumph for German unification. Forget the negative talk about soaring
unemployment and chronic shortages of kindergarten places; disgruntled
easterners who believe nothing has been preserved of their once prized
communist state have something to boast about at last.
Germany's reunited transport ministry has decided that motorists in the west
will now be allowed to take advantage of a traffic regulation once found
only across the border. All of Germany's drivers will now be allowed to turn
right at a red traffic light, provided the road is clear.
'Experience in the new federal states (that is, east Germany) shows that the
new regulation can contribute in certain circumstances to the alleviation of
the traffic situation,' a ministry circular intones.
If that's all the poor Ossis feel is left of their old world, no wonder the
shine has started to rub off the commemorative unification coins.

A hint of uncertainty hangs over the next clutch of appointments at the Bank
of England. The Court of Governors has three vacancies, following the expiry
of the terms of Warburg's Sir David Scholey, Sir Adrian Cadbury, and Gavin
Laird, general secretary of the AEEU engineering union.
Sir Adrian says he's had enough after 24 years; Sir David has just been made
a governor of the BBC, so probably won't mind if he's not reappointed. But
the trade union lobby is getting itself in a tizzy about who will replace
Laird.
Since the Bank was nationalised in 1946, it's been a convention to have a
trade union leader as a non-executive director. Laird was appointed in 1986
by Margaret Thatcher, no less. Given the TUC's efforts to enter the modern
world, surely the government will not refuse it a job for one of its boys?

FT  02 MAR 94 / Observer: Jaffre in good Elf
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If Baroness Thatcher were to admit to having French business heroes, then
Elf Aquitaine boss Philippe Jaffre might well top the list.
His stubbornness in attempting to reverse a sharp fall in profits evinces a
powerful degree of Thatcherite brinkmanship. Nor is he chary of tough
decisions, even if they precipitate a diplomatic incident.
A case in point has followed his latest act, that of reducing the newly
privatised French oil giant's stake in a showpiece refinery in eastern
Germany. It's provoked a protest letter from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to
Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister.
But Jaffre is a shrewd negotiator, whose rigorous view of profitability was
refined during a rapid rise through France's banking system, culminating in
the chairmanship of Credit Agricole, the country's biggest bank.
On job cuts, however, he takes a less Thatcherite line. Jaffre rejects what
he describes as the 'Anglo-Saxon' method of drastic staff reductions, which
have been employed at rival oil companies. Instead he talks of continual
change and the need to maintain morale. If unemployment results from the
eastern German move, it won't be Elf that loses out.
Charity begins at home; a Thatcherite virtue if ever there was one.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Transatlantic row over a sacred cow: A milk-boosting hormone
is causing controversy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE and ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week, US supermarkets received the first deliveries of milk produced by
cows which had undergone a new form of hormone treatment that greatly
stimulates milk production.
The hormone, known as bovine somatotrophin (BST) and developed by Monsanto
and other chemical companies at a cost approaching Dollars 1bn, is a
manufactured version of a naturally occurring hormone. Marketed under the
name Posilac, it has been hailed as an important advance in bio-engineering.
According to the US Food and Drug Administration, milk and meat from cows
who have been treated with it are safe and virtually indistinguishable from
the normal product.
But these benefits have not prevented BST being swept up in a storm of
controversy in the US as well as the European Union, where a ban on its use
must be reviewed later this year. Fears about the hormone centre not just on
the possible health effects, but also on the damage that a sudden surge in
milk production could do to the subsidy-laden agricultural economies of
Europe and North America.
Use of the hormone in the US was finally approved last November after
decades of study and debate. At the same time the White House ordered a
study of the potential impact on a market already struggling with milk
surpluses. This showed that BST could boost US milk production by 1 per cent
a year over the next six years. Unless BST triggered a big change in milk
consumption patterns, the US government would be obliged by its dairy
support programme to buy up almost all of the additional production at a
cost over five years of more than Dollars 500m, an increase of 40 per cent
in its annual dairy outlays.
Although farmers who are quickest to use the drug would enjoy a short-term
profit boost, the study suggests that, as a result of larger and fewer dairy
farms and increasing rural depopulation, the net economic effect over five
years would be to reduce farm income by 1 per cent and shrink dairy herds by
up to 30 per cent. Nor would the consumer benefit, because the subsidy
payments would ensure that the retail price did not fall noticeably.
Resistance to BST has been building up for some time. Consumer and farm
groups, led by Washington-based activist Jeremy Rifkin who heads the Pure
Food Campaign, have staged protests and milk dumpings throughout the US. Ms
Robin Douthitt, professor of consumer science at the University of
Wisconsin, says that, while other bio-tech projects aim to produce a better
tomato or a tastier potato, BST-treated milk brings no benefit to consumers;
and because BST-treated milk is perceived as unnatural, it is seen as adding
risk to a product generally considered as pure.
Fearing a consumer backlash, nearly 200 US food companies, including large
grocery and convenience store chains and 14 dairy co-operatives, have asked
their suppliers not to deliver hormone-enhanced milk for three months to
give them a chance to assess the market impact. In the two top dairy states,
Wisconsin and California, six school districts have asked that milk
delivered to their cafeterias come from untreated cows.
However, consumers have few ways of ensuring that the milk they receive is
from BST-free herds, and the US government, keen to support biotechnology,
is making it difficult for processors to label their milk free of artificial
hormone treatments by requiring them to prove their claims with detailed
documentation. Monsanto is also suing two small dairy processors for using a
BST-free label and has sent warning letters to others.
The launch of BST in the US raises doubts about whether the European
Commission can continue to resist its use in Europe, where it is the subject
of a four-year-old moratorium. Its use could also erupt into a transatlantic
trade dispute, highlighting the potential clash between the ethics of food
production and the pressure for unrestricted commerce under the new General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
'The European Union emphasises quality, wholesome products rather than
quantity,' said a Commission official. 'We're stronger on that than the US.
The US tends to be more geared to market forces, competitiveness, economies
of scale and technological innovation.'
Brussels has no quarrel with the safety of BST for human consumption, but it
is concerned about its use on environmental and economic grounds. It
believes that consumers would see dairy products from cows injected with BST
as adulterated and would respond by cutting down on all milk products. A
German survey showed that dairy consumption would drop by 11 per cent if BST
were introduced.
Mr Steve Emmott of BST Concern, a UK campaign representing farmers,
environmentalists and animal welfare groups, says: 'This is the first
flagship of the biotechnology industry coming to the market. But we don't
think BST is a useful way of using the technology . . . It's a product no
one wants or needs apart from the manufacturers. We don't need surplus milk.
And we don't need milk with genetically engineered hormones.'
Until recently, Mr Rene Steichen, the agriculture commissioner, indicated
that BST-produced dairy goods would not be allowed into the European Union
while the moratorium remained in force. But US officials say any such ban is
likely to be challenged, just as the US fought the EU's 1989 ban on imports
of US meat produced with growth hormones. US dairy exports to the EU amount
to only Dollars 45m a year. 'But it's an issue of principle,' said a US
official. In any case, the US will have greater access to the European
market for its dairy goods under the Gatt agreement.
The Gatt view is that an import ban would be difficult to justify, because
products may in future only be challenged on strictly scientific criteria as
opposed to social or ethical considerations.
However, the matter does not stop at an import ban. The White House report
suggests that the US might challenge any extension of the EU moratorium.
'For countries to ban BST use, after the hormone has been scientifically
found to be safe, would undermine efforts to eliminate unfair trade barriers
to US exports,' it says.
At the end of the year, farm ministers must decide the future of BST in
Europe. Last December, the Commission lost its battle to keep the moratorium
on BST in place until 2000. The ministers agreed only to extend it until the
end of this year, saying they wanted to monitor its impact in the US, the
trade implications and the effect on European competitiveness.
To strengthen its hand, the Commission has assembled a long list of
arguments against BST. It says that using the drug is not compatible with
Common Agricultural Policy reforms designed to reduce milk output, and is
likely to accelerate the trend towards bigger and fewer dairy farms and to
lead to more cows being slaughtered and more beef cattle raised instead,
adding to the beef mountain.
US officials counter that, if fewer cows are needed to produce a given
amount of milk, BST helps the environment by cutting manure and methane
production and the amount of water, land and chemicals used. They say a
small well-managed farm could benefit as much or more from BST use as a big,
poorly managed one.
However, the Commission is polishing up a new weapon in its armoury to keep
the moratorium going. It argues that guaranteeing its dairy products free of
BST could give the EU a competitive advantage over US exports - and even a
chance to charge a premium - in world markets where BST is either not used
or not appreciated such as in Japan.
'We didn't think of that,' admitted a senior US agriculture official
ruefully.

Sir, As a Swiss citizen I felt rather uncomfortable reading your article,
'EU up in arms over Alpine truck ban' (February 22). The Swiss people
decided in a democratic vote to ban trucks from travelling through the Swiss
Alps. That the EU now threatens Switzerland with retaliatory measures leaves
me with the impression that the EU does not respect a result of a democratic
decision.
This position will not make it easier for the new candidates (all rather
small countries) to join the EU since, under the Maastricht treaty,
decisions such as that taken in Switzerland would simply be overruled by an
institution with weak democratic foundations.
But different opinions are also held within the EU. The former environment
minister, Carlo Ripa di Meana, said he hoped this was 'not an isolated case
but a turn of the trend' in European transport policy.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: PIA must tackle causes notsymptoms of
bad practice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BEN GOH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is inevitable that there will always be those who oppose change.
Change can upset the status quo and threaten vested interests. The PIA's
birth pangs have hardly started yet. Speaking as a compliance practitioner,
the publication of the PIA's prospectus and how it intends to act as a
regulator marks a significant milestone in the PIA's quest for recognition
as the self-regulatory organisation by the SIB.
A major hurdle for the PIA to clear to gain credibility is how it proposes
to tackle the causes rather than treat the symptoms of bad practice. One of
the key issues is product bias, which a commission-based remuneration system
produces, particularly since Lautro's maximum commission rules have been
abolished. Product bias, if allowed to proliferate unchecked, threatens the
core on which financial services regulation is founded - treating the
client's interests as paramount even where there is a conflict of interest.
Given the choice, it will require a perfectly altruistic adviser or salesman
to recommend a product that earns him less commission but is more suitable
for the needs of the client. I suspect that in practice a 'smart' adviser or
salesman is likely to choose the product that will earn the highest
commission possible and proceed to make a convincing case for recommending
the product to the client.
If the PIA truly marks a new dawn, it must waste no time in tackling the
causes of bad practice that is highly damaging to the reputation of the
industry. If it can do this efficiently, then it should be able to face the
future with equanimity and confidence. The pangs and upheaval caused by its
birth would have been a price worth paying. Ben Goh,

FT  02 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Competition forces radical
restructuring at British Gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From CH BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article (Lex, February 25) misses one fundamental point. British
Gas has now lost 78 per cent of the firm contract market and, since August
1992, 33 per cent of the market between 2,500 and 25,000 therms.
In total this now represents a loss of 41 per cent of the market open for
competition, compared with a Monopolies and Mergers Commission target of 45
per cent.
Furthermore, the company is prevented from defending its position because
the playing field is artificially tilted against it. Finally, from 1996
onwards competition will be introduced to the rest of the market below 2,500
therms.
The company has taken firm management action by restructuring the business
to enable it to compete effectively in these significantly changed
circumstances. Clearly the market has changed dramatically and British Gas
has changed rapidly to adapt. It is disappointing that your article appears
to treat a serious situation so superficially.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Exec options that reward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID OGDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I have been following your recent reports on executive share options
and believe a central point has been overlooked: the benefits to companies
of this type of plan. Executive options can attract, retain, reward and
motivate key employees at no cost to the company's profit and loss account
and with no risk to the company or participant. The cash flow benefits of
options can be particularly important in smaller, growing companies that
need to reinvest cash. They can use options to attract high-calibre
executives who are prepared to take a lower salary and the chance of share
option gains.
Much of the recent criticism has been directed at the excesses of some
option plans, neglecting the suitability of well-designed plans with
allocation policies that have been given sufficient thought. Restricted
shares may be appropriate in some cases but they have to be paid for out of
profits and the gain is linked to the share price in the same way as an
option gain. If the share price falls, the participant will not lose money.
With an option, on the other hand, the share price has to rise for him to
gain.
If the company follows the guidelines of institutional investors, the
dilution effect of issuing new shares on the exercise of options is very
small - only 5 per cent of the company's share capital can be issued for
executive options granted over 10 years.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Heads in the sand: The UK's Conservatives should be
concentrating on Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secre-tary, sometimes claims that Britain is
'winning the argument' with its European partners over the future shape of
the European Union. It is not entirely clear how he reaches this conclusion.
What is clear is that most of the other broadly based Conservative parties
in Europe have signed up to a manifesto for this year's elections to the
European Parliament which is at odds with the beliefs of the UK Conservative
government.
Europe's Christian Democrats have issued a manifesto explicitly calling for
a federal Europe, including a single currency and a European constitution.
But even before it was published, Mr Hurd was busy assuring UK Conservatives
that their manifesto would be totally different, totally British and totally
non-federal.
This beautifully British manifesto is slow to appear. Not merely do the UK
Conservatives not agree with those who ought to be their natural partners
across the Channel, they do not agree with each other: it is not easy to
draft a text which straddles the deep gulf between the Europhobes and the
relative Europhiles. Inside sources say the compromise version will be
virtually devoid of content, because the party cannot agree a positive
policy position on Europe.
One can see the Conservatives' problem. They were bruised by the
interminable struggle over the ratification of the Maastricht treaty, and
they are in no hurry to grapple in public with those controversial issues
once more. And since they cannot fight the European Parliament election
campaign on an enthusiastically pro-European platform, they will try to
fight it on an enthusiastically anti-Socialist platform.
'We must avoid a debate about 'Europe - right or wrong',' says a party
intellectual. 'Therefore, we must engineer a debate about 'Europe - right or
left'.'
This will be a difficult trick to turn: the campaign is more likely to turn
on the unpopularity of the government at home than on any European issues.
But even if it succeeds, it might not be to the advantage of the
Conservatives.
The paradox is that Europe's Socialist parties once fiercely combated
European integration as a big business ramp. But they have come round to
thinking it may have something for them after all, in the form of
quasi-Socialist palliatives, such as the Social Chapter of the Maastricht
treaty, or a strengthening of democracy at the European level.
Most British Conservatives, by contrast, seem to have a deep aversion to the
Europe that is emerging, and are consequently unable to come up with a
creative approach to the opportunities it offers. This is a great pity. Not
because any great European issues will be decided by this year's election
campaign to the European Parliament, but because history is thundering down
on us, and the Conservatives will not be able to deal with it by averting
their eyes.
They want to forget all about the Maastricht treaty, and pull the bedclothes
over their ears. But in the 1996 review conference, which is less than two
years away, they will have to face all the Maastricht issues once more, and
by then the stakes will be much higher.
Take the plan for economic and monetary union. Mr John Major, UK prime
minister, says it is as illusory as a rain dance. But by the 1996 review
conference, it will be clear that a large central core of the Union is still
determined to go for a single currency; and it will not be deterred by the
reluctance of the also-rans. What will the Conservatives say then? They do
not know; they merely hope it cannot happen; but that's not a policy.
Or consider the Maastricht project for a common foreign and security policy
for Europe. The UK's Conservatives want to put brakes on it, in the belief
that they can hang on to the old familiar ingredients of British foreign
policy: national independence, the alliance with the US, and the integrated
Nato organisation. Unfortunately, the world is not like that any longer.
In the US this week, Mr Major has been trying to resurrect the 'special
relationship', and President Bill Clinton has humoured him with some
friendly TV exposure and an overnight stay in the White House. But recent
events belie these flattering gestures.
When the US president gave a temporary visa to Mr Gerry Adams, president of
Sinn Fein, it was not to advance the peace process in Northern Ireland; it
was to advance domestic support for his healthcare programme in the US. Mr
Clinton does not care about a 400-year-old colonial conflict in Ireland; why
should he?
Or take Bosnia. After the mortar attack on the Sarajevo market, the US
president virtually threatened a diminution of US support for Europe's
defence if Britain did not agree to the new policy of bombing the Serbs.
Since the US has hitherto done its best to keep well away from any
engagement in the Bosnia conflict, and shows no sign of being prepared to
get more deeply engaged in the future, his warning can only be taken as a
disturbing indicator of the depth of his administration's commitment to
Europe.
This might not matter if we could look ahead to a long era of peace and
sunlit security. In fact, events in Russia and some of its neighbours make
it much more likely that we are facing a period of profound instability, and
possibly danger. If President Clinton prefers to lead the western alliance
from behind, in the case of a localised civil war in Bosnia, what will be
his attitude in the event of bigger disturbances further east? We may not
know the answer to that question. But a prudent politician would surely be
looking for an insurance strategy in Europe, not begging for reassurance in
a fading 'special relationship'.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Unitary authorities should not be
forced on public
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms JOSIE FARRINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Authers is right to point out 'Lack of consensus plagues councils
shake-up' (25 February). I would like to clarify the Association of County
Council's position.
Where local people prefer the present structure they should be allowed to do
so, and all available opportunities should be taken to make that structure
work better. New unitary authorities should not, as the Local Government
Commission has said, be forced upon a public which does not support them.
When asked to make choices, more people have cited a positive preference for
the status quo. The recent judicial review successes of Derbyshire and
Lancashire County Councils mean that the status quo is a firm option.
Change should only be proposed for any area with the full agreement of local
people following a thorough review and consideration of the options. Your
article assumes this case has been made in more areas than it has. In our
view the review of local government should be conducted on a flexible and
pragmatic basis.
Where the case for change is made and locally agreed, the ACC believes that
unitary authorities need to be large and powerful enough to have effective
strategic capacity;
they should also be able to avoid the unaccountable joint arrangements which
would recreate a worse two-tier system. Small unitary authorities without
any other tier between themselves and national government would lead to a
fragmentation of local government and its main services.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Arts: What you see when the Sky's the limit - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is 10.30 on Saturday morning and on screen a black woman is shouting 'Git
yo' arse up boy]' Zap to the next channel and you find a singing cowboy:
'Theer's a honky tonk on ther edge 'o town,' he moans. Zap on again and you
find yourself looking at a big close-up of a jewelled ring. 'It's a
convenient ring to wear at any time,' says a woman with an estuary accent.
Which ring isn't, you wonder, as you note the price: Pounds 114 plus Pounds
3.50 p&amp;p. Flick forwards once more and you see three teenagers sitting at a
table. 'The Revenoo Act of 1797 was inner-dooced ter replace the Stamp Act,'
says one. His friend who is drinking milk through a straw laughs and the
milk shoots out of his ears.
This is satellite television. The black woman is on the pop video channel
MTV. The cowboy appears to be on the Discovery channel which specialises in
old American documentaries, but their transponder is being shared by CMT
(Country Music Television). The convenient ring is on QVC, a shopping
channel which, astonishingly, you cannot watch without paying a
subscription, even though its output consists solely of sales pitches from a
team of cloned presenters. The ear trick occurs on the American children's
channel Nickelodeon.
If your satellite dish, like most, points at the Astra satellite you can now
receive 48 channels in addition to BBC1, BBC2, ITV and C4. Depending upon
the time of day, anything between 20 and 30 of these will be in foreign
languages, nearly all German, though Galavision is Spanish, JSTV Japanese,
and TV Asia, which piggybacks on the transponders of Nickelodeon and Sky
Movies Gold, is in various Asian languages. On most days, at times when most
people are free to view, there are now 17 satellite channels delivering
programmes in English. Eleven of these are entirely or predominantly
American: Bravo (old movies), Children's (many cartoons), CNN (news),
Discovery &amp; CMT, Movie Channel, MTV, Nickelodeon, Sky Movies, Sky Movies
Gold and Sky 1. The services which can reasonably be called British are the
shopping channel QVC, Sky News, Sky Sport, UK Gold (showing old British TV
series) and the women's channel, UK Living. Eurosport is international.
About 3.5 million people in Britain live in homes which have paid to get
access to these extra services, mostly via dishes, though a minority are
served by cable. The main channel provider is, of course, Rupert Murdoch's
News International via its satellite television outfit, Sky, in which
Pearson (owner of the FT) has a significant stake. Since Sky scrambled most
of its channels last summer and began charging subscriptions varying from
Pounds 7 to Pounds 20 a month for different 'packages', more and more people
have been paying a monthly fee for this form of extra television. The
smallest package costs Pounds 83.88 a year which is more than the BBC
licence fee. If you take the whole Sky package the annual fee is Pounds
239.88.
Yet the remarkable fact is that the people who pay these prices still spend
much the larger part of their viewing time watching the old terrestrial
channels. Using the BARB figures jointly issued by the BBC and commercial
television for the week ending February 13, the most recent available, it is
possible to construct the following 'Top 10 Channels' list based on audience
share inside satellite and cable equipped homes:
1. ITV: 29.9 per cent
2. BBC1: 26.0 per cent
3. C4: 7.7 per cent
4. BBC2: 5.8 per cent
4. Sky 1: 5.8 per cent
6. Sky Movies: 3.8 per cent
7. Movie Channel: 3.6 per cent
8. Sky Sports: 2.9 per cent
9. UK Gold: 2.3 per cent
10. TNT/Cartoon: 2.1 per cent
This accounts for 89.9 per cent of viewing. The other 10.1 per cent is split
between the other satellite channels with Sky News, for instance, taking 1.1
per cent and the Family Channel 0.4 per cent. Thus even in homes where the
satellite is available, the four old terrestrial channels take a 69.4 per
cent share while the dozens of satellite channels all put together achieve
only 31 per cent. Why? The fashion now among the satellite people is to
argue that we should not see their channels as alternatives but merely as
adjuncts. There is some strength in this where the specialised channels are
concerned: viewers can be expected to dip in and out of Sky Sport or The
Movie Channel and not watch them as they might watch, say, BBC1. The same
hardly applies to Sky 1, however, which set out to be a general
entertainment channel capable of challenging similar channels. Yet it only
manages to match BBC2's share.
The satellite does offer items unavailable elsewhere. Once you have the
service in the house, Sky News and CNN quickly become your first reference
points for breaking news: you do not have to wait for the fixed bulletins at
7.00 pm or 9.00. In the past week I have seen, on UK Gold, the final episode
of The Hitch Hiker's Guide To The Galaxy which I missed twice on the BBC. On
Sunday night the Movie Channel screened The Lover, a film which some would
regard as soft porn but others might say was a non-violent Ai No Corrida. It
certainly has enough explicit eroticism to ensure that the strait-laced
terrestrial channels will not show it. For those who can take the tedium,
the German channels regularly offer a teutonic type of Carry On movie
featuring much lederhosen and bonking; since the dialogue is irrelevant it
is no disadvantage to speak no German. And the Sky News political
discussion, Target, with Norman Tebbit and Austin Mitchell interrogating
somebody, is nearly always good value.
Is that enough to justify the extra outlay? Almost certainly not in most
ordinary homes. It is not an inspiring experience to switch to the
satellite, zap through 20 or 30 channels, and find that virtually all of
them are showing old American material featuring, naturally enough, American
accents and American values, from guns to god.
Between 7.00 this evening and 1.30 tomorrow morning Sky 1 offers nine
series, all bought secondhand from the US, and nothing else. I had hoped to
be able to add that the first major drama to be commissioned by Sky 1, an
adaptation of the Ken Follett thriller Red Eagle, screened in two-hour
chunks on Sunday and Monday, proved that matters were improving.
Unfortunately, although the locations and credits said 'Money]', this was a
distressingly poor piece of work, badly directed, brimful of cliches, and
badly acted.
Matters can only improve, surely.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Arts: The 3 Lives of Lucie Cabrol - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Watching the performers in Theatre de Complicite's current production, The 3
Lives of Lucie Cabrol, you can see what extraordinary performers all seven
of them are. The show reveals also how well the company creates theatre in
umpteen different ways - by using movement, speech, music, lighting, props,
scenery. But what is best is how all this virtuosity and variety are
directed simply into telling the story. And, though the story is modern
(written by John Berger), you follow this Complicite version as intensely as
you read a Grimms' fairytale.
Lucie Cabrol, the story's heroine, is a tough, tiny, gnarled daughter of the
soil - and an embodiment of whatever is indomitable about the European
peasant spirit. Born in 1900, she lives through both world wars, working the
land, and living off it. Some village men depart for war, for Paris, for the
Americas, and of them a few are killed and injured. Other men stay and work
the land, including two of Lucie's brothers, who betray her and finally,
when she is in her 40s, turn her out. So ends Lucie's first life.
The Complicite production tells this narrative with wonderful seamlessness.
We hear of wartime deaths; we see the labourers at work on the land with
their scythes; and, of course, the double meaning of 'scythes' strikes home.
Lucie herself, is as sharp and strange and aggressive as a figure from myth
 -Rumpelstiltskin, or Puck.
Lucie's second life is as a loner, living outside the village, selling
mushrooms and berries, smuggling cigarettes at a profit, hoarding her
profits vindictively. (The way we see her pluck unseen berries, from human
'branches', and store unseen mushrooms in her skirts, is one of the show's
brightest details.) Jean, the man who got away without marrying her,
returns, and she tells him of her life. She is so tough - and so determined
even now to marry him - that we think she will live forever; but no. The
third life of Lucie Cabrol is as a ghost, claiming Jean from beyond the
grave like some bizarre old goblin Cathy haunting some old minor-league
Heathcliff.
The 3 Lives of Lucie Cabrol is not a perfect show. A few elements of the
story are unclear and the scenery for the finale sets up a stronger parallel
to the Crucifixion than the story can sustain. The taped (very cinematic)
sound accompaniment by Christopher Shutt is sometimes too intrusive and too
crude.
Even so, this is one of the most riveting pieces of theatre to be seen in
Britain today. Lilo Baur's impersonation of Lucie has a terrific force (if
played occasionally too much for effect); and, as Jean, Simon McBurney gives
the most remarkable performance amid a remarkable ensemble. (No wonder, for
he, with Mark Wheatley, adapted the story; and he has directed the whole
staging.) Somehow he manages to be aged before his time, perplexed,
sensitive, and huggable, all at the same time. While Lucie, at the climax of
her stormy narration, pours out, on her knees beneath the Madonna, her angry
frustrations, the most affecting thing of all is how way McBurney, sitting
and watching her awkwardly, simply shifts his weight. He becomes the heart
of the story and the production.
At Riverside Studios, W6, 081-748-3354, until April 9.

Teenagers born in the 1980s (yes, there really are such things) will
presumably feel as nostalgic about The Rock'n'Roll Years - The 80s as we
used to about the early series which harked back to the 50s and 60s. The new
series begins with the year when Charles and Di were married and Ronald
Reagan became American president:1981 (7.00 BBC1).
That is followed by the first edition of Here And Now, a BBC1 current
affairs programme offering three film reports in 30 minutes: a format which
has been used astonishingly little in Britain. Today's reports include an
update on 'Little Irma', the Bosnian girl whose much-publicised flight to
London had nothing to do with improving certain people's political images
 .(7.30).
Dispatches reports that coal mines are being closed to make the industry an
attractive privatisation prospect (9.00 C4). BBC2 shows the drama/movie
Genghis Cohn in its 'Screen Two' slot: a story of a Nazi possessed by the
ghost of a Jewish comedian, starring Anthony Sher and Robert Lindsay (9.00).

FT  02 MAR 94 / Arts: A Greek tragedy in Moscow - Arkady Ostrovsky reviews
'The Oresteia'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The German theatre director Peter Stein could hardly have found a better
venue for the ancient Greek tragedy, Aeschylus's Oresteia, when he arrived
in Moscow: the stage of the 'Central Theatre of The Soviet Army'.
Just as in Aeschylus's times when the audience would spend the whole day in
theatre, Stein's production of The Oresteia lasts 9 1/2 hours. The theatre
works as an ideal set; it seems only natural when the great warrior
Agamemnon appears on this stage decorated by military symbols. On stage is a
high black wall with a big door in the middle. Every entrance or exit
through the door brings tragic news or death to the city of Argos,
represented by a chorus of 12 men dressed in black coats.
All the leading parts are played by the same actors who make up the chorus.
Each actor in turn steps out of the crowd in order to play his part. The
black wall sets off the appearance of Clytemnestra (Ekaterina Vasilyeva).
She is the only one who never steps back into the chorus - she stands out,
not only as a character, but as an actress as well.
The killing of Agamemnon and Cassandra is one of the best scenes in the
whole production. According to the rules of Greek drama the killing takes
place behind the black wall, inside the house. We see only the result.
Soiled with blood, Clytemnestra appears on the moving platform. The dead
bodies of Agamemnon and Cassandra lie at her feet. Blood slowly streams from
the platform onto the floor. Clytemnestra's monologue is accompanied by the
monotonous sound of dripping blood; by the end of her speech it makes a big
puddle.
Vasilyeva's Clytemnestra is a mixture of goddess and barbarian. She stands,
with feet wide apart in black stockings, with a tucked up skirt; her white
shirt is tied in a knot. Clytemnestra has been waiting for this moment for
ten long years, since Agamemnon killed their daughter, Iphigenia. She holds
a sword and smiles, probably experiencing the same feeling of satisfaction
as Agamemnon did when Troy fell.
For her, the killing of Agamemnon is justified and fair. After her
monologue, it seems fair to the audience also. In fact, every murder in this
tragedy is justified; but the pool of blood threatens to engulf them all.
Unfortunately, however, the tragedy ends when the actress disappears from
the stage. All that happens after this resembles a Christmas pantomime.
Athena flies like a fairy across the stage in a silver dress; Apollo appears
in a laurel wreath, with a lyre in his hands; the badly made-up Furies run
up and down the stage as if trying to frighten bad boys and girls who fail
to listen to their parents.
All this seems totally divorced from the previous two parts. Apollo here is
a trivial joker, who would hardly be capable of sending Orestes off to kill
Clytemnestra since he is too busy making cheap comments about the jury and
flirting with Athena. Members of the jury behave like the Russian parliament
and the whole trial scene turns into a rather primitive skit on Russian
political life.
Stein, in apparently deciding to 'update' this great tragedy, made a
mistake: Russian audiences no longer appreciate superficial political hints
in the direction of the government. Paradoxically, the high tone of
Ekaterina Vasilyeva's acting reveals much more about the problems of the
modern world than any of the Apollo's cheap jokes.
In Moscow, then goes on tour in Germany

Matthew Epstein, general director of Welsh National Opera, resigned
yesterday, St David's Day, writes Antony Thorncroft.
He gave as his reason the parlous financial state of the WNO. 'This year's
funding decision, and those intimated for the future, are simply not
acceptable in the face of the WNO's record of international artistic success
and acclaim.'
Epstein, an American, led the WNO for just under three years. He recently
announced redundancies and cancelled productions brought about by a
deteriorating financial situation.
Taken with the threats of Simon Rattle to quit the CBSO for similar reasons
it will put pressure of Peter Brooke, Heritage Secretary, to raise arts
funding.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Business and the Environment: Politics ahead of science -
The debate surrounding waste disposal around the world, in the first of a
series
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Disposing of mounting piles of waste is one of the hardest environmental
problems for governments to get right. Few have yet done so. The issue
causes political pitfalls. In many industrialised countries, recycling is
one of the few 'green' issues which reliably stirs up public passion even
when recession has muted other concerns about the environment. It gives
economists headaches: are taxes or regulation the best tools, and how tough
should they be?
These debates also take place against a backdrop of scientific controversy
about which disposal methods harm the environment least, a debate
handicapped by a shortage of thorough research. 'Much recycling does not
make economic sense - and some of it uses more energy than it saves,' says
Steve Webb, policy director of the UK's National Association of Waste
Disposal Contractors (NAWDC).
Industrialised countries are now grappling with attempts to improve the
control of solid waste from every part of their economies, from households
and industry to agriculture and mining.
The European Union is working on a new directive to insist that a majority
of packaging is recycled. More than 70 countries worldwide - with the
notable exception of Russia - agreed last month to ban dumping of
radioactive material at sea. North Atlantic countries have signed a similar,
tighter, treaty restricting many kinds of industrial dumping at sea.
Meanwhile, the US Superfund legislation on cleaning up contaminated land,
one of the most ambitious pieces of environmental regulation yet passed, is
soon due for re-authorisation. Superfund's critics argue that full
compliance could cost the private sector Dollars 500bn (Pounds 342bn) and
the government's defence and energy departments, and that overhaul of the
rules is urgently needed.
This legislative effort on solid waste tends to be greatest in developed
countries. For these parts of the world, air and water pollution can seem
more pressing - a ranking of priorities acknowledged by the Chinese
environment ministry, for example.
Yet although much regulation has been in the pipeline for years, recession
in industrialised countries has made industry more reluctant to pay. It has
stimulated questions as to whether the rules will really protect the
environment and whether the price being asked is too high.
Putting numbers on the size of the world's waste problem is difficult,
partly because defining waste is no trivial question. Proponents of
waste-to-energy - incineration of rubbish to extract heat - argue that much
household rubbish can be regarded as a raw material. What is waste at one
time can be re-exploited later - witness the growing practice of washing
east European slag heaps to extract more coal.
Occasionally problems of definition lead to farce. Polish steel makers have
suffered shortages of steel scrap to melt down because Polish scrap has been
exported to earn hard currency, but imports of scrap have been restricted
because it was defined as waste, steel industry companies say.
Nevertheless, OECD figures suggest that municipal waste grew at between 1-2
per cent a year during the 1980s, slightly behind growth in GDP. Recession
slowed that growth, but European waste companies expect the rate soon to
resume to that of the last decade.
Figures also point to a second problem: the growing proportion of plastics,
which contain complex chemicals, sometimes toxic, that make them hard to
recycle. In the past 15 years, the proportion of municipal waste made up of
plastics has risen by several per cent in most OECD countries to between 8
per cent and 15 per cent, largely at the expense of glass.
Countries are now weighing up a range of solutions for tackling these
trends. One vocal lobby says that waste disposal costs (and energy costs)
should rise steeply to encourage companies to use resources more
efficiently.
Companies acknowledge that this works: ICI, the international chemicals
group, says that its paints division has cut its waste by more than half in
the past four years because of tighter regulation.
But economists, such as Dieter Helm, director of Oxera, the Oxford-based
forecasting group, argue that measures like these simply produce a one-off
shift in behaviour, and avoid longer term questions of picking the right
waste strategy.
The main options, once the waste exists, are recycling, incineration,
burying it or dumping in rivers and the sea. The tendency of regulation in
the past few years has been to encourage each country - sometimes each
company or town - to deal with its own waste. In particular, that has cut
down the opportunities for dumping at sea, one of the cheapest outlets.
But many argue that these strategic decisions have not been taken on the
basis of scientific evidence. The UK government, which last month signed the
London Convention against dumping radioactive waste at sea because of 'the
weight of international pressure', argued that 'scientific evidence shows
that dumping at sea under controlled conditions causes no harm to the marine
environment'.
However, at home, its own enthusiasm for recycling has come under similar
attack. NAWDC argues that while recycling aluminium cans saves energy,
recycling plastics does not - a conclusion which Dow Chemicals supports.
According to Webb: 'Politicians concentrate on household waste because
people like to be told to recycle.' But household waste makes up only 20m
tonnes - around a seventh - of the total, including industrial and
commercial waste.
The consequences of shaping complex regulation with too little regard to the
underlying science are serious, however: an extra burden on industrial costs
that could harm competitiveness.
True, the sharp differences in landfill costs between countries (see table)
are partly the result of local geography. In the Netherlands, fears of
polluting the water table mean that landfills are scarce while in the UK,
geology and extensive quarrying for building materials have left a large
number of suitable holes to be filled in, and landfill absorbs around 85 per
cent of waste.
But the disparities are also due to the strictness of regulation. Waste
companies this week warned the UK government that its proposed waste
management rules could add a third to landfill costs, and proposals for a EU
landfill directive would have an even greater impact.
Perhaps the best example of the difficulty of judging the impact of waste
regulation is the German packaging recycling scheme. The mandatory recycling
targets pushed Duales System Deutschland, the scheme operator, into
near-bankruptcy and mounds of unwanted paper and plastics were sent across
the German borders.
Politicians have appeared tolerant of the environmental lobbies, which have
gradually ruled out cheap ways of disposing of waste. But the enthusiasm for
recycling in particular shows how their impulses can too easily lead to
rules which are expensive and even environmentally damaging.
David Pearce, a leading environmental economist and former adviser to the UK
government, points out adeptly in his recent book, Blueprint 3 - measuring
sustainable development, that waste disposal is an area where governments
have been particularly poor in weighing up costs and benefits. The risk, he
warns, is that their strategies lead to inefficiency and a waste of
resources.
Some of the legislation in the pipeline - in particular the EU packaging
directive - offers a chance to remedy those flaws. But in general, waste
management is a case of politics running too far ahead of economics and
science.
Next week's article focuses on Japan.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Business and the Environment: Buddhists clash with hoteliers
 -Efforts to preserve Japan's ancient capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Walking through the dark wooden gates of Kouryuji, Kyoto's oldest Buddhist
temple, visitors are greeted by a sign politely refusing entry to those
staying at the Kyoto Hotel.
The temple is one of 1,000 in Japan's ancient capital embroiled in a
longstanding row with the city's oldest luxury hotel. The Kyoto is being
rebuilt into a high-rise structure due to be completed this summer.
For the past three years, the Kyoto Buddhist Association has been protesting
that the height of the new hotel - 60m - could detract from the skyline of
the ancient religious and cultural
city.
'Of course we can't really check where people are staying, but it's our way
of standing our ground,' says Chikou Kiyotaki, Kouryuji's chief priest.
The Japanese are destroying with their own hands even what the Americans
chose to preserve,' he says, referring to the decision by the US air force
during the second world war not to bomb Kyoto's numerous temples and
gardens.
In 1988, restrictions on the height of buildings in Kyoto were eased from
45m to 60m in an effort to boost development and investment. But Akira
Nakajima, a lawyer and leader of a group of residents against the urban
development of Kyoto, says the height restriction had protected the view of
the mountains surrounding the city.
The Buddhist monks lost a lawsuit against the hotel in 1992, but have
continued to apply pressure. They have been calling for the disclosure of
the city's approval procedures for buildings. Last year the city council
announced new construction laws to protect certain areas around historic
foundations.
Meanwhile, the city's efforts to revitalise the industrial area south of the
city, including the reconstruction of Kyoto station, have met with
controversy.
Kyoto's business community regards the new station as the main celebratory
project of the city's 1,200th anniversary this year. The city council and
local businessmen asked seven leading architects, including the late Sir
James Stirling and Peter Busmann, to submit designs for the station. A
400m-wide by 60m-high glass and concrete avant garde structure designed by a
Japanese architect was chosen.
Norihisa Taniguchi, managing director of the station planning company, says
the building, which will be completed in 1996, will become the new symbol of
the city - the 'Eiffel Tower of Kyoto'.
The group in support of development in central Kyoto claims residents have
the right to a normal city life. 'People don't want to live in old wooden
houses and become victims of construction restrictions,' says Takeshi
Tanaka, managing director of the Kyoto Hotel.
He claims the city is experiencing a population drain, especially with
university campuses moving out due to building height limits, taking the
students with them. Nakajima argues, however, that development in the city
is driving people away, adding that it should 'not be just about building
high-rise buildings'. He says the city planners of Kyoto lack a
comprehensive vision of what the city should look like.
Although temples around the foot of the mountains surrounding the city have
remained unscathed, many in central Kyoto have not. The wave of urban
development during the economic 'bubble' in late 1980s enabled developers to
construct office buildings and condominiums around the small temples and
shrines in the centre of the city.
Kiyotaki offers the pro-development camp a few words for contemplation: 'If
Kyoto ceases to become Kyoto, who will want to visit?'

FT  02 MAR 94 / People: Charter acquires directors - only
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Charter, the industrial group, has named three new non-executive directors -
but denied that their identities gave any clue to the group's well-flagged
intention of making a substantial acquisition.
Charter was left with about Pounds 150m in cash after unwinding its links
last year with Anglo American Corporation, the South African mining group.
Sir Chips Keswick, joint deputy chairman of the merchant bank Hambros, is
retiring after six years as a non-executive director. Jeff Herbert,
Charter's chief executive, says Sir Chips had been appointed to the board to
represent the South Africans, but had agreed to stay on until the
restructuring process was completed.
Sir Chips's role as City heavyweight will be filled by Peter Allen, who will
join the board as a non-executive when he retires from Coopers &amp; Lybrand at
the end of April. Allen, 55, has worked for the accountancy firm since 1963.
He became managing partner in 1985 and was appointed deputy chairman in
1990.
The two non-executives appointed with immediate effect are John Neill and
Neil Johnson. Neill, 46, is chief executive of Unipart Group and has
considerable experience in the automotive supply industry. Johnson, 44, has
spent most of his career in engineering. He was formerly director-general of
the Engineering Employers' Federation, following a period with British
Aerospace. He is general secretary of the RAC.
Herbert says the background of neither man gives a lead on his plans to add
an extra leg to Charter's businesses, which supply equipment to the mining
and rail industries, and building products, including quarrying. He says:
'Both have considerable experience in industry - that is the important
thing. They are also slightly younger - which should give them more energy.'
Charter believes most quoted UK companies look overvalued and is more likely
to buy a division from a multinational or consider countries where companies
are on a lower rating. Herbert says: 'We have been casting our net a bit
wider. There are several interesting things we are looking at right now -
but we've been doing that for some time.'

FT  02 MAR 94 / People: Fisons finds FD in Hankinson
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fisons has concluded the long search for a finance director by appointing
David Hankinson, formerly of Ranks Hovis McDougall and Lucas Industries.
Hankinson, 54, is a well-known figure among the ranks of finance directors.
He achieved some prominence a year ago when he left RHM on its takeover by
industrial group Tomkins, only five months into a three year contract
earning Pounds 160,000 a year. This came less than a year after he left
Lucas Industries with a Pounds 352,000 handshake.
From 1989 to 1992 he was finance director at Lucas Industries and, between
1986 and 1989, finance director at Rover group holdings. He left when the
government sold its stake in the company to British Aerospace.
Hankinson graduated in law from Cambridge and qualified as an accountant
with Arthur Andersen. After 11 years there, he joined Midland bank as a
financial controller and moved on, via George Wimpey, to Guthrie
Corporation, his first finance director post in 1979. He worked at
Wilkinsons Sword and Chloride before Sir Graham Day headhunted him to be
group finance director at Rover.
Fisons has been hunting for a finance director since the early retirement of
Roy Thomas in December 1993. It is still seeking a chief executive - Cedric
Scroggs was ousted in December 1993 when the company issued a profits
warning. 'A number of candidates' have been seen and the search is
continuing, Fisons said yesterday. (See Observer)

FT  02 MAR 94 / Management: Qualities that count - Lucy Kellaway studies a
new list that attempts to set standards in Britain's boardrooms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What does it take to make a good chief executive? And what to make a good
chairman, or a good executive director? What about non-executives?
These seem pretty basic questions yet they are ones which companies rarely
ask themselves. While academics write papers about 'key competences', there
are few signs that boards of directors take any notice.
Last week the UK's Institute of Directors and the Henley Management College
attempted to answer the questions in a way that they hope will be of
practical use.
With admirable precision, they have drawn up a list of no fewer than 29
qualities which are deemed essential in boardrooms of companies from the
biggest to the smallest. They have considered each different role on the
board and allocated the qualities accordingly.
The chief executive turns out to need all but four of these qualities, the
chairman needs 18, the executive directors need just 10, while non-executive
directors need only nine. The idea is that companies have a yardstick
against which to hire new directors and to measure existing ones (sending
them off on courses to acquire those qualities which they do not possess).
The lists are part of an even more ambitious project to set general
standards for all aspects of board behaviour and performance. When IoD and
Henley set about writing such guidelines - at the government's invitation -
it quickly became clear that there was little point in discussing the tasks
of boards without reference to the quality of its members.
The lists are likely to be one of the most controversial parts of their
report*. The authors are asking for comments, but may not be prepared for
what may be a lively debate, to put it politely. There will be screams of
protest from those who reckon the wrong qualities have been selected, as
well as from those who feel directors are so diverse there is little point
in looking for common characteristics.
Victor Dulewicz of Henley Management College, co-author of the report, warns
that it is still only in draft form, and that in any case the lists are
meant to be applied with flexibility. 'We are not saying this is the list.
We are saying: use it as a starting point.'
He argues that the selection of British directors is dangerously amateurish.
Companies use sophisticated tests when recruiting senior and middle managers
 -sending them to assessment centres and running psychometric tests, yet
when it comes to choosing the most important people, most decisions are made
on a seat-of-the-pants basis. 'These lists are more systematic than the
methods some companies are using,' he says.
Even so, people are already arguing that the list is not complete, and is
full of inconsistencies. For instance, it is not clear why chairmen need to
be good talkers but chief executives do not. Nor why non-executives need to
be good at criticising, but need not be so good at analysing problems.
Worse, many people - Sir Adrian Cadbury among them - would say independence
is the most important trait of the non-executive. Yet this is nowhere on the
list.
Colin Coulson-Thomas, academic and consultant in boardroom practice, agrees
that the list contains some alarming omissions. Directors, he says, must be
self-aware. They must be constantly learning. They must also be robust as
individuals. 'Some people seem to be doing well, but they are skating on
thin ice. The moment anything looks dangerous they resign.'
In response, Dulewicz points out that the list was not something dreamed up
by the authors, but reflects the distilled views of 340 experienced
directors. As such, it says much about the current preoccupations of boards.
The only two qualities which are deemed essential for all board members are
integrity and a 'change orientated' disposition. Post-Cadbury, everybody
feels obliged to pay at least lip-service to integrity, while managing
change is a concept so fashionable that it is heresy to question it.
More fundamental are the complaints that the very nature of the project is
flawed. Headhunters who make a living by selecting directors reckon that
lists are unusable as a practical tool. 'In theory it might be useful to
have a checklist. But you couldn't recruit using this,' says Ian Butcher of
Whitehead Mann.
Coulson-Thomas argues that the main weakness of lists is that they cannot
take account of the relationship between board members. 'People can be
excellent on one board and hopeless on another. It is to do with whether
they complement the strengths of other board members. There is no point in
putting them through a test if they are going to prove incompatible,' he
says.
He reckons that the skills you need as a manager are relatively easy to
define, and therefore lend themselves to formal assessment. By contrast, at
board level an outstanding director might fail on many of the listed
qualities, yet have two or three dazzling strengths that more than
compensate for these weaknesses. 'Those people tend to be lost when people
use models of identikit candidates,' Coulson-Thomas says.
Even those commentators who are friendly to the idea of a list of qualities
are worried about the application. John Hunt of the London Business School
refers to academic research that has succeeded in linking certain qualities
of directors to company performance. Many of these are similar to those on
the IoD list. They include interpersonal skills, strategic awareness,
information processing and motivational drive.
However, he reckons the lists can still be dangerous in the hands of
careless companies. 'They are an improvement on the 'do you know Fred, he's
a good chap' sort of recruitment,' says Hunt. But there is a risk that some
organisations are assessing people on these characteristics but are using
dubious instruments. They might be looking for the right qualities, but they
have no appropriate means of finding them.
While not everyone agrees with the report, most would argue that the present
boardroom practice is far from ideal. Recent research in the UK has shown
that fewer than one in eight companies makes any attempt to measure the
effectiveness of its directors. Regardless of the value of the 29 qualities,
anything that gets companies to question whether their directors are suited
to their jobs is progress.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Senior European company executives are being invited to 'vote' for Europe's
Most Respected Companies in a new survey by the Financial Times in
association with Price Waterhouse.
Business leaders will be asked to nominate companies in their particular
sector based on seven specific qualities.
They will be asked to consider the standard of customer focus, customer
loyalty and service, the quality of employees, products and services, and
the company with the most outstanding business performance - for example,
the company that has shown consistent growth and long-term profitability, is
a low-cost producer or whose results are used as a benchmark by others.
Participants will also be asked which company in their industry demonstrates
clear leadership and management qualities.
Other questions cover which companies have the most effective strategy,
perhaps in terms of policy and objectives or response to opportunities in
the emerging European market, and which companies care about the
environment.
Finally, respondents are invited to nominate the company which they admire
overall.
Almost 2,000 chairmen, chief executives and finance officers from 640
European companies are being invited to take part in the survey. The
companies span 21 sectors and include the largest quoted, state-owned and
private companies in 17 nations from Portugal to Turkey.
The results of the confidential questionnaires are expected to provide a
fascinating insight into which companies command most respect from their
peers, and why.
The Financial Times plans to publish the results of the survey, and the
winners of the award for Europe's Most Respected Companies, in the newspaper
later this year.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Management: Score card for the suppliers - A recent convert
to vendor appraisal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You do not need to be a 'total quality management' fanatic to recognise that
most companies would benefit considerably from making regular and detailed
assessments of the performance of their suppliers. Marks and Spencer, the UK
retailer, has done so for decades. Yet, except in retailing, 'vendor
appraisal' - the American term for the approach - still seems stuck on the
starting block.
US computer company Sun Microsystems, a relatively recent convert, says that
its experiences with the practice bear out two claims made for it: that it
raises suppliers' performance, and that they in turn benefit from, and
appreciate receiving, performance tracking.
Supplier effectiveness is crucial to the survival of the Dollars 4bn (Pounds
2.7bn) company, explains Mel Friedman, vice-president of corporate supplier
management. Sun has used its expertise with the 'Sparc' chip behind its
range of high-powered minicomputers to create an impressive global customer
base, but has fought shy of a heavy manufacturing involvement.
'Fifty five per cent of every revenue dollar goes to suppliers,' says
Friedman. It is unique among the group of companies with which it competes,
he points out, for operating without any chip fabrication facilities of its
own.
In part, the strategy has paid off. Sun's steady revenue growth has
outstripped the more vertically-integrated IBM, Digital Equipment and
Hewlett-Packard by several orders of magnitude. But earnings per share have
been more erratic, and four years ago prompted the company to seek an
improved - and more consistent - performance from its suppliers.
Given its high level of dependence on suppliers, the company was also
determined to monitor their effectiveness over a broader spectrum than
price, quality and delivery reliability. In order to assess the total cost
of dealing with a supplier, suppliers' ongoing technological development and
back-up support mattered too, Friedman argues.
Each supplier's performance against the company's 'score card' is reviewed
quarterly with members of the supplier's senior management. The long-term
objective is to dispense with periodic measurement and have the data online.
Several things make the Sun scheme stand out. One is the way it has been
extended beyond the core of suppliers who produce parts to go inside
computers; airlines and car rental companies have also been assessed.
Another is striving to avoid fuzzy measurements, even in areas such as
technical capability.
The company looks at suppliers' investment levels and what Friedman
describes as their 'technological road map' with precisely formulated
expectations. With printed circuit boards, for example, particular levels of
expertise are set as minimum standards.
Targets are constantly made tougher: three years ago 'on time delivery'
meant delivery within a time band stretching from three days early to one
day late. Now it means two days early and zero days late.
Moving the goalposts has disguised progress: although suppliers' score card
performance has only improved from 1.33 to 1.23 (1 is a 'perfect' score, 2
is failure) since the scheme's inception, this is misleading. On a constant
measurement criteria basis, claims Friedman, suppliers' performance has shot
from 1.33 to 1.00 - in other words, to a level that Sun regarded as
perfection three years ago.
Suppliers' attitudes have been very positive, says Friedman. 'It's a
symbiotic relationship,' he argues. 'The attributes we measure help the
supplier.'
Alastair Kelly, managing director of Design to Distribution, the newly
autonomous subcontract manufacturing operation of UK computer supplier ICL,
agrees.
The volume of Sun business which he undertakes has grown tenfold to Dollars
34m since 1990, and he has now imposed the Sun vendor assessment approach on
his own suppliers. 'It's the best bit of free benchmarking I get,' he says.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Recruitment: Motivation may mean more than marks - The art
of the hunch has the merit of not wasting time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Here is one of those probably apocryphal tales that you find impossible to
source but which you want to believe is true because it supports a personal
belief or prejudice. I heard it last week from a Bank of England official at
a discussion on ethical concerns in recruitment and selection held at London
Business School.
All she provided for verification was an assurance that the person who
passed the story to her was in a position to know the truth of it. She
recounted the story of some administrators of a college in further education
who had interviewed candidates for a course, then sent the acceptance slips
to the rejects and the rejection slips to those they had chosen to accept.
Instead of owning up to the mistake the administrators decided to let the
error go. Four years into the course, when they were able to compare the
performance of that year's intake with those in previous years, the would-be
rejects were achieving results on a par with their predecessors. It was
impossible to tell the difference.
The lesson to be drawn, suggested the bank official, was that organisations
might be worrying too much about recruitment when a concentration on
motivation and training could produce the same results or even better at the
end of the day.
The story, whether true or not, tends to reinforce the judgment of many
small businesses which, according to recent occupational psychology research
at Hull University, still rely heavily on the tried and untested indicator
of gut reaction when recruiting.
Accepting that the hunch is not an exact science it may, nevertheless, waste
less time than many recruitment practices, since another often-quoted
observation holds that most selections are decided within the first five
minutes of an interview, the rest of the time being used to confirm the
decision.
Even psychologists who might argue for greater objectivity would accept that
first impressions should not be underestimated. A friend in the recruitment
business recalls a personnel colleague who swore by all the latest
psychometric techniques but who was adamant that he would never recruit any
man who wore white socks or an earring.
Whatever your recruitment techniques, if you are considering taking a look
at psychological tests in an attempt to be more sophisticated you should
choose carefully. Some specialists have attempted to debunk even the most
trusted tests.
The field of psychometrics has never fully recovered from the broadside
delivered by Steve Blinkhorn and Charles Johnson in Nature magazine a few
years ago. The two psychologists, who run a consulting company, Psychometric
Research and Development, were severely critical of some of the most
respected personality tests on the market. They said: 'We see precious
little evidence that even the best personality tests predict job performance
and a good deal of evidence of poorly understood statistical methods being
pressed into service to buttress shaky claims.'
Most pointed of all was a remark condemning the way some tests were applied
which, they said, 'bamboozles an unsophisticated public with pseudo
science.' The criticism triggered outrage among other occupational
psychologists, particularly one of the leading test publishers which pointed
out that Blinkhorn and Johnson's company was a competitor.
The criticism did give rise to some consideration about whether some testers
were making exaggerated claims for their methods. In addition, the plethora
of tests on the market, some of them with very doubtful uses, led to the
conclusion that some standards were essential.
Recognising that the field is plagued by charlatans, the British
Psychological Society is preparing a certificate of competence for
psychologists administering personality tests.
These new Level B certificates, following on from the initial level A
certificates that cover ability testing, should be in place by the end of
the year. The new certificate is not a form of licensing for occupational
psychologists since the field is unregulated. Neither will it make tests
foolproof, but it will tell you that the holder has demonstrated some level
of competence.
Even before going down the testing route, some would advocate that
recruiters think carefully about what information they need and whether it
can be obtained any other way. Meanwhile the amount of guidance in the area
is improving.
The society produces a guide which can be obtained from its headquarters at
St Andrews House, 48 Princess Road East, Leicester LE1 7DR. In addition, the
Institute of Personnel Management publishes a code that also endorses the
society's certificates of competence. The code is available from the
institute's headquarters at IPM House, Camp Road, Wimbledon, London, SW19
4UX.
Executives who lose their jobs have a number of options for finding work if
they want to return to similar employment.
Drake Beam Morin, the outplacement and career management firm, claims that
professional outplacement counselling can markedly improve job prospects.
In support of this view, it has compared figures drawn from its own clients
with statistics in the Department of Employment's quarterly Labour Force
Survey. Some 14 per cent of DBM's clients have been unemployed for more than
12 months compared with 17 per cent a year ago.
In contrast, the labour force survey shows that 43 per cent of professionals
overall had been out of work for more than a year in 1993 compared with 30
per cent in 1992.
One reason for the discrepancy could lie in the fact that the top
outplacement companies tend to be engaged by large corporations to provide
services within their overall redundancy packages.
'The people we help have come from good companies which offer outplacement
services for their staff. They are shedding jobs for corporate reasons that
have no reflection on the potential of the individuals involved,' says DBM.
Some counselling services in what has been a growing and largely
uncontrolled industry over the past few years have earned parts of the
market a bad name.
Unemployed managers should be wary of counselling services that promise to
circulate CVs to potential recruiters. When I asked one recruiter about them
last week, he said: 'Yes we get these things in a big pile through the post
and they go straight in the bin. We don't value that kind of approach.'
The IPM published a code of conduct for the industry just over a year ago
and has listed 120 companies that fulfilled its requirements. It is now
reviewing whether to continue the directory. It said: 'The list goes some
way towards setting standards but we cannot enforce them so it does tend to
question their value.'
Good outplacement servicing offers a tiered approach, ranging from
counselling - where you are urged to sit back and think about what you want
to do with the rest of your career - to the identification of training needs
and practical guidance of how and where to find those hidden jobs that tend
to be advertised internally in the big companies.
Trade unions are beginning to break into this market in a small way. The
Society of Telecom Executives, with 22,000 members in the telecommunications
industry, established a career register for its members outside BT, which
has plans to shed thousands of managerial jobs over the next three or four
years.
The STE journal highlighted the success of one member, Mr Graham Rose, who
moved to a new telecommunications job in Nice, France, last Easter after
leaving his 18-year career in BT, finishing as a transmissions and budgets
manager.
After failing to find work from 40 job applications, his breakthrough came
when he received a mailing from the skills register. He said: 'It pays more
than twice what I got in BT, there are free French lessons, help with
accommodation and school fees and a great climate.'
The union has now decided to put the service on a more professional footing.

Europe's contribution to the evolution of information technology in the two
decades following the invention of the microprocessor has been strong in
telecommunications but weak in microelectronics and computing.
One measure is commercial success. Of the world's 12 leading telecoms
equipment companies in 1991, seven were European. Compare this with Europe's
overall position in information technology: only 12 of the world's top 100
IT companies in 1992 were European-owned, according to Datamation magazine.
Europe's top three, Siemens-Nixdorf, Olivetti and Groupe Bull, continue to
lose money heavily.
Europe's strength in telecoms is chiefly a consequence of protected markets.
Most European telecoms authorities and their suppliers continue to enjoy the
protection of regulated and monopolistic regimes. The European electronics
and computer companies have never had similar protection but their relative
failure involves complex factors including recession, inadequate finance and
insular markets which do not encourage economies of scale.
Europe's weakness also has much to do with its consistent failure to
contribute technically to the IT revolution.
It seems continually to be catching up rather than leading. Meanwhile, the
US is ploughing ahead with plans for a national information highway, for
example, while Europe is still debating the issue.
There is an exception. France invented, developed and championed the 'smart'
or computer card. It has now been adopted all over the world for
applications ranging from an electronic key to an electronic wallet.
The world market for microprocessors, nevertheless, is owned by the US
companies Intel and Motorola. Packaged software, both systems and
applications, is dominated by US suppliers such as Microsoft and Lotus. The
design of large computer systems has been increasingly relinquished to the
US and Japan.
How serious is the situation for Europe? Mr Pasquale Pistorio, chief
executive of SGS-Thomson Microelectronics, puts it bluntly: 'No advanced
industrial society can exist without controlled access to an advanced
electronics industry, which in turn cannot exist without controlled access
to an advanced semiconductor industry.' This sort of thinking has generated
a raft of attempts to turn the tide, chiefly in the form of EU research
programmes encouraging pan-European collaboration in 'pre-competitive'
research. Last year EU ministers decided that information technology should
have the lions' share (28.2 per cent or about Pounds 3bn) of the budget for
the Framework Research programme extending from 1994-98.
It will be the fourth such programme. Has the money been well spent? There
have been some successes. EU funds, for example, went into the development
of the ARM microprocessor, a small, fast chip designed for high-volume
production and well suited to tiny computers and games machines, which has
been adopted by Apple for its Newton pocket computer.
On the other hand ES2 - once hailed as the greatest success of the Eureka
programme, a Europe-wide initiative supporting market-oriented research -
has failed to live up to the highest expectations.
The ES2 story is instructive. The company, based in France and owned by a
consortium of European industrial groups, was founded to exploit what was
thought to be a large emerging market for chips which could be quickly
customised by electron beam for specific applications. At first it looked
likely to fulfil its promise, then the technology changed and chips which
could be tailored more cheaply gained a hold on the market.
ES2 remains profitable but it has not been a success on the scale envisaged.
'The analysts got their forecasts wrong,' says Mr Robin Saxby, formerly at
ES2 and now chief executive of chip-maker ARM.
Europe's best hope for the future seems to lie in the phenomenon which
damaged ES2's prospects - the dramatic rate of change in the IT industries.
No European chip maker could hope to capture a share of the personal
computer microprocessor market; but the trend is to smaller devices, opening
a window for ARM.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Ideas people at back of the field - How
Europe is failing in the race to innovate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON and ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe is being left behind in the race for scientific and technological
advantage between the world's main industrialised countries. It takes only a
few statistics to show how far Japan and the US have pulled ahead and how
rapidly they are increasing their lead.
While high technology products account for nearly a third of US exports and
more than a quarter of Japan's, they make up less than a fifth of those from
western Europe. Figures from the European Patent Office show that Europe is
falling behind the US and Japan in registering new inventions.
Mr Paul Braendli, the EPO's president, finds it alarming that initial patent
filings in Europe have not increased at all since 1987, while those in the
US have risen by 30 per cent and in Japan by 8 per cent.
'That is already a good indication that in Europe we are lazy in innovating
or do not exploit our innovations,' Mr Braendli says. 'Something must be
wrong.'
Yet comparing national strengths in science and technology is a hazardous
exercise, bedevilled by incompatible definitions. In principle, the inputs -
resources devoted to research and development - are simple to assess. It is
far harder to measure the quantity and quality of different countries'
scientific output.
Input data from the OECD in Paris show that Europe fell behind the US and
Japan in overall R&amp;D spending during the 1980s. The European performance was
held back particularly by the UK - the only industrialised country that
devoted a smaller proportion of gross domestic product to R&amp;D in 1991 than
in 1981 - and Germany, where there was only a marginal increase. France and
Italy pushed up spending more rapidly, from a lower base.
In 1991, the 12 EU countries devoted 1.96 per cent of GDP to R&amp;D, compared
with 2.74 per cent in the US and 2.87 per cent in Japan. Only Germany (2.66
per cent) came close to the American and Japanese levels.
Stripping out the high levels of military R&amp;D in the US and some European
countries, Japan takes a clear global lead. It spends 2.8 per cent of GDP on
civil science and technology, compared with 2.1 per cent in the US and 1.8
per cent in the EU.
There are many possible ways of assessing the output of R&amp;D. Its industrial
impact can be measured indirectly by the export/import ratios of
science-based industries. These show Europe's weakness in computers and
office machinery, with a ratio falling from 0.54 in 1985 to 0.39 in 1990
(compared to 3.96 for Japan and 0.95 for the US) - and its strength in
pharmaceuticals, where the ratio in 1990 was 1.78 (compared to 0.32 for
Japan and 1.65 for the US).
But success in manufacturing industries depends on many factors besides R&amp;D,
such as management and sales skills and quality control. A more direct
technique for assessing strength in science and technology is to measure the
quantity and quality of patents and scientific papers produced by a company
or country.
Europe's total share of US patents - seen as the most reliable measure of
competitive strength - has declined since 1980, due to a dramatic expansion
by Japan and more recently by the newly industrialised Asian countries. But
again, the decline is far from even. 'The figures clearly show European
countries going down the tubes in electronics but continuing to hold their
own in areas where they have traditionally been strong, such as drugs,
medicines and biotechnology,' says Dr Francis Narin, president of CHI
Research, a consultancy based in New Jersey, which tracks patents issued in
the US.
In drugs and medicines, the combined share of US patents held by Germany,
France and the UK slipped from 22.7 per cent in 1982 to 18.1 per cent in
1992. In electrical equipment, the corresponding European share fell from 16
per cent in 1982 to 10.1 per cent in 1992.
However, there are bright spots in Europe's science-based industries - even
in electronics. Siemens of Germany, the largest European electronics group,
is investing DM2.4bn (Pounds 900m) in Dresden, eastern Germany, to develop
and make powerful memory chips for the telecommunications and vehicle
markets. And Philips, the second largest, is challenging the Japanese
dominance of liquid crystal displays for portable computers, with a Fl200m
(Pounds 70m) plant next to its R&amp;D centre in the Netherlands.
In Sweden, Ericsson is investing 22 per cent of its turnover on developing
advanced new telecommunications products. It decided boldly in 1991 to spend
15 times as much on R&amp;D as on dividends, although some investors were
horrified. Now Ericsson has 60 per cent of the world market for digital
mobile phone systems and more than a third of its total orders are for
products that did not exist two years ago.
But on the whole Europeans are less willing to take risks with R&amp;D than
Americans - both at the corporate level and at the level of the individual
researcher. The Japanese may be conformists as individuals but they move
boldly as companies, as Sony showed when it created the Walkman market.
Reluctance to take risks is one of many factors - social, cultural,
political, educational and financial - blamed for Europe's failure to
translate basic research more effectively into faster economic growth.
Although there is no consensus about the relative importance of these
reasons, few doubt that Europe's continuing fragmentation is an important
handicap in the race with the relatively homogeneous US and Japan.
In general, therefore, Europe's strongest suit is pure science. The further
away a field lies from potential commercial application, the more likely it
is that Europe will be ahead. The latest example is high-energy physics:
Cern, the particle physics laboratory near Geneva on which 19 European
countries spend Pounds 400m a year, will have an undisputed world lead for
at least a generation, following last year's cancellation of the US
SuperConducting Supercollider (SCS).
The next discoveries about the fundamental forces and particles that hold
the Universe together are likely to be made in Europe - which may provide
some intellectual consolation to Europeans if the coming decades bring
economic decline.

Lagging in R&amp;D
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON and ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dr George Poste, research director of SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American
pharmaceutical group, and Prof Jurgen Drews, his counterpart at Roche of
Switzerland, divide their time almost equally between the US and Europe -
reflecting their companies' 50:50 split of R&amp;D facilities on either side of
the Atlantic. Both find the scientific infrastructure more hospitable in the
US.
The most important factor in determining where science-based companies
invest in research is the availability of R&amp;D personnel, Dr Poste says. 'I
don't think Europe has the same long-term potential as a source of skilled
personnel as the US.'
Although European universities are widely praised for the quality of their
basic research, many industrial scientists say they lag behind their
American counterparts in providing a useful service to industry, either as a
source of well educated graduates or as a partner in collaborative research
projects.
All industrial research managers agree that a fundamental handicap for
Europe is its political, cultural and economic fragmentation.
That makes it harder to mobilise technical resources for large-scale
strategic programmes.
Dr Frank Carrubba, an American who moved from California to the Netherlands
in 1991 to become chief technical officer of Philips, says an important
example is the Clinton administration's ambitious programme to stimulate the
construction of 'information superhighways' - communications networks that
will eventually enable every home and business to receive a wide variety of
multimedia electronic services. 'The US is already ahead by 2 1/2 years, if
not more, in many areas of multimedia and the information society.'
Dr Carrubba says Europeans need to appreciate the extent to which the
Clinton programme has galvanised the US electronics and information
industries into action. 'There's an incredible political drive behind it,
with (Vice-President) Al Gore going from school to school, town meeting to
town meeting, taking about information superhighways.
The problem is that Europe is not putting this high on the political agenda.
There have been some good individual projects here but very few focused
efforts.'
Europe has had success with focused efforts at high-techcollaboration in the
past. One is the European Space Agency whose efforts to develop a reliable
satellite launcher have led to a commercial operation in the form of
Arianespace, with more than half of the world market. Arguably, Airbus is
another in the aerospace field. Research collaboration on a broader front
has been gathering pace through the EU Framework programmes. The Fourth
Framework Programme will direct 12bn ecu (Pounds 9bn) at a wide range of
projects over the next five years, from computing to the life sciences.
But as Dr Poste sees it, 'the challenge is to move from a culturally
fragmented community to a union that can harness its enormous scientific
potential.
It is still bedevilled by the need to make sure that everything is spread
equally across the community, rather than being directed to where it would
do the most good.'

FT  02 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: A much quieter beat to the bio rhythm -
Biotechnology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Compared to the entrepreneurial and scientific ferment of the US
biotechnology industry, the European scene seems sedate.
Europe has nothing to match America's estimated 1,300 biotech businesses -
240 of them public companies - nor the volume of hype about their research
achievements, generated by a public relations machine keen to keep investors
happy. But the huge gap visible between the activity in the US and Europe
does not reflect such a big difference in real achievements.
'Don't be misled by the sight of a thousand biotech flowers blooming in the
US,' says Mr Brian Ager, director of Senior Advisory Group Biotechnology, a
European industry body. 'We don't have a full-scale industry but we have
large European companies using biotechnology within their operations.'
European pharmaceutical and chemical groups are plugging into US
biotechnology through a network of R&amp;D alliances with independent American
biotech companies. Roche of Switzerland led the way with its Dollars 2.1bn
purchase of a majority stake in Genentech in 1990; the Swiss group also has
minority stakes in Chiron and Protein Design Labs and collaborative
agreements with Amgen, Synergen and Hybridon, among others. Glaxo of the UK
is working with half a dozen US biotech companies.
'Most large European companies have embraced biotechnology, though it took
years to convince some of them that biotech was not a fad,' says Prof Jurgen
Drews, Roche's head of international R&amp;D.
The weakness of European biotech, as Prof Drews sees it, is 'that somehow
the translation of the science into entrepreneurial activity doesn't work
well. This has something to do with the legislation that has stigmatised
biotechnology in some European countries.'
Dr Peter Doyle, research director of Zeneca, the UK bioscience company, says
biotech is the area of science in which Europe has been handicapped by
over-regulation. But he and other leaders of the European biotech industry
are expressing more confidence that the political tide is turning.
This is the fifth part of a 10-part series. Tomorrow: Environment.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Wisdom in hills above Nice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Case Study: Sophia Antipolis, science park
On France's sun-filled Mediterranean coast, scientists strive to
commercialise laboratory ideas. Not everyone, however, can find the
winning formula
Half-buried on the hills outside Nice in the south of France sits a unique
cluster of high-technology companies and research establishments.
Off-duty scientists jog by low-slung buildings, housing pharmaceutical
laboratories and computer centres that handle world-wide transactions for
clients like Citibank or Air France. This is Sophia Antipolis, set up at the
end of the 1960s to bring top-class brainpower to a landscape of
Mediterranean pines and solar-powered street lights.
The science park, named after the Greek word for 'wisdom' and the historical
name for nearby Antibes, has grown into a small town. It provides jobs for
16,000 people of 40 nationalities, as well as places for 2,000 students at
an extension of Nice university.
Sophia Antipolis - about to celebrate its 25th anniversary this summer  -
has come of age. However, it is still struggling to make an impact in
overcoming the main problem faced by European science: leaping the hurdles
between the laboratory and the marketplace.
Mr Philippe Boulanger, the youthful managing director of a five-year-old
telecommunications concern, Access Privilege, illustrates one way the
obstacles can be overcome. After receiving a doctorate at Nice university,
he established his company with three partners in a small office complex
offering stunning views of the Alps.
His company has just been bought by the Sagem telephones group, in a deal
that will make him a millionaire. Mr Boulanger says his success has been
based on specialising in a field (in his case, networks using Apple
computers) where there was effectively no competition. He admits, however,
he knows only one other person in France who has had a similar breakthrough.
Another success story is FDM Pharma, based here since 1981. This 200-strong
company, which has hitherto doubled turnover every year, uses sophisticated
computer technology to record hospital drugs tests for US and European
pharmaceutical companies. Mr Benoit Bouche, the 33-year-old chairman, says
he brought the company to the science park after a top US scientist he
wanted to hire refused to move to its original headquarters in Lille in
northern France.
The official tally of corporations - totalling 980 - highlights the site's
attractiveness. Those present range from large concerns like Thomson,
Digital Equipment, AT&amp;T and Wellcome to many small businesses employing less
than 10 people.
Companies in the computer field have, however, been facing difficulties. The
international downturn in the computer industry has led to 400 job losses at
Digital (now down to 600 staff) and similar cuts at nearby research
establishments of IBM and Texas Instruments.
Mr Pierre Bernhard, director of the Sophia Antipolis branch of the public
sector computer research institute Inria, says the site's magnetic qualities
affects even those who have lost their jobs. Many computer engineers who
have recently been made redundant have stayed on to start new businesses.
Sophia Antipolis places a lot of hope on companies in the health care
sector. Mr Jacques Le Guillerm, managing director of the local offshoot of
Cordis, the US medical group, says the science park has been saved by its
multi-disciplinary structure. 'If we had simply had information technology
here, it would have been catastrophic.' Cordis research and production staff
here has grown from 150 to 200 during the last 18 months.
Mr Le Guillerm praises exchanges between pharmacological engineers and
information technologists at Sophia Antipolis. 'Synergy is now starting to
take off.' A long journey, however, still lies ahead.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Rule change urged for ITV groups: Ownership regime
'restrictive'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Independent Television Commission has come out in favour of a
fundamental reform of commercial television ownership rules to ease
restrictions on takeovers and allow newspapers to have larger stakes in
broadcasters.
In its submission to Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary who is
reviewing cross-media ownership regulations, the ITC says the present rules
are too restrictive.
In particular, the quality of ITV service could suffer unless something is
done about the disparity between large and small ITV groups.
The commission believes that the main terrestrial channels will continue to
dominate UK viewing into the next century. But as the number of cable and
satellite channels grows there is less justification for restrictions on
changes in ownership 'designed originally to cater for broadcasting services
in fixed overall supply'.
The best way to protect diversity of information sources while allowing
small regional ITV companies to be part of larger groups is to set a
market-share limit for ITV ownership rather than restricting ownership to
the present maximum two licences.
The ITC believes the ceiling should be set at 25 per cent of television
advertising revenue with no limit on licences.
The commission thinks newspaper groups should be able to take stakes in
broadcasters, short of control. This is defined as 30 per cent, compared
with the present 20 per cent. The ITC concludes this would be 'an
appropriate first step, to be reviewed for its effectiveness'.
ITV companies should be able to take stakes of up to 30 per cent in the
planned Channel 5 instead of 20 per cent.
The commission also attacks the government stipulation that the ITV
companies should hold less than 50 per cent of Independent Television News
by the end of this year. This 'lacks solid justification' and there is no
leading network in other parts of the world which is not able to control the
main source of its national and international news.
The ITC suggests that as satellite viewing increases there could come a
point when the cross-media restrictions which apply to terrestrial services
should also be applied to satellite services.
British Sky Broadcasting, in which Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation has
a 50 per cent stake and Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, is a
significant shareholder, is not subject to cross-media rules.
The possibility of undesirable dominance occurring through 'agenda setting'
means that restrictions on ownership should continue.
The ITC believes the government should define in terms of ownership or
revenue share when ownership restrictions should apply to the new cable and
satellite services.

FT  02 MAR 94 / N Ireland wins Pounds 36m plastics factory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three hundred jobs are to be created in Northern Ireland with the decision
by Benelux, a Hong Kong-based company, to build a Pounds 36.6m plastics
container factory at Limavady, County Londonderry.
The decision to site the plant in an area of the province which has already
attracted significant foreign investment was announced yesterday by Mr Tim
Smith, Northern Ireland economy minister.
Mr Smith said the factory should be in production by August. The factory is
planned for an 18-acre site, and will produce 20m compact disc containers
each month to be sold in Europe and the US.
Mr John McGuckian, chairman of Northern Ireland's Industrial Development
Board, said the investment represented another success in Ulster's efforts
to attract to the province Asian Pacific companies deciding to start
operations in Europe.
In the past 14 months two Korean companies - Carmen and Daesung - have
announced they are to invest in the province.
Carmen makes car stereos and Daesung manufactures printed circuit boards. In
addition Texmaco, an Indonesian-based man-made fabrics specialist, has also
announced it is to set up a plant.
The Benelux factory will be the first in Europe for the company, which makes
micro-cassettes, floppy disks and containers for audio and video cassettes.
Benelux employs 4,000 people in Hong Kong, China and Indonesia and sells its
products to customers such as Sony, Olympus and Philips.
Mr Gary Chow, Benelux chairman, said yesterday that the company had looked
at other European sites and had chosen Ulster primarily because of the
availability of 'easily trained people' and the presence of 24-hour
continuous working practices.
Financial incentives, he added, had also been an important factor. The
province offered 'an excellent bridgehead' for European and US markets.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Gummer rejects plan for county
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Gummer, environ-ment secretary, yesterday signalled that the
government will persist with plans to abolish the two-tier system of local
government in England by rejecting the Local Government Commission's plan to
leave the status quo intact in Gloucestershire.
He told Sir John Banham, the commission's chairman, to review the county's
structure again. Gloucestershire is the third county on which Mr Gummer has
asked the commission for a second opinion.
However, it is the first time Mr Gummer has rejected plans for a commission
proposal since January's High Court ruling that he had acted unlawfully in
telling the commission that he expected it to recommend all-purpose unitary
councils, rather than the status quo, in all but 'exceptional'
circumstances.
Mr Gummer said local residents should be given another chance to reach a
consensus. Sir John had already commented that he was 'unhappy' with the
proposals, and that local authorities had given 'no coherent lead to local
people'.
The county has received 1,300 submissions from interested parties, and
received responses to leaflets on the proposed changes from more than 30,000
local people. It found that in each of Gloucestershire's six districts the
status quo was the single most popular option.
The Association of District Councils, which supports unitary councils,
backed Mr Gummer's decision. It said local MPs had come out in favour of the
unitary case.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Invasion of privacy to be criminal offence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has decided to push ahead with new criminal offences covering
electronic eavesdropping and the use of long-range photography on private
property.
The offences, which will apply to everyone and not only the media, will be a
key part of a white paper on privacy expected to be published later this
month.
The offences, first suggested by the Calcutt committee on the press and
privacy, have been tacitly accepted by large sections of the press providing
they are not specifically aimed at the media and there will be a possible
defence of public interest.
The government seems to be increasingly wary of creating a right for
citizens to sue for breaches of privacy.
Apart from problems of definition, ministers such as Mr Peter Brooke, the
national heritage secretary, are understood to be concerned that without
legal aid - and the pressures on the legal aid system are already
considerable - only the rich would be able to protect their privacy.
The possibility of a civil tort of privacy will, it is believed, be retained
in the white paper as will the suggestion that there could be a statutory
ombudsman as a 'court of appeal' over the Press Complaints Commission, the
industry's self-regulating body.
The two proposed measures in the white paper are seen largely as a stick to
encourage the press to continue strengthening self-regulation.
There is little enthusiasm in the government for a statutory ombudsman, and
Lord McGregor, chairman of the commission, as well as other commission
members, have said they will resign if an ombudsman is imposed.
In November, after unauthorised pictures of the Princess of Wales were
printed in the Sunday and Daily Mirror, Mr Brooke warned, that the press had
to demonstrate that it could respect and abide by its own rules.
The appointment of Professor Robert Pinker, a PCC member, as privacy
commissioner to head investigations into unnecessary invasions of privacy
was seen as a step in the right direction.
It may decide to make the privacy commissioner more independent of the
complaints commission in return for dropping the proposals of a civil tort
and a statutory ombudsman.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Mixed picture on inflation prospects poses problem for
Clarke
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The old British problem of inflation will face Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor
of the exchequer, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, at
their monthly monetary meeting today.
At their last meeting they agreed a  1/4 percentage-point cut in base rates,
to coincide with the publication of the Bank of England's quarterly
inflation report. But when that report forecast that underlying inflation
would end 1995 at more than 3 per cent, in the top half of the government's
1 per cent to 4 per cent target range, and warned of an 'asymmetric' risk
that inflation might be even higher than that, analysts started to question
the authorities' judgment.
Since then falls in bond markets around the world have indicated that
investors are concerned about inflation. But analysts are divided on the
prospects for prices. Some argue that economic growth is too weak to prompt
inflation, especially with the impact of April's tax rises yet to be felt.
The headline rate of inflation - the annual rise in the retail prices index
 -was 2.5 per cent in in January compared with 1.9 per cent in December. But
this was a statistical quirk. When calculating an annual rate, the monthly
figure that falls out of the comparison is as important as the new figure.
In January 1993 a round of mortgage cuts caused the RPI to fall 0.9 per
cent. So even though the RPI fell 0.4 per cent in January 1994, the net
effect was a rise in the annual rate. The index has fallen in three of the
past four months and is only 0.1 per cent higher than its level last May.
This figure disguises sharp price falls in sectors such as clothing.
The underlying rate of inflation, which excludes mortgage movements, rose
only slightly from 2.7 per cent in December to 2.8 per cent in January,
mainly due to the effect of the Budget on excise duties.
It looks set to stay much closer to the headline rate because of the
disappearance of the effects of mortgage rate cuts after Black Wednesday.
The Bank of England is not looking at the past, however, but trying to
monitor price pressures two years ahead. The factors which will determine
future inflation depend, in part, on which economic school one believes. But
the main indicators are:
Money supply. M0 (mainly notes and coins) has been growing well outside its
zero to 4 per cent monitoring range but the government points to low
interest rates, which reduce the cost of holding cash, as the main reason.
Growth in M4 (broad money) is still at the low end of its 3 per cent to 9
per cent monitoring range.
Producer prices. Manufacturers' costs are still falling. Input prices fell
2.5 per cent in the 12 months to February, but output prices rose 3.7 per
cent over the same period, showing that manufacturers have been widening
margins.
Wage rises. The rate of growth in wages is much slower than when Britain
last emerged from recession in the early 1980s. Average earnings grew at
only 3 per cent in the year to December. But there is concern that recent
sharp falls in unemployment (January excepted), and the jump in headline
inflation, might cause the level of pay settlements to increase.
Commodities. The resurgence of enthusiasm for gold is cited by some,
including the US Federal Reserve, as an indicator of inflationary
expectations. But the price of oil remains subdued at about Dollars 13.50 a
barrel. It is hard to see much inflationary pressure in this area.
The immediate future for the headline rate is quite promising. In the months
about to drop out of the annual comparison - February and March 1993 - the
RPI rose 0.7 per cent and 0.4 per cent respectively.
The bigger unknown is April, when the index will gain from the lack of a
Budget, but will lose from the imposition of value added tax on fuel, the
restriction of tax relief on mortgages, and the dropping out of an April
1993 mortgage rate cut.
So the governor and the chancellor have a mixed picture to discuss. The
balance of inflationary indicators is probably positive but the reaction to
last month's base rate cut might persuade them that caution is needed.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Rebel Tory peers hail police bill climbdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rebel Conservative peers yesterday welcomed a climbdown on police reform by
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, removing the threat of a damaging defeat
in the Lords.
Mr Howard was forced to abandon the key elements of his proposals to remove
police authorities from the control of local councillors.
The climbdown is an embarrassment to Mr Howard, who faces criticism of the
criminal justice bill, the other important law-and-order measure announced
in the autumn. It is a further blow to Mr John Major's Back to Basics
campaign for traditional values, in which a crackdown on law and order is
prominent.
Lord Whitelaw, the former Conservative deputy prime minister who led
opposition to key elements, said the changes to the bill were 'of enormous
importance to our country'.
Lord Callaghan, former Labour prime minister, said the government had 'given
up the substance and kept the form' of the bill to avoid defeat. Lord
Jenkins of Hillhead, the former Labour home secretary who is now a Liberal
Democrat, said Mr Howard had 'mixed dogma and hubris with a reluctance to
consult and a determination to legislate at almost any price'.
The climbdown was announced by Earl Ferrers, the Home Office minister,
before the Lords resumed a line-by-line debate on the police and criminal
evidence bill.
He said the government would drop plans to remove the automatic majority
enjoyed by local authorities on police authorities, which at present consist
of two-thirds councillors and one-third magistrates.
He said most police authorities would have nine councillors, five Home
Office nominees and three magistrates.
The Home Office nominees will be chosen by selection panels consisting of
one member chosen by the home secretary, one chosen by councillors and
magistrates, and one chosen jointly.
The selection panels will produce a list of candidates from which the home
secretary will nominate five.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Major seeks to talk up economic prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major last night sought to talk up the prospects for sustained
economic recovery and pledged to hold down inflation, Philip Stephens in New
York writes.
The prime minister told executives at the British American Chambers of
Commerce in New York that the government had set in place 'solid foundations
for sustained growth throughout the 90s'.
Manufacturing productivity was rising by more than 5 per cent a year, labour
costs had fallen and the employment market was strengthening, he said.
Britain was again expecting the fastest growth rate among the main European
countries this year.
Mr Major said there had been a fundamental change in working practices which
had given Britain its lowest underlying inflation rate for a generation.
'The inflation psychology is, at last, in retreat. And I intend to keep it
that way.'
Emphasising that education remained at the top of his domestic political
agenda, the prime minister said that long-term competitiveness would depend
'above all on the quality, the ability, the skills of our workforce'.
Borrowing some of the recent political rhetoric of the Labour party, he
said: 'What we are working for is nothing less than the re-skilling of
Britain for the 21st century.'
In a sideswipe against Japan, he said that Britain and the US should work
together to open up Japan's markets to European and US competition.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Scottish Office to amend bill
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Scottish Office intends to amend the bill to reform local government,
now going through parliament, to enable Strathclyde Regional Council to
conclude a deal to lease Pounds 36m of trains for its passenger transport
executive.
The leasing of the trains, to be built by Hunslett TPL of Leeds, has been
held up since last autumn because Lombard North Central, the leasing
company, said there was inadequate security because Strathclyde is to be
broken into 10 councils under the reform.
The Scottish Office says it will seek to amend the legislation to permit the
council to lease the trains. Strathclyde believes a legally binding letter
stating this intention will be enough to unblock the deal. It says the
diesel multiple units should go into service by mid-1996.
Mr Malcolm Waugh, chairman of Strathclyde Regional Council's transport
committee, welcomed what he called a volte face by Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton, the Scottish Office minister.
He said, however, that the council would receive the trains 10 months later
than it might have done if Lord James had accepted what the council said in
the first place.

FT  02 MAR 94 / A million miles from Beirut: Michael Cassell meets one of a
growing contingent of overseas inward investors in Belfast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I thought I was heading for some place like Beirut,' insists Mr Tom
Johnson, who three years ago moved his family from sleepy Shelbyville,
Indiana, to the uncertain streets of Belfast. 'My preconceptions turned out
to be a million miles away from reality.'
Mr Johnson, managing director of Ryobi Aluminium Casting, a Japanese-owned
automotive castings manufacturer, is one of the small but growing number of
expatriate businessmen sent to Northern Ireland to manage companies. He
leaves shortly for another job in the US, where he will stoutly defend the
reputation of a place he says is damaged by distorted reporting and too
often viewed through a prism of ignorance.
He says: 'We've made good friends. My daughter has picked up the accent,
though I don't know how it will go down in South Carolina. We'll be back for
holidays and, for the rest of our lives, we'll be watching what happens
here.'
A posting to Ulster might not be at the top of many executives' gift list,
but Mr Johnson arrived with his wife and seven-year-old daughter during
Christmas 1990 to take charge of Ryobi's Pounds 16m investment. His company
had been drawn to the province by the prospect of lucrative contracts to
supply Ford of Germany and by a range of incentives arguably as attractive
as any in Europe.
Yesterday's announcement by Benelux adds another name to the register of
companies which have already decided that Northern Ireland's reputation as a
war-torn trouble spot is outweighed by its commercial advantages.
Estimates suggest that about 55,000 people in the province are directly
employed by overseas companies. In the past year alone inward investors have
created more than 1,600 jobs and, since last summer, foreign companies have
announced new investments worth more than Pounds 100m.
More are in the pipeline. A Taiwanese floppy-disk manufacturer is poised to
invest Pounds 13m in a new west Belfast factory while a Taiwanese textile
group wants to build a Pounds 160m plant that will involve the biggest
inward investment in the UK for five years. The UK is seeking European Union
approval for the deal, which could mean employment for 2,000 people.
The jobs are badly needed in a part of the UK with higher-than-average
unemployment and ghettos where the jobless outnumber those in work. When
Ryobi advertised for its first nine skilled operators, more than 150
qualified people applied.
Some US companies are investing in the province - particularly in and around
Londonderry - but many remain wary about putting money into what they see as
a high-risk commercial zone.
The pace is being set by Far East companies, which do not appear to be so
easily troubled by the province's international image. 'If you are a Seoul
businessmen, you are well used to having Sam missiles pointed at you,' says
one Belfast-based location consultant.
For Ryobi, the province beat several other European locations because of the
availability of highly skilled workers and a range of grants which provided
about 25 per cent of start-up costs. The highly automated plant in
Carrickfergus on the edge of Belfast employs 44 people and, given an
improvement in the European vehicle market, could eventually give work to
250.
Yet Mr Johnson's bosses from Japan still needed some persuading. 'They
approved all the figures but were understandably very nervous about the
political situation,' he says. 'Two board members came over and we drove
them around the best and the worst that Belfast has to offer. They realised
that, for most people in most places, life was no different to anywhere
else. We were told to go ahead.'
Ryobi, like other foreign investors, has not been touched by the Troubles
and stays out of politics.
As for Mr Johnson's own thoughts as he prepares to leave: 'I would not dare
suggest I know the answer and won't preach pessimism or optimism. I am sure
it will take some while to sort out. But there are so many good people here,
one day it must be solved.'

FT  02 MAR 94 / Treasury confirms 160,000 more pensioners to pay tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour claimed a success for its campaign on taxes last night when the
Treasury admitted that 160,000 pensioners have been brought into the tax net
by the freezing of personal allowances for the over-65s.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said in a Commons
written answer that the freezing of the allowances in the last two Budgets
would raise Pounds 140m.
Ms Harriet Harman, shadow Treasury chief secretary, said Mr Dorrell's
response revealed 'a very unfair Tory tax increase, and another broken Tory
promise'.
She added: 'This is going to hit people on very low occupational pensions
very hard. It will provoke anger and bitterness among people who will think
they are being penalised for having a small occupational pension.'
Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, said the freezing of
allowances was a 'back-door way of increasing income tax, hitting those
people least able to afford it'.
Mr Dorrell, who was answering a question from Mr Jeff Rooker, Labour MP for
Birmingham Perry Barr, said 200,000 elderly married couples on low incomes
would gain from changes to their allowances. He said the incomes of
pensioners receiving income support will have risen by at least 11 per cent
over the two years to April, when the Budget measures take effect.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Minister dismisses wider aid-for-arms allegations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Allegations that Britain's overseas aid programme was linked to arms deals
with several countries were dismissed as 'absolute nonsense' by Mr Alastair
Goodlad, Foreign Office minister of state, last night.
He told the Commons that its foreign affairs committee should be left to
deal with claims that a contract to sell Pounds 1bn of arms to Malaysia was
won because the UK gave Pounds 234m aid for building the Pergau
hydro-electric dam.
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, is due to give evidence to the committee
today.
Sir David Steel, foreign affairs spokesman for the Liberal Democrats,
highlighted the role of Baroness Thatcher, when prime minister, in seeking
to expand British trade with Malaysia.
He said her 'close circle' had been involved. 'In this case Sir Tim Bell,
well known as her public relations adviser, is also adviser to the Malaysian
prime minister and to Tan Sri Armugam, who controls GEC Malaysia, heavily
involved in several of the contracts under the deal.'
A Liberal Democrat motion asserting that the Pergau dam allegations had
'seriously undermined the credibility of the British aid programme' was
defeated by a government majority of 146 (305-159).
Mr Goodlad also condemned suggestions that British companies which
contributed to Conservative party funds had been the main beneficiaries of
contracts arising from overseas aid and trade deals.
Mr Tom Clarke, shadow minister for overseas aid, accused Mr Goodlad of
attempting to deal with the Pergau dam issue almost as an aside.
Mr Richard Needham, the trade minister, said only 1.2 per cent of the aid
budget would be allocated to the dam in any single year.
He warned that the 'distortions of some sections of the press' and the
attacks made by opposition MPs on Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand could put
jobs at risk.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Rover displaces Ford at top of motor league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rover Group, whose sale to BMW of Germany is expected to be approved by
British Aerospace shareholders on March 15, was the UK's biggest vehicle
maker last year - a status it lost to Ford more than a decade ago.
Statistics from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show Rover as
the biggest producer even when Ford's commercial vehicle output is included.
However, the US multi-national's production exceeded Rover's by about 2,000
units if the figure for Jaguar, now a Ford subsidiary, is included.
The figures, which show that UK car production reached its highest for 20
years, emerged on the day that Ford announced that short-time working had
ended at its Transit van plant at Southampton and that output of Escorts
from its Halewood plant was being increased.
This year Ford should close the gap on Rover, whose output of cars and
leisure/utility four-wheel-drive vehicles rose 7.39 per cent last year to
408,804 from 378,797 in 1992.
Although Rover's output of vehicles classified as light commercial is
confined to some Land Rover models and a few Maestro vans, the 19,940 it
produced last year lifted its output to 426,744. This moved it well clear of
the 398,858 cars and vans produced by Ford itself, although Jaguar added a
further 29,587 units to Ford's tally.
Rover has led Ford in car output for some time but until last year Ford's
commercial vehicle output kept it ahead.
Last year the commercial vehicle industry suffered its worst for output
since 1948.
Total car output last year continued on its rising trend, up 6.47 per cent
to 1,375,524 units, the highest since 1974. This was in spite of lower
output at Vauxhall and Peugeot.
The main factor in the increase, apart from Rover, was higher output from
Nissan's Sunderland plant and the start of production at the Toyota and
Honda plants.

FT  02 MAR 94 / House prices 'rose by 2% in February'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Halifax Building Society, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, is expected to
announce tomorrow that house prices rose by more than 2 per cent last month
compared with January.
The rise would be one of the largest monthly increases reported by the
society since the late 1980s and would lift the annual increase in house
prices to about 3 per cent.
The Halifax figures conflict with a report yesterday by Nationwide, the
country's second-largest building society, which said UK house prices on
average had fallen by 0.6 per cent in February compared with January.
The annual rise in house prices of 3.2 per cent reported by the Nationwide,
however, was very close to the figure expected to be published by Halifax.
Halifax and Nationwide both expect prices to rise by about 5 per cent on
average this year, although their monthly figures have differed widely.
Halifax in January and December reported monthly price falls of 0.4 per cent
and 0.6 per cent respectively while Nationwide reported increases of 0.4 per
cent and 0.8 per cent.
Some of the monthly discrepancies between the societies' figures may be
explained by the fact that Nationwide uses a smaller sample of borrowers,
while Halifax also seasonally adjusts its figures.
Halifax is likely to warn that the slow nature of the housing recovery is
such that it is difficult to gain a true picture of the market from one
month's figures. It has warned that occasional monthly price falls may still
occur even though the general trend in prices and sales is upwards.
Mr Brian Davis, Nationwide's operations director, said price falls had also
occurred in February last year and in 1992.
He expected the 'continued small annual rise in house prices apparent since
the autumn' to continue. In spite of tax increases scheduled to take effect
in April, there was 'still potential for a sustained rise in housing market
transactions in 1994'.
Mr Davis said: 'Although the tax increases due in April may not be helpful
to the housing market and wider economy, the current low interest rate
environment has significantly contributed to improved affordability.'

FT  02 MAR 94 / N-waste delays pose 'safety threat'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Workers handling radioactive waste at sites owned by the Atomic Energy
Authority could suffer additional doses of radiation because of delays in
constructing a permanent repository for nuclear waste in the UK, a nuclear
safety study group said yesterday.
The group, set up by the Health and Safety Executive's nuclear safety
committee, said the sites were running out of storage space.
The group's report, however, concludes that the AEA, the body charged with
leading the development of the nuclear power industry, is aware of these
problems and is dealing with them. The authority said it accepted the
findings and was addressing the problems.
The report says that at Sellafield in Cumbria there are still problems after
a fire in 1952.
Yesterday's findings do not directly affect plans to privatise the
authority. The division responsible for managing and decommissioning
redundant plant will remain in government hands.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Colleges claim victory in dispute

<TEXT>
Further education college employers yesterday claimed victory in their
dispute with the Natfhe lecturers' union over new contracts, after the union
announced it was abandoning national negotiations in favour of local
bargaining, John Authers writes.
About 100 Natfhe members who disobeyed union orders yesterday by holding
unofficial strikes, also face possible damages and disciplinary action from
college principals.
The Court of Appeal last week ruled that Natfhe's national strike called for
yesterday was unlawful because college principals had not been given names
of all the union members balloted.
Lecturers are in dispute with the Colleges' Employers' Forum over new
contracts which would halve their annual holiday leave and add an hour to
the working day.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Reforms at TUC win wide backing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, was joined by other political parties,
employers' organisations and industry leaders in welcoming the Trades Union
Congress's announcement yesterday of a 'relaunch' of its aims.
The TUC said it wanted to broaden its links and exert influence across the
political spectrum and not just inside the Labour party.
Mr Hunt said he saw the modernisation as 'a welcome and necessary step if
unions are to market their services to their individual members more
effectively in the workplace and help employers to become more competitive'.
Mr John Smith, Labour leader, acknowledged that 'the TUC . . . should have
the widest possible influence'.
Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, said the congress wanted to 'signal
that we want to work as partners with employers who will work with us to
maximise job and income security'.
Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the CBI, said he believed the new
approach would 'help to develop even better understanding between employers
and unions'.
Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of ICI, said: 'It is important the TUC should
be able to function efficiently and effectively.'

FT  02 MAR 94 / Chambers attack insolvency laws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conflicts of interest which could arise when accountants investigating
companies are then appointed as its receivers should be examined by the
government, says the British Chambers of Commerce.
The government should also consider the scope for establishing an
independent watchdog to protect creditors' rights and oversee the sale of
any assets by receivers back to the directors of an insolvent company.
A document prepared by the Mid-Yorkshire Chamber of Commerce and Industry,
which is to be circulated to other member bodies across the country today,
is the latest in a series of attacks on insolvency law.
It substantially extends the scope of reform proposed in a consultative
report issued by the Department of Trade and Industry last year. The DTI
suggested reforms to Company Voluntary Arrangements, an insolvency procedure
introduced in 1986 and widely criticised for its lack of effectiveness.
Mr Richard Brown, deputy director-general of the British chambers, said:
'Insolvency law is not something people lie dreaming about, but we have
identified what we believe to be some quite serious flaws in legislation.'
The chambers' document is expected to call for discussion of whether there
should be a clearer division of roles when banks which appoint accountants
to investigate the affairs of a company also appoint that firm as receivers.
It stresses that it has not discovered any evidence of accountants
recommending that a business be put into insolvency to generate more work.
It argues, however, that there is conflict between the interests of the bank
or other secured creditors and the interests of other creditors and
management.
It says there is concern among creditors about the sale of assets back to
directors of insolvent companies. There is also concern for greater
vigilance of fraud.
The document argues for greater flexibility by government collection
agencies such as the Inland Revenue, which are often the creditors that
trigger company insolvencies because they have little discretion to make
com-mercial judgments about a company.
In line with a highly critical report from the National Audit Office last
year, it urges the DTI to actively prosecute, disqualify and debar directors
where there are concerns about their conduct.
It calls for simplification of administration, another procedure introduced
in 1986. It says the courts should be bypassed and the decision of whether
to grant an administration order handed to insolvency practitioners.
It also argues for modifications to company voluntary arrangements so that
they are no longer linked to administration orders.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Number of companies entering receivership jumps
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of companies entering receivership or administration jumped by
more than 50 per cent to 248 last month, according to figures from the
official London and Edinburgh Gazettes analysed by accountants Touche Ross.
The total for the first two months of the year was 411, compared with 772
for the same period last year.
Mr Christopher Morris, head of insolvency at Touche, said the monthly rise
might have been exceptional but possibly suggested that bankers were
starting to worry about the chances of their customers being able to trade
successfully out of recession.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Major seeks to stress prospects for recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major last night sought to talk up the prospects for sustained
economic recovery and pledged to hold down inflation.
Speaking to executives at the British American Chambers of Commerce in New
York, the prime minister said the government had set in place 'solid
foundations for sustained growth throughout the 90s'.
Seeking to dispel any impression in the US that the recovery might be in
doubt, he said the end of the recession had left Britain in a much stronger
competitive position.
Manufacturing productivity was rising by more than 5 per cent a year, labour
costs had fallen and the employment market was strengthening. Britain was
again expecting the fastest growth rate among the main European countries in
1994.
Mr Major said there had been a fundamental change in working practices which
had given Britain its lowest underlying inflation rate for a generation.
'The inflation psychology is, at last, in retreat. And I intend to keep it
that way.'
He added that low inflation was creating its own dynamic for investment and
growth. But the government was determined to move further in sharpening
Britain's competitive edge. Emphasising that education remains at the top of
his domestic political agenda, the prime minister said that long-term
competitiveness would depend 'above all on the quality, the ability, the
skills of our workforce'.
Borrowing some of the recent political rhetoric of the Labour party, he
said: 'What we are working for is nothing less than the reskilling of
Britain for the 21st century.'
Stressing Britain's commitment to free and open trade, Mr Major said that
the industrialised nations could not insulate old industries and old habits
from global competition.
In a sideswipe against Japan, he said that Britain and the US should work
together to open up Japan's markets to European and US competition.

Sandwell borough in the West Midlands is setting up an economic forum to

FT  02 MAR 94 / British Coal faces clash with watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Coal ceased pumping operations yesterday at the disused Horden pit
in County Durham, saving Pounds 1m a year and ending water pumping at the
county's former coastal pits, Chris Tighe writes.
British Coal said it intended a gradual shutdown of most remaining pumping
stations in County Durham - a policy which could put it on a collision
course with the National Rivers Authority, the pollution watchdog. British
Coal said it envisaged a gradual cut in the number of stations without any
environmental consequences.
The NRA warned only last month that minewater pumping in the central Durham
coalfield must continue to prevent a serious pollution threat to the river
Wear. Yesterday it repeated it would not agree to more pumping reductions
unless British Coal could satisfy it that there would be no increased risk
of pollution.
Workers at the Tursdale mine service centre in County Durham voted yesterday
to accept closure. Tursdale and Bestwood in Nottinghamshire, British Coal's
last two mine workshops, will close on Friday with a loss of 467 jobs.

FT  02 MAR 94 / N-waste delays pose threat to safety'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Workers handling radioactive waste at sites owned by the Atomic Energy
Authority could suffer additional doses of radiation because of delays in
constructing a permanent repository for nuclear waste in the UK, a nuclear
safety study group said yesterday.
The group, set up by the Health and Safety Executive's nuclear safety
committee, said the sites were running out of storage space.
The group's report, however, concludes that the authority is aware of these
problems and is dealing with them. The authority said it accepted the
findings, and was addressing the specific problems identified.
The report says that at Sellafield in Cumbria there are still serious
problems left over from a fire in 1952. At Dounreay in the Highlands, where
the prototype of a fast breeder reactor is being decommissioned, waste
storage is 'very much of a hand-to-mouth existence'.
It also says the delay in the repository programme and in a new agreement on
packaging specifications for nuclear waste were preventing the more secure
storage of waste.
Yesterday's findings do not directly affect plans to privatise the Atomic
Energy Authority. The division responsible for managing and decommissioning
redundant plant will remain in government hands.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Dinosaurs aid rise in cinema audiences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The success of films such as Jurassic Park helped to encourage large
increases in cinema attendances last year, according to research for the
11th annual survey of the industry.
The research for the Cinema Advertising Association found that 69 per cent
of those aged over seven said that they visited the cinema, the highest
proportion in recent history and an increase of 4m on the previous year.
The number of people visiting the cinema regularly, defined as once a month
or more, increased from 11 per cent of the population to 14 per cent. This
accounted for a total of 7.139m visits last year, a rise of 28 per cent
compared with 1992.
According to the survey, carried out by BMRB International, the four most
popular films were Jurassic Park with 14.2m viewers; The Bodyguard, 7.2m;
Home Alone 2, 6.1m; and Sister Act, 5.4m. Jurassic Park set a modern record
with an audience 3m higher than the film ET in 1983.
The survey shows that 24 films were seen by more than 2m people, compared
with 21 in 1992 and 14 in 1990.
More than 40 per cent of cinema visits in the two months prior to the
research, carried out in October and November, were to the 66 multiplex
cinemas in the UK - all of which opened in the past nine years.
The survey also suggests that 85 per cent of those aged over seven have a
video recorder in the home and that, on a monthly basis, 70 per cent watched
programmes recorded from television and 16 per cent from satellite. Some 39
per cent watched hired videos.

FT  02 MAR 94 / BR goods managers hope to buy Freightliner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Managers in British Rail's freight division yesterday announced plans to buy
out its loss-making Freightliner business.
Freightliner, which transports containers from British ports to inland rail
terminals, is expected to be one of the first parts of BR's freight
operations to be privatised. Several companies have expressed an interest.
The value of bids for Freightliner will depend in part on the value which BR
puts on its assets in an information memorandum to be published later this
month. It will also depend on the level of charges levied by Railtrack,
which will take over ownership of BR's track and signalling from April 1.
Freightliner's financial performance has been poor, however, with estimated
losses of Pounds 30m on turnover of Pounds 75m a year.
Freightliner, the domestic arm of BR's Railfreight Distribution arm, carries
500,000 containers a year for deep-sea shipping lines serving UK ports.
Railfreight Distribution's international business does not form part of this
privatisation, but will be sold off later.
The five-strong buy-out team is headed by Mr David Rutherford, finance
director of Railfreight Distribution and formerly with Plessey, the
electronics group. The managers plan to involve other employees in the
buy-out.
Mr Bill Shiplee, commercial director of Railfreight Distribution and a
member of the buy-out team, emphasised that its plan would not lead to a
break-up of Freightliner's operations. It intends to own and operate its own
locomotives and rolling stock.
Hambros merchant bank is adviser to the buy-out team.
Rival bids for Freightliner have been announced by Russell Davies, a
container services and distribution group, jointly with P&amp;O Distribution,
part of the quoted shipping company, and by a consortium of British ports.
The Scottish Office intends to amend the bill to reform local government to
enable Strathclyde Regional Council to conclude a deal to lease Pounds 36m
of trains for its passenger transport executive. The leasing has been held
up since last autumn because Lombard North Central, the leasing company,
feared inadequate security because Strathclyde is to be broken into 10
councils.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Attorney-general fights pressure to resign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, IVOR OWEN, ROLAND RUDD and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Nicholas Lyell was last night fighting growing pressure to quit as
attorney-general last night as Downing Street offered strong support and
Conservative MPs attacked Mr Michael Heseltine's evidence to the Scott
inquiry.
Some Tory backbenchers said Mr Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary,
had 'gone over the top' in accusing Sir Nicholas of giving contradictory
advice about his duty to sign public interest immunity certificates.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, demanded Sir Nicholas's
resignation during rowdy exchanges in the Commons over the government's
involvement in the Matrix Churchill case, which collapsed after the judge
accepted that the government had known about illegal arms deals.
Mrs Beckett said Sir Nicholas's position was becoming 'increasingly
untenable' as other ministers sought to 'save their own skins' by making him
the scapegoat for the collapse of the trial.
'What sticks in the throat of the British public is that having secretly
sold arms to Saddam Hussein which were used against British troops,
ministers were prepared to see innocent men go to jail to cover up their
conspiracy,' she said.
Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons, who was standing in for the prime
minister at question time, said Mr Heseltine had been advised 'quite
properly' by the attorney-general.
Downing Street also offered strong support to Sir Nicholas. He was said to
have the 'full confidence' of Mr John Major, the prime minister, who is on a
visit to the US.
But the government's attempt to rally support for Sir Nicholas was
undermined by Mr Major, who refused to comment until he had seen a
transcript of Mr Heseltine's evidence.
Conservative MPs said Sir Nicholas had been undermined by the evidence, but
was unlikely to be forced to resign before Lord Justice Scott reports in the
summer.
But there was also widespread support for Mr Heseltine's disclosure that he
resisted pressure to sign certificates because he feared that vital evidence
in the Matrix Churchill arms for Iraq trial would be suppressed.
Friends of Sir Nicholas said he was convinced he would be cleared by Lord
Justice Scott, and was determined to resist resignation unless he was
strongly criticised in the judge's final report.
Sir Nicholas is expected to mount a strong defence of his advice to Mr
Heseltine when he gives evidence to the inquiry on March 24.
Some ministers would like Sir Nicholas to appear earlier, in order to limit
the damage caused by Mr Heseltine's comments, but his appearance is unlikely
to be brought forward.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Ex-DTI legal adviser faces Scott today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The legal position of the government in the arms-for-Iraq affair will come
under fresh scrutiny today when Mr Gerald Hosker QC gives evidence to the
Scott inquiry.
Mr Hosker was chief legal adviser to the Department of Trade and Industry
from 1987 to 1992, a crucial period which has the Matrix Churchill case at
its core.
He was then promoted to Treasury solicitor, where he has acted as chief
legal adviser to all government law officers and assisted Sir Nicholas
Lyell, the attorney-general.
He was a government legal adviser in the period when Customs prosecuted
three executives of the Matrix Churchill machine-tool company for exporting
arms-related machinery to Iraq, and when ministers signed public-interest
immunity certificates seeking to withhold from the courts information that
those executives were working for British intelligence and with the
knowledge of ministers.
Mr Hosker comes before Lord Justice Scott two days after Mr Michael
Heseltine told the inquiry of his fears that attempts to withhold Whitehall
documents from the Matrix Churchill trial would fuel suspicions of a
cover-up.
Two weeks ago Mr Hosker's assistant, Mr Andrew Leithead, admitted to the
inquiry that government lawyers had doctored official papers crucial to the
acquittal of the Matrix Churchill executives.
Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, is not scheduled to give evidence
to the Scott inquiry until March 24, so it falls to Mr Hosker to try to
convince Lord Justice Scott that the Matrix Churchill prosecution
represented, in Sir Nicholas's words, a 'careful application of
well-established procedures designed to ensure the proper balancing by the
court of competing public interests and thus the administration of justice'.
Ministers giving evidence to the inquiry have been unable to strike a common
position on what they considered their role and duty to be in signing PII
certificates.
Mr Heseltine told the inquiry that he had signed the certificate extremely
reluctantly after being told by Sir Nicholas that it was his duty. But
following the Matrix Churchill trial the minister said he had been advised
'there was not a duty in every case to claim PII'.
Other ministers who signed PII certificates - Mr Malcolm Rifkind, Mr Tristan
Garel-Jones, Mr Peter Lilley and Mr Kenneth Clarke - said they did so
because they considered it their duty.
Even Mr Clarke, who told the Scott inquiry he felt some degree of discretion
in signing PII certificates as a minister, signed his unflinchingly during
the Matrix Churchill trial.
Mr Clarke's justification for non-disclosure was not challenged by the
Matrix Churchill defence counsel. What remains more controversial is the
decision by Mr Rifkind and Mr Garel-Jones to use in their PIIs the phrase
'injurious to the public interest' to describe documents which were of
relevance to the defence.

FT  02 MAR 94 / MPs call for survey of civil service morale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A committee of MPs has called on the government to ask civil servants to see
if changes in the civil service have damaged morale or weakened the
public-service ethos.
The Treasury and civil service committee has asked the Cabinet Office to
conduct the survey as part of its probe of the role of the civil service.
Mr William Waldegrave, the public service minister, is believed to be
sympathetic to the idea.
In the light of evidence in the arms-for-Iraq inquiry the committee is
considering whether a statutory code of ethics is needed to protect civil
servants who are asked by ministers to behave unethically or mislead
parliament.
The First Division Association, the union for top civil servants, yesterday
presented a draft code of ethics to the committee. The association called
for an independent appeal body for civil servants faced with ethical
dilemmas.
The new civil service ethics tribunal would be able to examine such dilemmas
confidentially. Consisting of three privy councillors, senior politicians
drawn from across the political spectrum, it would also have the power to
force instructions to be withdrawn if they were ruled unethical.
Ms Elizabeth Symons, the association's general secretary, told the committee
that the code should defend three fundamental principles: The accountability
of civil servants to parliament - in most cases through ministers.
The impartiality and political neutrality of the civil service.
The appointment of civil servants through free and open competition rather
than political patronage.
Ms Symons said the arms-for-Iraq inquiry had revealed confusion over the
relationship between ministers, civil servants and parliament.
She said: 'The code would inform ministers, civil servants, members of
parliament and the public about what that relationship should be.'
At present civil servants have a duty to report financial irregularities to
their superiors, she said. A similar duty should be imposed for unethical
instructions.

Mr John Major, the prime minister, has ordered an inquiry into the cost
implications of introducing nursery provision for all children under the age
of five.
Mr Eric Forth, junior education minister, told the Commons last night that
whether or not attendance should be mandatory or optional, and whether the
teachers involved should be graduates were among issues being considered.
He suggested that the cost of making the fullest possible provision would be
in the region of Pounds 1bn a year.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Lilley acts on housing benefit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is considering a crackdown on housing benefits, the third
largest item in the social security budget, which cost nearly Pounds 9bn a
year.
Proposals being drawn up for Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary,
would tighten the definition of 'reasonable rents' which local authorities
are required to pay.
The scheme, which has not been given final approval, could mean that some
poor families would have to move to cheaper accommodation.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Eight pits under lease to reopen
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Private-sector companies are to reopen up to eight of the 28 collieries
which have been offered for leasing by British Coal in the past year.
Final hopes for resuming mining at two pits died yesterday when British Coal
said there had been no bids for Frickley in South Yorkshire and Littleton in
Staffordshire.
The corporation said it had received tenders from companies wishing to
operate Hatfield, South Yorkshire, and Silverdale, Staffordshire, the other
pits in the last batch of four which were put to tender.
Clipstone in Nottinghamshire has been handed to RJB Mining. Negotiations
continue on granting licences for Betws, south Wales, to a buy-out team, and
for Rossington and Markham Main in the Yorkshire area to RJB Mining and Coal
Investments respectively.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Auditor's inquiry at Westminster council may be widened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The residents of Westminster who first called on the district auditor to
investigate the council's alleged 'gerrymandering' policy have met him again
to discuss how separate allegations not included in his original public
report should be handled, John Authers writes.
The auditor has already provisionally recommended that five Conservative
councillors and four council officers should be surcharged Pounds 21.5m
following their involvement in the council's policy of 'designated sales' of
council housing in politically marginal wards.
Mr Neale Coleman, a former Labour member of the council and co-ordinator of
the objectors to the council's policy, said last night that the scandal went
'far beyond homes for votes'.
He said: 'When we got the auditor's report, we the complainants also
received more than 6,000 pages of documents. These reveal on inspection that
the gerrymandering went far beyond homes for votes.'
The further allegations cover land disposals, disposals of property and
planning decisions according to Mr Coleman. He added: 'We have asked the
district auditor for assurances that he will be addressing these issues.'

FT  02 MAR 94 / Gould may be forced to quit early
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bryan Gould was yesterday under mounting pressure to stand down early as
an MP after the death of Mr Ron Leighton, his Euro-sceptic Labour colleague,
raised the prospect of by-elections in three neighbouring east London
constituencies.
Mr Gould announced last month that he was quitting politics to return to his
native New Zealand. He said he would resign his seat in Dagenham with effect
from September 1.
But the necessity for a further by-election is understood to have increased
the desire of some in the Labour leadership to force Mr Gould to step down
sooner.
Mr Gould appears determined to resist such pressure.
The third by-election will be in Barking, a seat held for 20 years by Ms Jo
Richardson, who died last month.
Mr Leighton, 64, a former chairman of the Commons employment committee, died
on Monday night of natural causes.
A printer, he was brought into politics by his fierce opposition to the
Common Market, acting as national organiser for the No campaign in the 1975
referendum.
Four years later he won Newham North East.
He consistently backed Mrs Margaret Thatcher in her battles with Britain's
European partners to reduce Britain's budget contributions.
Mr Smith paid tribute to Mr Leighton yesterday, saying he 'fought his corner
passionately and sincerely but always with tolerance and respect for those
who disagreed with him'.
Mr Denis MacShane, a veteran trade unionist, is to be Labour's candidate for
the Rotherham by-election caused by the death of Mr James Boyce. Labour had
a 17,561 majority at the last election.

The Trades Union Congress wants to broaden its links and exert influence

That was the main message yesterday from Mr John Monks, TUC general
secretary since September, in his 'relaunch' of the organisation.
Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, said that he saw the organisation's
modernisation as 'a welcome and necessary step if unions are to market their
services to their individual members more effectively in the workplace and
help employers to become more competitive'.

Further education college employers yesterday declared victory in their

About 100 Natfhe members who disobeyed union orders and held unofficial

The Court of Appeal last week ruled that Natfhe's strike, called for
yesterday, was unlawful because principals had not been given the names of
members balloted.

<TEXT>
The Sunday Times is launching its own Visa card, claiming to be the first
newspaper in the world to do so.
The scheme will be administered by North West Securities, part of the Bank
of Scotland, and offered to the paper's 3.7m readers this Sunday.
Each copy of the paper will carry a temporary plastic privilege card valid
for six weeks. This will offer discounts on a range of goods and services.
Readers can apply for a permanent privilege card or the full Visa card,
which has an annualised percentage rate of 18.9 per cent (20.7 per cent for
cash advances).
Holders are also offered legal assistance, free personal accident insurance
and a facility to take over any existing credit card balance. Using the card
earns points to receive the Sunday Times free for up to a year. Cardholders
who spend Pounds 300 will get the paper free for 12 weeks.
The offer follows the extensive publicity given to the credit card launch by
GM, the car manufacturer.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Conflict alleged on tendering rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday sought to end confusion over its new private
finance guidelines after they appeared to be questioned by a leading civil
servant.
Mr Mark Lambirth, head of the Department of Transport's finance division,
said it would be 'pretty unusual' for his department to award a contract
without competitive tendering.
'Imagine the outcry,' he told an Institute of Directors' conference on
private finance, if ministers gave a particular company a clear run at
building a project such as the channel tunnel or the London CrossRail line.
Earlier, Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, told the
conference the government would award contracts in certain cases without
putting them out to tender.
Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive of Wimpey, the construction group, said:
'There appears to be a conflict between the Treasury, which wants to get the
scheme off the ground, and the users' departments which are suspicious of
doing it.'
The competition guidelines have been changed to meet the concerns of
companies which have complained that it is unfair to produce an original
idea only to see another company win the contract.
Under the guidelines announced by Mr Dorrell, a contract will not be put out
to public tender if 'advantages of stimulating innovation justify an
alternative approach'.
Other senior executives attending yesterday's conference underlined Mr
Dwyer's concern that civil servants may continue to work under the old
rules.
Mr Dorrell later said he was 'slightly surprised' at the line taken by Mr
Lambirth. 'It is possible to conceive of circumstances where it might arise
in Transport that a contract is awarded without competitive tendering,' he
said.
He encouraged companies to use the Treasury document, containing the new
guidelines, when bidding for a contract. 'It amounts to a code of practice
for departments to follow in taking projects forward,' he said.
The government also confirmed that guidelines specify that departments
should say clearly what they want from a project.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Limelight strikes usually low profile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Sir Nicholas Lyell gives evidence to the Scott inquiry later this
month, it will be the stiffest challenge so far in a testing year for the
government's quintessentially patrician senior legal adviser.
Appointed attorney-general after the last general election two years ago,
the Mid Bedfordshire MP kept a pretty low profile until last February.
Then the Maastricht soap opera intervened.
His unexpected advice that the government could ratify Maastricht even if
was defeated in parliament on the treaty's social chapter helped get
ministers out of a fix - at the cost of the embarrassing admission that an
interpretation by Foreign Office lawyers had been mistaken.
It also thrust Sir Nicholas - who has spent 14 of his 15 years as an MP as a
law officer or a law officer's assistant - into the limelight.
In particular, the episode revived questions over whether it is any longer
appropriate to have someone elected on a party label who is also on hand to
provide crucial legal advice.
Some four months later, his name hit the headlines again in connection with
the Asil Nadir affair, which precipitated the resignation of Mr Michael
Mates, the former Northern Ireland minister.
This time, Sir Nicholas's task was to pour cold water over MPs excited by Mr
Mates's extraordinary attack on the Serious Fraud Office - a role for which
his calm, sometimes stilted, public demeanour made him ideally suited.
His performance backfired in December, when he was forced to admit that one
of Mr Mates's key allegations against the SFO was justified. The admission
left him open to the charge that he had misled the Commons over the affair
in his original statement.
Sir Nicholas's present post is the culmination of a steady but unspectacular
ascent beginning in 1979 with seven years as parliamentary private secretary
to the attorney-general.
Conspiracy theorists note that this period included Westland, the imbroglio
which triggered the resignation from cabinet of Mr Michael Heseltine, his
current tormentor.
This is not the first time Sir Nicholas's resignation has been called for:
in 1989, Lord Rawlinson, a former attorney-general, urged him to resign as
solicitor-general over Lord Mackay's legal reforms.
Though some feel he is acquiring an accident-prone reputation, Sir Nicholas
 -a Lloyd's Name with membership of many syndicates - will probably react to
this latest question mark over his career with customary sang froid.

FT  02 MAR 94 / US and UK affirm unity on policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister John Major put aside past
differences over Bosnia yesterday and announced broad agreement on a range
of foreign policy issues as the US leader reaffirmed the 'breadth and depth'
of the transatlantic relationship.
After talks in Pittsburgh and Washington they agreed to bolster support for
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and to launch an initiative to speed
implementation of last year's Gatt world trade agreement. Mr Clinton offered
strong support for British policy in Hong Kong and carefully sidestepped
questions over the visit to the US last month of Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn
Fein leader.
To underline the rapprochement over Bosnia, the two leaders announced they
would be sending a joint civil engineering team to Sarajevo to hasten
efforts to restore normality to the city. The two governments will approach
international financial institutions and seek resources to restore water,
power and health services in the Bosnian capital.
After their discussions Mr Clinton said London and Washington had agreed
also on the need to bolster Mr Yeltsin's pursuit of reform in Russia, boost
Russian ties with the west, and strengthen Nato's Partnership for Peace
programme with the former Communist bloc.
Speaking on the White House lawn after what both sides were at pains to
emphasise had been harmonious meetings, Mr Clinton once again affirmed the
strength of the 'special relationship'.  He said that by focusing on
occasional problems, such as Bosnia and Ireland, observers had
underestimated 'the incredible breadth and depth of our shared interests'.
Mr Major responded by saying that the Anglo-American alliance was
underpinned by 'shared interests and shared instincts' on virtually all the
big issues facing the west.
To reinforce the point, Mr Clinton offered support for Britain in its
dispute with China over democratic reform in Hong Kong. He expressed
admiration for Governor Chris Patten's efforts towards 'a genuine long-term
strategy for economic and political success' in the colony.
Mr Major signalled his hope that agreement with Mr Clinton on the joint
approach to Bosnia would defuse the most explosive issue in often difficult
relations between London and Washington over the past year. He said active
US involvement in the search for an overall settlement between Bosnia's
warring parties meant 'our policy is heading exactly in the same direction'.
Mr Clinton indicated the US remained determined not to send US troops to
Bosnia until there was a comprehensive political settlement, but said Nato's
success in relieving Sarajevo had created 'a terrific opportunity to build
on'.
The two leaders will seek to bring forward to January 1995 implementation of
the accords reached in the Uruguay Round. Under present plans these would
not come into force until the middle of next year.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Argentina wins loan of Dollars 509m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The World Bank board yesterday approved a loan of Dollars 508.5m (Pounds
348.2m) for an innovative project to develop Argentina's capital markets.
The Washington-based development institution agreed to lend Dollars 500m for
a 'backstop' facility that will guarantee Argentina's commercial banks a
source of liquidity if interest rates rise in the future, and will thus
encourage them to lend money for longer periods to small and medium-sized
businesses.
The backstop fund will be owned by the Argentine government and managed by
an internationally recognised financial institution. It will undertake to
buy bonds from the commercial banks if interest rates rise beyond a fixed
level, to allow them to refinance loans made for periods longer than six
years.
The hope is that the facility will help strengthen the balance sheets of the
top 15 or 20 Argentine banks if interest rates turn upwards.
Argentina is one of the World Bank's biggest borrowers, with loans totalling
Dollars 3.6bn since the current government took office in 1989.

Futures trading losses totalling Dollars 206m (Pounds 141m) at Codelco,
Chile's state copper company, will not affect the country's 1994 budget,
according to Mr Alejandro Foxley, the outgoing finance minister.
Mr Foxley, testifying before a parliamentary commission investigating the
losses, which amount to nearly 0.5 per cent of GDP, said the deficit would
be met through a combination of last year's budget surplus and extra
revenues from Codelco.
Codelco would be able to provide the Treasury with an extra Dollars 61m
because of higher production and lower costs than envisaged in the 1993
budget, Mr Foxley said. The remaining Dollars 145m would come from the
budget surplus of Dollars 790m.
The losses had been particularly painful, Mr Foxley said, as he had devoted
the past four years to saving money to improve the country's fiscal
position. As a member of Codelco's board Mr Foxley has been the target of
opposition attack over the scandal. He said he had not known Codelco was
speculating.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Quebec separatist election defeat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL, TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The separatist Parti Quebecois has suffered a surprise setback with its
first by-election loss in five years in Canada. The victory by Quebec's
ruling Liberal party in the largely French-speaking Shefford constituency,
east of Montreal, gives an unexpected fillip to Mr Daniel Johnson, the
provincial premier, ahead of provincial elections this year.
Mr Johnson, who took over from Mr Robert Bourassa last January, is strongly
committed to retaining - if not strengthening - Quebec's ties to the rest of
Canada.
Until a few weeks ago a PQ victory in the forthcoming election seemed all
but assured. The separatist party has promised to hold an independence
referendum within 12 months of taking office.
An opinion poll published yesterday also suggested support for the
separatists might be waning. According to the poll, conducted by the Angus
Reid group, backing for the PQ's federal counterparts, the Bloc Quebecois,
has dropped to 38 per cent of decided voters, compared to 49 per cent at
last October's general election.
However, the mood remains volatile. Last week the Liberals lost a
by-election in a constituency they had held for 37 years. Opinion polls
suggest almost a third of Quebecois remain undecided.
This week's victory gives backbone to Mr Johnson's efforts to bring
aggressive leadership to the Quebec Liberals after two years of indecision
caused by the illness of Mr Bourassa.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Bentsen firm on banking rules reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, yesterday refused to back down in
the face of Federal Reserve Board criticism and insisted that the four
overlapping federal bank regulatory agencies must be consolidated.
Mr Bentsen offered to let the Fed - which currently supervises bank holding
companies, foreign banks, and state-chartered banks which are members of the
Federal Reserve payments system - conduct joint examinations of a
cross-section of big banks in partnership with his proposed new Federal
Banking Commission.
This commission would have three members appointed for staggered six-year
terms, as well as the Treasury secretary and a Fed governor.
He resisted, however, the Fed's desire to remain a separate regulatory
agency.
'The federal government is not Noah's ark. We don't have, or need, two
Securities and Exchange Commissions. Or two Food and Drug Administrations.
Or two central banks. We don't need two sets of rules and interpreters, or
two sets of examinations,' he told the Senate banking committee.
Mr Bentsen offered to allow the Fed to conduct joint examinations with the
Federal Banking Commission of 10 of the 20 largest US banks, as well as of a
cross-section of smaller banks. 'But there will be just one exam per
institution. Just one,' Mr Bentsen said.
This concession on joint examinations falls short, however, of meeting the
Fed's demands, which are expected to be laid out at another hearing of the
Senate banking committee today.
The Fed's principal argument so far has been that it needs to be closely
involved in bank regulation in order to stay in touch with market conditions
that could affect the whole US financial system. Critics point out that the
German Bundesbank, generally held out as a model central bank, has no such
responsibilities.

<TEXT>
The Venezuelan government has extended the freeze on the retail price of
medicines in place since the start of January for 90 days, and set maximum
limits on price rises for some food items.
The minister of economic development, Mr Luis Carlos Palacios, said that
from yesterday prices for a list of mass-consumption food items frozen since
January could be raised by a maximum of 2.5 per cent a month, just below the
government's 1994 inflation target of 35 per cent. These items include
bread, sugar, vegetable oil, rice, powdered milk, flour, spaghetti and
tinned sardines.
There are no controls on the prices of most other goods and services,
although items such as electric power rates, public transport fares and
domestic fuel prices are still regulated or set by the government.
The government announcement came as a price control decree issued by the
last administration was due to expire. Mr Palacios said business had agreed
to exercise voluntary restraint on price increases as part of efforts to
tame inflation, which reached 46 per cent last year.
If prices rose too quickly, he said the government could use the special
economic powers it assumed last weekend to order strict price controls.
In a second stage of the administration's inflation control plan, officials
will try to convince businesses from producer to retail level to restrain
price increases voluntarily for other goods and services not included in the
mass consumption list.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Brazilian unions threaten strikes
</HEADLINE>

   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Union leaders in Brazil's biggest industrial state, Sao Paulo, are
threatening one-day strikes in protest against economic measures announced
on Monday by Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the finance minister.
Unions claim the measures, designed to pave the way for adoption of a new
currency, will reduce workers' spending power.
Metalworkers in Sao Paulo are due to strike today and union leaders are
expected to meet next week to consider further action.
They are worried that under Mr Cardoso's plan salaries are being
compulsorily switched into a new accounting unit, the URV (real unit of
value), while prices remain free to increase in the local currency, the
cruzeiro real.
Business leaders say the strikes are unlikely to be widespread, especially
once workers realise the new unit will lead to stable salaries.
'There is no atmosphere for a strike in the country at the moment,'
according to Mr Wilson Brumer, president of Acesita, a specialist steel
company.
Reaction to Mr Cardoso's announcement was generally positive, although
several analysts foresee considerable political pressure to increase
spending ahead of October's elections.
Inflation is not expected to fall significantly before the package's next
stage, the full adoption of a new currency, likely in May.
Mr Pierre-Alain de Smedt, president of Autolatina, the holding company for
Volkswagen and Ford's combined operations, said it remained too early to
assess the plan in detail.
'But what is very positive is that the government has been extremely
consistent and transparent in putting it forward,' he said.
Autolatina plans to start pricing its cars in URVs. The government hopes the
private sector will all switch to the new unit.
It is partly designed to replace a number of different indices already in
use which measure price rises, thus fuelling inflationary expectations.

Israel is about to introduce a new series of protectionist measures, giving

The new regulations, drawn up by a team headed by Mr Ilan Plato, Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin's economic adviser, require that local suppliers be
awarded contracts even if their bids are up to 15 per cent higher than those
of foreign competitors. Mr Rabin said: 'It's about time the world got the

The US Export-Import Bank has announced an offer of a Dollars 34.3m
subsidised loan to a US company seeking a contract from Indonesia's
state-owned dredging company, PT Rukindo, Nancy Dunne reports from
Washington.
If the US wins the contract, it will be the first subsidised loan begun
under the Clinton administration, which is formulating a more aggressive
export finance strategy. The financing backs a bid by Ellicott Machine of
Baltimore to sell dredging equipment.
Mr Kenneth Brody, Eximbank chairman, yesterday said the bank was pushing
support for small companies such as Ellicott. It will match, in this case,
the offer by a competing Norwegian company, whose name Eximbank could not
disclose, of long-term loans at low interest rates.

<TEXT>
Rolls-Royce yesterday was selected to supply its heavy thrust Trent 800
engines to power three Boeing 777 wide-body twin engine airliners for
Transbrasil, Paul Betts, Aerospace Correspondent, writes from London.
The UK company was competing for the Brazilian order against its two larger
US rivals, General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney.
The new Rolls-Royce-powered 777s, which are still subject to Brazilian
government approval, are due to enter airline service in 1996-97 on routes
between Brazil and the US.
Transbrasil's 777 order, worth about Dollars 400m (Pounds 274m) for the
aircraft and engines, is the first from a Latin American carrier. It is also
the first Latin American order for the Trent 800 engine.
Sir Ralph Robins, Rolls-Royce chairman, said the deal would renew the UK
aero-enginemaker's links with Transbrasil after about 20 years. The
Brazilian carrier flew an all Rolls-Royce engined fleet in the early 1970s,
operating Dart-powered Handley Page Heralds and Spey-powered BAC
One-Elevens.

<TEXT>
Wellcome's patents on its second best-selling drug, the Aids treatment AZT,
are likely to face a direct challenge in Europe next month when a Portuguese
company launches a Canadian-made version.
Farma APS Productos Farmaceuticos has been authorised by the Portuguese
government to market Apo-Zido- vudine, a form of AZT made by Apotex,
Canada's biggest generic drug maker.
It would be priced 15 to 20 per cent lower than Wellcome's product and would
be on the market by April, said Mr Augusto Paiva dos Santos, Farma APS
director-general. The move could set a precedent as Wellcome fights to
defend patents on Retrovir, its version of AZT, in several countries.
The UK company has been in a series of patent disputes with companies,
including Apotex, over the right to sell AZT. So far Wellcome has won in the
US, and has actions outstanding in Canada and France.
Apotex said yesterday that 'we're moving aggressively all over the world'.
Portugal is the first European country to register Apo-Zidovudine, but the
product is already on sale in some Canadian provinces, Senegal, South
Africa, Brazil and other countries.
Retrovir sales were worth Pounds 248m in 1993, and Mr Paiva dos Santos said
they exceeded Es500m (Pounds 1.9m) in Portugal. His company plans to compete
with Retrovir to supply AZT to Portuguese hospitals.
Wellcome's main patents on Retrovir run out in 2005 but the company may be
vulnerable in Portugal because of its patent laws. Wellcome has a local
patent on the manufacturing process, but had not been able to patent the
material itself. This implies that to prove its patent had been infringed it
would have to show that Apotex's product was made by a patented process,
which could be more complicated than simply showing that the end product was
chemically identical.
Farma APS said it might export the drug to other European Union countries
and did not foresee any legal difficulties.
Wellcome said: 'We will challenge breaches of our patent and hope that
Portugal, as a member of the European Union, will respect intellectual
property rights.' In a weak stock market yesterday, Wellcome shares rose 2p
to 656p.

FT  02 MAR 94 / World Trade News: EU and Tokyo close on vehicle import
numbers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission and the Japanese government are close to agreeing a
forecast for new vehicle sales in the European Union, which would leave the
level of Japanese vehicle exports to the EU virtually unchanged from last
year.
The Commission is optimistic that last year's prolonged conflict over the
level of Japanese vehicle exports to the EU can be avoided.
The latest round of talks, which ended in Tokyo at the weekend, had shown
for the first time that little divided the forecasts of the two sides, Mr
Martin Bangemann, European industry commissioner, said yesterday.
The EU expected new vehicle demand in west Europe to remain virtually
unchanged at last year's very depressed level, said Mr Bangemann, while the
Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry, was forecasting
modest growth of up to 3 per cent.
The EU market for cars and light commercial vehicles fell by 15.9 per cent
to 11.739m last year, the steepest decline of the post-war period.
In its original estimates last year Tokyo had refused to accept gloomy
European forecasts of a steep fall in sales and was then forced to curtail
exports drastically last autumn to bring shipments in line with the 1991
EU/Japan accord on Japanese vehicle sales in the Union.
Direct Japanese vehicle exports to the EU fell last year by 18.4 per cent to
980,000 units. The Commission expects a second round of talks with Tokyo to
be held in mid-March.
Addressing a European car industry forum organised by the Commission and the
European Parliament, Mr Bangemann gave his clear backing yesterday for a
continuation of the current controversial 'block exemption' for the motor
industry, which allows carmakers to use a selective distribution system with
exclusive dealers in breach of European competition law.
The 10-year block exemption is due to expire in mid-1995, and the Commission
is still divided over whether to accept the motor industry's demand for the
selective distribution system to continue.
Mr Bangemann said that the system played an important role in the monitoring
of Japanese vehicle sales in the EU. 'On no account should this be
endangered,' he said.
He also dismissed arguments from European consumer organisations that the
system was responsible for high car prices in the EU.
'I do not believe that getting rid of the selective and exclusive
distribution system would lead to more choice and lower prices - but just
the reverse,' he said.

FT  02 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Kazakh office for Wimpey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wimpey says it has become the first UK construction group to establish a
permanent office in Kazakhstan, the oil-rich former Soviet republic.
Because of its large mineral wealth, Kazakhstan offers some of the most
attractive development and business opportunities in the former Soviet bloc.
The country is second only to Russia among the 15 ex-USSR republics in
attracting foreign investment.
Wimpey has identified up to Dollars 1bn (Pounds 685m) of construction and
engineering work which it says the country is likely to let this year to
international contractors, with next year's figure likely to be twice as
big.
By 1996, as it modernises and improves its infrastructure, the country could
be offering work worth up to Dollars 4bn a year to international
construction companies.
Investment by multinationals in Kazakhstan should provide a further impetus
for construction work, says Wimpey. Mercedes-Benz, Fiat, and Daewoo have all
established sales offices in the country. Philip Morris is investing Dollars
300m for an 88 per cent share in a cigarette factory and some tobacco farms,
and Grand Metropolitan, the UK drinks group, last month announced a joint
venture to market Smirnoff vodka in the country.
Wimpey has established an office in the capital, Alma-Ata. The country has
substantial deposits of gas, gold, silver, lead, zinc and copper. After
Russia it is the second biggest former Soviet oil producer, with an annual
output of about 22m tonnes and reserves estimated to be as high as 35bn
barrels.
Other potential contracts include substantial road refurbishment, upgrading
the capital's subway system and mass transit systems generally. Wimpey is
already thought to be close to winning contracts to build several hotels.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
French aerospace leaders yesterday accused President Bill Clinton of
intervening unfairly to sell Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4.1bn) worth of US civil
aircraft to Saudia Arabia, while announcing sharp falls in their own
turnover and exports last year.
Mr Louis Gallois, president of Aerospatiale, the French partner in Europe's
Airbus consortium, said the US government appeared to have entered into
'real state-to-state negotiations' to secure the deal with Saudia, the Saudi
Arabian carrier. This was unprecedented in civil, as distinct from military,
contracts, he said, adding: 'If this becomes a permanent American attitude,
we must prepare ourselves in Europe for this type of trade.'
In an interview Mr Gerard Longuet, France's trade and industry minister,
said the US civil aircraft sale appeared to be 'linked to rescheduling of
Saudi Arabia's military debt', referring to reports that Riyadh is to delay
payment of Dollars 6bn of the Dollars 9bn it owes US military jet makers
over the next two years. Mr Serge Dassault, president of Dassault Aviation
and of GIFAS, the French aerospace industry association, said it was
symptomatic of Washington's involvement that, contrary to traditional
practice, the Saudia deal was announced by Mr Clinton himself, 'the supplier
rather than the client'.
Announcing that their collective turnover had fallen by 8.5 per cent and
exports by 12.9 per cent last year, leaders of the French aerospace industry
 -Europe's largest - urged Europe to stand up to the US in the Gatt
negotiations to control aircraft subsidies.
But, Mr Gallois said, while 'Europe should continue to defend its system of
direct subsidies or reimbursable advances (which Airbus receives), it is
also worth reflecting whether and how we could adopt the US system of
indirect aid, so that perhaps we could have two irons in the fire'.
An executive of Snecma, the French aero-engine maker, warned, however, that
failure to reach any agreement with the US would leave the aircraft industry
without any special treatment on subsidies. French aero-engine exports alone
fell 26.6 per cent last year.
The level of new orders - which determine future turnover and exports - fell
last year by 20 per cent to FFr88bn (Pounds 10.1bn) from FFr110bn in 1992.
The contract to sell 60 Mirage 2000-5 jets and a large number of missiles to
Taiwan was included in the 1992 order book, though deliveries will only
begin in a couple of years.
Waiting for such arms export orders to work through, the French aerospace
industry is also hoping that the government will unveil an ambitious
1995-2000 military procurement programme this year and that the civil
aircraft sector will soon revive. But the interim is proving lean. Dassault,
the maker of Mirage jets, saw its turnover drop 20 per cent last year,
though it claims to have improved profitability.

FT  02 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Brussels challenges Hollywood moguls -
Protection of EU film industry urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the European cultural commissioner, yesterday
called for greater protection of the European film industry to counter the
power of big Hollywood studios.
Mr Pinheiro said the European Commission was considering possible changes
later this year to the 'television without frontiers' directive which sets
quotas on foreign broadcasting material and films. He also called for
'positive measures' to promote European programming and films.
The Portuguese commissioner suggested that these measures would create a
breathing space for European industry as it struggles against US
competition, and could be dropped 'once Europe has a healthy film and TV
production sector again'.
His comments are certain to fuel controversy about the future of European
broadcasting policy and increase tensions with the US. Only last week, Mr
Pinheiro caused a stir by calling for an end to the system which has allowed
the Hollywood studios to pool their resources to distribute films in Europe
without falling foul of EU competition rules.
The Commission will shortly produce a green paper on a strategy for the
audio-visual industry based on two central figures: that 50 per cent of
programmes on European channels are of US origin, and that US films now
account for at least 80 per cent of box-office revenue in every EU country,
except France, where it is around 60 per cent.
In his speech to US film producers yesterday, Mr Pinheiro said it was time
to redress the 'serious imbalance' which existed in the European film
market.
'Given that admissions in movie theatres in Europe on the average stagnate,
would it not be in the interests of us all. . . to develop policies
developing this market? I believe the answer is Yes.'
Hollywood, which has strong support within the Clinton administration, is
likely to be wary of calls for market-sharing dressed up as co-operation.
Speaking in Vienna last Monday, Mr Stuart Eizenstat, US ambassador to the
EU, said that European quotas on US films were 'repugnant' and infringed the
principle of freedom of speech.
Mr Pinheiro is vying with French politicians for the title of champion of
European culture. In his speech, he attributed the US movie industry's
success to the existence of a sound domestic market.
'American films deal with standard stories for a linguistic and culturally
unified public,' he claimed.
The commissioner, a former Portuguese foreign minister, suggested it was
time to create a similar broad European market. 'The mistake to avoid could
be the creation of 'culturally confused' productions.'
Last year, Mr John Birt, director general of the BBC, warned the European
Union against attempting to create a 'synthetic Euro-culture with a
harmonised media industry'.

FT  02 MAR 94 / World Trade News: New light on sinkings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
New light is shed on the reasons for a series of sinkings among dry bulk
carriers during the late-1980s and early-1990s, in a report* published
recently, Charles Batchelor, Transport Correspondent, writes from London.
A total of 64 dry bulk carriers and ore/bulk/oil carriers (OBOs) were lost
in the three years from 1991-1993, prompting concerns about the way dry bulk
vessels, which typically carry iron ore or coal, were built and the advanced
age of the fleet.
But many of the losses were of OBOs, which can carry either dry bulk or oil
as cargo, while navigational error was a more important reason for loss than
structural or engineering problems, according to a new study by Intercargo,
the International Association of Dry Cargo Shipowners.
OBOs are often much larger than dry bulk carriers and are subdivided into
separate tanks for oil, which makes them more difficult to sink. But they
are more vulnerable to explosions, difficult to maintain and more prone to
corrosion. In 1992 the loss of nine OBOs disguised a sharp fall in dry bulk
losses to 20 from 28 the previous year.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Settlements forced to top of peace agenda: The issue Rabin
was desperate to keep for later in Mideast talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOROVITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, has tied the future of his
government and his country to the peace process. If that process collapses,
it is likely his government's chances of winning re-election will collapse
with it. And, more important perhaps, chances of a stable Middle East
emerging in the foreseeable future are likely to disappear too.
Yet this week, after the massacre in Hebron's Cave of the Patriarchs and
with the Palestine Liberation Organisation demanding a crackdown on
extremist settlers as a condition for resuming negotiations on Palestinian
self-rule in the occupied territories, the prime minister has held back.
Mr Rabin and some of his more loyal ministers have been portraying a new
series of measures introduced to curb the wildest settler excesses as harsh
beyond precedent. But placing half-a-dozen of the most unsavoury ideologues
into three-month terms of administrative detention, and disarming or
restricting the movements of about a hundred more, has been insufficient to
reassure the Palestinians or to woo them back to the negotiating table.
Baruch Goldstein, the Brooklyn-born doctor whose 111 bullets last Friday
have done such damage to the fragile Israeli-Palestinian reconciliation,
would not have been on the army's top-six list of dangerous settlers,
possibly not even in the top 50. The expressions of support for his actions
from sections of the settlement movement suggest that there may be more
Baruch Goldsteins out there waiting.
While few in the Israeli mainstream advocate disarming all 115,000 settlers,
as the PLO has demanded, there are many, including several cabinet
ministers, who believe the time has come to evacuate the most provocative
settlements, such as the Beit Hadassah enclave in the heart of the
Palestinian population in Hebron.
Then, there is the question of the expense and army manpower needed to
protect small settlements against Palestinian extremists. Mr Shimon Peres,
the foreign minister, has wondered aloud why the army should have to provide
security for the isolated settlement of Netzarim in the Gaza Strip, home to
just 28 Jewish families. But Mr Rabin is adamant that no settlements will be
dismantled at present and no settlers offered compensation as an incentive
to leave.
It is not that Mr Rabin is fundamentally opposed to the concept of uprooting
settlements, as will be sought eventually by the PLO. Far from it. While he
is publicly reticent on the subject, his aides have always indicated that
the prime minister regards barely a third of the 140-plus settlements dotted
throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip as serving a vital security purpose.
His ultimate vision, those aides believe, would be to retain the new Jewish
Jerusalem suburbs that have sprung up since the capture of Arab East
Jerusalem in 1967, plus a ring of settlements protecting Jerusalem, and
another row along the eastern edge of the West Bank, on the border with
Jordan. The residents of most other settlements should be offered
compensation to move back into Israel, or face the prospect of living under
Palestinian rule.
The problem with that vision is that it is not shared by a substantial
proportion of the Israeli electorate. Many, maybe even most, Israelis are
still reluctant to see settlements evacuated in a land-for-peace deal with
the Palestinians. Even in the immediate aftermath of Friday's massacre, a
newspaper poll showed that while 46 per cent of Israelis wanted the Beit
Hadassah enclave evacuated, 50 per cent believed the settlers should be
allowed to remain.
Mr Rabin's intention, as reflected in the provisions of the framework
autonomy accords signed at the White House last September, was to win over
public support gradually. This would be achieved by first granting the
Palestinians self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. It would then be extended
throughout much of the West Bank. Over the next two years this should allow
the level of Israeli-Palestinian violence to ebb and the first seeds of
mutual respect to sprout.
Only in 1996, according to the framework accords, were settlements intended
to feature on the negotiating agenda. And by the time it came to encouraging
settlers to leave, at the end of the interim period in 1998/1999, Mr Rabin
was betting that a substantial majority of Israelis would be prepared to
sacrifice settlements in the cause of a peaceful co-existence they were
already enjoying.
Certainly, Mr Rabin was aware, there would always be settler extremists
determined to ensure Israel retained control of the West Bank and Gaza. But
they would be an isolated minority; an awkward irritation, not an immovable
obstacle.
Baruch Goldstein has badly dented that scenario. Palestinian negotiators are
asking if there is much point in discussing the minute details of the
planned transfer of authority, when Goldstein's admirers are free to roam
through Arab population centres, machine-guns at the ready, able to open
fire at whim and make a mockery of efforts to bring a new era of calm to the
occupied territories.
Some Palestinian leaders have been saying since Friday that, unless the
settlement issue is placed on the negotiating agenda now, there can be no
resumption of talks. Others have stopped short of such a precondition. And
Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, has been characteristically vague.
Doubtless, in their frequent communications over the past few days, Mr Rabin
has been explaining to Mr Arafat exactly why he feels he cannot confront the
settlement issue just yet. The future of the Gaza-and-Jericho-first autonomy
plan, so close to realisation before last Friday, may well now hinge on
whether Mr Arafat accepts that explanation.

FT  02 MAR 94 / PLO demands pullout timetable be kept: Prisoners released as
Israel seeks to lure Palestinians back to peace talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON, JULIAN OZANNE and AP
</BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Middle East peace process could collapse if Israel does not begin its
withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho by April 13, the original date for
completing the pullout, one of the chief Palestinian architects of the
PLO-Israeli declaration of principles said yesterday.
But Mr Ahmad Quorieh, a senior member of the PLO executive committee, said
in an interview he believed the PLO could not resume negotiations on
implementing the declaration unless Israel agreed to discuss the future of
Jewish settlements in the occupied territories and made further guarantees
for the protection of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.
Mr Quorieh's assessment came as Israel began freeing 500 Palestinian
prisoners yesterday in a further attempt to win back the PLO to peace talks
after last Friday's Hebron mosque massacre. The government also offered
compensation to Palestinian victims and said up to 100 Jewish settlers would
be disarmed.
PLO leaders in the occupied territories said the gestures were insufficient.
They added that Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, would have to stay away from
direct peace talks with Israel for at least two to four weeks to assuage
Palestinian outrage at the Hebron killings.
The PLO demands for peace talks to resume include the disarmament of all
120,000 settlers and the dismantling of some of the more extremist
ideological settlements such as Kiryat Arba, the 6,000-strong Jewish
community just outside Hebron where Dr Baruch Goldstein, who carried out
last Friday's massacre, lived.
Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said Israel could meet demands
such as disarming extremist settlers and preventing their movement into some
sensitive areas, allowing an unarmed international force to be deployed in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip for a short period, and increasing the
Palestinian police force for Gaza-Jericho from 8,000 to 10,000. However he
added that the government rejected PLO demands for disarming all settlers
and dismantling some settlements.
One or more PLO leaders are expected to fly to Washington today to discuss
with the US administration the PLO's demands before peace talks can resume.
In the US capital, Secretary of State Warren Christopher told a House
appropriations subcommittee yesterday that Mr Arafat had assured him by
telephone that he would send envoys to the Washington talks, but that he
'needed a little time'. A senior US official said a PLO emissary would
arrive in Washington today and would meet the secretary of state tomorrow.
Mr Christopher added that Mr Arafat was indispensable to peace efforts in
the Middle East.
The PLO is, meanwhile, hoping the UN Security Council will pass a resolution
calling on Israel to accept an 'international presence' in the territories
and to implement measures 'including the confiscation of arms' to prevent
further settler violence.
The US, Palestinians and Egypt were yesterday finalising the text of such a
resolution, which would do no more than request Israel to accede to the UN
call.
In Tunis Mr Quorieh, who was central to the secret talks in Norway which led
to the PLO-Israeli accord, said frustration over delays in implementing the
declaration of principles and the Hebron massacre had combined to create
'the seeds of real conflict' in the occupied territories. 'If April 13 comes
without an Israeli withdrawal, I have my doubts that this agreement will
fly,' he said.
He added that the PLO 'cannot deliver peace' under the present circumstances
of tension in the occupied territories without much stronger Israeli action
, and that the declaration of principles could survive only 'if the Israelis
begin to take real measures that people can see'.
As the release of Palestinian prisoners got under way yesterday, clashes
erupted for a fourth day throughout the occupied territories. In Hebron and
surrounding areas, a 24-hour curfew on Palestinians was relaxed, but black
flags of mourning remained on many homes. Relatives of the victims of last
Friday's massacre vowed to take revenge on Jewish settlers.
And in a possible sign of reprisals spreading to the west, a man described
as an Arab shot four ultra-orthodox Jewish youths in New York as their van
approached Brooklyn Bridge. Although he was heard to shout 'Kill the Jews,'
police said a traffic dispute may have sparked the incident. No fatalities
were immediately confirmed.
In Washington, US Attorney General Janet Reno and Mr Louis Freeh, FBI
director, said they were monitoring the situation.
AP adds: Soldiers accidentally shot an Israeli settler couple in the
occupied West Bank yesterday. The man later died of his wounds, a spokesman
for the settlers said.
Israel radio and army radio initially said the shooting near the West Bank
settlement of Ariel was an ambush. The army confirmed that two Israelis were
wounded and that it was investigating the circumstances.
It was the second shooting accident in the area since Sunday when soldiers
mistakenly opened fire on an Israeli vehicle near the Arab town of Anabta,
wounding two Israelis.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Hopes rise over HK airport talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Britain and China will hold their first formal talks tomorrow on financing
Hong Kong's multi-billion-dollar airport since last August, raising hopes
that Beijing may be moving closer to an agreement.
The meeting, at China's request, will discuss the Hong Kong government's
fourth financial plan for the airport and its connecting railway.
It follows the collapse of Anglo-Chinese co-operation on Hong Kong's
political development last week and has prompted speculation among British
diplomats that China may be moving towards a separation of economic from
political issues.
China has consistently criticised the Hong Kong government's financial plans
for the project. It has said the government wants to raise too much debt to
finance the project: debt which the post-1997 government will have to
shoulder.
The government's first financial plan, which found favour with international
bankers, provided for HKDollars 16.3bn (Pounds 1.4bn) of equity and
HKDollars 66.6bn of debt.
Earlier this year, the government offered, in its fourth revised plan, to
increase its equity contribution to airport and railway to HKDollars 60bn,
from HKDollars 45bn previously, and to cut the amount of debt needed to
finance the project to HKDollars 23bn from HKDollars 38bn.
It is unclear how China will react to this latest plan, in spite of its
much-reduced borrowing requirement. Last weekend, after a meeting in Beijing
of the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC), some PWC members complained the
government had not gone far enough.
It would be surprising if China were to agree to the Hong Kong government's
latest plan without extracting further concessions. As today's budget will
show, the government's revenues are buoyant and it could afford to pump more
equity into the project.
Hong Kong's property developers shrugged off interest-rate and political
worries yesterday to bid record prices for three plots of residential land
at a government auction, Reuter reports from Hong Kong.
'The prices were way above expectations. This is obviously a huge vote of
confidence in the colony,' government land auctioneer Nigel Burley said
after the auction.
Hong Kong's stock market reacted negatively to the auction.

Japan's ailing jobs market perked up slightly in January, to the markets'
surprise, but the underlying unemployment rate continues to rise, William
Dawkins in Tokyo reports.
Unemployment inched down to 2.7 per cent in January, from a revised 2.8 per
cent in the previous month, the first fall for nearly two years. The number
of jobs available rose slightly to 67 for every 100 people looking for work,
from 65 in the previous month.
However, the January jobless rate still stands at a six-year high and the
number of companies announcing early retirements and freezes on recruitment
continues to rise.
The total out of work rose by 21 per cent from the same month last year, to
1.84m, the government's management and co-ordination agency reported.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Australian budget priorities outlined
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Australia's budget priorities in May would be 'to improve the prospects for
the long-term unemployed, to promote industry and regional development and
to implement the Native Title legislation', Mr Ralph Willis, Australian
treasurer, said yesterday.
These measures, coupled with the government's commitment to cut the budget
deficit to about 1 per cent of gross domestic product by 1996-97, meant
'little scope for further substantial initiatives this year'.
His comments came as he unveiled the government's initial budget platform,
contained in a 'fiscal framework' document. Publication is the starting
point for talks on budget details with the Labor party caucus and parties
holding the balance of power in the Senate. The government wants to avoid a
repeat of last year's fiasco when its finance package became stalled in
parliament. A defined period for negotiations has been set this year, and
the budget date moved forward to May.
The fiscal framework provided few new projections about the economy. But it
did play down the likelihood of a 'jobs levy' to fund the unemployment
measures. 'A jobs levy. . . has been suggested as a means of accommodating
increased expenditure pressure without prejudicing the deficit reduction
programme,' it said.
'The government ..would prefer to meet its aims without having to introduce
such a measure.'

Angola devalued its official exchange rate by nearly 30 per cent yesterday,
the third devaluation in the past two weeks. Reuter reports from Luanda.
The National Bank of Angola said the official rate of the kwanza was now
24,970 to the dollar, compared to 17,838 in force since February 21 and
12,740 from February 14 when it was cut from 6,500.
The devaluation was part of adjusting the official exchange rate to 'a point
of macro-economic equilibrium', the bank added.
Unita rebels accused Angolan government negotiators of not taking seriously
their demands for political power in long-running peace talks to end nearly
two decades of civil war.
Unita spokesmen said government negotiators had offered it only one
governorship out of the 18 provinces, and insignificant ministerial posts.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Vietnam's jobless problem comes out into the open: Roads
into Hanoi are now informal job centres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAIN SIMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the sun rises over Hanoi, hundreds of young men gather on the dusty verge
in the middle of Giang Vo street. Some sit in groups; others lie on blankets
trying to sleep. Most of the men are peasant farmers. All are looking for
work.
Giang Vo street is one of six or more main roads leading into the Vietnamese
capital which have become informal job centres. Foremen looking for labour
on one of the dozens of construction sites around Hanoi come to hire workers
by the day, the week or the hour.
Giang Vo is lined with shops selling building materials, and the men waiting
for work hope some of the customers will need labour as well as bricks and
cement. If they are lucky, they will earn up to Dollars 3 (Pounds 2) a day
and return at night to the cheap, crowded hostels where they stay while they
are working in Hanoi.
Some men come every day from the countryside around Hanoi to look for work;
others have trekked several hundred miles from the provinces of central
Vietnam, where, when the rice is planted, there is little else to do.
Unemployment is one of the biggest problems now facing the government in
Vietnam. Since pro-market economic reforms were introduced in 1986, the
level of joblessness has increased rapidly.
Official figures show more than 2m people unemployed out of a workforce of
32m. There are also 5m-6m people who are under-employed.
Tens of thousands of workers have also been laid off by bankrupt state
factories and are looking for new jobs. Also unemployed are many former
soldiers demobilised after the Vietnamese army pulled its troops out of
Cambodia in 1989.
Most of the under-employed are peasant farmers, who work in the fields for
four to six months of the year. For the rest of the time there is no work in
their home villages, so they go to towns and cities in search of other work.
Until recently, the problem of rural under-employment was disguised because
people from the countryside were not allowed to travel to cities such as
Hanoi; any found looking for a job were rounded up and sent home. Since
1992, as internal travel restrictions have eased, the under-employed have
appeared on the streets of the capital.
One group of men waiting for work on Giang Vo street had arrived in Hanoi a
week earlier from the central province of Quang Tri, one of the poorest in
Vietnam. 'Living in the countryside, I have no job. I came here so that I
can feed my family,' one of the men said. But he would not move his family
to Hanoi because he could not make enough money for them all to live.
The government hopes that growing foreign investment and the domestic
economic boom will create work for many of the people now jobless. But
western economists in Hanoi believe unemployment will continue to be a
serious problem in Vietnam for many years to come.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Israel begins freeing prisoners

   KIRYAT ARBA, OCCUPIED WEST BANK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel began freeing 500 Palestinian prisoners yesterday, offered
compensation to Palestinian victims, and said up to 100 Jewish settlers
would be disarmed, as the government stepped up gestures to win back the PLO
to peace talks after last Friday's Hebron mosque massacre.
PLO leaders in the occupied territories said the gestures were insufficient,
but Israeli ministers said the Jewish state would not meet all PLO demands.
These include the disarmament of all 120,000 settlers and the dismantling of
some of the more extremist settlements such as Kiryat Arba, the 6,000-strong
Jewish community just outside Hebron where Dr Baruch Goldstein, who carried
out last Friday's massacre, lived.
Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said Israel would prevent the
movement of extremist settlers into some sensitive areas, allow an unarmed
international force to be deployed in the West Bank and Gaza Strip for a
short period, and increase the Palestinian police force for Gaza-Jericho
from 8,000 to 10,000. But it rejected PLO demands for even tougher measures
against the settlers and settlements.
Palestinian leaders said Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, would have to stay
away from direct peace talks with Israel for at least two to four weeks, to
assuage outrage at the Hebron massacre.
As the prisoner release got under way, clashes erupted for a fourth day
throughout the occupied territories; Gen Ehud Barak, Chief of Staff, said
the army was expecting a wave of revenge attacks from Palestinians which it
could not prevent completely.
In Hebron and surrounding areas, a 24-hour curfew on Palestinians was
relaxed, but black flags of mourning remained on many homes. Relatives of
the victims of last Friday's bloodbath vowed to take revenge on Jewish
settlers.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Hopes rise as UK and China resume HK airport talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Britain and China will hold their first formal talks tomorrow on financing
Hong Kong's multi-billion-dollar airport since last August, raising hopes
that Beijing may be moving closer to an agreement.
The meeting, at China's request, will discuss the Hong Kong government's
fourth financial plan for the airport and its connecting railway.
It follows the collapse of Anglo-Chinese co-operation on Hong Kong's
political development last week and has prompted speculation among British
diplomats that China might be moving towards a separation of economic from
political issues.
China has consistently criticised the Hong Kong government's financial plans
for the project. It has said the government wants to raise too much debt to
finance the project: debt which the post-1997 government will have to
shoulder.
The government's first financial plan, which found favour with international
bankers, provided for HKDollars 16.3bn (Pounds 1.4bn) of equity and
HKDollars 66.6bn of debt.
Earlier this year, the government offered, in its fourth revised plan, to
increase its equity contribution to airport and railway to HKDollars 60bn,
from HKDollars 45bn previously, and to cut the amount of debt needed to
finance the project to HKDollars 23bn from HKDollars 38bn.
It is unclear how China will react to this latest plan, in spite of its
much-reduced borrowing requirement. Last weekend, after a meeting in Beijing
of the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC), some PWC members complained the
government had not gone far enough.
It would be surprising if China were to agree to the Hong Kong government's
latest plan without extracting further concessions. As today's budget will
show, the government's revenues are buoyant and it could afford to pump more
equity into the project.
Hong Kong's property developers shrugged off interest-rate and political
worries yesterday to bid record prices for three plots of residential land
at a government auction, Reuter reports from Hong Kong.
'The prices were way above expectations. This is obviously a huge vote of
confidence in the colony,' government land auctioneer Nigel Burley said
after the auction.
Mr Burley said the developed properties, units of which will be sold to the
public before completion, will come on to the market around 1996 to 1997.
Hong Kong reverts to China in July, 1997.
Analysts said they were surprised at the high prices - the two more
expensive plots at over HKDollars 2bn (Pounds 173.5m) each surpassed
expectations by more than HKDollars 500m apiece.
But Hong Kong's stock market reacted negatively to the auction.

FT  02 MAR 94 / German inflation eases: Economic watch
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
West Germany's inflation rate fell to 3.3 per cent in February from 3.5 per
cent the month before, helped by falling goods prices and lower real wages,
though hopes of a fall below 3 per cent this year still depend on
developments in rents, import prices and public and private sector services.
Nonetheless, the Bundesbank repo rate fell to 5.97 per cent this week, from
the 6 per cent rate seen since early December. Prices for goods rose only
2.3 per cent in 1993. Gross pay for west German industrial workers fell by a
real 1.6 per cent - the first fall since 1983 - while white-collar pay
stagnated. The government warned, however, that west German basic hourly pay
was still growing too quickly. Between 1985 and 1992, wages rose a real 20.6
per cent, compared with 12 per cent in Japan, 5-6 per cent in France, Italy
and the Netherlands and an 8 per cent fall in the US.
Spain's industrial production rose 6.2 per cent in December from a year
earlier, but declined 7.6 per cent from November 1993, leaving industrial
production for the year down 4.6 per cent on the 1992 figure.
Swedish new car registrations rose by 12 per cent last month to a
preliminary 10,714 units, from 9,549 in February 1993. New registrations in
January and February were up 20 per cent, to 21,111 from 17,568 the same two
months in 1993.

Opinion polls suggest the two parties in the governing coalition - the

Lubbers, and the Labour party - would lose their majority if general
elections were held this week, with the opposition Liberals and D66
registering sharp gains. A poll by the Nipo polling company suggests the
Christian Democrat's support would fall to just 35 seats in parliament, from
54 in the 1989 elections, and Labour to 31 seats, down from 49.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Turkey's currency crisis deepened yesterday, with the lira losing a further
7.8 per cent, following the official 12 per cent devaluation in January,
writes John Murray Brown from Ankara. The central bank dollar rate of
TL21,550, compared with a devaluation rate of TL17,250, is putting the
economy under increased strain. A sharp increase in overnight interest
rates, up to 200 per cent on Monday, has not slowed the depreciation and
with reserves down 25 per cent since the start of the year, there is little
room available for bank intervention. On February 18 reserves stood at
Dollars 4.6bn (Pounds 3.15bn) compared with Dollars 7.7bn on December 30.
The crisis was sparked by the growing public deficit and the announcement
that Turkey's international credit rating had been downgraded by two
agencies.

German public sector workers yesterday stepped up a nationwide campaign of

In both sectors workers have been angered by management calls for a wage
freeze and benefit cuts against a backdrop of recession. The public employee
protests have hit transport systems, hospitals, kindergartens and waste
collection in large cities across Germany. Meanwhile, Mr Jurgen Peters, head
of the IG Metall union in the north German state of Lower Saxony, said he
was confident 100,000 engineering workers voting this week would decide
overwhelmingly in favour of a strike. The first vote showed an 80 per cent
turnout rate, IG Metall said, with a 75 per cent majority of votes needed
for a strike. Government officials have talks set with the OTV public sector
union for next week, but no talks are in prospect between the two sides in
the engineering dispute.

information to intelligence agents at the British embassy in Moscow.
A Russian official later identified the man as the manager of a state-owned
company called Special Machine Building and Metallurgy, which specialises in
military armour and artillery. Itar-Tass said he was arrested on January 15
and charged on January 25 with 'high treason in the form of espionage'.
Only two days after promising western financial institutions that it
remained wedded to financial austerity, the Russian government was yesterday

a panacea for problems which its radical predecessors had vowed to tackle by
freeing coal prices and restructuring the industry. Mr Victor Chernomyrdin,

FT  02 MAR 94 / Longuet sees alliances as industry's hope: John Ridding and
David Buchan talk to a French minister with a difficult brief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As minister for industry, trade, posts and telecommunications, Mr Gerard
Longuet has one of the broadest and trickiest briefs in the French
government. His in-tray bristles with delicate dossiers, from the
restructuring of public sector companies selected for privatisation to the
reform of France Telecom and the promotion of trade and investment links in
international markets.
Yesterday, for example, Mr Longuet was faced with the task of persuading Mr
Karel Van Miert, the European competition commissioner, to allow a capital
injection of FFr7bn (Pounds 812m) for Groupe Bull, the loss-making
state-owned computer group. Brussels' decision on the capital increase will
help determine the fate of one of the country's biggest technology-based
companies.
Bull is just one of the problems inherited by Mr Longuet when he took his
post in March last year. With a budget deficit target of FFr300bn this year,
the state cannot afford to fund loss-making groups and has embarked on a
programme of privatisation to support the public coffers.
However, to achieve this several companies from Bull to Pechiney, the
aluminium group, and Usinor Sacilor, the loss-making steel group, need to be
prepared for sale.
For Mr Longuet, a self-declared liberal, but also a pragmatist, the solution
is often to be found in industrial alliances.
'An important factor for Bull's privatisation is an increased relationship
with its present partners, such as NEC,' says Mr Longuet, who believes the
state's holding in Bull could be reduced to less than 50 per cent by the end
of the year.
He dismisses the political sensitivities which could arise from the sale of
a substantial part of Bull's capital to a Japanese company.
'Mr (Jean-Marie) Descarpentries (Bull's chairman) has been given carte
blanche,' he says. He expresses concern, however, about the sale of Rover to
BMW, which angered Honda, the British company's partner. 'It is a precedent
which is not favourable for relations of trust with the Japanese.'
The industry minister's enthusiasm for alliances spreads beyond the
resolution of public sector problems. In many cases, he views partnerships
as the best means to strengthen the position of French companies on the
international stage.
'Why do I want to privatise Renault?' asks Mr Longuet. 'It is to give it the
opportunity to find partnerships with other companies. If the cards in the
industry are reshuffled, there is no reason why Renault should not be
involved.'
Since the failed deal at Volvo, Renault has largely disentangled itself from
the cross-shareholdings and industrial alliances that bound the prospective
partners. Mr Longuet now hopes to privatise the French motor group this
year, depending on the state of the financial markets.
The most striking example of an alliance in Mr Longuet's domain, however, is
to be found in the courtship between France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom,
its German counterpart. The agreement last December between the second and
third largest international telecommunications operators to create a joint
venture to supply data and other services to clients is the first step
towards a deeper industrial alliance which is expected to include the
exchange of equity.
For this to happen the French telecoms group requires a change in its legal
status to transform it from a state agency to a public sector company with
its own capital. The threat of union opposition, however, has forced Mr
Longuet to delay such a change. Negotiations, he says, are being held in an
attempt to win the support of France Telecom's employees, many of whom fear
that reform is a prelude to privatisation.
Mr Longuet says privatisation is not on the cards. But he is determined to
allow the group to open its capital to forge alliances with international
partners. France Telecom's defeat by British Telecom last year in the fight
for the hand of MCI of the US is a precedent which Mr Longuet does not want
to see repeated.
The manoeuvrings of the French and German telecoms groups reflect the close
trade and industrial links between the two countries. But according to Mr
Longuet there is room for improvement in the commercial relationship.
'Germany has to accept the idea that there are other industrial countries in
Europe,' Mr Longuet says bluntly. He cites the vehicle, transport and energy
sectors as areas where co-operation should be increased with Germany to
strengthen the competitiveness of European companies against Japanese and US
rivals. One example is in high-speed railways, where the TGV produced by
GEC-Alsthom is engaged in fierce competition with the German ICE consortium.
Despite his emphasis on partnerships and alliances, Mr Longuet is confident
about the strength of French industry. 'For a European country, that is to
say a country with a certain level of social protection and salaries, France
is very competitive.' In support of this he points to export figures, which
rose in the final months of last year, despite depressed demand in markets
such as Germany.
But if France is to maintain its industrial strength, broader reforms are
needed. 'The big challenge for a liberal government in France over the
coming years is to reinforce our capital investment. We have to create the
right conditions for domestic and foreign long-term investment,' he says,
ruling out 'artificial' industrial policies that provide incentives for
specific activities.
The first step, he believes, is under way. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy
minister, has said he will introduce reform of France's pension system which
should encourage long-term savings and, through private funds, create
vehicles for long-term stock market investment.
Fears of extinguishing France's fragile consumer recovery appear to have
pushed back the reform from spring to the autumn, but Mr Longuet is certain
the reforms will take place. At least that is one problem in someone else's
in-tray.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Cash carries the day in enlargement talks: How extra EU
money broke the logjam
</HEADLINE>

The European Union showed endearing consistency yesterday in the way it
broke the logjam after five days of gruelling talks on entry terms for
Sweden, Finland, Austria and Norway.
True to past form, when faced with a choice between the four candidates'
problems about money and their difficulties over principle, the EU headed
straight for the money.
At midday yesterday, following the near collapse of the talks around dawn,
the Swedes settled for a substantial extra financial consideration which
gives them, and to a lesser extent the other applicants, a rebate on their
EU budgetary contributions in the first three years of membership.
All told, the rich newcomers will get Ecu3.6bn (Pounds 2.7bn) in 1995-98 to
cushion the instant alignment of their higher farm prices with EU levels,
which the Union insisted on. Not until the end of this period, therefore,
will they contribute the net Ecu1.7bn to the EU budget foreseen before this
last round of talks - a figure itself less than half original estimates.
The Swedes, in fact, face no wrenching adjustment of their agriculture
regime, since their farm prices are similar to the EU's. What they won was a
budget rebate disguised as a farm adjustment payment (worth up to Ecu2bn in
the first three years) and in the tradition of the contentious UK rebate won
10 years ago by Mrs Margaret Thatcher.
'Sometimes it pays to be stubborn,' remarked a Swedish negotiator with quiet
satisfaction. The Swedes had been accused of being boneheadedly stubborn
over their budget contributions, not only by the EU but by their Nordic
neighbours. But they clearly knew whom they were dealing with.
By settling with the Swedes on money, the Union hopes it has 'front-loaded a
bandwagon', as one EU negotiator put it, on which the other three applicants
yesterday sought to clamber.
By early yesterday evening Finland settled, too, for a deal that looked as
though it had declared the entire country an Arctic region eligible for
special agriculture support. During the night the Union had all but
conceded, but carefully camouflaged this in a way politically and culturally
unacceptable to the very straightforward Finns. 'There is a little bit of
mist in it and they don't like that,' acknowledged Mr Piet Dankert, the
Dutch European affairs minister.
Austria came next following an agreement over its demand for restrictions on
EU trucks transiting its Alpine passes.
The bandwagon effect was such that even Norway, the most obdurate candidate,
whose ministers left the talks at dawn expecting to try again with EU
foreign ministers next Monday, returned to the negotiations.
Not every EU member state was delighted by the fiscally-induced
breakthrough. The Spanish, French and Dutch thought the applicants were
being alowed to get away with highway robbery. They and others criticised
the current Greek president of the EU Council, Mr Theodoros Pangalos, for
running a bazaar, and Germany for behaving more like the applicants' lawyer
than an EU member.
But as the chaotic talks headed for the rocks early this morning, Mr
Pangalos refused to admit defeat, Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission
president, appeared like a deus ex machina with an extra Ecu750m to provide
more incentives for the applicants, and Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign
minister, seized control of the negotiations.
'Germany played a very crucial role,' a senior Swedish negotiator
acknowledged. For instance, the Germans worked hard to satisfy the Finns by
ridding their agriculture text of the normal Euro-ambiguities which so appal
the literal-minded Nordics, while keeping it - just - within Euro-rules.
In a rather bolder move, Germany locked up Norwegian and Spanish negotiators
to argue about fish, presumably hoping to endorse the views of whoever came
out alive. Spain wants 14,000 tonnes of cod or equivalent from Norway's
richly endowed and carefully husbanded waters. Oslo, as one Spanish
negotiator put it, is sticking to its 'NASF (not a single fish) formula.
They won't give an inch.'
There was, last night, undeniable momentum at last behind the EU's drive to
embrace the new candidates and begin the drive for a 'wider Europe'. The
risk remained, however, that Norway would continue to play hard-to-get in
view of the EU's obvious eagerness to it in. 'Both sides consider the other
side as the demandeur, a Dutch diplomat remarked as the talks started at the
weekend.

A decision by Moscow's mayor to introduce a new tax on the country's only
and fledgling currency market, in an effort to save the Russian capital's
treasury from ruin, has provoked angry protests from more than 100 Russian
banks.
The banks, shareholders and members of the Moscow inter-bank currency
exchange, said the 0.1 per cent tax on the volume of all deals would push
business away from Moscow to provincial currency markets.
The move would also be self-defeating, reducing overall tax revenues from
the exchange, and be a new burden on exporters, the banks said.
About Dollars 12.6bn, or a third of Russia's export earnings, were sold on
the exchange last year. The exchange, the country's first and the main venue
for central bank interventions to support the rouble, accounts for 80 per
cent of foreign exchange dealing in Russia.
However, Mayor Yuri Luzhkoz, was insisting yesterday that the city would
soon have no cash even for rubbish removal unless the government honoured
debts of tens of millions of dollars.
He told a municipality meeting that the government owed Rbs250bn to city
authorities but that the acting finance minister, Mr Sergei Dubinin, was
refusing to pay.
'The government has paid nothing to Moscow to help it function as the
capital of Russia. It hasn't given a single kopeck for the construction of
new metro lines. We might as well move the capital to somewhere else.'
Russia is in a chronic non-payments crisis as the government, state
enterprises, companies and individuals all owe each other money but no one
pays.
Amid this crisis, the finance ministry is trying to delay some payments as
it puts together a 1994 budget which is already stretched to cover trillions
of roubles promised by the government to ailing industries.
'The Russian leadership is like a gypsy who hasn't been feeding his horse
for a long time,' said Mr Luzhkov. 'It then decides the horse shouldn't be
fed at all. Finally the horse dies.'
Russia's gas company Gazprom said yesterday it would halt supplies to
Ukraine this week because payments had not been made. It also accused Kiev
of stealing gas from export pipelines crossing its territory, Reuter reports
from Moscow.
'We intend to cut off gas supplies from March 3 if Ukraine does not take any
steps,' said Gazprom's chief engineer, Mr Vladimir Podmarkov.
Ukraine, which is suffering acute fuel shortages, depends on Russia for most
of its oil and gas, but has been unable to pay for supplies.
In Kiev, a Ukrainian gas industry official doubted that Gazprom would carry
out its cut-off threat, which could lead to further tapping into export
pipelines by fuel-starved Ukrainian enterprises.
'Russia won't dare cut supplies completely,' said Mr Bohdan Babiy, chief
engineer at the transport division of the Ukrhazprom company. Previous
experience shows that our enterprises would just take the gas (meant) for
export (to western Europe) from the pipeline.'
Russia exported about 100bn cubic metres of gas outside the former Soviet
Union last year, mostly to Germany, Italy and France. More than 90 per cent
of these exports passed though Ukraine.

European Union member states could achieve nominal convergence in inflation
and interest rates by 1996, and in budget deficits by 1998, according to a
'scenario' published yesterday by the European Commission.
Its report on the European economy in the year 2000 gives a variety of
possible outcomes based on different policy assumptions.
However, the Commission warns that even a gradual path to 'convergence'
would require moderate wage increases, tough budget policies, and a
recognition that unemployment would only start falling in 1996. The jobless
rate would still be 7.5 per cent in the year 2000.
A more radical approach to labour market flexibility - including a reduction
in employers' social security contributions for low-wage earners - could cut
unemployment faster, according to the Commission.
Thus the average growth of employment could be 2 per cent, associated with
GDP growth of 3.5 per cent. Assuming that real wage costs per head remained
one point below productivity, at about 0.5 per cent per year, the
unemployment rate could fall to 4.5 per cent by the end of the decade.
'This favourable scenario, appealing as it might be, implies very stringent
requirements for public policies and private behaviour, together with the
need for strong co-ordination at the Community level,' the paper says.
If member states pursue a 'do nothing policy' and drop efforts to achieve
convergence, they risk social tensions and a return to
'beggar-thy-neighbour' policies. The EU would be 'plunged into the deeply
divergent conditions that prevailed 20 years ago' after the first oil crisis
shock, 'but with a worse social situation'.
Mr Gordon Brown, UK shadow chancellor of the exchequer, called yesterday for
a new European recovery fund to finance job-creation projects, investment
and training. Without putting a price tag on the new fund, Mr Brown said it
would bolster EU-wide efforts to tackle the next recession.
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, was sympathetic to
the idea.

Comparing Sweden's accession agreement to its nail-biting capture of the
Olympic ice hockey gold medal on Sunday may have been stretching a point for
most hockey-mad Swedes. But Mr Carl Bildt, prime minister, was unabashed in
celebrating the country's 'most important international agreement of the
century'.
The 44-year-old leader of the conservative Moderate party has made getting
traditionally neutral, aloof Sweden into the EU a central platform of his
right-centre coalition since it came to power in 1991, alongside his aim of
liberalising the huge state sector economy.
Agreement on membership terms is also an important political victory for Mr
Esko Aho, 39-year-old Finnish prime minister from the Centre party and
leader of a similarly-comprised coalition.
But both men know there remains a long way to go to secure approval in
referendums promised in both countries that will decide if they can join the
EU on January 1 next year as scheduled.
First the young prime ministers will be hoping their Nordic fellow
applicant, Norway, will also come on board, as a Norwegian decision to stay
out would undoubtedly stiffen the already strong Swedish and Finnish anti-EU
camps.
Then, both Mr Bildt and Mr Aho have to decide when to schedule referendums.
Mr Aho, whose own rurally-based party is split on the issue, favours the
autumn to give time to win over doubters.
Like Mr Aho, Mr Bildt has vital support from the opposition Social
Democratic party, which originally lodged Sweden's EU application. But he
and Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the SD leader, are set to tangle over the referendum
date.
With the latest Swedish opinion polls showing previously strong No support
shrinking to 42 per cent, and the Yes vote rising sharply to 35 per cent, Mr
Bildt is keen to hold the vote in June or on general election day in
September. The Social Democrats, however, want to wait until the autumn
believing they need more time to win over strong opposition to membership
from within party ranks.
This poses a real dilemma for Mr Bildt. Conventional wisdom dictates that a
Yes majority is impossible without a powerful SD Yes campaign. The best
conditions for a Yes vote may come if the Social Democrats, currently
leading in the polls, win power in September and hold the referendum in
October or November. But that is hardly an appealing scenario for Mr Bildt.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Czechs and Slovaks win praise for their progress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sixty years ago Czechoslovakia was among Europe's leading industrial
nations. Today the Czech Republic, as the more developed of the two parts of
the former Czechoslovak federation, ranks about equal with the European
Union's two poorest members in terms of gross domestic product per capita,
according to a report on the Czech and Slovak republics by the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development.
There is perhaps no more telling statistic for four and half decades of
communist management, and debilitating waves of migration that began before
the Second World War and ended only with the 'velvet revolution' of 1989.
The split of the federation on January 1, 1993, further reduced the economic
and political stature of its constituent republics.
The whole was greater than the sum of its parts, and both have had to adjust
to living separately.
The OECD report shows both countries suffered from the split, though
adjustment costs have been far heavier for Slovakia than for the Czechs.
The Czech Republic, with its more diversified industrial base and economy,
and close proximity to western markets, adapted more easily, though it has
yet to pull out of recession. Slovakia, with its dependence on heavy
industry and armaments aimed at eastern markets, was doubly hit by the
collapse of its trading partners in the former Comecon trade bloc, and the
loss of financial transfers from the federation. It has also had to build an
administration almost from scratch.
Nevertheless, both have made considerable progress in their transition to
market economies, the OECD says.
The report praises the Czech Republic for its reforms. Macroeconomic
stability has been maintained with underlying inflation at around 10 per
cent and 'lower than in any other post-communist economy in transition'; the
state budget is practically balanced and the current account is in surplus.
Output has continued to stagnate, but the economy appears 'set to start on a
path of slow expansion in 1994, that may accelerate in 1995'. Growth is
forecast at 2 per cent this year and 5 per cent in 1995, with exports rising
10 per cent. But, it warns, 'the transition is far from complete, and much
potentially disruptive restructuring remains to be done'. The reintroduction
of wage controls in July was a step backwards. Unemployment may double to 8
per cent this year.
The OECD is more cautious about Slovakia, though it argues that the economy
is already showing a number of positive features. The private sector
accounts for 35-40 per cent of economic activity, and government debt is low
compared with that in other eastern European and some OECD countries.
But immediate prospects are poor. A decline in aggregate output of 5 per
cent last year is likely to be followed by stagnation this year, with growth
of 2 per cent only resuming in 1995. Unemployment is set to rise to 18 per
cent of the workforce this year, and inflation will fall only slowly from 25
per cent in 1993 to 20 per cent this year.
The budget deficit is likely to remain at around 5 per cent of GDP, and
limited domestic financial resources make reducing the deficit more urgent.
Expenditure on arms production and defence should be reduced.
Political uncertainty has deterred foreign investment, says the report,
which urges the government to develop a coherent set of policies for
stabilisation and structural reform. Some of the report's statistics
compiled before the end of 1993 are already out of date but the main trends
remain in place, and as the first comprehensive study of the two countries
since they went their separate ways the OECD has usefully begun the job of
clearing the air about the real state of the two economies.

If Steven Spielberg had directed Schindler's List when he bought the rights
to Thomas Keneally's book in 1982, two weeks after the US opening of ET, it
would have been a movie not a film, he said yesterday.
As things turned out, it became a document 'rich in incident and
information', or even 'a Holocaust Museum at 24 frames a second'. And if it
is a success by his personal reckoning, and educates people (a financial
bonanza goes without saying) 'then this picture is a public service'.
Speaking hours before last night's German premiere, he could not but be
aware that it was already having such an effect. The face of the main
character, the un-saintly Oskar Schindler, had two weeks earlier appeared on
the front cover of the mass-circulation news magazine Der Spiegel, with the
cover-line, 'The Good German'.
It came as a mild relief to a country recently confronted with vile images
of neo-Nazis burning out and killing refugees, defacing Jewish cemeteries,
and reviving notions worldwide that 'the ugly German' was the sole and true
representative of the nation.
Awareness has since spread that the Jewish-American box-office king, with a
history as a specialist in the ludicrously sentimental, had presented a
work, harsh, true and uncompromising, but free of caricature and cliche.
Speaking in the home town of Oskar Schindler, the libertine National
Socialist party member and industrialist who saved more than 1,000 Jews from
death in wartime German extermination camps, Mr Spielberg reminded his
audience of mainly German and central European journalists that last year 60
per cent of US school children had not heard the word 'holocaust'.
The same cannot be said of German youth, but it won him warm applause from
journalists who have already taken up the public service cause with a
vengeance. A front page editorial in the influential Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung said yesterday the 'profoundly unideological' work had a chance to
reach an audience far wider than the 'selected public' usually reached by
'often very important documentaries'.
Mr Spielberg, who watched it again last night in the presence of President
Richard von Weizsacker, was himself inspired to start work by film and
videotape images transmitted relentlessly out of Bosnia.
He was still putting the finishing touches to another blockbuster movie,
Jurassic Park. 'But when I first heard the words 'ethnic cleansing', it
shattered me and I decided to rush into production,' he said.
He braced himself for the realities of filming in Auschwitz, arriving with
'a chip on my shoulder' and spent four months at work in 'a cemetery'. His
children learnt how to speak Polish and eat herring. He himself eventually
learnt to speak civilly to young German actors in Nazi uniforms, and he
heard from them that the work in progress was 'the best thing that could
happen to their generation'.
He could not say if Germany was ready to face the past, as he was asked by a
young journalist last night. He could not say why more Jews did not resist
being driven to the 'asphyxiation rooms'. Perhaps these were subjects for
future films. 'This is about education, awareness and consciousness. . . .
and I hope it is not the end of motion pictures about the Shoah,' he said.

FT  02 MAR 94 / 'New primitives' drive Serb professionals abroad: Those who
cannot abide the profiteers and extremists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE

<TEXT>
From ballerinas and basketball players to electronics experts and surgeons,
the rump Yugoslavia's professional class is being decimated by emigration.
While no official figures are available, more than 100,000 Serbs are
believed to have left the country since the collapse of the Yugoslav
federation, many of them young men avoiding conscription.
'What's most disturbing is that those leaving are middle class people whose
skills and ideas will be crucial to rebuilding the country once UN sanctions
are lifted,' says Mr Ratomir Tanic of the Civil Alliance, a democratic
opposition party.
South Africa and Zimbabwe, where immigration regulations are comparatively
relaxed, have attracted the largest numbers of Serbian emigrants. Getting to
Canada and the US, where there are well-established expatriate communities
from the former Yugoslavia, is more difficult except for students, say
would-be migrants.
Most young migrants are university students, but some Serbian parents are
spending their hard currency savings to send teenaged children abroad to
finish their secondary education under exchange programmes which have not
been affected by the UN embargo.
'School in Belgrade is getting impossible. You can't get there because the
buses aren't running; kids mess around in class because they don't see any
future in studying and the teachers can't handle it. I want to get out,'
says Ms Ljubica Petrovic, 16, who hopes to finish high school in Canada.
Yet just before Yugoslavia broke apart, prospects for professionals had
rarely looked brighter, under a short-lived reformist government that tried
to promote private business, fiscal modernisation and the restructuring of
the banking system.
However, the impact of UN sanctions has been almost as devastating for the
fledgling private sector as for large state enterprises, where managers'
responsibilities have virtually disappeared as exports halted and workers
were sent home on 'technical leave'.
Hyper-inflation in Serbia and Montenegro eroded savings and forced families
to sell their assets to finance their children's studies abroad, at the same
time removing any incentive for private investment.
The government's new economic programme, which imposes much higher taxes on
private businesses, is expected to drive more people away.
'I don't think there's any understanding of what small entrepreneurs have
been trying to do to keep things running despite sanctions,' says Mrs
Mirjana Blagojevic, a travel agent who used to work for JAT, the former
Yugoslav national carrier. 'The new taxes will wipe out practically all my
profit margin and may send me into retirement abroad.'
The increasing influence of what Belgrade's professional class calls the
'new primitives', the profiteers making money out of sanctions-breaking and
the war in Bosnia and the self-avowed nationalists who have taken senior
jobs in the public administration, has also speeded up the exodus.
'Whether it's the universities, the medical system or the media, there's no
pretence of jobs on merit any more. They mostly go to people close to the
socialists (of President Slobodan Milosevic),' Mr Tanic says. 'In business,
we're moving towards a Latin American situation of powerful criminal groups
effectively controlling the economy.'
The rump Yugoslavia's isolation has already affected the quality of medical
services, for example, although drugs and medical supplies are exempt from
sanctions.
The Child Heart Foundation, set up in Belgrade two years ago to carry out
open-heart surgery, is struggling to survive. Its founder, Dr Vladimir
Hrujak, says two members of his team have found jobs abroad, while funding
has been cut.
'It's a battle to keep going, professionally. In this branch of medicine you
need to keep in close touch with what's happening abroad and I can't do that
any longer. I might be able to get a medical job somewhere abroad, but I
wouldn't be doing heart operations any longer,' Dr Hrujak says.

International bond and stock markets fell heavily yesterday after a closely
watched US economic index showed some sharp increases in manufacturing
costs.
At the same time, the US government reported that gross domestic product in
the final quarter of last year rose at a revised real annual rate of 7.5 per
cent, far above the 5.9 per cent preliminary estimate and the largest
quarterly expansion since the first three months of 1984.
The bond market, however, was far more influenced by the price data from the
National Association of Purchasing Managers monthly survey. Although its
composite index fell only slightly to 56.6 per cent from 57.7 per cent in
January, indicating continued healthy expansion, the association's price
index surged to 67 per cent from 59.8 per cent the previous month.
Renewed inflation fears left the US benchmark 30-year bond down more than 1
1/2 points by late afternoon, with the yield rising to 6.782 per cent. It
was the largest one-day decline in US bond prices for six months. European
bond markets fell sharply on the back of the US sell-off.
New York traders said investors were selling bonds because they believed any
sign of resurgent inflation would increase the likelihood of another
monetary policy tightening by the Federal Reserve. The US central bank last
tightened policy by pushing up short-term interest rates on February 4.
The selling in the bond market spread to the stock market, where investors
were equally perturbed by the prospect of another Fed rate rise. At one
stage the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down more than 40 points, but by
the close it had rallied to end down 22.79 at 3,809.23.
The setback in bond markets drove share prices lower in London in an
effective rerun of Thursday's rout. The FT-SE 100 Index closed at the lowest
point of the day, down 57.5 at 3,270.6. Trading volume in the stock market
remained fairly moderate, however, and the pressure again focused on stock
index futures.
Continental equity markets were also heavily marked down after the US
figures, with the CAC-40 index in Paris retreating more than 2 per cent and
the German Dax index of leading shares sliding 1 per cent during official
hours and another 2 per cent in after-hours trading.
The revised US GDP figures brought real annual growth to 3 per cent in 1993,
the best since the 3.9 per cent of 1988. More than half of the upward
revision was accounted for by exports, which grew at a 20.5 per cent annual
rate in the quarter and outstripped the recalculated 16.2 per cent expansion
in imports.
The overall thrust of the Purchasing Managers survey was also bullish. The
report noted that 'the strength in new orders strongly suggests future
continued growth, but very likely at a lower, more sustainable level'.
Increases in prices, it said, were 'primarily in products whose prices were
severely depressed', such as aluminium, brass, copper, nickel and zinc.
Of the component parts of the index, both new orders and the backlog in
orders grew in February, but at a lower rate than in January.
New export orders rose to the highest level in 4 1/2 years, while import
orders also grew, but at a lower rate than in plier deliveries were at the
highest level since June 1988, indicating strong demand from manufacturers.
The government's GDP report for the final quarter also showed broad-based
strength, together with low inflation.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Car output at highest level for nearly 20 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British car production last year reached its highest level since 1974, with
Rover moving further ahead of Ford as the UK's largest carmaker.
Rover's output of cars last year totalled 408,804, compared with Ford's
271,793, although the latter's total rises to 301,380 when Jaguar output is
included. In 1992, Rover produced 378,797 cars, compared with a combined
total of 322,946 cars from Ford and Jaguar.
Statistics from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show that the
UK's total car output last year reached 1.38m, nearly 7 per cent higher than
in 1992 and the highest since the 1.53m units reached in 1974.
However, this was in contrast to commercial vehicle output, which declined
further to the lowest level since 1958, mainly as a result of a steep drop
in demand in Continental Europe.
The figures emerged as Ford announced that short-time working had ended at
its Transit van plant at Southampton, and that output of Escorts from its
Halewood plant on Merseyside was being increased as a result of continuing
recovery in the UK vehicle market.
Ford produced 127,065 light commercial vehicles, compared with only 19,940
by Rover.
Total car output last year continued on its rising trend, up 6.47 per cent
to 1,375,524 units, the highest since 1974. This was in spite of lower
output at Vauxhall and Peugeot.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Progress on N Ireland unlikely before Euro elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

The government has virtually given up hope of making further significant
headway in forging a lasting political settlement in Northern Ireland before
the European elections in June.
This follows Monday's announcement by the Ulster Unionists, the province's
largest political party, that it would not return to round-table talks with
Dublin and other constitutional parties.
Mr James Molyneaux, the UUP leader, urged the government to concentrate on
setting up an internal Ulster assembly - a proposal likely to be vetoed by
Mr John Hume's mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party.
London's pessimism over the immediate prospects for further progress emerged
at Westminster last night as in the US Mr John Major voiced his
determination to press ahead with the search for a comprehensive settlement.
The prime minister's reaffirmation of the so-called three-stranded approach
came after President Bill Clinton carefully avoided questions on whether the
US administration would again allow Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, to
visit the US.
However, speaking at the White House after talks with Mr Major, Mr Clinton
again offered public support for last December's Anglo-Irish declaration as
the framework for eventual peace in Northern Ireland. Senior British
officials interpreted this as a clear signal that Mr Adams would in future
be barred from the US unless and until Sinn Fein renounced IRA violence.
Ministers have interpreted the UUP's announcement as in effect the start of
a three-month period of political manoeuvring in the run-up to the European
elections.
The UUP is anxious to protect its flank against Rev Ian Paisley's hardline
Democratic Unionist party, which is boycotting bilateral talks with London
co-ordinated by Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister.
Mr Major refused to accept that the UUP's disavowal of an Anglo-Irish
dimension to a settlement meant the process was doomed.
The Anglo-Irish liaison committee responsible for exchanging ideas on
political progress in Ulster has met once since Mr Major and Mr Albert
Reynolds, Irish prime minister, agreed last month to put renewed emphasis on
the joint talks.
Efforts were under way at Westminster last night to arrange a meeting
between Mr Molyneaux and Mr Ancram at which the UUP leader would be asked to
clarify his position.
Expectations are high at Westminster that further moves to set up a select
committee for Northern Ireland will take place before the end of this month.
This would be welcomed by unionists.

FT  02 MAR 94 / EU to grow as Sweden, Finland and Austria agree entry terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Sweden, Finland and Austria agreed terms to join the European Union
yesterday after five days and three nights of arduous talks, putting
pressure on Norway, too, to settle its negotiations.
The EU and Austria clinched a deal last night when they agreed on
restrictions on pollution-generating EU lorries using Austrian Alpine roads.
Sweden set the bandwagon rolling after all-night talks nearly collapsed at
dawn yesterday. By lunchtime the Swedes had settled, helped by strong German
pressure on its EU partners to get a deal done. Finland and Austria followed
suit with their separate agreements.
Hopes grew that Norway, which has been resisting EC access to its rich
fishing grounds, could make a final decision when EU foreign ministers meet
in Brussels next Monday.
Sweden's terms for EU membership were welcomed by the main government and
opposition parties, as well as industrial and business organisations.
'On all points the EU has taken into account our interests,' said Mr Carl
Bildt, the prime minister. Mr Ingvar Carlsson, leader of the opposition
Social Democratic party, said: 'In most areas we have reached a good or a
very good result.'
But opponents of Swedish membership, currently ahead of the Yes camp in
opinion polls, served notice they would campaign hard against joining the EU
in a referendum later this year. The accession agreement 'means we cannot
preserve our neutrality and that we accept the EU's economic policy', said
Mr Hans Lindquist, leader of the No to Europe organisation.
Mr Esko Aho, Finnish prime minister, was more restrained than Mr Bildt. He
said the deal 'is of course not such a one that we aimed at . . . but if the
details of the agreement prove to be such as we assume I do not find it
impossible to live with this agreement'. He added: 'One should not jump for
joy.'
The breakthrough came after the EU agreed to phase in Swedish contributions
to the Brussels budget. The EU raised the value of the sweeteners it offered
all four applicants from Ecu2.8bn to Ecu3.6bn (Pounds 2.8bn) over four
years, mostly to cushion the impact of the cut in applicant countries' farm
prices to EU levels.
The prospect of at least a 15-member EU depends not only on referendums in
the applicant countries but on the current 12 member states' ability to
resolve an internal row over how to adjust voting rules to accommodate the
newcomers.
EU officials said phone contacts were taking place between Chancellor Helmut
Kohl of Germany, President Francois Mitterrand of France and Mr Felipe
Gonzalez, Spanish premier, to try to resolve this dispute, which could hold
up the newcomers' planned entry next January.
In its deal, Austria got EU blessing to continue restricting EU trucks using
its Alpine passes until 2001, three years less than Vienna wanted.
But if pollution levels have not fallen then by at least 40 per cent, the
curbs will run for a further three years. By then, both sides hope much of
this traffic will have moved onto the railways - possibly assisted by EU
funding.
The European Parliament has to approve the accession treaty by May 4 to make
the 1995 entry date possible.

FT  02 MAR 94 / Inkatha deal with ANC lifts S Africa poll hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DURBAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa's two black political rivals last night stepped back from the
brink of violent conflict when Mr Nelson Mandela, African National Congress
leader, persuaded Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi to register his Inkatha
party for the first all-race elections in April.
Speaking after more than eight hours of talks with the ANC leader at a
Durban hotel, Chief Buthelezi stressed that his party's decision to register
did not guarantee its participation in the April 27 elections.
Inkatha would register only 'provisionally' - a final decision on
participation would depend on the outcome of international mediation of
South Africa's constitutional dispute.
The ANC last night agreed to such mediation in principle, although no
details were agreed about the identity of the mediating parties or whether
mediation would be binding.
Asked whether Inkatha was closer to participating in the election after the
meeting than before it, Chief Buthelezi replied: 'Not at all.' But he
stressed that Inkatha would participate if its constitutional demands were
met. His decision to allow Inkatha's name to be printed on ballot papers is
also likely to have a psychological effect on polling.
The intervention of Mr Mandela, who has not previously been involved in
face-to-face constitutional talks with Inkatha leaders, appeared to have
made it possible to avert an immediate start to a violent boycott campaign
by Inkatha.
After weeks of public acrimony, the accord holds out at least the hope that
a constitutional settlement will include Inkatha, a party with a strong
following among the Zulus, who number 9m out of the country's 38m
population.
The two men made a show of friendship. Emerging from 45 minutes of private
talks before the general session began, they held hands and posed smiling
for the cameras. After the day-long session, they addressed a joint press
conference and deferred to one another politely in answering reporters'
questions.
'I came in high spirits and I leave in higher spirits. I feel very warm
inside,' said Mr Mandela.
Chief Buthelezi implied that Inkatha would seek an extension of the election
period - possibly by delaying the poll in the Zulu heartland Natal while
proceeding with the national election elsewhere on April 27 as planned. 'It
would only be fair if we were given a little space to campaign,' Chief
Buthelezi said. The ANC is unlikely to accept any delay.
However genuine the commitment to seek a substantive deal, both sides were
clearly keen to use yesterday's accord to avoid blame for future violence.
Inkatha must complete its 'provisional' registration by Friday to qualify
for election participation.

FT  02 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee and cocoa steady - Market
Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Commodity Exchange COCOA and COFFEE futures showed steady gains
yesterday after Monday's sharp declines, but traders described trading as
'unenthusiastic'. May delivery cocoa ended Pounds 7 up at 917 a tonne after
dipping to Pounds 905 early on. Most traders thought support at Pounds 900
was likely to hold, though some thought a slide to Pounds 870 possible
unless fresh outright buying returned.
The coffee market enjoyed light support from a further drop in US certified
stocks and the May price closed at Dollars 1,223 a tonne, up Dollars 10.
At the London Metal Exchange COPPER set a generally lower tone.

FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: ITV companies to merge sales
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Carlton Communications says it intends to integrate its airtime sales
operation with that of Central. The move marks the start of reorganisations
among advertising sales houses following the series of ITV company mergers.
The new sales operation following Carlton's takeover of Central will be led
by Mr Martin Bowley, sales director of Carlton Television.
Until now, Central's airtime has been sold by TSMS, a joint venture with
Anglia Television. But Anglia in turn has been acquired by MAI, which
controls Meridian Broadcasting, the ITV company for the south of England.
The Department of Trade and Industry has insisted as a condition of agreeing
to the takeovers without a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission that no sales house should have more than 25 per cent of the
television advertising market.

FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: TI expands in Asia with Singapore deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TI Group, the specialist engineering concern, said yesterday it had reached
agreement with the Sembawang Group, a leading Singapore-based industrial
conglomerate, to develop business opportunities in the Asia Pacific region.
The agreement is an important step for TI, which is keen to expand in Asia.
The group and its associated companies already have sales of Pounds 100m in
nine countries, including India and New Zealand.
The two companies were introduced by Singapore's Economic Development Board
and signed a memorandum of understanding last month. Initially they will
focus on developing business opportunities in Singapore and China.
TI is also talking to Sembawang to explore opportunities for the Dowty
aerospace business in south-east Asia.
The deal is the first such arrangement made by TI in Asia, although it does
have a growing presence in the region. Its John Crane offshoot has had a
Japanese joint venture for 25 years, and in 1991 bought a majority stake in
Dover Japan, now called Japan Marine Technologies, to help it exploit the
Asian market for marine seals.
As part of its regionalisation, the EDB has been encouraging local and
international companies to combine resources to tackle the expanding
regional market.

<TEXT>
Vard, the Norwegian cruise and ferry group, yesterday reported substantially
heavier losses for 1993 with a pre-tax deficit of NKr361.04m (Dollars
48.75m), against NKr229.47m a year earlier.
Vard blamed its debt burden on a substantially weaker performance by Kloster
Cruise, its cruise unit, and heavier foreign currency losses.
Group operating profit rose to NKr568.86m from NKr459.33m. Revenue increased
to NKr7.3bn from NKr5.47bn, but operating expenses swelled to NKr6.24bn from
NKr4.67bn following a jump in depreciation to NKr494m from NKr341m.
Vard charged net financial items and foreign currency losses of NKr841.73m
against NKr589.38m in charges the previous year.
Miami-based Kloster Cruise said net contributions from the ships in its
fleet rose to Dollars 294m from Dollars 248m in the previous year, but that
financial expenses had increased to Dollars 89.1m from Dollars 56.3m. Net
losses, before currency adjustments and other items, more than tripled to
Dollars 19.5m from Dollars 6.4m.
Kloster's Norwegian Cruise Line's load factor for 1993 was very
satisfactory, Vard said, and surpassed the previous year.
However, prices achieved were not sufficient to compensate fully for larger
interest costs and depreciations.
Royal Viking Line's load factor was unchanged but prices fell due to
stronger competition. Royal Cruise Line improved load factors and prices,
but this was undermined by maintenance and repair costs. A plan to sell
Royal Cruise and Royal Viking for Dollars 565m fell through earlier this
year.
The ferry division saw net profits plunge to NKr78.6m from NKr123.7m,
despite a rise in operating income to NKr772.6m from NKr672.8m.
Operating expenses rose to NKr458m from NKr342.3m. Vard said the division's
results were, however, satisfactory.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Another Keating minister quits: Grants scheme administration
is called 'deficient'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paul Keating's Labor government yesterday suffered its third senior
ministerial resignation in as many months, when Ms Ros Kelly, who held the
sports, environment and territories portfolio, announced she was quitting.
Ms Kelly has been battling allegations she gave preference to marginal Labor
electorates when administering a ADollars 30m (Dollars 21.5m) sports and
cultural grants scheme before last year's general election. She has
maintained no impropriety occurred but has been unable to produce
substantial evidence explaining how the grants were made.
Senator Graham Richardson will take over most of Ms Kelly's duties, while
retaining his health portfolio. The government thus avoids another cabinet
reshuffle. Mr Keating will resume responsibility for the 'status of women'.
A parliamentary committee yesterday described Ms Kelly's administration of
the sports and cultural grants scheme as 'deficient. The minister did not
approach the minimum standard in relation to supporting her decisions with
documented reasons,' it said, but fell short of censuring her. Five
opposition committee members issued a dissenting report, accusing the
government members of shortening the inquiry.
The dissidents claimed: 'It is beyond reasonable doubt that (the) programme
has been used and refined as a part of the government's marginal-seat
election strategy and that the grants were used to seek electoral
advantage'. They said the minister should be censured.
In December, Mr John Dawkins quit as treasurer, as did Mr Alan Griffiths,
industry minister, in January.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Deals struck on east German coal and power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's three largest energy utilities yesterday announced agreement to
take over the lion's share of east Germany's power generating and coal
mining industries, in two deals valued at more than DM10bn (Dollars 5.6bn).
The deals are the climax of two years of often bitter and complex
negotiations with the Treuhand privatisation agency and the German
government.
The big three - Essen-based RWE, PreussenElektra, owned by Veba, and
Munich-based Bayernwerk - will jointly own 75 per cent of Veag, the main
east German electricity company, with the remaining 25 per cent going to
five smaller western utilities. The purchase price is around DM8bn.
The takeover of the giant Lausitz brown coal fields (Laubag), for a price of
DM2.1bn, will involve the shareholders in a further investment of DM6bn over
the next 20 years, according to Mr Friedhelm Gieske, RWE's chief executive.
The Rheinbraun subsidiary of RWE will be the 51 per cent majority
shareholder in Laubag, with PreussenElektra taking 30 per cent, and
Bayernwerk 15 per cent. RWE Energie will hold the balance.
The deals were announced in Bonn after a meeting of government and industry
leaders chaired by Chancellor Helmut Kohl. They represent the final step in
privatising the entire east German energy industry. Last year, the Treuhand
agreed the sale of the other main brown coal mining operation, Mibrag, to an
Anglo-American consortium involving Britain's PowerGen, NRG Energy of
Minneapolis, and Morrison Knudsen of Idaho.
The whole process was delayed by legal challenges from east German local
authorities, who sought to control a larger share of the lucrative power
generation industry themselves. The states of Saxony and Brandenburg are
still seeking a bigger say in the operations.
Veag supplies some 70 per cent of east German electricity, primarily from
brown coal-fired power stations. It had a turnover of DM6.4bn in 1992, and
made profits of just DM7.5m. Since 1990, its workforce has been halved to
around 14,500.
Mr Gieske confirmed the planned investment of DM6bn in Veag over the next 20
years, to provide an eventual capacity of 7,200MW.
He said that the five Laubag opencast mines would be modernised and kept in
operation and five closed. The total workforce of 12,000 would be reduced to
8,000 by the year 2000. The mines would eventually produce 50-55m tonnes of
coal, compared with current capacity of some 75m tonnes.
Contracts for the two deals are to be signed by the middle of the year,
according to yesterday's announcement. Then the utilities will have to make
a downpayment on the DM2.1bn purchase price for Laubag, followed by further
payments in the course of operation. Payments for Veag will also be spread
over 20 years.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: China seen pushing copper
market into supply deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China's huge appetite for copper would help the market in the western world
move to a supply shortage this year after two years of surpluses, according
to Mr Richard Osborne, chairman of Asarco, the US metals group.
He said yesterday that, although government measures to control inflation in
China were forecast to cut the annual growth in its copper consumption from
an average of 12.5 per cent since 1989 to 3 per cent this year, the
republic's imports of the metal would grow by twice that rate, from 330,000
short tons (2,000lb each) last year to 350,000 tons.
Meanwhile, Asarco predicted exports to the west by Poland would rise from
281,000 tons to 295,000 tons but Russian exports were likely to slip from
325,000 to 281,000 tons. This would give a modest fall in net imports to the
west, from 269,000 to 262,000 tons.
Asarco expected copper consumption outside the former eastern bloc countries
to grow by nearly 3 per cent in 1994, from just over 10m tons last year to
10.36m tons, while production of refined copper was predicted to go up by
only 0.6 per cent, from 9.94m to 10m tons.
This would leave a supply deficit of 61,000 tons compared with surpluses of
140,000 tons last year and 35,000 tons in 1992.
Mr Osborne, at a meeting with investment managers and analysts in London,
predicted copper stocks in the west, at present equivalent to seven weeks
consumption, would start coming down towards the five weeks with which the
industry was comfortable.
Dealing with other some metals, Mr Osborne forecast that the lead market
would also move to a supply deficit this year - one of 20,000 tons - after
surpluses of 131,000 tons in 1993 and 168,000 tons in 1992.
On the other hand, the zinc market was forecast to show a surplus for the
fifth consecutive year: one of 124,000 tons against 460,000 tons in 1993 and
450,000 tons in 1992.
Mr Osborne pointed out that demand for silver had outpaced supply for the
past five years and suggested that the excess stocks built up in the 1980s
would be eliminated in two years. Asarco would not re-open its three silver
mines until there was a long-term silver price of Dollars 7 a troy ounce.
'The odds on that happening are improving each month. Perhaps we will see
that before the decade is out.'

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Reuters, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the French futures exchange,
Matif, are on the verge of an agreement that could prolong the life of
Globex, the computerised international futures dealing system. The
agreement, as negotiated in New York last week, would effectively deal the
Chicago Board of Trade out of the system.
Reuters has been seeking revisions to the existing Globex governance
agreement for more than a year, and has become frustrated at the CBoT's
failure to support Globex's expansion. The CBoT and the CME have joint
responsibility for running Globex, which represents a Dollars 100m
investment by Reuters.
The CBoT could give notice it is quitting the system as early as March 22.
In the CBoT's absence, the CME, allied with the Matif, is trying to
construct an open-ened governance model that would attract other exchanges,
like London's Liffe, to Globex.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Government Bonds: German repo move sparks tentative recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
After last week's sell-off, most European government bond markets firmed
slightly yesterday. However, with long-term investors still sidelined and
cash dealings thin, dealers said the consolidation remains fragile.
German government bonds sparked the early rally, fuelled by hopes for
imminent credit easing after the Bundesbank called for bids on variable-rate
securities repurchase agreements.
After three months of freezing the repo rate at 6 per cent, the central
bank's return to variable-rate repos - where banks bid what they are willing
to pay - raised hopes that the repo rate could continue to edge lower.
However, dealers were split over the likely extent of the easing at today's
repo allocation. While some expect the rate to fall by between five and 10
basis points, others said banks might bid very cautiously given recent money
market tightness.
Bidding is further complicated by the fact that the Bundesbank's lower
minimum reserve requirement takes effect today, releasing substantial
liquidity.
Bunds' strength was underpinned by strength in the US Treasury market on
encouraging comments from Federal Reserve Board governor Lawrence Lindsey.
However, traders started taking profits in the afternoon, dragging taking
the March Bund future back below 97.00, which is seen to make it technically
vulnerable to the downside.
Comments from Bundesbank council member Mr Otmar Issing exacerbated late
weakness. In an interview with AP-Dow Jones, he said January M3 money supply
could be in the double digits, well outside the Bundesbank's 4-6 per cent
target range. The numbers are expected to be released in the second half of
this week.
A further pressure on bunds was impending supply, with the Treuhandanstalt
due to issue new bonds today. Most traders expect some DM10bn of 10-year
paper, but say it is likely to meet a lukewarm reception.
'Most of the bonds will probably land on banks' books - investors are still
quite wary and there's just no retail demand,' said Mr Torsten Bohler,
senior bond analyst at UBS.
French government bonds tracked Bunds higher, inspired by hopes that a lower
German repo rate might give the Bank of France fresh scope for easing after
last week's small 0.10 point cut in the intervention rate, to 6.10 per cent.
The March notional OAT future rose 0.92 point to 126.96, though it fell back
to around 126.76 in after-hours trading.
UK gilts held on to most of their gains, with the March long gilt future
closing at 113 7/16 , up  5/8 point on the day. 'It was a quiet day - we saw
some buying, but not in great size,' said a gilt salesman at a large UK
bank.
Japanese government bonds held on to their soft tone ahead of today's
release of the Bank of Japan's quarterly Tankan economic report, and the
auction of 10-year bonds. Mr James Greener, economist at Toyo Trust, said he
expected some Y1,200bn of 4.1 per cent 10-year bonds to be sold. 'Retail
demand is likely to be very slack - especially after the disappointing
four-year auction last week.'
US Treasury prices firmed across the board yesterday in the wake of a report
from Chicago-area purchasing managers viewed as bullish for bonds.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/2 at 94
21/32 , yielding 6.661 per cent. The two-year note was also higher, up  3/32
at 99 29/32 , to carry a yield of 4.658 per cent.
After firming overnight, thanks to buying in Tokyo, prices were boosted by
the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago's February report when
trading opened in New York. The report showed that the February index of
business activity in the region rose from 59.6 per cent to 60.3 per cent
last month. Although an increase had been expected, what pleased bond
dealers and investors was a decline in the price and employment components
of the purchasing managers' index.
Traders said the data might normally have had little impact on the market.
However, with bonds looking oversold in the wake of recent heavy losses, it
only took the slightest piece of good news to attract buyers, although most
of those were in the market covering short positions.
The market was also relieved that, following a worrying Philadelphia Federal
Reserve report that pointed to rising prices in the region, Chicago
purchasing managers said prices locally showed signs of easing in February.

Euro-convertible issue

Thai Farmers Bank is to raise Dollars 400m with Euro-convertible debentures
to help fund its long-term growth plans. The move comes in spite of fears
that a rush of recent issues may have temporarily saturated the market.
The bank's executive chairman, Mr Banyong Lamsam, said there was still
enough demand from foreign and local investors to take up the issue.
He said the market's appetite for convertible debentures with a 10-year
maturity, non-convertible debentures or warrants, or a mixture would dictate
the nature of the offer.
Thai companies raised Dollars 1.4bn through Euroconvertibles in 1993,
following an easing in Thai financial regulations. However, the dubious
quality of some issues, the stalling of the local stock market, and the
increase in global interest rates may have taken much of the wind out of
this particular fund-raising channel.

FT  01 MAR 94 / International Bonds: Volatility, interest-rate uncertainty
deter borrowers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A handful of borrowers announced plans yesterday to tap the international
bond markets. However, on the whole, new issue activity remained rather
subdued in the wake of the recent turbulence in Europe's financial markets
and uncertainty over US interest rates.
Ontario Hydro, the largest electricity utility in Canada, plans to launch a
CDollars 1bn global floating-rate note (FRN) with a five-year maturity.
Merrill Lynch, the joint bookrunner, said the deal would provide investors
with the first substantial FRN offering in Canadian dollars. Ontario Hydro,
which has an Aa2/AA- credit rating, has an expected borrowing requirement of
between CDollars 2bn and CDollars 3.8bn per annum over the next three years.
Given that the US Federal Reserve has already raised short-term interest
rates, and the somewhat uncertain interest rate background, Merrill said it
expected to see demand for the FRN from investors who want exposure to
Canadian dollars, and who are expecting a similar rise in Canadian
short-term interest rates.
Waiting in the wings for more suitable market conditions is a Dollars 500m,
10-year fixed-rate Eurobond issue from the African Development Bank. The
bank is a relatively rare borrower in the international bond market: the
proceeds will be used for general treasury purposes.
Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau, known as KfW, announced yesterday it would
delay the launch of its much-publicised dragon bond issue until market
conditions had stabilised.
KfW, with a triple-A rating, has been planning to bring a Dollars 300m,
five-year fixed-rate dragon bond to Asian investors, but decided to delay
the issue because of the current weakness in the US Treasury bond market.
Meanwhile, undeterred by the market conditions, International
Telecommunications and Satellite Organisation (Intelsat), launched a Dollars
200m, 10-year dragon bond issue priced to yield 37 basis points over the US
Treasury bond.
Nationwide Building Society is redeeming a Pounds 300m issue of
floating-rate notes early, and is offering investors the chance to switch
into a new issue on slightly more attractive terms, which effectively gets
rid of the 5 per cent floor.
The issue was launched in 1986 and is due to mature in October 1996. It had
a coupon of one-month Libor plus 8 basis points, and had a floor of 5 per
cent.
The new issue, which will be for up to Pounds 300m, is paying a coupon of
Libor plus 10 basis points and will also mature in October 1996. Baring
Brothers, the lead manager, said there was a shortage of paper maturing in
1996.

FT  01 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: DTB lifts margin requirement
on bund future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The German futures and options exchange (DTB) has increased the margin
requirement on its government bond futures contract and its DAX stock index
future.
The move follows the recent rise in volatility in Germany's bond and stock
markets. An official said the new margin requirement took effect yesterday,
and would remain in force until further notice.
'The 30-day volatility in the bund future was higher than we had assumed
under our worst-case scenario,' the DTB said.
'Last Thursday, the (March) contract closed 108 ticks below the previous
day's close, while our worst-case scenario assumed a maximum move of only
100 ticks,' it said.
Margins represent the collateral that an investor must deposit to secure an
investment position.
The DTB's margin on the bund future was raised to DM3,000 (the equivalent of
a 120-tick move on the future) per contract from DM2,500 (100 ticks). The
margin on the DAX future was increased to DM13,000 (130 index points) from
DM11,000 (110 index points).
Europe's other large exchanges are not envisaging similar moves.
'The exchange is not planning to change its initial margin on the bund
future,' said a Liffe official, noting there was always the possibility of
making intra-day margin calls at times of high volatility. Liffe's initial
margin requirement on the bund future is currently DM2,000.
'We are constantly monitoring volatility levels to ensure the margin
requirements are appropriate, but for the moment we are not considering any
changes,' a Matif official said.

FT  01 MAR 94 / International Company News: Government subsidy bolsters
first-half earnings at Sasol
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sasol, South Africa's oil-from-coal petrochemicals producer, reaped rich
rewards from its R2.5bn investment in new chemical projects in the half-year
to December 25. The group reported a 40 per cent surge in pre-tax profit to
R1.06bn (Dollars 305m) from R759m in the same period of 1992.
The improvement was achieved through productivity gains and the rand's
weakness against the dollar, which lifted export revenues. However, the
robust performance, which saw sales climb to R4.67bn from R4.34bn, includes
an estimated R450m government subsidy at the pre-tax level.
Sasol's synthetic fuel operations are compensated for any fall in oil prices
below a floor of Dollars 21.85 a barrel, adjusted from Dollars 23 late in
1993. The subsidy has increased as international crude oil prices have sunk
to new lows of below Dollars 13 in recent months.
Mr Paul Kruger, managing director, said the investment in petrochemicals
helped lift operating margins while cost cutting had continued at the
group's mines and synthetic fuel operations.
Mr Kruger added that talks on the deregulation of the South African oil
industry were proving to be 'difficult, slow but going ahead'. He said that
progress was likely to accelerate once a new government was installed.
Operating income rose to R1.11bn from R822m. The exhaustion of tax
allowances led to a jump in tax provisions to R365.8m from R158.7m.
After-tax profit rose 16 per cent to R698.7m from R600.3m. Earnings improved
to 115.9 cents from 99 cents a share. An 11 per cent higher dividend of 42
cents against 38 cents is declared.
The group has completed the revamp of its Sasol 1 synfuel plant, now
dedicated to chemical production, and has commissioned the expansion of
Natref, the Durban oil refinery jointly owned with Total. Meanwhile,
production has started in this calendar year at Polifin, the R400m
petrochemicals joint venture with AECI, the Anglo American-owned chemicals
group.

FT  01 MAR 94 / International Company News: Pension fund offsets Comalco
fall

<TEXT>
Comalco, the integrated Australian aluminium producer which is 67 per cent
owned by the country's CRA group, yesterday has reported net profits of
ADollars 86.7m (USDollars 62.5m) for 1993, more than double the previous
year's ADollars 42.5m.
The profit was due largely to a gain of ADollars 35m from the increased
value of pension fund investments and a ADollars 24m fillip from the
reduction in Australia's company tax rate from 39 per cent to 33 per cent.
However, the group's main business operations suffered heavily from the
steep fall in 1993 metal prices. Net operating profit fell to ADollars 28m,
down 35.6 per cent from 1992's ADollars 43.5m.
Total sales of ADollars 2.2bn showed a slight improvement on the ADollars
2bn of 1992, due mainly to a rise in sales volumes in smelting and
downstream operations helped by a weaker Australian dollar.
Mr Nick Stump, group chief executive, said the company has responded to the
global oversupply of aluminium by slashing production at Bell Bay smelter in
Tasmania. Mr Stump said the plant's capacity of 120,000 tonnes a year would
be cut by 30% at the end of this month.
The excess world supply, along with aboriginal claims on Comalco's mining
leases, are threatening the short-term viability of the company's plans to
double the output of its main smelter at Boyne Island in northern
Queensland. Comalco and its partners have decided to delay the final
decision on the expansion project until March 31.
The group has declared a fully franked final dividend of 3 cents a share,
making a total of 6 cents for the year, up 1 cent.

The weak state of Japan's economy and the rise in the yen were blamed for a
32 per cent fall in parent company pre-tax profits at Sumitomo Rubber, a
leading manufacturer of tyres.
Sumitomo, which owns Dunlop in the UK, France and Germany,
said the sluggish state of Japan's car industry and increasing moves to
produce cars overseas had adversely affected demand for tyres and resulted
in pre-tax profits falling to Y8.04bn (Dollars 76.8m) in 1993 from Y11.8bn a
year earlier.

<TEXT>
Shareholders in Malaysia Airlines (MAS), the country's partially-privatised
flag carrier, have agreed to changes in its charter allowing a large stake
in the company to be sold to Malaysian Helicopter Services (MHS), at present
a company dealing mainly in support services for the Malaysian oil and gas
industry.
The way is now clear for MHS to take up a 32 per cent stake in MAS bought
late last year from Bank Negara, the Malaysian central bank, for MDollars
1.79bn (USDollars 656.5m). MHS says it intends to fund the purchase by a
public offering of new MHS shares.
MHS is a relatively small company controlled by Mr Tajudin Ramli, a close
business associate of Mr Daim Zainuddin, the former Malaysian finance
minister reputed to be one of Malaysia's most influential business people.
In recent months MHS has been on an aggressive acquisition hunt. It now has
substantial stakes in a Malaysian shipping line, 25 per cent of World
Airways, the US cargo and passenger charter company, and 18 per cent of
Pelangi Air, a small Malaysian airline.

Daiei, Japan's largest supermarket chain, has linked with Agfa-Gevaert, the
German photographic film maker, in an attempt to break into Japan's tightly
held film market with an inexpensive German-made product branded under its
own name, writes William Dawkins in Tokyo.
The film will retail at a 60 per cent discount to average photographic film
prices, said a Daiei spokesman. On the strength of this the company Daiei is
planning to achieve a market share of around a 3 per cent in the first year.
Currently, the Japanese photographic film market is dominated by Fuji, with
a 70 per cent share, followed by Kodak and Konika with just under 30 per
cent combined, and Agfa-Gevaert with less than 1 per cent.

Pancontinental Mining, the diversified Australian mining house, has emerged
as a 'white knight' for Aztec Mining Company, the Sydney-based miner
confronting an unwanted ADollars 261m (USDollars 188m) bid from Mr Robert
Champion de Crespigny's Poseidon Gold, writes Nikki Tait.
Aztec is recommending an all-paper offer from Pancontinental of six
Pancontinental shares and three Pancontinental options for every 16 Aztec
shares. The options have a strike price of ADollars 2.30 and expire at
end-June 1997.
Based on the average price for Pancontinental over the past week, the offer
is worth around ADollars 0.76 per Aztec share, valuing the company at
ADollars 292m. PosGold's cash bid is pitched at ADollars 0.68 a share.
Critically, the new offer has the backing of Aztec's major shareholder, the
US-based Alumax group, which holds 37 per cent of the shares.

reported a 113 per cent increase in net profits to Won154.8bn (Dollars 191m)

The jump in earnings reflected strong export sales by its semiconductor
division, with a 94 per cent rise in turnover to Won2,600bn.
Samsung is the world's seventh biggest manufacturer of semiconductors and
ranks first globally in the production of memory chips.
Samsung Electronics also makes consumer electronics, telecommunications

forecasts

<TEXT>
More Japanese companies have warned that their profits for the current
financial year may not match earlier forecasts.
In the case of Mitsukoshi, Japan's most prestigious department store, which
has links with Harrods of London, the pre-tax loss is expected to worsen due
to poor sales to corporate customers.
The retailer expects a non-consolidated pre-tax loss for the year to last
month to widen to Y3.5bn (Dollars 33m) from a previously forecast Y2.3bn.
Mitsukoshi expects to post its second consecutive pre-tax loss, highlighting
the problems facing Japanese department stores amid the current downturn in
the economy and the sharp fall in consumer confidence.
Department stores have also faced declines in sales due to an increase in
competition from discount retailers, especially in the clothing sector.
The company said it would post an extraordinary loss of Y5.1bn due to the
liquidation of three affiliates, Mitsukoshi Restaurant Service, a sports
club, and a Paris-based designer brand retailer.
However it will also post a special profit of Y5.8bn from assets sales,
including a workshop in central Tokyo and condominiums, which have been sold
to a real estate affiliate.
All Nippon Airways warned that it would be unable to post earlier projected
non-consolidated sales of Y782bn for the current year to March.
Mr Seiji Fukatsu, ANA president, said that, although the pre-tax profit
forecast of Y6bn would remain the same, annual sales could now total only
Y750bn.
In the telecommunications industry, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT)
foresees its unconsolidated, or parent only, pre-tax profit for the coming
fiscal year beginning April 1 falling by 1.9 per cent to Y104bn from the
Y106bn estimated earlier.
The forecast came as part of NTT's business plan for the coming fiscal year.
The company is Japan's largest carrier of telephone calls.
NTT's president, Mr Masashi Kojima, said that, even with pre-tax profit of
Y104bn for the coming fiscal year, the company would have to carry forward
profit from the current fiscal year to pay its regular dividend of Y5,000
per share.
Mr Kojima warned that the telecommunications giant wanted to raise basic
monthly phone charges and charges on telephone directory assistance
services.
Kokusai Denshin Denwa, Japan's international telecommunications company,
said it expected Y29bn in current profit in 1994-95, starting April 1, up
Y1bn from this year.
KDD said its estimate of current profits for 1993-94 has been cut to Y28bn
from a Y30bn estimate made in October last year.
KDD plans to invest Y60bn in plant and equipment in 1994-95, compared with
an estimated Y55bn for the current business year. 'We expect the
international communications market to remain firm in 1994-95,' it said.

FT  01 MAR 94 / International Company News: Newsprint prices keep Abitibi in
deficit
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Low paper prices drove Abitibi-Price, the world's biggest newsprint
producer, to its fourth consecutive year of losses in 1993.
The Toronto-based company said that newsprint prices in North America have
shown no signs of recovery so far this year. But it expressed the hope that
operating results will improve during 1994 thanks to a combination of higher
offshore prices, a 7 per cent cut in North American discounts due to take
effect today, and further price hikes later in the year as the US recovery
gathers pace.
Net losses last year totalled CDollars 121.7m (USDollars 90.1m), or CDollars
1.71 a share, a significant improvement on 1992's CDollars 220.9m deficit,
equal to CDollars 3.19 a share. The results include a narrowing in losses
from discontinued operations to CDollars 13.4m from CDollars 27.8m.
Sales rose to CDollars 1.87bn from CDollars 1.60bn. Operating losses fell to
CDollars 39.8m from CDollars 138.1m.
The smaller losses were due to a drop in the Canadian dollar, lower costs
and higher volumes. In addition, earnings from office products jumped 49 per
cent.
Analysts predict that Canadian and US newsprint producers will be able to
push through at least part of today's proposed price increase.

Kone, the Finnish elevators group, is close to finalising the sale of its
cranes unit as part of its strategy of focusing on core business. The
company is not identifying the buyer until discussions are complete.
Kone Cranes is a world leader in industrial cranes and ship-to-shore cranes.
Since it was formed in 1930, the operation has grown to span 40 companies in
20 countries.
Analysts believe the unit could fetch up to FM1bn (Dollars 181m), although
it is hard to value because the group does not specify profit figures for
individual operations.
Kone Cranes had sales of FM1.9bn in 1993, up 26 per cent.

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Panamerican Beverages (Panamco), Latin America's largest soft drinks
bottler, wants to buy minority interests in its Mexican subsidiaries.
If the offers are accepted, the purchase price would be about Dollars 500m.
It will be funded by Dollars 100m in cash and a bank loan.
Panamco is the second-largest Coca-Cola bottler in the world, with annual
sales of Dollars 957m in 1992. It plans to refinance part or all of the
purchase with a public offering of its 'A' stock. Panamco directors have
already agreed to tender their shares in the subsidiaries and stand to gain
Dollars 50m from the transaction.
Panamco has significant interests in Mexico, Brazil and Colombia,
controlling about 50 operating subsidiaries in the three countries.
Coca-Cola owns about 10 per cent of the company, but has not made it an
anchor bottler.
Panamco intends to buy up to 46 per cent of Azteca, its holding company for
Mexican operations, and outstanding shares held by minority investors in
subsidiaries controlled by Azteca. It said the price offered for shares in
Azteca and subsidiaries is equal to 13 times 1993 earnings. Neither Azteca
nor subsidiaries has publicly traded stock.
'This is an intelligent way for Panamco to take a bigger stake in their
fastest growing market,' said William Scovin, an analyst with Nomura, the
brokerage.

FT  01 MAR 94 / International Company News: Recession cuts profit at Esab to
SKr82m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Esab, the world's leading producer of welding equipment, yesterday reported
a near 50 per cent slide in 1993 profits after financial items to SKr82m
(Dollars 10m), as income fell from recession-hit Europe and a cooler
Brazilian market.
But the Swedish group said 1992 profits had been inflated by a one-off
profit of SKr99m. It said income in the fourth quarter of 1993 accounted for
more than half the income for the full year, and predicted a strong
improvement in 1994 as demand in some European countries and Brazil had
stabilised and growth continued in North America.
Sales in 1993 rose to SKr7bn from SKr6.4bn, and orders grew to SKr7.13bn
from Skr6.4bn. But Esab said these were distorted by the sharp fall last
year in the Swedish krona; taking this into account, sales fell by 4 per
cent. The company is holding its dividend at SKr3.25 per share.
Esab has faced a sharp decline in the main western European markets for
welding equipment - Germany and Italy - since 1991. But it expanded in
Russia and eastern Europe, acquiring 70 per cent of the Czech republic's
leading welding company, Zelezarny-Vamberk.
In January it also signed contracts to set up two joint ventures in China,
the largest a plant in Shanghai which will have a production capacity in
1995 of 30,000 tonnes of welding electrodes.

<TEXT>
Compaq Computer plans to spend Dollars 20m expanding its manufacturing
facilities in Houston, Texas. It is adding seven new production lines for
desktop and portable personal computers to increase production capacity by
41 per cent. The move reflects rapid growth in PC demand and Compaq's rising
market share.
The US expansion follows the recent announcement that Compaq plans to
broaden its manufacturing operation in Erskine, Scotland, with a Dollars
10.5m expansion. Last year Compaq also opened a new plant in Shenzhen,
China. The company is shortly expected to announce expansion of its
production facilities in Singapore.
The Houston expansion marks the return of portable personal computer
production to the US for the first time in two years. In 1991, the US
government imposed trade sanctions on Japanese active matrix flat panel
displays, used in notebook computers. As a result, Compaq and other US
manufacturers shifted manufacturing off-shore to avoid prohibitive 63 per
cent dumping duties.
Last March, the US government lifted the sanction, enabling Compaq to
produce portable PCs in the US cost effectively.
However, Compaq officials said their decision to expand US production was
based largely on productivity improvements and cost reductions at the
Houston plant. The company has doubled its production per square foot in the
past two years.
IBM France, the French unit of International Business Machines, expects
stable turnover in 1994, compared to 1993, Reuter reports from Paris.
Exports continued to suffer from a price war which was undermining a rise in
demand, said the company. Turnover fell 15.7 per cent in 1993 to FFr30.9bn
(Dollars 5.3bn).

FT  01 MAR 94 / International Company News: Kmart slips further into the red
in final quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kmart, the US retailing group that ranks as the world's second biggest, has
ended a dismal year by reporting after-tax losses of more than Dollars 1bn
for the fourth quarter to January.
Its shares, up Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 19 1/8 in early trading, closed
unchanged at Dollars 19, near their 12-month low.
Net losses of Dollars 1.19bn for the quarter, compared with net profits of
Dollars 535m last time.
For the year, Kmart reported net losses of Dollars 974m, against net profits
of Dollars 941m last time on sales of Dollars 34.2bn, against Dollars 31bn.
A big factor in both sets of figures was a pre-tax restructuring charge of
Dollars 1.3bn announced two months ago.
However, the company acknowledged that the main reason for the poor
financial performance in the quarter and the year was an erosion in its
gross margin to 24.9 per cent, from 26.5 per cent last year, caused by the
highly competitive conditions in the retail market.
During the year, Kmart moved to counter five previous years of stagnant
earnings by embarking on a radical restructuring.
It sold its loss-making Pace Membership Warehouse and PayLess Drug Stores
chains, announced an extensive relocation of its discount stores, embarked
on the rapid expansion of its new Super Kmart format, and prepared to sell
minority stakes in its specialty retailing operations.
The shares have responded poorly to the moves because the market is not yet
convinced that Kmart has found a formula that will restore earnings growth.
It is suffering tough competition in a saturated market, particularly from
its bigger rival Wal-Mart.
Kmart said yesterday that if continuing operations were split from
discontinued operations and all the restructuring provisions were stripped
out, it would have reported net income of Dollars 534m for the full year.
However, this would still have represented a decline from Dollars 882m the
previous year on the same basis.
In the fourth quarter, sales rose to Dollars 10.27bn from Dollars 9.44bn
excluding the discontinued operations.
Excluding the restructuring provision and other non-recurring charges, net
income from continuing operations fell to Dollars 247m from Dollars 501m, or
to 53 cents a share from Dollars 1.07.
After all charges, the net losses of Dollars 1.19bn translated into losses
of Dollars 2.61 a share, compared with earnings per share of Dollars 1.15
last time.

Iberdrola, Spain's largest private-sector electricity generator, showed an
increase of almost 12 per cent in its 1993 pre-tax profit to Pta91.1bn
(Dollars 650m).
This was in spite of Pta34.9bn in foreign exchange losses caused by the
depreciation of the peseta last year.
Extraordinary gains of Pta12.1bn included the sale of shares in Fecsa, the
Catalan utility, and other assets to the state-controlled Endesa group as
part of a reorganisation for the Spanish electricity sector.
Turnover rose 2 per cent in the year to Pta767.6bn. The company's
hydroelectric output recovered 42 per cent from the previous year but was
still below average.
Nuclear energy accounted for 57 per cent of output.
Sonae Group, Portugal's biggest private-sector conglomerate, more than
doubled net profits to Es4.9bn (Dollars 28.2m) for 1993 on turnover ahead 9
per cent at Es228bn, writes Peter Wise in Lisbon.
Sonae Distribuicao, which takes in the Modelo supermarket chain and
Continente hypermarkets, achieved a 21 per cent rise in sales to Es202bn.

European MTV subscribers

<TEXT>
A sharp rise in the number of European subscribers to Viacom's MTV music
video network was behind an 11 per cent advance in operating earnings at the
US cable television group last year.
The company, which won a Dollars 10bn takeover battle for Paramount
Communications a fortnight ago, benefited from a 25 per cent fall in its
debt service costs, to Dollars 145m, and a reduction in its effective tax
rate to 43 per cent from 55 per cent.
These factors contributed to net income for the year of Dollars 158.2m or
Dollars 1.31 a share, up from Dollars 49m or 41 cents in 1992.
By the end of the year, MTV Europe had 58.3m subscribers, up from 43m, 12
months earlier. With other parts of the MTV Networks division, including
Nickleodeon, recording only modest gains in subscriber numbers, the European
performance largely accounted for the division's 27 per cent revenue
increase, to Dollars 677.9m from Dollars 533.4m. Operating earnings reached
Dollars 239.7m, up from Dollars 172.9m
Showtime, Viacom's other network operation, recorded a 5 per cent rise in
revenues, to Dollars 543.3m, while operating earnings slid to Dollars 32.3m
from Dollars 35.2m.
Earnings fell in the cable television division, due to new regulations on
rates charged to subscribers. Revenues rose 1 per cent to Dollars 416m,
while operating earnings fell 9 per cent to Dollars 110m.
For the final three months of the year, Viacom's net income was Dollars
13.6m or 11 cents a share, after a Dollars 12.8m dividend on convertible
stock issued to Nynex and Blockbuster Entertainment, which had backed the
Paramount bid.
This compared with net income of Dollars 11.6m or 10 cents a year before.
A number of Blockbuster shareholders yesterday asked the Delaware chancery
court for an injunction blocking the merger of the video rental company with
Viacom, which was agreed in principle in January.
The action is the latest sign of concern among some Blockbuster shareholders
that their company is being sold too cheaply. Viacom's shares have fallen
sharply in recent weeks, cutting into the value of its all-share offer.
Though the company's B shares yesterday rose Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 28 7/8
, they were trading at well below the Dollars 55 a share at which
Blockbuster agreed to buy a Dollars 1.25bn stake in January.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Federated Department Stores, US owner of Bloomingdale's and several other
department store chains, yesterday reported that net income before
extraordinary items had risen by 39 per cent to Dollars 146m for the fourth
quarter to January. This was in spite of a fall in gross margins.
Federated, like other US store groups, has been forced to cut prices in the
intensely competitive retailing environment. But the group has increased
profits by selling more goods and cutting costs.
It is trying to secure profits growth for the longer term through its
attempt to gain control of the rival R H Macy department store group, in
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
Federated's fourth-quarter turnover rose by 3.8 per cent to Dollars 2.35bn,
with same-store sales rising 2.1 per cent. Helped by a gain of Dollars 24m
from the favourable settlement of disputed bankruptcy claims, the company
increased operating profits by 29 per cent to Dollars 287.6m.
Net income of Dollars 146m, compared with Dollars 105.1m or Dollars 99m
after extraordinary items. Earnings per share were Dollars 1.16 against 83
cents, or 78 cents after extraordinary items.
Full-year turnover rose by 2.1 per cent to Dollars 7.23bn while net income
before extraordinary items rose by 48 per cent to Dollars 196.8m. After
extraordinary items it rose to Dollars 193.2m from Dollars 113m.
Mr Allen Questrom, chairman and chief executive, said this year's emphasis
would be on accelerating sales growth and continued cost-cutting.

PWA, parent of Canadian Airlines International, suffered another heavy loss
for 1993. However, the airline is predicting a small loss in 1994 and a
return to profitability the following year.
PWA's consolidated net loss for 1993 was CDollars 292m (USDollars 221m) or
CDollars 6.13 a share, after charges of CDollars 112m.
Operating revenues were CDollars 2.97bn. This compared with a loss of
CDollars 543m or CDollars 11.37 a share, including CDollars 333m
restructuring charges, in 1992. Revenues were CDollars 2.88bn.
In 1993, strong international and charter revenues were partly offset by a
depressed domestic market.
PWA forecasts a small loss for 1994 and a profit of about CDollars 75m in
1995.
Mr Rhys Eyton, PWA chief executive, said: 'Once our financial restructuring
is completed in early 1994 our results will reflect even further
improvement, as expenses will benefit from reduced aircraft rental and
interest costs.'
The financial restructuring hinges on the CDollars 246m equity infusion from
American Airlines.

FT  01 MAR 94 / International Company News: Aetna hit by claims from
California earthquake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aetna, the US composite insurer, warned yesterday the southern Californian
earthquake and winter storms would cost it Dollars 120m or Dollars 1.07 a
share in the current quarter.
The company put its losses from the earthquake at Dollars 80m, making it one
of the largest losses yet announced by a US insurer.
In all, the cost to the insurance industry of the earthquake is expected to
reach Dollars 2.5bn.
The expected earthquake losses, which are after reinsurance and tax,
resulted from 2,500 claims in the affected area, the company said.
It added that it expected to receive 31,000 claims from the winter storms of
January and early February, with net losses put at Dollars 40m.
As a result of these first-quarter items, Aetna said it would drop its
earnings forecast for the year to Dollars 5.65 a share, from Dollars 6.50 a
share.

FT  01 MAR 94 / International Company News: Billiton hit by restructuring
costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Restructuring costs at Billiton, the mining and metals business within the
Royal Dutch/Shell group, sent its net loss up last year from Dollars 75m in
1992 to Dollars 142m.
Gencor of South Africa is at present negotiating to buy Billiton.
During 1993 Billiton decided to close underground mining operations at Les
Mines Selbaie in Canada and to shut its Toronto office. Several downstream
businesses in the Netherlands were sold in line with Billiton's strategy to
focus on mining and resource operations.
There was an operating loss of Dollars 17m for 1993 with first-half profits
eroded by weak metal prices.
The mining business suffered an operating loss of Dollars 14m, downstream
operations lost Dollars 6m and miscellaneous items, such as currency
exchange losses and head office costs, accounted for a Dollars 15m loss. The
marketing and trading business made a profit of Dollars 18m.
Gencor announced last May it hoped to reach agreement to buy the Billiton
assets by the end of 1993 but the negotiations proved more difficult than
expected.
Mr Brian Gilbertson, Gencor's chairman, said last week that chances of a
successful conclusion were 'better than ever' but Gencor would 'walk away
from the deal' if it was not sealed by June 30.

FT  01 MAR 94 / International Company News: PolyGram ahead 21% despite
shortage of hits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PolyGram, the recorded music company, yesterday announced net income for
1993 up 21 per cent to Fl 614m (Dollars 320m), despite a paucity of new
hits.
The company, 75 per cent owned by Philips of the Netherlands, said strong
performances in the Far East and North America compensated for a relatively
weak showing in Europe, its largest market.
European operating income rose 7 per cent to Fl 605m. North American
operating income doubled to Fl 104m and the Far East and Japan enjoyed a 22
per cent increase to Fl 197m.
Net sales were up 12 per cent to Fl 7.4bn. The total gross dividend for the
year is Fl 0.75, up 15 per cent.
Pop music sales grew by 13 per cent. Classical sales, however, were at a
similar level to 1992.
Mr Alain Levy, chief executive, said budget labels were pushing classical
music prices down. He conceded there was a danger that classical recordings
might come to be viewed as commodity items. He said PolyGram hoped to resist
the trend with classical releases from well-known artists such as Anne
Sophie Mutter and Kiri Te Kanawa.
PolyGram's film interests accounted for 9 per cent of total revenues. The
company released 13 films last year and intends to release 15 this year. Mr
Levy said PolyGram's film interests had so far produced only 'average
results' but said the company had learned more about the industry and was on
track to producing better results.
Mr Levy said he did not believe that multi-media and interactive
entertainment would take hold as quickly as some analysts and industry
insiders thought.
He said that while the technology would appear in homes, those who believed
its widespread introduction was imminent failed to take account of
consumers' desire for passive entertainment.

FT  01 MAR 94 / International Company News: Auctioneer's shadow falls over
Bull - The French computer maker's uncertain future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The man in the red jacket bid FFr3,000 (Dollars 500) for the laser barcode
machine. The woman in the blue jumper bought the chairs. Piece by piece, the
contents of Groupe Bull's computer plant in Villeneuve D'Ascq on the
outskirts of Lille in northern France were sold off to a packed auction room
of businessmen and the local public.
The closure of the Bull plant and last week's auction of its entire contents
demonstrates the struggle faced by the French state-owned computer group as
it seeks to restructure. The factory, designed to produce 550,000 computers
each year, never achieved the target and failed to break even. Bull's
mounting losses, which have exceeded FFr15bn over the past four years, and
the government's order that it must stem the flow of red ink in preparation
for privatisation, meant the plant could no longer be supported.
If the fate of the plant has now been sealed, the moment of truth is fast
approaching for the group as a whole. A recovery plan, finalised by Mr
Jean-Marie Descarpentries, chairman, is due to be presented to Brussels
within a few days. Failure of the plan, or its rejection by the European
Commission, which has frozen FFr2.5bn of state aid to the company and is
investigating a further FFr7bn injection pledged last year, could push Bull
the way of its factory.
Mr Descarpentries' recovery strategy, drawn up since he took over the group
in October, is based on several elements. The principal ingredients include
a reorganisation of the group's divisions to increase efficiency and
productivity and to enable greater responsiveness to customers, a series of
cost-cutting measures, and plans to privatise the group as quickly as
possible.
On the first count, Mr Descarpentries has split the group's operations into
separate profit centres. Reporting procedures have been tightened and
simplified and accountability has been increased. The performance of each of
the group's six product and service divisions is to be assessed at the end
of June. Those which fall short of expectations will face management
changes, according to the Bull chairman.
Costs are to be cut by the reduction of staff numbers and administrative
charges. A plan to reduce the company's headcount by 6,500 in 1993 and 1994
is to be completed by the end of June when a decision will be taken on
further job cuts. The company's 24 sites in Paris are to be combined into
just two main offices, creating annual savings of about FFr530m.
It is in the privatisation plans, however, that Mr Descarpentries is
proposing some of his boldest steps. He says the state's 76 per cent
shareholding could be reduced to below 50 per cent this year as a result of
increased shareholdings by employees and the sale of a stake of between 15
and 20 per cent of the group to an industrial partner.
Mr Descarpentries says that talks are under way with potential investors.
Candidates include NEC of Japan, which already holds 4.4 per cent of Bull
and which works with Bull on several joint projects, including the
development of mainframe business computers.
The sale of a substantial stake in the French computer group to a foreign
company would be politically sensitive, but could receive the blessing of Mr
Gerard Longuet, the industry minister, who has set a target of two years for
Bull to move to the private sector. A deepening of the alliance between
Packard Bell of the US and Bull's Zenith Data Systems personal computer
operation is also a possibility.
Partners will only be enticed, however, if there is some prospect of a
return on their investment. Bull's record of failed recovery plans, the
severity of competition in the international PC market and the scale of the
changes which need to be wrought at the French group, demonstrated by losses
last year of FFr3.42bn, place a heavy burden of persuasion on the Bull
chief.
He argues that it is possible to return Bull to profit during 1995 and that
this can be achieved without a fire sale of loss making businesses. 'We must
break the vicious circle of closing operations and losing sales.'
He points to some encouraging signs. January sales were up by 23 per cent,
year on year. Even ZDS, the source of much of the company's losses since it
was acquired in 1989, is experiencing an improvement in trading results, the
company says. The increased concentration on services and consultancy
activities will, according to Bull, increase its presence in higher value
added business.
If enticing industry partners will be hard, persuading Brussels to accept
Bull's recovery plan could be even more difficult. Mr Karel Van Miert, EC
competition commissioner, has indicated he will take a tough line, demanding
proof of a viable recovery plan.
If the capital increase does go through it is sure to be for the last time.
For Mr Descarpentries, therefore, the stakes could not be higher. All of his
proposals, from improving productivity to the search for industrial
partners, must fit together. Failure on any of the fronts of his battle plan
could spell disaster.

FT  01 MAR 94 / International Company News: SEC seeks to attract German
companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The chairman of the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission, the regulatory body
for the US securities industry, yesterday launched a 'bridge-building'
campaign to try to persuade more German companies to list their shares in
the US.
Mr Arthur Levitt, who will be visiting 20 leading German industrial
companies and banks during a two-day visit, told businessmen in Frankfurt
that it was a lot easier for foreign companies to obtain a listing in the US
than they might imagine.
'The provision of information to investors is the sole condition, the real
requirement, for access to our markets,' he insisted. 'All companies are
welcome, with information as their passport.'
At present, Daimler-Benz is the only German company out of 594 foreign
companies listed in the US. Germany's biggest company listed its shares in
October last year, prompting widespread criticism within German industry at
the level of concessions made to the SEC on listing requirements.
German companies have traditionally objected to the SEC's disclosure rules,
in particular the necessity to present accounts under US General Accepted
Accounting Principles (US GAAP). This objection ensured that with the
exception of Daimler all companies in Europe's largest economy are denied
direct access to the world's largest capital market.
Mr Levitt said that the SEC had worked hard to make the listing procedures
simpler for foreign companies. Acknowledging problems with the SEC's image
in the past, he vowed to 'make the SEC a positive responsive force'.
This is the first time a chairman of the SEC has visited Germany. While many
large German companies would like to tap the US equity market through a
direct listing, this would mean abandoning Germany's creditor-orientated
accounting in favour of more transparent, investor-orientated US accounting
rules.

FT  01 MAR 94 / International Company News: Saab halves deficit to SKr1.37bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Saab Automobile, the Swedish car maker 50 per cent owned by General Motors
of the US, yesterday announced its fifth successive year of losses, posting
a SKr1.37bn (Dollars 171m) loss before extraordinary items in 1993.
But the result was a 49 per cent improvement on the 1992 loss of SKr2.68bn
and included a one-off charge of SKr299m incurred during the start-up and
launch of the new Saab 900 model which went on sale last autumn.
Saab, which has talked of a possible return to profit in 1994 for some
months, said yesterday the chances of reaching break-even were good.
Sales rose to SKr16.12bn from SKr14.69bn, but this reflected the slide in
the value of the Swedish krona during 1993. The number of vehicles sold was
down sharply, also for the fifth year in succession, at 73,600, compared
with 86,800 in 1992.
Saab, jointly owned by GM and Sweden's Saab-Scania, has swallowed more than
SKr8bn in new capital from its owners and accumulated losses of more than
SKr11bn since GM bought into the company in 1989 seeking a prestige European
marque to extend its range into an up-market niche.
After a radical restructuring, during which it has almost halved it
workforce to 7,900, it is pinning its hopes for recovery on the 900 model,
coupled with improving conditions in its three main markets - Sweden, the US
and Britain.
Saab has set a tough target of selling 87,000 vehicles from its 9000 and 900
ranges this year but says this is realistic.

FT  01 MAR 94 / International Company News: SE-Banken recovers to post
profit of SKr357m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, the leading Swedish commercial bank which 12
months ago was on the brink of disaster, yesterday revealed a dramatic
recovery in underlying earnings.
SE-Banken, historically the financial pillar of the Wallenberg family
industrial dynasty, reported an operating profit of SKr357m (Dollars
44.67m), compared with a 1992 loss of SKr5.37bn caused by huge loan losses
that had forced it to seek government aid.
It withdrew the aid request last August as conditions improved and opted
instead to recapitalise through a SKr5.3bn rights issue.
The extent of the improvement became fully clear yesterday with operating
profits up 81 per cent before loan losses to SKr10.5bn, due in large part to
lower interest rates.
But the group continues to carry large lending losses, mostly related to the
property, finance and insurance sectors. Incurred loan losses and provisions
totalled SKr10.17bn, compared with SKr11.18bn.
But the total of problem loans was down more sharply, to SKr16.86bn from
SKr25.9bn, accounting for 5.7 per cent of the total loan portfolio, compared
with 7.53 per cent.
'We have passed the peak of credit losses,' said Mr Bjorn Svedberg, chief
executive.
He unequivocally declared the crisis that hit all Swedish banks in 1992 to
be over, but declined to say how long it would take to get loan loss levels
down to normal levels. The bank is again not paying a dividend.
Underlining the continued drag exerted by loan losses, Foreningsbanken,
Sweden's fifth largest bank, meanwhile reported an operating loss in 1993 of
SKr2.09bn, compared with SKr1.34bn, as loan losses grew 26 per cent to
SKr4.4bn. It said loan losses would tumble and income rise this year, but
was uncertain of a return to profit in 1994.
At SE-Banken, net interest earnings rose 49 per cent to SKr9.78bn.
Commissions, fees and foreign exchange earnings were ahead by 11 per cent at
SKr6.8bn and other income rose 87 per cent to SKr1.8bn.
SE-Banken's total capital ratio stood at 13 per cent at the year end,
compared with a low point of 8.4 per cent at the end of 1992.

except France and Italy (major outlets only) and Japan (department
stores only). Industrial production: data from national government
sources. Includes mining, manufacturing, gas, electricity and water
supply industries except Japan (mining and manufacturing only) and UK
(also includes construction industries). Unemployment rate: OECD
standardised rate which adjusts as far as possible for the different
definitions of unemployment used in official sources. Vacancy rate
indicator: relevant vacancy measure divided by total civilian
employment, expressed in index form. Derived from OECD series. US -
help-wanted advertising, Japan - new vacancies, Germany and France - all
jobs vacant, Italy - no data available, UK - unfilled vacancies.
Composite leading indicator: OECD data. Each is a combination of series,
cyclical fluctuations in which usually precede cyclical fluctuations in
general economic activity.

FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Raglan issue increases portfolio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Raglan Property Trust, the property development and investment company, is
reinvesting the bulk of the proceeds from its recent rights issue in the
Pounds 16.5m acquisition of a portfolio of retail and office properties.
Raglan announced a 2-for-1 rights issue in November, raising Pounds 19m for
'selective property investment'. The new portfolio has a broad spread of
locations, and offers an initial yield of more than 9 per cent.
The company is emerging from four years of losses.
Raglan now has a portfolio of properties with a book value of about Pounds
50m, while net debt is approximately Pounds 22m. The management said it
would be happy with a higher level of gearing.
It aims to build up its rental portfolio, providing cash to channel into its
core property development. This is a 223,000 sq ft site in Banbury, which
will be developed into a town centre shopping mall.

FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: ICS rises 10.5% to Pounds 2.62m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Industrial Control Services Group, the electronic safety systems
manufacturer, yesterday reported a 10.5 per cent increase in interim pre-tax
profits despite difficult economic conditions in its markets, particularly
the oil sector.
Profits were Pounds 2.62m (Pounds 2.37m) for the six months to November 30
on turnover up 33 per cent to Pounds 39.9m (Pounds 30.1m) reflecting strong
growth in control systems and the impact of the Brisco acquisition.
Earnings per share slipped to 2.91p (3.82p) through the dilution from the
joint venture with Elsag Bailey. However, interim dividend is being
increased to 1.5p (1.33p).
Operating profits increased 32 per cent to Pounds 3.6m (Pounds 2.73m) but
the gain was partly offset by Pounds 546,000 costs associated with ICS
ending manufacturing in Scotland under its rationalisation programme.
The control systems grew strongly with turnover more than doubled to Pounds
18.2m (Pounds 8.5m).

FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions boost Lilleshall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Contributions from new subsidiaries and reduced borrowings helped
Lilleshall, the industrial distribution and building products group,
increase profits by 25 per cent last year.
Pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 3.9m (Pounds 3.12m) in the 12 months to
December 31, thanks mainly to a combined gain of Pounds 771,000 from St
Helens Glass and Jay Fasteners, which it acquired during the year.
The acquisitions - together with a full year's contribution from Barlow
Fasteners, acquired in December 1992 - boosted operating profits by 48.2 per
cent to Pounds 4.27m (Pounds 2.88m).
Funds raised, meanwhile, by the group's Pounds 9.67m rights issue to acquire
St Helens last September, were also used to cut borrowings by Pounds 5.04m,
leaving year-end gearing at 3.2 per cent.
The Newbury-based group said yesterday it had taken advantage of low gearing
and cash reserves of Pounds 3.55m (Pounds 1.74m) to acquire Trutite
Fasteners, the UK subsidiary of Koninklijke KNP BT, the Dutch paper group.
Lilleshall paid Pounds 562,151 cash and repaid Pounds 1.25m of inter-company
debt with a further Pounds 300,000 payable at the end of 1994. Mr John Leek,
chairman, said the acquisition would lead to a significant expansion of
Lilleshall's industrial consumables division.
The industrial consumables division, dominated by fastener manufacturing,
was last year the only sector to report increased profits.
A rationalisation programme and significant income from Barlow Fasteners
helped the division make an Pounds 806,000 profit, compared with a Pounds
983,000 loss last time.
Although it was the smallest contributor to group operating profits, Mr Leek
said its results were encouraging compared with the 'very disappointing'
performance of building products, the company's largest division.
Profits from building products - including St Helens Glass - fell to Pounds
2.24m (Pounds 2.31m). Pressure on margins also hit the plastics and
engineering division, which saw profits decline to Pounds 1.57m (Pounds
1.68).
All the divisions, however, increased sales and group turnover rose 16 per
cent to Pounds 60.5m.
Earnings per share rose to 10p (9.2p), and the final dividend is lifted from
2.65p to 2.85p, making 4.55p.

FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: High-Point falls to Pounds 93,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits of High-Point, the specialist consultancy and project
promotion company, fell from Pounds 166,000 to Pounds 93,000 in the six
months to November 30.
The outcome was achieved on turnover down from Pounds 26.1m to Pounds 22.6m,
however, last year's figure included almost Pounds 5m from discontinued
opera-tions.
The interest charge was almost halved, from Pounds 1.03m to Pounds 589,000,
principally, the directors said, because of the lower level of borrowings.
Earnings per share emerged at 0.8p (3.1p).
UK operations were still suffering the effects of what is, hopefully, the
tail end of the recession, the company said, while the US had a
dis-appointing half year, mainly due to lack of activity in certain of its
east coast operations.
Asia and the Pacific Rim was, however, achieving expectations regarding both
growth and profitability, it added.

in the current year.
He stated that steps had been taken to rationalise the cost structure of

FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Upton &amp; Southern cuts losses to Pounds
321,000 after reorganisation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Following a period of reorganisation, Upton &amp; Southern Holdings, the
retailer which is buying the Reject Shop chain, reported reduced losses for
the 52 weeks to January 29.
The pre-tax deficit for the period amounted to Pounds 321,000, against
Pounds 636,000 for the previous 53 weeks. Turnover fell from Pounds 10.7m to
Pounds 8.67m, of which Pounds 685,000 (Pounds 2.79m) came from discontinued
operations. Losses per share were reduced from 7.03p to 0.29p.
In the latter 24 weeks of the period the company swung back into the black
with a profit before tax of Pounds 176,000. However, this included a Pounds
92,000 profit from the sale of the Huddersfield investment property and the
company's participation in a development in Kettering, the directors said.
Upton has changed its year end to July 31, a move made in contemplation of
the proposed acquisition for Pounds 2.5m of The Reject Shop.
Agreement had been reached on the purchase which, for management accounting
purposes, would be operated as a separate cost centre from the group's
retail business, said Mr James Hodkinson, Upton's chairman.
The benefits from the acquisition would begin to be seen in the new
accounting year commencing August 1, he added.

FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 30.8m housing buy for Taylor Woodrow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Taylor Woodrow construction and property group is paying Pounds 30.8m to
acquire the housebuilding assets of debt-laden Heron International, the
property and trading company formerly controlled by Mr Gerald Ronson.
The deal is the latest in a series of land purchases by UK housebuilders,
anxious to increase output to take advantage of the recovery in the UK
housing market.
Heron last year concluded a Pounds 1.4bn refinancing, swapping some of its
debt for equity.
It has been raising cash from disposals to meet its revised repayment
obligations.
Heron Corporation, the group's trading arm, has already made early repayment
of Pounds 150m which had been due at the end of next month.
The parent company, however, needs to repay a further Pounds 32.9m, also by
the end of next month.
The former Heron land and homes is in southern and south west England and
Cardiff.
The Heron housebuilding assets include about 1,100 housing sites and almost
200 homes in various stages of completion.
The purchase will allow Taylor Woodrow to increase its UK housebuilding.
Taylor Woodrow is a southern-based builder which has recently expanded its
operations to Yorkshire and Humberside. It has also been restructuring its
Scottish operations. The company is thought to have sold approaching 1,000
homes last year and is looking to increase output further in the medium
term.
Its recent land purchases are thought to have been averaging between Pounds
15,000 and Pounds 16,000 per plot.
The land acquired from Heron is thought to have cost slightly more per plot,
so the purchase should also help Taylor Woodrow meet its aim of building
larger, more expensive, higher margin homes. The average price of a Heron
home is about Pounds 85,000 compared with about Pounds 77,000 for a Taylor
Woodrow home.
Mr Gerald Ronson remained as chief executive of Heron following the
refinancing but was replaced as chairman by Lord Boardman, former chairman
of NatWest Bank.

FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Canadian Pizza just ahead of forecast with
Pounds 3.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Canadian Pizza, the recently-floated pizza and pizza crust maker, announced
pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.2m for 1993, marginally ahead of its prospectus
forecast.
Sales were constrained during the second half as the Salford manufacturing
plant reached full capacity, but a Pounds 1.2m upgrade has now been
completed, adding 20 per cent capacity.
Turnover increased by 17.6 per cent to Pounds 17.9m during 1993, and
operating profit margins were maintained, in spite of continued pricing
pressure in its main business, the sale of pizza crusts to retailers.
Retail sales grew by 20 per cent, accounting for 54 per cent of turnover and
38 per cent of profits. The other significant area of growth was export
sales, which grew by 9 per cent to Pounds 4.7m, primarily on sales to
continental Europe.
The company is looking at sites for a manufacturing operation in continental
Europe. This is likely to be built in France, involving a maximum investment
of Pounds 10m. Construction should start in 1995. It is also looking to
expand sales to the Pacific Rim.
The company raised Pounds 15m from its November flotation in November, which
paid off senior debt and preference shares, leaving the company ungeared. It
said it would not call on shareholders to fund any expansion plans.
Earnings per share amounted to 12.9p, and a final dividend of 3.6p is
proposed, in line with its prospectus forecast.

FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Losses deepen at Midland &amp; Scottish
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Midland &amp; Scottish Resources, which is in the process of running down
production at the Emerald oilfield east of Shetland, yesterday reported a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 18.4m for the six months to end-June last year.
The group blamed the loss on an exceptional charge of Pounds 17m,
representing the write-off of capital expenditure incurred in drilling
additional wells in the field, which proved unsuccessful. Turnover from
continuing operations was Pounds 35.4m.
In first-half 1992 the group lost Pounds 1.9m on turnover of Pounds 1.9m.
For the 1992-93 year the group was Pounds 113.6m in the red after writing
off the entire value of the Emerald development.
In January Midland said its two subsidiaries that ran the oilfield had sent
a proposal to their creditors for a voluntary arrangement under the
Insolvency Act 1986.
Trafalgar House, owner of the Emerald Producer rig, and MSR, which owns the
floating storage unit, have halved their charter rates until creditors have
been paid 50p in the pound.
The field's life now hangs on when the operating equipment can be
redeployed.
Midland's future depends on Spirit of Columbus, a floating production
platform being built in Italy. The group said delivery was planned for the
coming summer, and described prospects for its deployment as 'good'.
Administration expenses, including charges associated with the Italian
project, were up from Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 4.8m. Net interest payable was
Pounds 3.5m, compared with a previous Pounds 300,000.
Losses per share were 9.12p, against with 0.93p last time.

FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Healthcare Holdings talks off
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Healthcare Holdings, an owner and operator of hospitals, has invited its
bankers to appoint a receiver after talks with a third party failed to
produce an offer for it.
The company had said on January 28 that it had entered into non-binding
heads of agreement with a third party on a recommended offer. It said
yesterday that no final agreement had been reached.
The directors of Healthcare said that after lengthy discussions with all
parties the board had concluded that there was no longer any reasonable
prospect of completing a deal which would safeguard the interests of
creditors and preserve value for shareholders.
Shares in Healthcare were suspended in January at the company's request, and
publication of the results for the 18 months to June 30 1993 was delayed
pending the outcome of restructuring talks.
Mr Paul Jarrett and Mr James Hughes have resigned as directors, but will
provide assistance to the receiver.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Active buying returned to stock index futures yesterday, encouraged by a
more favourable outlook on interest rates, a firm Wall Street and a positive
mood in UK gilts, writes Joel Kibazo.
The opening trade in the March contract on the FT-SE 100 was struck at a
firm 3,282 and the contract moved steadily forward, with most of the early
demand coming from US houses such as Salomon Brothers and Goldman Sachs. US
houses were among last week's big sellers.
A firm Wall Street boosted demand in the afternoon and March reached a peak
of 3,327, before coming off the top to finish at 3,319, a 3-point discount
to cash. Volume was a reduced 12,657 lots.
In the new FT-SE Mid 250 futures contract, March closed at 3,964 on volume
of 282 contracts, against last Friday's debut turnover of 617 lots. On the
rival OMLX, a mere 29 deals were registered in the same contract as it
finished at 3,966.
In traded options, total volume came to 32,212 contracts, of which 10,644
were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 2,014 in the Euro FT-SE 100 option.
Lasmo was the most active stock option with 2,534 lots traded, followed by
Blue Circle with 1,525 and Lonrho at 1,467.

Top-of-the-range preliminary profits and a higher than expected dividend
total from HSBC Holdings drove the bank's shares sharply higher during the
morning before a rethink by analysts saw the stock drop back to close only
marginally ahead on balance.
Marketmakers acknowledged the excellent results - 'you could not really have
asked for much more, especially on the 23 per cent hike in the dividend,'
said one - but added that the market had been reluctant to push the shares
up any further.
They said international institutions had been big buyers of HSBC over the
past 18 months and would need some convincing reasons for increasing
weightings any further.
Bank specialists were also said to have been slightly disappointed with
HSBC's Hang Seng Bank results and worried by margin erosion. 'There is a
feeling that HSBC shares have outperformed enough in the short term,' said
one analyst.
HSBC touched 971p shortly after the figures were announced, but retreated
thereafter to close only 7 up on balance at 945p after turnover of 5.8m.
Switching out of HSBC and Standard Chartered - the latter fell 12 to 1215p
as fund managers fretted about margin erosion in Far Eastern markets -
helped the other UK banks make strong progress after last week's sell-off.
Barclays was chased higher, adding 17 at 558p, while Lloyds put on 14 at
603p and National Westminster Bank the equivalent of 16 at 501p ex-dividend.
TSB were aggressively bought, rising 9 to 246p, while Abbey National,
reporting this morning and where the market will focus its interest on the
dividend, gained 6 at 505p.
Life assurance stocks underperformed the market ahead of a television
programme highlighting the pension transfer story. General Accident,
reporting today, jumped 18 to 647p. Sun Alliance closed 8 higher at 357p,
with analysts tending to discount the latest speculation surrounding a
possible bid move by TransAtlantic Holdings.
A deal to merge the retailing operations of Our Price and Virgin group
helped WH Smith 'A' surge 13 to 519p. Stores analysts were supportive of the
move, which they said would bolster Our Price market share through better
management and the more aggressive use of the Virgin name. Further down the
line, there was speculation that the division would be floated off, an old
rumour but given added impetus by yesterday's move.
Kingfisher climbed 15 to 602p, aided by a buy recommendation from Lehman
Brothers. The broker believes that the quality of the group management
deserves a premium to its current market rating and also forecasts a hefty
40 per cent leap in profits at French subsidiary Darty.
Weekend press comment and Friday's management changes helped Burton gain 3
1/2 to 55 1/2 p in another day's big turnover of 30m.
Both classes of BT stock, the 'old' and the 'new' partly-paid shares, made
rapid progress as institutions searched for good value in the market. BT
'old' settled 7 higher at 434 1/2 p after turnover of 5.8m, while the 'new'
rose 8 1/2 to 316 1/2 p on 6.2m.
Racal Electronics rose 9 to 229p, albeit in rather thin turnover of 648,000
shares, as two Sunday newspapers revived the long-running story that the
company may attract a takeover bid from Cray Electronics. The latter moved
forward 3 1/2 to 193p, although volume was also low.
Vodafone shares easily outpaced the rest of the telecoms sector, climbing 20
1/2 p to 601 1/2 p in the wake of what was thought to be good US support and
in spite of short term caution being put forward by some UK broking houses.
NatWest Securities took Vodafone off its short term buy list, citing the
launch of Hutchison MicroTel's PCN product in the coming weeks as likely to
rekindle investors' fears over competition and pricing in mobile phones. But
NatWest emphasised its long term support for Vodafone shares.
Several engineering and aerospace stocks were part of a buy programme said
to have been carried out by Nomura. The list is believed to have included
Rolls-Royce, 3 firmer at 171p in high volume of 8.2m, Smiths Industries, 9
better at 488p, Glynwed International, which gained 11 at 371p, and Lex
Service, up 12 at 554p.
Tobacco and financial services group BAT Industries languished for most of
the session on fears that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may
apply drug regulations to nicotine in cigarettes. The strong market trend
and a feeling that the earlier retreat had been overdone helped the shares
recover to end a net 3 ahead at 481p.
International trading group Lonrho advanced 10 to 163 1/2 p following
Friday's court ruling in Ghana which clears the way for the flotation later
this month of Ashanti Goldfield, in which Lonrho has a 45 per cent stake.

FT  01 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Granada stock sold off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first of the expected bouts of selling of Granada shares following
Friday's successful bid for LWT was said to have come from Warburg Pincus,
the US venture capital group which had been a firm supporter of the London
broadcaster.
Dealers had initially thought that the sellers might be LWT directors, who
have a combined stake of 10 per cent in LWT and are widely expected to be
among those seeking to sell their new Granada shares. Some 112m have been
issued as part of the Pounds 760m takeover. The US group was not returning
calls yesterday.
Dealers said a number of institutions which are holders of both stocks and
are now overweight in the combined group are also likely to be restructuring
their portfolios, adding to the selling pressure.
There was some confusion over the size of the Warburg Pincus stake, with
market sources putting the number of shares at 9.4m, while the Seaq ticker
registered twice that amount being bought at 543p, with large trades going
through the other side at 548p.
Dealers said Cazenove and Hoare Govett had placed the stock, although it was
unclear as to whether all the shares had been successfully sold. Granada
fell 7 to 555p, with turnover reaching 32m.

FT  01 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Strong advance backed by trading
programmes - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Favourable developments on the global interest rate front, backed up by
strong rises in UK government securities, drove UK equities ahead yesterday
in what was almost a mirror image of last Thursday's setback. Encouraged by
buoyancy in New York, London closed at the best of the day, and trading
volume picked up after a drab start.
The stock market continued to concentrate on its own concerns, which
encompassed bond yields and interest rate prospects, and largely ignored
wider issues including the downing of four Bosnian aircraft by UN forces.
Reports from the meeting of G7 finance ministers indicated renewed pressure
to stimulate global economies.
The final reading for the opening session of the new trading account showed
the FT-SE 100 Index 46.9 ahead at 3,328.1. Share prices were in positive
form throughout the session, following a bond market encouraged first by
news that the Bundesbank had made a variable repo offer, which was
interpreted as a nod towards lower interest rates, and then by comments from
a governor of the US Federal Reserve that the board's recent modest
tightening of policy might prove sufficient to ward off inflationary
pressures.
Both moves strengthened the growing hopes in London that last week's sudden
alarm over interest rates had been wildly overdone. Traders saw some genuine
buying interest, including a strong buying programme among the engineering
and oil stocks from a leading overseas-based securities house. At least one
other trading programme appeared to cross the trading screens as the market
began to gather confidence.
The improvement spread across the range of the market, lifting the FT-SE Mid
250 Index by 40.1 to 3,960. Trading volume was slow to dev-elop until the
trading programmes made their appearance. By the close, Seaq volume totalled
705.7m shares, against 792m on Friday when retail, or customer, business
returned a money value of Pounds 1.68bn. Selling pressure was relatively
light during last week's shakeout in the stock market.
Share gains ranged through the retail and consumer sectors, which are
immediate beneficiaries from a more relaxed interest rate environment, to
the financial sectors, which had fallen so sharply during the market
setback. Notably lagging the market were the big pharmaceutical groups,
which have underperformed for several months and continue to fail to hold
the confidence of the big international investment funds that were once
strong supporters of the sector.
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking responded strongly at first to the excellent
dividend and profits news, but the shares cooled off before the close. The
banking sector showed some disappointment last week with trading results
from National Westminster Bank, raising some concern among market
strategists lest the widely anticipated improvement in corporate profits
should fail to boost the stock market.
In spite of yesterday's improvements in European bond markets, investors
remained nervous regarding the near term outlook. Some have suggested that
the UK stock market will now switch from being 'interest-rate driven to
being corporate-result driven'.
The next fortnight will bring profits statements from companies representing
around one-third of the market capitalisation of the London stock market.

FT  01 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Stable Treasury bonds give
support to stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Higher Treasury bond prices helped US stocks post gains, although blue chip
issues failed to participate in the wider market rally, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had been up 13 points at one stage,
closed a net 6.76 down at 3,832.02. The rest of the market fared better, the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gaining 1.07 at 467.14, the American SE composite 3.89
at 471.34 and the Nasdaq composite 8.72 at 792.50. New York SE volume was
267.4m shares.
Trading opened against the backdrop of disturbing news from Bosnia, where US
fighters were reported to have shot down four Bosnian aircraft which had
been violating the United Nation's no-fly zone.
Although conflict between Bosnian and US and UN forces in the former
Yugoslavia would have little direct impact on financial markets in Europe or
the US, the prospect of the US and its allies becoming involved in a
prolonged military action in the region would not be good for stock market
sentiment, which has already been rattled by rising interest rates in US and
international bond markets and by upheavals in global currency markets.
Once trading opened, however, it was clear that the market was willing to
ignore the situation in Bosnia, at least for now. Investors were reassured
by the fact that the downing of the Bosnia jets did not immediately escalate
into further conflict. The market received a further boost when US bond
prices rose steadily throughout the day, buoyed by a February Chicago
purchasing managers' report which showed delining prices in the region and a
downturn in the local employment market. By late afternoon the benchmark
30-year bond was up more than half a point, and the yield was down to 6.661
per cent.
Tobacco issues were notably weaker in heavy trading. RJR Nabisco fell
Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 6 7/8 and Philip Morris Dollars 2 to Dollars 56 as
investors reacted to reports that the Food and Drug Administration was
considering classifying nicotine as a drug because of mounting evidence that
tobacco companies have been increasing the nicotine in their products to win
or keep more customers. Philip Morris yesterday denied it was increasing the
nicotine in its brands.
Kmart held at Dollars 19 in spite of the big retailer announcing a loss of
Dollars 974m, including large restructuring charges, for the fiscal year to
end-January. The stock was steady because the bad news had been discounted.
On the American SE, the 'B' shares in Viacom forged ahead Dollars 2 1/2 to
Dollars 28 7/8 after the entertainment group reported annual net income of
Dollars 155m and a big increase in subscribers to its MTV Europe channel.
Canada
Toronto advanced in moderate trading. The TSE 300 index ended 59.6 up at
4,423.8 and rises outpaced declines by 526 to 276 after volume of 53.3m
shares valued at CDollars 664.4m. All 14 stock groups were higher. Golds,
real estate and communications surged 2.36, 2.35 and 2.12 per cent
respectively.

FT  01 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Bond sell-off provides cue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sell-off in bond markets by panicking hedge funds last week determined
the performance of global equity markets.
Most European centres finished the week lower, with the sharpest falls seen
in Italy, Ireland, Germany and the Netherlands. Hong Kong also continued its
bumpy ride, although a strong performance by the heavily weighted Japanese
market left the FT-Actuaries World index little changed on the week.
The consensus among most economists yesterday, even before the Bundesbank
offered variable rate repos, which hold out the prospect of lower money
market rates, was that the shake-out in bond markets was likely to prove
temporary and that European interest rates would resume their downward
momentum in the not too distant future.
Mr Marcus Grubb at Salomon Brothers is among those remaining optimistic
about the outlook for European shares. But he notes that the latest change
of mood is likely to continue until the downtrend in the US bond market
stabilises or European bond and stock markets decouple from the trend in US
markets.
'Further substantial declines in European short-term interest rates, led by
the Bundesbank, will push stock markets higher later this year,' he says.
'Steepening yield curves will also boost inflows of cash into mutual funds.
If US liquidity is repatriated as a result of the rising trend in Fed funds,
domestic liquidity in Europe is likely to replace it.'
Hoare Govett sees no reason why bond yields in the US should dictate the
trend in Europe, where economic circumstances are entirely different. The
broker notes that the European economic cycle is some 18 months to two years
behind that in the US; and in Europe output has barely stabilised after its
earlier sharp falls, while the US economy has been growing strongly for
around two years.
'In Europe inflationary pressures are still abating, while in the US the
first hint of an upturn in inflation is beginning to emerge. Moreover . . .
European monetary and fiscal policy settings are extremely restrictive for
the current stage of the economic cycle, while US monetary policy is lax.
This leads us to suppose the trough of the inflation cycle will be much
lower in Europe than it was in the US.'
Merrill Lynch notes that signs of a resurgence of inflation are noticeable
by their absence in Europe, and its economists believe that bond yields in
Europe can continue to fall even if yields rise further in the US. It adds
that valuations suggest that equity markets can continue to rise even if
bond yields do go up.
'Bond yields are not the only determinant of equity prices; dividend growth
also matters. To the extent that higher bond yields reflect faster economic
growth, they are likely to be accompanied by strong profits and dividend
growth.'
Merrill Lynch comments that the impact on equities is the result of a
trade-off between these two factors. 'We use the framework of the yield
ratio to examine this trade-off. We conclude that if the global economic
recovery is as strong as we expect, then we could experience rapid dividend
growth, rising bond yields and rising equity markets in Europe over the next
three years.'
NatWest Markets agrees that the bull market, particularly for equities, is
not yet over. 'Admittedly, the risks have increased, especially if the US
long bond pushed decisively above 7 per cent. But in our view, the US bond
market fears are overdone.' It says history demonstrates that after long
periods of falling rates the first rise in the Fed Funds rate does not
precipitate a bear market. The key issue for equities and bonds is the
schedule for further interest rate increases. 'We expect global stock and
bond markets to move higher in the months ahead and provide us with a better
opportunity to raise cash.'

FT  01 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): UBS falls 4% on brokers'
downgrades
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The major markets began the week generally stronger, writes Our Markets
Staff.
ZURICH was the exception, marked lower as the banking sector, which had held
up better than the broad market early on during the recent market
correction, succumbed to further domestic and foreign selling. The SMI index
shed 13.4 to 2,915.9, under pressure from derivatives trading and with a
stronger bond market unable to offer much assistance.
Bearer shares in UBS, which reported a 69 per cent rise in 1993 group net
profit on Friday, shed another SFr57 or 4 per cent to SFr1,356 as Credit
Suisse reduced its recommendation from a buy to a hold. Credit Suisse said
that UBS shares were fully valued and it suggested a short term switch into
SBC.
At the same time, Goldman Sachs was reported to have echoed the recommended
switch to SBC. Merrill Lynch cut its rating on UBS from a hold to a sell in
the immediate aftermath of the results.
Credit Suisse bearers finished SFr36, or 5.3 per cent lower, at SFr638 after
some late US selling added to earlier pressure from London investors. SBC
lost SFr15 at SFr450.
In the opposite direction, Alusuisse added 21 at SFr644 in continued
response to its positive earnings forecast last week and amid indications
that investors were beginning to switch from interest rate sensitive stocks
into cyclicals.
FRANKFURT was lifted by renewed strength in the bond and futures market,
although activity was fairly muted throughout the session. There was also a
signal from the Bundesbank, which said it would supply funds to the money
market at variable rates, that it would make a further cut in interest rates
later in the week. The market will be awaiting with interest the release of
January M3 data, also due during the week.
The Dax index rose 16.66 to 2,091.57, recovering all of the losses on Friday
and the Dax March futures contract advanced 19.00 to 2,099.00.
Daimler-Benz, which had fallen in post-bourse trading on Friday, pulled
itself forward DM4.50 to DM812.00 in spite of news that the chairman, Mr
Edzard Reuter, was likely to move to Airbus Industrie, which in turn would
spark a major reshuffle of senior posts at the industrial group.
The banking sector went against the rising trend, affected by the prospect
of lower interest rates: Commerzbank slipped DM3.50 to DM344.50 and Dresdner
Bank weakened DM3.50 to DM406.00.
AMSTERDAM regained the upward course helped by an improvement in a number of
the highly capitalised issues. Both Royal Dutch and Unilever, which had
suffered last week, found support, with respective rises of Fl 3.00 and Fl
2.20 to Fl 204.70 and Fl 215.90.
The AEX index closed up 5.11 or 1.2 per cent at 420.75.
The day's story was Polygram, up Fl 4.30 or nearly 6 per cent at Fl 77.80,
which saw a strong rise in 1993 profits, and gave an upbeat forecast for the
year ahead. Philips, the parent group, added Fl 1.30 to Fl 47.30.
Another food group to benefit from the upturn in Unilever was BolsWessanen,
rising Fl 2.10 or 5 per cent to Fl 44.10.
PARIS recovered the 2,200 level as some support for the market returned
after last week's declines. The CAC-40 rose 39.14 or 1.8 per cent to
2,238.06.
Turnover was FFr3.7bn.
Euro Disney returned to the news, and the shares advanced FFr1.60 or 5 per
cent to FFr34.80, following news that creditor banks had outlined an
agreement to provide a rescue package to the theme park operator.
Moulinex gained FFr9.60 or 7.4 per cent to FFr138.60 on a broker's upgrade,
while Assurances Generales de France slipped FFr17 to FFr628 after the
insurance group said that 1993 profits would be below those of the year
before.
MILAN edged forward, the Comit index adding 3.10 to 658.20 in thin trading.
BCI was an exception, adding L131 or 2.2 per cent to L6,060 as the public
offer for the shares was launched yesterday. The buying was attributed to
investors who fear that heavy demand for the privatisation shares, priced at
L5,400, means that allocations will be cut.
ISTANBUL lost 7.4 per cent as the Turkish lira lost more than 5 per cent
against the dollar in spite of higher central bank interest rates.
The composite index was down 1,195.92 at 15,003.58, although after a day's
low of 14,860.4.

<TEXT>
Active buying by foreign investors pushed share prices higher, and the
Nikkei average briefly recovered the 20,000 technical resistance level
before losing some of its gain on profit-taking, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average finished 193.82 up at 19,997.20 after opening at a
day's low of 19,848.58 and peaking at 20,117.21 in the morning. Foreigners
supported shares, but selling by institutional investors pushed down the
index in the afternoon.
The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 21.84 to 1,631.71, while
the Nikkei 300 put on 4.16 at 302.23. Rises outnumbered declines by 810 to
244, with 129 issues unchanged. Volume amounted to 430m shares, against
447m. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 3.74 firmer at 1,363.01.
The yen's appreciation against the dollar prompted most investors to remain
on the sidelines. The Japanese currency closed Y0.65 up at Y104.30, the
first rise to the Y104 level since February 18. Some currency traders, who
had hoped that a solution for the yen's recent surge would be discussed at
the finance ministerial meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrial
countries over the weekend, bought the yen.
Electronic stocks and large-capital steels were sought by foreign investors.
Hitachi, the day's most active issue, rose Y13 to Y950 and Toshiba Y17 to
Y773. Nippon Steel gained Y3 at Y352 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industrial Y7 at
Y707.
Multimedia related stocks continued to gain ground. Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone climbed Y24,000 to Y976,000 and NEC Y10 to Y1,050.
Arbitrage buying supported bank shares. Industrial Bank of Japan moved up
Y50 to Y3,320 and Sakura Bank Y40 to Y1,510. Brokers were also strong, with
Nomura Securities adding Y60 at Y2,380 and Nikko Securities Y70 at Y1,390.
Trading of shares in Daiei Finance, a consumer credit company belonging to
the Daiei consumer group, was suspended in the afternoon following reports
of a merger. The company said it will be merging with Riccar and Asahi
Agency Travel, two other companies in the Daiei group.
Profit-taking depressed some electrical machinery shares. Casio Computer
fell Y40 to Y1,300 and Akai Electric slipped Y10 to Y440.
In Osaka, the OSE average moved forward 194.00 to 22,138.88 in volume of
80.4m shares.
Aoyama Trading, the men's suit retailer, dropped Y190 to Y5,940 following
weekend reports that it was under investigation by the Fair Trade Commission
on alleged false advertising of its suits.
Roundup
The region's markets had mixed performances yesterday.
HONG KONG finished sharply higher on a technical rebound from last week's
heavy losses and on fresh demand ahead of results of HSBC Holdings which
were due out later yesterday.
The Hang Seng index jumped 309.98, or 3.07 per cent, to 10,410.23, off the
day's high of 10,462.63. Turnover totalled HKDollars 4.5bn, down from last
Friday's HKDollars 7.2bn.
Brokers said a technical rebound was expected after the market's plunge of
725.63 last week. After the market closed, HSBC said 1993 pre-tax profits
were Pounds 2.58bn, up from Pounds 1.71bn in 1992.
HSBC shares rose HKDollars 3 to HKDollars 114 and led the actives list. Its
Hang Seng Bank unit gained HKDollars 2 at HKDollars 69.50.
Tuesday's government land auction of three residential sites is expected to
attract strong interest, said brokers. The property sector sub-index surged
659, or 3.6 per cent, to 19,012.83.
MANILA declined steeply following the weak performance last week of
Philippine Long Distance Telephone. Brokers said the market was also weighed
down by government plans to double the stock transaction tax to 0.5 per
cent.
The composite index ended 88.52 down at 2,861.61. Turnover came to 861.6m
pesos.
PLDT fell by some Dollars 5 on Wall Street last Thursday, and the market
discounted its slight recovery on Friday. The local price for PLDT dropped
55 pesos to 2,035 pesos.
TAIWAN shed 3.1 per cent to end at its lowest level this year in very
bearish trade. Margin loan calls produced persistent selling pressure and
the prices of major banks collapsed.
The weighted index lost 175.63 at 5,414.64 in turnover of TDollars 52.9bn.
The financial sector plunged 5.3 per cent, with the Big Three banks closing
at or near the day's limit down.
BANGKOK tumbled 3.3 per cent to close the day at 1,372.93, down 46.61, on
nervousness ahead of local elections this weekend.
BOMBAY closed slightly higher ahead of the budget announcement, which came
after the close of business yesterday. However, the market moved further
ahead in a 90-minute post-budget session, the BSE 30-share index firming
51.02 to 4,287.98.
AUSTRALIA bounced back after successive falls to close higher, boosted by
steadier overseas markets and a jump in the futures sector. The All
Ordinaries index rose 31.3 to 2,180.1. Turnover amounted to ADollars 367.6m.
News Corp led the way, gaining 31 cents at ADollars 10.06 with 2.4m shares
traded.
NEW ZEALAND rose strongly, retracing some of last week's losses. The NZSE-40
capital index added 28.07 at 2,244.35 in volume of NZDollars 40m.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Markets Report: D-Mark moves higher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The German Bundesbank yest-erday sent a clear signal that interest rates are
likely to fall when it announced a variable rate for its 15-day securities
repurchase tender, writes Philip Gawith.
The repo is the main instrument by which the Bundesbank sets money market
rates, and a variable rate - more responsive to market forces than if the
Bundesbank sets the rate itself - should herald an easing of monetary
policy.
Yesterday's move came amid indications that last week's turmoil in financial
markets, and pressure on the dollar from a stronger yen, have combined to
lend strength to the D-Mark.
The German currency closed in London yesterday at DM1.7069 against the
dollar, a pfennig stronger than its low for the day of DM1.7167. It was also
higher in Europe, ending at L988.2 against the Italian lira from Friday's
L984.3 close.
The prices of UK and German interest rate futures also recovered yesterday,
indicating a return to fundamentals in markets' assessment of the outlook
for interest rates.
The dollar gained initial support from the German repo announcement, and the
downing of four Serbian aircraft by Nato. Renewed fears, however, of a
stronger yen after the weekend's G7 summit kept the US currency under
pressure and it was trading lower in New York, where it finished at DM1.7041
and against the yen at Y104.58.
Although the Bundesbank's move to a variable rate repo was not unexpected,
it was still welcomed as confirmation that German interest rates are likely
to fall further. It is the first time that the Bundesbank has set a variable
rate tender since mid-November. The repo rate has been held at 6 per cent
since early December.
It may, in the short term, prove to be of mostly symbolic significance. For
technical reasons - the allocation of funds in this week's repo coincides
with the introduction of new minimum reserve requirements for banks - the
repo rate is unlikely to fall much.
Easing reserve requirements will put liquidity into the market. The
Bundesbank will want to drain this liquidity without putting upward pressure
on short-term rates which are already high. German call money is trading at
about 6.7 per cent, up from 6 per cent before the Bundesbank eased policy on
February 17.
Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan (Europe),
described the move to a variable rate as 'highly significant'. He said the
early resumption of European rate cuts, which the Bundesbank move appears to
encourage, provided the signal to stop the liquidity withdrawal which has
hit world bond and equity markets recently, and also spilled over into
currencies.
Not all observers were as sanguine. Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global
currency research at UBS, said the variable repo would help, but markets
remained 'incredibly nervous'. He said that, although UBS's three-month
prognosis for the dollar remained positive, the short-term outlook was 'very
depressed'.
Mr Chertkow placed the blame for the current uncertainty squarely with the
US government. 'The Clinton administration is playing with fire and it could
very easily get out of control.' He said a financial meltdown similar to
October 1987 was possible.
The UBS analyst said the only means of averting this scenario, and arresting
a possible dollar rout against the yen, was a 'policy catalyst'.
'The policy (of talking up the yen) emanated from the Clinton
administration, and the Clinton administration, through the Fed, must now
act,' added Mr Chertkow.
Just as the Federal Reserve intervened to support the dollar last August
when it fell to Y100.3, so it should do so again, 'actively and publicly'.
Putting downward pressure on the dollar was the absence of any clear
statement from the weekend G7 meeting of agreement between Japan and the US
about their trade differences. The Bank of Japan is trying to counter the
strength of the yen, with some traders estimating that the BOJ has been
buying dollars to the tune of Dollars 500m to Dollars 1bn a day.
With the BOJ not apparently enjoying much support in its efforts, there is
little confidence that it can resist the trend. Most observers agree that
the rate is the function of political events, although some argue that
fundamental flows into yen - the current account surplus not being fully
offset by capital outflows - could be the dominant force.
Sterling had a fairly quiet day. Although the trade dispute with Malaysia is
a negative factor, the currency is being underpinned by the prospect of
lower interest rates in continental Europe. It finished slightly lower
against the dollar, at Dollars 1.4861 from Dollars 1.4904 on Friday.
Compared to the D-Mark, it declined to DM2.5366 from DM2.5418.
The Bank of England yesterday provided UK money markets with Pounds 325m of
late assistance after revising its forecast of the liquidity shortage to
Pounds 1.45bn. Earlier it had provided the market with Pounds 1.136bn of
assistance at the established rate of 5 5/32 per cent.

FT  01 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Copper rallies after early fall -
Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COPPER prices recovered early losses at the London Metal Exchange yesterday
while the ALUMINIUM market remained nervous as the second round of
inter-government talks on the industry got under way in Ottawa.
The three months copper price drifted down to Dollars 1,880 a tonne in the
morning, but support at that level held once more and the price bounced to
Dollars 1,982 before closing the after hours 'kerb' session at Dollars
1,888, up Dollars 8 on the day. Dealers thought, however, that another test
of underlying support was likely soon unless further headway was made on the
upside.
Aluminium prices were depressed initially by an indication by Comalco of
Australia of reluctance to cut output at its 'efficient' Boyne Island and
Piwai point smelters. But later news that Alba of Bahrain was discussing
possible output cuts with other Middle Eastern producers, a change of tack
from its previous position, gave prices a lift. The three months price,
which had dipped to Dollars 1,305 a tonne at one point, ended the kerb
session at Dollars 1,309, down Dollars 7.50 from Friday.
The ZINC market was hit by Japan's trade and industry ministry showing
domestic stocks sharply up in January and the European Zinc Institute
releasing similar data for world smelters' stocks. Traders said this once
again underlined the problem facing the world's zinc industry and the three
months price fell to Dollars 969 a tonne, down Dollars 7. Dealers noted that
zinc trading was subdued, with many participants attending an industry
conference in the US
At the London Commodity Exchange COFFEE and COCOA futures extended morning
retreats, last week's failure to break through key resistance causing the
two markets to slide towards technical support, traders said.
By the close May delivery coffee, further depressed by a weak opening in New
York, had fallen Dollars 23 on the day to Dollars 1,212 a tonne.
Traders said there was little fresh news to help the market out of the
current doldrums and some predicted a test of support at Dollars 1,200 or
even the chart gap between Dollars 1,185 and Dollars 1,190 later this week.
Cocoa fared little better, the May position ending Pounds 16 down at Pounds
910 a tonne.
Dealers said, however, that there had been pockets of trade buying around
and they expected the slide to run out of steam before May reached the
psychologically-important Pounds 900-mark. 'The market has stalled under a
bit of switching pressure but I don't think we're into a reversal yet,' one
said.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway desperate to head off
slide in oil output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Norway's Labour government is proposing a comprehensive overhaul of energy
policy in a desperate attempt to stimulate petroleum activities and stem a
steep decline in crude oil production after 1996.
The country is western Europe's biggest oil producer with daily output of
2.4m barrels, and is the fourth biggest crude oil exporter in the world.
Oil companies argue the best way to boost activities is to ease the
stringent tax regime. But in a White Paper presented last Friday to the
Storting, Norway's parliament, the controversial tax issue went unmentioned.
In the White Paper, the government recommended that exploration acreage be
expanded by 16 per cent and rules for exploring in the Barents Sea be
reformed to make it more attractive. It also intends to speed up the process
for approving oil discoveries. A number of proposals were made to streamline
licensing rules and management of the state's oil and gas resources.
Environmentalists and fisherman fiercely oppose the move to expand
exploration to the Skagerrak, about 50km off the southern coast of Norway,
and to new areas of the Norwegian Sea, off the coast of mid-Norway. Under
the proposals, in the Skagerrak, just four exploration wells will be allowed
to be drilled; only one rig will be allowed to work in the area at a time;
and, drilling during the summer - peak harvest season for prawns - has been
ruled out.
In the Norwegian Sea, six wells will be allowed in the Nordland VI area
during a limited period of the year with just one rig operating at a time.
In the Barents Sea, where 52 wells have so far failed to yield any
commercial discoveries, changes to licensing conditions have been proposed
to cut the cost of exploring there.
Norway has little choice but to stimulate oil activity; not only will output
decline dramatically in two years time, from a peak of 2.6m barrels a day,
but the country is also faced with stiffer competition for oil company
investment.
Last year Norway boosted recoverable petroleum reserves by 259m tonnes of
oil equivalent to 5.89bn tonnes, but the increase was due to adjustments to
reserves of producing fields and discoveries not yet developed, rather than
to exploration success. Out of a total of 18 wildcat exploration wells
drilled in 1993, just three small discoveries were made, yielding only 9m
tonnes. . . an 'unsatisfactory result', says the Norwegian Petroleum
Directorate, the industry watchdog, and far less than in the previous two
years.
Investment in the petroleum sector is forecast to fall dramatically in two
years from about NKr60bn (Pounds 5.4bn) in 1993 unless new oil fields are
discovered.
The size of new discoveries is expected to diminish to an average 20m tonnes
of oil equivalent, compared with 90m tonnes for fields now producing 40m
tonnes for those now being developed.
Blocks located within the new acreage are to be offered for licence
application by the beginning of next year, with award by the start of 1996.
This timetable, says the government, could enable development to commence by
2005 with first production in 2010.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Argentine
farmers find stability hard to live with - Hyper-inflation had offered
opportunities for easy profits that have now disappeared
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eduardo Zavalia, a big man in his mid fifties, looks every inch a farmer.
Indeed he owns 1,200 hectares of land, which produces maize and barley as
well as providing the grazing for a herd of dairy cows with an annual yield
of about 2m litres and most of the feed for a herd of pigs.
But these days be spends much of his time 220km away from the farm in an
ornate office overlooking a pedestrianised shopping street in Buenos Aires.
For Mr Zavalia is the president of Sociedad Rural Argentina, the biggest of
the country's four farmers' trade unions, and in these troubled times for
his members this is a full time job.
One of his sons manages the farm and another, an economist, is his assistant
in Buenos Aires.
Ironically the problems being experienced by Argentine farmers result
directly from the success their government is having in tackling the
country's previous economic crisis. Only a few years ago Argentina had
hyper-inflation running at 500 to 600 per cent a year.
Several pampas farmers had told days before my meeting with Mr Zavalia that
they had learned to live, and even to prosper, in that economic environment.
All they had to do was to avoid selling any of the maize, soyabeans or beef
cattle from their fertile farms until they needed money and could maximise
the value on the day. By combining that with delaying paying their bills for
a month or too they could make a lot of money. Some also managed to pay
their bills in depreciating peso's while selling their produce for stable US
dollars, some of which they promptly placed off-shore.
But such volatility is not conducive to confidence in the long term future
of an industry and there was little investment in new technology during
those years. In consequence the machinery on most farms is old and
unreliable and even now, though the countrys' currency has been stable since
it was pegged to the US dollar on April 1, 1991 there is insufficient
capital available to replace worn out equipment.
In advance of the currency measures, President Menem's Peronist
administration had increased wages and provided modest pensions for all,
thereby increasing farm production costs. Meanwhile the value of farm
commodities on world markets had fallen, reducing income from exports; a
combination of factors that has left many farmers in real financial
difficulties.
Mr Zavalia points out that agriculture accounts for between two thirds and
three quarters of Argentina's export earnings and claims it should,
therefore escape some of the strict monetary policies imposed on the rest of
the economy. He does not accept that any economic policy should be imposed
indiscriminately across all industries and says he has asked the government
to give aid to farmers to enable them to bring-their technology up to dote;
to provide advice to help them adjust to the new circumstances; and to bring
down interest rates on their borrowings, at present between 16 and 24 per
cent.
Predictably, Mr Felipe Sola, Argentina's secretary of agriculture does not
agree. 'Dr Zavalia is not an economist, he is a trade unionist,' he says.
And although the agriculture secretary accepts that some sectors of
Argentina's agriculture are in trouble and that many thousands of small
farmers will go out of business, he argues: 'Now fixed exchange rates are a
certainty' most of the solutions are in the viable farmers' own hands.
The inertia bred by 25 years of subsidised agriculture has led farmers to
look to government to solve all their problems, he adds. What farmers need
to do is to look to their own shortcomings in production, presentation and
marketing. That way they can stop imports of commodities that are already
produced somewhere across the vast tracts of Argentina and also make it
easier and more profitable to export to other countries.
In any case, he explains, if the government aids one sector it will be
forced to aid all, and that could wreck a policy that has led to growth in
national output of almost 9 per cent in each of the past two years.
Behind Mr Zavalia's attempts to achieve special concessions for his members
there is clear acceptance that the changes brought about by the Menem
administration were vitally necessary. 'What we have to do,' he says, 'is to
learn to manage change.'
I cannot not help thinking that the problems of Argentine farmers are the
potential problems of British farmers, writ large. The UK may not be a third
world country struggling to join the first world; it may not have had such a
volatile recent history. But British agriculture will shortly have to suffer
a shock similar to that in Argentina when the European Union's guaranteed
price system all but disappears. It will be faced with even stiffer
competition for domestic and export food markets and it too will need to
cure its own shortcomings to survive.
As a British farmer I would be very wrong indeed to feel superior to my
Argentine competitors. I am just more fortunate, for the time being.

to Pounds 183,000 in the six months ended October 31 1993, on turnover down
from Pounds 1.21m to Pounds 720,000.
The results reflect the effect of disposals of investment properties and the
sale of a subsidiary. Funds from these disposals have been used to reduce
borrowings and financing costs. The latter are down from Pounds 629,000 to
Pounds 446,000.
The deficit on the profit and loss account has been reduced from Pounds
1.23m to Pounds 74,000 and the directors hope to eliminate it in the near

FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Tomorrows Leisure losses deepen to Pounds
0.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE

<TEXT>
Tomorrows Leisure, the USM-quoted hotels and leisure group based in
north-east England, reported deepening pre-tax losses for the six months to
September 30 1993, up to Pounds 204,000 against Pounds 110,000 last time.
Operating profits were up at Pounds 476,000 (Pounds 284,000). However,
increased interest charges of Pounds 680,000 (Pounds 394,000), as a result
of the higher level of borrowing following the group's Pleasure Island
investment, pushed the group into loss.
Turnover was ahead at Pounds 5.02m (Pounds 4.48m).
In November 1993, Tomorrow's Leisure sold Lavender Park Golf Centre in
Berkshire and surplus farm buildings in County Durham.
It said yesterday that more disposals of non-core assets are under active
negotiation. Such disposals, to reduce the company's overdraft, and the
achievement of certain minimum levels of trading contribution to Group
profits this year, are conditions of the current support from its banker,
Barclays, to March 31.
Negotiations have begun for facilities beyond this date.
'We are taking positive action on all fronts,' said Tomorrows Leisure
chairman Mr John Sanderson. He said some progress had been made on reducing
debt, which stood at around Pounds 15m on September 30 1993.
Mr Sanderson said it was encouraging that Redworth Hall, the company's
County Durham hotel, had increased operating profits by 22 per cent and that
the sale of Lavender Park was at a value well above that reflected in the
March 31 1993 balance sheet.
There was a loss per share of 1.7p (loss 0.9p).

FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Exceptional boosts Pegasus to Pounds 6.93m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pegasus Group, supplier of accounting software for small and medium sized
companies, showed sharply improved profitability last year after a change of
management, a substantial disposal and the launch of a new flagship
accounting system.
The company, based in Kettering, Northamptonshire, reported 1993 pre-tax
profits of Pounds 6.93m, including exceptional profits from the disposal of
its business forms operations of Pounds 6.15m. Profits for the previous 17
months were Pounds 620,000, including exceptional credits of Pounds 337,000.
Earnings per share were 76.1p (7.7p) or excluding exceptionals 7.8p (2.1p).
A final dividend of 3p is proposed for a total of 5p, against 9p for the
previous 17 months.
Turnover was Pounds 7.5m (Pounds 10.3m) including Pounds 2.61m (Pounds
3.75m) from discontinued activities.
Mr Jonathan Hubbard-Ford, appointed chief executive in a boardroom coup in
December 1992, said the company was set for recovery following a poor
diversification and acquisition programme which had damaged both cash flow
and product development.
The company's business forms operations had been sold in total to Deluxe
Corporation for Pounds 8.75m in cash plus a further estimated Pounds 1.25m.
As a result year-end cash balances stood at Pounds 8.28m. Net interest
income contributed Pounds 229,000 (Pounds 297,000) to the pre-tax figure.
The company's share of the 'modular' accounting systems market was up 5
percentage points to 32 per cent by value. Losses on software products were
reduced to Pounds 319,000 (Pounds 1.04m), due to the launch of the latest
version of Pegasus' principal accounting package, Senior.
The company's future, however, depends to a large extent on its new flagship
product, Pegasus Opera.
It is thought to have taken 10 per cent of the modular market since its
launch in September last year.

FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Computer People rises to Pounds 1.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Computer People, the London-based computer recruitment service and
consultancy, last year saw a return to growth in revenues and pre-tax
profits as the recession eased in the US and UK, writes Alan Cane.
Helped by strong control of overheads, pre-tax profits were greatly improved
at Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 145,000) with earnings per share at 4.37p against
losses of 0.97p.
Revenues were up 10 per cent to Pounds 68.75m (Pounds 62.74m)
A single, final dividend of 1.5p net is being paid.
Last year there was only an interim of 0.65p.
Net borrowings are now down at Pounds 4.1m and the gearing has been reduced
from 92 per cent to 75 per cent.
Computer People operates placement and consultancy services in the UK and
consultancy services in the US.
Turnover for the UK business grew 13 per cent to Pounds 44.4m, while in the
US dollar revenues fell 12 per cent, but operating profits rose 12 per cent
to Dollars 899,000 as a result of improvement in margins and control of
overheads.
Mr Anthony Lambie, joint chief executive, said the group's strategy was to
extend the range of services it provided to customers in the US and UK
through organic growth and selective, strategic acquisitions.
There are two new non-executive directors; Mr Roger Graham, formerly
chairman of the BIS Group before its acquisition by ACT and Mr Anthony
Reeves who was chairman of Lifetime Corporation before it merged with the
Olsten Corporation.
Mr Lambie said he believed the group was now better prepared to handle
downturns in its chosen markets.

FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Call for early Butte inquiry verdict
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER and KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday came under pressure to shed light on the Serious
Fraud Office inquiry into Butte Mining, the UK-quoted company which is
seeking to sue former managers and promoters for alleged fraud.
Mr Rhodri Morgan, MP for Cardiff West, is also planning to write a letter to
the attorney general demanding an early conclusion to the investigation,
which was begun in June 1992. Mr Morgan will be seeking a guarantee that
there will be no political interference in the the inquiry.
Mr Morgan's action follows a written question in the House of Commons to the
attorney general requesting information on the investigation into Butte and
related matters. The attorney general replied that the inquiry was 'a
complex matter involving several foreign jurisdictions'. However, it was
being 'pursued rigorously', he said.
Butte is seeking damages of Dollars 975m from former advisers, executives,
and shareholders. One of the defendants in the litigation is Mr Roy Bichan,
former chairman of Butte Mining and currently deputy chairman of the Welsh
Development Agency.

FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Success in UK helps Sema increase to Pounds
24.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sema Group, the Anglo-French information systems company, yesterday
announced a 28 per cent increase in pre-tax profit from Pounds 19.5m to
Pounds 24.9m for the year ended December 31 1993.
Turnover increased by 20 per cent to Pounds 502m (Pounds 417m), the first
time the company has broached the psychologically significant Pounds 0.5bn
barrier, whileearnings per share rose 26 per cent to 16.6p (13.2p). The
dividend is raised 10 per cent to 3.1p. The share price moved up 9p to 373p.
The company has net cash of Pounds 18.2m, compared with Pounds 5.5m. The
book to bill ratio, the ratio between order intake and turnover, is now
1.11, slightly ahead of last year's 1.09.
The results include the effect of last year's Pounds 20m acquisition of the
Swedish company SKDforetagen.
Sema is a broad-based computer services company specialising in systems
integration - taking prime contract role in the construction of complex
computer systems for large customers at fixed prices - and in facilities
management and outsourcing.
The company is active principally in France where revenues grew 11.4 per
cent to Pounds 170.3 and in the UK where growth of 23.2 per cent to Pounds
212.1m was recorded. It was the company's most successful year in the UK
since CAP and Sema Metra merged in 1988. Mr Pierre Bonelli, Sema chairman,
said it was the result of strong growth in outsourcing - running customers'
data processing on their behalf.
COMMENT
Sema has yet to come close to fulfilling its 1989 strategic aim of of a
60:25:15 revenue split between systems integration, facilities management
and products. Nevertheless, its strength in its key applications areas of
energy, representing 57.6 per cent of sales, transport (43.1 per cent) and
defence (28.4 per cent) more than make up for its problems with I-Linie, the
industrial management package it is developing with IBM. It is however
spending perhaps as much as half of its Pounds 14.6m research and
development budget on the package business. Building a successful packages
business would ice a rich cake. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 33m look likely
this year giving earnings of 20.2p. The prospective p/e of 18.5 is
relatively pricey but Sema offers stability and growth in a sector notorious
for nasty surprises.
