FT  01 MAR 94 / International Company News: Reorganisation costs leave
Woodchester halved at IPounds 17m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Woodchester Investments, the Dublin-based leasing and banking group, has
reported a halving of 1993 pre-tax profits from IPounds 35.4m to IPounds
17.1m (Pounds 16.4m), after an exceptional charge of IPounds 15m to fund
restructuring.
Excluding the exceptional charge pre-tax profits showed a 9 per cent drop.
The charge is 'deemed fully adequate and of a once-off nature' and once
complete, the restructuring plan 'will lead to a significant improvement in
the long-term profitability of the group'.
Woodchester, in which Credit Lyonnais has a 47.97 per cent holding, has
grown rapidly in Ireland in recent years, through eight acquisitions, and
despite rationalisations the company says there remained 'an unacceptably
high cost base' and a number of 'unprofitable product lines'.
Its core car financing business grew by 16 per cent in the period. In the UK
the group reported a doubling of its motor finance business to Pounds 173m,
but decided to discontinue two non-core activities, a commercial mortgage
company and a trade finance subsidiary.
Reorganisation is also taking place in CLLE, the leasing subsidiary of
Credit Lyonnais, in which Woodchester has a 30 per cent stake. Middle-ticket
and small-ticket leasing is to be split into two divisions, the middle
ticket section being managed through Credit Lyonnais bank network, while the
small-ticket leasing and business equipment and vehicle finance is to be
managed separately. Woodchester is to take direct responsibility for the
small-ticket leasing business in Denmark and Portugal.
Total assets improved over the year from IPounds 1.4bn to IPounds 1.5bn with
a Tier one capital adequacy ratio of 20 per cent. The drop in interest rates
made this surplus capital earnings dilutive, the company said, and the board
regarded its prudent investment as a key priority.
Earnings per share were 8.25p (15.1p). A final dividend of 3.09p is proposed
for a total of 5.17p (4.5p).
COMMENT
Woodchester's rapid expansion and diversification into banking through its
strategic alliance with Credit Lyonnais has not gone as smoothly as
expected. The company's strong balance sheet however, together with its
decision to clean out unprofitable lines of business and tackle its cost
base, would seem to justify the increase in dividend as a means of
maintaining shareholder loyalty, albeit that Credit Lyonnais will be the
main beneficiary. Pre-tax profits of IPounds 32m in 1994 would seem to be
attainable, giving earnings of 11.9p. A prospective p/e ratio of 10.5 is
higher than Ireland's two main clearing banks, suggesting that any upturn is
already priced in to the company's shares.

FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Capita advances 24% and sees further growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Capita Group increased pre-tax profits by 24 per cent to Pounds 5.46m in the
year to December 31.
Turnover increased by 52 per cent to Pounds 50.2m, of which Pounds 2.14m
came from acquisitions.
Mr Rod Aldridge, chairman, said Capita had strengthened further its position
as a leading provider of professional support services to the public and
private sectors.
He said: 'Our current order book in all three divisions is stronger than 12
months ago and we are continuing to bid for many business opportunities . .
. I am optimistic that Capita will make further progress.'
Net cashflow from operating activities rose from Pounds 7.9m to Pounds 8.5m,
of which Pounds 4.4m was invested in acquisitions and Pounds 3.5m in capital
expenditure. The group's net cash balance dipped from Pounds 9.6m to Pounds
8.4m.
Capita said its restructuring into three divisions had been successfully
completed. Outsourcing increased operating profits by 32 per cent to Pounds
2.55m, the advisory division was up 21 per cent at Pounds 1.28m and property
services rose by 15 per cent to Pounds 1.64m.
The outsourcing division's forward projected revenues up to the end of 1998
stood at Pounds 118m, a 55 per cent increase over the corresponding period.
Mr Aldridge said the group had started 14 new local government outsourcing
contracts during the year. 'We have won two significant contracts at the
London boroughs of Westminster and Bexley worth Pounds 14.5m in aggregate,
which start in April 1994. These contracts are to provide collection
services for council tax and business rates. As a result, Capita is now
responsible for the annual collection of Pounds 1.2bn of public money. We
anticipate further contract wins by the half year.'
The group said prospects were excellent for its advisory division, which had
established a firm niche in well-paid work for central government.
Earnings per share increased by 23 per cent to 7.9p (6.4p). A final dividend
of 1.7p gives a total of 2.55p (2.1p), a rise of 21 per cent.
COMMENT
Capita has built an admired position in providing contracted services to
local government by concentrating on high-margin activities such as revenue
collection and computer services, rather than fiercely competitive cleaning
and catering contracts. The group estimates more than 800 of its type of
contract will come up over the next five years, so there remains plenty to
go for. Market testing is proceeding more slowly in central government, so
Capita's best chance there looks to be on the consultancy side. Forecast
pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.7m put the shares, up 5p to 220p, on a
prospective multiple of 24. They cannot be classed a bargain at this level,
but the premium rating looks justified both by the group's track record and
prospects.

FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Murdoch's Pearson stake slips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News Corporation's stake in Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has now
dropped below 3 per cent, which is the lowest point for more than six years.
In February 1988 Mr Rupert Murdoch held a 20.5 per cent stake in the
publishing group, but reduced the cost of the holding by issuing Pounds 147m
worth of preference shares convertible into Pearson shares. The stake has
fallen ever since.
By November 1993 it was down to 4.9 per cent, and by February 21 the Murdoch
stake had fallen to 3.35 per cent.
The Stock Exchange was notified yesterday as the News Corp interest fell
below 3 per cent mainly, Pearson believes, through the continuing process of
conversion and redemption of shares.

FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: London Forfaiting advances 19% - Shares
fall 7p as weaker current trading conditions are reported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Forfaiting Company, the specialist trade finance house, yesterday
reported profits up 19 per cent to Pounds 21.5m in the year to December 31
1993.
The shares dropped 7p to close at 226p following a warning of poorer trading
conditions so far this year compared with the same period last year.
Mr Jack Wilson, chief executive, said trading for the first few weeks of
1994 had been 'less favourable' than in 1993 but that it was too early to
make 'useful comments about the year as a whole'. He refused to say how
significant the difference was but explained that the shortfall primarily
reflected a bunching of completed deals a year earlier.
'We are very pleased with the results,' said Mr Wilson. A final dividend of
6.1p (5.5p) is recommended, making a total for the year up 10.7 per cent to
9.3p (8.4p). Earnings per share advanced to 16.15p (13.75p).
The company said that Mr Ooi Boon Aun, managing director of LFC Far East,
who is based in Hong Kong, had joined the main board. It said it had also
established London Forfaiting International, a UK subsidiary, during the
year to act as holding company for its overseas subsidiaries.
It also said it had strengthened its trading team and administrative
systems, and created a co-ordination department. 'We are in the process of
going from being a large small company to a small large company,' said Mr
Wilson.
Bank loans more than trebled from Pounds 21.6m to Pounds 71.1m during the
year, while bank interest payable jumped from Pounds 932,000 to Pounds
2.39m. Interest receivable and income from certificates of deposit dropped
from Pounds 3.45m to Pounds 1.96m.
The warning of a slower start to this year caused the City to shave its
forecasts. At best, LFC is likely to produce only a modest increase in
pre-tax profits to about Pounds 23m.

FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Share issue for NM Smaller Australian
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NM Smaller Australian Companies investment trust is planning a conversion
share issue to increase its size.
The fund was launched last December, less than three months ago, raising
Pounds 25.8m with its initial placing. By the end of January, the trust's
assets had grown by about 21 per cent to approximately Pounds 29m, and it is
now capitalised at just over Pounds 30m. Shares in the trust have traded at
a premium for most of its life.
Full details of the C share issue are not yet available, but it is likely to
take the form of a placing and open offer to existing share and warrant
holders, rather than a public offer. The placing stage is expected to be
completed by Easter, and the open offer to close by the end of April.
NM Funds Management is a subsidiary of the National Mutual Life Association
of Australasia, Australia's second largest life office. NM says the timing
of the C share issue is due to shareholder demand, and favourable economic
conditions for investment in Australia.

Applications for shares in Goldsborough Healthcare, the nursing home,

available to the public there was demand for 12.6m shares. Of these 3.4m

Shareholders of Kunick, the leisure group which sold its 50 per cent stake

Guardian Royal Exchange, the fifth largest of the UK composite insurers, is
dropping Royal Exchange from its title and will be known in future simply as
Guardian.
The group is also replacing its company logo with the image of an owl, to
create a 'new visual identity . . . part of the group's strategy to build a
more powerful corporate brand worldwide'.
The name will be introduced progressively in 1994 but the legal names of
Guardian Royal Exchange and its trading subsidiaries in more than 50
countries are not affected.
'A new name and identifier have been adopted for use internationally. This
is particularly important now as we establish new companies and reposition
existing ones,' explained Mr Sid Hopkins, chief executive.

FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Carlton threat to sell stake in Meridian
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Green, chairman of Carlton Communications, has warned Lord
Hollick of MAI, the broadcasting and financial services group, that he will
sell his 20 per cent stake in Meridian Broadcasting unless minority
shareholders get a better deal.
Mr Green, it is believed, met Lord Hollick, the MAI chief executive, last
week to discuss the issue following MAI's acquisition of Anglia Television.
Carlton acquired its stake in Meridian, the ITV company for the south of
England, through its acquisition of Central Independent Television.
Mr Green is believed to be concerned about the level of information received
by shareholders such as Carlton and SelecTV, the independent programme maker
which holds a 15 per cent stake in Meridian.
Both companies, it is understood, found out about MAI's participation in a
consortium to bid for a possible Channel 5 licence when they were sent a
press release.
Both Carlton and SelecTV also fear that Anglia, acquired by the main MAI
company, could become a subsidiary of MAI Broadcasting, itself a subsidiary
of MAI, thereby bypassing Meridian.
The minority shareholders are worried that any savings flowing from the
acquisition will not go to Meridian. MAI said it would not comment on
'anonymous gossip'.
Mr Alan McKeown, chief executive of SelecTV, producers of programmes such as
Birds of a Feather, believes the company has not received full credit for
its role in helping Meridian win its franchise.
Meanwhile Carlton is likely to buy out the two 5 per cent minority
shareholdings in Carlton Television: The Telegraph group, publishers of the
Daily Telegraph, and RCS, the Italian media group. Both would have to put up
an additional Pounds 40m each to avoid dilution of their stake in the
enlarged television business, something that is considered unlikely.

FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Airtours to sue former owners of Aspro
Travel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Airtours, the holiday group, yesterday announced it is taking legal action
against the former owners of Aspro Travel, which it bought last June for
Pounds 20.1m.
Airtours alleges it was the victim of fraudulent representation at the time
it acquired Cardiff-based Aspro and Inter European Airways, its wholly-owned
subsidiary.
Airtours said initial investigations carried out by independent accountants
estimate the value of its claim to be Pounds 9.8m. The action is against Mr
George Asprou, Mr Christopher Asprou and Mr Dimitrios Asprou, former owners
of 90 per cent of Aspro Travel.
Airtours said it is also taking action against all Aspro's former
shareholders over warranties and representations contained in the purchase
agreement.
The Asprou family members involved said yesterday they would fight Airtours'
action. They said: 'The proceedings started by Airtours, unexpectedly and
without any warning, are going to be strenuously and vigorously resisted.
Prior to the takeover, the company had a successful record of growth and
employment.'
At the time of the Aspro acquisition last year, Airtours said the purchase
would strengthen its markets in Wales, Northern Ireland and the south-west
of England. It said Aspro's programmes to the eastern Mediterranean would
complement Airtours' holidays to the western Mediterranean and the Canary
Islands.
Airtours said yesterday that Aspro and its airline had now been fully
integrated into its operations. Aspro's bookings were well ahead of the
previous year and there had been a significant reduction in its cost base.
Airtours said its accounts for the year to September 30 1993 reflected the
shortfall in profits against the level previously expected from the Aspro
acquisition. It added: 'There will therefore be no adverse effect upon the
earnings or assets of the current financial year.'

FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: House of Fraser at Pounds 34.5m - Flotation
could put minimum Pounds 450m price tag on stores group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
House of Fraser, the 56-store department store chain which is preparing for
flotation, lifted pre-tax profits by 31 per cent from Pounds 23.9m to Pounds
34.5m in the year to January 29, the pathfinder prospectus revealed
yesterday.
The result was after exceptional costs of Pounds 3.7m on property disposals
and interest charges of Pounds 6.8m. Total sales increased from Pounds 694m
to Pounds 722m, and like-for-like sales were up 8.6 per cent.
Earnings per share were 10.1p (4.2p). Before exceptionals they were 11.1p,
leading analysts to expect that the company could be valued at a minimum
Pounds 450m. The offer price will be announced on March 17.
Mr Brian McGowan, the former chief executive of Williams Holdings who was
tempted from retirement last year to become House of Fraser's chairman, said
the improvement had convinced him of the chain's potential.
'Most of my critical preconceptions proved to be wrong and ill-judged,' he
said.
He said the group, which trades under 17 different names including Dickins &amp;
Jones, Army &amp; Navy, Rackhams, and Binns, planned a Pounds 50m refurbishment
programme. It was revamping its product range, grouping its stores into
three categories depending on size.
It also planned to match the merchandise in each store more closely with
local customer profiles.
The Egyptian Fayed brothers, who bought the group for almost Pounds 600m in
1985, are selling the entire chain with the exception of its former
flagship, Harrods.
Of the 229.6m shares, a quarter are being offered to the public, subject to
clawback by institutions.
Analysts believe House of Fraser is looking at an offer price of between
180p and 220p per share, valuing the company at between Pounds 410m and
Pounds 500m, depending on market movements, and the effectiveness of the
group's marketing campaign.
On the stores sector historic multiple of about 19, the price would be 211p,
valuing the company at Pounds 484m, but many analysts expect the price to be
slightly lower, at about 200p.
Mr McGowan said net debt at the end of January was Pounds 93m, putting
gearing at 37.5 per cent.

FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Invesco increases assets in UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Invesco has purchased the UK index-matching fund management business of the
US based Bankers Trust which manages Pounds 1.2bn in assets.
The move will increase Invesco's assets under management in the UK.
The company has been losing institutional pension fund clients in recent
years reflecting mediocre performance and adverse publicity about its role
in handling pension scheme assets for the late Mr Robert Maxwell.
Invesco, which has made numerous senior management changes over the past
year, has said it wants to concentrate on building up its fund management
capacity in Europe.
Mr Norman Riddell, chief executive of Invesco's European operations, said
'This acquisition gives us access to market a product on the Continent.'
While he does not see significant interest in passive management in the UK,
Continental pension funds are much more likely to be interested because it
is a lower cost, low-risk way of gaining access to the UK stock market.
Invesco is paying up to Pounds 600,000, with up to Pounds 300,000 in further
payments depending on assets under management. A number of clients are US
pension funds who must agree to their fund manager having a change of
ownership.
BT has specialised in so-called passive management techniques in which funds
are invested to mimic the performance of an index.

FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Brent Walker loan moves proceed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Lenders to William Hill, the betting shop business owned by Brent Walker,
should be repaid today, the date their Pounds 325m loan is due.
The repayment follows the refinancing of the loan by banks to Brent Walker,
with Standard Chartered and Lloyds Bank each lending significant amounts.
Without the refinancing, Brent Walker would have had to sell or float Hill.
Bankers now admit that if Hill had been sold Brent Walker would almost
certainly have gone into receivership.
Changes to Brent Walker's Pounds 827m term loan agreement have been accepted
by lenders. Last Friday holders of the group's variable rate notes agreed to
changes in their conditions, including the payment of interest in preference
shares for a longer period.
Of the Pounds 83m of notes outstanding, votes were received from Pounds 74m,
with 99.998 per cent voting in favour. The notes were created at the time of
Brent Walker's refinancing in March 1992, when they were exchanged for
Pounds 101.9m of convertible bonds issued in autumn 1990.
Many of the bonds were held by Brent Walker banks, but some had originally
been bought by investors found by Mr George Walker, who was chairman and
chief executive of Brent Walker at the time the bonds were issued. There
were no positive abstentions from note holders, as there have been
previously, but it is understood that Lonrho and Tunis International Bank
were among those not voting.
Bankers said that last week there were fears that the William Hill lenders
might have to be asked for a few days grace before the loan was repaid, but
hitches had been sorted out in time.

FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Cantab loss doubles to Pounds 2.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cantab Pharmaceuticals, the bio-technology company quoted both in London and
on Nasdaq in the US, blamed increased research spending for a doubling of
losses.
The Cambridge-based group said pre-tax losses rose to Pounds 2.88m (Pounds
1.4m) in the 12 months to December 31.
Analysts had been expecting losses of up to Pounds 3.6m as Cantab broadened
its product portfolio, and Mr Nicholas Hart, finance director, said the
increased deficit was 'well within budget'.
Further spending on new drugs to treat ailments as wide-ranging as cervical
cancer and genital warts will be financed from cash reserves of Pounds 20.6m
(Pounds 6.85m), he added.
Those reserves were boosted last year by a Pounds 13.8m flotation in London
and a private placing in the US, which together raised Pounds 16.9m after
repayment of finance lease obligations.
Although Cantab hopes to bring some of its new drugs to market on its own,
it admitted that it would have to form collaborations with international
pharmaceutical groups to proceed with most projects.
Of those drugs, only LM-CD45 - developed in collaboration with Baxter
Healthcare, the US corporation - is close to marketable production.
Baxter has exclusive manufacturing and marketing rights for the drug,
designed to reduce rejection in kidney transplant operations.
Mr Hart said licence fees and contract development revenue from Baxter
formed the bulk of Cantab's turnover, which fell 40 per cent to Pounds 1.02m
(Pounds 1.7m).
Mr Hart warned that losses would increase in 1994 as R&amp;D spending rose
further and it began construction of a pilot-scale manufacturing facility in
Cambridge. Losses per share rose to 42p (26p).

FT  01 MAR 94 / MCI invests Dollars 1.3bn in Nextel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MCI Communications, the US telecommunications company, is to enter the
wireless communications market with the acquisition of a 17 per cent stake
in Nextel for Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 874m). MCI will jointly market digital
voice and data services with Nextel and Comcast, another Nextel shareholder.
The move is seen as MCI's response to AT&amp;T's planned acquisition of McCaw
Cellular Communications, the largest US cellular telephone company.
'MCI's investment in Nextel will accelerate the availability of advanced
wireless voice and data communications, bringing these services to customers
months or even years ahead of competing companies,' said Mr Bert Roberts,
MCI chief executive.
MCI also recently announced plans to expand its network to provide local
telephone services in addition to its established long-distance services.
The Nextel alliance will increase its involvement in local markets.
Last year British Telecom acquired a 20 per cent stake in MCI for Dollars
4.3bn in cash, funds that the US telecoms company is now using to finance
its expansion.
Nextel operates an extensive wireless radio network for dispatch of taxis
and fleet vehicles. Last year the company acquired mobile radio spectrum
rights from Motorola and announced plans to create a national network, using
new digital technology from Motorola that, in addition to dispatch services,
will provide mobile telephone, messaging and paging services.
Motorola received a 20 per cent stake in Nextel in exchange for its radio
licences. Other Nextel shareholders include Comcast, a cable televison and
cellular phone service company, which holds 17 per cent, Matsushita
Communications, which owns about 5 per cent, NTT, with 1 per cent, and
Northern Telecom.
MCI's initial purchase will consist of 22m shares of Nextel stock for about
Dollars 800m, or Dollars 36 per share. MCI will also buy 15m shares at an
average cost of Dollars 38 per share over the next three years, for a total
investment of more than Dollars 1.3bn.
MCI's investment in Nextel represents a change of strategy. The company had
previously been pursuing licences to operate a new type of wireless service
called 'personal communications service'.

FT  01 MAR 94 / HSBC advances 51% to Pounds 2.58bn: Banking group's profits
buoyed by Asia Pacific contribution - Dividend lifted 24%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A buoyant banking market in the Asia Pacific region along with big earnings
from foreign exchange and capital markets trading lifted pre-tax profits of
HSBC Holdings by 51 per cent to Pounds 2.58bn last year, from Pounds 1.74bn.
Rising income more than offset an increase in provisions for bad and
doubtful debts to Pounds 1.16bn, against Pounds 990m. There was a Pounds
160m charge against falls in the value of aircraft and other assets of its
Concord Leasing arm in the US.
HSBC, which has become the second most valuable company on the London Stock
Exchange since its acquisition of Midland Bank in 1992, lifted its final
dividend to 16.5p, raising the total payout by 24 per cent to 23.5p.
It also announced an enhanced scrip alternative to the final dividend. At
24.75p, the scrip alternative is worth 50 per cent more than the cash final.
The offer will be underwritten by NatWest Markets, with the brokers
Cazenove.
Mr John Bond, HSBC chief executive, said last year had produced 'a very
encouraging result'. The acquisition of Midland had 'exceeded our
expectations, particularly in treasury and investment banking businesses'.
However, Mr Bond warned that dealing income of Pounds 1.09bn, against Pounds
621m, was unlikely to be repeated this year. This was because the turn in
the interest rate cycle meant that treasury and capital markets 'are
unlikely to be as favourable'.
Total non-interest income rose 23 per cent to Pounds 3.58bn, compared with
Pounds 2.9bn pro forma, after restating the accounts to adjust for the
consolidation of Midland.
Dealing income included foreign exchange earnings of Pounds 377m, against
Pounds 383m. Most of a Pounds 72m increase in miscellaneous operating income
was due to higher income from the sale of life and pension products in
Midland.
Net interest income rose 13 per cent to Pounds 4.44bn, against Pounds 3.9bn.
The net interest margin on loans rose to 2.8 per cent, compared with 2.7 per
cent, helped by a release of suspended interest in Hongkong Bank.
Profits were dominated by operations in Asia, with Pounds 1.93bn, or 75 per
cent of pre-tax profits, coming from Hong Kong and Asia Pacific.
The ratio of cost to income fell to 55.2 per cent against 62.2 per cent, in
spite of a 7 per cent rise in staff costs to Pounds 2.5bn, against Pounds
2.34bn, and a 7 per cent rise in expenses to Pounds 4.4bn, against Pounds
4.2bn.
The ratio of core capital to risk-weighted assets rose to 7.9 per cent,
against 7.4 per cent. Earnings per share rose to 71.7p, compared with 48.8p,
although headline earnings per share excluding exceptional profits were
69.4p.
Post-tax return on average shareholders funds rose 20.8 per cent, against
17.3 per cent pro forma, and return on assets rose to 1.1 per cent, from 0.7
per cent. Shares closed 7p up at 945p.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Only a month to make the refinancing fly: Rescue talks
between Euro Disney and its banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After weeks of delay, Euro Disney, the stricken leisure group, has finally
started negotiations with its banks on a FFr13bn (Pounds 1.5bn) rescue
package.
The two sides have a month to reach agreement before the March 31 deadline
imposed by Walt Disney, the US entertainment group that owns 49 per cent of
Euro Disney. Without a deal, Disney threatens to withdraw its financial
support thereby forcing the closure of the EuroDisneyland theme park near
Paris.
'It looks as though we should be able to meet the deadline,' said one
banker. 'No one ever said this deal was going to be easy, but it is do-able.
No one wants to see Euro Disney go bust.'
The banks' cautious optimism follows an investigative audit by KPMG Peat
Marwick, the accountancy group, which concluded that Euro Disney could
become a going concern if its FFr20.3bn net debt was reduced. It calculated
that FFr13bn was needed to stabilise the company's finances.
The banks, led by Banque Nationale de Paris and Banque Indosuez, have
proposed that the deal should be apportioned on a 50:50 basis with Disney.
One element would be an injection of capital from a rights issue and,
possibly, a debt-for-equity swap, which could be linked to the underwriting
of the issue.
Another element would be a cut in Euro Disney's financial costs. The banks
might trim the interest rates on part of their loans in return for Disney
forgoing or reducing its entitlement to royalties and management fees.
Disney has indicated that it will take up its full share of a rights issue,
but is intransigent on the royalty front. The banks want extended
indefinitely its waiver of a management fee of 3 per cent of Euro Disney's
turnover, which would have been worth FFr145m last year. They have also
demanded a cut in its royalties of 10 per cent of admissions and 5 per cent
of food and merchandise sales, worth FFr262m last year.
The US group has privately accepted the need for a degree of compromise, not
least because it wants the banks to trim interest rates on the loans,
notably the Caisse des Depots which owns Euro Disney's FFr4.8bn 7.8 per cent
fixed rate debt.
Disney's room for manoeuvre is limited. It is anxious to avoid closing
EuroDisneyland, which would not only damage its prospects in Europe but also
drag it into a legal battle in France. It has made a provision of Dollars
175m to keep Euro Disney afloat until March 31 and has indicated that,
providing an outline agreement has been reached by then, it will continue to
support the company until the deal is completed.
Yet Disney cannot afford to pour in money indefinitely, nor does it want to
raise its stake above 49 per cent. Under US regulations, this would mean
consolidating the European company's debt on to its balance sheet. It could,
however, buy the five hotels at the theme park and bring in new investors.
Meanwhile the banks are struggling to maintain a united front. The main
threat to unity is the risk that some may succumb to the overtures of US
secondary debt specialists and sell their loans at a discount. Midland Bank
is on the verge of completing the sale of a FFr130m loan despite the
reported opposition of the Bank of England.
Another potential complication is a noisy lobby of convertible bondholders.
These investors are threatening to sue Euro Disney and its advisers.
The Disney camp claims that the distressed debt sales and the convertible
lobby are minor distractions. But as the deadline approaches the financial
prospects facing Euro Disney are as sobering as ever. Ms Rebecca
Winnington-Ingram, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, calculates that, even if
Euro Disney secures its FFr13bn refinancing, it will not move into profit
until 1998.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Midland bounces back to Pounds 844m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Midland Bank, the UK high street banking arm of HSBC Holdings, quadrupled
pre-tax profits to Pounds 844m last year, against Pounds 204m in 1992 in
spite of weak demand for loans and a decline in fees and commissions
obtained through branches.
Operating profits before provisions for bad debts rose to Pounds 1.4bn,
against Pounds 795m, thanks to strong income from treasury and capital
markets trading.
Sir Brian Pearse, who is about to retire as chief executive, said the UK
retail bank 'continues to operate under very difficult and trying
circumstances in a market that is over-supplied'.
The bad debt charge against lending in the UK fell by Pounds 118m to Pounds
447m, but this was offset by a Pounds 37m charge for loans to less developed
countries, and a Pounds 50m general provision against future corporate
failures. The worst bad debt experience was in overseas commercial banking -
mainly France and Germany - where the charge rose by Pounds 108m to Pounds
131m.
Sir Brian said that complaints in the UK fell by 40 per cent last year after
efforts to consult customers. Adjustments to charges for personal customers
had included abolishing some fees.
First Direct, Midland's telephone banking subsidiary, increased its customer
base to more than 500,000 accounts by the end of the year. However, it only
achieved a trading profit in December. Sir Brian said that First Direct had
not achieved the same level of cross-selling financial products, such as
mortgages, as in the branches.
Midland paid a dividend of Pounds 403m to HSBC from net profits of Pounds
646m. Retained profit of Pounds 243m, against Pounds 102m, boosted the ratio
of core capital to assets weighted by risk to 6.5 per cent, against 5.7 per
cent.
The bank said that its Midland Personal Financial Services arm had
undertaken about 7,000 transfers of personal pensions. It had reviewed the
cases and made a 'precautionary provision' against possible compensation.
Total assets rose to Pounds 76bn, against Pounds 71bn, in spite of a fall in
loans and advances to Pounds 38.6bn, against Pounds 42.5bn. Holdings of debt
securities surged from Pounds 5.8bn to Pounds 13bn.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Conrad Black pays Dollars 180m for Chicago daily newspaper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Hollinger, the international newspaper group controlled by Mr Conrad Black,
owner of the UK's Telegraph group, has made its first foray into the urban
US market by buying the Chicago Sun-Times, the country's ninth biggest
daily.
Hollinger will pay Dollars 180m (Pounds 121m) for the privately owned
Sun-Times Company, whose assets include about 60 community papers in the
Chicago area.
The present owners, comprising institutional investors and senior Sun-Times
managers, bought the company six years ago in a leveraged buy-out from Mr
Rupert Murdoch, the publishing magnate.
Hollinger's vehicle for the acquisition is American Publishing, a
wholly-owned subsidiary which publishes 280 small-town papers across the US.
Mr David Radler, Hollinger president, said the deal would be financed by
bank loans. However, American Publishing plans to strengthen its equity base
through a public share issue. The issue, for about Dollars 150m, is expected
to be completed by mid-year.
Mr Radler said the Sun-Times is a 'better fit and a more viable company'
than the struggling New York Daily News, which Mr Black unsuccessfully
pursued two years ago.
The Sun-Times, a tabloid, is best known for its coverage of Chicago's
political scene, and for its sports news. It has a daily circulation of
about 535,000, compared with 690,000 for its broadsheet rival, the Chicago
Tribune.
Mr James Goss, media analyst at Duff &amp; Phelps, the rating agency, estimated
that the Tribune has between 75 per cent and 80 per cent of advertising
revenue in the Chicago area. He added that 'in terms of number-two papers,
the Sun-Times is probably as well-positioned as any could be'.
Mr Radler said the Sun-Times has been profitable for the past six years.
However, the 1988 buy-out has left the present owners with a heavy
debt-service burden.
Mr Radler indicated that Hollinger will apply much the same formula of tight
cost controls and enhanced technology to the Sun-Times as it has brought to
its other acquisitions in the UK, North America, Australia and Israel.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Ulster Unionist blow to talks: Molyneaux rules out return to
multi-party discussions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN, PHILIP STEPHENS and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Attempts by the British and Irish governments to forge a durable settlement
in Northern Ireland were dealt a serious blow yesterday when the Ulster
Unionists, the province's largest political party, ruled out a return to
round-table talks with Dublin and other constitutional parties.
Mr James Molyneaux, the UUP leader, said multi-party talks under the old
formula of nothing being agreed until everything was agreed were 'a recipe
for disaster and failure.'
He said the party was prepared to continue with bilateral discussions
co-ordinated by Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister.
The party's stance was condemned by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime
minister, who said any attempt to reach an internal settlement in Northern
Ireland was 'unacceptable'.
Mr John Major also reaffirmed his support for the so-called three-stranded
approach, covering relations within the province, between the province and
Dublin, and between London and Dublin.
The prime minister, who last night held talks on Northern Ireland with US
president Bill Clinton, said Britain was anxious to draw a line under its
dispute with Washington over the visit to the US of Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn
Fein president.
Launching new UUP proposals for devolved government in Ulster, Mr Molyneaux
attacked Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, for 'to some
extent torpedoing' the Ancram talks process by sending Dublin a checklist of
ideas.
There seemed to be 'a dichotomy if not worse' within the Northern Ireland
Office, the UUP leader said. If Sir Patrick had not intervened, 'we might
have been today in possession of a single document setting out the common
ground of the four constitutional parties' in the north.
Calling for the introduction of internment as part of an immediate clampdown
on terrorism, he warned Mr Major that the UUP's special relationship with
the Conservative party would be jeopardised if the government was not
prepared to press on with restoring accountable democracy to the province.
The centrepiece of yesterday's proposals was a call for the establishment of
an 85-member Ulster assembly, elected by proportional representation.
A separate three-member panel to oversee the assembly would also be elected.
Its powers might include protecting the rights of the minority community.
On relations with Dublin, the party said it would 'develop co-operation on
matters of mutual interest and concern.'
In the US, Mr Major emphasised that last December's joint declaration was
not designed to provide a 'quick fix' in the province. It would stand to
provide the foundation for a permanent settlement.
The prime minister is thought to believe that the internal assembly sought
by Mr Molyneaux would be vetoed by Mr John Hume's mainly Catholic Social
Democratic and Labour party. This could wreck prospects for a durable
settlement.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Firmer bonds lift European share prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, CONNER MIDDELMANN and MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A further recovery in bond markets led share prices higher across Europe
yesterday. Bonds consolidated in calmer trading but traders said long-term
investors remained sidelined and cash activity was thin.
German bond markets firmed after the Bundesbank called for variable-rate
securities repurchase agreements, a move seen as paving the way for lower
short-term interest rates.
Later, encouraging comments from a member of the US Federal Reserve gave US
Treasuries a lift, further supporting European bond markets.
Prices eased on late profit-taking in the German bund market, where traders
were reluctant to hold paper ahead of the release of M3 money supply growth
numbers for January and amid tension in the Balkans and Russia.
UK gilts, however, held most of their gains, with the Liffe March long gilt
futures contract closing at 113 7/16 , up  5/8 point on the day.
In the London equity market, the FT-SE 100 Index closed at the best of the
day, a gain of 46.9 bringing it to 3,328.1. The Footsie has now recovered
all but 12 points of the ground lost last Thursday. Other European equity
markets were also firmer.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Tory vice-treasurer quits after failing to report US trading
ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A senior Conservative party fundraiser has resigned after he failed to
notify Central Office that he had been banned from cocoa trading in the US
for 10 years, Central Office announced last night.
The disclosure of the financial past of Mr Anthony Weldon, a vice-treasurer,
came as the party took the unusual step of denying reports that it had
encouraged defence manufacturers to give money in return for information.
Mr Weldon, who is head of Team 1000, a Conservative fundraising
organisation, said he had resigned to 'prevent further embarrassment' to the
party.
His departure follows detailed allegations in the Daily Mirror that he had
fallen foul of US financial rules.
Central Office said it understood that Mr Weldon regretted the charges laid
against him during his three years in the US, relating to actions which took
place between 1982 and 1984.
But since he regarded them as 'technical and not bearing on personal
integrity' he did not defend the accusations in the US court, nor did he
previously think it relevant to disclose them to the party.
In an attempt to stem further separate allegations about its finances, the
party issued a statement saying it never accepted funds in exchange for
confidential information. Central Office said it received proposals in a
document from Mr David Bryan, who runs a company specialising in police
motorcycle radios. The document, which appeared to offer high-level meetings
and valuable information to companies, was rejected as soon as it was
tendered.
The party spokesman said it 'breached policy guidelines' and was therefore
never seriously discussed. The proposals were rejected as they could have
been seen as a means of persuading companies to donate money in return for
information.
Mr Weldon was behind the scheme which organised meetings with
representatives from the defence and security industries at the party's
headquarters.

FT  01 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: House of Fraser
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Private investors, by now used to being squeezed in small flotations, will
have to get used to being squeezed in large ones if the House of Fraser
float is any guide. The Stock Exchange is allowing SG Warburg to place 75
per cent of the issue - without any clawback - leaving only around Pounds
100m-worth in an offer for sale. Yet given the flow of retail funds into the
stock market, it is hard for the exchange to argue a lack of interest. The
tilt on the playing field seems to have shifted further in the direction of
an easy life for lead managers and guaranteed allocations for institutions.
In the circumstances it is fortunate that House of Fraser is unlikely to
prove a glittering star. Its large, if not particularly saleable, property
portfolio provides a solid asset base. But its growth prospects as a
retailer are hardly electrifying. Much-needed remedial work by its new
management means that some improvement must be possible, but the company's
ability to invest in the business is constrained by its cash flow. The
company also faces a struggle to present high quality service at the same
time as cutting staff and introducing more part-timers.
Department store retailing is increasingly unfashionable and, while House of
Fraser's performance may improve, that of other retailers will improve
faster. The Fayeds have also been trying to sell the company for a long
time. That argues for a discount to the sector. Presumably such
considerations are why Warburg wants to control the float, though if it can
tickle the price up in the placing, there will be even less for retail
investors to shoot at.

FT  01 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: PolyGram
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
While other entertainment companies diversify in response to multi-media
mania, PolyGram makes a strong case for the virtues of single-mindedness.
Despite delays in releasing hit records and with recession still rippling
through its home European markets, PolyGram lifted net income by 21 per cent
in 1993. Imagine what would have happened in a good year.
Efficiency gains nudged operating margins up to 12.6 per cent. Weak European
sales were offset by a 31 per cent gain in the far east and a strong
performance in the rest of the world. After some years of disappointment,
PolyGram's US business is also coming good, benefiting from unutilised tax
losses. The acquisition of Motown will further help the cause. Sales of
classical music, which account for 12 per cent of revenues, may be
increasingly squeezed by cut-price competitors. But the company can more
easily resist the trend in pop music where teeny boppers with a craving for
the Cranberries have nowhere else to go.
PolyGram's focus grows somewhat fuzzy round the edges with its infant film
production business still losing money. It may cautiously explore other
ventures in related fields, such as video games and publishing. That
threatens to dilute short-term financial returns but may increase PolyGram's
industrial appeal as a global software factory. Few investors are likely to
sell such a prospect.

FT  01 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: UK pensions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's holding statement from the Securities and Investments Board
inspires little confidence in its clamp-down on mis-selling of personal
pensions. It can only be hoped that the vague promise of proper information
for investors and better control of salesmen heralds tough measures later
this month. Neither the proposed fact sheet for investors nor the mooted
14-day cooling-off period are likely to afford much protection unless the
sales process is bought under close control. A mandatory comparison of the
benefits under different pension schemes - and a clear written statement of
the reasons why any transfer should be made - would be good places to start.
Still, SIB is not acting alone. The new training and competence standards
promised by the Personal Investments Authority - should it ever get off the
ground - might help start the necessary revolution in the education of
salesmen. Full disclosure of commissions paid to sales agents - forced on a
reluctant industry last summer by the government - should make the sale of
pensions more transparent.
Moves to tighten methods of calculating the cash value of pension benefits
should help ensure a fair deal for consumers determined to transfer out of
occupational schemes. That thorny issue is, rightly, in the hands of the
actuarial profession. Since pension transfers are still being made despite
the evident pitfalls, though, a sense of urgency is clearly required.

FT  01 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: HSBC's good deal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Federal Reserve's decision to tighten monetary policy three weeks ago
raised two worries about HSBC Holdings. First, it was a reminder that its
customers in Hong Kong would not enjoy indefinitely such a benign
combination of low real interest rates and rapid economic growth. Indeed the
risk is that the Hong Kong authorities may be forced to raise interest rates
just as the regional economic cycle turns down. Second, the bond market
weakness unleashed by the Fed's action must have caused anxious moments for
a bank with a Pounds 26bn portfolio of debt securities and which has become
used to making large profits from playing the yield curve.
Yesterday's annual results suggest the latter may remain the bigger worry.
Provisions against lending in Hong Kong fell last year to a meagre Pounds
81m from Pounds 126m. They would certainly rise if the economy turned. But
it would take a fierce reversal of the interest rate trend for large-scale
loan losses to occur. If the rise in rates remains modest, as still seems
possible, the bank could even benefit. It would earn more on its
interest-free liabilities.
By contrast, securities markets look unlikely to maintain the buoyancy which
HSBC needs to sustain its dealing profits. At Pounds 1.1bn these are nearly
a third of group operating profit. Some Pounds 700m comes from securities
dealing rather than foreign exchange. That is more than the entire increase
in operating profit which HSBC would have reported had Midland been a
subsidiary for the whole of 1992. It is no surprise that HSBC shares have
started to under-perform the sector, especially since the Pounds 160m
aviation leasing provision shows it is still not immune from accident.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Heseltine questions legal advice on arms-to-Iraq: Lyell
defends position on immunity certificates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday publicly
questioned the legal advice given to ministers in the Matrix Churchill case.
Mr Heseltine told the Scott arms for Iraq inquiry he had been offered
contradictory advice by Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, on whether
he should sign public immunity (PII) certificates preventing disclosure of
Whitehall documents.
Last night Sir Nicholas issued a short statement saying his advice on PII
'has remained consistent'. He is planning to give evidence to the Scott
inquiry in three weeks time.
Earlier Mr Heseltine told the Scott inquiry that he had signed a PII
certificate extremely reluctantly, only after being advised by Sir Nicholas
that it was his duty to do so. He had also been reassured that his concerns
would be conveyed to the judge.
But following the collapse of the Matrix Churchill trial, Mr Heseltine
received further advice from Sir Nicholas that he was not duty-bound to sign
a PII in cases where revealing documents 'might be essential to ensure a
fair trial'.
Mr Heseltine said he found the apparent contradiction 'incredible' given his
strong reservations about not making documents available to the defence in
the Matrix Churchill case.
In the Matrix Churchill trial, counsel for the prosecution, Mr Alan Moses
QC, made no reference to Mr Heseltine's worries and argued that the
documents were not relevant to the defence.
Mr Heseltine said he was in principle in favour of the need for
confidentiality to preserve working relationships between officials and
ministers and to protect intelligence services.
But he had at first refused to sign a PII certificate in the Matrix
Churchill case after a close examination of the documents involved.
These showed links between the intelligence services and Matrix Churchill
executives, and official approval of the export of machine tools to Iraq
known to be of military use. The prosecution said the businessmen had lied
to the government, and that the documents were not relevant to the defence
even though they showed the executives exporting defence-related equipment
with full government knowledge.
Mr Heseltine said: 'It became apparent to me that if this series of events
were known at any stage, I would have to become engaged in a process of
non-communication. This I was not prepared to do.' He signed the PII
certificate only after insisting it was phrased in such a way as to protect
him from any allegation that he had been engaged in a cover-up.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said: 'It is hard to see
how the attorney-general can now survive. His role appears to have been to
protect the government rather than the course of justice.'
The inquiry was adjourned until tomorrow when evidence will be taken from Mr
Gerald Hosker, Treasury solicitor.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Indian budget goes for growth amid worries over borrowing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL and SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Manmohan Singh, the Indian finance minister, announced measures to
liberalise the economy and promote growth yesterday, improving
convertibility of the rupee and cutting interest rates, customs duties and
taxes.
But the reforms, set out in the annual budget speech, were overshadowed by
an admission that government borrowings have soared in the past year far
above targets - to levels at which they are prompting some observers to
voice fears about the country's economic stability.
Mr Singh disclosed that because of lower than expected tax and customs
revenues and higher than anticipated spending on subsidies and other items,
the fiscal deficit for the year to the end of March would be about 7.3 per
cent of gross domestic product, compared with a target of 4.7 per cent. The
target for the new year starting in April is to be 6 per cent.
The budget was widely seen as relying on increased economic activity to
bring higher government revenues and so eventually cut public borrowing. Mr
Singh admitted as much in his speech, saying the risks he was taking were
prudent.
Industrialists publicly hailed the steps taken to encourage growth, but
expressed fears about the fiscal deficit and disappointment at the lack of
bold deregulatory initiatives. The Bombay stock exchange 30-share index
closed 50.37 points up on the day at 4,287.98.
Mr Singh was presenting his fourth budget since the government took office
in 1991 and responded to a balance of payments crisis by embarking on
India's most extensive economic reforms since independence.
He expressed concern about the fiscal deficit and pledged to 'return to the
path of fiscal rectitude'. He also promised to continue with pro-market
reform and promoting trade and investment.
The rupee, already convertible for trade dealings, is also to be made freely
exchangeable on the current account. Restrictions remain on capital
transactions involving the sale and purchase of assets.
Mr Singh's other specific proposals include a cut in the maximum rate of
customs duty from 85 per cent to 65 per cent, a reduction in the maximum
rate of corporate tax including surcharges from 65 per cent to 55 per cent,
and a cut in income taxes.

persuade doubters in the City that global commercial banking makes sense?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Sitting in his office overlooking the muddy Thames, the chairman of
Britain's second most valuable company vents a characteristic flash of
irritation at the stockbrokers massed behind him in the City. 'The first
view was 'Here is this bank from Asia. They have got these huge profits, but
look at their track record in Australia, look at America. They can't manage
any bloody thing.' Well, my team and I have got to prove those detractors
wrong,' says Sir William Purves.
For most of his working life, the 62-year-old expatriate Scot did not have
to worry overmuch about City institutions. The chairman of the Hongkong and
Shanghai Bank answered only to the retail investors of Hong Kong and a
supportive board, whose non-executives traditionally came from the UK
colony's trading companies. 'Going back a few years, I don't suppose I
looked at the bank's share price more than once a month, or something,' says
Sir William, with a touch of nostalgia.
But things have changed since the Bank of England insisted that Sir William
shift his headquarters from a glamorous tower by Hong Kong harbour to an
undistinguished blue-tinted block near Tower Bridge. The Pounds 3.9bn
acquisition of Midland Bank - the fourth-largest UK clearing bank - in a
contest with Lloyds Bank 18 months ago not only transformed Hongkong and
Shanghai into a global banking group called HSBC Holdings, but exposed it to
unaccustomed scrutiny.
After a series of flawed attempts to diversify its retail banking activities
around the world in the 1980s, the boom in its south-east Asia base combined
with the Midland acquisition has given Sir William a chance to lay the
doubts to rest before he retires. To do so, he must not only show that
HSBC's core of 400 senior managers can run banks around the world
competently, but demonstrate, against conventional wisdom, that the concept
of a global commercial bank makes sense.
The 51 per cent rise in HSBC's pre-tax profits for 1993 to Pounds 2.6bn,
announced yesterday, is a stage in this process. Sir William is expected to
retire in 1995, although it could be later, and has set himself a single
task before he goes. 'I would like to see the jury not being out, I would
like to see some credibility,' he says. 'It is not going to be easy because
the years ahead may not be so easy for banks. But I would like to see some
of the question marks about HSBC Holdings lifted.'
The initial doubts he had to dispel were among Midland shareholders, who not
only had more instinctive respect for the management record of Mr Brian
Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds Bank, but were not eager to swap their
Midland stakes for HSBC paper. 'The people running the UK funds said: 'If
I'd wanted a stake in a global bank, I would have bought it',' says Mr
George Cardona, HSBC's head of planning.
Those shareholders are convinced - for the moment. HSBC has gained from the
hunger for emerging markets since the acquisition of Midland on July 10
1992. HSBC's shares have risen from 477p each to yesterday's close of 945p.
But the difficult part is still to come. The group must make the other parts
of its business work, by redressing the imbalance of holding 40 per cent of
its assets in south-east Asia, while deriving Pounds 1.9bn - or 75 per cent
 -of pre-tax profits from the region.
Although the largest investment banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan
Stanley have developed operations around the world to channel cross-border
flows of capital, there are few contenders to become global commercial
banks. After the losses sustained in the 1980s by banks which tried to
expand overseas by lending to big companies at narrow margins, or buying
small retail banks in other countries, most banks have accepted that they
are more successful sticking to the home markets in which they are strong.
The exceptions are European banks such Deutsche Bank and Credit Lyonnais,
which still have ambitions to build cross-border retail franchises, and
Citicorp, the US bank which has a strong retail business in many emerging
markets such as Latin America. But HSBC has managed its portfolio of banks
differently. Instead of forming a single bank, it has allowed the
managements of banks such as Marine Midland in New York and Hongkong Bank of
Canada to run them independently.
HSBC's attempts to expand internationally go back a long way. It always had
an international outlook, because it was formed to finance trade out of the
south-east Asia in 1865. But Sir William dates the decision to do more than
establish overseas offices from the 1970s. 'We believed that if we just sat
as a strong regional bank, we would be swallowed up by a Japanese or an
American bank. We thought there was an opportunity for a Hong Kong bank to
expand into a big fellow,' he says.
By the late 1980s, its method of doing so looked disastrously ineffective.
HSBC's directors were particularly chastened by Marine Midland, which they
fully acquired in 1987. It sustained losses of Dollars 720m between 1987 and
1991 after its US managers tried to turn it from a regional bank in New York
state into a rival to Chase Manhattan and Citicorp. Sir William watched from
the sidelines, because HSBC had agreed to allow Marine Midland autonomy as
the price for acquiring a US bank.
It was a frustrating period for a naturally impatient man, made worse by the
fact that HSBC's small Australian subsidiary was also losing money. US
regulators and HSBC eventually decided enough was enough, and a team of HSBC
directors took over. Marine Midland returned to its regional bank role and
recovered to a Dollars 173.2m pre-tax profit last year. The team included Mr
Keith Whitson, who is taking over from Sir Brian Pearse as chief executive
of Midland Bank from next month.
Mr Whitson says HSBC learnt a lesson from Marine Midland. 'Clearly, with the
benefit of hindsight, we kept our hands far too much off the tiller. We did
not manage to get the management there to become part of the group. They
paid lip service to it, but they did not do it,' he says. HSBC does not
intend to make a similar mistake with Midland. It has already merged HSBC's
and Midland's treasury operations, and is working on plans to improve
Midland's technology.
The most obvious symbol of the group's determination not to delay in getting
to grips with Midland is the retirement of Sir Brian, a well-respected
banker brought in by the Bank of England to rescue Midland at the height of
its bad debt and management problems in 1991. Sir Brian was thought by some
to be a candidate as Midland chairman. Although HSBC directors talk of Sir
Brian's achievements admiringly, Sir William is taking on the Midland
chairmanship himself.
Strengthening Midland, and returning it to something closer to its glory
days in the 1950s as the largest UK bank, is crucial to Sir William's task
of proving that HSBC can manage businesses well. He believes there is room
for improvement.
'British high-street banking has developed more slowly than in other places.
In many countries in Asia, I think that the customer has a much better
service,' he says. HSBC directors believe that both technology and staff
training need to be improved.
Apart from improving service to personal customers, HSBC is trying to
rebuild Midland's lost market share in lending money to, and handling cash
for, small companies. Other banks say that Midland has emerged as the
high-street bank most willing to lend money to small businesses since it
acquired HSBC's backing.
'We want that image, as long as we do not get the reputation for throwing
money at people without assessing the risks properly. We are looking for
business,' says Mr Whitson.
Attracting more business from large companies has, initially at least, not
been too difficult. The HSBC takeover has given Midland the backing of a
parent company with a lot of capital, which makes big companies feel safer.
HSBC's influence makes it a more natural choice for European companies
trading in south-east Asia. 'We have gained quite a lot of corporate
business from across the Channel which would never have come to Midland
previously,' says Sir William.
But HSBC has a long way to go before it rivals US banks like J P Morgan in
providing a range of financial services, including the underwriting and
distribution of securities for big companies as well as lending to them.
This would require it to integrate commercial banking better with global
investment banking. Investment banking activities made a pre-tax profit of
Pounds 253m last year, and remain a poor cousin of the group's main banking
business.
HSBC saw the logic of shifting its balance of business towards investment
banking in the 1980s when it acquired James Capel, the London-based equity
broker, to add to its Wardley merchant banking arm in Asia. But before it
took over Midland - and with it Samuel Montagu, the merchant bank - the
investment banking businesses operated separately from each other and from
the commercial banking side, and were ineffective. 'We had a rather motley
crew all doing different things, and not co-operating very much,' says Sir
William.
HSBC has now set its sights on creating a global investment bank under the
direction of Mr Bernard Asher. He says HSBC has got the size and range of
activities that attract large companies to deal with its treasury and
capital markets arms. 'We started in a colonial cul-de-sac, and you do not
get many large multinationals there. Once you become large and generate
activity, multinational companies feel they have to deal with you,' he says.
Yet HSBC has so far shied away from carrying out the full merger of its
corporate advisory and equity underwriting arms with its broking and trading
activities to create an integrated investment bank. This is a tacit
acknowledgement of the weakness of its merchant banking operations.
Integration would stop James Capel from offering broking services to other
banks, and Samuel Montagu could not supply enough business to compensate.
The move to London has thus presented Sir William and HSBC with twin
challenges in creating both an improved form of British clearing bank, and a
global investment bank. Sir William says this was the reason HSBC's board
decided he should remain at the helm after the official retirement age of
60.
'I said to the board: 'I think it is an opportunity for me to retire. I
would normally be retiring if this move was not taking place.' I am afraid I
did not get too much encouragement,' he says.
But beyond the concrete task of forging new businesses lies the less
tangible one of showing that HSBC's management can add value to a diverse
set of businesses. It is not just the past that provokes doubt, but the
impression that Sir William himself is so dominating a figure that the bank
depends too much on his presence. Although he dislikes such talk, at times
he appears almost single-handedly to have dragged HSBC into being as a
global force.
Critics say that, despite an enormous appetite for work and a formidable
grasp of detail, he can be too impatient. They also question whether his
gruff exterior and imposing presence have discouraged the emergence of a
successor. Until the Bank of England insisted that the jobs were separated,
Sir William was both chairman and chief executive of HSBC and, even now, it
is difficult to imagine him giving free rein to Mr John Bond, the chief
executive.
As the winter sunshine streams in, Sir William reflects on his reputation
for ferocity. 'I lead a meeting, some would say I dominate a meeting, but
let me tell you that, if there is someone in my team who does not agree with
what I am saying, I hope I listen to them. I believe I listen to them.' He
pauses a few seconds. 'I don't like a long story. It doesn't impress me
having to listen to 15 minutes, and I sometimes say: 'Where's the real meat
here?' '
Some colleagues maintain that Sir William has tried to promote a new
generation of managers. It did not always work, as he acknowledges. 'There
was a 10-year period when for one reason or another we did not seem able to
get sufficiently good people, but we have got some excellent young people
coming up,' he says. He insists that he will not delay his departure too
long. 'There is no way that one man can run a group like this.
'Who knows when it will be time for me to go? Sometime soon, sometime soon I
expect. I don't see why I should go on working forever. I believe that, when
the moment comes, it will be clear to me, but human beings sometimes don't
see it. If I don't, one of my team will say to me: 'Willie, time to go.' And
I'll be off.'

Among gardens dropped from the new edition are a sprinkling belonging to
Lloyd's Names, battered by their recent losses. Compilers Graham Rose and

the mid-1990s may be the years of the Names, forced to reduce expenditure on

John Major's trip to Washington and the rumpus over the Thatcher Collection
raises the question of the ownership of gifts received by national leaders
during their time in office.
Harry Truman took a characteristically simple view. Introducing his 1973
biographer Merle Miller to the part of the Truman Library, in his native
Independence, Missouri, that was devoted to such gifts, he observed: 'They
were given to the president of the United States, which is what, for a time,
I was, but I never thought they were for my personal use.'
But there was one exception: a jewelled sword, from King Saud of Saudi
Arabia. Truman explained: 'I told Bess (his wife) I'd give that to her if
she'd kick Bricker (a Republican senator from Ohio) in the ass, but she
wouldn't do it. So it's still here.'

It's an ill snow-blizzard which blows nobody any good. Despite the Arctic
conditions in the US, at least one industry is thriving. Kitty litter has
become such a hot commodity that even America's non-cat lovers can no longer
do without it.
People are buying the stuff to spread over slippery sidewalks; apparently
it's an environmentally friendly alternative to the more traditional rock
salt, itself in short supply.
Drivers are loading up with 50lb sacks of the versatile granules to give
their cars better traction in snow. Grocery chains are shifting twice as
much litter as normal, according to Supermarket News. And of course, cats
are staying indoors.

What do the J-League - Japan's football league launched last year - and the
country's stock market have in common?
It seems neither can thrive without gaijin - foreigner - support.
The J-League is now a huge craze, but its stars are foreign players from
South America and Europe. Similarly, the real players behind this year's
near 15 per cent rise in the Nikkei stock index are US and European buyers.
A record Dollars 12bn in overseas funds was pumped into the Tokyo stock
market in January alone.
Which craze will pass first? While Japan's football teams are happy to rely
on foreign players, some xenophobic financial authorities are starting to
worry about what happens when the foreigners stop buying.
They can 'guide' Japanese institutions when to buy or sell, but gaijin
investors can't be pushed around like foreign football stars. Well, not yet,
anyway.

If the European Central Bank has yet to pick a figurehead to engrave on its
banknotes, it could do worse than Mayer Amschel Rothschild, whose birth 250
years ago in Frankfurt was yesterday being celebrated by a gathering of the
clan in the German financial capital.
That at least was the respectful opinion of the town's mayor after listening
to the encomium delivered by Lord Jacob Rothschild to the founder of the
eminent banking dynasty.
The English Lord related how Mayer Amschel built up a prototypical European
Union when he sent out five of his sons on their famous journey from
Frankfurt's Jewish ghetto to European capital cities.
'He had a vision of a network of European countries collaborating and
improving their communal lot,' Lord Rothschild recalled, squeezing in a
quote from an essay penned by his Aunt Miriam.
As was readily apparent, the clan's knowledge of the lingo of western
Europe's largest country is virtually non-existent, and the group's axis is
indeed firmly Anglo-French. The German branch of the family died out in the
early years of the century, and the family had no presence in Frankfurt
until a small office was opened in 1989, which today has fewer than 10
professionals on its staff.
After Chancellor Kohl and retinue helped crown the proceedings last night at
the Jewish museum, it must surely be one of the most feted outposts in the
world.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Russia's move in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It was strangely obliging of the Bosnian Serb airforce to provide Nato with
such a clearcut casus belli.
Had the Serbs rejected last month's ultimatum, or resumed shelling Sarajevo
after the ultimatum expired, Nato would have had to launch air strikes
against Serb weapons in order to retain any credibility. But by doing so in
the teeth of strong Russian warnings, it would have risked a very serious
crisis both on the ground and in the UN Security Council.
As it was, both the Serbs and Nato were spared that confrontation by the
Russian intervention. That left an ambiguous situation in which no one was
quite sure who had won. Now, by a flagrant violation of the no-fly zone, the
Serbs have allowed Nato to establish its credibility unambiguously, but also
in circumstances of indisputable legality. Last March the Security Council
explicitly authorised 'member states . . . acting nationally or through
regional organisations or arrangements', to use force against aircraft
violating the NFZ.
Russia voted in favour of that resolution, and yesterday the Russian foreign
ministry supported Nato's action, while awaiting 'clarification' of the
aircraft's identity, which the Bosnian Serb command has tried to disclaim.
Thus the Serbs appear to have embarked on a strategy of escalation without
bothering to secure the support of their Russian protectors.
Already involved in a joint onslaught with the Croats on the Moslem enclave
of Maglaj, yesterday they also launched an intense heavy artillery attack on
the town of Tuzla and its airport, which the UN is hoping to reopen next
Monday. In addition, their chief of staff, General Manojlo Milovanovic, said
he would use weapons against aid convoys if the UN commander, General Sir
Michael Rose, acted on his decision to send them through Serb lines under
armed escort without applying for Serb permission.
All these actions are clear provocations to both the UN and Nato,
particularly the shelling of Tuzla (supposedly one of the UN's 'safe areas')
and its airport. Reopening the airport was the object of Nato's last
ultimatum but one - though it was inexplicably omitted from the more recent
one, the first to set a specific deadline. Nato is unlikely to react with
immediate air strikes, but Gen Rose may well call for air support if Gen
Milovanovic carries out his threat to attack UN-escorted convoys.
The Serbs are probing Nato, but thereby implicitly also testing the limits
of Russian support. This may actually be useful to Nato, which needs to know
how far it can count on Russia to moderate Serb behaviour. The correct
response for Nato at this stage is to hold back from further air strikes
unless the provocation is very direct (further violations of the NFZ, or
renewed shelling of Sarajevo), while asking Russia to use its influence with
the Serbs so that further ultimatums are not necessary.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Some hedge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hedge funds make splendid scapegoats for the recent turbulence in global
markets. But is one of the unstated risks in their frenetic and highly
leveraged operations that their importance is being exaggerated?
The size of the foreign exchange market is such that it seems implausible
that even Mr George Soros of Quantum Fund fame could have extracted sterling
from the exchange rate mechanism single-handed - and we only have Mr Soros's
word for the amount of profit he made in speculating against sterling. If
rumours of huge bond market losses among the hedge funds in recent days are
true, the main victims, apart from the managers, will be rich individuals
who knew what risks they were taking when they entrusted their money to
these off-shore buccaneers. At first sight, then, it may seem odd that the
Bank of England, whose concern in these matters is primarily to do with
systemic risk, should be looking into the issue.
Yet the central bankers cannot afford to ignore the likelihood that hedge
funds are often the counterparties of the commercial banks. In that sense
they may be systemically important. And the only undisputed facts about
these private pools of capital is that their managers borrow to speculate,
while revealing little information about their financial activities.
Much of what they do takes place not in the cash markets but in derivatives.
This, too, is an opaque and highly leveraged part of the global securities
system, since much of the dealing takes place in over-the-counter markets.
The precise location and extent of the risk is not always easy to identify.
There is thus obvious scope for the kind of problem that arose with the
collapse of the Herstatt bank in the 1970s or with the difficulties of
Drexel Burham in the 1980s, where central bankers felt obliged to help close
out the US investment bank's positions.
Estimates of hedge fund capital range from Dollars 30bn to Dollars 80bn.
With leverage, that could readily imply that they are taking positions in
the markets of Dollars 500bn upwards. But since there is no adequate
definition of the genus, it may be that such informal industry estimates
overstate the sums involved by including funds run by more conventional
managers.
The immediate need is clearly for information about counterparty risk in the
commercial banking system, in order to establish how the banks are
controlling their exposure to the hedge funds. If the exercises now being
conducted in Britain and the US indicate that the risk is exaggerated, so
much the better. If not, and the data permit, the case for tougher capital
requirements within the existing capital regime of the Bank for
International Settlements will be overwhelming. Where rich individuals are
being seduced into speculative mania by hedge fund gurus whose credentials
remain obscure, it seems all too plausible that the world's bankers will not
be far behind.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Leading Article: New-look TUC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Founded in 1868, Britain's Trades Union Congress is 'relaunching' itself.
The need is for a new product rather than new wrapping, since in the last
decade, the trade union movement's central body has been poorly led, has
generated few ideas and has found no takers for a civil service-style
bureaucracy to channel the voice of organised labour to government.
Today's official relaunch is a belated recognition of these facts. Mr John
Monks, TUC general secretary, wants to give the organisation a new sense of
direction, but one that acknowledges the hostile environment in which trade
unionism now operates and thus concentrates limited resources - Pounds 10m a
year - where they can add most value. To this end he has swept away most of
the old committee structures, where disputes were settled and policy
compromises forged. Over the coming months, he aims to reshape Congress
House to provide more efficent services to affiliated unions and to speak
more persuasively to the outside world.
Mr Monks deserves credit for these moves and for recognising that, if the
TUC is to become a more effective lobbying organisation in the manner of the
Confederation of British Industry, it has to win friends in government and
in all political parties. There is no reason why it should not achieve this.
Despite continuing decline, the trade union movement remains the largest
voluntary association in Britain, and more than half its members voted for
parties other than Labour at the last election.
But to justify its existence a trade union centre, like a national
employers' organisation, needs to contribute expert and constructive views
to the public policy debate about workplace issues, and to lead rather than
just reflect the dialogue within its member organisations.
Mr Monks needs to make a splash on issues like flexible labour contracts,
the changing shape of public sector employment and the need to control wage
inflation in the economic recovery. These are all controversial matters
within TUC-affiliated unions. Although Mr Monks represents a return to the
quiet, technocratic style of Len Murray, individual unions resent being
lectured by the TUC and some are already uneasy at the speed of the current
reforms. The emergence of the super-unions - such as Unison in the public
sector - may compound the problem as these organisations acquire larger
political ambitions in their own right.
The broader difficulty underlying the relaunch is the lack of a clear
concept of modern trade unionism. The need is for a trade unionism that
transcends collectivism, but which makes an assertive contribution to
fostering a fair but efficient framework of labour market regulation and
corporate law at a time when smaller, service-sector enterprises are of
increasing importance. If Mr Monks fails, the TUC may well be judged to have
had its day.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: No rationale for price controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr WILLIAM WALLACE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Christopher Johnson's summary of the National Commission on Education's
proposals (Personal View: 'Lesson in maximising human capital', February 23)
proposes to introduce market principles to higher education funding, through
recouping some of the additional earnings which successful graduates can
hope to make in later life. I am puzzled that he should stumble over his
logical conclusion, that universities should in turn be allowed to charge
students what the market will bear.
The government's current resistance to 'top-up' fees, which Mr Johnson
supports, is an oddly socialist position. 'It would,' he tells us, 'avoid
the most sought-after universities using the scheme . . . further to enhance
their relative advantage.' But he offers no rationale for this imposition of
price controls, which is likely in the long run to level down the quality of
the best universities through limiting their ability to raise income to
match their necessarily higher expenditure.
The impression given is of a poorly thought-out tactic intended to avoid
protests from middle-class Conservative voters, without considering its
implications for higher education strategy. Does the government want good
universities to get better - or does it wish to level down to a uniform
pattern of mass higher education?
If market principles are to be applied, there is no case for government
regulation to impose uniform fees across almost 100 universities. If Gatwick
Express is allowed to charge more for getting people there faster than
Network South-East, there is no justification for refusing to allow Oxford
to charge more for offering a premium service.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Why IRA eyes are smiling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The peace plan for Northern Ireland put forward by Mr Albert Reynolds and Mr
John Major has so far benefitted only the IRA and Sinn Fein, its political
wing. Optimists chirp that this is part of a process that may lead to a
ceasefire. The rest of us can only grit our teeth and bear it.
The Irish and UK prime ministers will say that their joint declaration of
December 15 stands. It is a permanent invitation to the terrorists to lay
down their arms and pursue their aims by democratic means. Maybe they will,
but there is no obvious reason why they should hurry. The president of Sinn
Fein, Mr Gerry Adams, is floating high on the oxygen of publicity. The IRA
has not ceased its violence. Its political front resists every opportunity
to condemn the use of the bomb and the bullet, let alone undertake to secure
their abandonment. While the nationalist side stands armed and firing, the
equally reprehensible 'loyalist' terrorists retaliate. Yet London, Dublin
and soppy liberals everywhere dance around Sinn Fein, in a ritual of
courtship that must bring a smile to the face of their president.
The list of concessions wrung out of the Irish and British governments is
depressing. Restrictions on broadcasts which had been in force for 23 years
have been lifted by the Irish government. This leaves the UK exposed, as it
maintains the absurd rule that Mr Adams and his cohorts may be seen, but not
heard, on TV. The use of dubbed actors' voices is a propaganda victory for
Sinn Fein every time one of its spokesmen appears. This 'censorship' has
enhanced Mr Adams's reputation in US eyes.
He was crowned media king for 48 hours after being granted a visa by US
President Bill Clinton, against the wish of the British, but not the Irish,
authorities. It may be that he will not be given a second opportunity to do
the rounds of the New York TV studios unless he first renounces violence.
Perhaps Mr Major is being assured of that during his visit to the White
House this week. It matters not, either way. Mr Adams has the cameras at his
fingertips. If he cannot go to them, they will come to him. His ability to
say that his voice may not be heard in Britain helps, not hinders, his
performance.
For the moment, he is a star of global communications. About a thousand
delegates attended the Sinn Fein conference in Dublin at the weekend. The
proceedings at-tracted 260 journalists from all parts of the world. Mr
Adams's leng-thy address was peppered with protestations of a desire for
peace. He said that 3,290 lives had been lost in 'the war' since 1969. He
calculated that the IRA was responsible for precisely 53 per cent of the
total deaths. His striking arithmetic omitted only the few words necessary
to end the killing.
Mr Adams had asked for 'clarification' of the Reynolds-Major declaration.
The Irish prime minister had responded amply; his British counterpart not
so. Yet Mr Major did his best in an article in the Irish News last Friday.
Mr Adams wants Britain to 'persuade' the Protestants to join a united
Ireland; Mr Major cannot agree. Would the same be true of a Labour prime
minister? Mr Adams demanded that the Unionist 'veto' on any future
constitution be lifted; the UK continues to explain patiently, as has Mr
Reynolds, that self-determination means that no solution can be imposed.
Most Irish voters support that basic principle.
All of this must be music to Sinn Fein ears. It is not getting its way, but
it is promoting its arguments. It is stringing the rest of us along,
squeezing the last drops of advantage out of the declaration. A small
minority party both north and south, it has repeatedly failed at the ballot
box. In general elections in 1992 it won less than 2 per cent of the vote in
the Irish republic and less than a tenth of the vote in Ulster. That is
barely a third of the potential Catholic turnout. Recent opinion polls
suggest that an overwhelming majority of the Irish people want the violence
to end.
Mr Adams protests that Sinn Fein is not the IRA, but if he had no influence
over the latter there would be no reason to pay attention to him. His tiny
party has been out in the cold, excluded from democratic politics by its
relationship with the men of violence. Now it is a player on the
international stage, the subject of respectable-sounding discourse, albeit
at arm's length, with the two prime ministers who carry responsibility for
the future shape of Ireland.
There was a further setback yesterday. Mr Major, with wobbly support from Mr
Reynolds, has been careful to maintain the acquiescence in the whole
strategy of the principal unionist party. By not opposing it, the Ulster
Unionists, led by Mr James Molyneaux, have kept the so-called peace
initiative afloat. In so doing he has risked losing the votes of his natural
supporters. Yesterday Mr Molyneaux pointedly rejected the notion of
multi-party talks at which representatives of his party and of Dublin were
both present. He prefers to get on with the establishment of an Ulster
assembly which, once elected, could do the talking. One strand of the
London-Dublin strategy has thus been snapped. It may eventually be restored.
Meanwhile such unionist posturing helps make Mr Adams's point for him.
In Irish eyes the above picture may seem less dismal than it does in London.
The real debate may be within Sinn Fein. The leaders of the latter are
masters of delay, but they need time in which to extract what they can from
the two democratic governments. Then, say the starry-eyed, they will call a
ceasefire. Only unionist impatience, or emotional outbursts by influential
Tory backbenchers, could upset that timetable. Perhaps. Meanwhile London and
Dublin will search for a move they can make on their own. It could be hard
to find.
There is no case for withdrawing the Major-Reynolds declaration, which is a
statement of principle that removes all props from the arguments favouring
violence. Talking to Ulster's democratic parties about a devolved assembly
was made more difficult by Mr Molyneaux yesterday, but it is not impossible.
Publishing the proposals worked up by Mr Adams with Mr John Hume, the leader
of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party might help. What
else? Britain and Ireland can only wait for peace. They have waited 25
years. How-ever awful, they could withstand another.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Up, up and away: Germany's runaway public sector debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the buses and trams stopped running in many parts of Germany for a
couple of hours early yesterday morning, most commuters reacted with calm
and good humour. They were only witnessing a brief rash of token strikes,
after all, and nothing like the widespread chaos caused by an 11-day
stoppage called by the public sector trade unions two years ago.
This time nobody believes that the unions will go that far. Not only are
they operating against a background of sharply rising unemployment; they are
negotiating with a bunch of employers whose coffers are visibly empty.
For once, the public sector pay round, covering some 3.5m workers ranging
from bus drivers to garbage collectors, school caretakers and postal
workers, has united the normally quarrelsome ranks of the German political
establishment.
From the ruling conservative-liberal coalition in Bonn, through the 16 state
governments, to the whole multiplicity of local authorities, ranks have
closed in favour of an outright pay freeze.
At every level of government in Germany, budgets are under extraordinary
pressure. It is not just the federal government in Bonn that is desperately
struggling to keep its net borrowing under DM70bn (Pounds 27.2bn) for the
second year in succession. The wealthy west German states will this year be
forced to borrow DM28.5bn on the capital markets, for the first time
exceeding their all-time record deficit of DM26.1bn in 1981.
In east Germany, the five 'new' federal states which began life at
unification in 1989 without any debts at all, now expect to borrow DM28bn
this year. By the end of 1994, they will have run up a debt mountain of
DM76bn.
As for the local authorities, their combined net borrowing this year will
add another DM22bn to the total, in spite of a severe squeeze on services.
At the weekend, Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's irrepressible finance minister,
sought to put the best possible gloss on the situation when he told his
Group of Seven colleagues about the prospects for economic recovery.
The Bonn government will cut its budget deficit from the current 3.5 per
cent of gross domestic product to less 3 per cent by 1995, he said - and
thus conform once again to the level laid down in the Maastricht treaty for
European economic and monetary union.
What he failed to mention was that at precisely the same time - in 1995 -
the overall public sector debt will sail through another Maastricht
convergence criterion, topping DM2,000bn, or rather more than 60 per cent of
GDP.
It is a prospect that is causing concern right through the German economic
and business establishment, not least because the process seems to be
unstoppable.
The Bundesbank warned in its latest monthly report that the total public
sector debt was approaching the Maastricht ceiling 'by leaps and bounds'.
According to a comprehensive analysis just published by the German chambers
of commerce and industry (DIHT), the public sector debt will reach
DM2,163.5bn in 1995, or 62.7 per cent of GDP.
What the DIHT is seeking to launch is an entire debate on the nature of
public spending, and the need for wholesale structural reforms, instead of
the piecemeal approach of annual savings packages adopted by Mr Waigel and
his colleagues in Bonn and the federal states.
In the first 30 years of the German federal republic, the public sector
accumulated a total debt of DM500bn, the DIHT says. In just five years since
German unification, the republic will have added double that amount, pushing
the debt burden up from DM1,039bn in 1990 to the forecast DM2,163.5bn next
year.
Unification is obviously one overwhelming factor for the surge. The other is
the explosion of social spending. The last straw has been the addition of
east German debts to the total: DM275bn from the Treuhand privatisation
agency will be taken over by the federal government next year, and some
DM125bn in debts from the former East German housing fund. Add to that some
DM80bn in the debt burden of the combined German railway system, assumed
from last January 1, and the DM2,000bn barrier will be easily surpassed.
What concerns the DIHT, however, is not just the scale of borrowing, but the
purpose to which it is put. For the level of consumption in public spending
has been steadily increasing at the expense of investment spending.
In the budgets of the federal states, for example, more than 82 per cent of
their combined spending of DM456bn last year was on the current account. Of
that, DM175bn, or 38.5 per cent of the total, was on the wage bill. Another
DM71.5bn was on administrative expenses. 'The Lander,' says the DIHT, 'are
becoming little more than labour-intensive service enterprises.'
The other main concern is that Mr Waigel's hope of bringing his net
borrowing back within 3 per cent of GDP is based on over-optimistic
assumptions of future economic growth.
The finance ministry's medium-term plan assumes a nominal growth rate of GDP
of 6 per cent a year up to 1997, and a 3 per cent annual spending limit. On
the basis of this the total net increase in debt would be DM288bn between
1993-97. The extra interest rate burden would add a further DM17.3bn,
assuming a 6 per cent interest rate.
Yet if the nominal growth is only 5 per cent, the accumulated deficit would
hit DM425.6bn, and the extra interest burden would total DM25.5bn.
It is a grim prospect for whichever party or parties win the coming national
elections in October, let alone the various state and local elections in the
offing.
The one man who is currently seeking to make political capital out of it is
a real outsider: Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the former economics minister, now
languishing in the wings of the Free Democratic party, plotting to get back
into power.
He has published a radical plan which would slash the number of federal
government ministries from 18 to 12, the number of members of parliament
from 662 to 500, and the number of federal states from 16 to 7. He wants to
slash subsidies to ailing sectors - such as agriculture - and increase
charges for public services across the board, like energy, water and sewage.
The trouble is that he is largely a discredited force, in his own party and
in the ruling coalition. He is unloved by the opposition SPD. So the
probability must be that the debt will go on soaring, and radical solutions
be rejected in favour of piecemeal savings.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Prime time for private funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IVOR KENNA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial comment ('Private finance', February 25) says that
private finance for public capital projects has yet to show any real
progress. Institutional investors prefer stock exchange securities with
proven track records.
A former president of the Institute of Actuaries and chief actuary to the
Prudential, Frank Redington, said, in a lecture on April 19 1977: 'The net
amounts passing between industry and long-term savings are small. To give
teeth to the point, in the 11 years 1965-75, industry raised Pounds 6bn in
new long-term capital, but it repaid Pounds 5 1/2 bn in cash acquisitions
(takeovers, trade investments, etc). The net requirement of Pounds  1/2 bn
compared with the growth of Pounds 24bn in institutional funds over the same
period.'
The Pounds 23 1/2 bn went into the purchase of already existing stocks and
shares. It could not affect the income-earning potential of the underlying
companies at all. If this money had gone into public capital projects, the
country could have had new road and rail systems, the second Severn Bridge,
etc. The institutions would have had the income from all these projects.
A similar situation exists today. There is no time to lose in investigating
the position. As the Labour party document points out, 'there are plenty of
competing capital projects at home and abroad' (my emphasis).

FT  01 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Belief, claims and facts on the
Catholic Church
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NORMAN WILLIAM SMITH Jnr
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, So many mis-statements are contained in the Very Rev Hugh Dickinson's
article, 'Not all roads lead to Rome' (February 12).
His claim of a 'steady stream' of American Catholics into the US Protestant
Episcopal Church conflicts with that denomination's documented loss of
almost one-third of its membership over the last decade.
His assertion that 'the bodily assumption of the Virgin Mary into heaven is
a belief necessary for salvation' misrepresents the role of dogma in the
Catholic Church. He coins the phrase 'Papal fundamentalism' (without even
bothering to define the term) and then darkly equates it with 'biblical
fundamentalism'. Is it really 'equally oppressive' to be asked to believe:
a) that God preserved the body of the Virgin Mary from earthly corruption,
and b) that God created the world in six calendar days?
He characterises the Papal ban on contraception as an 'outrage against
conscience and reason and is known to be by the majority of Roman Catholic
lay people and priests'. True, a majority of Catholic laity appears either
to dissent from or otherwise to disregard the teaching; but it can only be a
small, small minority that characterises it an 'outrage'.
Dr Dickinson attributes the stability of faith in the Catholic Church to an
'absolute authority . . . (that) can never admit that it was wrong'. But
this overlooks the more basic point that, if Christ's teachings on faith and
morality are themselves authentic, and if one believes that Christ protects
'the Church' from 'error', one would assume a fairly consistent and uniform
interpretation down through the centuries, whether or not its structure was
'authoritarian'.
Whenever any man, theologian or scientist, changes his views, he necessarily
begs the question: were you right then or now? For a 'church' to denigrate
the beliefs of its ancestors in faith can only prompt the same question.
Organised religion, whether Christian or otherwise, has been characterised
as a union of faith, morality, and liturgy. True, one can identify
'churches' which trivialise faith and morality. Shinto presents the best
case. But the American experience suggests that the 'market' for such a
'church' is extremely small. In diminishing the importance of belief and
morality, the Anglican Church is pursuing a 'market niche' of small
dimensions. A liturgy, regardless of how 'Catholic', will not sustain its
membership.
Finally, as in an earlier piece on Bishop David Jenkins, he betrays a deep
antipathy to any 'faith' not buttressed by demonstrable scientific evidence.
But how different this is from the attitude of Christ Himself, for whom
'faith' was superior to verified knowledge (John 20:29).

FT  01 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Capital reform for Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J H MURRAY WILLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Reform is due for the Lloyd's method of allocating capital to
syndicates by queueing or, to quote the Lex column (February 19), granting
of 'grace-and-favour indulgence'. Its replacement with the adoption of a
value/trading system for syndicate shares would bring an improvement in
efficiency of the market for the benefit of all Lloyd's investors.
Corporate members, whose share prices reflect value for their 1994 account
syndicate participations, have no grounds for objection to this. Indeed, the
greatest benefit professional corporate investors can bring to Lloyd's is
the demand for the introduction of further investor rights enjoyed in other
capital markets.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Case for stricter accounting of
German corporations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr THOMAS HEIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, With reference to John Craven's article (Management: 'Testimony to the
German system', February 18), enthusiasts of the German model of corporate
governance have long praised the system for its allegedly superior long-term
performance. Mr Craven, chairman of merchant bankers Morgan Grenfell, a
Deutsche Bank subsidiary, now claims that the German model merits praise for
its superiority against others with respect to its capacity for short-term
handling of corporate failure, like the one that occurred at
Metallgesellschaft AG.
What Mr Craven can book as a natural advantage in the successful rescue of
Metallgesellschaft AG is seen by many in this country as the cornerstone of
an organised system of unaccountability that has created much of the
rigidity and stagnation that we face in German society. The talk here is of
the virtually closed and highly centralised system of decision-making in the
German model of corporate governance.
There is an urgent need to end the cosy relationships in German corporatism
and to remind everyone of the individual responsibility owed to a business.
It is not acceptable that public banks, as occurred in the rescue of
Metallgesellschaft AG, are actively engaged in securing the gambling risks
of badly controlled managers from private corporations. Since the current
German model of corporate governance seems to be built on weak moral grounds
you should not be surprised to hear more energetic calls for stricter
accounting rules.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Arts: Tactile works in wax and clay - William Packer on a
surprising and ambiguous retrospective of the work of Medardo Rosso, a
contemporary of Rodin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Medardo Rosso was born in Turin in 1858. A spell of soldiering took him
through his early 20s and it was not until he was 24 that he turned
seriously to art, entering the Brera Academy in Milan in the summer of 1882.
That too did not last long. Barely a year later he had been expelled for
insubordination and taken himself off to show at that year's International
Exhibition of Fine Art in Rome.
From that moment he was clearly an actor on the international stage, showing
his work in major exhibitions at every opportunity - now at the Salon des
Independants in Paris, now in Venice, now in London, at the Albert Hall. He
was already travelling widely, and in 1889 he moved to Paris where he was to
keep a studio almost until the end of his life. For the next 30 years he was
acknowledged with Rodin as the principal sculptor of impressionism, his work
shown throughout Europe. In 1898, when Rodin's Balzac was first shown, Rosso
was cited as putative influence - their friendship ended soon after.
Boccioni and Marinetti saw him as the revolutionary forerunner of Futurism.
Upon Rodin's death in 1917, Apollinaire declared him the greatest sculptor
alive.
Six years on and the furniture in the Paris studio had been taken by the
bailiffs against unpaid rent. He continued to show, mainly in Italy where he
was still held in high regard, but the sense now is of a career and
reputation in decline. He died in hospital in Milan in 1928, a little short
of his 70th birthday, after having had a leg amputated following an accident
to his foot.
And now? Rosso's sculpture, these many years past, has been honoured more in
the form than the true observance, the work seldom seen and only in the
isolated and occasional example. This full - though still quite small - and
proper retrospective study is, therefore, of real art-historical moment, a
true event.
Whether it gives us the Rosso we might have expected, Rosso the
proto-Futurist, the suggestive, symbolic impressionist, is another matter.
What we do get is someone altogether more ambiguous and surprising, at once
more thoroughly old-fashioned and more profoundly radical and prescient than
we supposed.
He was never a carver: his materials were those of the modeller, clay and
wax, by which the image may be realised directly and quickly, and either
left as it is or cast into plaster or bronze. And as a modeller, the young
Rosso works soundly enough within the genre conventions of the mid-19th
century, looking to the domesticity of Dalou, to the symbolism of Rodin, and
perhaps back a little to the satirical figurines of Daumier. But he brings
to such work his own peculiar attack, a rapid and tactile expressiveness in
the actual working of the clay, which soon enough becomes an end in itself.
It is in this development that his revolutionary quality lies, and which
today makes his work so relevant to current practice and preoccupation. What
intrigued his contemporaries was the way in which increasingly he came to
establish the most fleeting suggestion of head or face, a cast of
countenance caught in the wing, with but most minimal apparent intervention
on his part. There was the impression, to be viewed perhaps from one side of
what was manifestly still a lump of stuff. Yet the quality of that image, so
beautiful, so delicate and haunting, as though seen through a veil, was what
caught the fin-de-siecle symbolist imagination.
Rosso's habit was to make several versions of an image in parallel though
not necessarily from the same original, now wax, now bronze, now plaster,
each as close as possible but still different in its finish. Any original
clay model would inevitably be destroyed in any case, in the making of the
plaster mould for subsequent casts. Similarly, by the lost-wax process, the
wax would be, well, lost. But each material, plaster, bronze or wax, has its
particular qualities, and here repeatedly we consider the variations, side
by side - the matt, light-absorbent surface of the plaster, the heavy,
patinated bronze, the translucent wax.
Imagery apart, what we are left with are these differences, and physical and
material differences at that. In noting them, we respond to them for being
what they are in material terms of stuff and substance. Here is a chunk of
plaster or a wilfully rough concavity of bronze, with a most delicate and
sophisticated image on it right enough, but also an inside and an outside, a
back and front. There it is, not so much for what it might be as for what it
is. Take it or leave it. Such is Rosso's modernism as it speaks to us today.
Medardo Rosso: Whitechapel Art Gallery, Whitechapel High Street E1, until
April 24, then on to Edinburgh and Leeds - a national touring exhibition
from the South Bank Centre, sponsored by British Telecom.

Are you agog to know why the relationship between the American president and
the White House press corps is so bad? Assignment will tell you (7.45 BBC2).
I shall watch The Long Summer, Channel 4's repeat of a series about Britain
between 1919 and 1939 most of which I missed on initial transmission. This
opening episode considers changing feelings about home and suburbia (8.00).
ITV offers three drama series, one on top of the other. The Bill, (8.00) a
half hour police drama, sustains a remarkably high standard. In September
Song comedian Russ Abbot plays the straight man and straight actor Michael
Williams is the comedian. 'Bitter sweet' we said of the first series: can
they keep it up? (8.30) Peak Practice is an unremarkable soap about rural
doctors (9.00).
'The ultimate sexual symbol' is considered by Camille Paglia at 9.30 in the
second half of Without Walls: 'The Penis Unsheathed' (C4). ITV's Tuesday

FT  01 MAR 94 / Arts: Young soloists take centre stage - Weekend recitals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There were notable recitals by two young artists this past weekend, but of
different orders. At the Barbican on Sunday afternoon we had the phenomenal
Siberian-Israeli violinist Maxim Vengerov, aged nineteen-and-a-half years.
At the Wigmore Hall the night before, the pianist Peter Jablonski - three
years older - was the latest 'Outstanding Young Artist' in the Marks &amp;
Spencer series. Jablonski was fluent, finely sensitive, technically
well-schooled and full of maturing promise. Vengerov, however, is something
extraordinary, so preternaturally 'natural' a violinist as to compel rapt
attention and awe as well as delight.
As is his wont, he chose an eminently serious programme, leaving spectacular
feats for the Wieniawski Polonaise at the end and for his encores - just two
Kreislers and a sort of frantic galop by Bazzini, all dazzlingly brilliant.
(At the Wigmore last March, he spun off showpiece encores for some 40
minutes.) Vengerov is a glorious champion of such old-fashioned stuff, as
you would expect of a Compleat Violinist like him. Almost invariably it was
composed by master-performers, who knew better than anybody how to exploit
the possibilities of the instrument to the limit. He does them full honour.
In classical works he exercises respectful self-restraint. Here, he began
with Mozart's K. 305 Sonata in A, in which the piano almost shades the
violin, and then proceeded to old Brahms's lovely, vernal Sonata in G.
Though Vengerov is fortunate in his current piano partner - Itamar Golan, no
mere accompanist but an imaginative virtuoso in his own right - it took them
most of the recital to find a just balance in the Barbican acoustic.
In the Mozart, designed for a much lighter 'harpsichord or fortepiano', and
sometimes in Brahms too, the piano overweighed the violin. After the
interval, when perhaps somebody had warned them, Golan was self-effacing to
a fault in Prokofiev's visionary F minor Sonata, black and brooding. Little
harm was done, for Vengerov pursues a musical line with such full-hearted
intensity, always smoothly controlled but speaking volumes, that one has to
listen like the Ancient Mariner's guest. He thinks in very long paragraphs,
not just phrases. In fact his seamlessly articulate legato in Brahms risked
leaving too few breathing-spaces for comfort - but while it went on, nobody
could conceivably complain.
Until he let his hair down for his sensational Wieniawski and the encores,
it was the Prokofiev that displayed Vengerov's superb gifts at fullest
stretch. Jablonski too was at his best in Prokofiev, the angry, nervy
Seventh Sonata; it was impressively taut and searching, if without the
ultimate degree of scathing force.
Similarly, the first and last pieces of Debussy's Book I Images built
admirably toward climaxes which proved rather mild when they arrived - like
Liszt's fustian 'St. Francis Walking on the Water', too loosely aqueous (and
too foxed by finger-slips). In four Scarlatti sonatas Jablonski offered less
fantasy and less vital 'ping' than Leon McCawley two weeks ago, but a
subtler, more delicate sound-palette. His F minor sonata K466 was
beautifully imagined, a transparent dream of melancholy.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Arts: Schnittke's broken symphonies - New York Music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two new symphonies by Alfred Schnittke, his Sixth and Seventh, were
introduced to New York last month in a sudden succession that mirrored, if
it slightly exaggerated, his productivity. Since writing them (the Sixth was
finished in 1992, the Seventh last July) he has already completed his Eighth
Symphony, and his output of the last five years also includes several other
big orchestral scores, chamber pieces, and two full-length operas, of which
a long-planned Faust is scheduled for production next year in Hamburg.
Quite how to interpret this rate of output is one of the Schnittke
conundrums. Are we dealing with a Haydn, composing fluently to order, or
with a Hugo Wolf, impelled by creative demons? Much has been made of
Schnittke's music as reportage on the speed of events in his native Russia.
Much has been made, too, of his physical fragility - and indeed he looked
sadly aged well beyond his 59 years as he was assisted onto the platform at
each of these concerts. But the music is disinclined - perhaps even unable -
to explain itself: its very brokenness makes it mute as to causes. What we
hear is the wreckage; how it happened is left for us to wonder, if we wish.
Both the new works are broken, wrecked symphonies, but especially the Sixth.
It has the usual four movements, with a conventional scale, playing
altogether for about half an hour. The contents, though, are weird even by
Schnittke's standards. The first movement, for instance, starts and ends
with big clusters, but the long interim is thinly scored, and made up of
fragments that have no great pretensions: for long periods the stage is held
by a few brass instruments in chorales, or by low strings, again often in
quasi-liturgical phrases. One remembers that Schnittke's Second and Fourth
symphonies were muffled religious ceremonies, but the feeling here is bare
and wretched, and the great numbers who piled out of Carnegie Hall after
this movement seemed to be making an understandable response.
The Sixth Symphony was written for Mstislav Rostropovich and the National
Symphony, who gave this performance; the Seventh, a New York Philharmonic
commission being heard for the first time, was composed for another
conductor with whom Schnittke has had a long association: Kurt Masur. It is
a more compact piece than the Sixth, lasting little longer than twenty
minutes, and a more continuous one. There are now three movements, and the
first two are both so short as to seem preludial, the opening andante being
for strings and its successor turning to the wind and percussion. Then in
what emerges as the main movement, the horns quite soon introduce a
waltz-chorale that appears to satisfy demands for a principal theme.
But the new symphony is hardly less bleak than its predecessor. Even its
continuity is not so much growth as wandering (in the case of the long
opening for solo violin) or idling repetition - or finally both at once, as
the slow waltz tune is played three times identically by soloists in the far
bass (trombone, contrabassoon, double bass). It is a haunting melody, but
not a soothing one, and its insufficiency as a gesture of farewell
consolation is perhaps its point. Schnittke, living now in Germany, pays
homage to that country by encoding German place-names into the second
movement, but ironically the notes he gets from 'Deutschland' come very
close to the DSCH cryptogram with which Shostakovich signed several of his
works, and it is to Shostakovich's example that this new symphony, like so
much of Schnittke's music, most conspicuously appeals. Shostakovich was, of
necessity, a master of musical double-talk: of hollow affirmations, of
savage glee. Schnittke opens up several further layers of splitting, and
leaves us with music whose motivations are endlessly tangled, music whose
increasing austerity has only made it ever more uncertain and unsettling.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Technology: The century's last take-off - Paul Betts reports
on next month's introduction of the world's biggest twin-engine airliner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a Guinness Book of Records quality about the 777, the world's
biggest twin-engine airliner which Boeing, the world's biggest aircraft
manufacturer, will roll out for the first time on April 9.
The first 300-400 seat airliners are being assembled outside Seattle in the
US in a 1,000-acre site with about 98 acres of buildings under one roof. The
aircraft will be the last all-new airliner programme developed this century,
at a cost of more than Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.7bn).
The three leading aero-engine manufacturers - Pratt &amp; Whitney and General
Electric of the US and Rolls-Royce of the UK - are scrambling to develop the
world's most powerful commercial jet engines to power the 777 and future,
even larger, derivatives of the new Boeing widebody airliner.
Since launching the 777 programme four years ago, it has again been
'bet-the-company time' for Boeing, say senior executives. The development
costs and lead times are so significant that an aircraft manufacturer risks
the health of the entire company every time it launches a big new programme,
they explain.
'It's certainly a gamble, but the 777 is not as big a gamble as our decision
to launch the 747 programme 25 years ago,' says Philip Condit, Boeing's
president. Part of the reason for Boeing's greater confidence this time is
the way the company has changed its approach to developing an aircraft.
Boeing describes the 777 as a 'market-driven' airliner. In the past, the
manufacturer felt it knew what was best for its airline customers. 'Market
planning for a new airliner was often based on the requirements of a launch
customer, combined with some rough expectations about future markets,'
explains Jeff Peace, chief project engineer of Boeing's 777 division.
'The manufacturer would come up with a general idea for a new aircraft,
convince an airline to buy it, then design it pretty much around the
capabilities and features described by the launch airline,' he adds.
With the 777, Boeing adopted from the start a more open stance towards the
outside world, encouraging airlines, suppliers and subcontractors to
participate actively in the design and planning of the new airliner.
'Not that we did not listen to our customers in the past, but the biggest
lesson we learnt was that we often listened to them late in a programme,'
says Alan Mulally, the 777's general programme manager. 'Now, we are
listening to them much earlier.'
At all costs, the company wanted to avoid the mistakes made five years ago
on the development of the 747-400, the newest version of its 747 jumbo.
After failing to listen properly to its customers, Boeing was forced to
delay delivery for several months to initial customers because of teething
problems and design changes demanded by airlines.
Boeing's new attitude to customers, subcontractors and suppliers also
reflected two important changes in the market. The first was the general
slump in the civil aircraft business with airlines forced by heavy losses to
cancel or postpone millions of dollars worth of new aircraft orders. The
second and perhaps even more important factor was the emergence of Airbus
Industrie as Boeing's principal long-term challenger.
The European aircraft manufacturing consortium, which has steadily built
market share during the past 20 years by launching advanced new aircraft
programmes, has been making serious inroads into some of Boeing's
traditional customers in the US.
With nearly 30 per cent of the western market, Airbus has sought to leapfrog
its bigger US rival by introducing new technological concepts to commercial
jets including fly-by-wire electronic controls. It also pre-empted Boeing by
launching a new widebody family of aircraft with the A330 twin-engine
airliner and its sister aircraft, the four-engine A340, increasingly
challenging Boeing's dominance of the large airliner market.
Boeing's response was to go out to the airlines to find out what exactly
they wanted for their future fleet requirements. It initially consulted
eight (Delta, American and United in the US, British Airways in Europe,
Japan Airlines, All Nippon Airways, Cathay Pacific and Qantas in the
Asia-Pacific region) to define the 777's configuration and purpose.
It formed specialist task forces to analyse its most important operational
aspects, including everything from cargo loading to flight deck layout. It
then set up special design-build teams with the 777's three launch
customers: BA, All Nippon and United.
BA sent a four-man team to Seattle where they were given access to all
Boeing design staff and became deeply involved in the design process. Boeing
introduced a similar working relationship with the engine manufacturers and
other suppliers. It also formed 235 design-build teams inside the company to
enable employees from all company divisions to work together as well as with
airlines and outside suppliers. These teams have been sharing a common
database to help them communicate quickly.
Barry Gosnold, the head of BA's engineering activities in Seattle, says the
Boeing-BA team has led to more than 100 changes to the basic specification
of the aircraft. Changes have also been made to improve the maintainability
of the aircraft and to ensure that the airliner is 'service ready' from the
first day it enters into service with BA in the second half of next year.
BA says that among the most significant changes it has made was to persuade
Boeing to adopt radial tyres, a device to store all the aircraft's loadable
software, and a space-saving galley allowing an additional four passenger
seats to be fitted to the cabin.
Another benefit of the intensive customer dialogue was the decision to make
about 80 different items traditionally offered as optional features on other
aircraft as standard equipment on the 777. This included satellite and
global positioning systems, increasingly important aircraft safety and
navigational tools which are basic to the 777.
Boeing admits that the way it has designed and developed the 777 is
tantamount to a cultural and technical revolution for the traditionally 'do
it alone' manufacturer. In many respects, it is also a return to the past.
As Condit puts it: 'We are attempting to recapture the team spirit from the
company's early days. In a sense, we're looking back to create the future.'
Collaboration is now set to intensify on future aircraft programmes. The two
biggest challenges for the industry in the next century will be the
development of a superjumbo airliner capable of seating 600 to 800
passengers and a second-generation supersonic aircraft to replace Concorde
with a longer range and about three times Concorde's 100 passenger seating
capacity. On both these longer term projects, Boeing is already involved in
joint studies with other leading manufacturers, including the four European
Airbus partner companies, and with potential airline customers.
Ultimately, however, the driving force behind Boeing's new, more open
attitude to collaboration is to maintain its 60 per cent share of the
commercial aircraft market. 'We will be focusing more than ever on our
customers' requirements because we don't want to be left behind to allow
someone else in,' Condit says.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Technology: Milking time on transgenic farm - Human drugs
are being produced by livestock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jonathan MacQuitty, chief executive of GenPharm International, a
California-based biotechnology group, bristled with fatherly pride when he
announced in January the birth of eight calves at his livestock operation in
the Netherlands.
These are not just any calves. They are the first transgenic offspring of
Herman, the world's first transgenic bull. Like their father, the calves
carry a gene for the production of human lactoferrin, an antibacterial
protein normally produced in human milk. By milking the calves to obtain the
protein, the company hopes eventually to have an entire farm pumping out
lactoferrin for the world market.
'One of the advantages is that you could take your medicine by pouring the
milk into your morning bowl of cereal,' says MacQuitty. Lactoferrin may
protect against bacterial infections of the gastrointestinal track.
Several biotechnology groups - including GenPharm, Genzyme Transgenics and
DNX in the US, and Pharmaceutical Proteins in Scotland - are pushing ahead
with plans to produce sophisticated drugs through livestock. Genzyme has a
herd of transgenic goats, DNX works with sheep and pigs and Pharmaceutical
Proteins with sheep.
Transgenic livestock is created by micro-injecting an artificial gene into a
fertilised egg. Essentially, the egg is given extra DNA information.
'Assembling the correct pieces of DNA is the difficult part,' says
MacQuitty.
The egg is then placed inside the female who later bears the calf, lamb or
piglet. Once transgenic livestock has been created, the animal is cross-bred
with non-transgenic livestock. The hope is that about half the offspring
will also be transgenic, although levels are running closer to 40 per cent
at most operations.
Companies are looking to genetic farming to cut down on production costs for
certain proteins. 'We believe the cost savings will be dramatic,' says James
Geraghty, president of Genzyme Transgenics, a subsidiary of Boston-based
Genzyme. 'Capital costs would probably be a tenth of what it costs to build
a factory, and the unit cost of production would be half of the cost we see
today.'
Some of the drugs companies are looking to produce are: Factor H, a clotting
molecule used to treat haemophiliacs; human haemoglobin, a blood substitute;
and human collagen, to treat incontinence.
Producing drugs through livestock may have its limitations. 'I think this is
only cost effective if you're dealing with proteins you need in large
quantities, and with large molecules which are easy to separate out,' says
John Logan, vice president of research at DNX.
Other companies believe the technique has wider applications. Genzyme is
looking to livestock farming to produce drugs that cannot be made in the
laboratory. 'It may be the only way to produce membrane-bound proteins such
as one we're working on for cystic fibrosis,' says Geraghty.
DNX is also exploring new options, such as organ production for use in
transplant surgery. Because of the severe shortage of human organ donors in
the US, organ transplant surgeons are keen to turn to animal organs. But
inflammatory proteins of the immune system, known as complement, can destory
the transplanted organ within hours or even minutes.
Complement is normally held in check through inhibitors. To increase the
chance of the organs' acceptance, DNX has expressed the human complement
inhibitor gene in transgenic pigs. 'There's no way to grow an organ in a
laboratory,' says Logan, 'so this is the way to go for organ transplants.'
Transgenic farming is still in its early stages. Most products will not even
start clinical trials, the first stage on the road to commercial approval,
until the end of 1995.
However, there are encouraging signs that the technique will eventually be
viable for large-scale drug production. With new generations of transgenic
livestock appearing, the genes are seen as increasingly stable. And
potential applications for the technique are expanding.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Management: Intrastat system criticised - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior managers of exporting companies spend as much as 10 hours a month
filling out intrastat returns for HM Customs, according to a survey by
Community Network Services.
All companies with exports and imports - or what are now called arrivals and
despatches from the EU - of more than Pounds 140,000 are required to fill in
the returns. But since intrastat was introduced at the start of 1993, the
system has been criticised for under-estimating the volume of UK imports.
Some analysts, such as UBS's Bill Martin, say the import figures are as much
as 50 per cent adrift. Now it appears the system is also eating into the
time that managements could be spending developing their businesses. The
returns are often filled out by management accountants, company secretaries
or financial controllers.
However, according to CNS, which offers a software package to help put
together the intrastat data, only 9 per cent of companies submit returns by
floppy disk and only 4 per cent used a modem or another form of electronic
data interchange. The rest submitted their returns on paper.

Companies that have failed to register under the 1984 Data Protection Act
risk fines of at least Pounds 5,000.
While 182,000 organisations have registered, some 150,000 computer users
have yet to do so, according to the national audit office.
Under the act, any organisation that keeps details about living people on
computer - even just names and addresses - must register their use of the
information.
The Data Protection Register is to launch a campaign to encourage
compliance. Failure to register is a criminal offence and can lead to fines
of Pounds 5,000 in the lower courts and unlimited fines in higher courts.

Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Should companies investigated, but cleared, by the Inland Revenue, receive
compensation for their costs?
Companies in this situation are calling for a central fund to help alleviate
what can be a damaging experience for smaller companies. During an
investigation, they are often required to produce large numbers of historic
statements, for which banks charge.
Even if there is no direct cost, the loss of key management time can extract
a very high price in time and wasted opportunities.
Ironically, as the law stands, companies might be better off going to court
to clear their name. If they won the case, costs would normally be awarded
against the Inland Revenue and would include costs for preparing the case.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Management: Government urged to produce report - In a
Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Michael Grylls MP, chairman of the Conservative backbench committee on
trade and industry, has been persuaded to withdraw a private members' bill
calling for the government to produce an annual report on smaller companies.
But the government is still likely to produce some form of report. Lord
Strathclyde, small business' minister, says he is keen to have such a
report.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Management: Companies seek more help - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Small companies believe the UK government should be playing a greater role
in helping them gain access to finance, according to a survey of 750
companies carried out by the British Chambers of Commerce.
About 80 per cent thought the government could provide more help. It could
help to create low, fixed rate and longer-term borrowing for small
companies.
It could also reduce 'red tape', particularly that involved in applying for
finance under the Loan Guarantee Scheme, which is now available up to Pounds
250,000 and can be taken as part of packages of finance that include bank
debt.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Management: British David takes on US Goliaths - Meiko is a
private UK company in a sector dominated by American rivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATE BUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is rare for a small, private UK company to venture into the global market
of an industry that is indisputably led by the US, and beat all comers
hands-down. But Bristol-based Meiko has done just that.
Founded in 1985 by six engineers who specialised in the concept of
high-performance computing, Meiko now employs 180 people and has an
installed worldwide base of more than 440 systems.
The company's key technology is massively parallel processing (MPP), a tiny
new supercomputing sector, estimated to be worth Dollars 890m (Pounds 610m)
by 1996, with an annual growth rate of 25 per cent. MPP systems combine
hundreds or even thousands of cheap commodity chips to create much higher
processing power at a much lower price than conventional supercomputers.
Meiko has been catapulted into competition with established big companies
such as Cray Research, International Business Machines and Thinking
Machines. Meiko is estimated to have cornered 25 per cent of the global MPP
market and is the industry leader in Europe.
The only big UK company in the field, Meiko sees itself as a cosmopolitan
contender. 'We are a global company working with global customers in a
global market,' insists John Fuchs-Chesney, director of the UK holding
company, Meiko Limited of Bristol, and executive vice-president of Meiko
Scientific, the US subsidiary based in Waltham, Massachusetts.
Meiko's international qualities were a critical component in a bidding match
that upset the supercomputing industry in July 1993. Meiko beat all US
competitors on their home turf when it won the pitch to supply the
government-funded Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, California, with
its latest and most powerful machine, the CS2 (Computing Surface 2). 'Were
Meiko a purely British operation, we would never have won that contract,'
says Fuchs-Chesney.
US competitors claimed that national security would be jeopardised, but
Meiko had made sure that the terms of sale in both cases satisfied all
federal and national requirements for the US and the UK.
'If the guys at Livermore decided that this is what they want, they should
be able to buy it,' comments Gary Smaby, a Minneapolis-based market
researcher.
The indignant clamour from the competition has abated since preliminary
acceptance trials run by Livermore proved successful. 'The outcome of the
tests was better than we expected,' says Mark Seager, who runs the testing
unit at Livermore. 'The acceptance criteria were some of the most stringent
we have ever imposed.'
Meiko's unpublished revenues are said to have doubled in 1993 with this
single Dollars 17.5m sale.
Despite this coup, Fuchs-Chesney is reluctant to dramatise the company's
success. Whereas the US high-tech industry is prone to taking immature
companies public, Meiko is cautious about cashing in on success prematurely.
'These things take time,' says Fuchs-Chesney. 'It may take three to five
years of development with a client before they buy into the risk of a new
market sector.'

FT  01 MAR 94 / Management: Making a mark - Richard Gourlay considers Lord
Strathclyde's role as UK minister for small businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Lord Strathclyde first took his seat at the Palace of Westminster at
the age of 26, police inside would not believe he was a noble lord.
Eight years on, and now minister for small businesses at the department of
trade and industry, Lord Strathclyde has lost none of his boyish looks and
enthusiasm. His age was initially some concern to the vociferous
small-business lobby. With only six years' work experience at insurance
company Bain Clarkson, what could he know of small business' concerns, some
asked.
He was, furthermore, following a procession of ministers who had passed
through the department with such speed that it seemed government support for
small businesses was little more than rhetoric. But Lord Strathclyde has
prompted pleasant surprise in the six months since he replaced Baroness
Denton. Where she was ultimately criticised for not modifying her strong
opinions, Lord Strathclyde has impressed audiences with his open mind and an
ability to pick up complex briefs.
However, the direction in which he seems to be leaning has not been so
widely welcomed. There is guarded optimism among people who want government
increasingly to focus its small-business support services on the few
businesses that have a real chance of growing, creating jobs and wealth.
Those who want support services to be spread more thinly among a greater
number of smaller businesses are less pleased.
A careful politician, Lord Strathclyde does not dismiss the value of what
are often called 'lifestyle businesses', companies which have little
prospect of growing and creating wealth. But his policy emphasis is clear.
'Sole traders are very important. They are crucial to local areas but the
area we want to concentrate on is those businesses with an equity gap that
want to expand, that are entrepreneurial,' he says.
This preference is well illustrated by plans to revamp the consultancy
service currently offered under the Enterprise Initiative, for example. Lord
Strathclyde says: 'It will be fewer companies that come into the net but
those that do come in will get more out of it.'
While Lord Strathclyde is developing his own views, there is no doubt his
task is aided by fresh enthusiasm for smaller companies within the
government. 'In the last three or four months there has been a step change
in the way government and other organisations treat small firms,' he says.
The chancellor's last Budget put the funding gap on the agenda, with the
announcement of a replacement for the Business Expansion Scheme and new
venture capital investment trusts. He also focused the debate about
legislation to counter late payment and relaxed a number of administrative
rules, such as the need for smaller companies to have a full audit.
'I think Ken Clarke (the chancellor) is genuinely very keen on this area of
the economy,' Lord Strathclyde says. 'I see my role first to represent
government policy and how it affects small business, and to make sure my
colleagues in government are not thinking of legislation which will damage
the interests of small businesses,' he says. But there are specific areas
where he would like to leave a mark.
His first priority is Business Link, a project championed by Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, which is designed to bring the
government's support services together in one-stop shops. He says 50 of the
200 planned outlets will be open by the end of the year. 'We need to reach
not so much the people who don't know they exist but those that don't know
they need the services. And we have to counter the view that what is on
offer from government is cheap and shoddy.'
Another priority is to sort out the issue of late payment. Lord Strathclyde
says he 'walked into the issue' on his first day, has welcomed the quality
of the formal submissions but remains agnostic on whether there should be a
statutory right to interest on late debts.
On finance, he would like to see greater use of the Loan Guarantee Scheme,
recently raised to Pounds 250,000, as part of a package of finance. He
recognises that investors in private companies need exit routes and supports
calls for some form of third market to replace the Unlisted Securities
Market. 'I would like to see what the Stock Exchange is proposing although
it doesn't have to be under the Stock Exchange's auspices.'

FT  01 MAR 94 / People: Avon Rubber plumps for Willcox
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tony Mitchard, who worked his way through the ranks at Avon Rubber from
clerk to chief executive, is to bow out this December at the age of 60 after
more than 40 years at the tyre and motor components company.
He will be replaced by the head of Avon's industrial polymers division,
Stephen Willcox, 47, (above). The succession was decided after months of
deliberation by a board torn between Willcox and the finance director, John
Harper.
In the end, Willcox, who joined Avon as a graduate trainee in 1968 and only
left briefly for a stint at Miles Laboratories, won the race by a nose.
While the appointment was welcomed in the City, some suggest the new regime
would face greater pressure to perform. 'We do not mind who is running it as
long as he does better than has been done in the past,' says one analyst.
'There has been a regular deferment of profits growth . . . and as a result
a degree of impatience about the performance.'
Mitchard, whose outgoing style contrasts sharply with the quieter approach
of Willcox, is widely credited with having transformed Avon from a sleepy UK
industrial group. However, the group's purchase of Cadillac Rubber and
Plastics in the US in 1988 took longer than expected to bring benefits,
partly because of recession but because of its dependence on a few
automobile manufacturers.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Business and the Law: A taxing task for partners - How to
cope with the move to self-assessment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 1994 Finance Bill contains what accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand calls 'the
most wide-ranging reforms of personal tax and compliance this century'. The
introduction of self-assessment for the self-employed and the changeover
from taxation on a preceding-year basis to a current-year basis from the
1997-98 tax year, with a transitional year in 1996-97, will affect 9m people
in the UK.
Among those most affected will be partnerships. For partnerships in
existence on April 5 this year, taxable profits arising in any year of
assessment after April 5 1997 will be calculated as though the firm were an
individual, and then divided among the partners in the same way actual
profits are shared in the period in which they arise.
Partners will be required to include their share of the taxable profits in
their own personal tax returns for 1997-98 and calculate or 'self-assess'
the tax due on their total income and capital gains. Each partner will be
responsible for payment of his or her own tax. Tax returns must be filed
with the Inland Revenue by January 31 in the year following the year of
assessment.
Payments on account - tax paid before the final amount has been agreed with
the Inland Revenue - will be due in two instalments, the first on January 31
in the year of assessment and the second on July 31. Interim payments will
normally be based on the preceding year's tax liability. Final balancing
payments, like the tax return, must be made by January 31 in the year
following assessment.
Thus a firm with an accounting period ending on June 30 1998 will pay tax in
the financial year 1998-99 (the tax year in which its accounting period
ends), and partners will have to make interim payments on January 31 and
July 31 1999 and file completed returns and make balancing payments by
January 31 2000.
To encourage compliance and prompt payment, tax paid 28 days late, ie on
February 28, will attract a 5 per cent surcharge and, if it is still
outstanding six months later, another 5 per cent.
Although the new regime treats partners as sole traders, making each of them
responsible for his or her share of the profits, partnerships will still
submit returns of adjusted profits and the allocation of them among the
partners to the Revenue. Negotiations on the profits will also still be
handled centrally with the partnership.
To encourage compliance, late partnership returns will also attract an
automatic penalty of Pounds 100 per partner and a similar penalty if still
outstanding six months later. There are similar penalties for late personal
returns.
For partnerships in existence on April 5 this year, 1996-97 will be a
transitional year. Under the transitional provisions, tax paid in 1996-97
will be a 12 months' average of the tax payable on the profits arising in
the two years to April 5 1996.
Thus for a partnership with a year end of April 30, the relevant accounts on
which tax will be assessed for the transitional year 1996-97 will be for the
periods May 1 1994 to April 30 1995, and May 1 1995 to April 30 1996. Tax
will be payable on 12/24ths, or half, of those results.
According to Denise Catterall, a tax partner of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, this
creates a significant, one-off tax-planning opportunity for partnerships.
If a firm is anticipating any large or unusual items of income, it should
try to ensure payment is made during the transitional assessment period, as
it will effectively be halved for tax-averaging purposes. Equally, large
one-off items of expenditure, such as refurbishment or redundancy costs,
should be kept out of the assessment period, because a firm will effectively
get tax relief on only half.
With May 1 not far away, firms should be planning now to take advantage of
the transitional regime, either bringing forward exceptional items of
expenditure or delaying receipt of exceptional income, she says.
But there is one caveat. The Revenue has said it will introduce a narrowly
targeted anti-avoidance provision, details of which may not emerge until
next year, so caution is required.
Mrs Catterall believes that, provided firms stick to what can be classified
as ordinary commercial decisions, the Revenue will find it hard to object.
The trick, she says, will be to avoid anything that is too obviously
designed to cash in on the transitional regime.
The same is also true of partnership borrowings. If a firm has partnership
borrowings and is likely to pay an unusual amount of loan interest in the
transitional period, it will effectively only receive tax relief on half.
If, on the other hand, the borrowings are rearranged so that they are
expressed as loans to each partner individually, then full tax relief on the
interest will be available to partners as individuals.
Again, the Revenue may target this as an avoidance measure, but Mrs
Catterall believes it should be possible for firms to argue a commercial
justification for rearranging their finances.
The start of the transitional period is not far off, so it is vital that
partnerships clear their arrears with the Revenue if they are to avoid
problems in finalising their first partnership and personal returns under
the new system. For firms with a financial year ending March 31, the problem
is acute: once the new regime is in place, they will only have until the
following January 31 to file their returns and pay their tax.
Ten months is a short time for even the most efficient partnership to sort
out its tax system. If a firm is years behind in its tax affairs, as many
partnerships are, any tax return filed within such a tight timescale will
inevitably contain estimates.
With a period of only 12 months after the statutory filing in which
amendments can be made, partnerships may lose out if they do not take steps
quickly to ensure their tax affairs are up-to-date, to eliminate excessive
reliance on estimated figures.
Within certain limits, partnerships will be able to change their financial
year end, and the difficulty of filing returns within 10 months may be one
reason for moving the year end to a date after April 5. An April 30 year end
would give the firm considerably longer to file returns and statements of
profits. But against that must be balanced the effect of paying tax on
'overlap profits' - profits taxed in successive years for firms with year
ends straddling the fiscal year - and, in particular, the impact of this on
retiring and new partners.
Whatever the effect of the new rules on individual partnerships, the change
to a current-year basis of taxation will accelerate the payment of tax,
making tax provision more difficult - particularly in times of falling
profits.
Whereas a tax bill amassed and waiting to be paid could be used as working
capital under the old regime, under the new rules that 'fund' will no longer
be available, says Mrs Catterall.
She believes most partnerships will continue to provide for tax, but the
acceleration of the payment of tax may mean they will have to find other
means of raising working capital. Partners may be asked to contribute more,
or the deficit may be made up by billing earlier and chasing up payment.
These changes in personal taxation will have a significant impact on all
lawyers, architects, surveyors and other partnerships. For those who have
not yet taken proper advice, time is running out.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Business and the Law: Battle over drugs patent set for House
of Lords - Legal briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle between two pharmaceuticals companies over whether metabolites
produced by the body in response to drugs can be patented is set to go to
the House of Lords. This follows the UK Appeal Court's rejection of the
claim by Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, of the US, of an infringement of its
patent in the metabolite of terfenadine, an anti-histamine.
Merrell's original patent in terfenadine had expired, but the company
claimed that, by selling tablets containing the drug, Norton Healthcare of
the UK was providing the means for infringement of its subsequent patent in
the terfenadine metabolite, produced when terfenadine is taken. The Court
said that, if Merrell's argument was accepted, then 'if they discovered that
inside some organ of the human body aspirin invariably produces a hitherto
unsuspected compound, they could patent the compound and thereby preclude
anybody selling aspirin'.
The Court said Merrell's patent covering the terfenadine metabolite should
be revoked or amended so it did not apply to the metabolite when produced by
the human body.
The case is being watched by producers of generic drugs, which fear big
companies will use similar measures to prevent the sale of generic products.

FT  01 MAR 94 / People: 'Thinker rather than doer' needed at Fenner
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fenner, the Hull-based industrial group, is hoping to appoint a chief
executive by the end of April, filling the gap left by Julian Bigden, who
returned to the US in December after less than a year as managing director.
The appointment of a chief executive will be an important step for Fenner
after a year of senior management changes. Bigden had been appointed
managing director in February last year by Peter Barker, the former
executive chairman, and replaced Tom Brown who resigned unexpectedly.
But in May last year Barker himself announced his retirement. Colin Cooke
was appointed non-executive chairman in June and Bigden has now returned to
his previous job running Fenner's highly-successful US polymers operation -
a responsibility which he had retained when he moved to the UK.
His departure was said by Cooke to be 'very amicable', although it is
understood that Cooke was much happier with Bigden as a business manager
than as a managing director.
Cooke, who is also executive chairman at Triplex Lloyd, says Fenner has
three candidates in mind for the job of chief executive.
He is looking for a 'thinker rather than a doer' as chief executive, to
provide strategic leadership without interfering with the three main
divisional heads as they try to exploit growth opportunities.
Fenner is now being run on a day-to-day basis by Mark Abrahams, finance
director, and Michael Howell, a director of Arlington Capital Management who
joined Fenner's board in November.
A big challenge for the new chief executive will be to resolve the future of
Fenner's largest business, power transmission, which lost Pounds 1.8m in the
year ended September 30 and was largely responsible for a fall in overall
pre-tax profits from Pounds 11.3m to Pounds 9.6m.
Talks on a possible sale of the division broke down in December, and Fenner
is now concentrating on improving the unit's profitability.
This would make it more attractive to another purchaser.
However, it remains a relatively low-margin operation and lacks the growth
potential of Fenner's other specialist engineering businesses.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Business and the Law: Decision annulled and fine reduced -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Court of First Instance has again shown its teeth by annulling part of a
European Commission competition decision and substantially reducing a fine
imposed on one of the applicants.
The Commission decision concerned the Helsinki agreement - an agreement
between certain French financial institutions and the Eurocheque
organisation - which provided that traders affiliated to the Carte Bleue
and/or Eurocard networks would accept foreign Eurocheques on the same terms
imposed for payments by Carte Bleue and/or Eurocard cards.
Under the agreement, the French financial institutions agreed they would
charge traders which were affiliated to the relevant networks a commission
for purchases paid for by Eurocheque. The level of commission would be no
greater than that applicable to purchases paid for by CB, Visa or
Eurocard/Mastercard.
The Commission said the agreement infringed the EC competition rules and
imposed fines of Ecu1m and Ecu5m on the Eurocheque organisation and on the
French financial institutions group respectively. The parties sought
annulment of the decision or annulment of the fines.
The Eurocheque organisation's case turned on a procedural issue relating to
the rights of defence. Just before the Commission sent out its statement of
objections, setting out its preliminary findings on the Helsinki agreement,
the French financial institutions group notified the agreement to the
Commission.
In the light of this notification, the Commission addressed a supplementary
statement of objections to the French financial institutions group, but not
to the Eurocheque organisation on the grounds that Eurocheque had not
notified the agreement. A copy of the document was sent to Eurocheque for
information.
Eurocheque claimed the failure to address the supplementary statement of
objections to it breached its rights of defence, in that certain new
objections were raised in the supplementary document which it had not been
able to answer.
The Court said that, under the procedural rules governing such matters, it
was the Commission's duty to address statements of objections to all
interested parties, and that it could only retain in its final decisions
those objections which the parties had had an opportunity to address.
The Court said the supplementary statement of objections had modified the
intrinsic nature of the objections raised against Eurocheque. It also said
the Commission should not send to one party a copy of a statement of
objections addressed to another.
As a result of its findings, the Court annulled that part of the
Commission's decision relating to Eurocheque, including the fine.
The French financial institutions raised several points. The first was that
the Commission decision had failed to establish the existence of a
price-fixing agreement. The Commission had taken the position in its
decision that, not only did the Helsinki agreement set out rules for the
charging of commission on certain Eurocheque transactions, but that it also
regulated the amount of such charges. The Commission based this latter
conclusion on certain provisions in the Helsinki agreement.
But the Court said, although the Commission had been right to find that
there had been an agreement to charge commission on certain Eurocheque
transactions, it had been wrong to find that there has been an agreement on
the amount of commission.
The Court said the different provisions of the Helsinki agreement, which had
been read together by the Commission in support of its finding, in fact
related to two different types of transaction.
Given that the basis on which the Commission reached its finding was wrong,
the finding itself was invalid. Even though the French group's other
arguments were unsuccessful, the fine should be reduced accordingly. The
Court said the fine should be cut from Ecu5m to Ecu2m.

BP's energy division has grown rapidly in recent years, with turnover

FT  01 MAR 94 / People: Barnett moves to Y&amp;R
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Although the vaunted marriage between advertising agencies Gold Greenlees
Trott and Young &amp; Rubicam's London outpost has collapsed at the altar,
Bernard Barnett has decided to join the latter.
Barnett, elder statesman of London's advertising trade press, is
relinquishing his job at Campaign magazine and joining Y&amp;R in a capacity yet
to be determined.
Now 51, Barnett has done three stints at Campaign. Production editor from
1968-72, editor 1978-84, and editorial director since 1991, he's also that
rare bird, a practitioner of what he preaches; he worked for the Abbott Mead
Vickers and Ogilvy &amp; Mather agencies between 1984-91.
But given that London's advertising world is buzzing with gloom and doom
about Y&amp;R London - managing director Tim Lindsay and chief executive Jerry
Judge jumped ship just before Christmas - why has Barnett selected Y&amp;R for
his latest return foray?
Y&amp;R London 'is not in as good shape as it used to be', admits Barnett, but
adds 'there is an irresistible challenge in rebuilding a great brand.'

FT  01 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: A growing taste for shopping around -
Retailing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Single market enthusiasts have long maintained that retailing has a special
role to play in cementing the unity of the new Europe - and not just because
of the sector's role as distributor of manufactured goods. It employs about
17 per cent of the EU's workforce, and retail sales account for between 16.6
per cent of gross domestic product (in Belgium) and 35 per cent of GDP (in
Greece).
Yet retailing remains one of the least international industries, with many
leading retailers operating largely within their home markets. There are
fears that Europe's failure to develop powerful, truly international chains
means it will soon be overrun by new entrants from the US.
The fragmented nature of the European market results partly from cultural,
language and taste differences. But restrictive legislation has also
hindered domestic and cross-border expansion.
Laws such as France's Loi Royer, Belgium's Loi Cadenas, and Germany's
Baunutzungsverordnung limit retail developments above certain sizes. In the
Netherlands, the number of stores in any area is limited according to
population size. Those restrictions have not been removed by the single
market and, in some cases, differences are widening.
But it would be wrong to suggest that cross-border expansion in Europe is
not taking place. Between early 1991 and early 1993, the Oxford Institute of
Retail Management found European retailers had made 530 international moves,
nearly three-quarters of them expansions into other European countries. But
restrictive legislation and market saturation at home have also spurred
retailers to look at north America.
France's Promodes, Germany's Aldi and Tengelmann, Belgium's Delhaize, and
Ahold of the Netherlands all make at least 20 per cent of their turnover
outside their home markets. But chains from across the Atlantic are also
eyeing opportunities provided by a market of 320m west European consumers -
and are well-equipped to exploit them. Unimpeded by national boundaries,
planning restrictions, high land costs, and wars at home, some US retailers
have been building for a century or more.
The result is the world's largest, most vibrant retail market. At Dollars
2,000bn in 1992, it was larger than the GDP of united Germany. Their size
gives US retailers enormous buying power, while the competitiveness of the
market, plus the fact that experimental stores can be launched easily and
cheaply, has made the US the crucible of retailing innovation. The US
invented mail order, the self-service supermarket and TV shopping.
US retailing also has a highly-developed discount sector, and has pioneered
discount formats such as warehouse clubs, 'category killers' such as Toys R
Us and factory shop malls, which could pose a significant threat to
higher-margin European, and especially UK, retailers. A recent report by
retail research group Corporate Intelligence suggested more than 50 US
retail groups were queueing up to enter Europe, including the world's
largest, Wal-Mart.
There is, moreover, an important difference between US and European retail
expansion overseas. US retailers tend to export their own format and grow
organically. Groups such as Toys R Us and restaurant chain McDonald's have
brought innovative formulas to Europe and transformed every market they have
entered.
One reason may be that family ownership of retailers makes it difficult to
buy into the French, German and Dutch markets. But US retailers may in any
case be more adept at exploiting gaps in the market.
While some European retailers - such as Ikea, the Swedish furniture
superstore chain, Carrefour, the French food retailer, and smaller formats,
such as Benetton, Body Shop and Laura Ashley - have extensive overseas
networks of their own stores, most European retailers have preferred to
expand abroad through acquisitions. But they have not always proved adept at
transferring management skills to acquisitions, as shown by the roll call of
European companies, such as Marks and Spencer, Delhaize and Dixons, that
have had trouble in the US in recent years.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Cleaning up continental competitors -
Case Study, ISS / High-quality cleaning can be a pan-European business,
according to the Danish company that leads the world in this field
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With much of its work done in the hours of darkness, the cleaning business
occupies a twilight zone of the service industry. Yet providing sparkling
environments for offices, hospitals and industrial premises can offer
Europe-wide growth opportunities comparable to those in much higher-profile
sectors.
ISS, the Danish cleaning group which is the world's leader in this field,
has built up a European network of high-quality cleaners. Mr Waldemar
Schmidt, the 53-year-old managing director of ISS's European operations,
responsible for turnover of Pounds 330m a year, says: 'If other people can
have pan-European businesses, we asked ourselves, 'Why shouldn't this apply
to cleaning?' '
Cleaning is traditionally a fragmented, regional business, given scant
attention by customers. By offering high standards and encouraging companies
to take a cost-conscious look at their cleaning bills, ISS claims it can
lower overheads and promote efficiency.
ISS prides itself on higher wages and better training than most competitors.
'Cleaning is generally thought of as a job nobody wants to do,' says Mr Theo
Dilissen, managing director of Belgian operations. 'We offer incentives and
training courses so people can upgrade. Our workforce is our product. We're
helping our customers to become competitive.'
ISS's customers range from multinationals, such as IBM, Philips and
Monsanto, to the European Commission, and Vienna and Geneva airports.
Cleaning budgets can be surprisingly large. The annual cleaning costs of
Asea Brown Boveri, the international engineering group, exceed Dollars 75m.
'If you have an in-house cleaning team, it's not part of the core business,'
says Mr Schmidt. The key to better productivity, he says, is to bring in
quality-conscious outsiders, sometimes combining cleaning with other duties.
Under a recent contract with Slovenian railways, ISS is to have 300 cleaners
on the country's trains and stations, down from 600 previously. In an annual
Pounds 2m contract with British Airports Authority, 130 ISS cleaners work in
three shifts at Heathrow's Terminal One. They are encouraged not merely to
sweep floors but also to give directions to travellers.
ISS is developing additional services for its hospital customers, such as
catering, portering, technical maintenance and equipment supply.
With 130,000 employees in 20 countries, ISS is present in every main
European country apart from France and Italy. Its share of the cleaning
market is between 20 and 40 per cent in Scandinavia (where it is the market
leader), 6 per cent in the UK (where it is No 3) and 2 per cent in Germany
(No 8).
Mr Schmidt says expansion is customer-driven. He estimates annual growth
rates of the 'contracted out' cleaning market at 5 per cent in Austria,
Switzerland, Germany and France, 7 per cent in the UK, and 10 per cent in
Belgium and Greece. If ISS is right, more and more companies will be coming
round to the view that cleanliness and competitiveness belong together.
This is the fourth part of a 10-part series. Tomorrow: Technology.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Quest for a strategy to match Hollywood
 -The media
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Those struggling to create a strong European audio-visual industry face an
uncomfortable fact: across Europe, audiences still often prefer the
entertainment offered by Hollywood.
Even in France, where paranoia about US 'cultural imperialism' seems
rampant, consumers continue to vote with their feet at the box office.
Although the most popular film in France last year was Les Visiteurs, a
satire, it was one of only two French films to reach the top 10. In its
first 11 weeks, Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park sold 1.23m tickets in the
Paris region alone.
The US industry's dominance is based on the economies that flow from its
scale of production and the fact that costs can be recouped in the domestic
market before being exported. By comparison, Europe is fragmented by
language, tradition and differing attitudes to commercial broadcasting. Many
European countries have only recently developed commercial channels
alongside older public service broadcasters. In the past decade, for
instance, the number of commercial television channels in Europe has risen
from only four to more than 60 - though the number is likely to grow with
the launch of channels financed by advertising in eastern Europe.
In some major European markets, commercial production skills are still not
fully developed. Mr Manfred Lahnstein, president of the electronic media
division of Bertelsmann, the German media group, says the German television
industry still finds the production disciplines needed to turn out 30
minutes of a soap opera every day difficult. 'The advantage of the
Anglo-Saxon world is that they had private television so much earlier than
the continental Europeans,' he says.
Even so, German television has been changed profoundly by private
broadcasters such as RTL, in which Bertelsmann has a 39 per cent stake.
After 10 years in existence, RTL has finally taken a lead in the ratings
over both ARD and ZDF, the main German public networks. Yet many of the big
commercial broadcasters such as TF1, France's privatised first channel, CLT
of Luxembourg and Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest remain net importers of
programmes from the US.
Moreover, individual markets are at different stages of development in the
new media. Cable and satellite, are well established in the UK and Germany
but hardly at all in Italy. The pan-European market is still in its infancy,
although a growing number of satellite channels are broadcasting to a
continental market.
Varying strategies are being pursued by European governments and media
groups to compete more effectively with the Americans. Several governments,
such as France and the UK, are moving to reduce barriers preventing
broadcasting organisations becoming larger.
It is, however, hard to see this process producing more European media
groups on a world scale. There have been no television or film equivalents
so far of the merger of Reed International and Elsevier in the publishing
and information business.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Animal spirits on too tight a leash -
Services in Europe are less attuned to a mass market than in the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Europeans discuss industrial performance, most of the talk is about
manufacturing and little about services. Yet as the challenge of economic
regeneration grows more pressing, services' contribution and potential look
set to move sharply up the agenda.
The sector is already Europe's largest source of output and employment - and
its importance is increasing. In west Germany, Europe's leading
manufacturing economy, the number of services jobs rose 28 per cent from
1990 to 1992, while totals in other sectors stagnated or declined.
The outlook is for a continuing fall in factory jobs and a squeeze on public
sector payrolls throughout Europe, leaving services as one of few areas
where large-scale job creation still seems possible.
Optimists point to the US, where services employment has grown by 23m people
since 1980 - double the rise in the EU - and to the growth of Britain's
service economy. Though the quality of jobs created is disputed, these
examples are cited as arguments for relaxing continental Europe's rigid
labour laws.
But the story does not end there. The search for new jobs coincides
awkwardly with structural upheavals in services businesses such as
telecommunications, the media, financial services and retailing.
These businesses ought to be at the heart of wealth creation, as Europe
upgrades from declining traditional industries to newer, technology-based
activities involving higher skills and greater value-added. But, in many,
pressures to improve efficiency are likely in the short term to lead to
fewer jobs, not more.
A report last month for the European Commission found airlines' operating
costs were 48 per cent higher in Europe than in the US, largely because of
poorer labour productivity. A McKinsey study in 1992 found similar
transatlantic productivity differences in telecommunications and banking.
More recently, McKinsey found the efficiency of British retailers,
supposedly among Europe's highest, trailed far behind US chains. It
concluded that, if UK supermarkets had to charge US prices, they would
plunge into loss.
While most service businesses were labour-intensive and sheltered by
national barriers, such discrepancies mattered little. But the discrepancies
are becoming unsustainable as cross-border competition and labour-saving
technologies compel companies to raise productivity.
The pace is being forced by privatisation, which is challenging the
over-staffing, bureaucracy and obsolete practices encouraged by a tradition
of state ownership in sectors such as telecommunications, airlines and
banking. To judge by job cuts by privatised UK companies, the scope for
labour-shedding across Europe in the next few years is huge.
If services are to generate economically rewarding additional jobs, tackling
rigid labour laws will not be enough. Much will also depend on Europe's
ability to maximise market opportunities and stimulate service-based
businesses with the potential to grow fast and profitably.
On this score, services in Europe are bound by two constraints which impose
more heavily than on manufacturing. One is domination of important markets
by national monopolies. The other is a more complex - and often more
restrictive - panoply of regulatory control.
The impact of the EU's single market programme on these obstacles has been
uneven. Progress in dismantling barriers and encouraging cross-border
competition has been reasonably rapid in a range of financial, professional
and business services and road transport, but more halting in classic
monopoly industries, such as telecommunications, energy supply and air
transport. Nor does the programme tackle some inhibiting national
regulations, such as Germany's tight curbs on shopping hours.
But it is debatable how far fragmentation of Europe's services markets has,
in practice, obstructed their development. Though many barriers to market
entry have been real, others seem to owe much to participants' attitudes.
Among the most persuasive evidence is trans-European expansion by US
services producers. While Europe's broadcasters and film makers dabble with
collaboration, Hollywood entertainment dominates its screens. The US-owned
MTV music channel, now beamed Europe-wide, has pioneered an entirely new
market.
US telecommunications and cable operators have been more aggressive than
most local counterparts in establishing footholds in Europe, while the
running in 'multi-media' services, such as home shopping, is mostly by US
firms. Most packaged software used on personal computers in Europe is of US
origin, while Japanese groups dominate electronic video games.
Chains such as Toys R Us and Computerland have revolutionised sectors of
European retailing, while McDonald's is now France's biggest restaurateur
and has earmarked western Europe as its prime growth market in the 1990s.
US companies obviously benefit from scale economies from a large and
homogenous home market. But, in most cases, they also succeed in Europe by
offering distinctive products, backed by effective marketing and
distribution.
European services companies such as Ikea or Benetton in retailing, which
have made an impact in North America by transplanting a new idea, are more
rare. More often the preferred route is to buy market share by investing in
established businesses.
Though this approach is supposed to reduce risk, the results have been
mixed. Grand Metropolitan has revitalised Burger King, but Bass is still
struggling to turn around Holiday Inn. Marks &amp; Spencer now admits it paid
too much for Brooks Brothers, the US clothing chain, while several European
grocery groups which bought into US supermarkets have been troubled by the
experience.
Of course, US service companies are far from infallible, as the Eurodisney
fiasco demonstrates. But, at their best, they often seem more closely
attuned than European businesses to the mass market and more confident about
exporting innovations.
That suggests that, if Europe's services industries are to prosper, ridding
markets of artificial barriers and excessive regulation is only half the
battle. The bigger challenge may be to unleash the animal spirits needed to
exploit them fully against steadily stiffer international competition.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Regional expertise in niche markets -
Business services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business services such as telecommunications, air transport and accountancy
are not only large sectors in their own right: their performance also
strongly influences the success of the economy as a whole.
Unfortunately, Europe's performance in many business services leaves much to
be desired. Compared to the US, productivity is often poor, markets are
shrivelled and services are expensive.
A services study by McKinsey, the management consultants, in 1992 concluded:
'US industries generally continue to show a higher level of productivity
than their European counterparts.' As a result, Europe does not have as
large a presence as the US in what are often high value-added businesses,
and other industries reliant on business services suffer from high costs and
poor quality.
But the picture is not all gloom. Europe, notably the UK, does quite well in
accountancy, law and management consultancy. Britain's leading law firms are
the main competitors for US firms in the growing market for international
legal services. The 'Big Six' global accountancy firms still have strong UK
roots.
An important explanation is that London's highly developed financial markets
have proved demanding customers for accountants and international lawyers.
Not only has this meant a high standard has been required of them but it has
also enabled them to win business abroad by hanging on to financiers'
coat-tails.
Europe usually does well in business services needing a high degree of
customisation as opposed to mass-market solutions. A history of
fragmentation seems to have given the region's businessmen an expertise in
niche markets.
For example, Europe's computer services industry performs well in designing
'bespoke' software - tailor-made solutions for individual companies. By
contrast, the market for 'packaged software' is dominated by the US. It
supplied 78 per cent of the world market in 1991, with European production
accounting for only 16 per cent.
Europe's tradition of monopoly and state-ownership has contributed to its
lack of dynamism in sectors such as telecommunications and air transport.
Fragmentation of these industries on national lines has also prevented the
development of high-quality cross-border networks.
The consequences in telecommunications are quite high prices for basic phone
services, especially cross-border calls. There has also been a low take-up
of more advanced products, such as freephone services, while Europe is
behind in developing 'electronic superhighways' which could revolutionise
distribution arrangements for many industries.
In airlines, the picture is similar. A recent report for the European
Commission showed Europe suffers from quite high airline operating costs and
antiquated air traffic control systems. High fares and delayed flights not
only harm business travellers and undermine development of a single market:
they also undermine the competitive advantage of the EU's travel and tourism
industries, which employ 19m people.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Hard times after death of king coal: The fate of NUM
officials 10 years after the great strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ten years ago today Mr George Hayes, the National Coal Board's area director
for South Yorkshire, announced the closure of Cortonwood colliery,
triggering one of the largest national strikes in British industrial
history: the 1984-85 miners' strike.
Since the strike, the number of miners has fallen from 196,000 to about
14,000 with political and industrial consequences which have been well
charted.
What has happened to the local officials of the National Union of
Mineworkers? Those men - usually articulate and self-confident - formed a
unique labour movement elite at the heart of the mining communities.
As the pits have closed it is those men who have had furthest to fall,
losing not only a well-paid job but social status. Many now struggle to earn
a living as security guards, school caretakers, or taxi drivers and look
back nostalgically on the days when they were, in effect, managing the
working lives of hundreds of people.
Few have changed their views about the strike. Mr Alan Cummings, 46, a
senior official at Easington colliery, County Durham, still feels there was
a political vendetta against the strike and remains bitter about the lack of
support from the rest of the labour movement. Others, such as Mr Carl
Browning, lodge secretary at Celynen South in south Wales, blame Mr Arthur
Scargill for mishandling the dispute. Mr Cummings' pit only closed last
year, since when he has been winding up union business and is only next
month set to join the dole queue. Looking back, he says: 'The fact is we
were thrashed. It wasn't just 10-0 it was 100-0.'
He does not expect to be able to exploit his considerable experience of
managing people or even to find a job on the Peterlee industrial estate.
Instead he is thinking of returning to college.
A fellow official at Easington, Mr John MacManey, has found a job doing
unskilled work in a local factory packing batteries. Hardest to take is the
close supervision. 'Down a mine you have to be able to trust people to get
on with the job, but in factories they treat you like a moron,' he says.
Mr Mick Appleyard, 50, former secretary at Sharlston colliery in West
Yorkshire, suffers from arthritis and lives a lonely life on disability
benefit, seeing old comrades from the Yorkshire NUM circuit rarely.
Another official from Sharlston, Mr John Swithenbank, like many former
miners works as a security guard on half the pay he got as a miner. He works
for the Reliance security company on 12-hour shifts - three on days, three
on nights, and then three days off.
Mr Jim Heel, former NUM treasurer at Celynen South, survives as a
small-business owner. His wife's hardware retail business has expanded since
the pit closed and they run three shops.
Mr Carl Browning, the Celynen South secretary, works as a caretaker in a
local school, and has taken a large drop in earnings. He has remained
politically involved, however, and sits as a magistrate.
Sometimes miners take their strong union traditions into their new jobs. Mr
Frank Clarke, former secretary at South Kirkby colliery, got a job at the
Morrison supermarket in Wakefield and blew new life into the local TGWU
general union branch. But it has not been easy for Mr Clarke. As an NUM
official he was on full-time union business. As a TGWU representative at
Morrison's he has to do union work in his spare time after a 50-hour week
for little more than Pounds 150.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Cash supply figures boost for Clarke
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp rise in the purchasing managers' index and newly published money
supply figures point to the continuing health of the UK recovery after a
raft of sluggish economic statistics in recent weeks.
The news should cheer Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, as he prepares for
tomorrow's monthly monetary meeting with Mr Eddie George, governor of the
Bank of England.
Figures released by the Bank yesterday show that M0, the narrowest measure
of the money supply, grew by a seasonally adjusted 0.9 per cent in February,
for an annual rate of 5.5 per cent, up from 5.3 per cent in January. The
rise was ahead of market expect-ations.
This jump was partly caused by a sharp rise in the erratic component of M0,
banks' deposits at the Bank of England. Notes and coins, the main component
of M0, grew by a more modest 0.5 per cent in February (also seasonally
adjusted), for a 12 month growth rate of 5.6 per cent, down from 5.7 per
cent in January.
The government's monitoring range for M0 is 0 per cent to 4 per cent, but
the measure has been outside this band for some time. M0's annualised rate
of growth over the three months to February was 9.3 per cent.
However, the government has argued that fast M0 growth has been caused by
the fall in interest rates.
The opportunity cost of holding cash - instead of putting it in the bank and
earning interest - has fallen and therefore people's willingness to hold
cash has risen. In technical jargon, the velocity of money has fallen (it
circulates less quickly).
Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities, said that, adjusted
for the Treasury's measure of velocity, M0 was within its monitoring range.
Previous interest rate cuts occurred, he said, when M0 was with-in its
adjusted monitoring range.
The Purchasing Managers Index, released today, indicates a significant
increase of activity in February. The index, compiled by the Chartered
Institute of Purchasing and Supply, rose to 55.5 per cent in February, its
highest level since last April.
The index is based on a weighted survey of variables, such as measures of
output and new orders. Any level above 50 per cent represents an increase
over the previous month. January's index, which was 49.1, pointed to a
new-year lull in activity.
The institute said that output and new orders were particularly strong in
February, reflecting 'a general improvement in economic conditions
throughout all regions and manufacturing sectors during the month'.

Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, last night said government should act as
a catalyst to unleash 'volunteer power'.
Giving the St Stephen's Club Disraeli Lecture in London he said ministers
should try to tap the efforts of business and individuals before giving

FT  01 MAR 94 / Two-thirds back unitary councils
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two-thirds of people questioned by MORI, the pollsters, for the Local
Government Commission approve in principle of a unitary system of local
government.
The findings were released yesterday by the Association of District
Councils, which claimed that the polls showed that people wanted 'change,
not the status quo'.
But support for removing a tier of government was strongest in areas such as
Bristol and Cleveland where new counties were set up in 1974. The poll did
not present local people with detailed proposals for possible unitary
councils, and showed that in most areas only half of residents identified
strongly with their district or county council.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Roger Levitt, disgraced former chairman of the Levitt Group which
collapsed owing Pounds 34m, is the first person to be indefinitely banned
from the investment business in the UK, Norma Cohen writes.
The Securities and Investments Board said yesterday that, for the first
time, it had exercised its powers under section 59 of the Financial Services
Act.
SIB said its powers under the act did not actually allow it to publicise the
names of individuals who are banned but anyone reading the register, kept
under section 102 of the act, would be able to keep track of such actions.
Mr Levitt was convicted of deceiving Fimbra, the self-regulating body, about
the financial condition of his company and was sentenced to 180 hours of
community service.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Calor enters natural gas market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Calor Gas, the dominant supplier of bottled liquefied petroleum gas in the
UK, has decided to enter the increasingly competitive natural gas market.
Mr Howard Robinson, chief executive, said Calor Gas would offer supplies
immediately to consumers using more than 2,500 therms a year, with
particular emphasis on small commercial users.
Mr Robinson said many British Gas consumers in that category had yet to see
the benefits from a competitive market, in part because they have been
overlooked by existing independent gas companies.
Calor has hired Sir James McKinnon, former head of Ofgas, the industry
regulator, to advise its natural gas business.
It will be supplied by Alliance Gas, the joint venture of British Petroleum,
Statoil and Norsk Hydro of Norway. Alliance, which is one of the larger
independents to emerge since the government began to liberalise the gas
market, says it has 10 per cent of the firm market for gas users above 2,500
therms.
The independents have captured 41 per cent of the total market above 2,500
therms. Calor says it might be able to attract 5 per cent to 10 per cent of
the 300,000 or so potential customers in the small commercial category. It
claims to be able to offer price savings of up to 15 per cent compared with
current British Gas charges.
A multi-year gas supply contract is the only formal link between the two
companies. Alliance will be able to enter into similar arrangements with
other companies, and it will remain free to sell to the same category of
consumers that Calor is aiming at.
But Alliance executives think any duplication of efforts will be limited.
They point out that their company does not have the staff to identify and
approach many of the smaller commercial users, whereas Calor has a national
sales and dealer network.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Mortgage lending by big banks falls 25% in month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mortgage lending by leading British banks fell by more than a quarter in
January compared with the month before.
Gross loans were Pounds 1.01bn, down from Pounds 1.36bn, according to
yesterday's figures from the British Bankers' Association. This was the
seventh successive monthly fall since the Pounds 1.72bn gross figure of June
last year.
Seasonally adjusted figures for net lending also dropped, from Pounds 733m
in December to Pounds 588m in January.
Mortgage approvals also continued to fall - to 19,297 approvals with a value
of Pounds 914m, after December figures of 20,348 with a value of Pounds
968m.
Approvals are seen as an important indicator of the state of the mortgage
market, so the fall of slightly more than 5 per cent is less discouraging
for the banks than December's sharper drop, which was reflected in January's
lower mortgage lending figures.
Mr John Ecklin, BBA statistics director, said yesterday that he expected the
leading banks' share of the UK mortgage market in January to be about 33 per
cent, compared with more than 35 per cent during 1993. This suggests that
building societies have begun to regain some ground.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Howard retreats over police bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, has been forced into a humiliating
climbdown in the face of determined Lords opposition to his plans to
increase Home Office control of police authorities.
The climbdown will be announced in the Lords today by Earl Ferrers, Home
Office minister of state, when debate resumes on the police and magistrates
courts bill.
Earl Ferrers will tell peers that Mr Howard has given way to demands by
backbench Conservatives, backed by Labour and the Liberal Democrats, for
local control of police authority membership.
Mr Howard intended to take powers to appoint five of the 16 members of
reformed police authorities, including the chairman, which would have given
unelected Home Office nominees and magistrates an inbuilt majority over
local authority representatives.
The proposals would have changed the character of police authorities, which
at present are two-thirds local councillors and one-third magistrates.
The government began to back down after the bill was savaged during its
second reading debate by Conservative peers led by Lord Whitelaw, former
deputy prime minister.
Compromise proposals that would have distanced the home secretary from the
selection of nominated members and allowed authorities to pick their own
chairman were dropped after a second backbench rebellion by Tory peers.
Earl Ferrers will tell the Lords that the government now accepts that local
authority representatives should always have a majority over magistrates and
the home secretary's nominees.
He will say that most police authorities will have nine councillors,
compared with five Home Office nominees and three magistrates. A few
authorities will be larger, but the proportions will be similar.
The Home Office nominees will be chosen from a list produced by selection
panels consisting of three groups: equal numbers of members chosen centrally
by the home secretary, and locally by councillors and magistrates; and a
separate delegation chosen jointly by the first two groups.
The extent of the climbdown reflects Mr Howard's fear that the bill would be
rejected by the Lords, which would have forced ministers to rely on a small
Commons majority.

FT  01 MAR 94 / 'Buns not guns' company calls in receivers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A gateau-making company that was at the centre of a 'buns not guns'
relocation controversy has gone into receivership, less than a year after
opening.
The Pounds 7m investment at Preston Farm, Stockton-on-Tees, by Livera Foods
was announced in a written Commons reply two years ago by Mr Michael
Portillo, then inner-cities minister. He linked it to the government's
announcement the same day that a planned Ministry of Defence relocation to
Preston Farm had been abandoned.
The Commons announcement of the plant produced mixed feelings in Teesside,
with critics comparing its jobs unfavourably with the 1,600 jobs the
relocation of the MoD's Quality Assurance Unit would have brought.
Mr Portillo said the gateau plant was expected to create up to 700 jobs,
plus 100 in supplier companies. Its founder, Mr Chris Liveras, who opened
the factory last March, announced in September he was increasing the
workforce by 250 to 600 because of 'phenomenal growth' in orders.
Yesterday receivers Arthur Andersen said they had been called in late on
Friday at the request of the banks, with Livera Foods' consent. Mr Alan
Katz, joint receiver, said: 'The company has had demand and production
difficulties for some time and this had had a cumulative effect.'
The receivers said the company, which had a turnover of about Pounds 6m and
supplied supermarkets and the food retail trade, employed 300 staff. Of
these, 140 who had been laid off were yesterday made redundant; the other
160 were laid off yesterday but have been asked to return tomorrow.
Mr Katz said the support of its customers and suppliers was being sought in
the hope of keeping the company trading and selling it as a going concern.
Several parties were already interested.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Curb on baby milk adverts attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manufacturers of formula milk for babies yesterday attacked government
proposals to ban consumer advertising of the product as a 'scandal' which
would result in tougher laws than for tobacco.
The government finishes consulting on the proposed rules at the end of this
week and plans to have regulations in place by June. Health officials want
to see an increase in breastfeeding, which is considered better for babies.
The changes also follow a European Union directive.
Manufacturers in the UK are allowed to advertise to the retail trade, health
professionals and mothers through promotional literature distributed by
health workers. The new rules would allow advertising to health
professionals only, and would be much stricter than the requirements of the
EU directive.
The Infant and Dietetic Foods Association, which represents the main baby
milk manufacturers including Wyeth, Cow &amp; Gate and Milupa, said the milks
were 'a perfectly legal food but they are attempting to impose more
restrictions on us than on tobacco'.
The Advertising Association, which represents advertisers, said yesterday
that the ban was 'illogical, inappropriate and unnecessary'.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Names deal more likely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes rose yesterday for an out-of-court settlement in a legal action
involving 366 lossmaking Lloyd's Names - individuals whose assets support
the insurance market.
The Names, members of Pulbrook syndicate 334, face losses of more than
Pounds 44m on business underwritten in 1985. Their case, which began in the
High Court last week, is the first of more than two dozen planned by
lossmakers scheduled to come to court over the next few years.
Most of the lossmakers blame negligence by their agents for losses of more
than Pounds 3bn.
An offer to the Pulbrook Names - which is understood to be under
consideration - would need be to more attractive to the Names than the
Pounds 2.5m offered them as part of Lloyd's overall settlement package,
rejected last month.
One possibility is that the money could be used to buy a reinsurance policy
allowing the Names to cap losses that have still to emerge on syndicate 334.
Chatset, the company which monitors Lloyd's, estimates that syndicate 334's
losses could ultimately exceed Pounds 100m. According to one estimate, a
policy to reinsure such liabilities could cost between Pounds 21m and Pounds
27m.
Separately, it is understood that the House of Lords has agreed to hear an
appeal in a case by Lloyd's agents on a preliminary issue affecting dozens
of cases at the market: the liability of members' agents - who handle the
affairs of Names - for the alleged defaults of managing agents who
administer syndicates.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Dozen MPs rapped for flouting financial disclosure rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, and Mr Richard Needham, trade minister,
are among 12 MPs who were yesterday criticised by a Commons all-party report
for failing to comply with new rules governing disclosure of financial
dealings.
The MPs, all members of Lloyd's insurance market, have been urged by the
Commons committee of members' interests - which published the new register
of members' interests - to 'comply without further delay'.
Another 11 MPs, including Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, failed
to re-register their interests in time for the latest edition. The committee
'regretted' that so many failed to meet the deadline.
Referring to MPs who had not complied with the new requirements, the
committee said: 'Some have refused outright, making clear that they regard
the new rule as an unwarranted invasion of privacy which will be abused by
the media.
'Several other members, while complying with the new rule, have made clear
that they are doing so under protest.'
Ms Angela Eagle, Labour MP for Wallasey and a member of the committee, said
the Lloyd's Names who failed to supply their syndicate numbers were
challenging the House.
'It is extremely dubious to allow individual members to flout resolutions of
the House. That can't be allowed to continue,' she said.
She has called for a meeting between the chairman of the select committee
and the Speaker at the 'earliest possible opportunity' to decide what action
could be taken to put pressure on members failing to declare their syndicate
numbers.
In the Commons Mr Bob Cryer, Labour MP for Bradford South and another
committee member, accused the 12 of a 'concerted and co-ordinated attempt to
refuse to provide information'.
Mr Hunt said he would reveal his Lloyd's syndicate numbers when he had
finalised his underwriting arrangements for the coming year.
The register is the first public document to reveal which syndicates include
MPs. It does not, however, provide details of how much capacity the MPs
provide to each of their syndicates, nor of their stop-loss insurance - a
personal reinsurance policy which limits possible loss.

FT  01 MAR 94 / The Personal Pensions Time Bomb: Slow response by regulators
is exposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The study exposing widespread disregard of rules in the sale of pensions to
people transferring out of occupational schemes poses as big a problem for
the financial services watchdogs as it does for the industry they regulate.
The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulator, is adamant
that the standards used for the pilot study it commissioned from accountants
KPMG Peat Marwick should have been in force from the first sale of a pension
transfer in 1988.
The question must be why the regulators did not spot at the time such
routine failures to comply with the standards they demanded - why the
watchdogs did not bark sooner.
It was not until summer 1992 that Lautro, the self-regulating organisation
for the life insurance industry, and Fimbra, the self-regulating body for
independent financial advisers, followed by SIB itself, published guidance
to members stating the information that sales staff needed to carry out
pension transfer business properly.
Even allowing some months to prepare and agree the guidance, that suggests
that no serious and widespread failure to meet regulators' requirements
became apparent until late 1991.
Among the main factors regulators cite to explain the time-lag is that this
new area of business was opened while the regulatory framework was still
being developed.
While the Financial Services Act system of regulation was intended to be
tougher than what had preceded it, the new regulators were not at their most
effective from the start.
One regulator involved in the process said that although the numbers
pensions sold in 1988 and 1989 were relatively low 'there was far less
compliance in the early years'. Another said: 'Regulators were not well
equipped for the speed of growth in this business.'
Mr Kit Jebens, chief executive of Lautro, recalled the early tone of
regulation. He said: 'When I joined, the brief I got from the then chief
executive was that the industry consisted of good guys with a great deal of
integrity - all we need to do is to produce a set of rules.'
As important, say regulators, was the political climate of the late 1980s.
Driven by the government, this encouraged the growth of personal pensions.
The complexity of pension transfers meant problems were often difficult to
reveal in routine inspections. According to one of those involved, SIB
realised the extent of non-compliance only last year, after it started
sending a pensions expert out on inspection visits.
The long-term nature of pensions business meant that it did not attract many
early complaints from customers who felt that they had not had a good deal.
Mr Richard Cockcroft, Fimbra practice director, said one of the first
signals of the extent of the problem was a cluster of letters from leading
pension-scheme administrators in early 1992, saying individuals appeared to
be transferring on what seemed to be bad advice.
As one senior regulator admits: 'You could say that the regulators were slow
to get to grips with it.'

FT  01 MAR 94 / OFT to investigate warranties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Office of Fair Trading is to investigate the sale of extended warranties
by retailers, after allegations that consumers are paying too much.
The warranties provide protection on products - commonly electrical goods -
after one-year guarantees have expired. The OFT was asked to carry out
preliminary research into warranties sales in January by Mr Neil Hamilton,
corporate affairs minister.
Mr Hamilton's decision came in response to a written question from Labour's
consumer affairs spokesman Mr Nigel Griffiths, who claimed some retailers
were selling extended warranties for more than twice what manufacturers
charged.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said yesterday that
his inquiries had revealed a 'wide range of prices for extended warranties
on the same goods coupled with a lack of information about the choice of
cover available to consumers'.
The OFT would be consulting retailers, manufacturers and consumer groups to
consider whether greater 'transparency' was needed in the market, and how to
attain it.
The investigation may have important implications for electrical retailers,
particularly the market leaders Dixons, which also owns the Currys chain,
and Comet, part of the Kingfisher group.
Sales of warranties are thought to account for less than 10 per cent of
Dixons' sales, but some analysts believe they account for a large part of
the group's operating profits.
About a third of customers take out extended warranties.
Mr Griffiths claims that the electrical retailers, by failing to tell their
customers that cheaper alternatives are available, are 'profiteering at
their customers' expense'.
Retailers claim their warranties cost more because they cover all parts and
labour, as well as accidental damage, while manufacturers' warranties often
cover only failure of parts.
Retailers can also exchange products immediately with new ones if they are
not repairable, or replace them with another manufacturer's product.
The Radio, Electrical and Television Retailers' Association said it believed
the majority of retailers' warranties offered 'good value for money'.

FT  01 MAR 94 / The Personal Pensions Time Bomb: SIB to issue information on
perils of opting out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Securities and Investments Board will this month take action to ensure
that people considering buying a personal pension instead of remaining in
their employer's or former employer's occupational scheme are aware of the
pitfalls.
This follows the City watchdog's publication last December of a pilot study
which suggested widespread failure among sales agents to comply with
regulators' standards and raised public concern about the mis-selling of
personal pensions. SIB said in an interim statement yesterday on its
progress in handling pension transfers and opt-outs, that a full report on
ensuring high standards in future business would be published after it had
been considered by SIB's board in mid-March.
The focus of this month's report is likely to be on ensuring that sales
agents properly explain the possible pension sale to customers, and on
strengthening the monitoring and control arrangements in companies and among
regulators.
There will also be a fact-sheet or checklist, intended to advise people what
issues they should raise with sales agents when discussing pension
transfers. It is likely to emphasise that most people in an occupational
scheme run by their current employer should probably not leave.
SIB's statement came as Labour MPs seized on the report in yesterday's
Financial Times to question Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary,
about the costs to the taxpayer of the growth in personal pensions. Mr
Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, asked whether the FT
investigation did not reveal 'an atmosphere of scandal' surrounding the
industry.
Mr Lilley vigorously defended the development of the private pensions
market. He said: 'If we didn't have the opportunity for people to opt for
private pensions where their firm has occupational pensions, many of those
40 per cent who are making greater provision than if they had stayed in
Serps would not have done so.'
SIB used yesterday's announcement to set out the planned timetable for work
on pension transfers.
By the end of April the self-regulating organisations such as Lautro, for
the life insurance industry, and Fimbra, for independent financial advisers,
must tell their members which categories of pension transfers they should
reconsider as a priority. The categories might include people coming up to
retirement, or those who have transferred out of a scheme with index-linked
benefits.
By the end of July the regulators will publish guidelines for companies and
regulators on compensation for people who received poor advice. There will
be advice for individual investors about how to respond and, if necessary,
how to complain.

FT  01 MAR 94 / The Personal Pensions Time Bomb: Legal &amp; General probes
alleged breach of rules - Peter Marsh on claims that illicit payments were
offered by sales agents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Legal &amp; General, the insurance company, is investigating allegations that an
employee of one of its sales agents offered money to former mineworkers in
an effort to arrange contacts with prospective clients.
The allegations concern Mr Jack Parry, an employee of Surebond, a 24-person
company based in Brampton near Rotherham, South Yorkshire, which sells
pensions and other investment products on L&amp;G's behalf.
The allegations are denied by both Mr Parry and Surebond. If substantiated
they could mean L&amp;G facing a public rebuke from Lautro, the insurance
industry watchdog, or a fine for failing to control Surebond's activities.
If the allegations were proved they would mean Surebond had breached
industry guidelines which prohibit pension-industry employees from offering
cash inducements to other people for lining up possible sales.
Mr John Church and Mr Dave Nixon, two former mineworkers who are both NUM
mining union officials, told the FT that Mr Parry offered them cash to
provide the names of other NUM members who might be interested in switching
out of the British Coal pension scheme into personal pensions.
Mr Church and Mr Nixon said the offers had been made on two occasions in the
NUM offices at Bentley and Hatfield collieries, where the two men were NUM
branch secretaries. At both sets of discussions, which took place around the
time of the closure of the two pits in November, only the NUM official and
Mr Parry were present.
It is alleged that in both cases the offer was Pounds 50 for an initial
contact, followed by Pounds 50 for a formal exchange of pension papers
between Surebond and British Coal and a further Pounds 50 if the miner
formally switched pensions.
The affair underlines controversy about sales methods used by some insurance
and pension companies in the Yorkshire region, where 12,000 miners have been
made redundant in the past two years.
British Coal said the region had been blitzed by the pensions companies,
seeking out redundant mineworkers who might wish to transfer their pensions
into private schemes. It said questionable advice had been given in some
cases.
In the past two years an estimated 6,000 former miners from the Yorkshire
region have switched out of the British Coal scheme for personal pensions,
most of them soon after losing their jobs. The value of these transfers is
estimated at Pounds 150m.
Mr Parry, a former miner, has worked for Surebond for a year, based in rooms
rented in a disused school. His job is to introduce possible clients to the
company's sales staff.
He said he had talked to NUM officials at Bentley and Hatfield but had not
offered money. The allegations were 'a downright lie'. Mr Peter Kettell,
Surebond managing director, said: 'There is no way Jack would offer money.
Lautro would hit the roof if they thought we were making inducements.'
In a letter to the FT asking it to pass on details, L&amp;G said it had started
an investigation into the allegations. Lautro also said it would be studying
the affair.
Nine of the 10 NUM branch secretaries at the Yorkshire pits that closed have
told the FT that pension companies offered them either money or jobs for
handing over lists of names.
In many cases the job offers were linked to the NUM officials using contacts
among former mineworkers to find people interested in leaving the British
Coal pension scheme for private pensions.
The facts in most of these cases are difficult to substantiate, but
interviews suggest that other pensions groups may have tried to target NUM
officials as a way to arrange contacts with former miners.
Mr Kev Coates, NUM branch secretary at Markham Main near Doncaster, South
Yorkshire, which closed last year, said he received a phone call from
someone claiming to be an agent working for the Leeds office of Allied
Dunbar, the insurance company. He said the man, who gave his name as
Jonathan, offered him Pounds 1,500 for the names and addresses of the 700
NUM members at the mine.
Allied Dunbar said it could not trace anyone at the Leeds office who had
made the call. An approach of this kind would be 'irregular'.
Mr Steve Tulley, NUM branch secretary at Frickley colliery, which closed in
November, said two men who said they were from the Pearl insurance company
visited his house twice to talk about a job. This was on the basis that he
could use his contacts to sell pensions and other investment products.
Pearl said it could find no evidence of these visits. If the story could be
substantiated Pearl would 'take a serious view as this isn't the way the
company operates'.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Salmon dumping row goes to EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish salmon producers have stepped up their action against Norway. They
have made a formal complaint to the European Commission alleging that the
Norwegian salmon industry has been dumping its fish on the European Union
market.
The complaint comes five months after European salmon prices collapsed after
an unexpected surge in output by Norway, the dominant European producer.
Scottish salmon farmers say Norway's higher production is made possible only
by heavy government subsidies and financial support for the banking system
which lends to the farmers. It wants the European Commission to investigate
whether Norwegian farmers are selling fish below the cost of production and,
if this dumping claim is sustained, take action against Norway.
That could entail countervailing import duties, or asking Norway to bring
supply and demand into balance by taking fish off the EU market.
The complaint by the Scottish Salmon Growers Association comes at a delicate
moment, just as the EU is supposed to conclude negotiations with Norway,
Sweden, Finland and Austria on their terms of entry to the EU. The UK
government has irritated salmon farmers by showing itself keener to secure
Norwegian membership of the EU than to take action on the farmers' behalf.
To support its dumping claim the association commissioned a report from
accountants Ernst &amp; Young which showed that Norway's high level of salmon
production at low prices could not have been achieved without direct grants
and subsidies to producers amounting to 20 per cent of the cost of
production over the past five years. It said losses by the Norwegian
industry in these years had mostly been absorbed by the four leading banks,
which have been in government control since 1991.
Mainly because of a surge in Norway's production, helped by breakthroughs in
treatment of disease, salmon prices in the EU collapsed last October.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Road deals worth Pounds 1bn announced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Work is due to start on 22 new motorway and trunk-road contracts worth more
than Pounds 1bn in 1994-95, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary,
announced yesterday, Charles Batchelor writes.
The British Road Federation, which represents companies using roads, said
this was fewer than half the number of schemes that the government had
planned to carry out. It said that before cuts in the roads budget the
Department of Transport had hoped to start 47 schemes worth Pounds 1.71bn.
The government has drawn up a reserve list of seven projects which could
start if any of the 22 projects is delayed.
More than 50 construction contracts are already under way and more than
Pounds 500m will be spent on maintenance next year. Estimated spending on
new building will be about Pounds 1.3bn in 1994-95.
Among new contracts planned for next year are bypasses of Derby, Bedford,
Widnes and Newbury. Sections of the M1, M5, M25 and M40 motorways will be
widened.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Move on disabled at work dropped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has backed down on controversial plans to make employers
contribute up to 50 per cent of the cost of special measures for disabled
employees.
The proposal, by Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, has been deferred
for one year following representations from bodies including the Royal
National Institute for the Blind. Such charities had warned that the
measures would discourage the employment of disabled people.
The revised scheme, called Access to Work, was formally launched yesterday
by Mr Hunt. It will fund such measures as adaptations to premises, fares to
work and the reader service for blind people.
The announcement coincided with the publication of a study by the National
Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux which said that tougher measures were
needed to protect the growing numbers of people who face discrimination at
work and when looking for jobs.
The bureaux said inadequate legislation, coupled with diminishing job
security and a steady stripping away of workers' rights, had given employers
increased freedom to act on prejudice making it harder for groups including
disabled people and ethnic minorities to get work.
The new help for disabled people, announced by Mr Hunt, includes
communication support for deaf people and adaptation of vehicles to get
individuals to work. A cap of Pounds 21,000 has been put on the amount of
help any individual can be given over five years.
Mr Hunt said he was challenging the Employment Service to place more
unemployed disabled people into work this year than last.
His original plan had been for employers to make a 50 per cent contribution
towards assistance for disabled employ-ees who had worked for them for six
months or more.
Ms Ann Clwyd, shadow employment minister, welcomed the government's decision
not to introduce what she called a levy on employers.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Customs to fight EU duty challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Customs and Excise said yesterday that it would fight any attempt by the
European Commission to overturn UK excise rules and allow British consumers
to order cheap alcoholic drinks and tobacco from across the Channel by
phone.
Since the advent of the single European market last year, UK shoppers have
been able to bring back as much alcohol and tobacco as they want from EU
countries for personal use - within certain generous guidelines - without
paying UK excise duty. But anyone buying and transporting goods on behalf of
someone else still has to pay excise.
The European Commission plans to challenge that rule, saying that, provided
duty is paid in the country of purchase, imports do not have to be
transported by the buyer in person to avoid excise.
That would allow UK customers to place orders for alcohol or cigarettes with
commercial couriers or mail order operators, which would transport goods on
their behalf.
'The commission's opinion is that if you pay for the transport of the goods
it's as if you were transporting them,' the commission said yesterday. It is
expected to make a proposal in May or June clarifying its directive 92/12.
The UK argues that the directive means shoppers must physically transport
the wine themselves. 'We will continue to apply our interpretation and fight
it in the courts,' Customs and Excise said yesterday. If necessary, it
added, it would go to the European Court.
Any further relaxation of restrictions on alcohol imports from continental
Europe could devastate the UK brewing industry. The Brewers and Licensed
Retailers' Association said personal imports of beer reached 1.8m
hectolitres last year - equivalent to 15 per cent of all beer drunk at home.
When wine and spirits imports are added, drinks retailers in the UK are
estimated to have lost business worth Pounds 700m, while the government has
lost Pounds 300m in excise and value added tax.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Independent staff urge MMC probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Journalists at The Independent newspaper called yesterday for a full
Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation of the bid for its owner by
a consortium which includes Mirror Group Newspapers.
The appeal came in a formal statement to the Department of Trade and
Industry yesterday from the National Union of Journalists branch at the
paper, which represents 270 journalists out of 340 eligible editorial staff.
The journalists accused Mr Andreas Whittam Smith and the other founders of
The Independent of abandoning the paper's principles.
The statement said: 'If ever a takeover bid called for the impartial, public
scrutiny of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission this one does.'
The consortium - which groups MGN with The Independent's founders, El Pas of
Spain and La Repubblica of Italy - has made an improved offer for the shares
of Newspaper Publishing, owner of the two titles, valuing the company at
Pounds 73m.
The NUJ yesterday criticised the view of the consortium that an MMC
investigation should be waived on the grounds that it is 'a matter of great
urgency'.
It said: 'The degree of interest from other quarters suggests the exact
opposite.'
The journalists argue that if the plight of the newspapers really is urgent
all the leading shareholders including Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman of
Independent Newspapers of Ireland which holds 29.9 per cent, should try to
reach agreement on working together.
Newspaper Publishing is still awaiting an improved cash alternative to the
consortium offer before it can become a recommended bid. Independent
journalists believe redundancy terms may be causing a delay.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Backbench Euro-sceptics stoke Tory election fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The difficulties facing Conservative party leaders in producing a unifying
manifesto for the Euro-elections in June were further underlined by renewed
demands from backbench Euro-sceptics in the Commons yesterday.
In a debate on moves towards the enlargement of the European Union through
the inclusion of newly democratic states in central and eastern Europe, they
reiterated calls for the renegotiation of the Maastricht treaty.
Mr John Biffen, Conservative MP for Shropshire North and a former Cabinet
minister, maintained that enlargement of the EU must involve re-examination
of commitments to a single European currency, a central bank and economic
convergence of the member states.
Such questions, he said, were not merely being raised by the 'awkward squad'
on the Tory back benches.
Mr Biffen pressed for a clear statement from all the leaders of the European
Union on the prospects for enlargement in the context of re-negotiating
existing commitments.
Mr Bill Cash, Conservative MP for Stafford and the most persistent critic of
the Maastricht treaty, said it was 'perfectly apparent' that it was not
working.
He also suggested that the Treaty of Rome, on which the original European
Community was founded, needed to be renegotiated as well.
Mr Bernard Jenkin, Conservative MP for Colchester North, warned that orders
providing for association agreements with Bulgaria, the Czech and Slovak
republics and with Romania could lead to the period for phasing out tariffs
on 'sensitive' products continuing for as long as 10 years.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Court rules lorry owners negligent
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The owners of a lorry which ran out of control killing six people could face
prosecution after a coroner yesterday ruled that the deaths were
'involuntary unlawful killing'.
The inquest had heard that all eight brakes on the tipper truck were
defective when it crashed into a car and a van and ploughed into shops and
houses in Sowerby Bridge, West Yorkshire, in September.
Mr Mark Hinchliffe, deputy coroner for Halifax, exonerated the lorry driver,
who died in the crash.
Mr Hinchliffe told the hearing in Bradford that he had found a 'high
standard of proof' that the owners of the lorry - Fewston Transport of
Skipton, North Yorkshire - were grossly negligent.
Mr Hinchliffe said there were people in different capacities in Fewston
Transport who, by virtue of their office, responsibilities and expertise,
had a duty to have regard to the health, welfare and safety of road users,
and the public.
He said there was a breach of that duty in this case on the part of one or
more persons in failing to ensure that the brakes on the lorry were in good
working order.
'That breach of duty arose from gross negligence to such a degree which
should, in the opinion of this coroner's court, justify a conviction,' Mr
Hinchliffe said.
The coroner said the lorry had gone 49 working days since its last full
safety check with no credible evidence of another one imminent. It was not
the only lorry 'slipping through that particular net'.
Inspector Gary Walsh, who headed the investigation, said he intended 'to
have further discussions with the Crown Prosecution Service to assess the
most suitable way forward'.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Mercury wins first round of action against Oftel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercury, the UK tele-communications company, yesterday won the preliminary
court hearing of its action against BT, its principal competitor, and Oftel,
the telecommunications regulator. It is the first legal action to be pursued
against a regulator of the former state utilities.
Mercury claimed that Oftel had not offered it reasonable terms for the
carriage of its traffic by BT, through a consistent misinterpretation of
BT's government licence.
Mercury, which has about 10 per cent of the UK telecom market, uses BT's
network to deliver most calls made by its subscribers to their final
destination. At present it pays BT on a per minute basis using BT's charge
bands.
Mercury's victory yesterday means there will be a full hearing of its
application for a legal interpretation of that part of the licence which
deals with interconnection.
Mr Mike Harris, Mercury's chief executive, said he would be asking the court
to hear the case as soon as possible: 'Mercury's case is simple. All we want
is to obtain an independent interpretation of the correct basis on which the
director-general of Oftel must now set interconnect charges payable by
Mercury to BT.'
Otherwise, he said, the entire industry would continue to take risky
investment decisions while waiting for a decision.
'If interconnect charges were set on the basis of actual costs, Mercury
would be free to offer customers innovative prices and pricing packages,' he
said.

FT  01 MAR 94 / NBC seeks partners for fifth TV channel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NBC, the US network television broadcaster, is expressing serious interest
in applying to run a new national Channel 5 in the UK.
The US company could not by law control such a venture but it is starting to
look around for potential UK partners, including national newspaper groups.
NBC has been planning to expand into the European market for some time and
last year it bought control of Super Channel, the pan-European satellite
television channel.
The channel, renamed NBC Super Channel, carries top network programmes from
the US and has increased its business and financial news programming under
the chairmanship of Mr Patrick Cox.
NBC executives believe they could bring a new programme dimension to Channel
5, which three-quarters of the UK population could receive.
Last week the Independent Television Commission said it considered there was
a strong case for re-advertising the single national licence for Channel 5 .
The commission warned, however, that before taking a final decision it
needed confirmation from the government that the necessary frequencies would
remain available. The issue is whether a conventional analogue Channel 5
would be incom-patible with developing digital terrestrial television in the
UK.
Critics of the idea of a fifth channel using existing technology say the
frequencies it would use should be devoted to digital. That could make as
many as 100 television channels available in the UK, although special
decoders would be needed to watch them.
As the ITC continues its work developing a transmission plan for Channel 5,
the government has decided to use the interval 'to take stock' on Channel 5
and the present state of digital television. It is likely to be two or three
months before a decision, considerably longer than the ITC would have liked.
The Department of Trade and Industry is believed to be particularly
interested in the prospects for digital television.
The possible involvement of NBC means that there should be competition if a
Channel 5 licence is advertised. Last month MAI, the television and
financial services group, Time Warner, the US media giant, and Pearson,
owner of the Financial Times, said they had formed a consortium to bid for
the Channel 5 licence if one were to be advert-ised.
In December 1992 the ITC rejected the only bid for the licence on the
grounds that the business plan was not robust enough and that shareholders
were not sufficiently committed.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Dockers begin mass claim for unfair dismissal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Scores of dockers crowded a hall in Kent yesterday in a mass compensation
claim for unfair dismissal.
A total of 270 people who worked at the Kent port of Sheerness are involved
in one of the biggest cases of its kind in recent years.
The workers, who are mostly members of the TGWU general union, say they were
unfairly dismissed a year ago after the port was privatised, when the new
owners moved to cut wages. About a third are still unemployed. As well as
claiming compensation many say they want their former jobs back.
More than 100 claimants, including dockers, clerks and security workers,
attended the opening day of the tribunal, held in a sports hall in Ashford.
Mr John Couch, the workers' solicitor, said before the hearing that their
mood was one of anger over the way they had been treated. He added: 'Some
had worked at Sheerness for 30 years.'
The workers sat on specially built seating listening to the opening address
by Mr Alan Hannah, for the port's employers, who told the three tribunal
members that this was a 'very unhappy case'.
The dockers laughed when Mr Hannah told the tribunal that the employers had
not intended to cut wages.
Managers had to target high wages and working practices at Sheerness to keep
the port viable and improve efficiency, he said. They drew up changes in pay
and conditions which were rejected by the union.
Mr Hannah said: 'The objective was to make the operation efficient. Old
practices were to be looked at, but not at the cost of savage wage cuts or
compulsory redundancies among the labour force. That was not the intention.'
He admitted the company proposed sweeping changes in pay and conditions but
said the syndicate which lent the new owners Pounds 15m could have taken
control of the port and made large-scale redundancies if the cuts were not
achieved.
'The management's position was desperate. If savings could not be made by
agreement wages would have to be reduced unilaterally,' he said.
Dockers began a work-to-rule in protest at new contracts but later accepted
redundancy, he added.
Outside the tribunal dockers said the new management had tried to cut wages
by 60 per cent after privatisation.
The workers, some of whom are now employed at the port of Sheerness as
contractors, could qualify for payments of Pounds 13,000 each if they win
their claim.
The hearing is scheduled to run until March 28.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Shift to indirect tax tops G7 rivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK tax system underwent the largest shift among G7 countries from direct
to indirect taxes in the years 1981 to 1991, figures from the Central
Statistical Office show, Philip Coggan writes.
In its latest issue of Economic Trends, the CSO shows that Britain was the
most heavily reliant of G7 countries on value added tax, which accounted for
19 per cent of tax and social security contributions in 1991. This was a 7
percentage-point increase from 1981, the largest in the G7.
Britain was the only country to see a significant decline in the proportion
of tax and social security contributions as a percentage of GNP, thanks to a
decline in direct taxes.
However, the survey period starts from 1981, a tax-raising year in the UK,
and ends before the recent tax increases.

The government has backed down on plans to make employers contribute up to
50 per cent of the cost of special facilities for disabled employees.
The proposal, by Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, has been deferred
for a year after representations from bodies, including the Royal National
Institute for the Blind. They had warned that the measures would discourage
the employment of disabled people.
A revised scheme, called Access to Work, was formally launched yesterday by
Mr Hunt. It will fund such measures as adaptations to premises, fares to
work and the reader service for blind people. A cap of Pounds 21,000 has
been put on the amount of help an individual can be given over five years.
The announcement coincided with the publication of a study by the National
Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux which said that tougher measures were
needed to protect the growing number of people who faced discrimination at
work and when looking for jobs.
The bureaux said inadequate legislation, coupled with diminishing job
security and a steady stripping away of workers' rights, had given employers
increased freedom to act on prejudice, making it harder for some groups,
such as disabled people and ethnic minorities, to get work.
Ms Ann Clwyd, shadow employment minister, welcomed the government's decision
not to introduce what she called a levy on employers.

to work together.
Local organisations will be able to bid for grants to finance projects that
increase the use of volunteers under a new award scheme proposed by the
government. The first awards will be made later this year.
Voluntary-sector leaders are concerned that in addition to calling for
concerted action the government could do more to encourage the use of
voluntary workers in areas such as health and education, where it has direct
responsibility.
Today's announcement coincides with the restructuring of Action Resource
Centre, the charitable organisation that arranges the secondment of
employees with business skills to voluntary organisations. It is to be known
as Action: Employees in the Community and will operate in conjunction with
Business in the Community.
This week also sees the launch of the government-supported Community
Development Foundation's Streets Ahead initiative, a campaign aimed at
encouraging the corporate sector to recognise the value of developing
practical links with community-based organisations.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Patten offers schools cash for technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An ambitious package of subsidies, linked to contributions from businesses,
for schools which specialise in technology was announced by the education
department yesterday in an attempt to encourage extra investment by industry
in education.
Twelve schools have raised the necessary threshold of Pounds 100,000 from
about 40 local businesses and qualify for additional government funding. All
business donations will be matched pound-for-pound by the government.
Schools will also receive an extra Pounds 100 per pupil per year for seven
years from the government - Pounds 80,000 for a typical secondary school -
in return for drawing up seven-year business plans. Some plans include
formal 'output' targets for improved examination results, while other
schools have undertaken to increase the length of the school day and to
increase the proportion of students taking science GCSEs.
Mr John Patten, education secretary, announced that new technology colleges
would be a 'pilot' for the scheme, which he hoped would be extended to
schools specialising in business and languages, sports, art and music.
The schools are expected to use the extra funding to invest in extra capital
resources used for teaching science and technology.
Mr Patten predicted that more than 100 other schools would apply for funding
by the same route in the next two years, with further announcements expected
within weeks.
However, the Confederation of British Industry voiced reservations about
concentrating resources for technology in specialist schools.
Ms Margaret Murray, CBI education director, said: 'We want all schools to be
strong in technology. We think it's as important as mathematics, science and
English. Can you imagine a situation where you had a 'mathematics college'
whose funding was vulnerable and dependent on business input?'
She said the CBI did not believe that funding compulsory education was a
business responsibility.
The Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities attacked the
government's decision to limit the new funds to voluntary-aided schools and
grant-maintained schools which had opted out of local authority control. It
said it was considering a legal challenge.
The response from companies appears to have been much more buoyant than for
the previous City Technology College initiative, in which companies were
asked to fund the building of new schools on greenfield sites.
That scheme was launched in 1988 and only 15 have been completed.
The Garfield Weston Foundation is making Pounds 50,000 donations to 10
schools. Several companies which make technology equipment for schools are
also involved. Corporate sponsors include GEC Marconi Avionics, Data
Collections Systems, Motorola, Apricot Computers, Pearl Assurance, Thomas
Cook, Midland Bank, ADT, Research Machines, Acorn Computers, Tandberg (UK)
and Lucas Aerospace.
The 12 schools, only one of which is selective, are in Basildon and Saffron
Walden in Essex; Bromley in London; Camberley and Epsom in Surrey; Carlisle;
Chatham in Kent; Gloucester; Nottingham; Peterborough; Sleaford in
Lincolnshire; and Wolverhampton.

FT  01 MAR 94 / SIB bans Levitt from securities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Roger Levitt, disgraced former chairman of the Levitt Group which
collapsed with Pounds 34m in debts, is the first person to be indefinitely
banned from the investment business in Britain.
The Securities and Investments Board said yesterday that, for the first
time, it has exercised its powers under section 59 of the Financial Services
Act.
SIB said its powers under the act do not actually allow it to publicise the
names of individuals who are banned but anyone reading the register kept
under section 102 of the act will be able to keep track of such actions.
Although an appeals process is available, Mr Levitt did not use it.
Mr Levitt, who was convicted of deceiving the self-regulating body Fimbra
about the financial condition of his company, will not be able to re-enter
the business without the express permission of the SIB. That means he is not
allowed to hold a controlling interest in a company in the securities
industry, although he may be allowed to own a few shares in an authorised
business.
Outrage followed the sentencing of Mr Levitt to perform only 180 hours
community service, especially after photos of him celebrating his sentence
showed him sipping expensive champagne in a well-appointed north London
home.
Mr Levitt has since said in press interviews that he intends to leave the
securities industry, concentrating instead on becoming a sports management
consultant through his contacts with Home Box Office television in the US.
He has also said he is interested in selling a new kind of steam cleaner.
The Serious Fraud Office had been criticisd for allowing Mr Levitt to be
tried on a single charge of deceiving the regulator rather than broader
charges of fraudulent trading. In addition to wealthy individuals, leading
insurance companies lost millions investing in his company.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Rao government goes for gamble on growth: Admission of
soaring borrowings overshadows Indian budget cuts in taxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL and SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Manmohan Singh, the Indian finance minister, announced measures to
liberalise the economy and promote growth yesterday, improving
convertibility of the rupee and cutting interest rates, customs duties and
taxes.
But the reforms, set out in the annual budget speech, were overshadowed by
an admission that government borrowings have soared in the past year far
above targets - to levels at which they are prompting some observers to
voice fears about the country's economic stability.
Mr Singh disclosed that because of lower than expected tax and customs
revenues and higher than anticipated spending on subsidies and other items,
the fiscal deficit for the year to the end of March would be about 7.3 per
cent of gross domestic product, compared with a target of 4.7 per cent. The
target for the new year starting in April is to be 6 per cent.
While acknowledging the dangers of his policies, Mr Singh was adamant 'that
the risks involved in the course of action I have proposed do not cross the
limits of prudence.'
The budget was widely seen as relying on increased economic activity to
bring higher government revenues and so eventually cut public borrowing.
Industrialists hailed the steps to encourage growth. Mr Bansi Dhar,
president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry,
said: 'The budget has all the ingredients to take India to the world's
front-ranking nations.'
However they expressed fears about the fiscal deficit and disappointment at
the lack of bold deregulatory initiatives. The Bombay stock exchange
30-share index closed 50.37 points up at 4,287.98.
Mr Singh was presenting his fourth budget since the government took office
in 1991 and responded to a balance of payments crisis by embarking on
India's most extensive reforms since independence.
He expressed concern about the fiscal deficit and pledged to 'return to the
path of fiscal rectitude'. He also promised to continue with pro-market
reform and promoting international trade and investment.
Mr Singh said in his speech that borrowings had grown more than expected
because revenues had fallen short of target mainly because industry was
stagnant. Attempts to cut the deficit sharply 'might well have been
counter-productive'.
The risks of a big deficit were manageable because food stocks were high and
industry had plenty of surplus capacity so the danger of increased inflation
(now running at 8.5 per cent a year) was low.
The main reason Mr Singh has been able to take this course is the country's
external account performance. Because of incentives the government has given
to foreign trade and investment since it embarked on reform in mid-1991,
exports are soaring.
Foreign exchange reserves have leapt to a record Dollars 13bn (Pounds 8.8bn)
from Dollars 1bn in mid-1991. India no longer feels the need to kow-tow to
the International Monetary Fund, which granted emergency loans in 1991 on
condition that public borrowings were cut.
Mr Singh yesterday announced that India would repay Dollars 1.4bn early to
the IMF, a prudent economic move but also a potent political gesture.
For foreign companies, the notable points of interest in the budget are the
decision to make the rupee fully convertible on the current account, which
should make non-trade transactions easier to process, and further reductions
in customs duties, which should promote imports into India.
But the budget lacks bold deregulatory initiatives. No indication has been
given of a willingness to reform labour laws to increase employers' powers
to dismiss workers, often cited as a disincentive by potential investors in
India.
Items in the budget included:
Maximum customs duty rates are cut from 85 to 65 per cent, plus reductions
in specific categories designed to promote imports of parts and raw
materials. Duties on steel are to fall from 75-85 per cent to a maximum of
50 per cent.
Maximum corporate tax rate is cut from 50 to 40 per cent, though a 15 per
cent surcharge stays. Taxes on foreign companies operating in India are cut
from 65 to 55 per cent.
An expenditure (sales) tax on hotels is cut from 20 to 10 per cent to boost
tourism.
A wide-ranging overhaul is to be made of indirect taxes, including reducing
exemptions and special cases so that hundreds of rules will be scrapped.
Indirect taxes will be extended to services, notably 5 per cent levies on
telephone bills, non-life insurance premiums and stockbrokers' commissions.
A further Rs57bn (Pounds 1.2bn) is to help recapitalise state-owned banks;
and there are promises to increase spending on education, health, defence,
technology and agriculture.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Hebron killings kindle anger of Israeli Arabs: A threat to
co-existence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOROVITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mohammed Abu Jamar, a 22-year-old bedouin Arab who worked as a waiter in a
Tel Aviv restaurant, got married two weeks ago. Yesterday he was buried in
his home town of Rahat, in the southern Negev, the first Israeli Arab to die
in clashes with the police for almost 20 years.
So far, Abu Jamar is the only fatality in four days of running street
battles between Israeli Arabs and police in the aftermath of Friday's Hebron
mosque massacre. But dozens have been injured and dozens more arrested.
The Palestinian intifada - the spontaneous uprising against Israeli
occupation that erupted in the Gaza Strip and West Bank more than six years
ago - has spread across the pre-1967 borders and into Israel itself. And
Israel's political leaders, calling crisis meetings with leading members of
the Arab community and urging the police to use as much restraint as
possible, can only hope that it will die down once time has begun to heal
the Hebron wounds.
From the Knesset podium yesterday, Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
appealed to the 800,000-strong Arab community - one fifth of the country's
population - to remember their decades of peaceful co-existence with the
Jews.
'You are part of us,' he declared. 'You've been with us for decades, through
thick and thin. Loyal partners. We've managed to achieved co-existence and
we want to maintain it.'
But as Mr Rabin delivered his appeal, many of his target audience were
otherwise engaged. For the fourth straight day, in towns and villages from
Abu Jamar's Rahat in the south, to the Galilee in the north, hundreds of
Arab youths were stoning policemen, and facing rubber bullets and tear gas
in return.
In Nazareth, Israel's largest Arab town, windows were smashed on four
Israeli buses. Egged, the national bus company, was told to divert its
routes elsewhere.
In Jaffa, the Arab half of Tel Aviv where some of the worst rioting has been
taking place, a police promise to release dozens of Arabs who had been
arrested in the past few days brought a measure of calm.
But in Rahat, before Abu Jamar's funeral, a group of bedouin protesters,
waving Palestinian flags, chanted anthems familiar from the occupied
territories: 'With fire and blood we shall avenge the fallen. With fire and
blood we shall redeem Palestine.'
Up and down the country, local Arab leaders appealed to the police to clear
out, to enable them to calm the inflamed populace. 'There is a deep crisis
in Arab-Jewish relations,' said Nazareth teacher Ali Zaydan. 'I don't know
who can join them back together.'
Many analysts have been ascribing the ferocious and unexpected outpouring of
Arab rage to the increasing popularity of the Israeli Arab Islamic Movement,
which professes to work peacefully for the advancement of Israeli Arabs, but
is regarded with deep suspicion by most Israeli leaders.
Some Israeli Jews, though, have acknowledged a deeper cause: the
discrimination still routinely suffered by Arab citizens, the minimal
government funding for their local councils, the poorer education system,
the higher unemployment rates.
If Israel wants to avoid its Arabs rioting again in the future, said Dr
Alexander Blei, a former prime ministerial adviser on Arab affairs, 'the
government must introduce policies to bring full equality for Israeli
Arabs'.
But perhaps the most fundamental problem is that Israeli Arabs know that
Jews, to a greater or lesser extent, still doubt their loyalty, still do not
really regard them as 'proper Israelis'.
In an interview after the Israeli-PLO accord was signed at the White House
last September, the Israeli Arab poet Samih al-Qasem spoke of how Israeli
Arabs have felt in the past 'as if we were a fifth column. A time bomb. A
demographic danger.' So the peace accord, he said, had come as a profound
relief, a signal that Israeli Arabs could now 'truly integrate'. Sadly, it
seems, he may have spoken too soon.

The Palestine Liberation Organisation is to send envoys to Washington to
discuss with the US its 'requirements' for resuming peace talks with Israel,
following last week's massacre of Palestinians in Hebron, senior PLO
officials said yesterday.
The PLO representatives would seek US pressure on Israel to take tougher
steps to protect Palestinians in the occupied territories than those
announced at the weekend by Israel's Premier Yitzhak Rabin. The PLO has
already rejected as 'inadequate' Mr Rabin's move to disarm a few of the most
extreme Jewish settlers.
In Israel, Mr Rabin appealed to the PLO and the Arab states who have
suspended their peace talks with Israel (Syria, Lebanon and Jordan) to
return to the negotiating table. If they did not, they would be handing
victory to the extremists. At the same time, he rejected Palestinian demands
for all 120,000 Jewish settlers in the occupied territories to be disarmed
and for some settlements to be dismantled.
The PLO was also calling for United Nations observers in the occupied
territories.
In Washington, the State Department said the US believed the Israelis and
Palestinians should continue to negotiate on the basis of the declaration of
principles they signed at the White House last September, rather than
setting out new conditions.
'The agenda is the declaration of principles and how it can be implemented
and the full range of issues associated with the declaration. That has been
the agenda and will likely remain the agenda and must remain the agenda for
them to move ahead in the process,' said Mr Michael McCurry, State
Department spokesman.
Although the separate bilateral talks between Israel and Jordan, Syria and
Lebanon broke off on Sunday, the US believes they will resume. State
Department officials said Mr Farouk Sharaa, Syrian foreign minister, had
assured Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, that the break in the
talks represented 'a pause, not a retreat'.
The PLO hopes last Friday's massacre will galvanise international, and
especially US, opinion behind its demands; it believes this offers the only
prospect of forcing further concessions from the Israelis.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Commission to probe mosque murders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOROVITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Israel appointed a five-member commission to investigate Friday's
massacre at Hebron's Cave of the Patriarchs, the Israeli army yesterday
released an interim report acknowledging security failures, but rejecting
Palestinian claims Israeli soldiers contributed to the death toll, David
Horovitz reports.
The investigation found Dr Baruch Goldstein fired 111 bullets into the rows
of kneeling worshippers. His Galil rifle was recovered, and all the shells
collected inside the mosque were found to have been fired from it.
The interim investigation, carried out by the army's central command,
established that five soldiers were on duty when Goldstein, a radical Jewish
settler, slipped into the building. Four other soldiers supposed to have
been on duty had over-slept.
Poor siting of closed-circuit TV cameras enabled Goldstein to make his way
into the mosque, crowded with about 400 Moslem worshippers, without being
seen.
On the basis of this finding, Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin told the
Knesset (parliament) yesterday that eye-witness claims of Israeli soldiers
killing Palestinians inside the mosque were 'nonsense'.
The army estimated Goldstein sprayed bullets for 60-90 seconds. The senior
officer on duty said he had tried to enter the mosque to intervene, but
found one entrance blocked; when he reached a second, he was pushed back by
fleeing Palestinians.

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hong Kong's Consumer Council yesterday made a stinging attack on the
colony's banking system, calling for deregulation of interest rates and more
financial disclosure from the banks.
The council estimated profits earned by the colony's banking cartel through
restrictive practices had grown to 0.8 per cent of Hong Kong's gross
domestic product in 1991 from 0.3 per cent in 1985, or to HKDollars 5.2bn
(Pounds 452m) from HKDollars 1.2bn.
Since 1964, interest rates for small deposits in Hong Kong have been subject
to an agreement between banks. Banks were also allowed to understate or
overstate their actual profits by making secret transfers (or withdrawals)
of profits to (or from) 'inner reserves'.
The council said it could find no argument to support the old rationale in
favour of the cartel, that the interest rate agreement prevented cut-throat
competition. 'The banking sector is now more stable and is subject to
vigilant supervision of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority,' it said.
The council said agreement covering interest rates on deposits below Dollars
HK500,000 should be phased out by 1997; by 1996 banks' annual and interim
results should be published on a fully disclosed basis. At present, only
HSBC Holdings, parent of Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, and Hang Seng Bank, an
HSBC listed subsidiary, produce fully disclosed financial results. The HSBC
group of banks reported annual results yesterday.
Since Governor Chris Patten arrived in Hong Kong in 1992 the colonial
government has stressed competition in its economic policy. The main author
of the report, Prof Edward Chen of Hong Kong University, sits on Mr Patten's
executive council.

Malaysia stepped up its action against British business yesterday with the
announcement that certain groups of Malaysian students would not now be sent
to Britain.
Many thousands of Malaysians study at British universities and colleges.
The Malaysian Trust Council, a government-backed agency, said that about
1,000 students it had intended sending to Britain would now go elsewhere.
The council would terminate a contract with a British company which places
Malaysian students in British universities, it added.
Last Friday, Malaysia announced a ban on giving government contracts to
British companies in retaliation for reports in the British media alleging
that senior Malaysian officials had taken payments from British companies
which had been seeking contracts in Malaysia.
Mr Sulaiman Daud, Malaysian education minister, said Malaysian colleges
should end twinning arrangements with British educational institutions.
'Private colleges which do not comply will be risking their business,' Mr
Sulaiman added.
Concern has been expressed by British companies that virtually all contracts
in Malaysia, whether public or private ones, would be affected by the ban.
Mrs Rafidah Aziz, Malaysian minister for trade and industry, said yesterday
that the move against British companies should not be viewed in any way as a
trade barrier or sanction.
'The notion that Malaysia had imposed trade sanctions against Britain is not
true at all,' the trade and industry minister declared.
'It's merely centred on not entertaining tenders from British firms.'

FT  01 MAR 94 / Japan reviews defence policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese government yesterday opened the first review of defence policy
for nearly 20 years.
A nine-member panel of busi-nessmen, academics and civil servants, named by
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, held its first meeting and is to re-port
by the summer on Japan's changing defence needs.
It will have to strike a balance between pressure for defence cuts and fears
of weaker US commitment to Japan's security when regional stability is at
risk.
'As the world has changed dramatically after the collapse of the Cold War
structure, our handling of defence and security must change as well,' Mr
Hosokawa told the panel yesterday.
Any change in defence policy is politically sensitive. Only three months
ago, Mr Keisuke Nakanishi, director-general of the defence agency (the
Japanese equivalent of defence minister), resigned after suggesting Japan's
pacifist constit-ution be revised to let its soldiers take a combat role
under United Nations command.
Japan's military, at 246,000 personnel, is already small by the standards of
its regional neighbours - less than half the size of that of South Korea.
Defence spending per head is smaller than Italy's.
This is a consequence of Japan's post-war pacifism and reliance on 24,000 US
troops, 190 aircraft, and the 60 vessels of the US Seventh Fleet stationed
in and around Japan.
The government has started to squeeze the defence budget, after more than a
decade of above-average increases. It will rise this year by only 0.8 per
cent, the smallest increase for 34 years. The Japanese military is also
planning to reduce the number of army bases by 40 per cent from 1996.
The right wing of the government coalition believes the personnel reduction
should be accompanied by more spending on electronic defence, such as the
two advanced airborne warning and control systems aircraft and the upgraded
computers for Patriot missiles included in this year's budget.
On the other side of the debate, the Social Democratic party, largest member
of the coalition, is in theory committed to unarmed neutrality, but is
content simply to see a continued squeeze on defence spending.

Japan's industrial economy continues to bump along the bottom of a
recession, but government efforts to boost private housing have begun to
lift household spending, William Dawkins writes.
That is the message from Japan's latest mixed bag of statistics yesterday,
indicating clear signs of recovery have yet to emerge.
Industrial production fell 3.1 per cent in January, against the equivalent
month in 1993, setting a new record of 28 months of year-on-year declines,
the ministry of international trade and industry said. But output recovered
0.9 per cent from December's level, a slight rebound from the previous
month's 1.9 per cent decline. Industrial production represents just under a
third of economic activity in Japan.
Despite the industrial gloom, strong growth continued in low-cost housing,
helped by subsidised government loans and low prices. Housing starts rose
20.7 per cent in January, from a year earlier, the 20th month of
year-on-year increases, the construction ministry said.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Legacy of apartheid may bless its creator: Patti Waldmeir
tries to fathom why some blacks may vote for the National party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President FW de Klerk is driven out of coloured townships by stones and
bullets; constitution minister Roelf Meyer has goat's bile poured over his
head in an African ritual - all part of the National party's quest to
persuade the victims of apartheid, South Africa's non-white voters, to
support their erstwhile oppressors in all-race elections in April.
However immoral or impossible this may seem to outsiders, South African
politicians know that it is a real prospect. The NP seems assured of
significant support in coloured and Indian communities; and even among black
Africans, it could partly contain the expected landslide for the African
National Congress.
The party's biggest campaign handicap - apartheid - could yet prove its
greatest strength. For apartheid set out to divide South Africa by race and
tribe, and to breed in blacks a sense of inferiority which fosters
subservience; and it is exactly that legacy of racism, ethnicity and
dependency which seems to motivate non-whites to vote NP.
Most coloured voters say they will vote NP because they 'do not like
blacks'; black NP supporters cite tribalism as a reason for opposing the
ANC, which they claim is dominated by the Xhosa tribe; both say they do not
believe blacks are capable of running a sophisticated economy.
Even in modern, urban, ethnically-mixed Soweto, the National party can tap a
deep vein of tribalism and inverted racism. Mr David Chuenyane, the NP's
chief black organiser, relies heavily on ethnic scare stories, such as his
claim that ANC officials in the civil service are sacking any public servant
who is not a Xhosa (even though there are no ANC officials in top positions
yet and no such sackings have been reported).
He doubts the ability of blacks to run the South African economy: 'The
whites are the brains behind the economy,' he says, noting that 'the blacks
did provide the labour'. He fears affirmative action because 'I have seen in
the African states what it has done', saying blacks are not used to handling
large sums of money and implying that corruption will be the inevitable
result.
Mr Chuenyane candidly admits that his relationship with the NP is
opportunistic: 'I saw an opportunity in the NP and I said: the NP is
stranded, they need somebody black.' And anyway, he adds, when he returned
from decades in exile with the black-supremacist Pan Africanist Congress,
there were no good positions going in the ANC. So, he is asked, you sold
yourself to the highest bidder? 'It does look like that,' he says, with
hardly a hint of embarrassment.
Mr Chuenyane is almost certain to be elected as a member of parliament,
given that he is seventh on the NP's election list for the region around
Johannesburg. But his evident opportunism - and the shady personal history
of some other black NP candidates, including two notorious 'warlords' from
the western Cape - does little to inspire confidence among the electorate.
This may matter little. Blacks are not so much voting for the NP as against
the ANC. This is clear from the numerous hangers-on at the party's unmarked
Soweto offices (on the floor above the ANC office).
Asked why blacks should vote NP, Rocks Mseleku, a young NP organiser, tries
a number of replies: 'People join for the love of the party'; 'because the
party is open to blacks'; 'because they have changed their logo'.
He denies receiving payment as an organiser. But all organisers are paid, he
is told. 'I don't take it like that,' he says, adding that he receives
R2,000 (Pounds 386) a month, twice his previous salary, as 'compensation'.
Apart from paid officials, it is hard to find anyone in Soweto who admits
supporting the NP. Mr Chuenyane insists that public meetings are held almost
every weekend and house-to-house canvassing is constant. But when Soweto NP
information officer Vronda Banda takes a group of journalists out
canvassing, he goes only to the home of his parents, and to his friend Rocks
Mashinini, who refuses to shake his hand, and says his life is endangered by
the visit.
'The NP is the party of the oppressor, it's the party that tortured you,'
says Mr Mashinini, who like Mr Banda was once a member of the ANC's armed
wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation).
So far the party's attempts to create a new non-racial identity have
elicited either outrage or humour. When the long-suffering Mr Meyer went to
Soweto the weekend before last to be 'introduced to the ancestors' it was
hard not to laugh.
Comments Weekly Mail columnist Bafana Khumalo: 'Oh, it's tough being a New
Age Nationalist. To make it big these days you have to humour the natives,
whether it's shouting 'viva' at their meetings or listening to them when
they start their African gobbledegook.'
But it is the NP that could laugh last. Mr Chuenyane says 5 per cent would
be a good showing in Soweto (where there are perhaps 1.5m voters); opinion
polls show 1 per cent black support nationwide, but political intimidation
may render them unreliable.
The NP says it is aiming at nurses, teachers, civil servants, professionals
 -people with mortgages and a fear of victimisation. But it seems certain
that much NP support will come instead from the less educated, older, more
traditional residents such as Godfrey Mthembu, NP Soweto organiser: 'I know
I can never be over the white man. I know I need him. If I break my leg,
without his medicine I'm crippled for life.'
That was, after all, the message of apartheid. Indeed, South Africa's first
all-race poll may serve to reveal, through the support the NP gets among
blacks, just how successful apartheid was.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Major and Clinton mend their fences: The British premier's
visit to Pittsburgh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton last night offered British Prime Minister John Major
a lavish welcome to the US as the two leaders sought to reaffirm the
strength of the transatlantic alliance.
Greeting his guest in Pittsburgh, Mr Clinton deliberately put aside the
countries' recent differences over Bosnia and Northern Ireland. Instead, he
told a crowd of 3,000 that London and Washington were 'working in
partnership' around the world.
As Mr Major looked on with obvious satisfaction, the US president listed a
joint approach to the ending of the cold war and reform in Russia, a common
stance on the Gatt world trade talks and agreement now on the west's
approach to Bosnia as examples of the strength of the relationship.
Mr Clinton then went out of his way to praise the 'political courage and
vision' shown by the prime minister in trying to end the violence in
Northern Ireland. The president's remarks drew an equally warm response from
Mr Major, who emphasised the 'huge array of personal and business contacts
that bind the people of our nations'.
The Pittsburgh encounter - chosen because Mr Major's grandfather and father
had once lived there - followed intense talks between Mr Major and senior
administration and congressional figures on Bosnia, Russia and British
policy in Northern Ireland.
US officials said the two leaders' informal talks in a Pittsburgh restaurant
and during a visit to a new development on the site of an old industrial
complex in which Mr Major's grandfather might once have worked were a clear
signal that Washington still regarded Britain as a reliable ally.
Mr Major's aides, clearly anxious to show the special relationship was alive
and well, went to elaborate lengths to point up the generous amount of time
Mr Clinton had allocated to the visiting prime minister. Mr Major was due to
return to Washington late last night to stay with the Clintons at the White
House.
For his part Mr Major offered unequivocal support for the action of US
aircraft in Bosnia which shot down Serbian aircraft violating the United
Nations no-fly zone over the former Yugoslav province.
Praising the US for its efforts to broker a deal between the Bosnian Moslems
and Croatia, he said the search for a political settlement would go on in
parallel with efforts to extend the US's recent success in lifting the siege
of Sarajevo. Meanwhile, London and Washington would work jointly at the UN
to return Sarejevo to civilian administration.
Mr Major, who insisted that reports of a breach between the two governments
had been 'wildly overdone', also made it clear that he expected no real
dispute over Britain's approach to Northern Ireland.
British officials said Mr Major had won the support of both Mr Christopher
and Mr Gore for a policy of continuing to back Russian President Boris
Yeltsin despite the threat to his position caused by the release of the
leaders of last year's attempted coup.

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Mexican government and Zapatista rebels have entered their second week
of talks to end the two-month peasant uprising in the southern state of
Chiapas, amid conflicting reports on how close they are to a provisional
agreement.
Bishop Samuel Ruiz, the mediator, said a peace declaration was 'already
drawn up and agreed in fundamental terms'. He said a draft accord could be
ready by tomorrow, after which rebels would return to their villages and
consult their supporters.
However, Sub-commandant Marcos, the rebel spokesman, said there was still no
agreement on crucial issues, such as self-rule for indigenous peoples,
national electoral reforms and changes to the constitution that would permit
permanent re-distribution of land.
Part of the difference between him and the bishop may be due to the weight
given to any preliminary accord. The rebels have insisted that accords are
only 'mountains of paper' and that there can no peace until government
promises are fulfilled.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Bentsen may modify bank proposals: Fed is fighting its
corner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Plans to consolidate the multi-layered US bank regulation system will face a
crucial test this morning when Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary,
presents the administration's proposals to the Senate banking committee.
Three months after he outlined plans to draw the four federal bank
regulatory agencies into a single federal banking commission, Mr Bentsen is
expected to offer some flexibility in order to meet the complaints of the
Federal Reserve Board, which is fighting to preserve its regulatory
authority.
But the Treasury and the Fed have not yet reached a deal, and the Fed has
won considerable support from an array of bankers and state banking
supervisors who fear the concentration of too much regulatory power in a
single agency.
At the moment, the Fed oversees bank holding companies, foreign banks, and
state chartered banks which belong to the Federal Reserve system. Other
state banks are monitored at the federal level by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation, which runs the fund guaranteeing depositors in the
event of failure.
The separate category of nationally chartered banks comes under the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency, while savings and loan institutions are
overseen by the Office of Thrift Supervision.
The Fed argues that its ability to keep in close touch with the financial
system and prevent banking catastrophes would be diminished if it were
reduced to an observer's role in bank supervision, although some banking
observers point out that well respected central banks like the German
Bundesbank have no regulatory role at all.
To general surprise, bank reform legislation is now widely expected to pass
Congress this session. It is likely, however, to concentrate on measures
allowing banks to open branches outside their home states, not on regulatory
consolidation.
An interstate banking bill passed the Senate banking committee last month by
a unanimous vote after Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, who has held
up similar legislation for years by linking it to restrictions on banks'
ability to sell insurance, abandoned his opposition.
The House banking committee, whose influential financial institutions
subcommittee has already passed similar legislation, is expected to take up
the inter-state banking bill next week.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Peru telecoms go to Spanish bidder
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LIMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A consortium headed by Telefonica de Espana yesterday became the new owner
of the Peruvian telecommunications systems.
The Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.34bn) bid by the consortium it led had surpassed
the most optimistic expectations, easily outbidding groups headed by GTE and
South Western Bell/Korea Telecom, which offered Dollars 803m and Dollars
857m respectively.
The sale expands the role of Telefonica de Espana in the expanding Latin
American telecommunications market. It already has big stakes in Venezuela,
Argentina and Chile.
Hundreds packed the auditorium of Lima's National Museum yesterday for the
opening of the bids in Peru's largest privatisation so far.
The sale was considered a success and should boost forthcoming
privatisations. It was run by UK-based Morgan Grenfell, with Coopers &amp;
Lybrand as management consultants.
The winning consortium has three Peruvian partners with 5 per cent apiece -
the Wiese Bank, construction company Grana y Montero, and brewer Backus and
Johnston.
Telefonica Peru, as the new operator will call itself, acquires 35 per cent
of Lima's telephone company, CPT, after capital increases in the original 20
per cent state holding. The remaining shares are held privately and are
actively traded on the Lima stock exchange.
Also, Telefonica wins a 35 per cent controlling interest in Entel, the
Peruvian state provincial and long-distance monopoly. The new owner will
continue to enjoy monopoly on the long-distance service for the next five
years.
It is expected that Telefonica will have to invest Dollars 1bn-Dollars 1.5bn
over the next five years to meet the sale conditions, which call for a
virtual trebling of Peru's 630,000 lines. The company will also have to
ensure that every Peruvian town of more than 500 inhabitants has a telephone
service.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Brazil unveils details of plan for real currency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil yesterday unveiled details of its plan to replace the currency, the
cruzeiro real, which is plagued by annual inflation of about 2,500 per cent.
This is part of an overall economic restructuring programme for Brazil, the
only large South American economy still grappling with near hyper-inflation.
A new accounting unit, the URV (real unit of value), is to come into effect
today. Its value will be fixed at Dollars 1 (67 pence) but its cruzeiro
equivalent will be increased daily to reflect inflation of the local
currency. Salaries must be denominated in URVs, with immediate effect. The
government hopes the private sector will switch other prices and contracts
voluntarily.
Once the URV has gone into widespread use, probably not before May, the
cruzeiro is to be abolished. A new currency called the real, fixed at parity
to the URV, is to take its place. The government chose this complicated
two-step process to let contracts be adjusted to the new accounting unit and
avoid legal challenges.
Mr Winston Fritsch, economic policy secretary, described the URV as an
'economic lobotomy', designed to remove Brazilians' memory and expectation
of inflation.
The country's profligate governments, federal and state, have been forced to
issue short-term securities at very high interest rates to finance their
budget deficits. This has fuelled inflation. Partly as a result, the economy
has become highly indexed, with prices often adjusted several times each
month to reflect past inflation.
The government hopes that, by linking all contracts and prices to the URV,
prices will continue to increase in cruzeiro terms but will be stable in URV
and dollar terms. Once people realise the URV is stable, expectations of
inflation will wither. 'Only when we move to the real will the fall in
inflation be rapid,' according to Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, finance
minister.
Most economists agree the plan works, in theory, and that it was correct to
tackle the budget deficit first. The government finished negotiating the
budget with Congress last week and can now claim it has closed a projected
deficit of about 5 per cent of GDP.
Even so, the economic programme still faces many problems, especially
political pressures to increase spending before the presidential and
congressional elections in October. Also, the compulsory conversion of
salaries into URVs may be unpopular, especially since the government had
promised conversion would be voluntary.

FT  01 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Japan warns US it may retaliate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A high-ranking Japanese trade official yesterday warned that, if the US were
to impose sanctions against Japan and its action were found to be in breach
of Gatt rules, Japan could retaliate against the US.
The US has already said it would impose sanctions against Japan over a
dispute regarding Japan's opening of its mobile phones market. There are
also moves in the US to reinstate the Super 301 US trade act clause, which
gives Washington the right to impose sanctions against unfair trade
practices.
However, Mr Yoshihiro Sakamoto, director-general of the industrial trade
policy bureau at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, admitted
the yen's appreciation, which has hurt Japan's exporters and dampened its
near-term recovery prospects, has its benefits for Japanese industry too.
He said that, while the yen's rapid appreciation has had a negative impact
on the Japanese economy, in the long run the currency realignment would help
change Japan's industrial structure by forcing a general restructuring.
'I believe that, over a long time span, the higher yen will have an impact
on the competitiveness of Japanese goods and services and that, as a result,
Japan's industrial structure will change over time,' Mr Sakamoto said. 'As a
result, the export-oriented industrial structure will gradually change as
the yen's appreciation forces uncompetitive industries to move production
overseas.'
The Japanese government needed to do more to encourage this change in
industrial structure, by promoting greater inward investment.
The government has targetted four main areas where it will work to change
Japan's export-oriented industrial structure, help increase imports and
thereby benefit consumers as well as reduce the country's huge trade
surplus, a target of international criticism.
The areas are: deregulation to help increase imports and foreign investment,
improvement of government procurement procedures, new measures to increase
imports and foreign investment, and improvements in competition policy.

Alcatel, Compagnie Generale des Eaux, US Telecom East and other foreign
telecom providers are among the winners of eastern Europe's first tender to
operate local telephone services, Hungary announced yesterday.
The telecommunications ministry said the auction of the eight-year exclusive
local concessions had raised Ft8.2bn (Dollars 80m). Foreign-led consortia
won in 15 of Hungary's 54 telephone districts, committing themselves to
invest Ft20bn in the first three years alone.
Bidders committed themselves to increasing line density by 15.5 per cent a
year and promised that by 1997 users would not have to wait more than a year
for a line.
CGE, the French public utility group, paid the highest single fee, of
Ft1.3bn, for the rights to Szeged, the largest city in south-eastern
Hungary, and won one other district.
United Telecom Services - a partnership of French telecoms equipment maker
Alcatel and US Telecom East, a local telecommunications operator based in
the US - was the winner in four areas. Central Euro Telecom and Hungarian
Telephone &amp; Cable Corporation, both US-led consortia, won two districts
each.
The capital, Budapest, and 38 other districts are retained by Matav, the
national telecommunications operator, in which Deutsche Telekom of Germany
and Ameritech of the US took a stake of 30 per cent for Dollars 875m in
December.
The tender is an element of Hungary's relatively liberal line in telecoms
policy. Allowing separate local and national providers of telephone
services, the pattern in the US, is unusual in western Europe.
The telecommunications ministry also said it would be prepared to grant
licences for local telephone operators to provide cable television services
in parallel. Hungary would be one of few countries where the barrier between
telecommunications and television has been breached.

FT  01 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Malaysia sees trebling of telecoms in six
years

<TEXT>
The Malaysian government wants to more than treble the size of its telephone
network in the next six years, and is anxious for western telecoms companies
to help, the country's telecommunications minister said yesterday.
Mr Samy Vellu told an FT conference on Asia-Pacific telecommunications in
Hong Kong that Malaysia planned to increase its number of phone subscribers
from 2.3m to 7.8m by 2000 as 'a core aspect of our infrastructure
modernisation'.
It looked to western operators and equipment suppliers to play an 'active
role'. Mr Vellu made no reference to the Malaysian government's ban on state
contracts going to UK companies.
Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK telecommunications group with a majority share in
Hong Kong Telecom, is keen to invest in Malaysia. It has been in talks with
Binariang, a private Malaysian company which recently gained a digital
cellular telephony licence and is believed to be seeking a western strategic
partner with which to build its network.
Mr Joseph Farina, president of network systems for Nynex, the US regional
Bell operator which has invested in Thailand, said Nynex's joint venture
with local partners to build 2m new lines for the Bangkok area was 'an
attractive model' for other partnership projects in the region, notably in
China. Nynex is one of several US operators investing in the region's
countries with emerging markets.
Mr Farina contrasted the equivalence in the number of phones and television
sets per head in the US - about 1.2 - with the position in Asia. Vietnam has
26 people per TV but 435 people per telephone. 'That is an important
validation for us of the likely boom in the Asian telecoms market,' he said.
Mr Andrew Harrington, Asia telecoms analyst with Salomon Brothers in Hong
Kong, predicted that the market capitalisation of listed telecoms companies
in the region would increase from about Dollars 85bn to Dollars 150bn over
the next four years, with the number of listed companies rising from about
20 to 50.
Mr Alex Arena, Hong Kong's telecommunications regulator, said the Hong Kong
government's aim was to make the colony a 'telecommunications hub' for the
region by pursuing strong pro-competition policies. Hong Kong Telecom's
monopoly in domestic traffic is to expire next year. Three companies have
been licensed to enter the market.
The Australian government is pursuing still stronger competition policies,
giving all city residents the chance to vote to change telephone company in
municipal ballots. Mr Robin Davey, Australian telecommunications regulator,
said more than 50 per cent of residents had voted.

FT  01 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Wood row goes against Gatt grain - US
pressure on Japan to cut timber import tariffs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the Ohashis, a family living in Yokohama, built their house, they chose
to use an American-style structure and imported wood from Washington state.
'We really liked the design - it's warm in the winter, cool in the summer
and keeps the moisture out,' the Ohashis say.
They are among a growing number of Japanese who are choosing North American
lumber for their homes rather than the traditional cedar found throughout
Japan's mountainous landscape. The trend has helped to fuel a bustling trade
in wood products imported into Japan not only from the American continent
but from as far off as Finland and Sweden.
This trade in wood products has become the focus of a row between the US and
Japan that has cast a shadow over the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation
talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The US is unhappy with an offer by Japan to reduce tariffs on wood products
that was made last year to conclude the Uruguay Round talks.
The Japanese offer was to reduce tariffs by 51 per cent on a trade-weighted
average and on certain products by 33 per cent in accordance with a separate
US-Japan agreement in 1990. It was accepted last year by the US and other
countries.
Since then, however, the US has called on Japan to eliminate tariffs on wood
products altogether. This has upset Japanese officials. 'We don't want to
re-open negotiations, we don't want to unravel the package,' one Japanese
official said.
On Friday Japan duly submitted its tariff schedules to Gatt on the lines of
the offer made during the Uruguay Round negotiations.
However, pressure on Japan to reduce its tariffs on wood products further is
unlikely to be eased.
In a recent newspaper advertisement, the American Forest and Paper
Association noted that, were the Japanese government to remove its tariffs
on imported wood, it would improve the lifestyle of the people, stimulate
the economy and take leadership on the international stage of trade.
The association noted that by some estimates, if tariffs were removed, the
cost of constructing a wooden house in Japan would fall by about 20 per
cent.
It is an argument that is likely to find widespread support among the
Japanese public, frustrated at being charged several times more for a house
than would be the case in most other countries.
The bureaucrats and industry officials who consider US demands unreasonable
argue that there are sound reasons for not giving in.
The first is that the Japanese wood industry could be driven to annihilation
if tariffs are removed entirely. The industry has already been damaged by
the flood of imports which now dominate the market.
In the early 1960s, the Japanese government, faced with a construction boom
and a shortage of domestic wood supplies, decided to encourage imports by
reducing tariffs.
Since then, the share of foreign wood products has surged to 75 per cent of
the Japanese market, of which US wood comprises 28 per cent. Together with
Canadian wood, the 38 per cent market share of North American products far
exceeds that of domestic supplies. The value of imports has doubled from
Dollars 5.36bn in 1986 to Dollars 10.89bn in 1992.
'Our campaign for the greater use of wood has benefited foreign wood
products more than domestic ones,' says Mr Motohiko Wako, vice-president of
the All Japan Federation of Lumber Associations.
Mr Wako explains that North American wood has become popular in Japan
because of lower prices and reliable quality.
Mass plantations reduce costs while the yen's rise has contributed to the
competitiveness of foreign products.
North American wood is also uniform in quality and distribution is
efficient, so that it is possible for buyers to order wood from the west
coast by phone without seeing the product. Japanese wood varies
significantly in quality, so that buyers are required to go to a lumber
market to check on quality, Mr Wako says.
A second argument is that because of environmental movements in the US and
elsewhere, Japan cannot rely on imports to supply its huge appetite for wood
products.
The US already imposes export restrictions on its wood and the Clinton
administration has announced a policy to limit logging to protect the
environment. As a result North American lumber prices have doubled since
1992.
Japan also has its environment to think about when considering how far it
can reduce tariffs. The plantation of trees prevents landslides in Japan's
mountainous terrain, ensures clean water and helps prevent global warming,
Mr Wako says.

Sir Leon Brittan, European Commissioner for external relations and trade,
warned China yesterday not to punish British companies in retaliation for a
row over Hong Kong, saying such action against any member of the European
Union was unacceptable, Reuter reports from Beijing. Sir Leon is shown above
speaking at a press conference in Beijing with Ms Wu Yi, China's minister of
foreign trade, yesterday.
Sir Leon, holding talks on subjects including Beijing's bid to re-enter
Gatt, said non-discrimination was the basis of EU trade policy.
He later told BBC radio he had had an assurance 'from the very highest level
in China' that there would be no discrimination against any EU member state
and that it was recognised that non-discrimination was a fundamental
principle of Gatt.

FT  01 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Korean mobile licence for Posco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pohang Iron and Steel (Posco) yesterday was selected to lead a consortium to
operate South Korea's second mobile telephone network. But the decision is
unlikely to end the controversy marring the project since it was announced
four years ago.
Posco competed against Kolon, a textile group, for the lucrative licence,
which was awarded by the Federation of Korean Industries (FKI), the
country's main business organisation, on behalf of the government.
Posco's leadership of the consortium is likely to raise questions about the
government's commitment to privatise the telecommunications industry since
the steelmaker's largest shareholder is the state.
The FKI explained that Posco had offered better technology and had stronger
capital resources than Kolon. It is one of the world's most profitable steel
companies.
Posco will take a 15 per cent stake in the consortium, followed by Kolon
with 14 per cent. Half of the consortium's shareholding will be distributed
among hundreds of domestic companies.
Mannesmann of Germany and Pactel of the US had backed Posco, while British
Telecom and Nynex of the US had supported Kolon.
Foreign companies have been promised a 20 per cent stake in the venture but
they must submit new bids, with those willing to transfer the most advanced
technology being favoured.
Three or four foreign telecommunications operators are expected to be
selected by the FKI after consultations with Posco. Other bidders may
include Vodafone of the UK, Hutchison Telecom of Hong Kong, and GTE of the
US.
Foreign companies bidding for a share in the consortium have privately
complained that the FKI selection has been governed by backroom dealing
among the domestic participants. 'This could emerge as a major trade issue,'
said one US official in Seoul.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Small rise in Dutch growth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
0.3 per cent in 1993, the narrowest expansion in 11 years, the government
estimated. Nonetheless, the growth surpassed recent expectations of state
and private economists of zero to 0.2 per cent expansion in GDP for last
year and far exceeded the initial projections a year ago that the Dutch
economy would contract by as much as 1.5 per cent in 1993. The economy grew
0.8 per cent in the third quarterfrom a year earlier and expanded 0.6 per
cent from the second quarter. The contraction of the economy in the fourth
quarter may lay the grounds for a possible lapse into recession early this
year, should the first-quarter GDP also contract. Cold and wet winter
weather this year compared with last year is likely to have undermined
output in the key construction sector. The will publish definitive GDP data
for the fourth quarter in April.
Eastern Germany's industrial output in December declined by 9.3 per cent
from November but was up 11.2 per cent from the year. Eastern German data
are not adjusted. November output was left unrevised at down 4.4 per cent.
Pushed by a surge in foreign trade, German plant and machinery orders rose a
real 2 per cent in January from a year earlier, the VDMA industry group
reported. Domestic orders dropped 8 per cent in January on the year, while
foreign order surged 15 per cent.
Italy's retail sales index was down 0.6 per cent in October from a year
earlier. The index covers sales from 10,000 outlets across the country. From
January to October the index rose 3.1 per cent.

The direct cost of unemployment within the European Union was Ecu210bn
(Pounds 159bn) last year, equivalent to the gross domestic product of
Belgium, according to Mr Padraig Flynn, the EU social affairs commissioner,
writes David Goodhart. Mr Flynn, speaking in London, said that while
increasing worker flexibility and reducing the cost of employment were
important aspects of job creation, simple deregulatory prescriptions could
be dangerous. 'In under-regulated labour markets you create poverty and
insecurity which is not a good basis for the development of human capital,'
he said.

The Bundesbank yesterday called for variable-rate tenders in this week's

Although surprised, analysts ruled out any substantial changes in the
so-called repo rate, at which the central bank supplies short-term liquidity
to the markets. While observers agreed that the tender would probably result
in lower rates, the extent of the decline would be marginal, and none
expected any early change in the discount lending rate, reduced to 5.25 per

<TEXT>
Hungary yesterday launched the country's Ft4bn (Pounds 25.8m) mass
privatisation programme by announcing the first four public offerings in
hotel chain Pannonia, plastics manufacturer Pannonplast, brewer Soproni
Sorgyar and food retailer Global TH, writes Nicholas Denton in Budapest. A
tranche of state shares in the national telecoms company, Matav, which
remains after the Dollars 875m sale of 30 per cent to Deutsche Telekom of
Germany and Ameritech of the US, will follow in the autumn.
Over several years Budapest expects to sell state shares in 70 companies
worth a total of Ft120bn, including holdings in MVM, the electricity
utility, and Mol, the national oil and gas company. The government aims to
broaden share ownership beyond the foreign investors and state company
managers who have dominated Hungary's four-year privatisation drive, though
it plans to offer only minority tranches in companies already managed by an
industrial investor.
While state sell-offs have helped Hungary attract a total of Dollars 7.1bn
of foreign investment, and management buy-outs have become more common in
the past year, public offerings have involved only about 25,000 retail
investors out of a population of 10m. The privatisation authorities said
that they expect to persuade hundreds of thousands of Hungarians to pay the
token Ft2000 fee to join the small shareholder programme and buy up to
Ft100,000 worth of shares on highly preferential terms.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Yeltsin sacks head of domestic intelligence: Tit-for-tat
expulsion of US diplomat reminiscent of cold war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin yesterday sacked the head of his domestic
intelligence service, apparently over the bungled attempt to stop the
amnesty of his enemies. He also presided over the first tit-for-tat
expulsion of a US diplomat under his rule.
The dismissal of Mr Nikolai Golushko as head of the domestic
counter-intelligence service, which only in December replaced the security
ministry, is the latest in a series of changes to the domestic remains of
the former KGB. He is likely to be succeeded by his deputy, Mr Sergei
Stepashin, a young former MP seen as something of a liberal.
When the Soviet Union broke up, the KGB was split up into the security
ministry and the external intelligence service. The latter, responsible for
spying on foreign countries, has not been subject to the same upheavals as
its domestic twin.
Yesterday, the External Intelligence Service's successful running of a mole
in the CIA claimed its latest victim: the expulsion of a US diplomat from
the Moscow embassy.
The Russian move, reminiscent of Cold War era tit-for-tat expulsions,
followed the expulsion of a Russian diplomat from Washington after the
arrest of Mr Aldrich Ames, accused of spying for the Soviet Union and then
Russia.
Although no explanation was provided, the domestic intelligence chief's
sacking appears to be linked to a separate domestic scandal over the amnesty
granted by parliament to Mr Yeltsin's bitterest foes.
The men were freed despite instructions from Mr Yeltsin to Mr Golushko, Mr
Victor Yerin, the interior minister, and Mr Alexei Kazannik, the
prosecutor-general, to treat the amnesty as a case of the parliament
exceeding its powers.
Mr Kazannik, who resigned at the weekend, said yesterday he had disagreed
with the objections formulated by Mr Yuri Baturin, the president's national
security adviser, that the parliament had granted a pardon, which it had no
constitutional right to do, rather than an amnesty.
In further fallout from the debacle, Mr Kazannik, a once devoted Yeltsin
supporter who criticised the amnesty and gave up his parliamentary seat for
Mr Yeltsin in the late 1980s, hit back at attacks from the presidential
entourage for alleged haste in freeing the leaders of the October coup.
He said his conscience was clear and criticised 'those who would want to use
the law as a doormat'.

the EU and Es1,200bn in low-interest loans from the European Investment
Bank. Most of the funds will be spent on transport infrastructure.
Economists estimate the aid will mobilise total private and government

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Moldova's former communist establishment took a huge lead over both
nationalists and market reformers in the war-torn country's first
parliamentary elections on Sunday, according to preliminary results.
The vote suggests Moldovans have rejected the old nationalist aspiration to
reunite their former Soviet republic with neighbouring Romania and want to
make peace with their Russian-occupied breakaway region of Trans-Dneister.
With a third of votes counted by late yesterday, the Agrarian-Democratic
Party had won 45 per cent of the vote and the pro-Russian socialist bloc 25
per cent. Counting is slow in a country of isolated villages and poor
communications.
The Agrarian party favours repairing relations with Moscow and making
concessions to the discontented Russian minority in Trans-Dneister, which
boycotted the elections. Trans-Dneister, threatened by the hopes of
Moldova's first independent government to merge with Romania, fought a
breakaway war which claimed 500 lives in 1992.
A fragile peace has held since July 1992, largely through the presence of
more than 7,000 Russian troops there.
But negotiations have stalled on a final political settlement to withdraw
the Russian troops and grant the region a special autonomous status.
While the Agrarian victory may be good for peace, however, it may seriously
damage the economy. The party, which is more agrarian than democratic,
threatens to destroy a radical economic reform experiment launched last
autumn when the government, an informal coalition of former communists and
economic reformers,asked the west for help. Moldova agreed to introduce
tight monetary policies and to cut inflation in return for financial
support. Now, however, the national bank's fastidious monetary policies,
among the most determined in eastern Europe, and a newly launched
privatisation programme may be cast aside before the reforms have a chance
to take hold.
The prime minister, Mr Andrei Sanagheli, who ran on the Agrarian ticket,
approved the reform deal, but observers say he is not ideologically
committed to it. 'There will be credit expansion and price increases,' said
a reformist economist, Mr Anatoly Gudim. 'It's inescapable.'
This spring will test the Agrarian party. To keep monetary policy in check
it will need to withstand pressure from the farm sector, which it
represents, to issue a wave of credits for planting crops. Issuing those
credits would risk losing more than Dollars 200m in International Monetary
Fund and World Bank loans. But forgoing spring planting would be
unthinkable. Agriculture accounts for some two-thirds of the economy.
The national bank governor, Mr Leonid Talmaci, who is technically
subordinate to the parliament, has said he is 'ready to resign' if
parliament orders an expansion in the money supply. 'Reducing inflation is
my most important task. I will not degrade our new currency,' he said.
The privatisation ministry, headed by Mr Vissarion Cheshuev, is under fire,
too, and he expects to be thrown out of office. The Agrarians have denounced
as illegal his plan to auction off a third of state property by the end of
the year and are calling for a complete review of the programme.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Bonn increases pressure on Elf to build refinery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The German government and privatisation authorities yesterday stepped up
pressure on Elf Aquitaine, the French energy group, to honour a contract to
build an oil refinery at Leuna, east Germany.
Failure to go ahead could cost Elf DM1.5bn (Pounds 580m) in
breach-of-contract penalties, and oblige it to give back a chain of more
than 600 east German petrol stations, warned a senior official of the
Treuhand privatisation agency.
Although a spokesman stressed Elf had not been given an ultimatum, and that
discussions were continuing, interventions by Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr
Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, underlined Bonn's anxiety.
The passing of the deadline yesterday for starting construction brought the
row to a head. Government officials confirmed Mr Kohl had written to Mr
Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, while Mr Rexrodt said the
government insisted Elf should fulfil its contractual obligations.
Mr Rexrodt said the risk of losses in the start-up phase was not enough
reason for withdrawal since Elf seemed to believe the project would be
profitable in the long term.
The French company, committed to two-thirds of the DM4.5bn construction cost
in a joint venture with the German Thyssen group, wants to cut its interest
to 35 per cent.
It is understood to have unsuccessfully asked BP, Shell and Esso to take a
stake. Thyssen has also said it will not increase its holding. 'It is
turning into a war of nerves,' one French analyst said. 'Elf has clearly
found it hard to find any takers for a stake and German patience has run
out.'
BP was one of the disappointed bidders in the July 1992 sale of the
existing, run-down Leuna refinery, which was made more attractive by the
inclusion of the profitable Minol petrol station chain, with its estimated
25 per cent share of the east German petrol market.
While the British group was prepared only to refurbish the old
11.5m-tonne-a-year refinery, Elf, in a pact with Thyssen's engineering
interests, won the day with an offer to build a new 10m tonne plant.
Mr Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand were both personally involved in
the agreement, which was hailed at the time as a triumph.
However, Mr Philippe Jaffre, Elf chairman since August who steered the group
through privatisation last month, is determined to reduce his company's
participation as part of cost-cutting measures. Elf's profits fell more than
80 per cent last year to FFr1.1bn (Pounds 120m) and Mr Jaffre plans the sale
of non-core assets and tighter financial controls on investments.
Elf said yesterday it was still seeking industrial partners, but refused to
comment on the state of negotiations or on the threats of sanctions.

FT  01 MAR 94 / German utilities announce takeover bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Germany's three largest energy utilities have announced agreement to take
over the lion's share of east Germany's power generating and coalmining
industries, in two deals valued at more than DM10bn (Pounds 3.8bn), writes
Quentin Peel.
Essen-based RWE, PreussenElektra, owned by Veba, and Munich-based Bayernwerk
will jointly own 75 per cent of Veag, the main east German electricity
company, with the remaining 25 per cent going to five smaller western
utilities. The price is around DM8bn.
The takeover of the giant Lausitz brown coal fields (Laubag), for DM2.1bn,
will involve a further DM6bn investment over 20 years, according to Mr
Friedhelm Gieske, RWE's chief executive.
The Rheinbraun subsidiary of RWE will be the 51 per cent majority
shareholder in Laubag, with PreussenElektra taking 30 per cent, and
Bayernwerk 15 per cent. RWE Energie will hold the balance.
Veag supplies some 70 per cent of east German electricity, primarily from
power stations fired by brown coal.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Fiat workers vote for deal to save jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Works councils at Fiat's Italian vehicle plants have endorsed overwhelmingly
a complex government-sponsored agreement avoiding large job losses. The deal
directly affects 16,000 of Fiat's 95,000 vehicle workforce and was brokered
by Mr Gini Giugni, the labour minister, between management and union leaders
last Monday.
The main engineering union, Fiom, insisted the agreement be put to a
shop-floor vote because Fiat's plans to cut its workforce by more than 5 per
cent and lay off a further 10 per cent had provoked serious unrest. Although
less than 60 per cent of the workforce voted, almost 90 per cent favoured
the deal in most plants.
The high numbers in favour suggested employees previously threatened with
job losses or up to two years laid off (and with an uncertain future after
that) opted for a generous package of work sharing and early retirement.
The more militant among the unions rejected the deal because they said it
funded job cuts at Fiat without any clear future industrial strategy.
The deal is based round four points: early retirement for 6,600 workers and
staff; 'solidarity contracts' covering some 3,500 jobs and affecting 8.700
people, involving a shorter working week, salary cuts and job sharing;
government subsidised retraining and job hunting for 2,200; and the
commitment to spend up to L450bn (Pounds 182m) on the development of a clean
car.
According to labour ministry estimates the agreement will cost some L310bn
more than the original package proposed by Fiat last November. Of this
L220bn will cover early retirement, split jointly between the government and
Fiat. A further L90bn covers the solidarity contracts over the next three
years.
The funds earmarked for developing a clean car include over L300bn for an
electric car. These were already in the science ministry budget.
Put together the overall cost of achieving labour peace at Fiat and allowing
the group the means to fight the recession in the automotive business over
the next three years comes close L900bn.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Fight to rescue EU enlargement talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Strenuous high-level efforts were being made early this morning to rescue
talks aimed at getting Finland, Sweden, Austria and Norway into the European
Union by next year.
Negotiators 'stopped the clock' and pressed on beyond the midnight deadline
for concluding the talks, amid clear signs that Austria and Norway were
unable to agree entry terms.
Mired in detail, the two sides were set to continue through the early hours
into today, and one EU neg-otiator warned: 'This is starting to go
backwards.'
The EU member states were faced with either settling early entry terms for
Sweden and Finland, or adjourning the negotiations for a few days before
reconvening - possibly even at a summit of heads of government.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, Germany's foreign minister, joined the negotiations
yesterday with a plea from Chancellor Helmut Kohl for flexibility on both
sides to get all four applicants into the Union. Enlargement, he said, was
much more important than arguing over a few thousand tonnes of Norwegian
fish, one of the main sticking points in the talks.
Oslo is resisting Spanish demands for access to Norwegian fishing waters, as
well as French-inspired attempts to restrict access for Norwegian fish to
the EU single market for four years.
In addition, disputes over agriculture subsidies, the newcomers'
contributions to the EU budget, and transit rights for EU lorries through
the Austrian Alps, have still to be settled.
Germany, the EU's main paymaster, also warned that enlargement was part of
the 1992 Edinburgh summit deal, which agreed the 1994-99 EU budget
resources, including a doubling of aid to poorer countries like Spain,
Portugal, Greece and Ireland.
EU diplomats disclosed that Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spanish prime minister, has
written to Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany to spell out Madrid's bottom
line. Though Spain still insists Norway cannot be allowed a better deal on
fish than the limited agreement Spain and Portugal got when they joined in
1986, Mr Gonzalez made clear he will not countenance significant change to
the EU's weighted majority voting rules to accommodate the newcomers.
Spain and the UK want to keep existing voting rules to preserve their
ability to block EU measures. Currently, 23 votes out of 76 - normally
meaning two large and one small member states - can stop legislation in the
Council of Ministers. If all four applicants enter, the 16 would share 90
votes.
A majority of the 12 want to maintain the carefully nurtured existing
balance between big and small EU club members by requiring 27 votes to block
proposals. This issue alone may need to be resolved by a summit, some EU
diplomats predicted.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Bank of Italy warns on budget deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of Italy yesterday warned of a growing budget deficit in 1994,
thanks to a deeper than expected economic recession and administrative
delays in public spending cuts.
The warning was contained in the central bank's half yearly economic report,
which was cautious on the possibility of an early recovery and predicted a
further deterioration in unemployment.
The report's publication yesterday coincided with the opening of the
campaign for the March 27 general elections and the announcement of the main
parties' economic programmes.
As such, the report is a sober reminder of the limited economic policy
options for the next government.
Behind guarded language, the central bank is attempting to hammer home the
message that the reform of Italy's public accounts by the Amato and Ciampi
governments is far from over. The implicit suggestion is that the next
government will have to introduce a mid-year mini-budget.
Such a view flies in the face of the electoral propaganda of the Forza
Italia movement of Mr Silvio Berlusconi the media magnate. Mr Berlusconi is
promising to reduce fiscal pressure and preside over an early recovery for
'a new Italian miracle'.
The report says provisional figures for last year suggest that the economy
recorded a negative growth of 0.7 per cent against the modest 0.9 per cent
increase the previous year.
Record export growth only partially offset the severe drop in domestic
demand.
For 1994, the bank says it is too early to judge whether the official growth
target of 1.6 per cent can be achieved.
The report says the 1994 budget's aim of holding the public sector deficit
to L144,000bn (Pounds 57.6bn), equivalent to 8.7 per cent of gross domestic
product, will be hard to achieve.
'The 1994 financial objectives will be complicated by lower than expected
growth in production, especially as a result of 1993, and by spending cuts
having less effect than desired because of difficulties in introducing
structural changes in a short time,' it says.

The closest vote was at Alfa's Arese plant outside Milan, believed by the

the Turin-based group the means to fight the recession in the automotive
business over the next three years comes close L900bn.
This figure also excludes the cost to the social security budget of 4,100
persons to be covered by temporary lay-offs until 1996.
With unemployment still rising it is extremely doubtful whether the next
government can afford to be so generous in offsetting job losses. Over the
weekend, Prof Mario Monti, one Italy's leading economists, was highly
critical of the Fiat package.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Serbs still believe they hold winning cards: Belgrade hopes
to exploit Russia's intervention in complex moves for peace settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia's entry into Bosnian peace moves has boosted the confidence of Serb
leaders, who believe they can shape the map, not only of Bosnia, but of all
former Yugoslavia.
President Slobodan Milosevic, who emerged almost triumphant from recent
confrontation with Nato over Sarajevo, was silent in the immediate aftermath
of the shooting down of aircraft over Bosnia yesterday. But he is using Serb
forces in a way that shows he is convinced Serbia still holds the key.
Serb officials believe Belgrade has seized control, via Moscow, of the
political agenda for helping to end the war.
Over the past week, Serbian media found every opportunity to praise
President Boris Yeltsin, formerly dubbed 'an enemy of the Serbian people and
the Orthodox world'. After supporting Mr Yeltsin's proposal for a 'great
powers' summit on Bosnia, Mr Vladislav Jovanovic, Serbian foreign minister,
even accused the west of 'being more interested in blocking the Russian
initiative than in putting forward an alternate plan'.
In this vein, Serb officials believe the US is pursuing its own agenda,
seeking to restore the Croatian-Moslem alliance so as to provide a balance
of military power in Bosnia. This could isolate the Serbs and force them to
make concessions but the gamble could backfire. 'Serbia cannot be excluded
from any peace agreement,' a UN diplomat said.
The US plan would undermine the alliance cultivated in secret between Zagreb
and Belgrade, aimed at dividing Bosnia at the expense of the Moslems. With
Croatia and Serbia about to normalise relations, there is one outstanding
issue: the status of Serb-held territory in Croatia, frozen under United
Nations supervision.
According to senior Croatian officials, Washington has promised to guarantee
return of those territories to Zagreb in exchange for Croatian backing of
the US peace plan. But in a threatening broadcast, Belgrade radio on Sunday
warned that the US moves could not only provoke clashes in Bosnia but lead
to renewed fighting in Croatia between Serbs and Croats. Mr Jovanovic
yesterday called it a 'bellicose plan', warning Zagreb to side with Belgrade
despite US pressure.
These statements reflect Mr Milosevic's belief he can derail the US
initiative and weaken his adversaries. Recent events support this view:
While Serb forces waged an offensive against the Bihac enclave in north-west
Bosnia, Bosnian Serb leaders last week in Belgrade signed a defence pact
with Mr Fikret Abdic. He is the renegade Moslem chief from the Bihac region
who is a fierce opponent of Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic. There has
been a stand-off between Serb forces and UN troops at a bridge over the
River Sava linking Serb-held territories in Croatia and Bosnia - to warn
Zagreb that local Serbs, under control of Belgrade, could make trouble.
Serb forces in the Dalmatian hinterland are poised again to destroy the
strategic Maslenica bridge, which is now operating. The bridge joins
northern Croatia with its southern Adriatic coasts.
While sceptical about prospects for a Croat-Moslem alliance, Belgrade fears
the US will use the alliance to exert pressure on Bosnian Serbs to give up
more land. This could include ceding access to the northern River Sava,
which would effectively sever the east-west corridor linking Serbia with
other Serb-held territory in western Bosnian and Croatia.
'This would result in a new round of fighting in northern Bosnia. The
Moslems would probably join with the Croats to cut the corridor. The Serbs
would fight against this tooth and nail,' argues Mr Predrag Simic, head of
the Institute for International Politics and Economy in Belgrade.
But Mr Milosevic is aware that if the war continues, the Serbs may lose
their considerable advantage over the Moslems and Croats. More war would
prolong Serbia's isolation. UN sanctions, imposed 21 months ago for
Belgrade's role in the violent partition of Bosnia, would remain in force
without a peace agreement.
But there is little doubt among Serbs that Serb-held land in Bosnia will
soon unite with Serbia proper. The question that Belgrade wants to resolve
is the future dimensions of Greater Serbia.
While watching what role the US plays, Serbian leaders are already confident
the balance of forces now involved in the peace talks has fundamentally
changed.
'Russia and the US are playing an old fashioned game called the cold war,
with Bosnia as a magnet,' says Mr Simic. While the Serb leadership awaits
Moscow's next move, the Serbs believe Russia will defend them.

FT  01 MAR 94 / French unemployment rise slows: Opposition accuses
government of undermining minimum wage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The rate of increase in France's record unemployment is slowing, but the
politics of how it is ever to be reduced is hotting up, with the Socialist
opposition and unions accusing the conservative Balladur government of
undermining the minimum wage.
Insee, the official government statistics agency, said yesterday that the
number of unemployed rose by 4,800 in January to 3.307m, leaving the overall
jobless rate at 12.2 per cent.
Mr Michel Giraud, the labour minister, said this showed a 'clear
deceleration', because for the third successive month fewer than 5,000
people had joined the dole queue, compared to monthly increases of more than
30,000 in January-June 1993 and of more than 15,000 last autumn.
Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, yesterday reacted to the January job
news in the tentative tone he always adopts in discussing this chief bugbear
of his government.
His goal of reducing unemployment in 1995, when France elects a new
president, 'is perhaps not out of reach', he said.
Mr Balladur went on to complain of 'false debates based on false
information' that he was undercutting the country's so-called Smic minimum
wage for young people. The row was sparked by last week's publication of
decrees implementing Mr Giraud's new employment law.
This allows companies to pay workers under the age of 25 less than the Smic
level, but generally requires them to spend the saving on training the young
workers.
Despite a student union's call for a protest and the threat of a further row
when the government and unions discuss employment on Thursday, Mr Giraud
said he had no intention of changing the law voted by parliament last
autumn. Nor, however, was Mr Giraud in favour of a specially low 'youth
wage' to price young workers into jobs.
This is in contrast to the more radical deregulatory views of the British
conservative government whose employment minister, Mr David Hunt, will visit
Mr Giraud in Paris this week.
French national output in the last quarter of 1993 rose by 0.2 per cent over
its level in July-September, Insee reported yesterday, showing an overall
0.7 per cent drop for 1993 in the French economy compared to 1992.

A United Nations official in Zagreb said yesterday that the no-fly zone over
Bosnia-Hercegovina had been a 'circus' since Nato aircraft began enforcing
it some 10 months ago.
The UN declared the no-fly zone on October 9, 1992. Nato aircraft started
enforcing it on April 12, 1993.
Under UN resolution 816, backed by Russia, no fixed-wing aircraft or
helicopters are allowed to fly over Bosnia without prior permission and
clearance from the UN.
The aim of the resolution, directed at Bosnian-Serb forces, Croatian
aircraft and Bosnian government helicopters, was to prevent munitions and
supplies reaching all three armies.
Bosnian Serbs began with a numerical advantage, since their air force was
inherited from the former Yugoslav army. The Bosnian-Serb air force includes
30 fixed-wing jets - 12 Galeb and Jastreb light attack aircraft, 12
ex-Yugoslav Orao fighter bombers, six Russian-made MiG-21 fighters - and 15
Gazelle helicopters.
The Bosnian army is equipped with helicopters and light aircraft, while
Croatia has four MiGs, although unconfirmed reports claim that the Croatian
air force has acquired an additional 16 MiGs.
Since the enforcement of the no-fly zone, numerous violations have taken
place.
According to UN officials in Belgrade and Zagreb, 1,397 violations were
recorded between October 1992 and January 1, 1994. They add that between
January 24 and February 17 alone, there were 152 violations, with the
Bosnian Moslems responsible for 77, the Croats for 55, and the Serbs 19.
Most of these violations were by helicopters transporting munitions and
personnel into military zones.
UN officials say that between last December 20 and January 24, the vast
majority of the 65 violations were carried out by Moslem and Croat forces,
mostly over central Bosnia.
More than 170 Nato aircraft have carried out 7,250 sorties, or fighter
missions over Bosnia. Most of the aircraft fly out from the Italian air base
of Aviano, Nato's largest base in southern Europe. The US, the Netherlands,
France, Britain,Spain and Turkey are involved in the sorties, known as
'Operation Deny Flight'.
The sorties are backed up by Awacs surveillance aircraft and fuel tankers.
Altogether, Nato has carried out 13,650 sorties over Bosnia.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Danish coalition loses its majority
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Denmark's four-party centre-left coalition government yesterday lost its
one-vote majority in the Folketing when a member of the Centre Democratic
party resigned to sit as an independent for the rest of the current
parliament.
The opposition is expected to try to exploit the change to force the
government into calling an early election. However, the dissident Centre
Democrat, Mrs Bente Juncker, has said that as long as the government sticks
to the policy programme agreed when the government was formed in January
last year she would not help to bring it down.
An election to the Folketing must be called by the prime minister, Mr Poul
Nyrup Rasmussen, the Social Democratic party leader, by December 6. Mr
Rasmussen has repeatedly said that he will postpone calling an election as
long as possible.
Mrs Juncker was appointed minister for social affairs, replacing a Social
Democratic minister, in a cabinet reshuffle on January 27. The reshuffle was
intended to strengthen the government in general and the Centre Democrats in
particular in the run-up to the election, but it went badly wrong.
Two weeks after the reshuffle Mrs Juncker was dismissed for passing on
libellous rumours to journalists concerning the head of a home for mentally
retarded adults.
Recent opinion polls suggest that the government - made up of the Social
Democrats, the Centre Democrats, the Christian People's party and the
Radical Liberals - will lose seats in an election. There is a risk that the
Centre Democrats, with nine seats, and the Christian People's party, with
four seats, will be eliminated from the Folketing altogether.
If an election result were to follow the opinion polls, Mr Rasmussen would
continue to have a good chance of forming a minority administration, but he
would have to rely on the support of the left-wing Socialist People's party.

The German Treuhand privatisation agency yesterday sealed the sale of
eastern Germany's brown coal fields and the region's largest electricity
company, writes Judy Dempsey. The sale of the Laubag lignite mines and Veag
ends a two-year attempt by the agency to sell the two companies. Laubag was
sold to a consortium, led by Rheinbraun, a subsidiary of RWE, and which
includes PreussenElektra and Bayernwerk. The consortium is expected to
invest DM6bn (Pounds 2.3bn) in the fields and to guarantee at least 10,000
jobs.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Western military alliance fires its first shots in anger:
Nato's changing role with the end of the cold war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation is universally regarded as the
world's most powerful and best organised military alliance, and is credited
with having won the cold war by its successful defence of western Europe
against the overwhelming military power of the Soviet bloc.
Yet the extraordinary fact is that its strength and resolve had never been
tested in actual combat - until yesterday Serb aircraft rushed in where
Soviet leaders from Stalin to Gorbachev had feared to tread.
The cold war is in fact a classic instance of the old Roman adage, 'if you
want peace, prepare for war'. For 40 years Nato filled the north German
plain with heavily armed combat units, patrolled the skies and sea lanes of
Europe and the north Atlantic with innumerable aircraft and ships, and
deployed nuclear weapons of various ranges aimed at Soviet and east European
targets. All these forces and equipment were honed with constant exercises,
but none of them were actually used, because the Soviet Union never
attacked.
Of course, individual members of Nato have been involved in military action
in various parts of the world, and sometimes several of them together - the
most spectacular example in recent times being the Gulf war. But those were
not Nato operations. The long experience of training and exercising together
in Nato came in very useful: forces were diverted from Nato duties, and
various Nato logistical assets such as pipelines or communications equipment
were used. But the alliance as such was not involved.
Only in the past two years has Nato begun to envisage collective action 'out
of area', that is outside the territory, waters and airspace of its member
states which it is pledged to defend. It has done so partly in search of a
post-cold war role, partly out of awareness that European security is now
threatened much more by conflicts within or between the former communist
states than by any directly hostile intentions towards Nato members.
At Oslo, in June 1992, the alliance offered its services for peacekeeping
duties to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, which was
supposed to become the main regional collective security organisation in
Europe under the UN. But events in the Balkans moved too fast for the CSCE
to get its act together, and Nato soon found itself dealing directly with
the UN, as an instrument through which various Security Council resolutions
could be implemented.
Since July 1992 a combined Nato-Western European Union taskforce has been
policing UN sanctions in the Adriatic, and since November 1992 it has had
powers to stop and search ships for this purpose. Nato has also provided the
headquarters unit of the UN protection force (Unprofor) in Bosnia.
When the Security Council imposed the no-fly zone (NFZ) in Bosnia in October
1992, Nato provided Awacs air surveillance aircraft to monitor it. On March
31, 1993, the Security Council authorised use of force against aircraft
violating the NFZ, and on April 2 the North Atlantic Council (Nato's
governing body) agreed to provide that force. As Mr Manfred Worner, Nato's
secretary-general, said at the time: 'It is the first time that this
alliance will run a military operation in practice, not in exercise. It is
the first time that this will take place out of our area. It is the first
time that it happens in support of a United Nations resolution.'
Last June Nato went further, offering 'protective air power in case of
attack against Unprofor in the performance of its overall mandate'. In
August, and again in January and February, it issued specific threats of air
strikes against Serb positions. Although these threats were subject to UN
request, they were regarded by many, and notably by the Russians, as going
beyond what the Security Council had authorised. But the shooting down,
after warning, of aircraft violating the NFZ is clearly within the letter as
well as the spirit of Security Council resolutions.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Russia backs downing of jets: Nato action prompts Moscow
peace effort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON, GEORGE GRAHAM and LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW, WASHINGTON, BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia firmly backed Nato's downing of four hostile aircraft over Bosnia
yesterday, as the Bosnian Serb leader flew to Moscow to face further
pressure to reach a peace deal.
US F-16 fighter jets blasted the Yugoslav-made Galeb light attack aircraft
with missiles to enforce the United Nations 'no-fly' zone over Bosnia. It
was Nato's first combat action since it was formed nearly 45 years ago.
The Russian foreign ministry said unequivocally that any violator of the UN
flight ban over Bosnia deserved to be punished. But Moscow, a traditional
ally of the Serbs, made a diplomatic gesture to them by noting they had not
conceded that the offending aircraft were theirs.
The unexpected trip to Moscow by Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb
leader, came just hours after the fighters were shot down.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, indicated that the urgent
talks with Mr Karadzic were an attempt to keep up the momentum of peace
efforts, including the creation of demilitarised zones.
The Russians are apparently seeking to pull off another coup, after their
intervention two weeks ago speeded Bosnian Serb withdrawal of heavy weapons
from around Sarajevo and so averted Nato air strikes.
On the same day as the Nato dogfight, Russia also indicated its willingness
to forge closer links with the western alliance.
Mr Vitaly Churkin, deputy foreign minister and special envoy to former
Yugoslavia, said Moscow would soon sign up to Nato's 'partnership for
peace', which envisages closer military co-operation with the alliance. He
was speaking after talks in Moscow with three Nato ambassadors.
Russia's endorsement of the peace plan - a week after President Boris
Yeltsin's promise of a more assertive foreign policy - lent credence to Mr
Churkin's promise that Russia was determined to conduct a foreign policy
'not aimed at worsening conflicts' but worthy of 'a great sovereign state'.
Nato secretary-general Manfred Worner said the downing of the aircraft was a
sharp lesson to show that the UN and Nato were serious. He warned the
offenders not to retaliate.
US Admiral Jeremy Boorda, Nato's commander in southern Europe, said an Awacs
surveillance aircraft had spotted six Galebs south-east of Banja Luka, the
main Serb air base in northern Bosnia. Four F-16s flew in and shot down four
Galebs after they ignored two warnings for them to land or leave Bosnian
airspace. The other two Galebs fled towards Croatia.
In its defence of Nato's action, Russia said it was in accordance with the
UN Security Council resolution passed in October 1992.
The UN resolution bans unauthorised flights by all fixed-wing aircraft and
helicopters in airspace over the republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina. Nato
declared the no-fly zone in April 1993.
In Washington, President Bill Clinton said the White House had been in touch
with Moscow 'and we have explained what happened'. Other western leaders,
including Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, who was visiting Mr Clinton,
supported the action.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Rules on public contract tendering to be eased
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Private companies will be able to win public sector contracts without having
to compete against other bidders, under government guidelines to be unveiled
today.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, will announce that
ministers have decided to drop their insistence on competition in all cases,
in an effort to get the government's private finance initiative off the
ground.
Under the guidelines, a contract will not be put out to public tender if it
cannot proceed without access to the intellectual property of the company
that came up with the proposal.
The move, recommended by the government's private finance working party, is
designed to address what has emerged as a significant obstacle to the
involvement of private capital in public sector projects.
Companies have been unwilling to commit resources to devising new proposals
since, once adopted, they are required to go to competitive tender for
implementation, allowing the innovation to be won by a competitor.
Mr Dorrell will set out a framework for handling competition in private
finance initiative contracts at an Institute of Directors seminar.
He is expected to confirm that government departments will be permitted to
offer the partial reimbursement of tendering costs if they set out the
arrangements under which this would take place before the tendering process
starts.
Companies on the government's private finance working group have also been
assured that when contracts are put out to competitive tendering the
competition will only be between three or four big companies.
This is designed to cut bureaucracy and time involved in the tendering
process.
Government departments will also clearly define public sector contracts in
order to avoid what one member of the committee called 'the chopping and
changing of government construction contracts'. Mr Dorrell will explain that
the government has decided against giving departments the right to offer
design-only contracts.
A string of conditions is expected to apply to the cases where the
competition requirement is dropped.
The proposals will not involve cases covered by European Union rules
requiring competition. Mr Dorrell's speech will come just a week after the
release of a Labour discussion paper on private financing for infrastructure
projects. He is expected to use this to argue that there is now cross-party
consensus on the benefits of private finance.
Ms Ann Robinson, head of the IoD policy unit, said yesterday: 'The private
finance initiative is at present underutilised and insufficiently attractive
to private bidders. Improvements can be made.'

FT  01 MAR 94 / Record Lautro fine for Legal &amp; General
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A widespread and systematic failure to comply with regulatory requirements
yesterday cost Legal &amp; General, one of the UK's leading life and general
insurance companies, a total of Pounds 400,000, including a record fine.
Lautro, the UK life insurance industry's self-regulating organisation,
ordered L&amp;G to pay a fine of Pounds 180,000 as well as Pounds 220,000 in
investigation costs.
The charges, which were admitted by L&amp;G, stem from its failure to keep
proper control of its direct sales agents. The charges highlight the way in
which compliance responsibilities were delegated to branch management and
staff without enough central control.
L&amp;G said yesterday it remained committed to the philosophy behind its system
 -that compliance had to be an integral part of the sales process and so was
a matter for every sales agent, but had introduced central checking of all
customer information from its sales force.
The three breaches of Lautro rules were: failing to ensure that the company
had a satisfactory compliance system; failing to ensure that sales agents
complied with Lautro's rules; and failing to keep records showing adequately
that the sales agents' duty to give the customer 'best advice' had been
fulfilled.
Lautro said the failure was 'across the board' and covered the period from
July 1991 to October 1992.
Among the concerns was that the company did not act effectively to monitor
how many policies sold lapsed early - the persistency rate. That is seen as
a significant indicator of whether people are being sold products that do
not suit them.
Although one charge included difficulties in the arrangements for handling
client money, L&amp;G said it was confident that no client money had been in
jeopardy. It said also that no instance of mis-selling had been identified.
Mr David Prosser, group chief executive, said yesterday: 'Since the problems
were identified, we have implemented significant changes to our systems with
the intention of achieving best practice standards of compliance.'

FT  01 MAR 94 / Inquiry into hedge fund risks: Central banks investigate
exposure after bond market slide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading central banks are investigating the risks to the world's financial
system posed by highly geared US hedge funds - aggressively managed pools of
private money - in the wake of recent turbulence in European bond markets.
The Bank of England is holding talks with UK clearing and merchant banks and
has sent them a questionnaire seeking a clearer picture of the risks
involved and the extent of the banks' exposure to hedge funds.
The Federal Reserve is carrying out a similar exercise in the US. A
spokesman for the central bank said it had not launched a formal study, but
was seeking information about the exposure of large US banks to hedge funds
'through informal means'.
Mr Otmar Issing, chief economist of the Bundesbank, said any new regulation
of hedge funds must be considered slowly and carefully because new
guidelines inevitably led to attempts to circumvent the rules, which must be
anticipated.
Heavy selling by US hedge funds has been a leading factor behind the steep
decline in European government bond markets in the past fortnight. That has
led to concern that some of the smaller funds might be in financial
difficulty.
Some hedge and futures funds lost as much as 25 per cent of their value in
February, according to preliminary figures from Tass Management, a fund data
base that monitors the sector.
The Bank of England's main concern is over the exposure of UK clearing and
merchant banks. It wants to know whether banks' dealings with the hedge
funds are backed by adequate collateral.
The Bank is concerned in particular about financing arrangements. Hedge
funds have been able to obtain funding from many banks at no margin,
effectively borrowing Dollars 100 against the security of Dollars 100 worth
of bonds.
The Bank of England considers that to be very risky, given the collapse in
bond prices. If a hedge fund were to fail, a lender might be left holding
bonds worth much less than the money lent.
In its questionnaire, the Bank of England asks banks:
What kind of dealings they have with hedge funds and in which areas.
How much information is provided by dealers acting on behalf of several
funds about how much each fund is buying or selling. Do banks know the names
of all funds to which they are exposed and their level of gearing?
How they view the smaller funds that might be considered one-person
operations when it comes to systems controls and back office capability.
What the characteristics of hedge funds are and whether they can be grouped
together as an industry.
On Thursday, when UK government bond prices fell by almost 3 points, the
Bank stabilised the market with gilt purchases of less than Pounds 100m. It
feared that if dealers found they were unable to sell less-liquid gilts,
they might be forced to mark down their prices. That in turn, it was feared,
might push the gilt market through 'support' levels, triggering further
selling.

FT  01 MAR 94 / Heseltine questions legal advice on Iraq arms case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday publicly
questioned the legal advice given to ministers in the Matrix Churchill case.
He told the Scott arms for Iraq inquiry he had been offered contradictory
advice by Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, on whether he should
sign public interest immunity (PII) certificates preventing disclosure of
Whitehall documents.
Last night Sir Nicholas issued a short statement saying his advice on PII
'has remained consistent'. He is planning to give evidence to the Scott
inquiry in three weeks' time.
Earlier, Mr Heseltine told the Scott inquiry that he had signed a PII
certificate extremely reluctantly, only after being advised by Sir Nicholas
that it was his duty to do so. He had also been reassured that his concerns
would be conveyed to the judge.
But following the collapse of the Matrix Churchill trial, Mr Heseltine
received further advice from Sir Nicholas that he was not duty-bound to sign
a PII in cases where revealing documents 'might be essential to ensure a
fair trial'.
Mr Heseltine said he found the apparent contradiction 'incredible' given his
strong reservations about not making documents available to the defence in
the Matrix Churchill case.
He told Lord Justice Scott: 'I certainly had the impression that (the advice
I was getting) was different . . . Ministerial discretion was being widened
in a way that I had expressly been told was not the case.'
In the Matrix Churchill trial, counsel for the prosecution, Mr Alan Moses
QC, made no reference to Mr Heseltine's worries and argued that the
documents were not relevant to the defence.
Mr Heseltine said he was in principle in favour of the need for
confidentiality to preserve working relationships between officials and
ministers and to protect intelligence services.
But he had at first refused to sign a PII certificate in the Matrix
Churchill case after a close examination of the documents involved.
They showed links between the intelligence services and Matrix Churchill
executives, and official approval of the export of machine tools to Iraq
known to be of military use. The prosecution said the businessmen had lied
to the government, and the documents were not relevant to the defence even
though they showed the executives exporting defence-related equipment with
full government knowledge.
Mr Heseltine said: 'It became apparent to me that if this series of events
were known at any stage, I would have to become engaged in a process of
non-communication. This I was not prepared to do.' He signed the certificate
only after insisting it was phrased so as to protect him from any
allegations of a cover-up.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said: 'It is hard to see
how the attorney-general can now survive. His role appears to have been to
protect the government rather than the course of justice.'
Mr Gerald Hosker, the Treasury solicitor, will give evidence to the inquiry
tomorrow.

FT  01 MAR 94 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: Strong growth in
exports helps Daewoo lift profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON

<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 4th March 1994) appeneded to this article.
Daewoo, South Korea's fourth-largest conglomerate, has reported a 56 per
cent increase in net profits to Won298bn (Dollars 368m) in 1993 on sales up
by 35 per cent to Won27,027bn.
The jump in earnings reflected strong exports of cars and electronics as the
Korean won fell against the Japanese yen.
The group's securities business also had sharply rising profits due to the
recovery of the Seoul bourse last year.
Daewoo Corporation, the group's trading and construction unit, had a 20 per
cent rise in profits to Won48.6bn because of increased shipments of exports.
Sales grew by 17 per cent to Won9,534bn.
Daewoo Electronics' profits increased by 19 per cent to Won19bn as sales
rose by 16 per cent to Won2,000bn, while Daewoo Motors cut its losses to
Won60bn from Won90bn in 1992 as exports grew by 80 per cent to 100,000
vehicles. Sales increased by 29 per cent to Won2,200bn.
The group's most profitable subsidiary is still Daewoo Shipbuilding,
although earnings declined slightly to Won200bn from Won211bn in 1992. Last
year's flat profit growth reflected sluggish orders received in 1992.
However, it recorded the largest number of orders among the world's
shipbuilders last year, indicating that earnings will increase in 1994.
Sales were unchanged at Won1,554bn.
Daewoo Heavy Industries, a machinery producer, reported a 59 per cent
increase in profits to Won16.7bn, although sales declined by 2 per cent to
Won882bn.
Daewoo Shipbuilding and Daewoo Heavy Industries are scheduled to merge this
year.
Daewoo Telecom had a profit rise of 11 per cent to Won7.3bn on 24 per cent
higher sales of Won473bn.
Orion Electric reported earnings down by 38 per cent to Won8.2bn as sales
rose by 18 per cent to Won477bn.
Daewoo Securities had the biggest profit rise among the group's main
businesses, with earnings growing by 64 per cent to Won80bn. Sales increased
by 16 per cent to Won440bn.
CORRECTION
Daewoo's group profits for 1993 were Won464bn and not Won298bn as stated in
Tuesday's edition.

FT  01 MAR 94 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: Turkish
privatisation hit by devaluation - Motor company Tofas faces more than one
challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 3rd March 1994) appended to this article.
A devaluation is just about the last thing an international share issue
wants weeks ahead of launch date. But for Tofas, the Turkish motor group,
adverse currency movements are simply the latest in a long line of problems.
The Turkish government is selling its 21 per cent stake in Tofas, in which
Fiat of Italy and the Turkish Koc group are major shareholders. Brokers
expect the issue to be at a significant discount to the market.
The international equity offering is for 20m global depositary receipts
(GDRs) and American depositary receipts and is expected to raise between
Dollars 400m-Dollars 450m. It will be followed by a smaller domestic
offering. Pricing is due to take place tomorrow.
J Henry Schroder Wagg and Lehman Brothers are joint lead managers and joint
global co-ordinators, with Daiwa, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and UBS as
co-leads. If successful, the offering could revitalise Turkey's
privatisation programme and open the way for the disposal of a range of
Turkish state monopolies in the next two years.
Tofas is Turkey's largest car producer with 25 per cent of the local market.
Total car sales grew from 118,000 in 1988 to 311,000 by 1992. Net sales were
Dollars 1.05bn in 1992, and Dollars 1.1bn for the first nine months of 1993.
But in many ways the company is an uncomfortable relic of Turkey's
protectionist past. It produces out-moded models behind high tariff
barriers, supplied by local components manufacturers in which the company is
also controlling shareholder.
Tofas is a manufacturing company with its distribution business, Turk Oto
Ticaret, separately listed on the Istanbul stock exchange. The issue
prospectus goes to lengths to dispel concerns about possible transfer
pricing between the manufacturing and distribution businesses.
Tofas is in a curious position. Once import tariffs are scrapped in line
with the customs union with the European Union in 1995, there is little to
stop Fiat importing direct from Italy instead of sinking further funds into
its Turkish subsidiary. Making matters even more precarious, the licensing
agreement with Fiat, on which Tofas is dependent for technology and design,
expires in 1997.
There are also doubts about the relationship between the Turkish government
and Fiat. The government was forced to cancel plans for a full public
listing in New York, after Fiat intervened. Both Fiat, with 42 per cent, and
Koc, with 34 per cent, were known to have reservations, particularly over
the rigorous disclosure demanded by the US Securities and Exchange
Commission.
The present international share issue is a more restricted private placement
with institutional investors, with GDRs issued in European markets. A small
amount of stock will be floated in a secondary offering in Istanbul, where
Tofas is listed.
Last month's 12 per cent devaluation of the Turkish lira has cast further
doubt over the sale. Tofas is vulnerable to currency instability since its
recent profits performance has been fuelled in large part by the
availability of easy credit. With interest rates pushed higher to defend the
currency, Turkish hire purchase costs have rocketed and consumer demand
fallen.
The currency turbulence has meant the banks are unwilling to underwrite the
Turkish offering, which is being allotted in a 'best offer' basis.
A quarter of Tofas' 8,500 workforce is being stood down for a month as part
of a production slowdown. But the company is planning to spend Dollars 500m
to increase installed capacity to 300,000 cars by the end of 1996. There are
also plans for new lines. At the same time, the industry is lobbying for a
five-year reprieve to the customs union deadline.
Reprieve or not, motor industry analysts anticipate shrinking market shares
for local car producers, reduced margins, and lower real earnings, as
imports increase.
CORRECTION
Tofas, the Turkish motor group. has a domestic market share of 45 per cent,
and not 25 per cent as reported on Tuesday.

   MANAMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Abdulla Saudi, deputy chairman, chief executive officer and president of
the Bahrain-based Arab Banking Corp, has tendered his resignation from the
bank, according to senior banking sources, AP-DJ reports from Manama.
The sources said that Mr Saudi offered his resignation to the board at a
meeting this month. However, a final decision over the resignation will not
be taken until April 3, the date of ABC's annual meeting.
The reasons for the resignation were not clear, sources said. However, it
follows the freezing, and the unfreezing shortly afterwards, by the US of
the assets of Arab Financial Services, in which ABC has a 36 per cent stake
and where Mr Saudi is chairman.
ABC is the Arab world's biggest bank with reported assets of Dollars 18.43bn
at the end of 1993. The Central Bank of Libya, Kuwait's ministry of finance
and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority each hold about a 25 per cent stake
in ABC. The remaining shares are held by private investors.
Mr Saudi declined to confirm that he had tendered his resignation.
In the banking community, he is recognised as a main force behind ABC and a
key in most of its main decisions. 'There is no management structure that
can run the bank without his presence. He is also the senior marketing
presence for the bank,' a senior banker said.
Mr Saudi has been president and chief executive of ABC since 1980.
According to the 1993-1994 Arab Banking &amp; Finance Directory, Mr Saudi has
held various banking positions with European and Middle East-based banks,
including the Libyan Central Bank and the Libyan Arab Foreign Bank. He was
born in Tripoli, Libya, in 1937, the directory says.
He holds directorships at financial institutions in Bahrain, Egypt and
Spain, some of them with companies affiliated to ABC.
Mr Saudi's resignation follows six weeks when US-denominated assets of Arab
Financial Services were frozen by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control.
It claimed that AFS, which posted total assets of Dollars 312.48m in 1992,
was 60 per cent controlled or influenced by Libyan interests. However, on
February 2, the US authority released the assets of AFS from sanctions.
The change of heart followed a trip to Washington by Mr Abdulla Saif,
governor of the Bahrain Monetary Agency, and Mr Ibrahim Abdul Karim,
Bahrain's finance and national economy minister
Bankers in Bahrain had feared that the US action against AFS was a precursor
to similar action against ABC because of ABC's close links with AFS.
According to sources, Mr Saudi also has tendered his resignation from AFS.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Rabuka wins second term in Fijian election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Sitiveni Rabuka, who led a military coup in Fiji seven years ago, is set
to be sworn in for a second term as the country's prime minister after
Fiji's week-long general election left his Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei
(SVT) party with an increased number of parliamentary seats.
The SVT won one extra seat in the election, taking its tally to 31. While
this is not a majority in the 70-seat parliament, the General Voters party,
which was the SVT's main coalition partner in the last government, took four
seats, compared with five previously. With support from a couple of
independent MPs, Mr Rabuka is expected to command a slim majority in
parliament and be in a position to govern.
In Suva, Mr Rabuka said he expected to visit President Ratu Sir Kamisese
Mara todayUnder the constitution, the president appoints the person whom he
judges to have majority support among MPs as prime minister.
The result is a severe blow for the Fijian Association, the new party formed
by SVT dissidents whose decision to vote down the 1994 budget triggered the
election. The FA won only five seats, against pre-election expectations that
it might gain a dozen. Its leader and guiding light, Mr Jovesata Kamikamica,
lost his own seat in the Tailevu constituency, which immediately raised
questions about the party's future.
Mr Rabuka first became prime minister as a result of the 1992 elections,
five years after leading two military coups which overthrew an
Indian-dominated coalition government. The 1992 election represented a
return to partial democracy in Fiji, although under the 1990 constitution,
Fijians are guaranteed 37 seats in the parliament, while the Indian
population gets only 27. Also, only about the half the islands' 760,000
population are deemed eligible to vote.
On the Indian side, the latest election results were also a triumph for Mr
Jai Ram Reddy's National Federation party (NFP), which won 20 seats, up from
14 previously. The gains came at the expense of the Fiji Labour party (FLP),
which was left with just seven seats, down from 13. The NFP favours a more
moderate approach than the FLP, although both parties are committed to an
overhaul of the racially-biased constitution.
On the fraught racial issue, Mr Rabuka said yesterday his party would this
year consider inviting Indians to join a so-called government of national
unity: 'That is still a possibility.' But he warned that no big changes
could be expected to government policies discriminating against Indians in
favour of Fijians.
The relatively clear outcome of the election may come as a relief to the
business community. The country has been operating without a budget for the
current year and there had been worries that, if the election results had
led to long coalition negotiations, the economy would be left floundering.
Some Suva residents also feared a backlash against the economically dominant
Indian community if Mr Rabuka and the SVT lost significant ground.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Company News (This Week): Return to the black after the dark
years - Philips
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On Thursday, the long-suffering shareholders in Philips, the Dutch
electronics group, will find out whether they can expect to receive a
dividend this year - for the first time since the company fell into
difficulties in 1990 and embarked on its 'Centurion' restructuring programme
under its then new president, Mr Jan Timmer.
Analysts are divided on whether Philips will resume a pay-out with the 1993
results. An immediate resumption of the last dividend of Fl 2.00 per share,
paid out of 1989 profits, will not be possible, but there may be room for
around Fl 0.50.
There is certainly no doubt that Philips will be reporting a return to
profit. The company generated an exceptional gain of Fl 1.1bn (Dollars 570m)
on the sale of its 35 per cent stake in Matsushita Electronics Corp, a joint
venture with Matsushita of Japan. This will be more than enough to reverse
the previous year's net loss of Fl 900m.
Even without the help of extraordinary items, Philips is expected to post a
net profit of Fl 500m-Fl 850m. Much will depend on whether Christmas
shoppers stocked up on consumer electronics products to help the fortunes of
the company's single biggest business. Consumer electronics is expected to
have remained loss-making in 1993, but Philips has said it hopes to reach
break-even this year.
Another big question is how many consumers have been tempted to buy the
company's two latest mass market products, the digital compact cassette
(DCC), which is designed to replace the analogue cassette and to compete
with Sony's Mini Disc system, and compact disc-interactive, a multi-media
version of the popular CD player.
Philips will be aided by the robust results expected from PolyGram, its 75
per cent-owned music and film company, reporting in London today.

Other companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Sweden's leading commercial bank, will be out
to show it is firmly back on the path to profits today, even if its 1993
figures remain in the red after the near-catastrophic losses of SKr5.4bn
(Dollars 670m)in 1992. Lower interest rates and an improving economy have
transformed the outlook after huge loan losses almost sank S-E Banken early
last year.

28 MONDAY
The root of a relationship
Britain's prime minister John Major, on a visit to the US that he hopes will
revitalise the 'special relationship', will have his first meeting with
president Bill Clinton in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, one-time home of Mr
Major's grandfather. Later in the day, they move to Washington. Bosnia and
Northern Ireland are likely to figure strongly in their discussions.
EU enlargement: Midnight is the deadline for the terms of entry of Norway,
Sweden, Finland, and Austria into the European Union to be agreed by all
sides.
Greek embargo: EU opposition to the trade embargo on the Former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia will be reiterated by UK foreign minister Douglas Hurd
at a meeting with Greek prime minister Andreas Papandreou in Athens.
Indian budget: Finance minister Manmohan Singh presents the annual budget,
which is expected to set out the government's plans for further economic
reform. Cuts in corporate taxes, reductions in import duties, and measures
to curb government borrowing are all expected.
Walvis Bay handover: Walvis Bay, Namibia's only deep-water port, which has
remained a South African military enclave since Namibian independence in
1990, is due to be handed back to the Namibian authorities.
South Africa's parliament meets in Cape Town for the last time before the
country's first all-race elections on April 27. It will rubber-stamp the
constitutional changes approved in multiparty talks last week.
Middle-East peace talks, due to reconvene today, have been thrown into
confusion following last week's massacre by an Israeli settler of
Palestinians in a mosque in Hebron on the occupied West Bank.
Scott inquiry: Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary and former
defence secretary, gives evidence to Lord Justice Scott's arms-for-Iraq
inquiry. He will be asked about why he signed a public interest immunity
certificate restricting government information being made available in the
trial of three UK businessmen arrested for illegally exporting arms to Iraq.
Romanian strike: Alfa Cartel and CNSLR-Fratia, Romania's two largest union
blocs, have called a general strike aimed at pushing the government into
agreeing the 1994 collective labour contract, speeding-up reform and
improving social security.
1 TUESDAY
S African crisis meeting
Nelson Mandela, African National Congress leader, and Chief Mangosuthu
Buthelezi, head of the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party, are due to meet in
an effort to prevent violence developing into civil war.
It will be their first meeting since constitutional negotiations deadlocked
and Chief Buthelezi said he would boycott the April elections. The chief
insists that only such a meeting of leaders can resolve the impasse.
However, past encounters between the two have yielded little.
North Korea has agreed to allow a United Nations team in today to inspect
its nuclear installations. Under the deal, North Korea will have high-level
talks with the South and the US, who will cancel their Team Spirit joint
military exercise.
Japan business survey: The Bank of Japan publishes its quarterly Tankan
survey of business confidence, the most authoritative official report on the
short-term economic outlook. It is likely to be gloomy, increasing pressure
for a cut in official interest rates, but will nevertheless be closely
watched for any glimmers of recovery.
Hungary eyes the EU: Hungarian prime minister Peter Boross visits Bonn at
the invitation of Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Hungary has spoken of applying for
European Union membership as early as July. At any rate, the two will
consider how to open the EU to more products from eastern Europe.
German strike vote: Engineering workers in the state of Lower Saxony begin
three days of voting on whether to hold their first big stoppage since 1984.
If 75 per cent vote in favour, they will down tools from March 7. But both
union (IG Metall) and employers are under growing pressure to get back to
the negotiating table before then.
Insider dealing regulations come into force in the UK, bringing the gilts,
Eurobonds and derivatives markets into the net for the first time. The
regulations, part of the Criminal Justice Act, were introduced to implement
an EC directive on insider dealing. The authorities expect the changes to
have little impact in practice and do not believe they will make successful
prosecutions any easier.
TUC rebirth: John Monks, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress for
the past six months, unveils the re-launch of Britain's flagging trade union
umbrella organisation. He has already announced the biggest shake-up of its
internal structure since the 1920s. Today he will preview a series of events
designed to show the TUC transforming itself into an effective lobbying
group for all workers.
US gun law: The Brady Gun Control Law comes into force, setting a five-day
delay when buying a handgun.
2 WEDNESDAY
Hurd faces Pergau quiz
Douglas Hurd (left), UK foreign secretary, will appear before the Commons
Select Committee on Foreign Affairs. He will be cross-
examined for 2 hours about the Pergau dam affair. Mr Hurd will be asked why
he gave approval for aid to Malaya to build of a hydro-electric dam. A top
Whitehall official later described the move as an 'abuse' of the overseas
aid budget.
He will also be asked whether the linkage of the aid offer to the sale of
Pounds 1.3bn of defence equipment to the Malaysians broke long-established
government guidelines.
Hong Kong budget: The Hong Kong government presents its annual
budget. It had forecast a deficit of HKDollars 3.36bn (USDollars 466m), but
thanks to a combination of unspent funds and higher economic growth  -
allied to rich pickings from stamp duties collected on the colony's buoyant
property and stock markets - it is now expected to reveal a surplus which
could be as high as HKDollars 20bn.
German rail link plan:
The German cabinet is due to decide whether to go ahead with the Transrapid
magnetic levitation hovertrain project. That would provide a service linking
Berlin and Hamburg with monorail trains running at up to 500kph.
UK monetary policy: Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor of the exchequer, and
Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, hold their monthly monetary
meeting. The quarter-point base rate cut following their February meeting
was poorly received by the markets. Since then, some weak economic
statistics have made the cut look better timed, but there is concern about
the possibility of a rise in interest rates.
Mozambican refugees: The United Nations high commissioner for refugees
Sadako Ogata visits Mozambique to review the plight of refugees.
Sam Wanamaker: The life of the US-born actor and director who died last year
will be celebrated at a service in Southwark Cathedral, south London. His
lifelong ambition was to build a working replica of Shakespeare's Globe
Theatre. There will be a collection to aid the reconstruction which is in
progress near the original site.
3 THURSDAY
Bundesbank council meets
The Bundesbank council meets for its routine fortnightly session, with
observers forecasting no further interest rate changes. The February 17
decision to cut the discount rate by 50 basis points to 5.25 per cent,
intended to remind the world that short-term rates were still on the way
down, had already anticipated the easing in inflation reported last week.
However, the 'special factors' which bloated money supply growth to 8.1 per
cent in December are apparently still at work, and economists suggest the
provisional numbers for January M3, due on Monday or Tuesday this week, will
be even worse.
Accountants celebrate: The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland
celebrates the 500th anniversary of the first documentation of double-entry
book-keeping today and on Friday. The Festival of Accounting in Edinburgh
brings together academics and practitioners to discuss the work of Friar
Luca Pacioli, the Venetian monk who published the basis of modern accounting
techniques in 1494.
Further events are planned in Italy later this year.
Saleroom: In certain circles, Barbra Streisand is as celebrated for her art
nouveau and art deco objets d'art as for her singing. She has spent more
than 30 years assembling one of the finest collections, including works by
Galle and Tiffany. However, it is to be sold at Christie's in New York today
and Friday because, Streisand says: 'I want to simplify my life'. The sale
should raise at least Dollars 4.5m.
The highlight is a Tiffany cobweb lamp, one of only a dozen made by the
American master, which carries an estimate of up to Dollars 1m. One of the
finest paintings by Tamara de Lempicka, 'Adam and Eve' (detail below),
should reach Dollars 800,000.
4 FRIDAY
Kravchuk visits Clinton
President Leonid Kravchuk of the Ukraine arrives in Washington for a
long-awaited official visit (to March 7). The trip was earned by assuring
President Bill Clinton that the country's nuclear arsenal would be
dismantled.
Mr Kravchuk has astonished his hosts by announcing he will not stand for
president in the June elections. Without Mr Kravchuk at the helm, Ukraine's
parliament might change its mind and retain a few weapons.
US economic data: Monthly payroll employment figures are the single best
guide to US economic trends. Today's data for February will be affected by
arctic weather in much of the country, but should show a bigger increase
than the disappointing gain of 62,000 in January.
Economists at Merrill Lynch are looking for a rise of about 150,000, in line
with the average monthly increase last year. The jobless rate, 6.7 per cent
in January, is unlikely to change much.
Cricket: South Africa play Australia in Johannesburg in the first test (to
March 8).
5-6 WEEKEND
Gulf council ponders oil
Oil ministers from the six members of the Gulf Co-operation Council,
including Saudi Arabia, meet on
Saturday. The continuing weakness of world oil prices will be top of the
agenda. The session will be the first of several meetings among oil
producers in the run-up to the March 25 meeting of the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Snow business: Alaska's 1,100-mile Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race starts on
Saturday, with the finish likely on March 16 in Nome.
Five Nations' rugby: France play England in Paris and Ireland play Scotland
in Dublin.
Moldovans vote in a referendum on independence and territorial integrity on
Sunday.
NEXT WEEK
Monday is the deadline set by General Sir Michael Rose, United Nations
commander in Bosnia, for lifting the Serb siege of Tuzla and its airport.

<TEXT>
Monday: Figures for M0, the narrowest measure of the money supply, will be
published in the UK. Growth in the 12 months to February is expected to be
5.3 per cent, remaining well above the government's 0-4 per cent monitoring
range. However, low interest rates, which have reduced the effective cost of
holding cash, are blamed for causing a jump in M0 growth.
German money supply figures for M3 are expected to be published ahead of the
Bundesbank council meeting on Thursday. Annualised growth in December was
8.1 per cent, well ahead of the target range, but was dismissed as a
'temporary disturbance' by the bank.
Tuesday: Growth in the US's fourth-quarter GDP could be revised to an even
higher rate than the annualised 5.9 per cent previously estimated. Extensive
construction activity in the Midwest, following the floods, may have pushed
the rate well over 6 per cent.
Wednesday: UK official reserves are expected to have risen by a modest
Dollars 50m in February. The Treasury will release its monthly monetary
report, to coincide with the meeting between the Chancellor and the
Governor.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Survey of Jamaica (10): Beans means the real McCoy - Blue
Mountain coffee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a story, at once apocryphal and instructive, told about Jamaican
coffee in recent years.
A neighbouring country (never named) with which Jamaica has agreements for
co-operation in agriculture, sent a team of agronomists, botanists and
climatologists to the island's Blue Mountains to study the region's coffee.
The group then went home, located mountains which appeared similar and, at
identical altitudes, tried to replicate Blue Mountain coffee. To Jamaica's
relief, the experiment failed.
Success would have brought significant gain. 'While the average price
obtained for coffee from other important producing nations, such as Colombia
and Brazil, stands at about Dollars 1.00 per pound, the Jamaican Blue
Mountain coffee fetches prices up to Dollars 10.50 per pound,' says Mr John
Pickersgill, general manager of the Coffee Industry Board, reflecting the
industry's conclusion that coffee produced on 15,000 acres in the Blue
Mountains is the best in the world.
There is not much of it, but the industry believes production can be
significantly expanded and these high prices maintained. Estimated demand
for Jamaican coffee is four times what the island is producing now. The
poorer cousins of the premium Blue Mountain variety are also doing well.
Lowland varieties - Prime Jamaican and High Mountain - command prices
averaging Dollars 5 per pound.
These prices have spawned plans for increased production - built on the
recovery of the industry after it was devastated by a hurricane which ground
its way across the island in 1988. Production of 4.5m pounds last year is
expected to reach 11m pounds by the year 2000, with earnings reaching
between Dollars 90m and Dollars 100m.
The ingredients which make Blue Mountain coffee are a very rare mixture. The
first is location: in the Blue Mountain range, the trees benefit from a
coincidence of elements such as cloud cover, rainfall, temperature and soil
types, which all determine the characteristics and flavour of the beans. Mr
Pickersgill is forecasting a fall in production for the current crop year,
which runs from August to July, because of changes in the weather.
Production is expected to be about 4m pounds because unseasonally heavy
rains came when the trees were flowering. 'There has been some disquiet in
the market because of this, but there is no cause for concern, especially
among the traditional buyers,' Mr Pickersgill says.
The traditional buyers are the Japanese, who take about 85 per cent of
Jamaica's coffee. (In the 1960s the big market for Blue Mountain coffee was
the UK, until the Jamaican industry discovered that most was being
re-exported to Japan and started direct shipments.) Japanese companies have
become important investors in Jamaica's coffee industry. There is also heavy
demand, mainly for Blue Mountain coffee, in the US which takes about 10 per
cent of the product. New markets are being encouraged in south east Asia and
western and central Europe.
The industry has had to struggle with domestic economic developments which
have affected all sectors of agriculture. Farmers seeking loans for
expansion of farms and the development of new ones cannot afford current
interest rates of more than 60 per cent, says Mr Pickersgill.
The devaluation of the Jamaican currency and high inflation have also made
inputs such as weed killers, pesticides and fertilisers very expensive for
some farmers, while transport costs are high and roads are poor.
Another nagging worry is the persistent threat, created by the high market
value of Blue Mountain coffee, of counterfeiting and misrepresentation of
the Jamaican product, with attempts to pass poorer quality varieties as
being genuinely Jamaican. This could damage the international reputation of
the Jamaican product and harm the industry.
Mr Pickersgill says: 'There have been some attempts at misrepresentation but
we have managed to reduce the incidence of this by being very vigilant - and
sometimes dictatorial.'

FT  28 FEB 94 / Survey of Jamaica (8): Earning power has dropped - The
mining industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jamaica's mining industry, traditionally tied to bauxite ore, is
contemplating a new and potentially lucrative frontier.
There are whispers in the international gold industry that the island may
contain commercially exploitable deposits. In the past six months government
officials have spoken with more than passing confidence of the impending
opening of a mine.
Companies involved in exploration in the island are not yet so sure. Orvana
Minerals of Vancouver, Canada, reported that an exploration study had
confirmed the existence of a 3.3 kilometre-long mineralised zone with
between 2m and 6m tonnes of gold bearing ore in Jamaica's central interior
region. Orvana bought the concession from BHP Minerals, the Australian-US
miner, but later concluded that the mineralised area did not contain a
commercially exploitable deposit, and that further exploration is needed.
While awaiting conclusion of these studies, the island's mining sector is
preoccupied with the impact on the bauxite industry of the soft aluminium
market. Flooding of the market by the Russian Republic, which has depressed
prices for the metal, has limited growth in mining and refining. As in other
countries, the industry also fears an adverse impact from the US decision to
reduce its strategic stockpile by selling relatively small quantities at
prices about one third of those being asked by the ore producers.
The effects on the industry of weak international demand are becoming
painfully clear.
Bauxite ore production last year was 11.2m tonnes, 0.7 per cent less than
1992, while exports of crude bauxite of 4m tonnes were 1.4 per cent less
than in 1992, according to the Jamaica Bauxite Institute. 'The absence of
strong growth in local output is a clear indication of the overall weak
position of the world aluminium industry which is suffering from a supply
demand imbalance and depressed prices,' says Mr Parris Lyew-Ayee, acting
managing director of the institute.
He adds: 'Jamaica's bauxite and alumina production, and earnings from the
industry, reflect also a high level of output of primary aluminium in all
the producing countries, especially by the members of the former Soviet
Union, and the reluctance of producers to curtail production to correct the
oversupply.'
The economy is feeling the effects in a decline in the industry's earnings.
These fell to Dollars 529m last year, down 8.3 per cent on the 1992
earnings, and about Dollars 200m less than in 1991. Under agreements with
miners and refiners operating in the island, earnings from bauxite and
alumina are pegged to the international prices for aluminium.
Earnings have also been depressed by a steady depreciation of the Jamaican
dollar, with mining and refining companies spending less to meet local
costs. Conventional wisdom holds that the industry is going through another
of its cycles of slump and recovery, and that prices and demand will harden
when the market stabilises, but there is increasing concern in the industry
that it could suffer longer term if miners and refiners are forced to
reconsider a Dollars 500m investment programme planned for the next seven
years.
As the world's third largest producer of bauxite ore, after Australia and
Guinea, Jamaica has proven reserves which will last 200 years at current
rates of recovery. Much is to be gained economically by getting out and
selling as much of the ore as possible.
According to Mr Carlton Davis, chairman of the Bauxite Institute, there is a
conscious attempt to export less and refine more, allowing the economy to
benefit from the value added in refining. 'The current state of the market
might lead some companies to reconsider their capital programmes, but in
times like these one prepares to meet an upturn in the market.'
The aim of the Jamaican industry is to lift refinery capacity to 5m tonnes
per year by the year 2000. The Jamalco refinery in central Jamaica, owned
jointly by the island's government and the Aluminum Company of America, is
being expanded to a rated capacity of 1m tonnes per year at a cost of about
Dollars 60m. The refinery is producing 700,000 tonnes per year, but there
are already plans of further expansion which could lift its capacity to 2m
tonnes per year.
Alumina Partners of Jamaica, owned by Kaiser of the US and Hydro Aluminum of
Norway, is spending Dollars 200m to increase the output from the island's
largest refinery to 1.5m tonnes per year - and then to 2m tonnes by the turn
of the century.
Two refineries operated by Alcan of Canada, with a combined capacity of 1.1m
tonnes per year, are being refurbished to lift output to 1.5m tonnes.
Mr Davis says that the plants could be further expanded to produce 2m tonnes
per year, using a grade of ore which was not yet being processed by the
company. While there is optimism that the state of the industry will not
adversely affect these expansion plans, two ventures have been reconsidered.
The governments of Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago had been discussing the
construction of an aluminium smelter in Trinidad, using a 'modular' system,
starting with a small plant and enlarging in stages to meet market demand.
Both governments were considering starting with a 'module' of 55,000 tonnes
per year. This project is not now being given priority because of the state
of the market, and uncertainty over the cost of the local natural gas which
would fuel the plant.
The industry's plans also included the construction of a caustic soda plant
to reduce the reliance on imports to meet part of the demand for 300,000
tonnes per year for the refineries. The project for a 50,000 tonnes per year
plant has been set back, Mr Davis says, because of a significant drop in
world prices of caustic soda.
But there seems to be sufficient confidence in the industry that the
recovery will come, and that when it does, Jamaica should be ready to take
advantage of firmer prices and new markets.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Survey of Jamaica (11): Caribbean competition - Tourism is a
sunny spot in the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tourism has been a bright spot in the Jamaican economy. With the markets
weak for its traditional exports - bauxite, bananas and sugar - growing
foreign exchange receipts from tourism have been an increasingly important
source of foreign exchange.
The industry generates close to Dollars 1bn a year in gross foreign exchange
receipts, according to government estimates. The estimated net receipts of
between Dollars 500m and Dollars 600m make it the single most important
source of foreign exchange in the economy. It employs about 26,000 people,
more than double the level of 10 years ago. Some 1.6m tourists arrived in
the country last year, 3.4 per cent up on 1992. The number of visitors
stopping over jumped 7.7 per cent to 979,000, while the number of arrivals
on cruise ships slipped 3.1 per cent to 630,000.
The tourism recovery came after two weak years at the end of the 1980s, and
difficult times for international tourism worldwide at the time of the Gulf
War and in the depths of the US recession. In Jamaica, it underlined the
heavy dependence on the US market.
According to Ms Camille Needham, general manager of the Jamaican Hotels and
Tourist Association: 'The US recession had a powerful effect that in fact
did us a lot of good. We decided that we could not have all our eggs in one
basket.'
At times in the 1980s, visitors from the US accounted for more than
three-quarters of all tourists making stopovers coming from the US. Visitors
from Canada accounted for a further 15 per cent. In 1992, 61.9 per cent of
visitors were from the US, 11.1 per cent from Canada.
The proportion of visitors from Europe has risen above 20 per cent; more
than half come from the UK, encouraged by the development of the charter
tour business. Numbers of visitors from regions such as Latin America and
Japan have also grown. Along with this, the seasonality of the trade has
been reduced. Most Europeans - unlike many holidaymakers from the northern
US and Canada - vacation in the summer months.
Jamaica's tourism business is not without its problems. Rising crime levels
(attacks on tourists have grown and two have been murdered in the country in
the last two years) attract bad publicity, which may deter visitors if the
situation becomes worse.
Some of the country's infrastructure - for example, the telephones and the
provision of electricity - has improved. But much remains inadequate.
'We have to improve the roads, reduce the number of potholes. Electricity
and telephone services have improved a lot. We are working on the water
situation but it's moving a bit more slowly,' says Ms Needham.
Part of the problem is that infrastructure has not kept up with the growth
of the industry. Much of the development has been haphazard and resorts have
not been planned. 'We have to think of planning and zoning to make the
resorts more interesting and attractive,' she says.
Other problems - such as air access to the region - are less under Jamaican
control. The future of Air Jamaica, the national airline, is uncertain. Mr
Omar Davies, the finance minister, says the government will stop providing
funds for the loss-making airline from the start of the new fiscal year in
April. Pan-American and Eastern airlines, which were the main carriers from
North America to the Caribbean, have collapsed, although American Airlines
has scheduled additional flights.
Furthermore, competition is becoming intense, and may become more so.
Several US states have started promoting themselves as holiday destinations.
Resorts in the Dominican Republic and Cancun in Mexico offer competitively
priced vacations. Cuba is attracting substantial hotel investment. Cuba
seems to offer an important medium-term threat, although its emergence as a
true competitor will depend on the lifting of the US embargo. Of all the
Caribbean islands, Cuba appears to offer most of what Jamaica has in sand,
sea and scenery.
'We can't compete with rates offered by Dominican Republic,' says one
Jamaican tourism official. 'We can't sell our rooms for Dollars 20-Dollars
30 a night.'
Despite this competition, there has been more of a co-operative approach to
Caribbean tourism in recent years. Once fiercely competitive, the resort
countries including Jamaica have implemented a big advertising programme in
the US to market the region as a single destination to potential north
American visitors. The tourist authorities hope that one spin-off may be the
development of more multi-centre holidays.
In common with other cruise ship destinations, there have been concerns in
Jamaica that cruise visitors do not provide enough benefit to the local
economy. However, a decision to increase the cruise ship passenger tax from
Dollars 10 to Dollars 15 has been delayed, apparently following pressure
from the cruise ship owners. Government officials have said that the
increase would be implemented over three years from January 1994.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Survey of Jamaica (9): Cavalry troop of one - Gordon
Stewart: business man who saved the JDollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the Jamaican dollar was slipping (by 33 per cent) in the second half of
last year, many people thought of Mr Gordon Stewart, one of the island's
leading businessmen. Would he do it again?
In the event, Mr Stewart did not. Furthermore, by all indications, he will
not. 'Although I am still concerned about the effects of this on the
economy, the last one was a very expensive exercise for me,' he says.
Just under a year ago Mr Stewart was being credited with engineering
revaluation of the Jamaican dollar single-handed, after it had slipped
significantly. He was at once thanked by Jamaican consumers and pilloried by
some in financial services.
The government's deregulation of the foreign exchange market in late 1991
was followed by a depreciation of the currency. Each day's breakfast
newscasts offered consumers an unpalatable diet of increasing prices. The
deregulation was part of a wider programme of economic liberalisation - but
it was accompanied by billowing inflation, eased only temporarily when the
government's measures to reduce liquidity brought fleeting stability.
A central bank whose reserves had long before been depleted could not
intervene to protect the exchange rate. Some parts of the business sector
accused commercial banks of fuelling the depreciation by offering
increasingly higher rates for foreign currency. There was mounting
scepticism of the government's move towards a free market economy and the
levels of inflation led many to speculate on the increasingly likelihood of
social unrest.
'I feared social unrest, not only because it would first affect tourism in
which I am involved, but also because it would seriously damage the entire
country at a time when it could least afford it,' Mr Stewart says.
In a move which took the financial market by surprise, he announced that he
would offer for sale to the commercial banks USDollars 1m per week at a rate
a few points lower than that at which the market was operating, and would be
making subsequent sales of foreign currency at still lower rates.
'The government deregulated the foreign exchange market without any reserves
in the central bank and the system got out of control,' Mr Stewart explains.
'Because the central bank could do nothing, it was left to the private
sector. We were worried because the credibility of the private sector was
being questioned, particularly that of the commercial banks, because of
apparent helplessness in stemming the slide.'
Mr Stewart's intervention had an immediate effect. Even before he had
actually sold any, there was a significant increase in the volume of foreign
currency sold to the commercial banks. People holding hard currency unloaded
it, contributing to the very revaluation which they feared. Hoteliers and
companies in other sectors of the economy offered to sell their hard
currency at less than the going rate. The result was a revaluation of 36 per
cent.
'The money we used to influence the exchange rate was no more than the hook
which one normally uses in a marketing plan,' Mr Stewart says. 'It was
important to stop the decline and to try to revalue the Jamaican dollar. I
felt the speculators were going overboard under the liberalised financial
market because all balances and checks were removed.'
Mr Stewart, now 52, heads the ATL Group, a diverse conglomerate whose
interests range from a hotel chain, through coffee farming to a motor
vehicle dealership. Leaving a job with a local trading company, he started
the group in 1968, and expanded it significantly 13 years later when he
established a chain of all inclusive hotels, six in Jamaica and three others
in Antigua, Barbados and St Lucia.
While the revaluation which followed his intervention was welcomed by the
government and some in the business community, Mr Stewart has not been
without some criticism. He has been accused of using his wealth to
manipulate what has been a free market. He rejects this, claiming that he,
and others who followed him, were free, in a free market, to set their own
price in any transaction.
The intervention was 'an act of enlightened self interest.' he says. 'At
that time I saw it as an opportunity which would allow the government to do
the right thing. It worked well until the government opened the floodgates,
and the last budget closed the door on a lot of things. Another intervention
can be made, but its effect will be temporary - I am still concerned about
the effects of all this on the economy.'

FT  28 FEB 94 / Survey of Jamaica (7): Banana suppliers battle it out -
Agriculture is waking up to the challenge of international deregulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jamaica's main agricultural exports, which have been the beneficiaries of
preferential markets, are waking up to new challenges, and some dangers,
from a changing international environment.
The increasing deregulation of international trade and the progressive
dismantling of preferences, the new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(Gatt), the planned World Trade Organisation, the emergence of a single
European market and the implementation of the North American Free Trade
Agreement have all forced the island's sugar and banana sectors to prepare
for changes which could affect protected markets.
The serious threat is to the banana market in the European Union. Jamaica,
and other traditional suppliers to the European market, are locked in a
protracted and bitter dispute with Latin American producers who want a
bigger share of the market. The Latin producers have attacked the EU's
banana import regime, which was implemented in July of last year.
The EU's new banana import regime imposes a 2m tonne per year quota for
Latin American fruit. The imports attract duty of Ecu100 per tonne. Imports
above this level will attract a duty of Ecu850 per tonne. Jamaican and other
traditional suppliers, such as others in the Caribbean and those in Africa,
will have access for the remainder of the EU's needs of about 1.5m tonnes
per year.
This fruit will pay no tariff. Jamaica's share of this is 105,000 tonnes,
which the industry intends to meet in 1995, says Mr Marshall Hall, chief
executive of the Jamaica Producers Group, which oversees the island's banana
production. This volume of exports, if achieved, will represent a
significant recovery for an industry which has been set back several times
over the past 15 years by poor weather.
Last year the industry did not achieve its export target of 80,000 tonnes,
but was marginally above the 76,500 tonnes of 1992. From average exports of
150,000 tonnes in the 1960s, the industry declined in the 1970s; exports
averaged 75,000 tonnes per year. A hurricane in 1980 and another in 1988
depressed exports in the 1980s to an average of 35,000 per year.
'So the 77,000 tonnes of 1993 indicates that the industry is back to the
levels of production of the 1970s,' says Mr Hall. 'This recovery has also
taken place with lower acreages but with higher yields. But earnings in 1993
were about six per cent less than those of 1992 because of the fall of the
pound sterling against the US dollar.'
The improvements in the industry are also reflected in higher yields. Three
big farms now produce about 70 per cent of fruit exported; productivity has
risen over the past 15 years from an average of three export tonnes per acre
to nine per acre.
But the banana exporters continue to look carefully at Gatt reaction to
repeated challenges by Latin Americans to the European import regime. An
open market in Europe would give the advantage to the more cost-efficient
Latin producers and threaten viability of the Jamaican industry.
The sugar industry's preferential market in the EU is under no immediate
threat, but there are latent concerns in the industry that this could
change. On an open market, the industry would be uncompetitive. From peak
production of just over half a million tonnes in the 1960s, Jamaica's sugar
output has declined steadily. Last year's production was 225,000 tonnes. The
industry's target is 260,000 tonnes per year to meet its guaranteed markets
 -126,000 tonnes to the EU, 116,000 tonnes for domestic consumption and
15,000 tonnes for the US market. Production costs in Jamaica are about 19 US
cents per pound, higher than world market prices. The industry survives only
because the EU market pays 23 US cents per pound and the US pays 21.7 cents.
The sugar industry is preparing for change. The government recently sold
four of five state-owned mills to local and foreign investors who have
promised to refurbish the plants and increase production. The investors
spent Dollars 43.8m for mills with a cumulative rated capacity of 270,000
tonnes per year. Tate and Lyle of the UK is in one consortium which bought
three of the mills.
The government says state-owned cane farms will be divested over the next
two years. Proceeds from the sale of the mills will be used by the
government to settle the industry's outstanding obligations, including the
repayment of Dollars 16m to the World Bank and Dollars 13.5m for redundancy
payments to workers. Government officials say they hope that the new owners'
improvements to the mills will lift Jamaica's sugar production in two years
to about 350,000 tonnes per year. And they hope divestment of the mills will
make Jamaica's industry more competitive by reducing production costs by
about one third.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Survey of Jamaica (6): Correction became a crash - Stock
values have lost 60 per cent since 1992
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jamaica's rampaging bull has been harnessed and reduced to a troubled and
uncertain bear. Wounded investors are still trying to come to terms with the
behaviour of the stock exchange. In 1992 it was the fastest growing in the
world in 1992. Since then it has lost 60 per cent of its value.
While brokers say the correction was inevitable, not many anticipated such a
crash. The traded companies have remained profitable, but the market was
affected by a coincidence of economic and political developments which have
left it winded.
The volume of business in 1992 pushed the index to a record high of
25,975.88 at the end of that year. The growth continued into January and
February of last year. Transactions in January last year totaled JDollars
1.4bn when market capitalisation reached JDollars 99bn. Inevitably, the
bubble had to burst, says Mr Wain Iton, general manager of the exchange.
'The market could not have continued at the rate it grew in 1991 and 1992,
but not many investors realised this. Average price appreciation in 1991 and
1992 was 110 per cent.'
A survey of the world's stock markets in January 1993 found that Jamaica's -
with an increase of 218 per cent in share prices - was the fastest growing,
ahead of Peru and China, says Mr Iton. Brokers and investors discounted the
first warning signs of what they expected to be a moderate correction.
But the slide gathered speed: between January and December the index moved
from 32,421.71 to 13,099.68. 'The companies were making profits, and are
still making profits, so the change had nothing to do with the performance
of the listed companies,' Mr Iton says.
He and brokers and economists have blamed the contraction of the market on
several other factors. The financial sector was troubled by reports of
irregularities in the central bank's foreign exchange operations, followed
by uncertainty, with indications that the prime minister was planning an
early election - called in March of last year.
This was accompanied by concerns about possible changes in economic policy
if the government was changed. The incumbent People's National Party
retained office, but the 1993 budget was delayed, amid persistent reports
that the government planned to impose taxes on capital gains.
The main cause of the slump in the market, says Mr Basil Buck, chief
executive of Buck Securities, one of the island's leading brokers, has been
the government's decision to pursue a high interest rate policy as part of
its efforts to curb demand and ease pressure on the exchange rate of the
Jamaican dollar. Investors jumped from the stock market into government
paper which offered interest rates of just over 50 per cent. 'Investors will
go back to the market only when there is an end to the high interest rate
policy,' says Mr Buck.
'High yields in fixed investments have become the alternative to the stock
exchange,' said Mr Iton. 'The fixed investments to which investors are
turning are risk-free, and the interest rates which are offered are
currently about 50 per cent.'
There has been some debate about the interpretation of what happened to the
market. 'The stock market crashed,' says Mr Bruce Golding, the shadow
finance minister.
His conclusion is shared by Mr Buck. 'Like every bull market there had to be
a correction, but a correction is usually between 10 per cent and 15 per
cent. This market self-destructed.'
'Some have referred to what happened as a crash,' argues Mr Iton. 'Clearly,
the decline has been of crash proportions, as the market lost 60 per cent of
its peak of January 1993. But while the decline has been continuous, the
market is still there.'
It is unlikely that the market, if and when it recovers, will experience the
levels and rates of growth of 1992. Investors will be more cautious -
inevitably, more sceptical of bullish tendencies, and react more quickly to
signs of a bear market. 'The market will improve later this year as
stability is achieved and interest rates come down and investors look for
outlets,' says Mr Paul Chen-Young, head of the Eagle Financial Network, a
financial services conglomerate which includes stock broking. 'It will take
time, however, before they get into long term investments, especially as
there is no bond market because of high inflation and high interest rates.'
These have to be supported by other changes in the economy, says Mr Iton.
Any recovery in the market will depend on the success of the government's
policies in containing inflation and stabilising the exchange rate.
'Stability in inflation and the exchange rate will support the fact that
companies are still making profits,' he says.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Survey of Jamaica (5): System seems short on credibility - A
look at a political scene ripe for revision and reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The ties that have bound Jamaicans to their political parties over half a
century are loosening and the bitter ideological debates that divided the
parties are now past. What is left is a battle for the new floating voters,
and a widespread sense that Jamaica's political system and its politicians
have not served it well.
While the antipathy towards politics is not unique to Jamaica, it is
recognised even by politicians themselves and has driven forward a proposed
revision of the country's 1962 constitution.
'The way parliament is structured and the system of voting together mean
that our system lacks credibility completely,' says Mr Edward Seaga of the
opposition Jamaica Labour Party (JLP).
The collapse of the socialist economies has been followed in Jamaica by a
migration by the governing People's National Party (PNP) across the
ideological spectrum - a shift led by Mr Michael Manley, who as prime
minister in the 1970s tried to move the country towards socialism.
After winning power in 1989, Mr Manley handed over power to his successor,
Mr Percival Patterson, who himself won a landslide victory against the JLP
last March. The PNP took 52 of the 60 seats in Jamaica's lower house, the
margin of victory exaggerated by the Westminster style first-past-the-post
voting system.
In the election, some 11 people were killed in the political violence that
has marred Jamaican elections for 30 years or more. In the worst year of
election violence, 1980, some 800 people were killed as rival party
supporters battled each other.
Many voters' entrenched positions have softened over the years as a result
of social and economic changes. In one sense, government has become less
important. Deregulation and liberalisation have reduced the government's
role in the economy. Budget stringency has meant that the powers of
political patronage which tied many voters to parties have weakened.
Mr Brian Meeks, lecturer in government at the University of the West Indies,
says that other factors include the weakening of the family, through which
party loyalty was traditionally passed. The growth of remittances from
Jamaicans living abroad has reduced the importance of the local economy to
some voters. To others living in some areas of the capital, loyalty to a
politician has been replaced by loyalties to a local gang leader or Don.
'Politicians can't afford to finance criminals . . . Criminal elements are
now linked to drugs and no longer hold on to the coat-tails of politicians,'
says Mr Bruce Golding, chairman of the JLP. The prime minister says: 'The
analysis of the available evidence establishes clearly that politics is a
decreasing factor in the present level of crime and violence.'
However, the perception that some politicians and criminals are closely
linked - or were linked in the past - has led to questions about whether the
political will exists to tackle the issue.
Crime is not the only concern of voters, who have seen successive
governments fail to raise living standards beyond the levels of 15 years ago
and who are frightened by inflation.
The constitutional revision is part of an effort to reassure voters that
things can work better, although it is far from clear that the electorate is
engaged in what some see as an arcane debate among politicians.
The Jamaican system is even more centralised than the Westminster system on
which is was modelled. The prospect of a revolt by the government's
backbenchers' revolt is so remote there is no need for party whips -
although a rebellion in the opposition JLP tried to unseat Mr Seaga as its
leader. The prime minister has enormous power of patronage (far exceeding
his counterpart in London).
There are therefore few, if any, effective checks and balances on the power
of the prime minister. 'There is absolutely no gridlock in our system. We
have a smooth highway that leads straight to an authoritarian prime
minister. We need a bit more gridlock,' says Mr Meeks of the University of
the West Indies. Nonetheless, Mr Golding is among a number of politicians
who believe that fear of a legislative gridlock will leave the system still
modelled on Westminster even after the constitution is revised.
A revision will probably establish a charter of rights for citizens. Among
likely changes is the appointment of an advocate general who will seek to
uphold citizens' rights against the government, on the assumption that the
current position of attorney general is too beholden to the government of
the day.
It may also change the size and composition of the Senate. The Upper House
is currently appointed: 13 members by the governing party; eight by the
leader of the opposition - a split meant to ensure that the two-thirds
majority needed for important constitutional changes requires a measure of
cross-party support. The most likely change will enlarge the Senate to 31
members and provide for it to be directly elected through proportional
representation.
Some provisions - such as the replacement of the Queen as head of state -
must be backed by a referendum, as well as a two-thirds majority of both
houses.
Mr Patterson says that constitutional change would not have to be voted upon
in one block. A joint committee of both houses will first have to decide on
what changes should be proposed: it could issue a set of interim proposals
before the final recommendation are issued.
Some provisions would only require a simple majority in parliament to be
changed, while others - so-called entrenched provisions - require a bill to
be laid before the house for six months before votes requiring two-thirds
majorities in both houses. The so-called deeply entrenched provisions -
which includes changing the head of state - would additionally require a
referendum.
Getting agreement between the two parties on constitutional reform is
complicated by a controversy over election procedures. The government has
promised there will be no further national elections until the electoral
system - including a clean up of electoral lists and better checks on double
voting - is improved. Local government elections due last year have already
been postponed and may have to be put back further.
However, the JLP says it wants such changes in place before by-elections are
held and is boycotting elections until changes are made. As an illustration
of some of the problems, in the last by-election - for a seat vacated to
allow the new finance minister Mr Omar Davies to take up his cabinet
position - 99.8 per cent of votes counted were cast for the ruling party. At
some polling stations, the vote for the PNP was over 100 per cent.
Whatever happens, when the next election comes around - it can be held as
late as March 1997 but is more likely to be in 1995 or 1996 - Mr Seaga is
likely to be competing as leader of the opposition.
He says the struggle for the leadership of the party by the so-called Gang
of Five did hurt the JLP, but has 'now purged' the system. Asked if it will
be he who leads the party to the next election, he said: 'It looks like it.'
Observers of the Jamaican political scene believe Mr Seaga has his eye on
history. Like his rival Michael Manley, he would like to bow out of a long
political career as prime minister, bequeathing leadership of the party and
government to an anointed successor, probably Mr Golding.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Survey of Jamaica (4): Monetary brakes applied - Finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government deregulation has changed the shape of Jamaica's financial system,
and made it a growing sector of an overall sluggish economy.
Rapid inflation has reinforced the trend. But the shift last year to high
real interest rates has been making the environment tougher for many
financial institutions.
Even before the government applied the monetary brakes, slow growth in the
economy as a whole was taking its toll and competition was intensifying. The
financial sector grew only 4.2 per cent in 1992, the last year for which
figures are available, after double digit growth every year since 1987.
Financial services grew because of liberalisation of the Jamaican economy,
which started as long ago as 1986. Growth in the early years was
spectacular. 'Now that the market is becoming less protected and more
competitive, margins are narrowing,' says Mr Delroy Lindsay, chairman and
chief executive of the Corporate Group, a financial holding company.
For banks, in particular, times have got tougher. Mr Charles Ross, executive
director of Private Sector Organisation of Jamaica, says: 'High interest
rates have put the financial system under a fair amount of strain. Banks
have been accustomed to a fairly accommodating stance from the Bank of
Jamaica. Now with penal interest rates on overdrafts at the Bank of Jamaica
 -on overdrafts for over three days, rates are 120 per cent - they have to
manage their liquidity very closely.'
Mr Jacques Bussieres, the Canadian governor of the central bank, says the
Bank of Jamaica has been slightly more accommodating since the new year, but
with nominal interest rates still above 50 per cent, there is little real
evidence that pressure is easing.
Bankers admit that high interest rates put pressure on some of their
borrowers, but there is no sense that any bank is in trouble. The Bank of
Jamaica's powers of regulation and supervision were substantially increased
under a law passed in December 1992.
Banks have been helped by the very generous margins which have provided a
cushion for these harder times. They have also been assisted, says Mr Paul
Chen-Young, executive chairman of the Eagle Merchant Bank group of 16
companies, by those savers slow in moving their funds out of low-yielding
savings accounts. Banks are paying 15-18 per cent on savings deposits with
inflation at 30 per cent and treasury bills at 50-52 per cent. There is some
JDollars 17bn in such savings accounts, which, in effect, means a transfer
of resources to banks from individual savers of about JDollars 2.5bn a year.
But there is a widespread view that further mergers in the banking system
are likely.
The merger of the largest bank, National Commercial, and the third largest,
Mutual Security, may have set this trend under way. 'Eleven commercial banks
and 40 merchant banks seems a bit excessive for a country with 2.5m people,'
says Mr Lindsay. Nonetheless, the large Jamaican population overseas, which
remits home (it is estimated) anywhere between Dollars 250m and Dollars 400m
a year, may help sustain a larger financial system than would otherwise be
warranted.
Overseas and foreign currency business is becoming an increasingly important
part of the business of Jamaican financial services companies. Since the
liberalisation of the foreign exchange laws, funds held in foreign currency
accounts in Jamaican banks have grown to USDollars 500m. Many of these
accounts - paying interest rates of 6 to 8 per cent - are held by Jamaicans
resident in the US. There are, says Mr Chen-Young, 'a lot of Miami
addresses' on these accounts.
Having access to dollars allows the banks to provide trade finance without
having to obtain lines of credit from overseas, and permits direct lending
to exporters in dollars. The banks have had to place 25 per cent (now coming
down to 22 per cent) of these funds on deposit with the central bank, a
factor which has helped the country's net international reserves to turn
positive for the first time in years.
To encourage longer term flows, the central bank has decided that foreign
currency deposits of longer than 366 days will not attract reserves
requirements.
The moves overseas by financial groups have been helped by an improving
perception of Jamaican risk in the international financial market.
Whereas Jamaican commercial bank debt traded around 35 per cent of face
value in 1987, it now trades at over 80 per cent in the secondary market.
A commercial paper market is growing which, if it continues, will tend to
deprive banks of some better quality borrowers. A housing finance market is
in place, although high interest rates obviously deter borrowers. The
insurance business is growing, although stagnation in the economy has meant
that the pension fund business has been slow.
Yet while mechanisms are in place to provide long term finance in local
currency and to underwrite share issues, it will not do so again until
inflation falls substantially - along with interest rates.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Survey of Jamaica (3): 'Inflation is the dragon we have to
slay' - Bankers and business leaders want the government to go further in
de-regulating the economy
</HEADLINE>

Mr Omar Davies, Jamaica's finance minister, is haunted by two dragons:
inflation and a depreciating currency.
'Inflation is the one which we have to slay, and once we do that, stability
in the exchange rate will follow,' says the minister. 'The tools I have are
blunt and powerful, but not many - monetary policy, fiscal policy and moral
suasion - but the last works only if the first two are shown to be working.'
Using a blunt instrument to knock the wayward and truculent economy into
shape is not considered the best policy by bankers and business leaders, who
argue that the government must go further in deregulating the economy,
creating a totally free market and the stability which business needs for
proper planning. This, runs one argument, would defeat the currency
arbitrageur - another enemy the government thinks it can do without.
The government is also concerned about the impact of inflation on its
political stock. Steadily rising prices are unpopular and a progressive
decline in real income erodes political support. But currency depreciation
is not new to Jamaicans. The Jamaican dollar fell by 67 per cent in the
1980s - and by 83 per cent since. The latest fall would not have been so
precipitous, argues Mr Edward Seaga, the opposition leader, had not the
government moved too hastily in deregulating the foreign currency markets
two years ago.
'The government has continued with the deregulation which was in progress
when we left office in 1989, but this has not been properly handled,' he
says. 'We did not intend to lift exchange controls until there were adequate
reserves to defend the exchange rate. The government did it too early and
this accelerated the depreciation of the currency.'
One of Mr Davies's instruments has been the use of attractively priced
government paper, which pays just over 50 per cent, to mop up liquidity.
This has sent up commercial interest rates to between 60 per cent and 70 per
cent.
At the same time the government wants manufacturers to produce for export,
to increase hard currency earnings. But the manufacturers say they cannot
expand with such expensive money. It is a better risk to buy the
government's fixed instruments. 'To say that this is a circle, vicious or
otherwise, is putting it too highly,' a leading businessman cynically
remarks. 'It is more like a dog chasing its tail.'
Other assessments are kinder. Jamaican business has been bruised by
government policies over the past 10 years - and Mr Charles Ross, executive
director of the Private Sector Organisation, argues that there is one aspect
of government policy which must be changed now. While the general direction
of the government's economic policy is correct, he says, there is a need for
greater fiscal prudence and an end to budget deficits.
Mr Davies says the administration is on the way towards a fiscal surplus of
just under 2 per cent of GDP for this year. Inevitably, much will turn on
the performance of the important sectors of the economy.
The three main pillars have been experiencing mixed fortunes. Tourism has
managed to cope with the uncertainties of the international economic
environment and has been growing steadily. Production of bauxite and alumina
has been stagnant because of weak demand for aluminium, and low metal prices
have cost the island's economy about Dollars 300m in earnings over the past
three years.
Of the main agricultural commodity exports, bananas have been improving, but
the industry is threatened by a disruption of its lucrative European market.
Sugar production has not risen appreciably in recent years; it is relying a
good deal on the recent divestment of four state-owned mills.
This performance has not generated the levels of growth which the government
was expecting from its move towards rapid deregulation of the economy.
Bankers have conservatively estimated GDP growth last year at less than 1
per cent.
Mr Davies supports this suggestion of stagnation with an - almost inevitable
 -analogy to cricket: 'I have not lost any wickets, but I have not scored
any runs.' He expects to score this year, but not much, and is forecasting
economic growth at between 2 and 3 per cent.
Jamaica's external trade balance is worsening. A 22.4 per cent rise in
imports resulted in the merchandise trade deficit widening to Dollars 830.3m
between January and October of last year. A year earlier the deficit was
Dollars 533.3m. Reduced earnings from bauxite and the government's decision
a year ago to reduce import duties on motor vehicles have contributed to
this. Figures for the 10 month period last year show imports of machinery
and transport equipment up 45.7 per cent to Dollars 433.3m.
Financing this deficit might prove too steep a task for tourism, income for
the expansion of financial services into foreign markets, and overseas
remittances. Money sent to relatives by the Jamaican diaspora - mainly in
London, Toronto, New York and Miami - makes an important contribution to the
ability of the island's people to survive these difficult times.
But while many admit that it is 'large' and 'important,' no one knows the
size of this part of the informal economy. (Mr Davies thinks it is second
only to tourism as a source of foreign currency.)
Mr Seaga contends that a better way of dealing with the trade imbalance is
to correctone flaw in the government's economic policy, 'The government is
failing not in the demand management policies, but in giving emphasis to the
demand side and ignoring the supply side,' he says. 'Exports have been at
the same level over the past four years, but imports have been growing.'
Amid repeated statements by the government about concerns over inflation and
currency depreciation, Mr P J Patterson, the prime minister, says the
administration intends to stay the course and will not alter economic
policy.
There are signs of some stability, claims Mr Jacques Bussieres, the governor
of the central bank. The exchange rate has moved only slightly since early
December, reducing inflationary pressure, with indications that the rate
could be below 15 per cent for the fiscal year which begins in April.
There is also some comfort within the government over aspects of the foreign
debt (higher per capita than many of the better known debtors in Latin
America). A series of reschedulings and bilateral and commercial debt, and a
regular respect for its obligations to its creditors, has seen the debt
stock fall from Dollars 4.1bn in 1980 to Dollars 3.6bn last year. The price
of Jamaica's debt on the international market has moved from an average of
36 cents in 1987 to 82 cents last year. Net international reserves at the
end of last year stood at Dollars 12.5m, an improvement of Dollars 98.1m on
a year earlier.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Survey of Jamaica (1): Island in transition - Jamaica still
beset by old problems as it works towards a modern economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The ideological turmoil that marked Jamaican politics until the early 1980s
has gone.
Now the country's two political parties fight over the philosophical middle
ground. Both support deregulation and liberalisation of the economy. The
moves to lower tariffs and end import restrictions are now uncontroversial.
In other ways, however, the country's problems remain disturbingly familiar.
The economy last year grew at about 1 per cent, barely keeping pace with the
population. High inflation has gnawed away at living standards and increased
already large disparities between rich and poor.
The government of Mr Percival Patterson, the new leader of the People's
National Party, forcefully renewed its in a general election last March. One
of his government's priorities is, he says, reducing inflation.
'Inflation is the critical issue,' says Mr Omar Davies, the new finance
minister, adding that inflation - 30 per cent in 1993, 77 per cent in 1992 -
should drop to about 1 per cent a month in a few months.
However, the economic and social costs of achieving this will be high. The
interest rates in place since the battle against inflation resumed in the
middle of last year are having reverberations round the economy, creating
stresses for companies and dampening investment.
'It's very difficult to borrow money at 65-70 per cent, invest it and make a
return at the end of the day. And if you have spare cash, it makes most
sense to put it on deposit and get over 50 per cent,' says Mr Charles Ross,
executive director of the Private Sector Organisation of Jamaica. It has
further contributed to weakness in manufacturing. The only area of growth in
the manufacturing sector has been that of garment assembly, where finished
garments are re-exported to the US under special duty free arrangements.
This, combined with a weak market for one of the mainstays of the Jamaican
economy, bauxite and alumina, has led to a dramatic increase in the trade
deficit - it exceeded Dollars 1bn last year, Mr Davies says.
What is, on the face of it, a serious issue for the economy has been offset
to some extent by buoyancy in tourism, now the single biggest contributor to
foreign exchange earnings. Remittances by Jamaicans abroad are also
significant. More Jamaicans live outside the island - particularly in the US
 -than the 2.5m who reside there. They contribute an estimated Dollars 250m
to Dollars 400m annually to foreign exchange earnings, and help to alleviate
the poverty suffered at home.
These remittances are part of a large informal economy about which the
government knows little and controls less. Unfortunately this includes the
thriving business in illegal narcotics.
Once an important source of marijuana for the US market, Jamaica is now an
big transhipment point for cocaine traffic to the US. This involvement with
drugs has eroded traditional family and social ties, particularly in urban
Kingston, and has provided one of the few routes out of the ghetto for poor
children in the capital, where unemployment can reach 75 per cent.
It has contributed to a disturbing rise in violent crime. The ability or
willingness of politicians to tackle this issue has been called into
question by the links between political parties and criminal gang leaders,
particularly in the capital.
This impression was reinforced by the appearance of the leader of the
opposition Jamaica Labour Party, Mr Edward Seaga, at the funeral of one such
gang leader, Mr Jim Brown, in 1992. Mr Patterson has been applauded for his
decision to bring in a respected outsider to clean up a police force which
has lost most of its credibility in the public eye. But it is still
necessary for political representatives of certain constituencies in
Kingston to reach an accommodation with gang-leaders.
If this has contributed to a distrust of the political system, there has
also been dissatisfaction with the results. This has been accepted by
politicians who have sought to tackle some of the perceived problems through
the first important revision of the 1962 constitution. This, it is
envisaged, would lay down a charter of rights, alter the make-up and
selection of the senate, and replace Queen Elizabeth II as head of state
with an executive president with limited powers.
Attempts are also being made to address the issue of electoral reform. The
aim is to give the voting system more credibility and to try to eliminate
the violence still associated with Jamaican elections; to stop double
voting; and to clean up the voting lists. However, that process has been
held up by disputes between the two parties about how to handle the issue.
The outcome of these political reforms may be to constrain somewhat the
virtually untrammelled power of the prime minister in the political system.
But it is unlikely to do much, at least in the short-term, to alter the
country's two-party system.
The differences between the two parties are now more a matter of style and
implementation. 'One would have to accept that no longer do the ideological
polarities between the two parties exist,' says Mr Patterson. His party,
with its roots in populist socialism, still maintains, he says, more of a
focus than the opposition on the social consequences of its policies.
For his part, Mr Seaga - whose party has shifted its ideology significantly
less than the ruling PNP - accuses Mr Patterson of 'leading from behind'. He
adds: 'The same policies can be executed properly or poorly.'
He makes no apology for his own authoritarian image, saying the country
needs strong leadership that is lacking at the moment. Having slapped down a
revolt in his party, Mr Seaga looks set to contest the next general election
 -which can take place as late as March 1997 but will probably be called a
year or so earlier - as leader of the Labour Party. Before then, the
government will need to have reduced inflation and restarted growth.
Despite the economy's problems, Mr Ross says the economy is quite well
poised. 'It's clear that barring a big collapse of the bauxite business or
of the tourism industry, the economy is much closer to self-sufficiency than
it has been in any time in the last 20 years.' The government may also
benefit from a likely recovery in the aluminium market and the continued
buoyancy of the US economy, on which Jamaica heavily depends.
The term 'Jamerica' has been coined to reflect heavy dependency on the US
economy. These close links face a challenge from the North American Free
Trade Agreement (Nafta) between the US, Canada and Mexico. Mr Peter King,
ambassador at large on trade matters and chairman of the Textiles and
Apparels Institute, says that Nafta means Mexico will gain a competitive
advantage over other countries in the region, including Jamaica. 'It doesn't
mean that people are closing plants here to move to Mexico, but levels of
investment expansion planned for the Caribbean have slowed,' he says.
He believes the current US concessions to the Caribbean under the Caribbean
Basin Initiative cannot always be taken for granted, and that Jamaica should
first press for parity with Nafta and then accession to the treaty. 'My own
view is that without parity to this free trade agreement, we would be
marginalised. We are not a Switzerland that can sit in the middle of
Europe.'
The question is whether Jamaica goes it alone or attempts to join Nafta as
part of Caricom (Caribbean Community and Common Market). Caricom currently
appears divided on the issue, with some countries concerned that the
concessions under the Lome agreements with the European Union will be
threatened by Nafta. Mr King says: 'If we can't do it with Caricom, we
should go on our own.'

FT  28 FEB 94 / Survey of Jamaica (2): Interest rates hit 50 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government says tackling inflation is its main priority.
If some Jamaicans are sceptical, it is because the government failed to stay
the course back in 1991-92. Then, with an eye apparently on the election
last March, it relaxed monetary and fiscal policy and attempted to peg the
exchange rate to the dollar.
The inflation battle resumed in earnest in the middle of last year, although
a subsequent slide in the value of the Jamaican dollar gave inflation
another boost. The main weapon has been a tight monetary policy which has
pushed interest rates to more than 50 per cent.
The prime minister has promised to balance this stringency with a more
restrictive fiscal policy. Mr Davies says fiscal policy is already tight -
but 'I want to be able to do better with the fiscal surplus.' Among other
things, he says he will try to improve the government's ability to monitor
government departments' spending.
According to Mr Patterson, the prime minister, one consequence of this will
be a clamp-down on rises in public sector pay following big increases last
year. 'In the last fiscal year, substantial increases were paid to the
public sector partly because of the need to reduce disparities with the
private sector. There is simply no way in which we can afford these levels
of pay rises in 1994-95,' he says.
There will also be a continuation of the government's privatisation
programme. After the sale of four sugar mills last year, the government is
also aiming to privatise the national airline, Air Jamaica, the Jamaican
state electricity company, the oil refinery and the railway, and to pass
some functions of the water authority to the private sector.
Yet some critics of the government reckon its deeds are less impressive than
its rhetoric. 'The general thrust, if you go by what the government says,
has been quite good. Things have worked out differently in practice,' says
Mr Charles Ross, executive director of the Private Sector Organisation of
Jamaica.
He believes fiscal policy is still not strong enough. Publicly-owned
companies, he says, are still on too slack a leash, able to reschedule debts
unilaterally, for example, and to borrow to pay wages.
Moreover, Mr Ross says that if the government's net repayment of debt is
factored into the calculation, it is in fact running a deficit, rather than
a surplus, which may be as high as 5-6 per cent of GDP. The finance minister
counters by saying that Jamaica follows international conventions in
ignoring debt amortisation in its calculations.
Moreover, tax receipts tend to be too heavily concentrated in the fourth
quarter of the fiscal year - the first quarter of the calendar year. This
means that the deficit intra-year, financed by the Jamaican central bank and
thereby fuelling excess demand, can be extremely high.
Employment by the public sector has been reduced by some 20 per cent in the
last few years. In the view of some, too much of this has been achieved by
shaving the workforce in each department instead of making a fundamental
spending reassessment.
A further constraint in reducing public spending has been the high
proportion of the government budget - more than 40 per cent - swallowed up
by servicing internal and external debt.
Jamaica has benefited from debt forgiveness from foreign government
creditors. However, it wants the concessional terms extended to the poorest
countries by the Paris Club of creditor governments to be widened to include
it.
Although its requests have so far been unsuccessful, the perception of
Jamaica's creditworthiness in international financial markets has improved
as prices for the government's debt in the secondary market have risen
significantly - helped not only by the generally rising market in the debt
of most Latin American and Caribbean countries, but also by the clearing of
arrears on trade payments that existed in the late 1980s.

FRANKFURT
The Bundesbank is unlikely to add to last week's uncertainty by opting for a
variable rate at Wednesday's repo operation, says NatWest Securities. With
the IG Metall ballot in Lower Saxony likely to show strong support for a
strike, the bond market is likely to be most reassured by a fixed rate repo
10 - 20 basis points below the current 6 per cent. This would be enough to
show that European rates are still free to move downwards, but not so much
as to arouse fears that the Bundesbank, whose council meets on Thursday, is
losing its grip.
AMSTERDAM
The results season gets under way in earnest this week. Polygram reports
today with UBS expecting a 20.3 per cent increase in net profits on 10.5 per
cent higher sales. Bols Wessanen is forecast to report a 5 per cent rise in
net profits on Wednesday and Philips is seen posting a Fl 805m net profit on
Thursday, after 1992's Fl 900m loss.
ZURICH
Credit Suisse and Swiss Volksbank present full-year consolidated results
together for the first time on Friday. The figures will represent about 70
per cent of the total CS Holding result.
PARIS
Chargeurs, the textile and communications group, which has undergone a major
restructuring during the last year, is expected to post a net loss of FFr200
on Thursday, down from a profit of FFr366m in 1992.
MILAN
The privatisation of Banca Commerciale Italiana begins today and is
scheduled to conclude on Friday. The offer could, however, close early if,
as was the case in the recent IMI sell-off, it is heavily oversubscribed.
TOKYO
Domestic investors will continue to take a cautious stance as companies take
profits on their investment portfolios before the March-end book-closing.
Although some economists expect tomorrow's tankan, the Bank of Japan's
quarterly report on business sentiment, to indicate a bottoming out of the
economy, domestic institutions, unlike overseas investors, are unlikely to
accumulate positions ahead of the fiscal year-end.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Equity Markets: Shares still attuned to bond trends - New
York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Equity investors are entering a potential minefield this week, with a batch
of signals on inflation laid out before them and fears over the direction of
monetary policy running rampant.
'We're not going to have a lot of fun,' says Mr Alfred Goldman, technical
analyst at AG Edwards &amp; Sons, a St Louis securities house. 'We just had the
first truly nasty week of a correction. The market is going to lose sleep
over the weekend thinking about it, and the bears will be licking out their
chops on Monday morning.'
As last week's action demonstrated, shares are still closely attuned to bond
market trends. The results were not pretty. The Treasury market went into a
mid-week tail-spin, haunted by real and imagined signs that the Federal
Reserve was poised for a second strike on interest rates, three weeks after
the first.
Shares followed bonds down, ignoring the completion of a fourth-quarter
reporting season that brought news of a 60 per cent gain in corporate
earnings and solid evidence of continued growth in the current three-month
period.
By the week's end, the Dow Jones Industrial Average showed a 47-point net
decline to 3,838.78, including Thursday's 51-point rout, triggered by the
collapse of Bell Atlantic's proposed merger with Tele-Communications Inc.
Mr Goldman believes the market will suffer more losses this week, no matter
how the bond market performs. 'In a correction, bad news is bad, and good
news is bad, too,' he says.
Mr Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments in New
York, agrees that Wall Street will probably have to navigate some choppy
activity over the next five days. But he sees shares continuing to 'feed
off' the bond market and links a further slide in prices this week to
developments there.
'Investors are spooked by high interest rates,' he says, adding that the
anxiety is likely to abate in the next few weeks. Reassurance will depend on
more data suggesting the economy is no danger of overheating, beginning with
Tuesday's purchasing managers' index, a good leading indicator of the
economy's pace.
The week will culminate with Friday's report on the February employment
trends. Analysts are looking for an increase of 150,000 in payrolls last
month. If their estimates prove accurate, Mr Cardillo believes shares could
return to stability, although February's cold weather may provide an excuse
to explain away a favourable reading.
If the forecast proves to have been timid, however, a big sell-off is
possible.
On a bright note, bargain hunters are expected to give a lift to
telecommunications and cable stocks, which were battered last week when Bell
Atlantic's announcement raised an unexpected detour in the development of
the 'information superhighway'. The sector's rebound was already evident on
Friday, when the technology-rich Nasdaq composite index clearly outperformed
the large-cap indices.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Equity Markets: Big sell-off in gilts casts a shadow -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND

<TEXT>
The equity market was certainly taught a sharp lesson on Thursday; the only
question left open was just what was the lesson and who was doing the
teaching. The gilt-edged market, falling heavily in the European-wide
sell-off which reflected US worries over the next move by the Federal
Reserve, was clearly behind the 2.2 per cent drop in London share prices.
Yet many equity strategists flatly rejected fears that interest rates were
about to rise in Europe.
'Central banks, and that includes the Bank of England, are not about to
abort the economic recovery by pushing rates higher,' summed up the views of
a number of London-based trading houses. Salomon International hastened to
assure clients that much the same argument applied to the Federal Reserve,
which it believes is also more concerned to foster recovery in the US than
to curb it.
London's largest institutional broker was urging investors to buy the London
stock market on Thursday, even as the Footsie Index was plunging. And retail
business in equities on Thursday, worth Pounds 1.7bn, was by no means at
panic levels.
Britain's largest institutional broking house was urging clients to buy UK
equities, on the simple premise that they were a lot cheaper than on the day
before.
The lesson was that, since Christmas, equities have been focusing too
strongly on one factor - the chances of another base rate cut. And that
lesson was delivered from the derivatives market, which reinforced their
power by driving share prices mercilessly downwards for a change. In
contrast, with the relatively mild selling in equities, both stock index
futures and traded options saw heavy trading.
The London market is now almost 8 per cent off from the peak reached a few
weeks ago and the Footsie charts indicate an uncomfortable absence of
support levels. With the Federal Reserve still expected to tweak rates
higher again soon, stock markets have every reason to remain extremely
cautious.
One other point emerged last week. Optimists hoping that improving company
results will take over from interest rate hopes as the motor driving the
market may need to think again. The response to trading news from ICI,
National Westminster Bank and British Aerospace underlined that good profits
are not necessarily enough. The market reacted sharply when NatWest produced
profits at the lower end of expectations and ICI's unflattering remarks on
current trading outweighed other factors when its figures were announced.
This was a second reason for fearing the stock market was heading for a
fall, even before the US bond markets decided to take a hand. The banking
and financial sectors, which led the charge both before and after Christmas,
are paying dearly.
Friday's rally in share prices owed much to traditional end of account
influences, with the falls of the previous day discouraging investors from
rolling positions over to the new trading period.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Equity Markets: Fund managers see future in OTC derivatives
 -Risk and Reward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Derivatives fund management is crossing a new frontier with the advent of
funds investing in over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives.
Kleinwort Benson launched an open-end Derivative Products Fund in January
which specialises in OTC derivatives on global interest rates and is
incorporated in Ireland.
In April 1993, the fund management arm of Gottex, the Swiss swaps brokers,
launched its offshore Global Swap Fund, based in Bermuda, which has some
Dollars 90m under management. For the period to December 31 1993, it posted
an annualised return of 39.4 per cent.
Both the funds invest primarily in derivative instruments traded on the
inter-bank markets. These include interest-rate swaps, forward rate
agreements, options, swaptions and complex derivatives structures.
'These instruments allow for the construction of tailor-made payment, risk
and arbitrage profiles which cannot be replicated through other
instruments,' says Mr Konstantin von Schweinitz, who heads Kleinwort
Benson's derivative products group.
By contrast, 'cash instruments restrict dealing to available bonds and
provide little opportunity to establish forward positions, while dealing in
futures is limited to standardised contracts and delivery dates,' he says.
Both funds are targeted at professional investors: investment institutions
looking to diversify, financial institutions with limited access to OTC
markets, private investors, and professional money managers looking for
alternatives to managed futures funds.
'The swap market has been booming since 1980 and banks made very good,
consistent returns in it,' says Mr John Haam, who manages the G-Swap fund.
'But banks and large corporations are the only institutions who can trade in
the inter-bank market, and we wanted to offer these instruments to investors
who can't directly access this market.'
'The OTC market is much more flexible than exchange-traded markets - it
allows you to do exactly what you want rather than roughly what you want,'
says Mr David Moore, director at Credit Lyonnais Rouse.
One concern lies in understanding the risks these new types of funds may
represent.
'Investors will find it very difficult to assess the risks,' says David
Anderson, chairman of Allingham, Anderson, Roll &amp; Ross, which uses advanced
mathematical techniques for investment management.
'Do they have any audited, authorised past performance records? And how can
investors assess the counterparty risks involved?' he asks.
'One of the key reasons there are so few OTC funds is the problem of credit
risk,' concedes KB's Mr von Schweinitz.
'The OTC market has grown up on an unsecured basis and the creditworthiness
of its participants is a critical component.'
However, he says that KB 'deals with credit risk through securitising
individual transactions.'
All transactions are entered into on a two-way margin basis with
professional counterparties, limiting the counterparty risk of the fund to
the initial margin, he explains.
After the huge losses recently incurred by highly leveraged funds in
tumultuous bond and currency markets, some warn of the risks of investing in
complex derivatives traded in an unregulated market.
But according to Gottex's Mr Haam: 'It all depends on how you manage it  -
this sort of fund can be anything to anybody. You can run it like a bond
fund, a futures fund or a spread-arbitrage fund.'

It was a lugubrious week for German government securities and the mood of
the market is unlikely to improve in the days ahead.
The steep rise in yields was driven by knock-on effects of the US Federal
Reserve's small rate increase in early February. It has helped foreign
investors, massive buyers of bunds last year, to revise their view of the
attractions of the German market.
Even if the trend of German interest rates is down, in contrast to the
probability of steadily rising rates in the US, the prospect of further
Bundesbank rate cuts is not enough to inspire foreign investors to buy
heavily into the bund market, says Klaus Holschuh, head of fixed income
research at Commerzbank.
On the contrary, foreign investors will be looking to seize on any data they
can interpret as an excuse to sell. The Bundesbank will duly oblige by
publishing the January M3 supply figure today or tomorrow. Following on from
the distorted December figure - the annualised, seasonally adjusted growth
in M3 was 8.1 for that month - further distortions are likely to take the
January growth figure to 10 per cent or more.
No matter that the figure is genuinely distorted, and that underlying
inflation is well on the way down, the data is likely to be seen as a good
reason for selling bunds.

FT  28 FEB 94 / World Bond Markets: Hedge funds wield their clout - Capital
&amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few dealers and investors can have been left in any doubt about the enormous
muscle-power of the hedge funds as they stampeded through the European
government bond markets last week.
Heavy selling of government bond futures - and to a lesser extent of the
cash bonds - by hedge funds led to sharp falls in the markets and left
traditional pension and insurance fund managers standing on the sidelines
wondering when the bloodbath was going to finish.
'It was like a juggernaut - you just wanted to get out of the way to avoid
being crushed,' said one fund manager.
Hedge funds are private investment pools which borrow large sums of money to
trade securities and currencies in the financial markets.
They are often managed very aggressively and can be highly geared. While the
amount of money they manage is not known, the clout they exert in the
financial markets is enormous. In the futures markets, trading volumes
soared last week as the hedge and futures funds dominated activity.
On the Paris-based Matif exchange, the Notional Bond futures contract - the
most heavily traded futures contract in Europe - jumped to a daily volume of
404,422 lots last Thursday. The average daily volume for the contract in
1993 was 164,633 lots.
The London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, reported
record volumes last Thursday, with 1.38m futures and options contracts
traded, representing a nominal value of Pounds 270bn.
Liffe's bund futures contract topped the 300,000 level to reach a record
317,595 contracts, while the long gilt futures contract hit a record 235,759
contracts.
Not only was the volume staggering - dealers were reporting very large
individual transactions, for example of 30,000 contracts in the bund futures
market, corresponding to a nominal value of DM7.5bn.
'These are enormous positions: if you sell that kind of amount you are bound
to move the market,' said one fund manager.
Hedge funds vary considerably in size. The big players are those like George
Soros's Quantum Fund, which took a hit on the unexpected rise of the yen
against the dollar in the middle of February.
Others are much smaller operations: 'Sometimes they just consist of a couple
of guys trading out of their spare bedroom someplace in Bermuda or
California - they get up in the middle of the night to catch the European
bond markets,' says one dealer.
So why have they been selling so heavily?
Some made heavy losses on the yen/dollar exchange rate move and have had to
cover them by liquidating other positions, for example in European
government bonds.
As these markets fell, some hedge funds were forced to close their positions
in order to limit the size of their losses.
In other cases, they had to put up more money to meet margin calls as the
futures markets moved against them - and in order to meet these margin calls
they may have had to liquidate other positions.
While some market participants appear dazed by the whole tumultuous
experience, others have been shaken into examining their relationships with
the hedge funds rather more carefully.
Preliminary figures suggest that hedge and futures funds made losses of up
to 25 per cent in February, but lurking in the back of many people's minds
is the fear of what would happen if a few of the hedge funds were to be
wiped out completely - even though in many cases, the funds have a maximum
draw-down in order to prevent losses beyond a certain cut-off point.
'The big funds are well-controlled and even though some of them have taken
big hits, these probably are not life-threatening: if you have a fund with
Dollars 40bn under management, it will be pursuing a variety of trading
strategies.
'It might take a hit on three of them, but 10 of them are probably doing
OK,' says one risk analyst.
More worrying, however, is the position with smaller hedge funds: these
might have a net asset value of between Dollars 10m and Dollars 50m and
could be very highly geared: they are less likely to have widely diversified
trading strategies so could be more vulnerable.
The other area of concern regards the way in which positions are financed.
The fund may borrow money from an investment bank using the fund's bond
portfolio as collateral. As one investment bank put it: 'Say they give us
bonds worth Dollars 100, we lend them Dollars 95 against the collateral, and
that difference is to cover us in case the bond price goes down.
'But because there has been such a big push to do business with the hedge
funds, the margins have gone down to zero.'
This means that if the hedge fund went bust, the investment bank would be
left holding the bonds, but it could find that after such a sharp market
fall the bonds are worth much less than the money originally lent.

Concern about oversupply, the recent declines in global bond markets and
fiscal year-end inactivity are likely to weigh on the Japanese government
bond market.
The government is expected to auction long-term bonds this week while
domestic corporate bond issues are likely to add to worries over supply.
But activity is expected to remain low ahead of the March book-closing since
most investors have locked in profits and few are willing to take new
positions.
The Bank of Japan, concerned at the overall rise in interest rates, is
likely to maintain an easy stance in its money market operations.
Demand from banks ahead of the year-end has pushed up three-month
certificate of deposit rates. In addition, the long-term credit banks are
poised to raise their prime lending rates - rates on loans to first tier
customers.
The central bank is worried over the effects of higher interest rates on a
still sluggish economy, which will be highlighted in the Tankan, the BoJ's
quarterly survey on business sentiment, to be announced on Tuesday.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd expects the Tankan to show a further deterioration in
confidence but this should be limited because the survey was taken before
the breakdown of US-Japan trade talks and the rise in the yen.

If there was any doubt left in anyone's mind, last week confirmed that the
long bull run in bonds had reached a turning point. Mr Alan Greenspan,
chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, may have talked tough on inflation in
his testimony to Congress on Tuesday, but bond prices kept sinking. The
yield on 30-year Treasury bonds has risen nearly half a point since the Fed
raised short-term rates on February 4.
This week, a mass of economic data will provide the market with the
opportunity to feed on its own fears. Revised figures for gross domestic
product in last year's fourth quarter are due today, with some economists
predicting that the earlier estimate of 5.9 per cent could translate into an
actual 7 per cent. The purchasing managers' index of buying intentions is on
Tuesday, followed by personal income and home sales figures on Wednesday,
factory stocks on Thursday, then employment indicators on Friday.
In one sense, it hardly matters what the numbers say. If the figures point
to rapid economic growth, bond prices will fall. If the numbers are weak,
people will say it was a weather-related aberration, and prices will still
fall. That is the sort of mood the market is in. It is convinced the last
interest rate rise was only the first of many - and that the next is not far
away.

FT  28 FEB 94 / World Bond Markets: ECP sector gaining in popularity -
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although it has been overshadowed by the bigger and more glamorous Eurobond
market over the past few years, the European commercial paper (ECP) market
has been enjoying a quiet but steady rise in its popularity.
Renewed confidence in the market's ability to provide quick access to
short-term liquidity at competitive rates is seen as the main factor helping
to attract a growing number of issuers and investors.
BZW said in a recent review that question marks over the liquidity and
efficiency of the ECP market were finally eliminated last June when the
Kingdom of Denmark raised as much as Dollars 1.5bn in a matter of days to
support the Danish krone when it came under attack from foreign exchange
speculators.
Confidence in the market's depth was given a further boost by the launch of
large ECP programmes by Ford Credit Europe, Hanson and Guinness which
allowed them to quickly raise funds of more than Dollars 1bn, amounts which
have previously been the sole domain of sovereign borrowers.
Mr David Knight, managing director of CP operations at BZW, says the
progressive convergence of rates between the domestic CP market in the US,
where outstandings are estimated at Dollars 500bn, and the ECP market has
meant that at times, rates in the ECP market are lower than in the US.
'This has resulted in cheaper cost of funding for US companies,' he says,
adding that the ECP market also provides them with a tax-efficient way of
funding their European operations.
Mr Chris van Niekerk, director of money-market business at Swiss Bank Corp
in London, also attributes the rise in ECP volume to the inroads which the
ECP market has made into the German and Swiss domestic markets as a result
of deregulation in the two countries. Issuers can now issue in D-Marks and
Swiss francs directly under their ECP programmes. 'Calling it a Euro-CP
market is a bit of a misnomer because it is becoming a global CP market
outside the US domestic market,' he says.
The short maturities available in the ECP market, from one day to 364 days,
make ECP highly suitable as an underlying asset for investors wishing to
swap into other currencies which have greater yields. Mr van Niekerk
estimates that 35 per cent of the ECP volume issued by borrowers in dollars
is swapped into other currencies by investors. 'Due to the volatility in the
currency market this has been a fruitful activity for investors,' he says.
The revival in the market's fortunes has been reflected in an increase in
dollar-denominated ECP issuance, which accounts for around 80 per cent of
the whole ECP market. Having dropped as low as Dollars 75.1bn last March,
dollar-denominated ECP outstandings rose as high as Dollars 85.1bn in
November. They are currently estimated to be about Dollars 81.5bn.
Ms Julie Joe, CP product manager at Lehman Brothers, is optimistic on
prospects for 1994 and believes ECP market volume could increase by 10-15
per cent this year. 'The bearish interest-rate environment favours issuance
in the short-term market,' she says.
In recent years, the downward spiral in interest rates has prompted issuers
to lock in historically low rates with long-dated bond issues. However, this
type of financing has become more difficult since the start of this year as
the fear of higher interest rates has prompted investors to focus on the
short end of the yield curve.
Lesser dependence on time deposits by clearing banks has also encouraged
investors to park liquid assets in the ECP market, where rates are often
more favourable. At the same time, the short-term nature of the ECP market
meets the investment criteria of Far Eastern investors who are increasingly
flush with cash.
ECP experts believe that as a greater fluidity develops between the ECP
market and US CP market, investors who buy ECP will become more flexible
regarding the credit ratings of issuers.
At present, investors in ECP tend to be rather conservative and restrict
themselves to paper issued by top-rated borrowers. However, as in other
fixed-income and equity markets, there has been growing investor demand for
unrated ECP issued by emerging market borrowers, notably from Mexico.
As a result of this 'black-and-white' attitude to credit ratings, many
issuers with mediocre ratings have difficulty in raising significant sums in
the ECP market. By contrast, they have relatively good access to the US
domestic market.
Mr Knight believes that the improving economic climate in the US and the UK
(these two geographic regions account for 33 per cent of all ECP issues)
should see an improvement in the fortunes of borrowers which have been
downgraded over the past few years. 'The upgrading to the critical A1/P1
level will allow heavy issuers to resume issuance,' he says.
In addition to the ECP market accepting a wider range of credits, Ms Joe
highlights the asset-backed sector as a potential area for growth. This kind
of issuance is already well-developed in the US.

Traders will be hoping that the gilts market can enjoy a respite this week
after the battering it has taken since the start of the year. The benchmark
9 per cent 2008 issue has fallen by around nine points since January 1,
while the yield has risen from 6.38 to 7.23 per cent.
Many feel the falls in prices have ignored the promising economic outlook.
'Nothing has changed in the past few weeks to justify a change in the
fundamental view of inflation in the UK,' say Mr Julian Wiseman and Mr David
Mackie of J P Morgan.
There are few economic statistics due this week which could change the mood
of the UK market. The main event will be Wednesday's monthly monetary
meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Eddie
George, governor of the Bank of England.
After the poor reaction to last month's rate cut, the duo could be forgiven
for being cautious about further cuts; on the other hand, the April tax
increases have yet to hit consumers' pockets.
Any decision to cut rates would not be acted upon immediately, giving the
market plenty of scope for speculation, but it is hard to resist the
conclusion that it will be the mood of international bond markets, and
particularly US Treasuries, that will determine the short-term fate of
gilts.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Emerging Markets: Hungary frees bond market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hungary is preparing the first domestic bond issue open to foreign investors
to buy and trade freely, writes Nicholas Denton in Budapest.
The Budapest finance ministry has mandated GiroCredit, the Austrian bank, to
manage the transaction, likely to be worth Ft15bn (Dollars 144m), and a date
of March 28 has been pencilled in.
Twin budget and current account deficits underly the decision to open the
government bond market.
The government has relied on selling Forint bonds to domestic investors and
hard-currency bonds on international capital markets.
Last year the National Bank of Hungary sold Dollars 4.5bn worth of bonds in
dollars, D-Marks, Yen and other denominations.
Now the government hopes to tap new sources of finance by allowing foreign
funds to make a direct bet on Forint exchange and interest rates.
But the finance ministry has had to overcome the NBH's aversion to an influx
of foreign 'hot money' into government paper. The central bank fears
movements in and out of the national currency would expose the Forint to
exchange-rate speculation.
East-central Europe has been flavour of the month among emerging markets
funds. But the attractiveness of the forthcoming issue will depend on the
Hungarian government's willingness to set a coupon sufficient to offset
expectations that the Forint will depreciate by about 15 per cent this year.
Several brokers who bid for the bond mandate said that the government was
pricing too keenly for the foreign market.
The impending issue is not the very first 'paprika bond.' One was offered in
1992 but it was divided into domestic and foreign tranches. Foreign
investors, forbidden to trade with local holders and fearful of illiquidity,
steered clear of the paper.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Emerging Markets: Slaski fracas fails to dent Polish
enthusiasm - The Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Demand for shares in Bank Slaski remains strong as the Warsaw stock exchange
continues to rise despite the running political row over the bank's
controversial privatisation.
Politicians, roused by a 13.5 times increase on Slaski's public offer price
of 500,000 zlotys when first listed last month, have attacked the pricing of
the offer, forcing Mr Marek Borowski, the finance minister, to resign. He
has yet to be replaced.
However, strong demand for the shares has also far outrun the technical
possibilities of the country's 40 or so broking houses who have already
opened about 400,000 accounts for individual investors and lack the capacity
to open many more. This means that many of the 800,000 people who have each
bought the 3 shares allocated in the offer are still impatiently waiting to
open accounts through which they will be able to sell their stock and take a
profit.
The Securities Commission, headed by the unbending Mr Leslaw Paga, has
meanwhile taken away Slaski's broking licence, accusing the the bank of
mismanaging its own privatisation. At the same time the state prosecutor is
investigating the possibility that the bank delayed confirming share
ownership by outside investors. This favoured its own employees who were in
a position to sell their shares on the first days of trading when the price,
because of low supply, was so high.
Late last week, in a bid to deflect criticism, the Slaski supervisory board
replaced the officials responsible for the broking operation. The bank, 26
per cent of whose equity was bought in the privatisation by the Dutch ING
group, is also appealing against the decision to take away its licence which
means that some 65,000 investors will have to go to other, already
overworked, houses.
This has not dampened investor enthusiasm for the exchange whose WIG
indicator, which reflects the capitalisation of the 23 stocks quoted three
time a week on the floor, looks set next week to break through the 20,000
mark compared to only 1040.7 a year ago.
The fracas, however, has not affected prospects for rights and new share
issues now coming to the market. The Export Development Bank, which has now
closed its 500bn zlotys rights issue, saw potential demand strong enough to
have raised twice that amount. Similarly, analysts expect the Exbud
construction company, despite disappointing 1993 results, to reach its 3m
new shares target - raising some 480bn zlotys in an offer underwritten by
three banks, including Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
The Swarzedz furniture factory is seeking to place 1m shares priced at
280,000 zlotys. The offer is at the head of a queue of companies due to come
to the market over the next six months either as a private flotation or a
disposal by the state. For example, Sankt Annae Bank, a Danish investment
bank, is preparing six companies for a listing and the Securities Commission
is presently examining a score of prospectuses.
The attitude of foreign investors, who are said to account for a tenth of
daily turnover and 25 per cent of capitalisation, is mixed. According to one
custodian bank, foreigners mostly took profits in February.
Mr John Presland, of ING's Hanseatic Investment Services in Warsaw, agrees
up to a point: 'Everyone accepts that the stocks on the WSE with an average
p/e of 34 are overpriced and those who invested last year have been taking
profits', he says, 'but those investment funds which didn't do anything last
year have now noticed the market are now interested in coming in'.
This provides an opportunity for Bank Przemyslowo Handlowy, one of the
country's largest banks and the next state bank to be privatised. The
finance ministry had been hoping to sell the bank by June but the lack of a
new minister means that this could be delayed.
'Strategic decisions have to be taken by mid-March if the timetable is to be
kept to,' a senior finance official said.
Bank management, headed by Mr Janusz Quandt, is in favour of having several
leading investors controlling 25 per cent of the bank's equity, with 30 per
cent staying in state hands and the remainder being offered to employees and
the general public.
The finance ministry, which had under previous regimes favoured asking
foreign banks to take a strategic stake in each of the banks privatised,
could now be forced to change its mind after criticism that ING had paid too
little for its Slaski stake.
The vexed question of price also has to be decided - should it be fixed by
the ministry or an auction conducted through the stock exchange?
One thing is certain. Domestic investor interest in the BPH offer is still
high.
The government has until the summer at least to sell the bank before the
market begins to be weighed down by new offers coming to the market.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Latin America
Two names linked in financial markets with the Latin American debt crisis
are joining forces to invest in companies in the region.
Mr Nicholas Brady, the former US Treasury Secretary whose debt initiative
helped to ease the crisis, is to head the new Washington-based company,
Darby Overseas Investments. Mr Daniel Marx, a former debt negotiator for
Argentina and until recently undersecretary of finance in Buenos Aires, will
be managing director.
According to Mr Hollis McLoughlin, a former aide to Mr Brady at the Treasury
and a senior official at the new company, Darby hopes to avoid paying
sky-high prices for Latin investments by seeking to back companies before
they make it to the stock market.
The fund, expected to have up to Dollars 100m at its disposal, will be
private. Its investors include Mr Brady himself and Bechtel Enterprises, the
finance and development arm of the big engineering group. Bechtel is a
former shareholder of the Dillon Read investment bank, which Mr Brady headed
before going to the Treasury.
Dillon Read's current chairman, Mr John Birkelund, and Mr George Wiegers, a
former managing director, are also backing the fund.
China
The Shenzhen stock exchange is halting all new listings. The authorities
said they would be resumed 'according to the market situation'.
Beijing has given approval for a total of Yn5.5bn (Dollars 632m) worth of
new shares to be issued this year, slightly higher than last year.
However, there is still a backlog of issues from last year waiting to be
listed.
Bogota
Colombia has approved the sale of the government's majority stake in
Corpavi, the housing and savings corporation. A presidential statement noted
that about 42m shares will be sold at 789.37 pesos (96 cents) each.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Currency Markets: Focus on US labour market statistics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign exchange markets this week will watch closely the release on Friday
of February labour market data for an indicator of the likely course of US
monetary policy.
It was the tightening of policy earlier this month, after the release of the
January labour data, which threw international financial markets into
disarray, from which they have yet to emerge.
The Humphrey-Hawkins testimony last week of Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of
the US Fed, signally failed to quell market fears about resurgent US
inflation.
Friday's data will offer a concrete basis to either confirm or confound
market pessimism about US inflation prospects.
The logical beneficiary of fears about higher US interest rates should be
the dollar. Last week, though, the US currency was generally weaker as fears
of a stronger yen dragged it down against other currencies.
In Europe, attention will revert to Germany. Today the Bundesbank will
announce the terms of its weekly repo, while the policy-making council meets
on Thursday.
Commentators believe the US may well have used the weekend meeting of G7
finance ministers in Frankfurt to urge the case for lower German interest
rates.
Although the Bundesbank cut its discount rate by 50 basis points at the last
council meeting, it did not lower the repo rate - the main instrument for
influencing money market rates. There is speculation that the central bank
may this week announce a variable rate repo. This would indicate a
willingness to see lower rates.
These factors might be outweighed by the unresolved labour dispute in the
engineering industry, and rumours that the January M3 number could be as
high as 13 per cent. There are also indications that the Bundesbank is more
concerned with steadying market expectations than outright monetary easing.
Weakness last week in the bund market can only have encouraged further
caution.
In the UK attention will be focused on Wednesday's monthly monetary policy
meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George,
governor of the Bank of England. Their last meeting resulted in a
quarter-point cut in rates.
Subsequent economic data has left a definite impression that the UK economic
recovery is weaker than previously thought. Commentators also believe that
an easing of monetary policy is likely ahead of the fiscal tightening in
April when new tax increases come into effect.

FT  28 FEB 94 / The Markets: Of currencies and crashes - Global Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After the turbulence of the past 10 days, many City pundits have thrown in
the towel, declaring that bond and equity markets are now hostage to
irrational forces and beyond orthodox diagnosis.
Well, up to a point, Lord Copper, as the servile journalists used to say to
Evelyn Waugh's megalomanic newspaper proprietor. But there are ways of
rationalising recent events which can throw light on market movements in the
weeks ahead, even if predictions about the next few days are best left to
necromancers and Nick Knight, the volatile soothsayer from Japanese
securities giant Nomura.
The starting point is that careless political talk costs money, especially
over trade and currencies.
The proximate cause of the Crash of 1987 was the threat by the then US
Treasury Secretary, James Baker, to push down the dollar against the D-mark.
No surprise, then, that war whoops from the US Administration over trade
with Japan ten days ago started the latest outbreak of nervousness in the
markets. The fear that a further punitive appreciation of the yen against
the dollar might lead to another rise in US interest rates appeared to
strengthen the case of those who argued that the quarter point rise in US
interest rates earlier this month constituted a decisive turning point. Yet
a closer comparison between the macro-economic factors behind the 1987 Crash
and those behind today's jitters suggests a less gloomy prognosis.
Throughout 1987 politicians and fund managers were obsessed with trade
imbalances between the US, and Japan and Germany. As a result of official
intervention to stem the dollar's decline after the Louvre Accord there was
a build up of liquidity which rubbed off on global securities markets. The
heated debate over current account imbalances took place against a
background of rising inflationary pressure as economic recovery in the G7
countries moved closer to maturity.
This time, in contrast, only the US economy is growing strongly. Elsewhere,
inflation is scarcely a threat in the short and medium term. There is an
absence of ill-considered, large-scale currency intervention. While the
Japanese have shown understandable irritation at the American lurch into a
perverse form of bilateralism just as the Japanese economy teeters on the
brink of a serious deflation, officials have hinted at concessions. Except
in the very short term, an appreciating yen is unsustainable given the
weakness of Japanese domestic demand.
That does not sound like the right macro-economic formula for a global
crash; or at least not unless politicians and central bankers put a great
deal more work into it.
Leveraged myopia
The parallels with October 1987 are much closer on the purely financial
front, in the sense that leverage is multiplying the consequences of small
changes in interest rates to an extraordinary degree.
While commercial bank balance sheets are probably in better shape than at
any time since the 1940s and 1950s, when they were stuffed with government
paper issued to finance wartime deficits, the balance sheets of securities
intermediaries may be more questionable.
At the turn of this year many market makers, who had just been paid
exceptionally large bonuses, were far too sanguine about future bond prices.
Much market fall-out has come from the trimming of positions.
These movements were then exaggerated by derivatives trading and program
trading, after the Fed's interest rate decision. Derivatives can themselves
be highly leveraged. And the people who are using them extensively include
the hedge funds, whose own operations are often leveraged five or six times
over with debt.
It seems plausible that the degree of leverage in modern securities markets
is higher than at any time in living memory. Small wonder market adjustments
to changes in policy direction are so violent.
Compounding the problem is the fact that investment bankers' capital can
look small in relation to their short-term money market funding
requirements. They know that they are vulnerable to wholesale market runs
because they cannot fall back on a retail deposit base or a lender of last
resort.
Their trading relationships cut across a huge range of instruments,
currencies, markets and time zones. Within the trading day they are not
always able to calculate their exposure to other traders or to their
counterparties.
No wonder rumours abound about problems at some of the best-known investment
banks. An important message for central bankers and securities watchdogs is
that the location of risk in the financial system has shifted somewhat from
the commercial banking towards the securities fraternity.
That is the inevitable consequence of the growing role of securities markets
in financial intermediation, which has been indirectly encouraged by the
tougher BIS capital regime for banks and the sophistication in dealing
techniques that technology now permits.
The message for investors is that leverage may lead to over-reaction in the
markets. They also need to remember that sharp market movements usually turn
out to be the solution not the problem - in this case, to overheating in
capital markets, which had attracted disproportionate sums from the US
banking system while the Fed was trying to put the banks back on their feet.
The question, when the dust begins to settle, is whether the market
adjustment has provided a full and final solution.
Unhinged
The other question for investors is how to cope with a world in which
economies are manifestly uncoupled while securities markets are shackled
together.
The charts suggest that developed world short-term interest rates do not
follow the US to the letter, even if there is a tendency to follow with a
lag. The bond markets, on the other hand, do appear to move together except,
as James Capel points out, when there is an exceptionally powerful domestic
influence such as German unification.
Since the lifting of exchange controls some convergence in bond markets made
sense, as governments were competing for capital in the same marketplace and
international investors were wielding a new discipline over fiscal policy.
But with such obvious scope for further declines in short-term rates in
European bond markets, it is interesting that Capel finds a degree of
regularity in the movement of bond yields and purely domestic economic
turning points - pleasing for those who see further potential in European
bonds. And the firm finds little relationship between commodity prices and
bond yields.
That should give commodity enthusiasts among the hedge fund managers pause
for thought. So, too, should the analysis in Brian Reading's latest opus for
Lombard Street Research, which makes a bold stab at providing a rationale
for recent commodity price movements.
Reading points to the causal relationship between the collapse of the
Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate regime, the subsequent explosion in world
reserves and the 1970s commodity price explosion. Yet when world reserves
accelerated both in absolute terms and relative to industrial production
between 1986 and the early 1990s, commodity prices failed to take off. Nor
does the recent spurt make sense on the basis of G7 industrial production in
an unsynchronised economic cycle.
Part of the explanation for the increase in world reserves in the 1980s is
simply currency intervention to support the dollar - note the blip on the
chart before the 1987 Crash. To the extent that intervention was sterilised,
to avoid any impact on domestic monetary conditions, commodity prices were
unaffected. But the table also shows that non-oil developing countries
accounted for between half and two thirds of the increase in foreign
currency reserves since 1980.
On the basis of plausible assumptions about the developing economies' share
in world industrial production, Reading concludes that commodity prices are
seeing a cyclical recovery, reinforced by financial speculation, that has
come earlier than normal relative to OECD growth.
Yet he is no bull of commodities. Commodity price increases in the OECD, he
argues, will be insufficient to offset the downward pressure on inflation
from continuing large output gaps everywhere apart from the US. Better to be
unhedged after all.

FT  28 FEB 94 / The Markets: Economic corrections are no occasion for panic
 -Economic Eye
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most damaging legacy of Keynesian economics has been the over-simplistic
attitude to policy-making it engendered. The error - one that cannot be
ascribed to the master himself - was the popular presumption that it is
possible to steer economies, almost quarter-by-quarter, on a path of rapid
non-inflationary growth combined with low unemployment.
What makes the recessions that have afflicted the major industrial countries
in the 1990s significant is that they demonstrate that such management is
infeasible. Except in continental Europe, where German unification has been
so important, the element of external surprise of the oil-shocks of the
1970s has been lacking. The most important industrial countries - the US and
Japan, though also the UK - have suffered, instead, from a credit-driven
business cycle previously unknown since the 1920s. In these economies - as
also in Germany, if for different reasons - the recession has reflected a
correction of past excesses.
The US and UK went into recession, together, in the middle of 1990 (see
chart). That these countries went into recession first was hardly
surprising, since their debt-fuelled growth of the 1980s had been
considerably stronger than that of continental Europe. Meanwhile, the
economies of Japan, the fastest growing industrial country, Germany, France
and Italy continued to expand until early 1992, whereupon they entered
recession.
Having sunk into recession first, the US and UK economies are now
recovering, the main difference between the two having been the length of
their recessions and the strength of their recoveries. The US has
experienced the blip that Nigel Lawson, as chancellor of the exchequer,
promised for the UK. The short US recession was merely enough to put Mr
Clinton into power, so allowing the president to take undeserved credit for
the recovery.
By contrast with the US, UK gross domestic product is still below its
pre-recession peak. It is surprising therefore, that UK short term interest
rates are 2 percentage points higher than those of the US, especially when
recent inflation performance of the two countries has been similar. That the
majority of the chancellor's panel of economic forecasters advised caution
over interest rate cuts last week demonstrates how deeply the policy
establishment has been bitten by past failures over inflation.
Kenneth Clarke has even boasted that the UK is the fastest growing major
economy in Europe. So it should be, since by 1992 it had, unlike the US,
lost all the ground it had made on the other three between 1982 and 1990. As
for those others, the central part of their story has been the shock of
German unification.
This helped push the German economy into a period of exceptional growth that
was not shared by France or Italy. The Bundesbank policies aimed at slowing
German inflation then pushed the already sluggish French and Italian
economies into recession. But the recession in Germany has been more severe
than in the other two, partly because the level of German economic activity
had also been pushed well above its longer run trend.
This merely demonstrates that the German monetary correction, justified in
itself, was inappropriate for France and Italy, just as it had been for the
UK in the last months of its ERM membership. The question, increasingly, is
whether German monetary policy is even appropriate for Germany.
Last but not least, there is Japan, whose economy has been going sideways
since early-1992. But this followed a period of extraordinarily rapid
money-driven growth in the late-1980s, as was true, if more briefly, of
Germany. In Japan too, correction has been unavoidable.
The picture of these recessions is intriguing, but its significance can only
be assessed in a longer term context. Here the chart is illuminating. First,
everyone must wish they had the same problems as the Japanese. Second, over
the entire cycle, Japan and the US have remained well ahead of the four
Europeans, which have stayed close together. For the first time since the
1940s, the UK has kept up with its European peers. What a pity they were
also slowcoaches.
The third and most important point is how much GDP has risen over the last
cycle, notwithstanding the recession. Over these 12 years, Japanese GDP has
risen by 50 per cent, that of the US by almost 40 per cent, the UK's by 30
per cent, and even German, French and Italian GDP by about a quarter. To put
this in perspective, the absolute increase in US GDP since 1982 has been
larger than total US GDP in 1940. That absolute increase is also equal to
the increment between 1940 and 1964 or again between 1964 and 1982.
Similarly, UK GDP has increased by as much since 1982 as it had previously
done between 1964 and 1982. Such are the miracles of compound interest.
Given the levels of wealth already enjoyed by advanced industrial countries,
this is rather a remarkable performance. The worry must be far more over the
distribution of the gains from growth, along with high and rising
unemployment in Europe, than over the size of increases in GDP. There could
also be a worry if recovery were unlikely. But it is not. Massive structural
changes will, no doubt, be required in future, as in the past, but there is
no reason to doubt the ability of those countries that entered recession
late to follow the US and UK out of it. They are probably beginning to do
so.
True, it would help if German and Japanese policy-makers were more
effective. But there is no reason to panic even over their failures.
Economic corrections happen. The recession is no depression and is most
unlikely to become one. If this realisation is why the finance ministers and
central bank governors of the group of seven leading industrial countries
agreed to decide nothing in particular at their meeting in Germany this
weekend, they showed considerable common sense.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Mike Walsh, one of the most highly-regarded executives in the US, is to
step down as chief executive of the Tenneco conglomerate. He and his family
want to devote themselves full-time to the treatment of a tumour discovered
on his brain last year.
The move will come as a blow to Tenneco, owner of the troubled Case
agricultural machinery business, because Mr Walsh was in the middle of
restructuring the group.
Mr Walsh will be succeeded as chief executive by Mr Dana Mead, 58, the
group's president and chief operating officer.

FT  28 FEB 94 / International Company News: AGF warns of lower earnings
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Assurances Generales de France (AGF), one of the largest French insurance
groups, has warned that 1993 net profits were lower than in 1992 because of
the problems at some of its French and Spanish interests.
AGF, scheduled for sale as part of the Balladur government's privatisation
drive, was badly affected last year by the difficulties of Comptoir des
Entrepreneurs, the troubled French finance company, and La Union y El Fenix,
the loss-making Spanish insurer.
The group took a leading role in the rescue of Comptoir des Entrepreneurs
and last week said that after protracted negotiations with the Bank of Spain
it was taking majority control of El Fenix by buying a stake from Banesto,
the beleaguered Spanish bank.
The cost of the rescue operations hit AGF's performance last year. The
company, which had previously announced static net interim profits of
FFr1.41bn (Dollars 243m) for the first half of 1993, says profits for the
full year will be lower than in 1992, when it made net profits of FFr1.5bn
on consolidated sales of FFr59bn.
AGF, like other French insurers, has been hurt by the recession. However,
the company, which in 1992 secured an important foothold in the German
insurance market through a significant minority shareholding in the AMB
group, was until last year's difficulties regarded as one of the more
resilient members of the French insurance industry.

Seagram, the international drinks group, has lifted its interest in Time
Warner, the multi-media giant, to 13.1 per cent from 11.7 per cent.
The cost of buying another 5m Time Warner shares between February 4 and
February 25 was Dollars 192m. The average price ranged from Dollars 37.75 to
Dollars 39.37 per share.
Seagram last reported a Time Warner share acquisition on January 20, when 5m
shares were bought for Dollars 205m.
Seagram, which owns almost 25 per cent of Du Pont, the chemicals giant, now
holds 49.2m Time Warner shares, up from 44.2m on January 20.
Early last summer, Mr Edgar Bronfman Sr, the chairman, announced that
Seagram had begun buying Time Warner stock in the market and was aiming at a
15 per cent stake for a total investment of USDollars 2bn. Mr Bronfman
insisted that his intentions were friendly. The Bronfman families of New
York and Montreal hold controlling interests in Seagram.
In January Time Warner set up a 'poison pill' designed to frustrate any
take-over and make any hostile bid prohibitively expensive.

FT  28 FEB 94 / International Company News: BBV declares interest in gaining
control of Banesto
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya has become the third big Spanish bank to publicly
declare its interest in controlling Banesto, the ailing financial
institution.
Banesto is to be recapitalised by the domestic banking sector and then
auctioned, either to a single domestic bank or a pool of banks.
Mr Emilio Ybarra, BBV chairman, told shareholders at the weekend 'we could
go (to the auction) alone, in association with one or more financial
institutions or we could even not go at all if we do not believe the
conditions (of the auction) to be acceptable.'
Rival banks, Banco Santander and Argentaria, the partially privatised state
banking corporation, have hired SG Warburg, the UK merchant bank, and
Goldman Sachs of the US respectively, to help them prepare bids for Banesto.
Mr Ybarra said Merrill Lynch, the US investment bank, will advise BBV.
The winner of the auction will take over a large branch network, making it
the leader of the domestic banking sector and one of the major financial
institutions in Europe.
It will, however, be burdened by Banesto's mounting losses and by the badly
damaged quality of its assets.
The critical state of Banesto's balance sheet prompted the authorities to
dismiss the bank's directors at the end of last year and to put a caretaker
board in charge.
Mr Ybarra said he believed Banesto would post a 1993 net loss of more than
Pta50bn.
Before the auction, the domestic institutions and the Bank of Spain will
absorb bad debts valued at Pta285bn and inject Pta180bn of fresh capital in
the form of a share issue.
If the rescue plan is approved by Banesto shareholders at the annual meeting
on March 26, the Bank of Spain will seek to have bids delivered by April 12.

FT  28 FEB 94 / International Company News: Threat to America West rescue
plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Unsecured creditors of America West Airlines, the last big US carrier still
in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, are threatening to block a rescue plan
put forward by the company and support a rival plan rejected by the board.
America West last week agreed to a Dollars 220m bid by a consortium linked
with Continental Airlines to pave the way for its reorganisation, preferring
it to a rival offer from Mr Michael Steinhardt, a New York money manager.
The consortium, AmWest Partners, is led by Air Partners, the investment
group which brought Continental Airlines out of bankruptcy last year and
which owns 28 per cent of Continental.
One of Air Partners' principles is Mr David Bonderman, Continental's
non-executive chairman.
Other investors in AmWest Partners are Continental Airlines itself, with
Mesa Airlines, a New Mexico-based regional carrier, and Fidelity
Investments, an investment group that specialises in bankruptcy rescues.
Under America West's preferred plan, AmWest Partners would provide America
West with Dollars 100m of long-term unsecured debt and Dollars 120m of
equity in return for 37.5 per cent of the reorganised company. An unnamed
secured creditor would get 7.5 per cent, unsecured creditors would get 45
per cent, and the remaining 10 per cent would be divided among existing
shareholders, provided the unsecured creditors receive the full value of
their claims.
America West said it would retain its independence after the proposed
reorganisation, but the alliance with Continental would enable the two to
co-operate in a range of marketing and operational areas.
The unsecured creditors said they opposed the AmWest plan, claiming it
involved creating two classes of stock that would leave AmWest with 70 per
cent of the votes. It favours the proposal put forward by Steinhardt
Partners of New York because this would give unsecured creditors 51 per cent
of the equity.

FT  28 FEB 94 / International Company News: US oil and gas refiner forced to
cut output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Castle Energy Corporation, the US oil and gas refining company whose sole
customer is MG Corp, the US subsidiary of Germany's Metallgesellschaft, is
struggling to pay suppliers and has been forced to reduce output as MG
tightens its credit arrangements with the company.
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Castle said: 'The
uncertainties resulting from MG's and its affiliates' possible inability to
continue to meet their obligations (to Castle) raise substantial doubt about
(Castle's) ability to continue as a going concern.'
If MG Corp does not honour its credit and purchase agreements with Castle,
the company said, it could force Castle into default on a Dollars 120m
long-term credit facility held by the French bank Societe Generale. The MG
affair caused the bank to limit Castle's access to the credits, but not
before Castle had drawn Dollars 93m on the loan.
MG Corp last year not only agreed to purchase all of the output of Castle's
two oil refineries at highly beneficial margins, but entered into a web of
credit arrangements with Castle that closely tie the two company's fates.
Castle has stated it would be unable to repay its loans from operating
revenues and its ability to seek additional financing would be hampered if
MG defaulted on its purchase contracts.
MG's own financing difficulties caused it to constrict the flow of credit to
Castle during December and January, hampering payments to suppliers and
forcing the company to reduce refinery production. MG arranged Dollars 300m
in fresh liquidity from its creditor banks in February, and some of that
money is expected to flow to Castle.
The refiner's financial situation could worsen next month, when it must
begin to make deliveries on a 12-month Dollars 125m forward sale of crude
oil it made in September to an unspecified third party.

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Repola, Finland's largest industrial group, rebounded into the black last
year after much improved performances from its main forestry and engineering
activities.
Profits after financial items were FM428m (Dollars 77m), against a FM810m
deficit in 1992.
The return to profit, after two years of losses, was mainly due to the
weaker Finnish markka and a strong turnround at United Paper Mills, the
forestry unit.
Repola said the result was still unsatisfactory because of poor demand in
Europe and high financing costs but its performance would improve this year
due to lower debt and reduced interest expenses.
Operating profits climbed to FM2.73bn from FM1.72bn on sales of FM25.3bn
against FM23.7bn. Exchange losses wiped FM500m off the result, down from
FM709m, while other financing costs were little changed at FM1.8bn.
UPM contributed FM2.35bn to operating profits, benefiting from cost-cutting,
lower wood prices and the start-up of a new paper mill.
The unit's profit after financial items was FM1.20bn, equal to 7.3 per cent
of net sales of FM16.4bn, compared with a loss of FM350m in 1992 on net
sales of FM14.4bn.
Operating profits at the Rauma engineering unit doubled to FM273m from
FM136m.

<TEXT>
Den Danske Bank, Denmark's largest bank, returned to profit with net
earnings of DKr2.40bn (Dollars 359m) last year after a 1992 loss of
DKr1.73bn. An unchanged DKr12 dividend was proposed, writes Hilary Barnes in
Copenhagen.
The result is in line with market expectations. Earnings last year were
lifted by the value adjustment of the portfolio of bonds, shares and foreign
exchange, which added DKr2.42bn to group profits, against a negative
DKr1.68bn.
But the bank said after eliminating this item, earnings from 'basic banking
business', including bad loss provisions, were up to DKr1.98bn from DKr642m
in 1992, helped by a DKr500m reduction in costs to DKr6.01bn.
Loss provisions remained high at DKr2.83bn, a fall of just DKr100m from
1992.
The bank forecast a further improvement in earnings in 1994 from basic
banking business, with a continued reduction in costs.

Asahi Glass, Japan's largest glass maker, suffered a sharp fall in earnings
as the economic downturn hit demand for glass, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
It reported a 34.4 per cent fall in parent company pre-tax profits for the
year to December to Y26.2bn (Dollars 250m), on a 4.7 per cent decline in
sales to Y964.5bn. After-tax profits fell 24.7 per cent to Y15.4bn.
Sales of glass and construction materials decreased 8.3 per cent to
Y479.4bn. due to sluggish demand for high-performance glass from the
construction industry and fabricated glass from the automobile industry.
On a consolidated basis, Asahi reported a 55 per cent fall in pre-tax
profits to Y20.1bn on a 6.8 per cent decline in sales to Y1,227.3bn.
For the current year Asahi expects the glass market to recover and sees
parent pre-tax profits rising 6.6 per cent to Y28bn on a 0.6 per cent sales
increase to Y970bn.

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tabacalera, Spain's partly-privatised tobacco monopoly, hopes profits will
recover by at least 30 per cent this year after a 47 per cent fall in the
parent company's 1993 pre-tax earnings to Pta10.70bn.
Mr Pedro Perez, chairman, blamed a fall in the volume of the company's
cigarette sales largely on a thriving contraband business, estimated to take
15 per cent of the market, but said a crackdown on smuggling appeared to be
working.
Consolidated group profits plunged to Pta6.71bn (Dollars 48m) from
Pta20.05bn. After tax, the fall was even sharper, with the 1993 result of
Pta3.12bn standing at just a quarter of the previous year's level. Group
sales were almost 5 per cent down at Pta666bn.
This partly reflected disposals in the food sector but also a fall of more
than 7 per cent in the number of cigarettes sold through the group.
The company estimated that 650m packets of cigarettes were being smuggled
into Spain annually, mainly sold through bars and cafes.
Other factors hitting profits were a shift to cheaper brands - reflecting
increased tax on tobacco products - and the increased cost of
dollar-denominated raw materials.
Mr Perez, formerly state secretary for the economy, said he intended to
reduce operating costs by 10 per cent this year.
Tabacalera is 52 per cent owned by the state, with some 38 per cent held by
foreign investors, mainly financial institutions.

FT  28 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Record UK trading in German equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trading of German equities on the London market reached record levels in
1993, according to the Stock Exchange's latest quarterly report, published
today.
The rise was fuelled by the strength across European markets last year,
particularly in the final quarter. The Stock Exchange figures show London
firms accounting for about 10 per cent of the total turnover in German
equities. Total foreign equity trading in London also hit a new high last
year, with Germany the most active, accounting for some 15 per cent by
value.
In a survey of London fund managers, marketmakers and institutional traders,
the Stock Exchange points to several advantages of the London market. London
firms concentrate their business on the top 30 German stocks - known as the
DAX 30 - which trade simultaneously in London and Frankfurt.
The involvement in both markets means that prices are not fragmented and
that any arbitrage opportunities are short-lived. Another perceived
advantage is the competitiveness in both pricing and liquidity provided for
by London's quote-driven system.
Fund managers also emphasised their strong relationship with London-based
traders, together with a growing international bias of their portfolios. For
their part, marketmakers said that their trading skills and the benefits of
running co-ordinated international operations give them a sustainable
competitive edge.
However, all the institutions surveyed also used local German firms, usually
for smaller stocks where they could offer greater liquidity and better
research.
The quarterly survey also shows that 1993 was the first year in which
foreign stocks accounted for over 50 per cent of total London equity
trading.
In the busiest fourth quarter, Japan was the most active sector at 18 per
cent, followed by France (17.4 per cent) and Germany (14.2 per cent).

FT  28 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Epsom contenders enter final furlong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The three remaining con-tenders in the race to own Epsom, home of the Derby,
this morning were entering the final furlong.
They are Racecourse Holdings Trust, owned by the Jockey Club, a consortium
headed by Mr Stan Clarke, owner of Uttoxeter racecourse, and Sunset + Vine,
the sports television company.
The three have to submit their bids for Epsom, together with Sandown Park
and Kempton Park, to Lazard Brothers by 10am this morning. Lazard is acting
for the Horserace Betting Levy Board, the statutory body that has owned the
courses for more than 20 years. Estimates of the value of the three courses
run up to Pounds 30m.
Mr David Hillyard, managing director of Racecourse Holdings Trust, believes
that the trust will be best able to fulfil the obligation on the buyer to
keep horse racing at all three courses.
They lie within London's M25 ring road, and were acquired by the Horserace
Betting Levy Board in order to protect them from possible property
development.
'We have a track record going back 30 years, and, with the Jockey Club as
our parent, we are in the business for the long-term benefit of racing,' he
said.
The trust already owns nine courses, including Cheltenham and Newmarket.
There are 59 horse racing courses in the UK. On Friday, the Office of Fair
Trading gave its clearance to the proposed purchase.
Mr Stan Clarke, who turned round Uttoxeter racecourse from losses five years
ago, is putting in a private bid, along with Mr Anthony Solomons, chairman
of Singer &amp; Friedlander, the merchant banking and property group, and Mr
Andrew Cohen, managing director of Betterware, the home shopping company.
The three men are all racehorse owners.
Mr Clarke was in optimistic mood following the victory of Honest Word, his
wife's horse, in the 3.25pm at Kempton Park on Friday.
Sunset + Vine is expected to make an announcement about its bid this
morning. Mr Colin Frewin, chairman, said yesterday: 'We will be putting in a
visionary document which protects racing and takes it through to the year
2000'.

finance side
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays, the UK clearing bank, yesterday announced the sale of its retail
banking and finance company operations in Australia to the St George Bank,
the New South Wales-based regional bank, for ADollars 190.5m. (Pounds 93.8m)
Barclays, however, will continue to operate as an investment bank in
Australia. It is retaining a range of activities there - including corporate
finance, structured finance, corporate banking, foreign exchange and fund
management. These will now be managed by the BZW division within Barclays.
Simultaneously, Barclays announced that it had been granted branch banking
authority in Australia - one of only a handful of foreign banks to receive
branch banking authority under the Australian government's new foreign bank
policy. The government announced a liberalisation of bank entry in 1992, in
an effort to promote competition in the sector.
Mr Tim Crammond, chief executive of BZW in Australia, said the sale was in
line with Barclays' decision to concentrate on retail banking in the UK,
Europe and Africa, but to have a broader geographical base for its
investment banking operations.
Mr Crammond said that the decision to sell the retail interests had been
'difficult'. 'Divestment of profitable activities is always a hard decision
to make,' he commented.
The businesses being sold had assets of about ADollars 2bn, and made profits
of ADollars 30.4m last year. They include 18 bank branches, mainly in
Sydney's western suburbs. Assets at St George will rise to about ADollars
14.5bn as a result.

FT  28 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Scottish Power in talks over Clydesdale
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Power is negotiating to extend its network of retail stores into
England by buying part of the Clydesdale Group, the Glasgow-based electrical
retailer which went into receivership last month.
It is thought to be interested primarily in Clydesdale's 30 out-of-town
superstores south of the border.
However, the deal is believed to include the 12 superstores in Scotland,
where Scottish Power already has about 30 per cent of the white goods
market, as well as the group's rental business.
Scottish Power's offer has led to the abandonment of a Pounds 46m bid for
the entire group from Clydesdale managers.
This group is not interested in buying Clydesdale's high street shops
without its Scottish superstores and the rental operation. But it hopes
Scottish Power may be forced by the Office of Fair Trading to shed the
Scottish superstores as soon as a deal is concluded, which might enable it
to revive the bid.

FT  28 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Piper European trust to be launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new European smaller companies investment trust aims to raise up to Pounds
50m through a placing and offer for subscription.
Piper European Smaller Companies is being launched by Piper International
Asset Management, the Edinburgh-based fund management subsidiary of the US
Piper Jaffray group.
The trust will invest in European companies, not including the UK, with
market capitalisations of up to Pounds 250m, with the aim of achieving
long-term capital growth.
The trust will be managed to qualify for investment via a personal equity
plan.
Managers of the fund say they believe the time is right to launch a European
smaller companies fund because of rising economic growth in Europe, and the
tendency of smaller companies to outperform larger companies at times of
economic growth.
As yet, there are relatively few investment trusts specialising in this
area.
The team of managers were all formerly with N Dunn &amp; Co, a small fund
management company which was recently acquired by Piper.
Ordinary shares in the trust will be offered at 100p, with one warrant
attached to every five shares.

FT  28 FEB 94 / UK Company News: UPF to float with Pounds 60m tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
United Pressings and Fabrications, the vehicle chassis manufacturer which
was sold off by the collapsed Parkfield group in 1990, is to return to the
stock market with a flotation valuing it at over Pounds 60m.
The company produces chassis frames for car manufacturers including
Rolls-Royce, Rover and General Motors. It also makes pressings and
assemblies, mainly for the car and domestic appliance industries.
UPF reported Pounds 4.2m profit on turnover of Pounds 35m in the year to
August 1993, but is anticipating 'significant growth' in the current year.
It was bought from Parkfield's receivers in August 1990, in a Pounds 30m
management buy-out.
Phildrew Ventures, and a number of other venture capital groups, took 80 per
cent of the company and the management acquired the remaining 20 per cent.
The company subsequently sold off its steel wheel manufacturing subsidiary
for Pounds 6.3m and following further restructuring, the management now owns
8 per cent, while Phildrew holds 59 per cent.
Thompson Chassis, its most profitable division, has been the sole
manufacturer of frame assemblies for Rolls-Royce cars since 1908. It also
manufactured Sir Malcolm Campbell's Bluebird, which broke the world land
speed record in the 1930s.
UPF is aiming to launch its flotation this summer. UBS will act as financial
adviser.

FT  28 FEB 94 / UK Company News: WH Smith music merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WH Smith, the retail and distribution group, is close to reaching a deal on
merging its Our Price record chain with Virgin Retail, Smith's 50-50 joint
venture with Mr Richard Branson's Virgin group.
The move - which may be announced this week - will create the UK's biggest
music retailer, with sales of Pounds 350m, or about 20 per cent of the
market.
WH Smith is expected to take a further 25 per cent in Virgin Retail,
increasing its stake to 75 per cent, and transfer all 305 Our Price stores
into the joint venture. The enlarged group will be managed by Virgin
Retail's existing management, headed by Mr Simon Burke, managing director.
Although they have been run by separate management teams, the development of
Virgin Megastores and Our Price outlets has been carefully co-ordinated
since Virgin and WH Smith formed their joint venture in 1991.
The 24-store Megastore chain has concentrated on central sites in large
towns and cities - with an eventual target of about 35 stores - while Our
Price has been aimed at smaller catchment areas.
WH Smith is now thought to see advantages in integrating the two chains
under one management, and to be keen to increase Our Price's share of the
home entertainment market. After the merger, Our Price is likely to continue
its recent programme of expanding its range of home entertainment products,
especially computer games.
WH Smith does not report separate results for Our Price, but it is thought
to have lost money in the year to May 1993, but returned to profit this
year. Profits at Virgin Retail this year are expected to exceed Pounds 4m,
on sales of Pounds 120m.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Company News (This Week): Eyes on the dividend after a heady
leap - HSBC Holdings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Only 18 months after coming to the UK with its acquisition of Midland Bank,
HSBC Holdings finds itself the second largest company in Britain by market
value. This heady leap up the FT-SE 100 index has come mainly through its
exposure to the booming Asia Pacific market.
When it announces results today, there will be strong interest in the
dividend level. The poor reception of National Westminster Bank's results
was attributed partly to a payout increase of only 6 per cent, compared with
20 per cent from Lloyds Bank.
HSBC is among the most strongly capitalised of the UK banks, and with
analysts expecting a rise of a third in pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.3bn,
against Pounds 1.71bn, there are strong dividend hopes. A cautious move
could affect investor sentiment towards the sector.
Within the results, the previously troubled banking arms in Australia and
the US have already reported on their recovery, so most attention will be
focused on Asia and on Midland. The UK bank is expected to have more than
doubled the previous year's Pounds 315m profit figure.
One strategic question for HSBC is the extent to which it can form a strong
global investment bank through the fusion of James Capel, its agency broking
arm in London, and the primary sides of Wardley in Asia and Samuel Montagu
in London.
There will be continued interest in the degree to which HSBC has solved a
previously accident-prone image with its overseas acquisitions. Although
most retail banking operations are now under firm control, analysts expect
further provisions against losses at Concord Leasing in the US.
Another possible area of anxiety is the group's exposure to the Hong Kong
property market, which some fear is over-heated. The group showed signs at
the half year of limiting asset growth in the territory to reduce risks.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Company News (This Week): Return to the black after the dark
years - Philips
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On Thursday, long-suffering shareholders in Philips, the Dutch electronics
group, will find out whether they can expect to receive a dividend this year
 -for the first time since the company fell into difficulties in 1990 and
embarked on its 'Centurion' restructuring programme.
An immediate resumption of the Fl 2.00 per share paid out of 1989 profits
will not be possible, but there may be room for around Fl 0.50.
Philips will certainly report a profit, with the help of a Fl 1.1bn (Pounds
383m) gain on the sale of its 35 per cent stake in Matsushita Electronics
Corp, a joint venture with Matsushita of Japan. This will more than reverse
the previous year's net loss of Fl 900m.
Even without one-off items, Philips is expected to post a net profit of Fl
500m-Fl 850m. Much will depend on whether Christmas shoppers stocked up on
consumer electronics products. That division is expected to have remained
loss-making in 1993, although break-even is in sight.
A big question is how many consumers have been tempted to buy two new
offerings: the digital compact cassette (DCC) and compact disc-interactive,
a multi-media version of the CD player.
Philips should be aided by robust results from PolyGram, its 75 per
cent-owned music and film company, reporting in London today.

FT  28 FEB 94 / A reworking of television characters: A look at what is in
store for LWT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Weekend Television's future as a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Granada group begins this morning at 9am.
Sir Christopher Bland, chairman of LWT, the London ITV company which
succumbed on Friday to Granada's Pounds 760m hostile bid, will go to the
victors' Golden Square headquarters to meet Granada chief executive, Mr
Gerry Robinson. There he will resign.
'I think that's the correct protocol,' said Sir Christopher.
Mr Robinson placed a heavy emphasis on conciliation yesterday and there was
no sign of a blueprint drawn up for LWT by Mr Charles Allen, chief executive
of Granada Television. During the battle, Granada executives pointed to a
plan which suggested that younger managers would be promoted, while many of
the LWT millionaire managers might have more time to enjoy their wealth.
'People think that somehow on Monday morning Granada will be over the walls
at LWT and in there hacking around. It could not be further from the truth,'
said Mr Allen. This week will see the start of talks on how to integrate two
of the UK's main commercial television operations, he added.
It had been agreed all along that there would be no place for Sir
Christopher. He will hold Granada shares worth around Pounds 14m. 'I am a
bigger shareholder than either Gerry Robinson or Alex Bernstein (Granada
chairman) in the company and I hope they look after my investment with
care,' Sir Christopher said.
The key to what happens next is the position of Mr Greg Dyke, LWT chief
executive. He is seen as one of the most talented ITV executives but is now
independently wealthy with Granada shares worth around Pounds 9m. 'With Greg
on board we are likely to have a much, much better feel for the people
within the company. How it will go without him will obviously be much more
difficult to tell. Our starting point is that we hope that he will stay,'
said Mr Robinson.
He admits he does not have anyone else lined up if the LWT chief executive
decides he does not want to work for a subsidiary of Granada. Over the
weekend many LWT staff urged Mr Dyke to stay and Sir Christopher believes Mr
Dyke can reach agreement with Granada.
Whoever runs the weekend ITV company, which will almost certainly continue
to be called London Weekend Television, costs will have to be cut and jobs
will have to go.
Cost cuts, however, will be modest compared with the scale of the deal -
perhaps up to Pounds 10m a year - and the job losses, as yet unquantified,
are likely to come from removing duplication.
'The arguments were always strategic ones and that remains,' said Mr
Robinson who founded his case for the takeover on the belief that larger
groupings were necessary and inevitable in the increasingly competitive
world of commercial television.
The studio complexes in both Manchester and London will be retained and the
existing LWT specialisation in light entertainment and Granada's emphasis on
serial drama such as Coronation Street will continue. Some LWT drama which
now goes out to independent producers could in future be made in-house in
Granada's television 'factory' in Manchester. Granada will also be 'having a
very good look at production' and how programmes could be made for
international markets as well as for ITV.
'Programme making is going to be a real business in its own right and as the
largest player in the UK after the BBC we should be capable of doing a lot
with it,' forecast Mr Robinson.
The final irony is that the Granada victory finally overturns LWT's main
argument against the rental and leisure group that television was only a
small part of Granada's operations. Following the takeover of LWT,
television will account for more than one third of the Granada business.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Independent likely to favour all-cash MGN bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle for The Independent newspaper is expected to enter its final
phase either today or tomorrow with the likelihood that an improved bid by
the consortium which includes Mirror Group Newspapers will be recommended by
the board.
The improved deal, being worked on by lawyers last night, would add a full
cash alternative to match or come close to MGN's existing Pounds 3.50 offer
in cash and shares.
Mr Ian Hay Davison, chairman of Newspaper Publishing, the company that owns
both The Independent and the Independent on Sunday, has been determined that
all institutional shareholders should have an equal chance of getting out of
the company.
Although Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman of Independent Newspapers of Ireland,
offered Pounds 3.50 in cash for his initial 24.9 per cent stake, last week's
offer from the MGN consortium still only had a cash alternative of Pounds
2.50.
If the MGN consortium comes up with a full cash alternative, the
non-executive directors of Newspaper Publishing will recommend the offer.
The other members of the consortium are El Pais of Spain, La Repubblica of
Italy and the founders of The Independent, led by Mr Andreas Whittam Smith
Lawyers were also working last night on the precise form of guarantees of
editorial independence. MGN has already said it will not vote on hiring or
firing of editors and will allow the Spanish and Italian newspaper groups
together to have a voting majority in the company.
Under the plan now emerging, the stake of the founders would come down from
10 per cent to 3 per cent. The shares would be sold to MGN making it the
second-largest shareholder with 27 per cent. El Pais and La Repubblica would
each have 20 per cent.
Even if the bid is recommended, Mr O'Reilly who now controls 29.9 per cent
of the company could return with a higher bid but he has always said it was
unlikely he would mount a full takeover.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Italy to sell off BCI at 5% discount
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN SIMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian government has set a price of L5,400 a share on the public offer
which gets under way today of 54 per cent of shares in Banca Commerciale
Italiana (BCI), one of the country's most prestigious banks.
This represents a discount of just 5.3 per cent on Friday's average price of
L5,904, after deducting the recently announced L200 dividend which buyers
will not receive,
The state holding group, IRI, which is shedding its last significant
interest in the banking sector by disposing of its entire stake in BCI,
expects to raise L2,900bn (Pounds 1.16bn) from the sale of 260m shares to
private investors and 240m to institutions.
Although the discount is below that set on two recent bank privatisations -
nearly 10 per cent for Credito Italiano and 6 per cent for the financial
services group Istituto Mobiliare Italiano - it values the bank at close to
its net worth.
There is some disappointment at the size of the discount, but the Italian
privatisation bandwagon has gathered such pace that analysts still expect
the offer to be over-subscribed.
The offer could close tomorrow, instead of the scheduled close on Friday. Mr
Romano Prodi, IRI's chairman, said that demand was 10 times the offer.
BCI's share price has surged in recent weeks, touching a high of more than
L6,200. The sell-off of BCI, which ranks among the top half-dozen of Italian
banks in terms of assets, is the biggest of the bank privatisations.
Earlier this month BCI reported group net profits of L301.2bn, up 37.8 per
cent.
Heavy turnover in the shares on the Milan bourse has fuelled rumours that a
group of institutions is manoeuvring to build a sizeable stake, with a view
to eventual control.
Generali, Italy's biggest insurance group, has said it has taken a 2.6 per
cent stake. This has focused attention on the role of the powerful
Milan-based Mediobanca, which has links with Generali and other institutions
believed to be showing interest in BCI.
As with previous privatisations, the BCI sell-off offers an incentive price
of L4,860 for the 40m shares reserved for employees, reflecting Mr Prodi's
wishes for a wide spread of ownership. This sentiment is shared by a wide
spectrum of political parties. With the election campaign now in full swing,
the emergence of a hard core of stake-builders would prove controversial.

On Wednesday, the engineering and industrial services group is expected to
report a 20 per cent decline in profits for 1993. The group hinted at a
Pounds 97m pre-tax figure - down from Pounds 121.8m - three weeks ago when
it launched a contested Pounds 497m bid for Westland, the UK's only
helicopter manufacturer.
Sir David Lees, GKN chairman, has blamed the decline on redundancy and
restructuring costs of some Pounds 20m and an exceptional Pounds 11m charge.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On Tuesday, Abbey National is likely to show a steadier increase in 1993
profits than the UK's other banks because it does not have the same exposure
to past bad debts from corporate lending.
With the pre-tax figure forecast to rise to about Pounds 700m, from Pounds
564m, most attention will focus on the dividend increase, which some
analysts are expecting to be generous.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Aluminium producers face more cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The aluminium industry faces a trade war that will last for years if the
unprecedented international deal between the main aluminium-producing
countries to cut global output does not succeed, according to Mr Bernard
Legrand, head of aluminium activities at Pechiney, Europe's biggest
producer.
He delivered this message as representatives of producer governments met in
Ottawa, Canada, to assess progress made since January when they decided in
Brussels to bring the market back into balance. They agreed to cut about 10
per cent, or between 1.5m and 2m tonnes, from the world's aluminium annual
production for 18 months to two years.
Mr Legrand said that conditions had deteriorated since the targets were
first set in November and the industry now needed annual cuts of at least 2m
tonnes for two years.
That would be almost impossible without a contribution from the three big
producing regions not represented at Brussels: Brazil, the Gulf States and
Venezuela. Between them these account for about 2.7m tonnes or 16 per cent
of capacity outside the Commonwealth of Independent States.
'Cuts of 2m tonnes mean that everyone in the industry must contribute, there
is no room for any producer to stand back and watch others make the
running,' said Mr Legrand.
The Ottawa meeting could make formal moves to draw these regions into the
scheme, which at present encompasses Australia, Canada, the 12-nation
European Union negotiating as one, Norway, Russia and the US.
Since the Brussels meeting, producers in the west have announced about
850,000 tonnes of annual production cuts.
Russia has offered to cut 300,000 tonnes by the end of April and another
200,000 in the following three months. Mr Legrand said: 'I am pretty
confident Russia will keep its word.'
Producers have been rewarded by seeing the price of aluminium on the London
Metal Exchange moving up by nearly a third, from under Dollars 1,000 a tonne
in December to more than Dollars 1,300.

FT  28 FEB 94 / G7 warns embattled Yeltsin to maintain reforms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Russia's rulers floundered in angry embarrassment yesterday as the freed
leaders of last October's bloody parliamentary uprising taunted the
president who thought he had put them in jail for years.
Under severe political pressure following the release of his enemies,
President Boris Yeltsin was also given a blunt warning by his western allies
at the weekend to maintain the pace of economic reform in Russia despite the
recent departure of leading reformers from government.
The Group of Seven industrialised states, meeting near Frankfurt at the
weekend, warned Moscow it must reach agreement with the International
Monetary Fund on stabilising inflation and the government deficit before any
further debt rescheduling could be negotiated.
In Moscow, Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, Mr Yeltsin's press spokesman, described
the decision to free the leaders of the October uprising as 'sacrilege' and
the parliament which made it as 'an accomplice in lawlessness'.
Mr Kostikov, who is prone to make threats exceeding the Russian leader's
appetite for action, said Mr Yeltsin 'reserved the right to act in
accordance with the constitutional powers he is entrusted with' - a possible
reference to his right to impose a state of emergency in situations of
national danger.
Mr Alexander Rutskoi, the former vice-president, who came out of jail
wearing his full general's uniform despite the fact that he was stripped of
his rank for leading the uprising, has given himself two weeks to decide
whether he plans to run for president in 1996.
The tough G7 line on insisting that Russia agree with the IMF before any new
round of official debt rescheduling in the Paris Club emerged from
Saturday's meeting between the G7 finance ministers and central bank
governors, and a Russian delegation headed by Mr Sergei Dubinin, the acting
finance minister.
It will put the new Russian government under pressure to reach a deal with
the IMF on the conditions for the release of a second Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds
1bn) tranche of its special transformation facility and a Dollars 4.1bn
stand-by credit.
Philip Stephens adds: Arriving in Washington early this morning, Mr John
Major, the prime minister, emphasised that the west must continue to support
Mr Yeltsin. In talks today with President Bill Clinton, he will urge
Washington to speed plans to offer Mr Yeltsin a stronger partnership with
Nato and a formal role in G7 summits.

The European Union was last night preparing to conclude talks with Sweden
and Finland on EU entry by 1995, threatening to leave Austria and Norway to
join later if they cannot meet the negotiating deadline of midnight tonight.
Mr Alain Lamasourre, French European affairs minister, said: 'There comes a
point at which you have to say no more bets, and the wheel stops turning.'
At the same time, Mr Theodoros Pangalos, the Greek current chairman of the
EU Council of Ministers, warned the UK and Spain that they were jeopardising
EU expansion by refusing to change the 12's weighted-majority voting rules
to accommodate the newcomers.
Mr Pangalos turned the screws on Austria and Norway, saying the union was
sticking to the February 28 deadline for a deal to get the four candidates
in by January next year. The deadline allows for only a little slippage if
the European Parliament is to deliver its mandatory ratification before it
submits itself for re-election this June.
'I think it's possible for a number of countries' to come in on the fast
track, Mr Pangalos said, in a clear reference to Sweden and Finland, adding
that 'those who don't make it will have to stay (negotiating) for the next
parliament'.
As negotiations among the 12 EU members and between them and the four
applicants wore into the night, there was some prospect of an agreement
today on an aid regime for highly subsidised Nordic and Alpine farmers.
However, Mr Heikki Haavisto, Finnish foreign minister and farmers' leader,
insisted that 'we have no reason to be optimistic'.
Germany was chairing negotiations with Norway to try to break the impasse
over Spanish demands for access to Norwegian fish - flatly refused by Oslo -
and Norwegian demands for full and immediate access for its fish products
within the EU - unacceptable to France and likely to be widely resisted
unless Norway consents to contribute to the EU fisheries resources pool.
Austria reported some progress on its demand that restrictions on EU trucks
crossing its Alpine passes should stay for 10 more years. But it refuses to
go along with the 12's plans for immediate alignment of farm prices to EU
levels. 'For us this is a very big psychological problem,' one Austrian
negotiator said.
On the voting rules controversy, Mr Pangalos said the UK and Spain 'will
take responsibility for the political failure of enlargement' if they
continue to insist on no change in the so-called 'blocking minority'.
At present, 23 votes out of 76 - normally meaning two large and one small
member states - can block legislation in the Council of Ministers. If all
four applicants enter, the 16 would share 90 votes, and a Benelux-inspired
majority wants to maintain the balance between big and small EU club members
by requiring 27 votes to block proposals.
Talks broke off late last night and are to resume this morning.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Accountancy firms 'should be monitored by single watchdog'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's three regulatory bodies for auditors should be merged and subject
to independent public scrutiny, according to a confidential report
commissioned by the government.
The report says the current system for monitoring accountancy firms will do
little to improve the practices of the larger firms.
The draft report, which was submitted to the Department of Trade and
Industry late last month, was written by Mr Peter Moizer, professor of
accounting at the University of Leeds.
Ministers commissioned the report to assess the effectiveness of the first
two years of the system of self-regulation which was established by law in
1989.
The regulation of the profession's standards is split between three bodies.
The Joint Monitoring Unit examines the work of all the larger accounting
firms, which audit nearly all public limited companies. The unit is
controlled by the UK's three institutes of chartered accountants.
The other regulators are the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants
and the Association of Authorised Public Accountants.
The report says ideally there should be only one body to regulate the
professsion as the split between the regulators, which act as commercial
rivals, is inappropriate, wasteful and not the best way to improve the
quality of auditing. It calls for the creation of a body similar to the
Public Oversight Board which has operated in the US since 1977, which would
deal with customer complaints and produce an annual review of the
regulator's work.
The report says that short of radical reform, the Joint Monitoring Unit run
by the institutes of chartered accountants should follow the approach of the
other regulatory bodies, which are more effective.
The Moizer study says the unit spends more time on each visit to auditors
than the certified accountants' regulators, costs more, is less flexible and
is seen as more threatening by the firms being examined.
It recommends the unit should increase the number of annual visits so that
it matchs the other regulators by inspecting all firms in its jurisdiction
within the next five years, and then target those which are likely to be
higher risk.
Under the existing procedures, the unit examines a sample of firms each year
to draw general lessons which it can use to educate others.
At the current pace, it would take 50 years for all accountancy firms to be
visited.
The report also recommends that there is an urgent need for an authoritative
statement on how auditors should deal with problems peculiar to small
companies.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Debate about the liability of accountants for the errors of their ways seems
to be hotting up again. Claims against accountancy firms are rising, yet the
alarm felt by the profession may not play to a wider audience. Indeed,
rather the reverse. Ever since the Law Lords handed largesse to the
accountants by deciding that auditors were not accountable to individual
shareholders, a backlash has been in prospect. A nebulous duty to
shareholders as a group is all but useless, since they cannot sue
collectively. Shareholders want a better grip on auditors.
The profession's case is not helped by the fact that poor audits and
negligence have been widespread. Large firms have driven for market share in
audits in the hope that they can gain clients for other services. That
competition has put pressure on audit fees. In some cases audits have become
loss-leaders, and the temptation has been to maintain margins by using
inexpensive trainees. Mistakes have become more likely.
The contention that one of the big partnerships may be broken by these
rising claims is impossible to test, since none reveal their financial
position in any detail. Accountants may want to cap their liabilities or
restrict them to the elements for which they are directly responsible. For
that the very least they will have to cede is a concrete duty to
shareholders and greater openness about their financial affairs.

FT  28 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Food manufacturers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Unilever's Pounds 490m restructuring charge throws up further worries about
UK food manufacturers as they steady their nerves to report results. If one
of the world's strongest consumer products companies continues to apply the
squeeze to costs it would be fair to assume that its lesser rivals will have
to follow. The fear is that such exceptional restructuring charges may
become a permanent feature of the sector - which raises the question whether
they should be regarded as exceptional at all. In the squeaky new world of
FRS3 accounting, it makes little difference given such charges have to be
taken above the line. But it provides another reason for believing the
sector's earnings are likely to remain dull for the foreseeable future.
That said, many UK food manufacturers rationalised capacity savagely
throughout the 1980s as retailers applied the cosh. Moreover, much of
Unilever's charge relates to the US detergents market where Procter &amp; Gamble
has been muddying the water. The rate of technological obsolescence in that
business is certainly higher than that for bread and butter.
Food manufacturers retain some defensive charms, given that the sector
yields close to 4 per cent. They also account for five of the 10
highest-yielding stocks in the FT-SE 350, while the last time any one of
them cut their dividend was back in 1978. Still, dividends have to be paid
out of earnings at the end of the day. Food manufacturers must show how they
can grow.

FT  28 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Kingfisher
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The derating of Kingfisher's shares since the start of the year has been
savage. From their high at the turn of the year the shares have fallen by
some 25 per cent. In part that reflects an equally over-enthusiastic run up
in the shares before Christmas. It is also a response to the disappointing
Christmas trading statement in January and the persistent worry that there
is something nasty in the Woolworths woodshed.
Perhaps most serious is the concern that the religion of 'Everyday Low
Pricing' preached by Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, Kingfisher's chairman, may not be
working. The idea that a combination of lower margins, better ranges and
improved service can generate sufficient market share gains to offset its
costs and increase profits is seductive. But ELP is complex to operate and
requires investment in sophisticated systems, an area in which Kingfisher
lagged in the past. Adopting ELP certainly helped Kingfisher stop the
guerrilla price war in do-it-yourself. It may also have been an attempt to
pre-empt the arrival of US retailers like Home Depot in the UK. Still, it is
not clear that Kingfisher has accepted the full implications and costs of
the direction it has chosen.
Mr Alan Smith was brought in as chief executive from Marks and Spencer a
year ago, partly to help improve Kingfisher's systems and distribution.
Little has seen of him since. If the market's faith in Sir Geoff's vision is
to be restored, a clearer view is needed of how the ELP strategy is to be
implemented. Outstanding questions include: how far and fast and into which
of Kingfisther's businesses will ELP be introduced. The presentation of its
full-year figures next month would seem as good an opportunity as any to
provide the answers.

FT  28 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Banking on BCI's appeal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
By offering shares in Banca Commerciale Italiana at a 5.3 per cent discount
to the market price, the Italian government is showing growing confidence.
The privatisations of Credito Italiano in December and IMI last month were
both heavily oversubscribed. The rise in Credito's shares since then must
have made some in government wonder whether the 10 per cent discount for
that offer was, in retrospect, too generous.
While Credito's shares stood close to a 12-month low when its offer was
priced, though, BCI has risen by 25 per cent this year to an all-time high.
Credito was trading at a discount to net assets in December, while BCI is
trading at around book value. On that basis BCI is being offered at nothing
like a bargain basement price. Like Credito, BCI's interest margins are
being squeezed by lower short-term interest rates. It faces the similar
challenge of keeping operating expenses under control while developing new
sources of income, primarily by selling financial services through an
expanding branch network. The promise of 20 per cent annual growth in fee
income will be difficult to fulfil.
With lower exposure to celebrated corporate collapses such as Ferruzzi, BCI
arguably has the edge in terms of asset quality. That said, its relatively
low level of provisioning might leave less scope for earnings growth as the
Italian economy turns and the bad debt situation improves. Given the
interest shown in Credito and IMI, it is difficult to believe that BCI will
be anything other than oversubscribed. Neither would it do to count on a
windfall profit.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
But now for a bank that has at least got something right.
For, in this age of high-powered manipulative image-making, it's a rare
treat indeed to discover a low-key corporate PR tool which has served its
purpose for 75 years, and is still going strong.
The Royal Bank Letter, published six times a year by Royal Bank of Canada,
is more akin to Reader's Digest - without the ads - than a corporate
brochure. It carries the bank's logo but otherwise eschews suggestions of
anything so vulgar as a sales pitch.
Instead, the four-page essays - sent free to readers - deal with such homely
and safe subjects as science in our lives; middle age; strength of
character; and 'the civilised workplace'.
Royal Bank tried to save money in the early 1980s by culling the subscriber
list - to no avail. Circulation has soared from 100,000 to 270,000 in the
past decade. Most newspapers can only look on in wonderment.

Most high street bank customers can warm to the subject of slipping
standards of service, but it seems that the deep pile carpet at even the
most recherche private bank is also wearing distinctly thin.
C. Hoare &amp; Co's worthy 322-year-old tradition certainly proved cold comfort
to one customer of 35 years' standing who decided to vote with his feet
after being informed, by letter, that the rate on his overdraft would be
soaring to 7 per cent over base.
His account had dipped Pounds 20,000 into the red, a not uncommon
occurrence, and hardly a vast sum considering that the bank held
title deeds to his house as well as sundry life policies with a combined
worth well over Pounds 1m. He admits he had moved his securities portfolio,
over which the bank used to have a charge, to his stockbroker for ease of
administration, but that had been nearly 12 months previously.
To add insult to injury, that discreet personal service for which he had
long paid so dearly ran to a distant 'Dear Sir' atop the offending missive.

is a full partner with British Rail and France's SNCF in European Passenger
Services, which will run through-trains between London, Paris and Brussels.
Yet passenger signs at London's new Waterloo International terminal are in

Belgians.
Come to think about it, there are no signs in Welsh or Gaelic either ..

FT  28 FEB 94 / Observer: In the swim at Saatchis
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Australian Bill Muirhead may not care to be reminded of a touching story
from his early days at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. Not long after Muirhead stepped
aboard 23 years ago, Maurice Saatchi was looking for a way to thank the
promising new account executive. On the assumption that all antipodeans need
swimming pools, Saatchi apparently dispatched someone to measure up the
garden - of Muirhead's Bromley semi.
Since risen to become chairman and chief executive of the group's London
agency, Muirhead is again being rewarded for the good job he has done.
Saatchis has just emerged top of the billings class among UK agencies for
1993 and Muirhead is now off across the Atlantic to knock heads together as
chief executive of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi North America.
A 'foreigner' on Madison Avenue is still something of a novelty and it
remains to be seen whether Muirhead's abrasive style will be quite what is
needed to help discourage yet more clients heading for the door of the
struggling US operation.
Many of the difficulties are structural anyway, with the biggest blue chips
fundamentally rethinking their advertising strategies.
Also, despite the best efforts of group chief executive Charlie Scott, there
is still a pretty intractable overhead problem - a legacy of the good, or
bad, old 1980s - as amply demonstrated by the Pounds 4m pay-off of
Muirhead's predecessor, Bob Kennedy, after his 12-month crack at the job.
Muirhead's own package, at least, is reckoned to be a good couple of
swimming pools short of the Kennedy league.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Leading Article: False moves in Malaysia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Malaysia believes that by banning British bidders from government contracts
it can teach the UK a political lesson. From the anguished reaction of
several large British companies, Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime
minister, may be tempted to conclude that the tactic has worked. However,
his action is a two-edged sword. While it may cause Britain some temporary
problems, it risks doing longer-lasting damage to Malaysia's international
reputation and economic development.
The ban was imposed not in response to any transgression by the British
government in the Pergau dam controversy, but was explicitly intended to
retaliate against reporting of the affair by the British press and, in
particular, against allegations that bribes were offered to Malaysian
politicians. This displays both extreme sensitivity to criticism and a
refusal to acknowledge the way that democracy works in western countries.
British law entitles newspapers to publish what they believe to be the
truth. It also entitles those who believe they have been libelled to sue. If
Dr Mahathir has a legitimate grievance, that is the course he should have
taken.
His failure to do so may reflect how far his government has grown used to a
tame local press, kept in its place by strict controls. Such policies,
common in much of Asia, are often defended on the grounds that they preserve
'Asian values' against undesirable western influences. In practice, they too
often suit narrow government interests. By shielding governments from
uncomfortable truths, they can encourage a myopic view of the world.
Impressive strides
This holds dangers for Malaysia, which aims to become fully industrialised
by 2020. It is to Dr Mahathir's credit that it has made impressive strides
towards that goal, replacing traditional dependence on exports of
commodities with exports of manufactures, including electronics and cars.
Its recent growth has averaged 8 per cent annually, and unemployment has
been almost eradicated.
These achievements have depended on access to developed markets and inward
investment, much of them from western and Japanese multinational companies.
Awareness of this dependence has prompted the government both to champion
the virtues of multilateral trade, while criticising the US pursuit of
unilateral policies towards Japan, and to liberalise its own economy. For
Malaysia now to resort to the bilateralism it condemns in others is
inconsistent.
Fiercer competition
It may also prove damaging. Multinational investment has been drawn to
Malaysia primarily by its relatively low labour costs and recent political
stability. However, the former advantage is being eroded by rising wage
costs and fiercer competition for investment from countries such as China.
In response, Malaysia is seeking to upgrade its economy by stressing more
sophisticated activities, including information services. It can only
succeed by attracting further investment from multinational companies. To
judge by last year's sharp drop in inward investment, some may already be
rethinking their commitment to its economy. The government's short-sighted
behaviour last week will scarcely encourage them to locate commercially
sensitive operations dependent on free information flows in Malaysia.
That this action may rebound on Malaysia does not exonerate the British
government's handling of the Pergau dam affair. The essential charge is one
of hypocrisy. UK policy forbids the linking of development aid to weapons
deals. Yet aid for the dam was at one stage tied to Pounds 1bn in arms
sales. Even after ministers told Malaysia there could be no formal link,
talks on both deals continued in parallel. The moral case for the UK's aid
programme has been undermined, while export prospects have been damaged, in
the end, rather than helped.
Britain needs to establish a clearer separation between aid policies, which
should be dedicated to fostering economic development in the world's poorest
countries, and subsidies to UK exporters. This division needs to be
reinforced by stronger and more transparent procedures. If ministers
override rules, they should at least be required to explain why they have
done so.
For the UK, the essential lesson is that daylight is the best regulator. For
Malaysia, it is that joining the club of industrialised countries requires
more than a narrow focus on GNP growth. It also means tolerating, if not
actually embracing, the constitutional freedoms which go with economic
maturity. This is where Malaysia's true self-interest lies.

FT  28 FEB 94 / 'Austrian' recipe for prosperity: For an antidote to
American economic correctness, Michael Prowse examines an intriguing
counter-culture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you want to be 'economically correct', order this year's Economic Report
of the President. You will learn from President Clinton's Council of
Economic Advisers that increases in tax rates need not undermine economic
incentives, that numerical targets for imports can be preferable to free
trade, and that government intervention is often necessary to correct
'market failures'.
This casual rejection of free market orthodoxy will not raise eyebrows in
most US or British universities. In academia, the influence of Milton
Friedman and other members of the 'Chicago School' has been on the wane for
nearly a decade. Even before Mr Clinton's election victory, the most
influential school in the US was the neo-Keynesian, technocratic brand of
economics taught at universities such as Harvard and the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
Yet the range of economic opinion in the US is still encouragingly wide.
There are many able - if unsung - American economists who reject both
neo-Keynesian orthodoxy and crude free market monetarism. 'Austrian'
followers of F A Hayek and Ludwig von Mises constitute one of the most
intriguing counter-cultures.
The 'Austrian school' was founded in the 1870s by Carl Menger, the great
19th-century economist. But it long ago slipped its Viennese moorings.
Today, most German-speaking economists regard themselves as part of the
Anglo-American economic mainstream. Austrians have a niche position in the
US largely due to the efforts of Mises, who was driven to New York in 1940
by the rise of Nazism. Mises was the undisputed leader of the Austrian
school during the interwar years; young Hayek one of his star pupils.
During the 1950s and 1960s, Mises attracted a new band of American
disciples, the most important being Israel Kirzner, who heads a team of
Austrian theorists at New York University, and Murray Rothbard, now at the
University of Nevada. There are centres of Austrian research scattered
across the US, for example at the Mises Institute in Alabama, at George
Mason University near Washington DC and at Hillsdale College in Michigan.
Austrian economists are spread thinly. But they pop up in surprising places.
There are sympathisers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and, perhaps,
even at the Fed's headquarters in Washington: Mr Alan Greenspan's speeches
occasionally have an Austrian tinge. In Britain leading Austrians include
Stephen Littlechild, the regulator of the power industry.
Before looking at Austrian theories, a word of warning is appropriate.
Austrians pride themselves on their realism: they seek to analyse market
capitalism as it is, not as it might be. As a result, the novelty of their
approach is not always obvious to lay people. The real significance of
Austrian economics can be grasped only by contrasting it with the
'mainstream' economics taught in most universities. Believe it or not, the
latter is often only tenuously related to real-world business.
In recent decades, mainstream economists - in common with other social
scientists - have tried to gain respectability by acquiring the trappings of
a 'hard' science, such as physics. We are all familiar with the huge
computer models used to generate those comically inaccurate economic
'forecasts'. But, in truth, maths is now central to every aspect of academic
economics.
Human beings are treated as though they were robot calculators, forever
maximising profits or 'utility' subject to known (or at least precisely
quantifiable) constraints. Prices are assumed to move rapidly to bring
supply and demand into balance so that markets are always at or close to
'equilibrium'. The upshot is that all the complexities and uncertainties of
a market economy are reduced to a series of neat equations.
This makes economics look more sophisticated than in the days of Adam Smith
(or even John Maynard Keynes). But is the pretension to scientific
understanding justified? Can the kind of maths used to describe the natural
world really be brought to bear on the decisions of human beings? Is
economics really this tractable?
Austrians think not. In real science, there are plenty of 'constants' -
precise relationships confirmed by numerous experiments. After decades of
effort, Rothbard points out, economists have not come up with a single
'economic constant'. All they can ever say is that certain relationships
held at certain times in certain places. The crucial difference is that
human beings can (and frequently do) alter their behaviour - an option not
open to planets or atoms.
Eschewing higher maths, modern Austrians, such as Kirzner, advocate an
alternative economic paradigm that lays greater stress on the role of
entrepreneurs as the driving force of capitalism and on markets as dynamic
processes that facilitate innovation and discovery. To put it bluntly,
Kirzner creates room for such real-world phenomena as Rupert Murdoch, the
Australian media tycoon. By contrast, the insipid world of mainstream
economics could be populated entirely by intelligent computers. The
difference between Austrian and mainstream economics is the difference
between a creative art and a dull, predictable science.
Kirzner follows Mises in putting entrepreneurs at the centre of economic
action. Mises (see Human Action, Yale University Press, 1949) was always
unhappy with the conventional model of economic man as a kind of 'robot
maximiser'. He felt it was simply incorrect to depict most economic
decisions as a matter of routine optimisation subject to known constraints.
He realised that business is a creative activity involving inspired hunches
and leaps of faith.
According to Mises, all you can assume is that people, facing a radically
uncertain future, try to improve their material lot. They act purposefully
to 'remove felt uneasiness'. But Misesian 'human action' does not assume
anybody will optimise anything: he thus dispenses with most of the complex
maths that clutters modern textbooks.
'We are all entrepreneurs,' was one of Mises's favourite slogans. What he
meant was that all economic activity is inherently entrepreneurial because
it occurs in conditions of uncertainty. When we buy a house or choose a
career we have to take a gamble. We have to make assumptions about future
real estate prices or wages that may or may not be justified. If we guess
correctly we prosper, but there is always a risk of disappointment.
Mises saw all economics in this light. Business tycoons are really no
different from you or me. They gamble that the price at which they can sell
a product tomorrow will more than offset the cost today of the labour and
raw materials needed to produce it. If they are correct, they make big
profits; if they are wrong they face bankruptcy. Whatever happens, they must
remain alert because rivals are always scavenging for profits.
The Austrian concept of markets as dynamic processes is equally fundamental.
Mises had no patience with the traditional emphasis on 'equilibrium states'
which assumes that prices adjust swiftly to bring demand and supply into
perfect balance. In the real world, he pointed out, the conditions for
equilibrium were constantly changing; the mix of products towards which
business was striving today would be redundant tomorrow because of changes
in consumer tastes, business technology, government policy and a host of
other factors.
Equilibrium was thus like the crock of gold at the end of the rainbow. It
was something you might approach but could never attain. 'Perfect
competition' was not, as the textbooks implied, a characteristic of an
equilibrium state in which myriads of identical companies passively accepted
prices set by the market. It was, rather, a messy process in which,
typically, a few big companies battled for supremacy and enjoyed
considerable pricing power. It was a disequilibrium process that defied
mathematical analysis.
This may seem an abstruse point. Who cares if markets are in equilibrium or
not? But it turns out to be of crucial importance because the criteria by
which mainstream economists judge economic efficiency relate to equilibrium
situations. When Mr Clinton's advisers talk about 'market failure', they are
referring to the failure of real-world economies to achieve the efficiency
conditions implied by their imaginary equilibrium models.
Austrian analysis sweeps these concerns aside. Since real-world economies
are never in equilibrium, the efficiency conditions never apply. There is no
such thing as 'market failure' in the sense intended by Harvard-types
because the criteria for market success - the mathematical efficiency
conditions - apply only in non-existent situations.
Since Austrians do not believe you can prove free markets are efficient, why
are many deeply opposed to government intervention? Hayek provided the most
convincing answer. In the 1940s, he stressed a seemingly obvious but
hitherto ignored fact: the sum total of knowledge available in an economy
'never exists in concentrated or integrated form but solely as the dispersed
bits of incomplete and frequently contradictory knowledge which all the
separate individuals possess'.
What Hayek meant is that you and I (and the managers of private-sector
companies) know far more about our circumstances and desires than could ever
be acquired by a central authority. Even if governments could obtain and
process all the information dispersed throughout a market economy (an
impossible task), they would still not know enough to make the 'right'
decisions. This is because we often do not know in advance what knowledge
will be relevant to our decisions: we thus could not keep government
officials fully informed even if this were our goal.
Mainstream economists still talk grandly about 'maximising social welfare'.
Hayek's point about the dispersal of knowledge shows that this goal is
really nonsensical. Nobody could know enough to measure society's welfare,
let alone to maximise it.
Hayek's central point is not that market prices convey and summarise
already-existing knowledge - something most economists would accept. It is,
rather, that the incentives offered by market prices during the dynamic
process of competition lead to the discovery and dissemination of new
knowledge. As Kirzner stresses, they promote innovation and growth by
'alerting hitherto unwitting market participants to the possibility of pure
entrepreneurial profit . . .' Such discoveries, argues Kirzner, 'constitute
the crucial steps through which markets tend to achieve . . . successively
better co-ordinated states of society'.
Austrians believe decentralised markets will nearly always outperform
bureaucrats for two reasons. They provide access to far more of the relevant
information (in terms both of personal preferences and technological
options) and they provide strong incentives (in the shape of profit
opportunities) for using the information efficiently. Even if governments
can somehow discover what to do, officials typically lack appropriate
incentives: remuneration, for example, is rarely linked to the economic
performance of sectors they regulate or control.
The principal task of government should thus be to eliminate obstacles that
prevent markets operating smoothly. Since markets are in continual flux,
Austrians do not regard any particular market structure as ideal. In some
sectors peak efficiency may be achieved through competition between only a
handful of large enterprises; in others it may require hundreds or thousands
of competitors. The efficient number and size of companies, moreover, will
change over time.
The crucial requirement is that individuals and companies (foreign as well
as domestic) always be allowed to enter existing markets and compete away
the profits of established companies. With completely free entry, Austrians'
claim, entrepreneurial competition becomes an upward spiral leading to ever
higher standards of living.
Government regulation is no substitute for more intense competition because
it tends to stifle the innovation that leads to economic growth; indeed
Austrians such as Kirzner argue that the true cost of intervention, while
high, is impossible to calculate because nobody can predict what advances
would occur in its absence.
Austrian theories will appear realistic or naive depending upon one's
temperament and experience. But in forming a judgment, bear in mind that
Austrians have an excellent track record on the central economic debate of
this century. Mises published the first coherent critique of socialist
economics as early as 1920. During the 1930s, he and Hayek stood virtually
alone against the economics profession in arguing that central planning
could not work. The technocrats who saw economics as akin to engineering (a
science independent of politics) were still defending socialism in the
mid-1980s. They still run the profession but somewhere up there, Mises is
having the last laugh.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Italy heads for the unknown
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's general election on March 27 looks less like a poll in a member of
the Group of Seven industrial countries than an electoral contest in one of
the new democracies of central and eastern Europe.
The end of the cold war has broken the mould of Italian politics and removed
one of the buttresses that has sustained the Christian Democrats' continuous
hold on power since 1948. The corruption scandals of the past two years have
discredited the former political establishment.
Italy's fresh start is, of necessity, a journey into the unknown. In the
first election under an untried voting system, Italians are being asked to
choose from a collection of new or renamed political parties grouped in
uncertain alliances offering policies that are vague, opportunistic or both.
Three main groups are bidding for votes. On the right, Mr Silvio Berlusconi,
the media magnate, has linked his new Forza Italia movement with the
populist Northern League and the renamed neo-fascists in the south.
Attempting to hold the centre ground is the Popular Party, previously the
Christian Democrats, in a tenuous pact with Mr Mario Segni, the champion of
electoral reform. The linchpin of an alliance of eight left-wing parties
(including residual die-hard Marxists) is the former communist Party of the
Democratic Left (PDS), the main victor of last autumn's local elections.
Economic miracle
Left and centre have shown alarm at last week's opinion poll giving Mr
Berlusconi a clear lead. Mr Achille Occhetto, the PDS leader, is trying to
persuade the centre to join him in a 'stop Berlusconi' campaign. However,
since the PDS and the centre do not trust each other sufficiently to put up
joint candidates, the tactic may not be very effective.
Profiting from his hold over an important section of the Italian media, as
well as from his popular image as a self-made entrepreneur, Mr Berlusconi
has sprayed the electoral battlefield with promises of an economic miracle.
He has not, however, spelled out the evident reality that recovery will be
conditional on further painful cuts in the budget deficit. Additionally,
this Italianised Ross Perot has not resolved the contradiction of advocating
radical free market policies in partnership with southern allies who urge
continued generous subsidies to Italy's poorest regions.
Strong continuity
Mr Occhetto has the most detailed economic platform, pledging strong
continuity with the 10-month-old administration of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi,
the former governor of the Bank of Italy. If it gains power, however, the
PDS's chances of enacting this responsible-sounding programme will be
constrained by the need to maintain support from its far-left partners. Mr
Occhetto knows that his party's past is a source of uncertainty both for
right-wing voters and for the capital markets. The PDS leader spent last
Friday in London telling bankers that a PDS win should not be a signal to
sell the lira.
The new electoral system, combining a mix of majority and proportional
voting, has been designed to give Italy more stable coalitions and more
cohesive government. In fact, in view of the low probability that any one of
the competing alliances will gain an absolute majority, a clear-cut election
result is unlikely. If the PDS alliance emerges as the strongest grouping,
Mr Occhetto says he would favour Mr Ciampi staying on, either as prime
minister or as a super-minister for economics.
Evidently, a post-election period of political muddle may occur. This would
greatly complicate the next government's task of pressing ahead with
administrative reforms and wrestling with public debt of 114 per cent of GDP
at a time of low growth and, possibly, rising international interest rates.
Mr Ciampi certainly has the qualities to deal with these circumstances. From
other candidates, Italians must hope for greater clarity as the campaign
heats up.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Malta full prepared for admission
into European Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STEPHEN C CALLEYA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The FT survey on Malta (February 18) provides a very accurate synopsis
of Malta's proactive domestic and foreign policy agenda for the 1990s. I
would, however, like to raise two points of clarification with particular
reference to Robert Graham's assessment of Malta's EU application.
First, the Fenech Adami administration has consistently declared that Malta
is fully committed to subscribing to the EU's common and foreign security
policy (CFSP).
In fact, there is no need for any constitutional amendments prior to EU
accession because Malta's neutrality, which is based on the principles of
non-alignment, in no way contradicts what is stated in Title V of the
Maastricht treaty.
A specific section of the title stipulates that the introduction of a CFSP
does not mean that member states cannot continue making their own specific
security arrangement: 'The policy of the Union in accordance with this
Article (Article J4) shall not prejudice the specific character of the
security and defence policy of certain Member States.'
In addition, admission of the neutral European Free Trade Association
countries will establish the framework to accommodate the Maltes whose
neutrality is 'sui generis'.
Second, if the institutional implications of the four EFTA candidates do not
present a problem for the EU decision-making process, it is difficult to
comprehend how the case of Malta will. To suggest that EU institutional
reform should be a prerequisite to the vetting of Malta's application would
be setting a precedent and equivalent to re-writing EC history itself.
Moreover, the ministry of foreign affairs is already in the process of
building a professional diplomatic corps that will be adequately prepared to
assume the administrative and bureaucratic responsibilities that EU
membership will entail.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor (2): Swiss ban not so remarkable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL B. WEST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Thank God the Swiss people ignored their government's advice on the
trans-Alpine truck referendum. Freight belongs on the rails. Anyone who has
struggled up the third lane of the M1, and then driven on the relatively
truck-free Swiss roads knows this. It would be more appropriate if the EU
adapted to the Swiss. When the French eliminate their nasty peage, the
Germans understand the sanity of speed limits, and the Italians introduce
'road manners' into their dictionaries, maybe then they can talk about
unity. By putting the trucks on the rails, the Swiss are following the
example set by the whitest of white EuroElephants: the Chunnel.

Sir, It is not at all remarkable that the Swiss should vote to ban foreign
trucks ('EU up in arms over Alpine truck ban', February 22). If you sought
the opinion of the British on any aspect of UK transport policy, from
restricting traffic in towns to the government's Pounds 23bn road building
programme, you would encounter similar sentiments. What is remarkable is
that the Swiss government, which campaigned against the ban, actually paid
attention to what its people want.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: R&amp;D systematically undervalued in UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROGER LYONS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The question of reporting R&amp;D expenditure is not just an issue for
accounting standards ('Companies breach R&amp;D accounting standards', February
24). MSF, the largest union for scientists and technologists in the private
sector, believes the contribution of R&amp;D expenditure to the future wealth of
the UK is being systematically undervalued.
At present there is no requirement for companies to report properly defined
R&amp;D expenditure in their company accounts and reports.
According to a 1993 study by Company Reporting, of the 43 per cent of
companies that reported R&amp;D expenditure in their annual reports, 25 per cent
gave no further details in their accounts. Is it no wonder that this creates
an image among brokers that R&amp;D expenditure is not important? The government
and both sides of industry must promote the importance of R&amp;D expenditure.
MSF has long argued that this debate could properly be stimulated by
introducing legislation to make reporting of properly defined R&amp;D
expenditure compulsory.
However, we suspect that the government would oppose any such move as 'red
tape' and over-regulation of industry, even though this would send a message
to investors, customers and employees alike, about a company's commitment to
product development.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Labour costs not main problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAN CORRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Martin Wolf ('A relapse into Eurosclerosis', February 24) gives an
eloquent exposition of the free-market perspective on Europe's jobs problem,
but it is massively over-simplistic. While many of the points he makes are
important, to put the prime responsibility for high EU unemployment on
excessive labour costs gets us nowhere.
First, much of the jobs problem in Europe at present concerns the lack of
demand for unskilled, usually male workers. The US answer that Mr Wolf would
have us embrace involves pushing down the market wage and non-wage costs for
many workers. But will this ever really allow us to undercut competition in
the tradeable sector from the developing world? And do not the high
non-employment rates of unskilled males in the US also indicate that such a
policy simply leads to withdrawal from the official labour market?
Second, what of the countries supposedly putting the EU under such pressure
 -the east Asian tigers mentioned by those business leaders you surveyed?
Certainly they have used the power of the market in their climb to the top,
but this has not involved complete deregulation or pure free-market forces
but has balanced strategies to promote long-termism alongside the dynamism
of market forces. Competitiveness increasingly means working closely with
employees, encouraging continuing training and having flexible staffs - all
things that may be threatened by an over-reliance on a short-term,
hire-and-fire, insecure jobs market.
Third, there is considerable evidence in economic literature that there are
effective alternatives to the deregulated American model of capitalism. Why
give up on them just because the EU is at the bottom of a severe recession
(due to an excessive 'free market' belief in the power of low inflation to
generate growth) and because structural changes are needed?
As Professor Richard Freeman of Harvard University has commented of the US
jobs success story: 'To many Europeans the virtues may look overwhelming, in
terms of higher employment and reduced unemployment. To many Americans, the
costs are devastating in terms of poverty, inner-city slums, homelessness .
. . The US has not achieved nirvana - save for the highly skilled and the
very rich.'

FT  28 FEB 94 / Face to face with Ukraine's future: A look at the meeting
between Presidents Clinton and Kravchuk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND and JILL BARSHAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the eve of his long-awaited visit to Washington, President Leonid
Kravchuk of Ukraine has caused dismay in the Clinton administration by
announcing that he will not be a candidate in June's presidential elections.
For the US, this is a troubling development. Mr Kravchuk's skill at
convincing the Ukrainian parliament to surrender the country's nuclear
missiles transformed him, in the assessment of American diplomats, from 'an
ex-communist ideologue' to 'a remarkable statesman'. American officials in
Kiev are so worried by Mr Kravchuk's apparent decision to leave the
political stage that they are theorising his announcement is merely a tactic
designed to test his political strength.
But regardless of whether Mr Kravchuk is being coy or in earnest, President
Bill Clinton confronts a more basic challenge. With or without Mr Kravchuk
at Ukraine's helm, the US and more broadly the Group of Seven leading
industrial nations must formulate a coherent strategy for their relations
with the second most powerful former Soviet republic.
The west's initial attitude to Ukraine, now a country occupying a territory
the size of France, was to hope that it would remain part of the Soviet
Union. This sentiment was displayed most egregiously in August 1991, by
President George Bush, who lectured Ukrainian parliamentarians on the
virtues of remaining in the Soviet Union less than two weeks before they
decided to go it alone.
In spite of US efforts at persuasion, Ukraine chose the path of
independence, however tenuous it has proved to be. Even if, bereft of Mr
Kravchuk's statesmanship, Kiev follows through on its pledge to relinquish
its nuclear weapons, two further problems remain. In three years of
independence, the government has pushed the economy into free-fall, setting
records for hyperinflation in the post-communist world. The resulting
hardship has exacerbated regional tensions in the Russified east and
provoked secession in Crimea, which elected a pro-Russian president in
January.
Neither the nuclear nor the economic issue might be worthy of Mr Clinton's
attention were it not for Ukraine's geography. Positioned next to an
increasingly expansionist and unstable Russia - many of whose leaders regard
Ukraine as a natural part of 'greater Russia' - Ukraine has the potential to
become, in the view of some US intelligence experts and UK military
analysts, the site of Europe's bloodiest conflict since the second world
war. For the west, the question is whether to leave Ukraine to its fate or
to take on the job of bolstering the shaky Ukrainian state.
In Washington, the most vocal proponent of the latter view is Mr Zbigniew
Brzezinski, former National Security adviser in the Carter administration.
In a forthcoming article in America's leading foreign policy journal,
Foreign Affairs, Mr Brzezinski argues that the only way to ensure that
Russia becomes 'a normal state' is to create conditions in which it is
impossible for a neo-imperialist Russia to emerge. To do that, he says, the
west must put its money on Ukraine.
'It cannot be stressed strongly enough,' Mr Brzezinski writes, 'that without
Ukraine, Russia ceases to be an empire; but, with Ukraine suborned and then
subordinated, Russia becomes automatically an empire'. He urges the US to
promote, then help pay for, economic reforms in Ukraine and to offer public
support for the country's independence and political integrity.
But other American foreign policy observers, equally convinced that a
Ukrainian-Russian confrontation is both dangerous and likely, draw the
opposite conclusion. Mr Irving Kristol, a leading rightwing commentator,
recently argued that 'a Russian-Ukrainian conflict looms, one that Russia is
bound to win'. This view leads Mr Kristol to conclude that Ukraine's fate is
to become 'a client state, or semi-protectorate of Russia'. Mr Kristol
thinks this is Kiev's problem, not Washington's.
How Ukrainians resolve the dilemma of Russia's influence versus independence
will furnish the answer to which of these two views prevails. But with less
than a month to go before parliamentary elections and a presidential race
which, if Mr Kravchuk is serious, could be wide open, Ukraine is ambivalent
about its future.
One reason is that in order to settle its foreign relations it must first
set its own house in order. This means deciding who will lead the country.
On March 27 more than 5,000 candidates will be competing for 450 seats in
parliament, but the race, which a western observer in Kiev describes as 'a
free for all', is generating more heat than light. More than half of the
candidates are running as independents and, with about 30 competing
political parties, no single democratic, pro-market bloc has been formed.
The political debate is shaping up against a background of a deepening
economic crisis. With monthly inflation figures approaching 90 per cent and
a budget deficit last year which accounted for 29 per cent of gross domestic
product, the transition to the market has caused undoubted privation.
Yet serious though Ukraine's economic plight may be, it is not shaping up as
the main issue in this spring's election campaigns. In part this is because,
thanks to Ukraine's fertile agricultural land and the prevalance of an
informal barter system, the disintegration is more brutal on paper than in
real life.
But it is also because the great challenge of nation-building is the
dominant preoccupation of the politicians. Forging a country out of 53m
people, 11m of whom are ethnic Russians, is proving a Herculean task.
Eastern Ukrainians would rather live in a country which has a friendly
relationship with Slavic Russia, along the lines of Austria's links with
Germany, while nationalistic western Ukrainians would prefer to see their
nation solidly anchored in Europe.
As Mr Roman Szporluk, a professor at Harvard University, puts it: 'I see
quite a big debate, perhaps a political struggle, in which various regions
are trying to present their own models, but I think it's a debate about
whither Ukraine not whether Ukraine.'
The talk on street corners in Kiev, in Lviv in the west and in Donetsk in
the east suggests that Mr Szporluk is right. At a recent banquet for a
visiting Russian emigre businessman, Ukraine's Jewish prime minister, a
native of the eastern Donbass region, made a toast, in Russian, to
independent Ukraine. The government officials who flanked him, one from
Odessa in the south, one from central Ukraine, rose to join him and, as the
evening wore on, and the vodka bottles grew lighter, spoke in increasingly
hostile tones about the 'damned Muscovites'.
For all their economic ineptitude and internal struggles to forge an
identity, the politicians thus appear committed to maintaining Ukraine's
independence and unity. Whether Mr Clinton decides to welcome Mr Kravchuk on
Thursday with promises of aid or to leave him and his country to their own
economic devices, Ukrainian leaders have decided that it is better to rule
from an impoverished Kiev than to submit to orders from oil-rich Moscow.
In Washington, Mr Kravchuk will ask for financial aid to bolster the parlous
economy so that the country is at least able to withstand threats from
Russia to cut off Ukraine's energy supplies.
Mr Kravchuk will request a Dollars 300m 'bridge loan' from the US; he will
also ask Washington to support Kiev's application for a Dollars 700m loan
from the International Monetary Fund and a Dollars 400m World Bank loan for
sectoral reform.
If Mr Clinton decides that Kiev is not worth the investment, Ukrainian
politicians will continue the search for ways to consolidate their country's
independence. 'The economy is one thing, but the need to defend one's
country is a stronger impulse,' said Mr Dmytro Pavlychko, chairman of the
powerful parliamentary commission on foreign affairs. 'Let no one think that
Ukraine will peacefully give up and become a province of Russia.'

FT  28 FEB 94 / In the public eye: The head of the UK prison service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Derek Lewis, former chief executive of the leisure group Granada,
was appointed director-general of the prison service in England and Wales at
the start of 1993, he described the job as a 'proverbial bed of nails'.
After a career as a high-flying business executive, he was the surprise
choice to run more than 130 prisons, taking a significant pay cut to do so.
Lacking any previous experience of prisons, he was regarded with suspicion
in a service sceptical about the ability of outsiders to cope with its
uniquely difficult task.
Now, a year later, Mr Lewis admits there have been days when he wondered
whether he had made the right decision. But overall he has no regrets over
taking a job that he says has become 'totally absorbing'.
The biggest difference he has found in his new role is the intensity of the
public scrutiny to which he is exposed. It is, he says, greater than
anything he had experienced in the private sector.
It is hard for anyone from the private sector to prepare for the level of
exposure encountered in public life, he adds. 'Intellectually, one can
understand it, but you don't really know what it is like until you
experience it.
'In the public sector, we work in a goldfish bowl. I am answerable 24 hours
a day, seven days a week, on issues ranging from penal policy to the
treatment of individual prisoners.'
Mr Lewis did not have to wait long for his first experience of public
accountability. Just three months after taking up the post, a row erupted
over the privatisation of the escort service which ferries inmates between
prison and court. Group 4, the private security group, lost seven of its
charges during the first two weeks of the contract for escorting prisoners
in East Midlands, Humberside and Yorkshire.
The resulting furore drove home the message that everything the prison
service did was fair game for public comment. But Mr Lewis feels that his
private-sector experience made it easier for him to fend off calls for
private contracts to be abandoned.
'I don't think there has been a single launch of anything that has not had
significant teething problems,' he says. 'Having been involved in many
start-ups, I was able to take a slightly more relaxed view and be more open
about the things that had gone wrong.'
Those skills were again put to the test last August following damaging
criticism of Wolds remand prison, the UK's first privately-managed prison. A
report by Judge Stephen Tumim, the chief inspector of prisons, welcomed some
aspects of the Wolds regime but criticised the absence of constructive
activity for prisoners on remand. 'It was a balanced report,' says Mr Lewis.
'But it was the critical comments that attracted the headlines.'
That was followed by a hardy perennial in the prison service - the threat of
industrial action by the Prison Officers' Association. The traditionally
militant union, an effective opponent of change in the past, refused to
co-operate with privatised prison escorts.
Last autumn, the Home Office won an injunction against the union,
successfully arguing that prison officers had the status of constables and
so could not take industrial action. The removal of the right of officers to
strike is being confirmed by legislation currently passing through
parliament, a move which has done little to improve relations with the POA
at national level.
Mr Lewis prefers to see the flare-up with the POA as a watershed that will
lead to better industrial relations in the prison service. He sets great
store by the sort of communication between staff and managers that is at the
heart of modern human resource management techniques.
'We now have the opportunity to put our industrial relations on to the sort
of footing that exists in most other organisations in the public and private
sector,' he says.
Throughout these storms, the prison service has had to cope with a steeply
rising number of inmates, raising once again the spectre of prison
overcrowding. The climate of public opinion has also moved in favour of
harsher prison regimes, with Mr Michael Howard, home secretary since last
May, keen to demonstrate his toughness on criminals.
These two factors have made it harder to complete the improvement of
conditions recommended in the Woolf report after the Strangeways prison riot
in 1990. Yet Mr Lewis believes that he has been able to make significant
improvements in the service, ranging from the quality of catering to the
amount of time prisoners spend on work and training.
He derives the greatest satisfaction, however, from his programme of
management reform in the service. In line with private-sector orthodoxy,
much more responsibility is being devolved from headquarters to local
managers - the governors who run the prisons. This has revolutionised
governors' attitudes, claims Mr Lewis.
'The dependency culture is disappearing: governors no longer say they can't
do what they want to because they don't have the resources. Now they tell me
what they're going to do and how they're going to do it.'
He acknowledges that the introduction of private-sector competition has
helped generate this new enthusiasm. Three prisons have so far been
contracted out to private management, with more to come. But governors and
staff are taking a positive approach to competition, he adds.
'There is a much more confident note which says 'we can give the private
sector a good run for its money'. That is what competition from the private
sector was meant to do.'

FT  28 FEB 94 / Arts: Design fit for great scholars - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first library at St John's College, Cambridge was completed in 1628 and
is a glorious room, 100ft long with a panelled timber roof and a traceried
Gothic bay window overlooking the river. In old engravings you are lucky if
you can spot the occasional scholar reading - it was clearly a place for
almost solitary contemplation where the great works of the past seeped into
the brain by osmosis. Ancient libraries have a rare and impressive quality
of pure learning about them - like the Ark of the Covenant, they hold the
truth.
The presence of knowledge is almost palpable - which is the main reason why
the great Reading Room of the British Museum should continue to be used for
reading when the British Library has moved to its horrible new home in
Camden. Today we live in a world dominated by information rather than
thought. Every new computer opens up yet more ways of communicating,
linking, faxing, photocopying, printing and word processing. Every library
can be linked to every other library, every book and newspaper can be read
on a screen, and every bar-coded book can be traced all over the world. With
so much electronic data, what is the future of the college library?
Clearly the University of Cambridge believes that individual college
libraries will continue to have an important role. Several colleges have
built new ones or added to or upgraded old ones. Downing College, Clare and
now St John's are the most recent examples. Downing went along their chosen
route of encouraging the Classical revival by appointing Mr Quinlan Terry as
their architect. He has added two important buildings to William Wilkins's
19th-century neo-classical college buildings. Clare chose Arup Associates as
their architects and made a disastrous decision when it came to siting -
spoiling the central axis of a court with an intrusive block.
St John's went down a different route and invited a number of architects to
compete to produce a design and, after a lengthy process of attrition,
Edward Cullinan Architects were chosen. The new library is a very clever and
careful addition to the college's range of architecture, which has examples
of good design from almost every century since the foundation of the college
in 1511.
It took courage to place a building in the lowering shadow of Sir George
Gilbert Scott's immense chapel, a cross between Pershore Abbey and the
Sainte Chapelle. Another near neighbour of the new library is Sir Edward
Maufe's residential block, added to Chapel Court in 1939, in a style that
Edward Cullinan describes as 'horizontal gothic'.
Cullinan gutted the undistinguished, late-Victorian building by Penrose,
housing lecture halls with sets of rooms above, that stands in Chapel Court
next to the old library. He added a 'crossing' that runs through the centre
of the old building giving it a new heart and making it very much larger. To
demolish the rather dull 1880's building and to build anew would have been
cheaper but Cullinan's solution is more contextual and appropriate. Facing
the chapel the new block makes a porch and large gable - in the master's
garden it rises into a gloriously curved tall brick apse that is almost
Romanesque in its dignity.
The decision to add and adapt does not weaken the quality of the new
architecture. Michelangelo added to the Campidoglio in Rome and Brunelleschi
added on his brilliant Pazzi Chapel in Florence - so the precedents are
good. Cambridge is so full of architecture that it would be hard to imagine
many opportunities for more free-standing new buildings. The scale and
quality of the old helps to inform those qualities in the new architecture.
The large lecture halls of the old Penrose wing have been well adapted to
become the entrance and catalogue hall of the new library. You enter under
the giant porch - pushing hard at a huge centrally pivoted timber door. This
door is the only wilful and rather silly affectation about the new library.
Once through the narrow security point you are in a double-height hall with
a mezzanine gallery where students perch comfortably in curved carrels. The
library is full of ingeniously designed and comfortable corners to work in.
The seating up in the porch is highly favoured as a vantage point: it gives
you a perfect view of college comings and goings as you pretend to work.
The four floors of library - one has been successfully added in the roof -
are all close to computer facilities and there are provisions for high-speed
communications at every desk. The library is open 24 hours a day and has
proved extremely popular with students. It is the envy of other colleges. I
thought it was a brilliant piece of architecture - especially when seen from
the master's garden.
The curved apse of brick with stone banding that matches the old building is
powerful and convincing. The esprit of the pointed roof lantern that also
functions as a natural air conditioner is very enjoyable. Throughout the
interior Cullinan has done what he always does - provided places to enjoy
views, secret corners for assignations, and everywhere enjoyable chances to
make friends with the building. This is architecture for today that is
heart-warming.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Arts: Curtain up on a first class show of initiative - A
look at the plight of dance and theatre students in search of a grant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week I got the chance to adopt Martin Scott Gilmore. He seems a nice
lad from his photographs, even if he does spend most of his time covered in
make-up and pointing a toe.
Gilmore is a student at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, and like most
drama and dance students these days he does not get a grant from his local
authority. He gets by by persuading a group of patrons to pay his rent,
livings costs and fees, and wants more backers to see him through his final
year. In return for cash you get termly progress reports and a warm glow.
Friday afternoon another drama student, Richard Knight, who is at LAMDA, was
chairing a discussion at the Duke of York's Theatre involving Stephen Fry,
Derek Jacobi and Brian Blessed. Apart from the fascination of the
conversation, the ticket revenue from the event should enable Knight to
complete his course. In the second year at LAMDA only two of the 24 students
are on full grants.
These are just two examples of how drama and dance students must use their
initiative to keep going. Local authority grants are disappearing fast, and
most tyro actors and dancers are forced to get an evening job, or rely on
the generosity of their parents to see them through their courses. To rub
salt in the wound, they rarely qualify for student loans - either because
they are not taking degree courses, or because they can hardly guarantee
being employed, and thus able to repay the money, after completing their
studies.
The figures speak for themselves. In 1987, 83 per cent of the students at
the leading drama schools were receiving full awards from their local
authorities; in 1993 only 39 per cent were in this happy situation. Dance
students are in the same boat. By a twist of history, music students, thanks
to the influence of Ted Heath when prime minister, and art students,
considered to be potential contributors to the nation's craft and design
skills, can usually rely on grants from their councils.
The government's remorseless capping of local authority expenditure has
forced them to limit the size and number of grants, or stop them altogether.
Even cities basking in the glory of patrons of the arts, like Birmingham and
Manchester, have stopped making grants, along with inner London boroughs,
like Lambeth, Haringey and Brent, and counties like Worcestershire and
Warwickshire.
This puts terrible pressure on the drama and dance schools. They maintain
that they still offer places to auditioning students on merit, but they know
that, at the last minute, some will not receive a grant and will fail to
arrive for classes. It makes planning very difficult. The Drama Centre, for
example, with an intake of 30 last year, wanted nine students who failed to
make the course for financial reasons. And two more students dropped out
after starting lessons because of money problems.
It is not only the students that are frustrated. In many cases parents take
out a second mortgage or sell off grandmother's jewellery to finance the
course. Then unemployment, or some other calamity, strikes and the whole
family faces penury. Worries about paying the fees as well as the rent
inevitably takes its toll in the performance of students, who are often
exhausted after spending their evenings working in bars and restaurants.
The colleges do their best by building up scholarship funds, and looking to
board members and sponsors to make donations. They can often find money for
students from obviously under-privileged groups, like the ethnic minorities,
but there is never enough available. Successful actors and dancers are under
constant pressure to respond to appeals from students at the drama and dance
schools which nurtured them. If they help out one, they are inundated with
more requests.
Richard Ralph, of the London Contemporary Dance School spells out the
problems. 'Good students are not coming forward because they fear they will
not get a grant. Of last autumn's first year intake of 50, a half had
funding problems. For the first time ever more of our students are paying
for themselves than are getting a grant.' And over 40 per cent are from
abroad.
There are alternative courses in the new universities, like Middlesex, which
offer practical training as part of more academic courses in drama and
dance, but the hours spent on the bars, or in performance, are much fewer.
And some colleges like Rambert, which is linked to the West London
Institute, and the Royal Ballet School, have more secure financial supports.
But for many of the most famous schools, like Guildhall, and Central, and
Laban, the situation is deteriorating rapidly.
Peter Brooke, the National Heritage Secretary, is aware of the crisis. He
does not want the professions to become the preserve of the middle classes,
foreigners, or students who by chance live in a favoured part of the
country. He understands that without decent grants the next generation of
Kenneth Branaghs and Michael Clarks will not emerge, and the contribution of
the arts to the well-being of the nation will be weakened.
Last week discussions took place with the Education Secretary John Patten,
who has responsibility for student funding, and the inevitable report was
commissioned. There does at last seem to be the will to resolve the matter.
The problem is the Treasury.
It does not want to sanction a new central source of funding students with a
tendency to grow like Topsy. What will probably happen is that a list of
approved drama and dance schools will be drawn up, and students awarded
places by these institutions can be confident of grants. With annual fees
rarely topping Pounds 7,000 this should cost the government only Pounds 3m
or so a year. But with auditions well under way for the next academic year
action is needed swiftly to prevent another crop of talent withering to
dust.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Arts: Carter's new 'Partita' - Music in Chicago
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since Elliott Carter has now passed the age of 85, his current works will be
recalled as 'late Carter'. But the phrase feels all wrong.
His new Partita, earlier this month by the Chicago Symphony under Daniel
Barenboim, is as fizzy as anything he has composed: bright, mostly fast,
always fleet, and with an extraordinary subtlety of detail. Eight years ago
he produced a three-minute orchestral firework display entitled A
Celebration of Some 100 x 150 Notes. The new score, lasting six times as
long, must contain something close on a hundred thousand of the things,
disposed in artfully worked strokes: almost every chord is vitalised by
staggered entrances and exits of instruments; every line an internal energy
of swirling colour.
The title, according to the composer, refers not to the Baroque musical form
but to the standard meaning of the word as 'game': a kind of mental football
match, where the play is brisk and athletic, and the spectator has to be
alert to what is going on right across the field. Speed of change is not new
in Carter's music; what does seem to be coming through more strongly now is
a similar liveliness in music of slower pace. Soon after the start of
Partita, the stage is taken by a pair of flutes carefully exchanging notes,
but their duet soon becomes a glowing ensemble of flutes and violas all in
echo and half-echo (the sheer beauty of sound in this score needs to be
emphasised).
This same effect is achieved within a solo line, as when the English horn
keeps restarting a simple musical sentence. Continuity and interruption:
these keep the game moving forwards. As the composer has noted: 'My music
seeks the awareness of motion we have in flying or driving a car and not the
plodding of horses or the marching of soldiers that pervades the motion
patterns of older music.'
Nevertheless, a touch of 'older music' survives. There are signs in Partita
that the dances of old Bach have not been completely forgotten, and it is
not only the prominence of the piano in the scoring that keeps us in touch
with Stravinsky. Somewhere inside Carter there is still the voice of his
teacher Nadia Boulanger insisting on order and courtliness. The struggle
against constraint, the breaking of the mould, perhaps has to be re-achieved
in each new piece: this is the nature of the game. Partita abounds in
invitations to its performers, and a great many of them were thrillingly
taken up by the orchestra.

FT  28 FEB 94 / People: 'Classic HR requirements' at SCA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New Zealand is about as far away as you can get from Sweden, but it is to
New Zealander Larry Simpson that the big Swedish pulp and paper group SCA
has turned to make the highly unusual appointment of a foreigner to be group
human resources director, writes Hugh Carnegy.
Simpson, currently in charge of human resources in Europe and Africa for
DHL, will leave his present base in Brussels later next month for Stockholm
where, according to SCA information chief Sten Lindholm, he will be unique
as a non-native personnel director in a big Swedish corporation.
SCA counts one other foreigner - Briton Colin Williams - among the ranks of
its top nine executives. He heads SCA Packaging, but is based in Brussels.
Lindholm says SCA is looking to Simpson to bring a breadth of vision to the
management of human resources in the group, which has been undergoing
significant restructuring.
Simpson, 45, took his time saying yes to the job. He was first approached a
year ago. But he says he is 'very impressed' by the quality of his new
Swedish colleagues - and attracted by life in the somewhat staid but
beautiful city of Stockholm.
'Sixty five per cent of SCA's business is derived from outside Sweden so it
is logical for them to have a mix of people at the top - to have a broad
view and not just a Swedish view,' he says. He perceives some 'classic HR
requirements' at SCA, including the development of senior management,
recruitment, mobility of staff and pension and cost issues.
Simpson has worked for 13 years for DHL, first in New Zealand, then in
Singapore, before moving to Europe. He is looking forward to enjoying
Sweden's ample opportunities for skiing and sailing. But his first priority
is to learn Swedish - even if that is unlikely to be a real requirement in
Stockholm where even most taxi drivers seem fluent in English.

FT  28 FEB 94 / People: Jaffre takes tighter grip at Elf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The reshuffle of top posts at the head of Elf-Aquitaine, France's largest
industrial group, continues apace following the arrival of Philippe Jaffre
as chairman last August, writes John Ridding. Bruno Weymuller, president of
Elf Petroland, the oil group's Dutch subsidiary, is to replace Philippe
Hustache as chief financial officer. Hustache, who helped steer the group
through its privatisation, completed earlier this month, is leaving the
group to become president of the Dassault family's financial and property
arm.
Like many of Elf's top managers, Weymuller is a graduate of the prestigious
Ecole Nationale Superieure des Mines in Paris, a training ground for
engineers and industrialists. Weymuller, who is 45, also has a degree in
science from MIT.
The new finance director will not, however, take Hustache's place on the
company's senior management committee. This may suggest that Jaffre, former
chairman of Credit Agricole, France's largest bank, and a product of the
French financial administration, may himself be taking a tighter grip on the
group's financial affairs.
Since taking control of the oil group, Jaffre has given priority to raising
the returns on investments and winding down less profitable ventures. He is
currently seeking, for example, to reduce Elf's participation in a FFr15bn
project in eastern Germany to rebuild an ageing refinery.
As well as promoting Weymuller, Jaffre also looked inside the group for a
new administrative director. Philippe Jacques, currently head of the group's
Russian subsidiary, will take over the post from the beginning of April.

FT  28 FEB 94 / People: Minorco: Munera resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The resignation of Gerard Munera as chief executive and president of Minorco
(USA) 'in order to pursue other opportunities and spend more time with his
family' suggests to some analysts that perhaps he and Hank Slack, Minorco's
president, have different ideas about the group's future in North America,
writes Kenneth Gooding.
It would not be the first time for Munera. He gave up as chief executive of
Union Miniere in 1989 because he clashed with the then-president Herve de
Carmoy about the direction the Belgian metals group should take. Just over a
year later, after a brief spell with RTZ in London, he joined Minorco (USA)
which had been set up to oversee the Luxembourg-based group's interests in
the States.
Since then Minorco, the offshore investment arm of the Anglo American
Corporation of South Africa, has changed substantially. Slack emerged as the
sole managing director (previously three shared that responsibility) and
last September Minorco took control of Anglo's non-diamond interests outside
South Africa - mainly unquoted investments in South America. Anglo recently
has seemed to be more enthusiastic about South rather than North America.
Munera's role will be taken over by Reuben Richards (above), at 64 six years
older than Munera. Richards, previously a banker, joined the group in 1982
and was in charge in the gloomy days when Minorco's main subsidiary in the
States, Inspiration Resources, was doing so badly it was dubbed Desperation
Resources by some wags.
He remains chairman of Minorco (USA). Munera, originally a French-Algerian
but now a US citizen, is also leaving Minorco's main board.

FT  28 FEB 94 / The Monday Interview: Lord Lawson's own U-turn - The former
UK chancellor tells Peter Norman why his OECD candidacy has involved a
change of heart
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Four and a half years after resigning as UK chancellor of the exchequer,
Nigel Lawson is hankering to get back into public service.
Not content with a highly regarded volume of memoirs, a modest portfolio of
directorships and a seat in the House of Lords, he has set his sights on
becoming secretary general of the Paris-based Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development when the post falls vacant in September.
Lord Lawson's bid to head the 24-nation centre for economic analysis and
co-operation among the world's leading industrial countries is not without
chutzpah. In his memoirs, published only 18 months ago, he said the OECD had
'outlived its usefulness as an institution'. He dismissed its annual
ministerial meeting as a 'talking shop' and 'a waste of time and money' that
'even causes member countries to maintain a full-time ambassador (to the
organisation), ensconced in an expensive Paris residence'.
But ensconced in the comfortable surroundings of his own Northamptonshire
country home, Lord Lawson insists that he is just the man to move the OECD's
operations 'up a gear'. Speaking for the first time on his candidacy, he
says he could make it more useful to its member governments and more
beneficial to the world economy.
But what about those disparaging remarks in his memoirs? The view in his
book was based on his experiences as a minister in the 1980s and he points
out that he also singled out the organisation's economists for high praise.
He has changed his mind about its potential because of dramatic changes in
the world economy since then.
The collapse of communism in the former Soviet Union, the expansion of the
dynamic Asian economies, the world-wide consensus on the virtues of market
economics and the emergence of a global economy 'to a greater extent than at
any time since before the first world war' mean that there is 'a need and
opportunity to try and create a new world order'. This world order, which
would encompass countries inside and outside the OECD, 'would be based on
the essence of its mission, which is the promotion of economic development
through economic liberalisation.
'The liberalising mission is very much in accord with what has always been
my own view of the most effective way to secure economic development and
growth. Equally, the need or desirability of international co-operation is
something which I subscribed to as a minister and indeed practised,' he
says.
The organisation, he says, has an opportunity to play a bigger role in
fostering international economic co-operation and economic liberalisation.
But hasn't the OECD already embarked on this course under Jean-Claude Paye,
the quiet French diplomat who has been its secretary general since 1983?
Although Lord Lawson says that Paye 'has done a very competent job', he says
a secretary general is needed who would give more leadership at this
juncture of world economic developments. The organisation's message could
come across a lot more clearly. It would benefit from a rather higher
profile, a less bureaucratic leadership and improved relations with member
governments at a higher level. Moreover, Paye has held his post for 10 years
and that 'is enough for anybody'.
'The OECD is not just a think-tank. An important element is the relationship
between it and the member governments and the interplay between the two.
That is absolutely critical. Because of my experience in government I could
help that to work more effectively and have a closer relationship between it
and the G7 for instance.'
Involving governments in the organisation's work at a higher level would
ensure that its economic research output would be properly fed into
policy-making.
Lord Lawson says a radical change of direction is not needed. But he wants
to build on present strengths, in particular the expertise of its staff.
'Knowledge - as information, research, analysis - has become much more
important than it was before. That is a key resource, rather than money,' he
says. The fact that the OECD 'is not in the business of dispersing money is
a strength rather than a weakness because it is focusing on economic issues
and there are no distractions,' he contends.
He points out that ministers and officials are far busier than they used to
be and often caught up in crisis management. Its bureaucratic structure
means that 'there is a danger of muffling the message, of producing an end
product that is not commensurate with the amount of work that has gone into
it'.
Ministers need to be given work that is clearer, more concise and 'readily
assimilable and relevant to their pre-occupations'.
Although Lord Lawson speaks of making ministers' lives easier, he faces an
uphill struggle to win the requisite support of the member states.
There are three other contenders including Paye, the present incumbent. More
ominous for the former chancellor is that the US, the biggest member with a
25 per cent stake in the organisation, is giving its support to Donald
Johnston, a little-known Canadian.
A protracted and unedifying period of inter-governmental haggling and
horse-trading about the appointment is in prospect. Even though the
secretary general's job is well endowed with pay and perks, one wonders why,
at 61, Lord Lawson wants to decamp from his handsome new home to take up a
post that could keep him hard at work until he is over 70.
The urge to shape policy is in his blood, he says. The world economy is at a
very exciting stage and he wants to be part of it. 'I took a decision that
if I was going to play a part in this, I would want to play an active part.
I wouldn't simply want to write about it,' Lord Lawson says.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Management: Untangled web reaps its reward - Why Coats took
top prize for its published accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'You have to be comfortable in exposing yourself,' says Neville Bain, chief
executive of UK-based textiles group Coats Viyella, with just a touch of
smugness.
Only a few years ago, the idea of Coats reaching the shortlist for, let
alone winning, the annual Stock Exchange and Chartered Accountants award for
published accounts would have been unthinkable. The company was more
notorious for concealing information than revealing it.
So for New Zealand-born Bain, and finance director Russell Walls - both
appointed to their current positions in 1990 - the recent award is
especially sweet.
Bain's claim to have banished secrecy and opacity - barely a page in the
winning report is free of reference to disclosure - will not necessarily
convince the City sceptics.
Helen James, textiles analyst at James Capel, remarks: 'It's sycophantic in
the extreme. I'm not surprised they won after they put all that goody-goody
rubbish in it.' But she also gives credit where it is due. 'There used to be
about 200 reporting divisions so no one knew what was going on,' she says.
The Coats conversion to Cadbury principles of corporate governance,
environmental reporting and early adoption of the Accounting Standards
Boards changes on financial statements - some of the items that caught the
judges' eyes - has been a gradual process, even under the muscular new
management team.
The 1989 and 1990 reports, for example, were long on glossy photographs but
still short on disclosure. In 1991, things began to look brighter. Bain had
taken on a design consultancy, Merchant Corporate Design, and a slogan: 'The
Colourful World of Coats Viyella'. Divisional reporting was clearer - much
needed, given the spread over six business streams from fashion retail to
precision engineering - and the company's executive structure was better
explained.
The most important innovation was a comprehensive financial review, partly
to address speculation about the goodwill and fair value adjustments that
accompanied Coats' successful contested bid for Tootal that year.
The award-winning 1992 report built on these improvements and went a stage
further.
'Our brief from Neville Bain was to produce a structured document that
showed exactly how the divisions contributed to the whole, that showed the
company was keen on disclosure, and a new emphasis on the importance of
design and customer service,' says Catherine Samy, managing director of
Merchant.
Pages of advertisement-style photographs, accompanied by short texts, are
designed to highlight aspects of Coats' closeness to the customer. The
divisional reporting is crisper, and the financial review is clear and
detailed.
Richard Sykes QC and his panel appear to have been most impressed by Coats'
obvious desire to conform with accounting best practice. Sykes warmly
praised the 'full notes' on the introduction of the 1992 accounting standard
FRS3 and the early adoption of FRED3, both of which affect the presentation
of the results of UK companies.
'Coats Viyella's accounting change is to be applauded,' he said. Corporate
governance had been 'dealt with very well' - with a full statement on the
Cadbury report - as had the company's section on environmental policy.
As Coats plunges into the production of its 1993 report - the report team
does not write any 'filler' text before the figures are in - one question
remains. Did Coats win because it has gone in four short years from being
one of the most uninformative on the Stock Exchange to a model of disclosure
 -or because it was simply the best?
'The report is very, very detailed,' says James. 'They have improved their
presentation dramatically. But they are not particularly ahead of anybody
else.'
So one suspects that Coats' report is being rewarded for two things: most
improved performance on disclosure, and a gorgeous cover.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Management: Making more of research
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How does the UK get better value out of its burgeoning management research
industry? The country now has more than 100 business schools - roughly half
of whose 4,100 academics are thought to be active in research - yet it is
widely agreed that their quality and impact is variable.
Such a feeling prompted the Economic &amp; Social Research Council in late 1992
to look at the issues under the aegis of a commission chaired by Professor
George Bain of the London Business School.
Many of the recommendations of its final report* published this month are
concerned with sustaining and improving the quality of research. But there
is also strong emphasis on improving its relevance to users - managers,
entrepreneurs, policymakers, consultants and trade unions, for example -
notably in the proposal for an independent management research forum to
generate debate about priorities.
The forum as outlined could have other roles, including helping to increase
the exchange of knowledge between academic and user communities and helping
to develop research partnerships. Researchers are also urged to support
their proposals to the ESRC with 'user strategies'.
The report argues for increased public funding but says this should be
matched with co-funding from institutions and business. It states that 'good
management research develops from a synergy between the needs of practising
managers and the inquisitive, analytical, explanatory approach adopted by
academics. And the best management research lifts itself above immediate
problem-solving to provide perspectives that contribute towards a cumulative
understanding of management and the environments in which it operates'.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Management: Secret messages - Electronic mail presents many
challenges besides the technological ones
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sun Microsystems, the Toronto Stock Exchange and the Los Angeles Times have
little in common, except that they are among thousands of companies whose
employees have discovered how electronic mail is changing life in the
office.
Sun's chairman Scott McNealy broke new ground with his Christmas message
last December. McNealy's voice, as well as his picture, were transmitted by
E-Mail to 12,500 employees around the world. A few clicks on a computer
mouse brought his video message on to their workstation screens. At the
Toronto Stock Exchange, at least one manager last Christmas quietly informed
subordinates of their 1994 pay increases by E-Mail.
Journalists at the LA Times, meanwhile, have had a sobering reminder of the
perils of E-Mail. The paper late last year recalled a Moscow correspondent
who found a way to read colleagues' private electronic messages. The
offender was caught after he revealed juicy but fake bits of office gossip
which his editors had arranged to be sent into another reporter's E-Mail
basket.
Electronic mail is transforming the workplace by enabling workers at all
levels to communicate with unheard-of speed, frequency and in many cases
anonymity with their bosses, peers and subordinates.
Junior employees no longer need to barge past a phalanx of secretaries for a
word with their boss. Indeed, many chief executives who might formerly have
kept in touch with workers by wandering around offices and factories, now
encourage them to put their thoughts into a private E-Mail basket.
Thanks to E-Mail, a faraway hotel room equipped with a computer jack is as
close as the office next door. 'I can manage as well from Paris as from
here,' says Bill Raduchel, Sun's vice-president for corporate planning, in
Mountain View, California.
According to a survey by the Electronic Messaging Association (EMA), a trade
group based in Arlington, Virginia, the number of E-Mail sites at head
offices and branches of North America's 2,000 biggest companies exploded
from 94,000 in 1991 to 180,000 last year. The number of users is rising by
17-19 per cent a year. Thanks mainly to the proliferation of local area
networks, messages among workers in the same office have doubled over the
past two years.
A growing number of companies are also extending their E-Mail systems to
customers and suppliers. To reflect its broadening use, E-Mail is
increasingly known as electronic messaging, or electronic data interchange
(EDI).
At Hewlett-Packard's California head office, for example, workers use E-Mail
to pick up itineraries from the company's travel agent. Dana Corp, the
Ohio-based automotive parts maker, uses an electronic messaging system to
ensure that its own and its competitors' clutches are shipped at the right
time and in the right quantity to nearby Ford assembly plants.
By combining a purchasing order, confirmation letter and computerised
drawing, it has become possible 'to do electronically what a purchasing
manager used to do with a stapler on his desk,' says Kurt Anderson, E-Mail
marketing manager at Digital Equipment.
As this new means of communication permeates the corporate culture, however,
it is presenting as many management challenges as technological ones.
E-Mail's accessibility and anonymity have flattened corporate hierarchies.
But it has also swamped managers and workers with more information than most
either need or want.
'It represents an incredible cultural change,' says Mike Frow,
vice-president for US corporate banking at Bank of Montreal.
Frow is in charge of a pioneering project to create a central electronic
file for each of the bank's corporate customers. All files will contain data
which used to be scattered in dozens of computer systems and paper files
throughout North America.
'You are actually threatening people's sense of themselves because they no
longer have the control over the information they had before,' Frow says.
Some companies are lightening 'information overload' by drawing individuals'
attention to electronic documents only when they need to see them, and by
carefully routing mail through the corporate hierarchy.
Hiring a new employee at Hewlett-Packard, for instance, requires the
approval of several layers of management, and sometimes more than one
manager in each layer. The E-Mail system automatically sends the necessary
documents from one person to another only as each signals authorisation.
Similarly, many companies are putting less pressing items into electronic
'bulletin boards' which employees can tap into.
The accessibility and the profusion of information on E-Mail systems have
heightened security and privacy concerns. E-Mail has given corporate
snoopers and gossip-mongers a powerful new tool, increasing the temptation
for disaffected employees to vent their anger on colleagues' computer
screens. Raduchel says Sun Microsystems' executives will not respond to
E-Mail rumours, 'no matter how outlandish or accurate they are'. Many
companies now have a rule that anyone caught reading others' E-Mail risks
dismissal.
The EMA advises members to draw up explicit policies to protect employees'
privacy. In doing so, it suggests that companies consider their rules in
roughly analogous non-electronic situations, such as monitoring employees'
phone calls, requirements that supervisors receive copies of subordinates'
correspondence, and inspecting files kept in an employee's offices.
In spite of the huge advantages of electronic messaging, there is widespread
agreement that it is no substitute for face-to-face contact.
The pros and cons of E-Mail were underlined in a New Yorker article about
Bill Gates, founder of the Seattle-based software company Microsoft. The
author had had several E-Mail conversations with Gates and reported one of
his replies: 'E-Mail is not a good way to get mad at someone since you can't
interact. You can send friendly messages very easily since they are harder
to misinterpret.'
Bob Walker, director of information systems at Hewlett-Packard, adds that
'our dominant form of communication is still flying people to a single spot
and sitting down with one another'.

The US Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that an airline passenger bumped from

Northwest Airlines that a 1978 federal airline deregulation law prevents the

clears the way for a trial over a Dollars 60,000 claim arising from an

ticket was bumped from a flight and then offered Dollars 198 in compensation
or another flight scheduled to arrive six hours later than the original.

FT  28 FEB 94 / The Business Traveller: Close shave for women - A look at
the unsuitable toiletries some airlines provide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATE BEVAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a month flying around Australia in economy class, being upgraded to
business class for the Qantas flight home to London from Sydney was a treat.
I settled back in my big, comfortable seat and opened the airline's
complimentary bag of toiletries. Eyeshades and socks - both useful for a
long flight. A fine-tooth comb - not much good for my long hair, but I had
my own in my handbag. Also a toothbrush, toothpaste and earplugs - and a
razor, Gucci Nobile shaving cream and Gucci Nobile moisturiser for men.
Had there been a mistake? I was not the only woman in business class, yet
nothing in the bag was specifically for women. 'No, it wasn't a mistake,'
said Qantas. 'We are reviewing the contents of our kits, but at the moment
we don't do a separate kit for women.'
This may be the age of equal opportunities, but female travellers will find
it's still a man's world on many carriers.
United Airlines of the US said that, until recently, its business-class
passengers had received a bag containing Paco Rabanne aftershave, a razor
and shaving cream. However, it is now attempting to cater for women - or
less specifically for men.
From this month United is introducing what it calls a 'neutral' kit, which
includes an own-brand, unscented face cream, a lip salve, eyeshades, socks,
a toothbrush and toothpaste, with items such as razor and shaving cream on
request.
Air New Zealand is also going down the unisex route. 'We used to do
bum-bags,' said the airline, conceding that the contents were geared towards
men. Its new kit aims to include products suitable for both sexes.
Passengers now get a bag that includes a wooden toothbrush and razor,
un-bleached calico eyeshades, cotton socks and rehydration gel.
One reason carriers give for not providing kits for female passengers is
that few women travel business class. One large airline estimates that, even
on routes with the highest number of female travellers, they comprise no
more than 20 per cent of business-class passengers. That number drops
significantly on some routes.
Some say that in the present economic climate it is simply too expensive to
design complimentary products for women, hence the recent move by some to
more neutral kits.
But others do cater for women. British Airways introduced separate kits two
years ago: both include aromatherapy sprays and gels to combat dehydration,
but men also receive a razor and shaving cream. The move, it said, was in
response to a sharp rise in female business passengers - 25 per cent of its
business-class travellers are now women.
Cathay Pacific, based in Hong Kong, provides cleanser and lip balm for women
in place of a razor and Boss shaving cream.
Other airlines claim, however, that the logistics of loading separate kits
for men and women make the exercise too difficult.
Women travelling first class do get separate kits - this is easier for
airlines to organise because of the smaller numbers involved. But in
business class, it seems most women will still have to put up with razors
and shaving cream.

FT  28 FEB 94 / The Business Traveller: How to tackle the touts - What can
you expect when you step off the aircraft in Latin America? Stephen Fidler
guides you to the hotel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Latin America opens up its markets and enjoys an investment boom, more
and more foreign business travellers are heading south. They are discovering
that the spirit of commerce is thriving in airports all over the region:
local 'entrepreneurs' offer to carry suitcases, ferry them to their hotels,
or provide other services.
Particularly for the traveller who does not speak the local language, it can
be a stressful experience. It can be even more disorientating in the
northern winter, when the heavily clad voyager exits into the tropical heat
of the southern summer.
The good news is that, in most of the region, immigration and customs
facilities have much improved in recent years. Land crossings may be
different, but the airports in most Latin American capitals are not too
difficult to cope with. In most places, you can forget about the caricature
of a soldier picking through your belongings and awaiting a bribe.
Most countries now have red or green customs channels. Others operate a
system of random customs checks: travellers press a button, which shows
green, for go, or red, at which point you are directed to a desk to answer a
few questions and have your luggage looked at.
There are exceptions, but most customs officers do not appear to be too
worried about visiting foreign business people. There can still be awkward
moments, in both passport and customs areas. Some business people say you
are less likely to be bothered by customs if you go to Venezuela on a
tourist rather than a business visa, for example. Having several computers
with you might attract the attention of customs officers in Brazil.
But it is outside the customs hall that the main action starts. Of all the
most common business destinations in Latin America, the airport where you
are most likely to be hassled is Caracas. It is usually hot and sticky,
overcrowded and full of locals eager to help with your luggage.
In addition, the system of booking an official taxi at most Latin American
airports - where you buy a ticket at a booth - seems not to work in Caracas.
The booth is there, right next to the bureau de change on the way out, but
it usually proves impossible to communicate - in any language - with the
people behind the counter. They nod their head or point their lips - this
latter gesture is a Venezuelan peculiarity - in the direction of the touts
you have been fending off for the last five minutes.
When you get outside, you will probably find a 1970s American gas-guzzling
car - petrol is still only 5 US cents a litre in Venezuela - to transport
you to the hotel. It is best to fix a price beforehand, if you can.
Venezuelans pay about Dollars 18; visitors should pay no more than Dollars
25. Drivers may try to charge multiples of that to business people
travelling in twos or threes. Don't let them. Be ready, if you arrive during
the day, to put up with the miserable traffic jams.
If your reception at Caracas airport seems overenthusiastic, it tends to be
the opposite in Bogota, where visitors sometimes have to roam the airport
looking for a taxi. Once I succumbed to the entreaties of the owners of an
unmarked vintage Lada, of whom I was deeply suspicious but who turned out to
be charming and drove me to the hotel for a pittance.
Taxi drivers in the Colombian capital are all said to carry guns, so I have
resolved not to argue with them too vigorously. This can be tough: on one
occasion, my cab drove into the side of another taxi at a crossroads and,
when I got out, the driver demanded the fare - even though I was still a
long way from my destination. I paid.
Lima worries some travellers - one US immigration official in Miami (in
Miami, mark you) once told me I was going to the 'most dangerous place in
the world'. Now the threat of terrorism has receded (not disappeared), the
Peruvian capital's airport, though in a perpetual state of reconstruction,
is not too much of a hassle. If a taxi is not available, many hotels run
buses to and from the airport.
Santiago, now overcrowded but soon to open a brand new terminal building,
Buenos Aires and Montevideo offer few perils to most travellers. In Mexico
City and both of Brazil's main entry points, Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro,
it is a good idea to seek out the taxi booths. In Mexico City one is located
just outside the terminal building, while in Brazil the booths of competing
taxi companies are indoors. The taxis are clean and safe, the drivers know
roughly where they are going, and you can usually pay in local or US
currency.
Latin America is not like Switzerland: not even in Costa Rica and Uruguay,
the self-styled 'Switzerlands' of Central and South America. The best way
for the visitor to reduce airport stress is not to fight the local ambience
but to enjoy it.
While airport entrepreneurs certainly want your money, most prefer to obtain
it legally.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Can Europe Compete?: A crossroad of frustrations - Case
Study: unemployment on the German-Polish border
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As pedestrians cross the iron bridge spanning the Oder between Germany and
Poland, a one-legged Polish man brandishes a placard requesting D-Marks to
help him purchase a prosthesis.
Since German unification, the river has become a border not just between
hard and soft currency areas, but between compartments of the European
labour market. Poles and Germans are each having to adjust to the employment
crisis. They are doing so in different ways.
Before 1989-90, 600 Polish women were bused across every day for shift work
in the big semiconductor plant in Frankfurt an der Oder on the western side.
Previously an East German electronic showpiece, the plant once employed
7,100. Since the post-unity industrial downturn, the number has fallen to
400. And the buses have stopped coming.
Officially, unemployment in the Frankfurt region is 16.3 per cent, although
the true figure - taking account of temporary government work and training
schemes - is more than 20 per cent. With employment scarce, a panoply of
rules now keeps Polish workers away from east German jobs.
'The Poles are willing to work for much less money,' says Mrs Eva Novicka,
proprietress of a travel agency in Slubice on the eastern side of the river.
'No German will work for less than DM10 per hour. They are too proud. Poles
will accept jobs for DM7 to DM8.' High east German wages, leading to east
German unit labour costs that are 80 per cent above west German levels, have
lengthened local dole queues. None the less, the D-Mark attracts Poles
across the bridge to seek work in the most unpropitious conditions.
The current earnings gap is huge. This means Poles who carry out illegal
casual jobs at less than half normal German wages still earn much more than
they would in Poland. In the Slubice region, wages can be as low as DM150 to
DM200 a month, says Mr Wilfried Grieger, an official at the Frankfurt
employment office. This compares with DM1,500 to DM2,500 in Germany.
Mr Grieger says the system of work permits for Polish workers rules out
undercutting of official German wages. Also, Poles may work in Germany only
if they fill vacancies for which no German or EU citizens apply. But it is
an open secret that, on east German building sites, contractors pay casual
Polish labourers as little as DM2 an hour, against a German rate of DM15.
Officially, only 373 Polish workers now make the daily cross-border journey
in the Frankfurt area. 'Since there is a black market, the real figure could
be a lot higher. It is impossible to say how high,' says Mr Grieger.
Frankfurt has long been a crossroad of trade routes. But now, it is more a
crossroad of frustrated hopes.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Shrinkage in the textile industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European clothing and textile sector still employs nearly 3m people in
high-cost Europe, testimony to the fact that wage costs are not decisive in
determining competitiveness, writes David Goodhart.
True, some employment has been protected by the Multi Fibre Arrangement
quota system - and the phasing out of the agreement under the GATT agreement
will accentuate job shedding.
Estimates of the employment level by the year 2000 range from 1.5m to
700,000, with most jobs lost in low-wage countries, such as Portugal.
But many companies will keep some employment in Europe by developing
production systems to fit retailers' needs or moving up-market.
One is the German-based Steilmann Gruppe, which employs about 5,200 people
in Europe, 60 per cent of them production workers. That figure will fall as
more work is exported to eastern Europe, but Mr Klaus Steilmann, the owner,
believes employment in Germany will hold up as more people are hired for
management and related functions.
The company now indirectly employs about 25,000 people in the far east and
eastern Europe. That is partly because of laxer environmental regulations
and lower labour costs: women in Ukraine working for Steilmann partners earn
less than one sixtieth of the pay of women working in German plants.
Mr Steilmann's big competitiveness headache is currency instability. He
believes Europe will retain strong advantages at the fashion and 'high-tech'
end of the market.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Labouring under a tangle of rules -
Problems in Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Phillips produces a 92-page booklet from a drawer in his desk and
says: 'I have never seen anything as complex as this before.'
The abstruse publication, which sets out the in-house wages and working
conditions agreement at Finanzauto, leading domestic supplier of earthmoving
equipment, helps explain why Spain has a competitiveness problem and the
most daunting official unemployment levels in Europe.
According to Barcelona businessman Mr Carlos Ferrer Salat, president of
UNICE, the European employers' confederation, 'Europe has the most regulated
labour market in the world, and Spain's is the most regulated in Europe.'
The latest labour survey puts Spain's jobless total at 3.7m, 24 per cent of
the working population.
A South African-born manager, Mr Phillips was posted to Spain 18 months ago
to run Finanzauto, following its acquisition by J Bibby &amp; Sons, the UK
industrial group controlled by Barlow Rand of South Africa. He is still
baffled by the 60 job classifications, each with its own pay scale, that are
listed in the booklet to cover the company's non-supervisory labour force of
1,350.
To Mr Phillips's irritation, the in-house agreement establishes a basic
8am-3pm working day and a 37.5-hour week. The working day 'locks us out of
sync with our customers' and the working week is 'a darn sight too short'.
Finanzauto's employees are also protected by labour laws weighted towards
job security.
Mr Phillips says it cost Bibby 'a very large sum indeed' last year to
negotiate redundancies, mostly through early retirement, that brought
Finanzauto's labour force down from an inflated 1,950 to 1,493.
The company paid out an average of nearly Pta8m (Dollars 57,000) per
laid-off employee, a severance sum representing 45 days' pay per year
worked, as stipulated by Spanish law.
Finanzauto posted losses of Dollars 41m when it closed its financial year in
September, dragging down the results of both Bibby and Barlow Rand.
Faced with a construction industry slump, Mr Phillips's best hope of turning
the company round lies in rendering wholly obsolete the offending booklet.
In common with other Spanish chief executives, Mr Phillips argues the high
cost of firing is a deterrent to hiring and Spain's rigid labour laws have
played a significant part in the rise in unemployment.
Fortunately, Spain's government is now backing his fight. A bill before
parliament seeks substantial reforms to rules enshrined in company
agreements such as Finanzauto's. It promotes functional and geographical
mobility and cheaper firing procedures. Despite hostility from unions,
parliament is expected to approve the law by the summer.
Existing labour legislation is a hybrid drawing on the Franco period, when
trade unions were banned but workers were guaranteed a job for life and on
subsequent social democrat policies which boosted union power and further
regulated employment. Had the new labour bill been law last year, Bibby
could have cut Finanzauto's labour force at a fraction of the cost - 20 days
per year worked and a maximum severance package equal to a year's salary.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Convergence in the workforce - Labour
unity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Talk of a single market for labour in the European Union may seem premature
in light of the differences between regulations and costs in the 12 member
states. But Europe's individual labour markets are coming to resemble one
another more closely - and in the next 10 to 15 years this convergence is
likely to accelerate. The result may even be an improvement in
competitiveness rather than the deterioration of which some observers have
warned.
Viewed from the outside, Europe's labour markets already have much in
common, especially in terms of regulatory framework. But within Europe there
is also great variety. Average hourly pay in Portugal is Dollars 4.69,
compared with Dollars 25.34 in Germany. It is easy and cheap to fire people
in Britain, but it remains expensive and complex to do so - at least in the
formal sector of the economy - in Spain, Italy, France and Germany. Only 5
per cent of the Italian workforce works part-time, compared with more than
30 per cent in the Netherlands. Non-wage labour costs range from 3 per cent
of wage costs in Denmark to over 45 per cent in France.
A closer look at these divergences suggests, however, that they are seldom
at the root of comparative advantage. For example, differences in wages tend
to be matched by differences in productivity, leaving unit labour costs at
similar levels all over Europe. Differences in non-wage labour costs may
also be less important than they seem, as low non-wage labour costs will
usually be compensated by higher direct wage costs, and vice versa.
Companies are interested in the whole package of labour costs, flexibility
and skill levels. When all these factors are taken into account, pluses and
minuses often cancel each other out in Europe. Britain has a deregulated
labour market but a patchy record in education and training.
Germany is expensive and highly regulated but has highly motivated and
skilled workers. Some of the southern European economies, such as Portugal,
have low unit labour costs but also tend to be highly regulated.
For these reasons, 'social dumping' - the feared transfer of capital from
countries with high standards of labour protection to those where labour is
least protected - has not materialised in Europe.
But economic integration means that developments in one European labour
market are now influencing others. The threat of locating new plants abroad
has recently persuaded German workers at Bosch and Daimler-Benz to make
concessions. And Britain - with its opt-out from parts of the EU's 'social
dimension' - may continue to attract a disproportionate amount of inward
investment.
The result is a gradual trend towards greater flexibility across Europe,
whereby continental countries are adopting some aspects of British-style
deregulation without abandoning European social partnership. For example:
Obstacles to part-time and temporary work have been relaxed in Spain and
Italy, and the German government is now pushing for a big increase in
part-time work.
Minimum pay rules are generally still in place but they have in some
countries been allowed to fall in value. One partial example is France's
salaire minimum de croissance (Smic): the government is now allowing
companies to pay young workers less than the Smic rate, provided they spend
most of the money thus saved on training.
Union power has been on the retreat everywhere, with the possible exception
of Germany, although even there power is shifting from sectoral collective
bargaining to agreements at plant level. IG Chemie, the chemical union,
recently agreed to lower pay rates for new workers taken off the dole queue.
On labour costs, the gap between the poorer and richer economies is
narrowing markedly. According to Professor Douglas McWilliams, at the UK's
Centre for Economics and Business Research, the degree of divergence in
European wages will fall from 46 per cent in 1974 to 24 per cent by the end
of this decade, with upward pressure in the poorer countries as productivity
rises and downward pressure in the high-cost countries.
One sign of convergence is that economic migrants from Italy, Spain, Greece
and Portugal, who previously flocked to the richer northern European
countries, have lately been returning home, where better remunerated
opportunities now beckon as their economies begin to catch up.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Can Europe Compete?: The high price of social cohesion -
Could lower wages for the unskilled speed job creation in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's labour market stands accused. The high cost and low flexibility of
European workers have, it is alleged, seriously impaired the competitiveness
of European business.
The charge sheet boils down to two propositions: imports from low-wage
developing countries are undercutting the products of high-wage European
manufacturers of medium and low-tech goods; while inflexibility and failures
in training and education systems are leaving European countries
ill-equipped to keep abreast of America and Japan in future high-tech
products.
The consequences, the argument goes, have been slow employment growth and
rising wage inequality, alongside high and persistent unemployment. The
underlying fear is European companies will be able to compete in
increasingly competitive world markets only by shedding more and more
labour, compounding unemployment, or by forcing down European wages and thus
living standards.
There is some truth in these charges. But some of these trends affect the
labour markets of all advanced economies. Barriers to global trade, for
example, are continuing to fall for everyone as the technologically
sophisticated workforce of the world grows rapidly. There are now no more
than 600m literate workers in the world able to operate complex
manufacturing equipment, but in the next 20 years the figure could rise to
more than 3bn. World adult literacy, says the United Nations, has increased
from 15 per cent in 1953 to more than 60 per cent.
The effects of this trend, however, can be exaggerated. So far at least,
developing country trade is too small to have significant negative effects
on wages and employment in developed countries - the formers' exports
account for only 3.1 per cent of total manufacturing consumption in
developed countries. Only 5 per cent of EU industrial workers are employed
in sectors which export more than 40 per cent of their output, and only 7
per cent of European GDP is accounted for by imports.
Trade penetration will undoubtedly grow. But, for all advanced economies,
more important in undermining the employment of the unskilled is the shift
towards more sophisticated technology, leading to the employment in
manufacturing of fewer, better educated workers.
What matters for the competitiveness of European business and living
standards is the speed and ease with which wage-setting behaviour and worker
flexibility allow European companies to adjust to changing technology and
international competition.
Europe's recent record does not inspire confidence in its capacity to
change. Over the past 20 years Europe has had higher unemployment and lower
private sector job creation than the US and Japan and a poorer record at
adapting to external shocks, such as the oil price rises.
Labour costs are, on average, higher than in most other parts of the world,
though average hourly wage costs are now below Japan (in USDollars terms).
Moreover, European wage costs increased by 4 per cent per year in the 1980s
against no increase in America and very little in Japan.
But the picture is not overwhelmingly gloomy. European labour productivity
(output per person-hour) has been rising at 2 per cent a year since 1979 in
the economy as a whole. This is slower than Japan's but way ahead of the US
where employment creation in the service sector has held productivity growth
to  1/2 per cent. In manufacturing, Europe has at least kept pace with the
US.
Also, in the sophisticated goods that dominate world trade, labour costs can
be small. In the UK computer industry, for example, wage costs are only 15
per cent of production costs. And the recent trend has been towards wage
restraint in Europe. In Italy the scala mobile, which linked wages to
prices, has ended and even Germany is trimming fringe benefits.
Companies, especially those in high value-added sectors, often say labour
costs are not high on the list of factors affecting European
competitiveness. A private report on jobs and competitiveness by a group of
mainly US multinationals for the European Commission says companies
manufacture in Europe to be close to markets. Job cuts, it adds, are coming
from technical advances and organisational change, not primarily because of
low-cost competition.
Companies opening plants in Asia are doing so for the same reason US
multinationals want to be in Europe - to be close to markets. US computer
giant IBM even says the move into eastern Europe and Asia will create
managerial and logistical jobs in western Europe, at least short-term.
What the companies do complain about in Europe is lack of flexibility.
Limitations on working time, restrictions on using temporary and part-time
workers, and inflexible redundancy laws are the main complaints There has
been a general drift towards deregulation in European labour markets over
the past 10 years, but Britain is still far ahead in terms of ease of firing
and lack of regulation on wage setting, employee consultation and working
time.
Now the low-wage southern European economies, such as Spain, are trying to
loosen up. Some have inherited highly protected product markets which have
allowed a jobs-for-life culture, reinforced by the lack of a proper
state-funded unemployment benefit system. In Spain nearly 40 per cent of the
working population are on temporary contracts because of the difficulty of
firing people on standard contracts.
Few Europeans want to emulate the US, where about two-thirds of workers are
subject to instant dismissal. And there is evidence that short job tenure
reduces the likelihood of decent training, while job insecurity reduces
workers' commitment. So a balance is needed between flexibility and secure
employment, at least for high-skill, high-wage workers.
From an employment and a competitiveness point of view the pool of skilled
workers must become as large as possible.
These 'core' workers need sound basic education and the opportunity to
invest and re-invest in relevant workplace skills, if only so as to be able
to take them elsewhere.
Most European countries' record on basic education and training is superior
to the US, and there has been a sharp increase in the numbers staying on at
school in Spain, Italy, France and Britain. But European basic education
compares far less well with Japan, South Korea and Malaysia. And only about
30 per cent of young Europeans go into higher education, against nearly 70
per cent of young Americans.
The problem is that the core will never embrace all workers, and for those
outside that core Europe has provided fewer jobs than the US and Japan. In
those countries there are more jobs of the sort that anyone can do. This is
because their wages are lower and because the wage floor determined by
minimum wages and welfare benefits - about 40 per cent of average incomes in
most European countries - is less generous.
Real wages in Europe have risen in the past decade even for the bottom
decile, while in the US they have fallen sharply for the poorest workers.
That is one reason why between 1970 and 1992, when the US and EC economies
grew by similar percentages, US employment rose 45 per cent and EC
employment only 7 per cent.
Europe thus faces a dilemma: the fall in the real wages of the unskilled,
which the US experience suggests is needed to speed employment creation,
would mean wider income inequality than most governments will tolerate in a
continent claiming to value social cohesion as well as competitiveness.
The challenge is to find ways of supporting low wage households which speed
job creation rather than compound the poverty and unemployment traps which
already exist in many European countries.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Green rules threaten to lift waste disposal cost by 50%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The waste industry will today tell the government that new environmental
regulation could push up the cost of waste disposal by nearly 50 per cent.
Complying with the 1990 Environmental Protection Act will cost between three
and four times as much as the government has estimated, the industry says.
'The environment department is talking in terms of extra costs of about
Pounds 1 a tonne but we think it will be closer to Pounds 3 or Pounds 4 a
tonne,' said one leading waste company. UK landfills typically charge
between Pounds 6 a tonne and Pounds 16 a tonne for taking municipal waste.
Today is the deadline for waste companies to respond to the government's
plans for tighter control of landfills - licensed rubbish dumps. The rules,
which the industry expects to come into force on May 1, will say that
licence holders must be judged 'fit and proper'. It will also make them
liable for any future pollution from the site.
A separate, tighter European Union directive on landfills being discussed in
Brussels, could push costs up to almost double their present level,
companies say.
Industry estimates suggest that in Germany, where licensing rules are
strict, landfill costs range from Pounds 49 a tonne to Pounds 60 a tonne. In
the Netherlands, where pollution of groundwater is a concern, costs range
from Pounds 18 to Pounds 300.
Mr Miguel Pestana of Waste Management International, the environmental
services group, said: 'Once the new provisions take effect landfill prices
should rise.' But he added: 'In the last year pricing has been falling in
parts of the country because of competition - lots of players saw the
recession bite and volumes fall.'
The industry proposals, submitted through the National Association of Waste
Disposal Contractors, will call on the government to drop plans for a
landfill levy, arguing that the new regulation will prompt sharp price
rises.
The government wants the proposed levy to encourage more recycling and
incineration of waste.
Mr Steve Webb, policy director of the association, said: 'They have been
tackling this the wrong way round - they should encourage people to recycle
but not discourage them from doing something else, such as landfill.'

The fall in commercial property rents which started in August 1990 has
halted, according to the All Property Index published by Hillier Parker, the
chartered surveyors.
Shop rents rose 0.1 per cent over the quarter. Although rents in London have
continued to fall, rents are starting to rise in the north.
Offices rents have remained static outside London and the south-east. In
London's West End, rents rose for the second consecutive quarter, while in
the City they remained flat.
In the industrial sector, London and the south-east rents continued to fall.
Elsewhere there were no changes.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Managers see pay increase sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Managerial pay awards rose markedly in the three months to the end of
January, the first upturn in the level of managerial salary increases since
the summer of 1990, Richard Donkin writes.
The March issue of Incomes Data Services' Management Pay Review, which
analysed salary awards in 183 groups of managerial and professional staff,
says median awards rose from 2.5 per cent in the three months to October
1993 to 3 per cent in the latest period.
IDS interprets the rise as an indication of 'broad stability' rather than
recovery. It also says that pay increases are becoming more complex since a
growing number of companies are adopting Inland Revenue approved tax-free
profit-related pay schemes.
Pay figures released by the Engineering Employers' Federation today show
that settlements remain around 2 per cent. The average level of settlement
in member companies from November to January was 2.16 per cent.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Tunnel's friends dig in 100 feet down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eurotunnel may be late, over budget and widely scorned. But it knows how to
throw a party.
On Saturday it invited 800 people to lunch 100ft below the seabed and 7km
out from the British side. For the occasion a cavernous crossover point of
the tracks became a giant banqueting hall with 100 tables and twinkling
tricolour lights, video screens and a string quartet.
The event, inspired by Brunel's 1827 dinner in his recently completed Thames
Tunnel, was Eurotunnel's way of saying 'thank you' to all the friends who
helped it through the agonies of its eight-year life.
The British guests, who had to be brought in by British Rail because Le
Shuttle is not ready, arrived 90 minutes late but were delighted to find
that they had beaten the French.
Lady Thatcher, the guest of honour and, according to her hosts, the 'main
inspiration' for the project, proclaimed the triumph of private finance.
'Without it, this would never have happened,' she said. 'The paper we signed
to make this possible was worth a lot more than all the other bits of paper
we signed in the second half of this century.' Mr Jacques Delors was not
among those present.
The timing of this grandiose event, with its proclamations of amitie, was
not the best, coming as it did at the end of a week which had seen the
publication of 'Chanteclair's' anti-British diatribe and a further move by
the Paris government to prevent the anglicisation of French.
Eurotunnel's friends evidently do not include members of the British
government, whose dithering over the rail link added to its difficulties.
The most prominent active politician present was Mr John Prescott, shadow
transport secretary. But the Bank of England, the big clearing banks,
merchant banks and stockbrokers were there.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Prison Service management faces shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE and JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prison governors are being asked to prepare local development plans for the
future of their establishments under radical proposals to devolve management
in Britain's Prison Service.
One of the consequences of the proposed shift to devolved management will be
cuts in the 1,900 staff at the Prison Service's London headquarters. A
review of headquarters functions is due to be completed by April.
Governors and their management teams at 14 prisons have begun preparing
detailed strategic development plans - ranging from recommendations for
physical im-provements to buildings to changes in specialist services
provided for prisoners - under a pilot project to test the devolution
scheme. The approach will be extended to all state prisons by the end of
this year.
Mr Derek Lewis, who left the private sector to become director-general of
the Prison Service last year, said there was widespread recognition that the
service had been managed in a far too 'centrally prescriptive' way. 'The
structure does not allow governors to take sufficient decisions locally or
encourage governors to feel responsible for the destinies of their own
prisons,' he said.
Local development plans will give senior Prison Service managers a far
stronger basis for assessing the management performance of individual
prisons than exists at present, and a mechanism for allocating capital funds
depending on the quality of local proposals. Prisons taking part in the
pilot exercise are Dartmoor, Leicester, Shrewsbury, Bristol, Norwich,
Maidstone, Grendon, Wandsworth, Pentonville, Stoke Heath, Aylesbury,
Wayland, Linholme and Ford.
The Prison Service's headquarters has been divided into two functional units
 -staff responsible for the service's central strategic management, and
those providing services to prisons. All activities are being examined by
the review now in progress, which Mr Lewis said would 'undoubtedly lead to a
cut in the number of staff in headquarters, consequent principally on the
devolution to governors'.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Tighter insider net catches traders out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you were planning a bit of insider dealing in the gilts market, you had
better be quick.
The new insider dealing regulations, which come into force tomorrow, bring
government debt, Eurobonds and derivatives into the net for the first time.
They also broaden the definition of inside information, leading some lawyers
to say that the equity analyst's job could be changed fundamentally.
Yet the new rules are poorly understood in the City. An unscientific survey
by the Financial Times suggests that few staff outside City firms'
compliance departments have a good grasp of their implications. Some
compliance officers appear none too sure.
The extent of the confusion is shown in the table. Leading analysts, fund
managers and gilts traders were presented with a number of hypothetical
situations and asked whether they thought they were legal or illegal under
the old and new rules. Three representative sets of answers are shown. Even
the experts disagreed, and the 'right' answers in the first two columns
represent a rough consensus between the Treasury, the Stock Exchange, City
compliance departments and independent lawyers.
The Treasury and the Stock Exchange insist that this confusion has been
created by 'scaremongering' City lawyers. One official stressed that the new
regulations were introduced merely to implement a European Union directive
on insider dealing. The government was not trying to outlaw normal City
practices or even to improve the poor record of successful prosecutions for
insider dealing.
But some lawyers believe the new law does have important implications,
particularly for equity analysts. One City lawyer said: 'The new regulations
seem to put out of bounds a whole mass of unpublished industry information.'
This is because it is no longer necessary to show that 'inside information'
came from the company whose securities were traded. The information need not
relate directly to the security at all.
Consider the first example in the table. If your friend in the Treasury tips
you off about an interest rate cut and you buy gilts, it will be insider
dealing.
The information must still have an unambiguous implication for the
security's price. A leak of unexpectedly good trade figures, for example,
would not count as inside information for dealing in gilts or shares. But if
a source in the Russian government tipped you off about a huge new gold
discovery in Siberia you would be guilty of insider dealing if you sold gold
mining shares - though not gold - in the well-founded expectation that the
price would fall when the news broke.
In our table the gilts trader got this wrong because he thought the
information had to be 'confidential' in some sense. 'It is not as if the
Russian government is under an obligation to announce it on Topic,' he
objected.
The fund manager answered it correctly but then struggled with the questions
about retailer X. The first example, where the finance director leaks
details of the company's Christmas sales to an analyst, is exactly what the
authorities are trying to stamp out. But this 'nudge and wink' from the
company has been illegal since 1980.
It is the next example that is affected by the new rules. Here, the insider
dealer buys shares in X after its quoted rival Y says that its own Christmas
sales have been good. Legal under the old provision, this will be outlawed
from tomorrow.
What really baffled the fund manager was the next answer. If the information
comes from private rival Z rather than publicly-quoted competitor Y it would
not be insider dealing to buy shares in X.
He said: 'That's completely bizarre. I don't see why it should be different
just because it's a private company. And surely it should be the same as the
tip-off about the Russian gold mine.'
But disagreement over the final example, the so-called 'star analyst'
problem, is changing the way City firms operate.
The Treasury and the Stock Exchange insist that prior knowledge of a
price-sensitive stock recommendation from a star analyst is not inside
information as long as the recommendation itself is not based on unpublished
information. But some lawyers disagree. They believe that the new
legislation would outlaw the practice of 'front-running' - where a firm's
market-makers buy or sell stock ahead of its analyst's recommendation going
public. Though illegal in the US, this is common practice in the City.
In a memo to staff on the new regulations a leading securities house says:
'The position regarding market-makers changing their book as a result of an
as yet unpublished analysts's recommendation is still unclear and should be
avoided.'

FT  28 FEB 94 / Public access to Bar urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A barristers' think-tank set up to find ways of ensuring the survival of an
independent Bar in the face of increased competition from solicitors for
advocacy work has recommended that the public should have direct access to
barristers, Robert Rice writes.
At present only solicitors, a limited number of professional clients, such
as accountants, and overseas clients have direct access to the Bar.
A consultation document issued by the Bar's policy unit, chaired by Mr James
Munby QC, says existing restrictions should be abolished. These prevent lay
clients from consulting barristers directly for legal advice unconnected
with a court case.
Clients should also be able to approach a barrister directly in connection
with a court action, but barristers should be under a duty to refer them to
a solicitor as soon as practicable.
The reason for not recommending that the public should be able to instruct
barristers directly in court actions is said to be to allow barristers 'to
continue to concentrate on specialist consultancy and advocacy leaving the
bulk of the work of preparing a case for trial to the solicitor'.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Construction workers could lose tax right
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As many as 500,000 self-employed construction workers who are paid without
deduction of tax and National Insurance could lose this right under
proposals announced by Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary.
The Inland Revenue says that eight out of 10 construction workers could have
tax and National Insurance contributions taken directly from their pay
packets by the end of the century.
As many as two-thirds of workers on building sites are now self-employed.
Mr Dorrell, in a written answer to Parliament, says that the government
intends to make changes to the tax system in next year's finance bill.
The arrangements would not come into effect until the new system for
self-assessment for tax, announced in last November's Budget, is introduced,
probably in 1998.
Deductions would be based on an average effective tax for self-employed
building workers.
This would be lower than basic rate and would take into account the fact
that self-employed workers normally would be able to offset some of their
liability against business expenses.
On the basis of current deductions the construction industry believes that
the effective tax and National Insurance rate for self-employed building
workers would be about 18 per cent.
The current tax exemption scheme, which was introduced in 1971 and revised
in 1975, allows sub-contractors who qualify for '714 certificates' to
receive payment without prior deduction of tax and National Insurance.
The main qualification has been that individuals genuinely are self-employed
and that they should have a bona fide tax record covering three continuous
years.
Workers who are paid gross settle their tax at the end of the year. Policing
 -through a system of vouchers issued by employers - involves the Revenue in
costly paperwork which would be substantially reduced.
In a consultation document published in 1991, the Revenue was highly
critical of the present system, which it suggested was being heavily abused,
with even one-man labouring operations qualifying for 714 certificates.
Under the new system, businesses would have to have a minimum annual
turnover in order to qualify for their 714 certificates.
The consultation paper suggested the turnover figure might be Pounds 25,000,
which would exclude the vast majority of workers who now hold the
certificates.
However, most workers will remain classed as self-employed, even if they
have tax deducted directly from their pay packets.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Defiant double act shows a softer side: A look at Sinn
Fein's mood at its conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE and MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The overtly uncompromising stance to emerge at Sinn Fein's party conference,
held in a cramped community centre outside Dublin at the weekend, will not
be an immediate source of encouragement to the British and Irish
governments. Any lingering hopes that the political wing of the IRA would
hail the Downing Street declaration as the key to ending violence in
Northern Ireland were quickly dashed.
Sinn Fein, as expected, decided neither to reject nor to approve the
declaration and instead insisted that the UK government reopen direct talks
to 'clarify' what it considers the key issues of self-determination and the
'unionist veto'.
In a defiant double-act, Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, and Mr
Martin McGuinness, a member of the party's national executive, made an
elaborate display of unity following suggestions that the leadership was
divided on the way ahead. Mr McGuinness won one of the weekend's biggest
ovations when he insisted from the platform: 'There is not the slightest
possibility of a split.'
Both men repeatedly attacked the British government for breaking off its
secret talks with Sinn Fein and dismissed threats of a security crackdown if
the party rejected the joint declaration. Mr McGuinness, to cheers and
applause from a packed hall of delegates, said: 'What are they going to do?
Are they going to murder us? We've had that. Are they going to intern us?
We've had that . . . we are not afraid of it.'
Mr Adams described the UK government's attitude as 'despicable, devious and
damnable . . . marked by diversions, lies and petty manoeuvrings'.
So much for republican barnstorming. But behind this hard-line rhetoric
seemingly designed to reassure the party hardliners that Ireland's
reunification remains the goal, there are clear signs that Sinn Fein and the
IRA are willing to explore further the Downing Street declaration and to
keep the momentum of the peace process going.
The central concern of Sinn Fein is the 'unionist veto', by which it means
the joint declaration's guarantee to uphold the wish of the majority in
Northern Ireland to any constitutional change. Sinn Fein's demand for direct
talks with the British government is to clarify whether unionists would be
allowed to refuse to reach any agreement at round-table talks, following an
IRA ceasefire, and that any political progress towards new constitutional
arrangements would then stagnate.
Mr Adams, highlighting this concern in his speech, said: 'Is it unreasonable
to ask the British government what process, timeframe and framework it
proposes for reaching such agreement? Is it unreasonable to ask in advance
what would be its reaction if any section of the people who inhabit our
island refused to seek such agreement?'
Mr McGuinness says Sinn Fein has been assured by Dublin that the British
government appears happy with the Irish government's view that the unionists
would not have a veto over reaching an agreement. If this could be cleared
up in direct talks with the British government, he says, the impasse could
be broken and an IRA ceasefire could follow.
He is encouraged by recent speeches made by British ministers which he said
showed the UK government was 'grappling with new realities'. He added: 'On
the one hand they show a hard and stern face, and on the other there are
clear signs that many of them are troubled by Britain's role in Ireland.'
Sinn Fein's own 'hard and stern face' is similarly showing signs of
softening. Mr McGuinness said: 'We must also grapple with new realities. We
need to talk to the British government about this and how we can do that.'
In a frank admission, Mr Adams acknowledged that Sinn Fein was 'the weaker
party in the conflict' and that to move forward it needed to work together
with the Irish government and other nationalist parties 'even though we are
rivals'. As all these insist on an end to the IRA violence, implicit in Mr
Adams' statement is a possible growing realisation that the nationalist goal
may now be better served through purely political means rather than military
ones.
Strengthening the nationalist cause, he said, 'means local republican
activists being able to represent and speak for our communities in
conditions of peace, uninterfered with by the British military or the RUC,
free of personal harassment and free from the threat of the death squads'.
At the end of the conference Mr Joe Cahill, a republican veteran, said that
Sinn Fein's rallying cry of 'Our day will come' was now obsolete. Now it was
'Our day is here'. But the reality is that Sinn Fein, buoyed up by its
recent centre-stage performance, is threatened with a return to the shadows
unless it is prepared to take further risks. A weekend opinion poll showed
that, in spite of huge efforts to win publicity for its cause, public
support remains minimal.
As Mr Adams admitted, the next step in Northern Ireland is far from certain.
In words even British ministers might support he suggested the situation was
of such potential political fluidity that 'not us, the British or Dublin
governments can accurately predict the outcome'.

FT  28 FEB 94 / McGuinness demands pledge on veto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The IRA would suspend its campaign of violence if the British government
made clear that unionists did not hold a veto over the political progress in
Northern Ireland, Mr Martin McGuinness, a member of Sinn Fein's national
executive, said yesterday.
Mr McGuinness, identified by sources in Whitehall as IRA chief of staff,
told the Financial Times that events were possibly 'close to a dramatic
breakthrough' which could enable early talks involving the government and
Sinn Fein to take place.
However last night, in a further setback for the peace process, Mr Ken
Maginnis, deputy leader of the Ulster Unionists, said his party would not
take part in talks on the same basis as in the last round-table table talks,
which broke up in 1992. 'We will not let ourselves be tied down to the
three-strands process where nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.'
This did not imply the party would not enter a talks process but 'at present
there is nothing on offer in strands two and three' he said, referring to
the talks involving Dublin.
The party will today publish proposals for devolved government in Northern
Ireland in a move likely to increase tensions surrounding attempts to find a
political settlement.
Today's document is expected to dismay nationalists by arguing that a
blueprint for devolved government in Ulster is needed before progress can be
made on cross-border co-operation.
At the end of Sinn Fein's annual conference in Dublin Mr McGuinness said it
was 'crucially important' that Britain confronted uncertainties surrounding
the question of Irish self-determination. He pointed out that Mr Albert
Reynolds, Irish prime minister, had repeatedly said the unionists did not
have a veto on political progress. In private communications with Sinn Fein,
Mr Reynolds had also pointed out that Downing Street had never contradicted
him.
Mr McGuinness added: 'The implication of what Reynolds is saying to us is
that if they have not contradicted him they must agree with him. If they
agree with him, tell us about it and we are in business. We are moving.'
Asked if a ceasefire would then be possible he said: 'A dramatic statement
from the British government on the issue of the veto will deserve a dramatic
response from the IRA. And that means a suspension of IRA operations.'
Mr McGuinness said all sides would have to make concessions to break what Mr
Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, described as the present 'stalemate' in
the search for peace. Mr Adams said on Saturday that the government would
have to withdraw political support from the unionists.
But London is pledged, with Dublin, to press on with the peace process and
insists that before Sinn Fein is admitted to talks the IRA must renounce
violence.
Today's Ulster Unionist document is expected to underline the gulf
separating participants in the political talks by arguing that north-south
relations should be maintained by ad hoc meetings between Irish ministers
and representatives of a devolved Ulster assembly, rather than by separate
institutions.
The document is expected to argue that most legislative power should remain
at Westminster, at least until any new assembly has found its feet.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Science research panels unveiled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr William Waldegrave, science minister, is today expected to announce
details of 15 panels of advisers to decide UK research priorities.
Each panel will have 15 to 20 members and will cover a particular market
sector in commerce or industry. The 15 sectors include services, such as
finance, as well as high-tech industries such as information technology and
electronics.
Instead of the original plan to base the programme on about 10 'generic
technologies' such as biotechnology or sensors, there will be a more
wide-ranging approach giving as much emphasis to 'market pull' as to
'technology push'.
Appointments expected include Dr Alan Calder, research and development
manager of Zeneca Specialities, as head of the chemicals panel, and Prof
John Hillman, Scottish Crop Research Institute director, as head of the
agriculture, natural resources and environment panel.
The panels, to be announced at the launch of the Technology Foresight
programme, will consult this year before forming views on the market and
technological developments of the next 10 to 20 years.
The programme's steering group, chaired by Prof William Stewart, government
chief scientist, will then produce national priorities.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Bank probes manufacturing investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England is studying the intentions of about 250 of Britain's
biggest manufacturers to find out if lower inflation is causing more
companies to change their investment strategies.
The unpublicised survey reflects concern among some Bank and Treasury
officials that companies' investment intentions may not have altered to take
account of the possibility of lower price pressures over the next few years.
The survey was welcomed by the Confederation of British Industry which in
the past year has warned that companies may not be stepping up investment
quickly enough to help a full recovery from the recession.
Since manufacturing investment hit a peak in 1990 it has fallen by nearly a
quarter, with only a modest rise expected this year compared with last year.
Information from the questionnaire about the investment strategies of
companies will be fed into the routine reports sent by the Bank to the
Treasury.
One company chairman who has taken part said he was 'slightly cynical' about
the exercise. He added: 'It seems that the Bank is using this as a way to
point out to industry that it should be pushing ahead with investment faster
than is happening.' His company had already reduced the rate of return it
expected from investment projects from 20 per cent to 17.5 per cent.
The chief executive of another company said the survey was a 'welcome sign'
that the Bank was taking more of an interest in manufacturing. His company
had reduced its expected rate of return from 30 per cent to 22 per cent.
The Bank said the questionnaire was part of its normal intelligence
gathering operations. 'It fits in with our efforts to feel the pulse of what
is going on,' it said.

FT  28 FEB 94 / The Personal Pensions Time Bomb: Hard sell increases the
costly potential of 'a duff product' - Norma Cohen traces the development of
ideas aimed at reducing the burden of financing retirement which have
drained Pounds 10.5bn from the National Insurance fund in seven years
</HEADLINE>

It was during a weekend gathering of ministers and civil servants at
Chevening, the chancellor of the exchequer's country residence, in July 1992
that the government was first warned of the financial difficulties it had
created by promoting personal pensions.
On the opening day of a strategy session called by Mr Peter Lilley, the
social security secretary, a group of ministers and civil servants was
alerted to the potential cost of persuading people to opt out of
occupational and state pension schemes into personal pension plans.
The warning came from Mr David Clark, then deputy secretary for pensions, in
a paper to the assembled group of senior civil servants and ministers. A
minister recalled: 'The paper said that, in some sense, personal pensions
have been a tremendous success but there are a few time bombs ticking away
there.' The time bombs had been set ticking just eight years earlier when,
as a former official put it, the government became 'mesmerised' by the
allure of personal pensions as a way to extend choice, increase individual
investment and reduce the cost of the state pension scheme.
Yet even at the outset the government was warned of the potential pitfalls.
Throughout the preparation of the legislation pensions specialists and
senior civil servants highlighted the risks to the government's finances and
to ill-informed consumers who might be encouraged to opt out of occupational
schemes that would serve them better.
The full consequences of the government's enthusiasm are only now becoming
clear. That weekend there were revelations for Mr Lilley. He was told that
about 60 per cent of the nearly 5m people who had taken out personal
pensions since 1987 were saving no more towards their retirement than the
tax rebate the government offered them. And for vast numbers of these people
the sum amounted to only several hundred pounds a year.
The Pounds 6.9bn in tax rebates paid out between 1987 and 1992 had induced
very little of the activity that the government was so keen to encourage -
long-term savings by individuals for their own retirement.
The minister was also warned that hopes of cutting the costs of the state
earnings-related pension scheme (Serps) were unlikely to bear fruit because
people had the option of contracting back into the scheme when the rebate
was no longer to their advantage.
Large numbers of personal pensions were being sold to people who were either
too old or earned too little to benefit from them. A number of these would
be worse off in retirement than if they had not taken a personal pension.
Top officials at the DSS had nagging worries about personal pensions for
nearly a year before the July meeting when the first demographic data about
personal pension-holders was available to the department.
The officials said they were becoming particularly concerned about the
possibility that there was a direct connection between reports of widespread
mis-selling by life insurance sales agents and the fact that personal
pensions were being sold to those who could not benefit from them.
Yet when personal pensions were launched there was no public hint that they
would create financial difficulties on the scale now feared.
Indeed, the government launched the policy with an advertising campaign that
showed people shackled by their occupational pensions who would be set free
by personal pensions.
The government's interest in personal pensions came initially from two
sources: consumers and ideologues.
Mr Marshall Field, partner at consulting actuaries Bacon and Woodrow and
former general manager of Phoenix Assurance who was closely involved in the
development of the plans, recalled the roots of personal pensions in the
early 1980s: 'There was a great deal of fuss from consumerists and the press
about the poor treatment of early leavers from occupational schemes.'
The other push came from the Centre for Policy Studies, the rightwing
think-tank. It published a paper in 1982 written by Lord Vinson and the late
Mr Phillip Chappell that called for individual ownership of pension assets.
That message, former DSS officials said, gripped Sir Norman Fowler, then
social security secretary and now Conservative party chairman. Individual
ownership of pensions and the promotion of choice and flexibility in pension
provision seemed a logical extension of individual ownership of homes and
shares, which were already articles of faith for the Tories.
Yet even at this stage there were warnings from seasoned servers in the
pensions industry, including those who helped to write the legislation.
A former civil servant said: 'The reality is that this was a duff product
from day one.'
Former officials say ministers who pushed the legislation through were told
from the outset that personal pensions were likely to be bad for taxpayers
and a bad bargain for all but a limited group of potential customers.
Sir Norman pressed ahead by setting up a committee, including government
ministers and Mr Field, to consider changes to social security legislation.
He also set up a personal pensions sub-group, which included the highly
influential Sir Mark Weinberg, now chairman of J. Rothschild Assurance and
creator of two of Britain's largest life companies, Allied Dunbar and Abbey
Life.
One of Sir Norman's former aides said: 'In the main, Weinberg was the only
person in the industry who Fowler had direct contact with.' That group
produced a report in July 1984 which reflected both the concern that people
who left occupational schemes early were penalised with lower benefits and
the desire to promote individual choice. It also in part addressed concerns
about the potential for customers to be exploited by the way personal
pensions could be sold.
In particular, the National Association of Pension Funds had warned the
group that strict regulation of sales practices and control of fees and
charges would be needed to protect the consumers.
But by late 1984 government ministers had another reason to press ahead.
They were growing alarmed about projections that showed the cost of Serps
could soar by the year 2030. Mr Field said: 'It was at that point that they
got the idea you could blend these two themes together.'
Personal pensions seemed to offer a way to cut the costs of Serps by using
tax incentives to encourage people to opt out of the state scheme. The idea
was taken up in a government green paper on social security issued in June
1985.
Meanwhile, the Government Actuaries Department was asked to work up
projections about how many people would be likely to contract out of Serps
through a personal pension.
Although it outlined the effect on Serps if up to 5m contracted out,
privately GAD officials said it was never imagined that more than 500,000
would choose a personal pension. That was either because most people were in
a good occupational scheme or because the millions in poorly paid or
part-time jobs who were ineligible for an occupational pension would not be
able to take out a personal pension. Most significantly, the GAD made a
vital assumption about the impact of personal pensions on the government's
finances.
It had assumed that rebates of National Insurance contributions, which were
to be used to help fund personal pensions, would be what was actuarially
needed to provide a pension of equivalent value to a Serps pension on
retirement.
But, according to former officials, Sir Norman was determined to see large
numbers of people contract out of Serps.
That drive to cut the costs of Serps was reflected in a white paper
published in December 1985. What a portion of the industry liked in the
white paper was its proposal for offering rebates of National Insurance
contribution that, for young people, were far larger than what was needed to
provide them with the equivalent of a Serps pension by the time they reached
state retirement age.
The DSS was prepared to add a 2-percentage-point rebate of NI contributions
to those contracting out of Serps for the first time, so that for young
people earning enough to pay NI contributions a personal pension could be
very lucrative.
The other side of the coin, however, was that they were a bad deal for men
over the age of about 45 and women over the age of about 40, because the NI
rebate was buying less pension benefit than they would receive in Serps.
By April 1992 there were about 296,000 men over the age of 45 who were
contracted via personal pensions and 206,000 women over the age of 40.
Uniformly, former ministers and many in the life insurance industry refer to
the additional 2 per cent of NI rebate as a bribe to persuade people to opt
out of Serps.
Once the policy found its way into the Social Security Act of 1986 people
were allowed to contract back into Serps when they were too old to enjoy the
advantages of contracting out.
The results of this policy were set out in a study by the National Audit
Office in December 1990. It found that the rebates earned on personal
pensions between 1988 and 1993 would cost Pounds 5.9bn more than they would
save in terms of lower entitlements to state pensions.
A former official said: 'We all told the secretary of state that personal
pensions were really only good for the very young or for very high earners.
The head of the contributions agency in Newcastle (which remits NI rebates
to personal pension accounts) told me that on the last day of eligibility
for retrospective tax benefits three lorries full of applications turned up
at her door.'
Personal pensions, enshrined in the Social Security Act of 1986, became
available in July 1988. Self-regulating bodies began to notice mis-selling
was going on in 1990.
In March of that year Lautro, the self-regulating body for the life
insurance industry, issued an enforcement bulletin saying it was concerned
about misleading advertising urging people to contract out of Serps.
It reminded companies that only certain people could benefit - a significant
fact missing from the advertising - and warned them to modify their
advertising accordingly.
By the end of June 1991 Lautro was well aware that sales agents were urging
occupational scheme members to transfer into personal pensions. At this
stage, there were about 4.3m personal pension holders. In a report of its
monitoring committee, released in January 1992, Lautro noted that in the 12
months to the preceding June it had received many complaints about transfers
and had found evidence of mis-selling.
It was about this time that DSS officials started to worry that personal
pensions were being taken out by people who would have been better off
staying in an occupational scheme.
In June 1992, the month before Mr Lilley gathered his team at Chevening,
Lautro and Fimbra, the self-regulating body for independent financial
advisers, warned members that under almost no circumstances should they urge
an employed member of an occupational scheme to take a personal pension.
Although the personal pensions legislation gave the DSS the power to set
fees and charges, it has never written regulations to do so. Its one rule
has been that insurers may take no more than 5 per ent a year of the NI
rebate in sales agents' commissions, less than that paid on individual
monthly contributions to personal pensions.
The effect of the contracting out from Serps soon began to tell on the
National Insurance fund. By the end of the 1988-89 tax year - the first year
in which they were available - about 1.057m pensions had been sold, twice
the GAD projection. By the end of the following tax year they totalled
3.85m, rising to 4.305m at the end of the 1991 tax year.
Ministers watched as the massive rebates quickly eroded a Pounds 1.58bn
surplus in the NI fund. In the seven tax years ending April 1994, more than
Pounds 10.5bn has been paid out of the fund on behalf of individuals who
have contracted out of Serps through an approved personal pension.
Because of this drain on the fund, which is the pool into which workers'
National Insurance contributions are paid, several items historically funded
by the fund were slipped into the general revenue budget, where they remain.
Ministers did not advertise the outpouring of funds but a National Audit
Office report in December 1990 did.
The NAO found that because people could opt back into Serps when it was no
longer to their advantage to stay out, the Pounds 9bn in outgoings from 1988
to 1993 were only going to cut Serps' costs by Pounds 3.1bn.
The tragedy of the personal pensions saga is that at the outset there was a
clear need for government action.
Occupational pensions disadvantaged those who changed jobs and many who
wanted one had no access to it. Moreover, Serps would become unaffordable as
Britain's population aged.
But the net effect of personal pensions policies as a way to meet those
goals has been that taxpayers have spent billions to provide pensions to
some who may well be worse off in retirement than they would have been.

Brian Belk is fed up. Having switched into a personal pension six years ago
from his occupational scheme, Mr Belk said: 'It seemed a good idea at the
time. But I would have been better off staying where I was.'
He is one of  1/2 m or more people who have moved out of occupational
pensions into personal schemes since legislation to allow this was
introduced in 1988.
The 42-year-old former mineworker was sold his pension by Mr Wayne Rose, a
sales representative at Britannic Assurance's office in Doncaster, South
Yorkshire.
Mr Belk said he had been considering opting out of his British Coal
occupational scheme because he thought he might get a better deal elsewhere.
Mr Rose was a natural person for him to talk to, as he had been a colleague
at Bentley colliery near Doncaster until 1985. Mr Belk worked there until
last March when his leg was fractured in an accident which has needed
extensive treatment. After eight months' sick leave he was made redundant
when the pit closed.
Had Mr Belk stayed in the mineworkers' pension scheme, his injury might have
proved bad enough to enable him to leave mining on the grounds of ill
health. In this case, according to Mr Belk's calculations which British Coal
said seem accurate, he would have been eligible for a pension of about
Pounds 100 a week, with a Pounds 15,000 lump sum.
Opting out appears to have cost Mr Belk a lot. By his normal retirement age
he would have been paid about Pounds 130,000. But the Britannic scheme has
no provision for early payment for ill-health. When he was made redundant he
got a one-off sum of Pounds 26,000 from British Coal.
Mr Belk said the possible snags to opting out were not properly explained at
the time: 'I feel Wayne should have told me more about the disadvantages of
leaving the miners' scheme. In my view he didn't give me the best advice.'
Mr Rose said he did not want to discuss Mr Belk's case, but Mr Brian Shaw,
Britannic's general manager, said the case was one of 'about 12' which the
company was investigating with a view to a possible transfer back to the
original occupational scheme. He said: 'It was not our practice to encourage
people to opt out (of occupational schemes). With hindsight we probably gave
(Mr Belk) poor advice.'
Cases such as Mr Belk's illustrate the controversy about some of the methods
used to sell personal pensions and whether the companies involved had full
knowledge of their sales agents' activities, especially when
personal-pension sales took off in the late 1980s.
There have also been questions about the extent to which the main industry
regulatory bodies - including the Securities and Investments Board, the
Lautro insurance industry watchdog and Fimbra, which regulates independent
financial advisers - have controlled the activities of individual sales
agents.
About 150,000 people in the UK sell personal-investment products including
pensions on behalf of more than 5,000 companies.
The pensions industry distinguishes between opt-outs - involving people such
as Mr Belk who moved into a personal pension while continuing to work for a
specific employer - and pension transfers which have been far more common.
Pension transfers take place when a person shifts his or her benefits from
an occupational scheme into a personal scheme after leaving an employer.
Industry estimates put the number of opt-outs since 1988 at between 5,000
and 30,000. In contrast there have been  1/2 m or more pension transfers.
The total value of all opt-outs and transfers is put at about Pounds 6bn.
Many big pension companies say they have never encouraged opt-outs because,
assuming people remain in employment, they are invariably better off staying
in an occupational scheme where the employer makes a substantial
contribution to overall benefits. The merits of pension transfers for
employees are, on the other hand, more difficult to assess. As an employer
is no longer contributing to his or her benefits a personal pension may be
more attractive.
A KPMG Peat Marwick study in December for SIB found that in nine out of 10
cases where people had transferred into a personal pension from an
occupational pension there was no evidence that sales agents had met
regulators' standards. In more than one in three cases, the files suggested
that suspect advice had been given.
The exact number of people who received poor advice when switching pensions
 -either through opt-outs or transfers - should become clear this summer
when SIB completes an inquiry into the issue. Preliminary industry estimates
put the likely figure at between 20,000 and 100,000. Estimates for the cost
to the industry of compensating people who have suffered from poor advice
vary widely, from Pounds 100m to Pounds 1bn. The cost will depend on how
easy and costly it is to reinstate people into occupational schemes.
The biggest companies in the transfer business include Prudential, with
about 80,000 cases, and Allied Dunbar, Legal &amp; General, Pearl, Lloyds Abbey
Life and TSB each with an estimated 50,000 cases. Sun Alliance and Britannic
have arranged about 30,000 each, National Westminster Bank about 25,000,
Scottish Amicable 18,000 and Barclays about 12,000. Most of these companies
also have arranged some opt-outs but the figures are much smaller.
Mr Jon Minchin, managing director of Surrey-based Pensionline, which gives
independent advice on pensions, said there was significant mis-selling of
personal pensions in 1988 and 1989, mostly where companies gave people in
occupational schemes an over-optimistic view of possible benefits from
opting out.
Mr Minchin said: 'Lots of companies came into the market to take advantage
of the change (in legislation in 1988). They thought Christmas had come
twice: it was a marvellous way to make money. The government created a
market and then failed to regulate it properly.'
An Allied Dunbar official said 'complexities' in the pension transfer
business had come to light in the past few years. 'If we'd known then what
we know now we would have approached the issue of training the sales force
differently, we would have brought more things directly to their attention.'
L&amp;G said: 'In the past couple of years we have put the right mechanisms in
place to ensure that the best advice is given. But as to what was going on
in 1987-92, God only knows.'
In 1992 TSB set up a special pensions unit, separate from the sales force,
to consider appropriate transfer values in these cases. It said: 'Initially
we wanted to focus the skill base; we realised the sales force was not
always addressing the right issues.'
The case of Mr Paul Ruthven, 32, a tyre builder with Goodyear in
Wolverhampton, illustrates the point. In 1987 he opted out of the Goodyear
occupational scheme, taking a personal pension with TSB. He said: 'The TSB
agent advised me that when I retired I would be better off in the TSB scheme
than if I stayed with Goodyear. Because he was an easy sort of bloke I
trusted him.'
Last year, when Mr Ruthven told TSB he was unhappy with his pension, it
agreed to transfer him back to the Goodyear scheme, and paid Pounds 7,500 to
the scheme to make up for lost benefits. TSB said it accepted that in this
case poor advice had been given.
It is not hard to find reasons why agents sometimes give the wrong advice.
Most are paid by results, and the pressures can be very great.
One salesman, who asked not to be named, said he worked for three years
until 1992 as an agent with Acuma, a seller of personal finance products
including pensions that up to last year was owned by American Express. It is
now part of the United Friendly insurance company.
The agent worked in Redhill with about 12 other sales men and women, part of
Acuma's total sales staff of 300. 'We described ourselves as salaried
employees, but you got your salary only if you met specific sales targets. I
was told I would be paid Pounds 1,000 a month, but I realised soon after
starting that to earn this I had to to sell around Pounds 3,000 worth of
business, amounting to seven or so pensions or similar products. If you
didn't meet the target, you owed the company money on the salary you had
been paid but hadn't earned.'
He added: 'Some colleagues ran up large debts. The average time a salesman
lasted while I was there was six months.
Acuma said all its 300 agents were technically qualified and 'doing a good
job'. It had no figures on the average length of time sales people stayed
with the company. The Redhill office had been closed and practices there
might not have represented what happened across the company.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Effort for global ban on land mines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Government experts from 39 nations meet in Geneva this week to consider
proposals for a worldwide ban on the use of anti-personnel mines.
The International Committee of the Red Cross is leading the campaign for an
outright prohibition of these indiscriminate and long-lived weapons which
every month kill about 800 people and maim thousands, mostly civilians.
An estimated 85m-100m uncleared mines lie in more than 60 countries,
including 9m-10m in Afghanistan, 9m in Angola and 5m-10m in Iraq. Another
100m mines are stockpiled around the world.
The carnage inflicted by land mines, often long after a conflict, and the
vast tracts of land they leave uninhabitable, have led to growing support
for a ban or tougher international controls on their use.
The expert group meeting in Geneva, called for by a UN General Assembly
resolution last December, will look at ways to strengthen the UN's 1980
convention to curb use of inhumane conventional weapons. The group is to
present recommendations by the end of the year.
Short of a complete ban, the ICRC wants controls on mine manufacture, for
instance to require self-destruct mechanisms. A mine can be made for as
little as Dollars 3 (Pounds 2), and cost an average Dollars 1,000 to clear.

The government of President Rafael Caldera suspended at the weekend the
constitutional provisions of freedom of economic activity without government
restrictions.
This initiative, arising from what the government sees as an economic and
financial 'emergency' for Venezuela, gives the executive broad powers to
issue decrees in economic and financial matters that would usually be the
responsibility of the Congress.
The first presidential decree under the new emergency powers suspended the
application of value-added tax (VAT) on retailing.
It was not immediately clear what other areas might be affected, but a
cabinet member said it was not the government's intention to maintain this
or any other suspension of constitutional rights indefinitely.
The last suspension of economic liberties in Venezuela lasted 30 years, and
was revoked in 1991.
The Caldera government, in office since February 2, faces an economic
recession, low prices for the country's principal export (petroleum), a
large government deficit, demand for greater spending from various sectors,
high inflation and a banking system in crisis.
The government took action on the retail VAT, which took effect on January
1, to clear up widespread confusion in business about its application, and
to avoid possible protests - and violence - due to a wave of retail price
increases since January. On February 27 five years ago, price increases
sparked three days of rioting and looting that left some 300 dead.
The administration which stepped down this month also tried to suspend
retail VAT but did not enact this properly. The Caldera administration plans
to replace VAT at all levels with a new sales tax and other taxes.
Mr Berend Roosen, president of Consecomercio, which represents Venezuela's
commercial sector, said the government's decision to suspend economic rights
was 'a step backward. A market economy is really what favours the country.'
In the presidential decree ordering the suspension of the economic
provisions, the government said it was motivated by 'serious conditions
affecting the economic and fiancial stability of the country', and
'speculative tendencies that could upset public order'.

FT  28 FEB 94 / IMF demands may delay debtdeal for Brazil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Citibank, the closing agent for Brazil's rescheduling of its private bank
debt, is ready to extend the deal's notification deadline. This suggests
concern over whether the International Monetary Fund will approve the
country's economic reforms.
The proposed extension comes at a difficult moment for Mr Fernando Henrique
Cardoso, finance minister. He is expected to announce today the next step in
his economic restructuring programme, and is running out of time to close
the bank deal and launch a bid for Brazil's presidency.
Citibank had announced a deadline of March 11 for notification by Brazil
that the exchange of old debt for new would go ahead on April 15, the last
date possible under existing agreements. Brazil needs an IMF accord before
the US Treasury will issue zero-coupon bonds to guarantee part of the
package.
But Citibank is now looking to extend the notification deadline for up to a
week. 'We are studying the possibility of giving notice of the debt exchange
a few days later than March 11,' said Mr William Rhodes, vice-chairman.
An IMF team is in Brazil looking at the reform package announced by Mr
Cardoso. This includes the promise of a balanced budget this year and a
planned new currency. The country is plagued by annual inflation of about
2,500 per cent.
But the IMF is thought to be pushing Brazil to run a budget surplus. It may
also be reluctant to grant Brazil an accord until Mr Cardoso's package is
implemented, especially given the country's record of signing then ignoring
letters of intent with the IMF.
According to a Brazilian banker, Citibank's decision does not mean the
Dollars 52bn (Pounds 35bn) rescheduling is yet threatened, but it does
suggest discussions with the IMF are tense. If the IMF does not sign the
accord, the creditor banks could arrange a further extension, although this
would be difficult for technical and timing reasons. As an alternative,
Brazil could buy the zero-coupon bonds in the market, but this would be
expensive and there may not be enough bonds available.
The extension may frustrate any presidential ambitions of Mr Cardoso.
Brazilian law requires that he resign and declare his candidature by April 2
for the election in October. He is thought to want to run, but only if his
reforms are on course and the bank deal is concluded. After Citibank's
extension, and delays to his economic package, he is running out of time to
act.
Mr Rhodes said the outcome of the IMF's discussions with Brazil should be
'clear within a couple of weeks. I remain optimistic there will be an IMF
letter of intent no later than a month from now and the exchange of
documents on April 15 will go ahead,' he said.
Nancy Dunne adds from Washington: The US has dropped its long-running trade
case against Brazil's patent, trademark and copyright laws, amid praise by
the US trade representative for Brazil's 'continued progress in improving
protection of intellectual property rights' and 'its leadership role through
early implementation of the Uruguay Round intellectual property provisions.'
Ending several days of intense negotiations, as Brazil sought to head off
sanctions, Mr Mickey Kantor, the representative, praised new Brazilian
regulations on technology transfer and increased efforts to enforce
trademark and copyright laws.
Brazil also has promised to introduce amendments to a pending industrial
property law to strengthen protections.

<TEXT>
High expectations surround Peru's largest ever privatisation, to be held in
Lima today. Three bidders are seeking control of the country's two
telecommunications companies, the capital's telephone company, CPT, and the
provincial and long-distance monopoly, Entel.
Telecommunications in Peru, now about to turn into what will effectively be
a five-year monopoly, are expected to boom. Peru has the lowest level of
telephone provision in South America - about 2.6 lines per 1,000
inhabitants.
The new owner will have to invest the equivalent of Dollars 1bn-Dollars
1.5bn (Pounds 671m-Pounds 1bn) in expansion. The bidders are all leading
world operators. All have provisionally signed contracts and put up
refundable deposits of Dollars 20m.
They are: a consortium headed by GTE of the US, of which Portugal's Radio
Marconi and Brazil's Empresa Brasileira de Telecomunicacoes have small
slices; South-western Bell of the US with Korea Telecom, whose other
consortium members are Daewoo, Mexico's Condumex group and the offshore
branch of Peru's Banco de Credito; and Telefonica de Espana with three local
partners.
The first two are considered the most likely contenders, with GTE reported
to have the edge. A source close to the contest forecast GTE might have to
pay Dollars 800m to secure CPT/Entel, compared with a base price of Dollars
525m.
CPT shares held privately, which account for almost 80 per cent of the
total, have soared on the Lima stock exchange in recent months.
The buyer today will acquire 35 per cent of CPT (the existing 20 per cent
stock held by the state being increased via a new share issue) and a similar
percentage of Entel. Remaining Entel shares will be released in packages
later, probably through the local stock exchange.
Bankers and businessmen are hopeful that the sale today will consolidate
international business confidence in Peru. The country can now offer
sweeping liberalisation of what was extensive state control of the economy,
structural adjustment, marked advances against subversion, and low inflation
(for South America), but a question mark hangs over legal stability and over
official attitudes to respect for human rights.

FT  28 FEB 94 / A hatred that went unbridled and remains on the loose
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Dr Baruch Goldstein did not disguise his hatred for Arabs. The US-born
Jewish settler, who massacred some 43 Palestinians in the Cave of the
Patriarchs last Friday, had given recent interviews, describing Arabs
variously as 'the root of evil', 'a sickness in our society' and 'Nazis'.
He had stressed the need for Jews to react more forcefully to Palestinian
'terrorism'.
When one interviewer asked him about the apparent contradiction between such
views and his profession of medicine, he replied: 'No. There is a time to
heal and a time to kill.'
A few days before his dawn massacre at the mosque, it emerged yesterday, he
had confided to two people - one a friend, the other a rabbi - that he was
planning an act that would shock the world.
Yet, despite his frequent public racist pronouncements, the Israeli security
forces, which operate intensively among the Arab population of the occupied
territories, did not consider him a serious threat. Worse, those security
forces for months ignored clear evidence that many radical settlers were
planning violent anti-Arab actions.
Even when the settlers had begun to translate threats into action, few
offenders were severely punished.
In the half-year since Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, and Mr Yitzhak Rabin,
Israeli prime minister, shook hands on the White House lawn, there have been
frequent efforts by settler extremists to honour their commitment to torpedo
the peace negotiations.
During last December alone - the month when the Israeli army was originally
supposed to have begun pulling out of the West Bank and Gaza  - at least
four Palestinians were killed by settlers in the Hebron area, where
Goldstein lived: three shot from a passing car, one at a settler roadblock.
On several occasions, small settler vigilante groups have virtually taken
over central Hebron, firing at random down the main streets, with soldiers
watching alongside the bearded gunmen, either disinclined or afraid to get
involved.
In the aftermath of a Palestinian attack on a Jewish target, settlers would
enter Arab villages in convoys, firing into the air, breaking windows,
overturning cars, shouting death threats through loud-hailers.
In recent months, at least six extremist supporters of the assassinated
racist Rabbi Meir Kahane have been arrested for smuggling arms into Israel
for use against Palestinian targets.
From the central Jerusalem offices of the Kach movement, founded by Kahane
and enthusiastically supported by Goldstein, Kahane's heirs have been
enthusing for months about their plans to attack Palestinian policemen when
the Israeli army eventually withdraws from Palestinian autonomous areas.
'We want to increase the friction,' boasted Kach activist Noam Federman
recently. 'Then there'll be anarchy, and the army will be forced to come
back to restore order.'
It is an indication of the extent of Goldstein's hatred that he could
massacre innocent people at prayer, at a site sacred not only to Moslems but
also the second most holy place to Jews.
Also, it is an indication of the support for such extremist sentiment that
dozens of fellow-settlers have spoken out this weekend not merely to defend
Goldstein, but to praise him.
Ordering a crackdown on Goldstein's colleagues from Kach and other extremist
groups, the Israeli cabinet yesterday promised to place a handful in
adminstrative detention, disarm 20, and restrict the movements of a few
dozen.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Beirut church bomb kills 10
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ten Lebanese Christians were killed and at least 60 wounded yesterday when a
bomb exploded during Mass at the Sayyidet Al Najat Maronite church at Zouk,
north of Beirut.
It was the second bomb to be aimed at Lebanese Christians in the past two
months. In December, a car bomb exploded outside the Phalange party
headquarters, killing three and injuring more than 130.
Witnesses said dozens of people were taking Communion when the 82mm mortar
bombs exploded. They had been placed by the first row of pews. The priest,
Father Antoine Sfeir, was seriously wounded in the blast.
No group claimed to have carried out yesterday's attack and Beirut was rife
with speculation over what the perpetrators' motive may have been.
Many Lebanese linked the killing to the massacre at Hebron in the West Bank
on Friday, when 43 Palestinians were gunned down by a Jewish settler while
praying at a mosque. A former prime minister, Mr Salem Al Hoss, said: 'The
link with the Hebron tragedy is suspect, yet inevitable. It is beyond me why
anyone would respond this way.'
However, Mr Michel Samaha, Lebanese minister of information, suggested that
the bomb might have been an act of protest against Pope John Paul's proposed
visit to Lebanon at the end of May.
'It could be aimed against the pope's visit, and we hope it was not carried
out by those who were against this visit,' Mr Samaha said. He also pointed
his finger at Israel, saying it was an attempt to divert international
attention from the Hebron massacre.
Several of Lebanon's Moslem fundamentalist groups have condemned the pope's
plans to visit the Middle East, which will include stops in Lebanon and
Israel. But a diplomat in Beirut said it was more likely that the bomb was
the result of a dispute among the Lebanese Christians themselves.
The pope, speaking in St. Peter's Square in Rome yesterday, denounced the
bombing. Referring to Lebanon's 17-year civil war, between 1975 and 1992, he
said: 'That country has already suffered too much.'
In Washington, President Bill Clinton condemned the bombing as an 'outrage'
and said the extremists who committed the act were promoting division and
war.
Meanwhile, in south Lebanon, clashes between the Israeli army and its south
Lebanon army allies, and pro-Iranian and Palestinian resistance, erupted
intermittently throughout the day. The SLA said it had killed four
guerrillas. One SLA militia man was seriously wounded, and died in an
Israeli hospital.

FT  28 FEB 94 / PLO sets tough terms for talks
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Palestine Liberation Organisation is expected to refuse to rejoin peace
talks with Israel this week unless Israel takes stronger action to disarm
Jewish settlers and assure the protection of Palestinians in the occupied
territories.
But despite tough conditions for its participation being set by the PLO, the
US is still hoping to bring negotiators from the two sides to Washington.
Senior PLO officials gathered late last night at the villa of Mr Yassir
Arafat, PLO chairman, for an emergency meeting. Before the deliberations
began, Mr Arafat dismissed as 'empty' and 'hollow' the Israeli cabinet's
decision to disarm the most extremist groups among the settlers.
PLO officials also said they considered the 'goodwill gesture' of offering
the release of 800-1,000 Palestinian prisoners to be insufficient. The
officials said they expected the PLO to refuse to accept a US invitation to
resume peace negotiations in Washington on Wednesday without tougher action
from Israel.
Mr Nabil Shaath, the PLO's chief negotiator in detailed talks on an eventual
Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, said before last night's meeting
that the PLO had accepted the invitation only in principle. He said: 'There
are requirements for continuation of the talks - mainly the protection of
the Palestinians from the settlers.'
PLO officials said they expected a statement from the Tunis meeting to
include questions on exactly which and how many Jewish settlers Israel
intended to disarm. However, Mr Shaath explicitly refused to call such
requirements 'preconditions', suggesting that however bitter the reaction to
the massacre in Hebron on Friday of more than 40 Palestinians, many in the
PLO feel it cannot be allowed to jeopardise the talks altogether.
In Washington, President Bill Clinton telephoned Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the
Israeli prime minister, and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt on Saturday
evening in an effort to keep the peace talks moving in the wake of Friday's
massacre in a Hebron mosque. 'Mubarak said he would do everything he could
with Arafat and Rabin to keep the process going and that he was confident
the talks could be kept on track,' a White House official said.
US officials said emotions were clearly running high after Friday's attack,
but the best way of meeting Palestinian demands for better security
guarantees in the West Bank was to complete the peace process.
'If in fact we can move as quickly as possible to an agreement and
implementation, that's the best way to change the realities on the ground in
a way that will also discredit those who are determined to try to do it (the
peace process) in,' a senior administration official said.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Algerian pact with IMF soon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Algerian leaders are expected to sign a letter of intent with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the next few weeks after the visit to
Algiers last week by Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF director-general.
After signing the letter, the government, led by Mr Redha Malek, is expected
to seek a rescheduling of Algeria's debt to sovereign creditors through the
Paris Club. The stage would then be set for France to seek from its European
Union partners a loan to help support Algeria's balance of payments worth
around Dollars 1bn (Pounds 685m)
Two factors have forced the Algerians to reschedule official debt, something
they had long sought to avoid. The more immediate is the sharp decline last
year in the price of hydrocarbons, which will reduce the country's foreign
income by a fifth this year to about Dollars 8bn. Just as important is the
domestic decision, two years ago, to reverse the bold economic reforms
launched in 1989. The IMF and the country's international creditors had
given their imprimatur in June 1991.
Stalling on essential reforms and the weakening price of oil, which accounts
for the bulk of the country's foreign receipts, will in the absence of any
agreement with its international creditors push the cost of servicing
Algeria's foreign debt to Dollars 9bn in 1994, which is more than its
foreign income.
Once Algeria reaches agreement with the IMF on a broad package of reforms,
it can expect a one-year stand-by credit of Dollars 500m and an oil
compensating facility of Dollars 300m. A Paris Club rescheduling of the
principal repayments, due in 1994, of Algeria's Dollars 13.5bn bilateral
debt with OECD governments would release an estimated Dollars 3.75bn.
There is also a growing consensus among Algeria's leading state creditors in
the west for avoiding a cut in the volume of export credits such as often
occurs after Paris Club reschedulings. Algeria was able last year to draw on
Dollars 3bn of export credits from OECD countries. Japan, which has until
recently made public its hostility to rescheduling, now seems more willing
to accept this approach over Algeria.
The Algerian security forces killed Jaffar El Afghani, head of the Islamic
Armed Group (GIA), the most radical islamic group in Algeria, and eight of
his followers in the Algiers suburb of Bouzareah on Saturday night. The
'holy war on Christians, Jews and non-believers', launched a year ago by the
GIA, has cost the lives of dozens of Algerians and 30 foreigners.
The two paramount leaders of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), Mr Abassi
Madani and Mr Ali Belhadj, have been moved meanwhile to the comfortable
hunting lodge of Chateau Holden at Douera near Algiers from the prison at
Tizou Ouzou.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Nuclear inspectors fly to North Korea: First step this week
in deal with Washington
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON

<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An international nuclear inspection team is expected to arrive in North
Korea tomorrow as the first step under a deal concluded between Washington
and Pyongyang at the weekend.
North Korea agreed to allow entry to an inspection team from the
International Atomic Energy Agency to examine seven declared facilities at
the Yongbyon nuclear complex.
The North this week will also begin 'working level' discussions with South
Korea on preparations for an exchange of presidential envoys by mid-March.
This could pave the way for an unprecedented summit meeting between the
leaders of the two Koreas.
South Korean President Kim Young-sam offered on Friday to meet his North
Korean counterpart, Mr Kim Il-sung, in an attempt to resolve suspicions
about the North's nuclear programme.
In return, the US agreed to hold a new round of high-level negotiations with
North Korea on possible diplomatic recognition and economic aid.
The talks will begin on March 21, timed to coincide with the end of the IAEA
inspections.
The US and South Korea will also cancel this spring's joint Team Spirit
military exercise if the North fully co-operates with the IAEA inspections
and progress is achieved in the inter-Korean talks.
The planned deployment of US Patriot missiles, meant to protect South Korea
against the threat of an attack by North Korean Scud missiles, may also be
delayed.
Details of the package deal will be formally announced tomorrow as soon as
the IAEA team arrives in North Korea.
However, analysts in Seoul warn that the conditional nature of the US and
South Korean concessions could provide a pretext for the North to raise
last-minute objections. Pyongyang has consistently demanded firm guarantees
on the suspension of Team Spirit and new US-North Korean talks in return for
allowing the IAEA into Yongbyon.
Disagreements over how the two sides would co-ordinate their actions delayed
the planned trip of the IAEA inspectors to North Korea this month after
Pyongyang agreed in principle to their visit.
The IAEA will try to determine whether the North has diverted plutonium from
its Yongbyon reactor since the last full inspections were conducted a year
ago.
But that examination will not end the controversy over the North's nuclear
programme. The IAEA still wants to investigate two undeclared facilities,
believed to be nuclear waste sites, at Yongbyon to determine if the North
extracted more plutonium than it declared after it shut down its reactor in
1989.
The North has repeatedly said it will not allow an inspection of these two
sites. It threatened to pull out of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty
last March and blocked regular IAEA inspections after the IAEA demanded to
see the two undeclared sites.
But officials in Seoul believe the North may be using this issue to win US
diplomatic recognition in return for accepting the IAEA demand.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Malaysia's fury may scare investors: The UK ban could
rebound on Kuala Lumpur
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since Friday's official announcement that Malaysia would no longer give
contracts to British companies, the Malaysian government and the local media
have been emphasising the serious consequences of the move for British
business.
If the Malaysian government carries through its threat - and there is little
at this stage to indicate any softening of Kuala Lumpur's position - many
hundreds of millions of pounds' worth of contracts for British companies
will be lost. Some companies could be forced to lay off workers in Britain.
But Malaysian businessmen privately admit that the move could also have
serious consequences for Malaysia.
On the broader side of things it could give the impression, already held in
some quarters, that Malaysia is a difficult country to do business with.
Malaysia, for all its recent economic success, is still dependent on foreign
investment, especially in areas of high technology. Last year foreign
investments in Malaysia fell by 66 per cent to MDollars 6bn (Pounds 1.5bn).
British fund managers have been among the largest foreign investors in Kuala
Lumpur's booming stock market, but no one is as yet suggesting a wholesale
retreat from investing in what is one of the world's fast growing economies
and one of the best performing of the emerging markets.
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, has always put himself
forward as an economic pragmatist. 'I'm sometimes nasty to governments,
never to businesspeople' he said recently.
But last week's action will undoubtedly provoke some cautious thoughts among
investors and companies contemplating doing business in the country.
Malaysia's leaders have been insisting that the country can do without
British companies. In the long term this may well be true. But over the past
six years British companies have built up very close relationships with
partners in Malaysia and, in many areas, Malaysia has come to rely on
British expertise.
In the power sector, for example, British companies have been heavily
involved in both the supply of equipment and consultancy work for Tenaga
Nasional, Malaysia's partially privatised electricity utility.
The UK's National Grid company was instrumental in drawing up plans to
rectify serious shortcomings in the power supply system following a
countrywide blackout in late 1992. It was also reported to be considering
taking a 20 per cent stake in a new Malaysian company to install vital
transmission lines.
All that work will now be undone; future maintenance and supply contracts
involving British equipment will be withdrawn. This could cause serious
complications in a sector vital to Malaysia's onward economic growth.
In the defence sector, Dr Mahathir recently announced that Malaysia was
embarking on a comprehensive programme to build up its aerospace industry.
The growth of this will come, in the first instance, mainly from 'offset'
agreements reached with suppliers to Malaysia's civil and military aviation
sectors. Under the 1988 memorandum of understanding between Britain and
Malaysia on British defence sales, Malaysia bought 28 British Aerospace Hawk
trainers and fighters. The first of those was only recently delivered to
Malaysia.
Part of the Hawk purchase agreement was a MDollars 400m 'offset' programme
involving the transfer of British technology to Malaysia and extensive
maintenance and training agreements. Such programmes are central to
Malaysia's aerospace industry plans.
Malaysia says it will stand by existing contracts, including the Hawk
purchase. But given the prevailing atmosphere, further complex defence
agreements involving vital maintenace work and training for millions of
dollars worth of equipment already purchased might prove difficult to reach.
In the present circumstances, virtually anything or anyone British is liable
to be treated with some suspicion, if not hostility. Firms like Schroders,
the London merchant bankers, which has been advising the Malaysian
government on its privatisation programme and other projects, might now find
life rather difficult.
Malaysian companies involved in trading with Britain might also be a little
nervous. Malaysia runs a healthy trade surplus with Britain. No one has as
yet suggested retaliatory action by Britain against Malaysia. But if the
present argument escalates then Proton, the Malaysian car maker, could
suffer.
The UK is by far the biggest export market for Proton: it sold just under
15,000 cars in Britain in 1992 and more than 16,000 last year. Britain is
also the launching pad for Proton's plans to capture a share of the market
elsewhere in Europe.
Malaysia, intent on making a political point, seems to be unconcerned about
any adverse reaction arising from its move against British business. Mr
Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's deputy prime minister, said at the weekend that
the move 'does not involve two-way trade, business relationships and
investment.'
Many British companies would beg to disagree.

Malaysia
In the present circumstances, many British companies might question whether
the members of the British media have anything in their heads at all.
Not so Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister. He says the British
have brains. The only trouble is the British media have a 'colonial brain',
which assumes the leaders of developing countries such as Malaysia are
corrupt and could be corrupted anytime. 'USDollars 50,000 for the prime
minister and you can get a contract worth Dollars 1bn . . .' ponders Dr
Mahathir.
The New Straits Times, Malaysia's largest selling English language daily,
reports Dr Mahathir as being in a state of disbelief at the idea.
The government in Malaysia does not control the media - it more or less owns
them. A company closely connected to Dr Mahathir's United Malays National
party (UMNO), the country's dominant political party, controls the New
Straits Times Press group, the largest publishing house. UMNO's influence
also stretches into other publications. All have been solidly behind
Malaysia's action against Britain.
Utusan Malaysia, the biggest selling Malay-language newspaper, says Dr
Mahathir is teaching the west a new lesson. 'We support the strong and
uncompromising stand to close the door on British firms - this is an
effective way to deal with people arrogant with freedom and power which they
claim to possess.'
The editor of Malaysia's New Sunday Times (no relation) is in despair about
what he says are the sagging standards of the British press. '. . . The
British media, particularly the print component, has degenerated as a result
of the country's stagnating economy and growing competition . . . while the
tabloids, famous for their bare-breasted voluptuous Page Three girls, make
no pretence about their sensation-orientated reporting, the broadsheets are
fast becoming smear sheets on the pretext of telling the truth.'
The truth is also very much on Dr Mahathir's mind. Asked what he feels the
British media should do now, the prime minister tells New Straits Times
reporters that the whole thing is simple. The British must report the truth.
But, says Dr Mahathir, this is one thing they cannot do - 'They have never
understood what is meant by truth.'
And did Dr Mahathir want the British media to apologise? 'I don't want any
apology. Apology is not good enough.' Back to you John Major - or Rupert
Murdoch.
Britain
The British press, which so upset the Malaysian prime minister last week,
was characteristically unrepentant about the affair this weekend. Several
papers, indeed, seemed intent on twisting the knife by delving further into
British deals with Malaysia.
The Independent reported on Saturday that the UK made an advance payment of
Pounds 49m to Malaysia's government in 1986 to pass on to a company
controlled by members of one of its nine royal families. The scheme it was
destined for was scaled back, but no repayment ever made.
The Sunday Times, the main object of the Malaysians' fury, retorted with a
story that it had documents showing a specific commitment was made in 1988
by Mr George Younger, then UK defence secretary, to tie directly the amount
of aid awarded to Malaysia to negotiations for a Pounds 1.3bn arms deal. The
Observer claimed Malaysian officials had long been accusing British
companies of trying to 'rip off' their government on large contracts. Recent
UK press reports were no more than the 'last straw'.
But if the UK's deals with Malaysia gave investigative reporters a field
day, then Malaysia's response gave leader writers ample scope to write about
one of the subjects closest to their hearts: the sanctity of the free press.
Some chose direct attacks on the Malaysians for daring to challenge that
principle. The Guardian thundered that press freedoms 'have to be defended
and fought for. Dr Mahathir is out of world order (sic). We have to sit
tight and tell him so.'
The Sunday Times accused Dr Mahathir of having a 'well-honed anti-colonial
chip on his shoulder'. While it would be a 'shame' if British jobs were lost
because British newspapers were doing their job, it was entirely legitimate
that newspapers should seek to publicise government misdeeds.
But several papers pointed out to the Malaysians that much of the worst
criticism was reserved for the British government. As The Daily Telegraph
commented, 'Newspapers in a democratic society can hardly be blamed for
pursuing revelations which have shown the government to have been breaking
its own rules and then doing its best to disguise the fact.'

FT  28 FEB 94 / India budget expected to continue reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Manmohan Singh, the Indian finance minister, is expected to set out plans
for further economic reforms in his annual budget speech today.
Import duties, corporate taxes and possibly interest rates are likely to be
reduced to both promote growth and to continue with the economic
liberalisation programme which Mr Singh and Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the prime
minister, launched in mid-1991.
Mr Singh is also expected to announce measures to cut government borrowings,
which have soared so far above the targets that financial ministry officials
fear over-spending by the public sector could yet stifle efforts to
encourage the private-sector-led expansion. The government, in its Economic
Survey published last week, said the fiscal deficit for the year ending
March 1994 would be 'substantially higher' than the target of 4.5 per cent
of GDP.
Supporters of economic liberalisation have been pressing the government to
use the budget to bring the economy back to the top of the political agenda.
They believe much time was wasted last year when ministers' energies were
absorbed by the violence which swept Bombay and other cities.
Mr Tarun Das, general secretary of the Confederation of Indian Industry, the
employers' organisation, said last week: 'This budget must be dramatic, not
wishy-washy. It must contain substantive reforms. By next year it will be
too late because politicians will be taken up with the next general election
(which must be held by 1996).'
Stock market investors, including foreign fund managers who have put more
than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 685m) into Indian equities in the past nine months,
are also betting on a pro-reform budget. Share prices have doubled in the
past year and could fall sharply if the budget proves a disappointment.
The Economic Survey included some general indications of likely reforms. The
report said further reductions in government subsidies for food and other
commodities were necessary to help cut government spending. It urged
ministers to widen the tax net and replace the present complex system of
excise duties levied at varying rates with a simple value-added tax-based
system. It also called for the government to pull further out of the
economy, with more privatisation and an easing of controls on trade, land,
finance and labour.
Labour law reform is a particularly sensitive area because India's laws
severely limit employers' rights to make workers redundant or even to
redeploy them. The Economic Survey said companies could not gear up for
expanding production if they feared they might later be burdened with excess
labour.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Hosokawa tries to manage coalition as left and right split:
William Dawkins on a coming Tokyo cabinet reshuffle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, will this week consult his
coalition partners over plans for the first reshuffle of his six-month-old
cabinet, expected shortly.
Mr Hosokawa wants to bring coherence to the fragmented alliance to improve
its chances in a general election due in the next year or so. But he is
being pulled in opposite directions by growing rivalry between the
seven-party coalition's left and right wings.
One victim of the reshuffle is likely to be Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief
cabinet secretary, formerly one of Mr Hosokawa's closest colleagues and now
a critic.
Mr Takemura, the government's chief spokesman and Mr Hosokawa's chief of
staff, has been unhappy with his boss's handling of a controversial plan for
increasing indirect taxes. He also disagrees with the prime minister's
strategy of forming a single grand alliance to fight the opposition Liberal
Democratic party, dismissed last week by Mr Takemura as 'imperialistic' and
'expansionist'.
The reshuffle will also show how Mr Hosokawa plans to respond to the split
between the coalition's numerically strong left wing, of which Mr Takemura
is a leading figure, and the influential right wing, represented by Mr
Ichiro Ozawa, the government's backroom strategist.
Mr Takemura and his supporters in the Social Democratic party, the biggest
member of the coalition, oppose a reshuffle. In the opposite camp in the
coalition, Mr Ozawa's Japan Renewal party and its ally, the Buddhist-backed
Clean Government party, favour an early cabinet reorganisation, to
strengthen the alliance on their terms.
Mr Ozawa and his allies are aware that the coalition is unlikely to beat the
LDP in the next election, under a new electoral system, unless it fields
single joint candidates. Mr Ozawa precipitated the LDP's election defeat
last year by leading a defection from it and is dedicated to completing his
old party's downfall.
Underlying their tactical rivalry, the coalition's two camps have different
ideologies, in contrast to the days of LDP rule when influence, rather than
policies, dictated the balance of power.
Mr Ozawa's conservatives favour an internationally active Japan; the left
wing believes in a discreetly low profile in international affairs. They
also differ on economic, fiscal and industrial policy.
However, Mr Hosokawa cannot afford to alienate the Socialists, who hold six
of the 21 cabinet seats.
The left wing's power will be further increased by a recent accord between a
rising young Socialist politician and a powerful trade union leader to form
a new party.
The governor of the northern region of Hokkaido, Mr Takahiro Yokomichi, and
Mr Akira Yamagishi, chairman of Rengo, the trade union confederation - with
8m members - are planning to merge the Socialists, an offshoot of the
Socialists and Mr Takemura's NHP, to form a New Liberal party.
So far, Mr Hosokawa has been able to avoid committing himself to either side
of the power struggle, partly because his JNP is small enough to place it on
the edge of the battle. It is only the fourth largest in the coalition and
he is its only cabinet member.
On top of this, coalition members have, until the past few weeks, been too
consumed by the struggle for parliamentary agreement on political reform to
indulge in an internal power struggle.
But with reform and other urgent business such as the 1994 budget out of the
way, coalition leaders now have the time to get on with reshaping Japan's
political battle-lines.
Mr Hosokawa, did, however, lean towards the coalition's right last week,
when he came out in favour of Mr Ozawa's idea for a two-party scheme of a
grand alliance against the LDP, modelled on the US system, a change from the
prime minister's earlier preference for the multi-party Japan favoured by
the coalition's left wing. He also acted in line with Mr Ozawa's views in
proposing a rise in indirect taxation early this month, though the
Socialists quickly forced him to retract this.
Some observers believe Mr Hosokawa's best strategy would be to stay in the
middle and produce a cabinet reshuffle designed to appease both sides. That
would enable him to cultivate an image as honest broker between the
coalition's scheming rivals.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Rabuka wins second Fiji term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Sitiveni Rabuka, who led a military coup in Fiji seven years ago, is set
to be sworn in for a second term as the country's prime minister after
Fiji's week-long general election left his Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei
(SVT) party with an increased number of parliamentary seats.
The SVT won one extra seat in the election, taking its tally to 31. While
this is not a majority in the 70-seat parliament, the General Voters party,
which was the SVT's main coalition partner in the last government, took four
seats, compared with five previously. With support from a couple of
independent MPs, Mr Rabuka is expected to command a slim majority in
parliament and be in a position to govern.
The result is a severe blow for the Fijian Association, the new party formed
by SVT dissidents whose decision to vote down the 1994 budget triggered the
election. The FA won only five seats, against pre-election expectations that
it might gain a dozen.
Mr Rabuka first became prime minister as a result of the 1992 elections,
five years after leading two military coups which overthrew an
Indian-dominated coalition government.
On the fraught racial issue, Mr Rabuka said yesterday his party would this
year consider inviting Indians to join a so-called government of national
unity: 'That is still a possibility.' But he warned that no big changes
could be expected to government policies discriminating against Indians in
favour of Fijians.
The relatively decisive clear outcome of the election may come as a relief
to the business community. The country has been operating without a budget
for the current year.

FT  28 FEB 94 / German unions tighten screw: Wave of strikes planned this
week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour unrest in Germany will be stepped up this week, with a wave of
warning strikes hitting public services such transport and rubbish
collection, and plans for stoppages by postal and banking workers, on top of
the action already disrupting the engineering industry.
The lack of progress in wage negotiations last week both for the country's
3.5m public sector workers, and for 430,000 banking employees, has
precipitated the latest escalation in industrial action, although no
negotiation has broken down formally.
The OTV public sector union will call out local transport workers in North
Rhine-Westphalia today, and rubbish collection workers in Baden-Wurttemberg,
for brief token strikes to press its pay claim. It is seeking a 4 per cent
rise for its members to keep pace with inflation, while the federal, state
and local government employers are all insisting on an outright pay freeze.
HBV, the banking and insurance workers' union, will take longer to organise
its action, but brief stoppages are expected by the week's end.
In the meantime, IG Metall, the engineering workers' union, is pressing
ahead with its strike ballot of more than 90,000 members in the state of
Lower Saxony, to be held from Tuesday to Thursday, to decide on calling an
all-out stoppage from March 7. It has been running a campaign of brief
warning strikes by hundreds of thousands of workers for the past two weeks.
Mr Hans-Peter Stihl, the president of the German chambers of industry and
commerce, warned in a radio interview that the engineering employers would
react with lockouts to any strike action, in a bid to bring the action to a
swift halt. As an engineering employer himself, and a former leading
negotiator for Gesamtmetall, the employers' federation, he still insisted
that a negotiated solution to the dispute was possible.
The union is seeking a package of nominal pay rises and job security
guarantees; the employers are insisting on absolute cost cuts in exchange
for any guarantees.
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, warned in an interview in today's
mass circulation Bild Zeitung that any strike action would 'destroy the
gradual economic recovery' now under way. He urged both sides to agree on
'flexible deals, tailored to the differing needs of different branches and
regions, and the particular problems of individual enterprises'.
The public sector pay talks broke up without any new offer from the
employers' side on Friday night, after the third round of negotiations. The
government side, which involves both the conservative-liberal coalition in
Bonn, and many Social Democrat-dominated coalitions from the 16 federal
states, is insisting on a package of cuts in conditions and fringe benefits,
in addition to a pay freeze.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France yesterday defended its controls on fish imports after protests from
trade partners including the US, arguing that they were in line with world
trade rules and prevented fraud, Reuter reports from Paris.
'Once they are aware of the gravity of some of the fraud, no country will
question these measures,' Mr Jean Puech, French agriculture and fisheries
minister, said at the opening of the Paris Farm Fair. 'The US cannot but
accept our move.'
A ministry official said customs had destroyed an unspecified tonnage of US
fish which contained a chemical substance used to retain water in products
such as ham, meat and fish and which is illegal in France.
'It's fraud. A US trader was caught red-handed. . . US exporters will go
along with them if they want to do trade,' he said.
France started strict controls on fish imports on February 3 in an effort to
appease its angry fishermen hit by falling prices and cheap foreign imports.
The move raised strong protests from some of its non-European trade
partners.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Pressure builds in EU entry talks: Pace gets frenetic as
clock ticks away
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We Greeks use a Turkish term for this sort of situation - a bazaar,' Mr
Theodoros Pangalos, Greek chairman of the European Union's council of
ministers, said yesterday, summing up the frenetic negotiating to agree EU
entry terms for Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden by the deadline of
midnight tonight.
The Brussels talks - which have to conclude before March for the four
candidates to enter the EU next January - were multi-layered. The 12 member
states were still trying to agree a common line among themselves; the EU
negotiated separately with each applicant; and 11 working groups of experts
tried to mesh the interests of the 12 and and the four on outstanding issues
from tax regimes to fish quotas.
By yesterday evening, it looked as though Sweden and Finland would meet the
deadline - a possibility which Mr Pangalos, the 12 and the European
Commission were using to put pressure on the more difficult candidates:
Austria and, particularly, Norway.
The real crunch issues remained: money; lorry transit through the Austrian
Alps; Norwegian fish; and the largely intra-EU question of how many votes
are needed in a Europe of 16 to block measures in the council of ministers.
One money issue, EU regional aid, was resolved to all four candidates'
satisfaction yesterday. Austria's backward eastern province of Burgenland
will get the generous Brussels aid reserved for the poorest EU regions. The
thinly populated Nordic north will get a slightly less well-endowed special
Arctic regime. All told, the four will receive regional and employment aid
of about Ecu1bn (Pounds 750m).
But there was still confusion on both sides about how to accommodate Nordic
and Alpine agriculture, subsidised (except in Sweden) at 25-100 per cent
higher than already lavish EU levels. The 12 say they want Norway, Finland
and Austria to cut their prices straight after entry to EU levels, with the
applicants compensating farmers out of their own pockets.
In previous enlargements farm prices were equalised over long transition
periods, the differences being ironed out by levies collected at the
frontier - a method now rejected as a threat to the border-free single
market. Moreover, the old system (accession compensatory amounts) would in
theory cost the Union Ecu500m more, because the applicants export basic
products like wheat, with a full price refund, and import a lot of processed
foods like biscuits, with small amounts of levy-attracting wheat.
But the UK, and to some extent France, feel that applicant insistence,
particularly from Austria, that the EU pay part of the farm compensation
bill will make the so-called 'big bang' or single market solution more
expensive. Already, the Commission is suggesting chipping in Ecu1.6bn as a
transitional cushion for 1995, and total compensation in 1995-98 of
Ecu2.8bn, in addition to normal price support.
Many of the negotiators appear baffled by the detail, amid charge and
counter-charge of theological rigidity on budgets and borders. But those,
like Britain, who were looking closest at their pockets were holding fire
yesterday in the expectation that the applicants themselves would shoot down
the proposal as insufficient.
Wherever this argument settles will determine how much the four will
contribute to the EU budget. At the moment, Brussels reckons on smallish net
contributions for the newcomers of around Ecu1.7bn in all. Swedish and
Austrian demands that even this should be phased in were being firmly
resisted yesterday.
Austria's wish to retain an existing treaty restricting EU trucks transiting
the Alps - ultra-sensitive after the recent Swiss vote to ban lorries using
its own Alps - was getting more sympathy from the EU, which fears that a
green backlash could lose Austria its referendum on entry. Vienna wants to
retain the restrictions until 2004, which may be illegal under the EU
treaty. But a senior Austrian official said the two sides were 'trying to
find camouflage' for a formula very near what Austria needs.
Norway and its fish (the issue on which Norwegians voted against Europe in
1972) is another matter. There is not even a hint of a mid-point between
mainly Spanish demands for access to Norwegian fish and Oslo's refusal to
surrender a single cod. The EU, at French insistence, also wants safeguards
against Norwegian fish flooding into the single market. Germany, next after
Greece in the rotating EU presidency, yesterday took over 'intensive talks'
at expert level in search of a solution no one can yet discern even in
vaguest outline.
Within the EU, Britain wants to retain the weighted majority voting formula
through which 23 votes (normally meaning two big states and one small
country) out of 76 can block a law or measure, even though if all four
applicants enter, total votes will rise to 90. Spain agrees, in cases where
at least three member states oppose or abstain, but otherwise will accept
the majority view that the existing balance between small and big member
states means the threshold for a 'blocking minority' should move to 27 out
of 90.
The Benelux countries suspect the big states of a surreptitious power grab;
federalists fear setting higher thresholds for majority voting will hold
back integration; and the European parliament, which has to ratify the
accession treaty by May 4 to get the four in by next January, not only
flatly opposes the Anglo-Spanish ambitions but wants more radical
decision-making reform ahead of the scheduled 1996 constitutional review.
Mr Pangalos warned Spain and the UK yesterday that they could sink the
negotiations if they held fast to their existing blocking rights. 'They will
take responsibility for the political failure of enlargement,' he said.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Rose fearful for Bosnian ceasefires
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ceasefires agreed in Sarajevo and central Bosnia could fail if western
governments refuse to commit more ground troops, General Sir Michael Rose,
United Nations commander in Bosnia, warned yesterday.
Speaking after a week-long ceasefire in the Bosnian capital, Gen Rose said
the UN needed 3,000-5,000 troops to shore up the fragile peace. They were
urgently required, both in Sarajevo and in central Bosnia, where Croat and
Moslem military leaders started implementing a ceasefire last Friday.
Military experts, including Mr Michael Clark, head of the centre for defence
studies at London's King's College, believe at least 5,000 are required to
secure ceasefires in the main towns and cities.
Gen Rose said: 'I am a realist. In the end, all I can do is the best I can
with what I have got, but we are living on borrowed time.'
Meanwhile, peace talks are continuing in Washington between Mr Haris
Silajdzic, Bosnia's prime minister, Mr Kremir Zupak, head of the Bosnian
Croats, and Mr Mate Granic, Croatia's foreign minister.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, who has been closely involved,
said the three sides had 'a very special moment' to achieve peace. 'We need
to build on the ceasefire and success we've had in Sarajevo. We can't let
this moment slip by.'
US officials have already told President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia he risks
economic sanctions and isolation if he does not co-operate.
The Washington talks are being led by Mr Charles Redman, US special envoy to
the former Yugoslavia, Mr Steve Oxman, undersecretary of state for European
affairs, and Mr Victor Jackovich and Mr Peter Galbraith, US ambassadors to
Bosnia and Croatia respectively. They are aimed at setting up a
confederation, loosely linking territories held by Bosnian government forces
with those held by the Bosnian Croats, which in turn would have an
administrative arrangement with Croatia proper.
The plan would guarantee the Bosnian Moslem side a degree of political and
economic security. But Mr Silajdzic said the plan was 'complex and fraught
with difficulties'. US officials said it would also require Serbia to make
territorial concessions in eastern Bosnia.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Yeltsin weakened by rebels' amnesty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin has emerged weakened and humiliated by the release
of the leaders of last October's bloody parliamentary uprising in a debacle
which says more about his own administration's incompetence than about the
skill of his foes.
Eight men - including Mr Alexander Rutskoi, the former vice-president who
masterminded the uprising and is likely to run for president in 1996 -
walked free from Lefortovo prison on Saturday after a bungled presidential
attempt to block the amnesty. Others freed included General Albert Makashov,
who launched a bloody assault on Moscow's television tower, and Mr Alexander
Barkashov, leader of a blackshirted neo-Nazi militia which marched around
the White House and kept secret hideaways around town.
Their release has prompted popular fears of new bloody confrontations such
as that which cost 140 lives in October and placed Russia on the verge of
civil war. At the very least it sends a message that such violence can be
condoned in future, even if the likes of Mr Victor Anpilov, a hardline
Communist who has vowed to continue pressing for communism's return, may
find the political climate has changed.
Because the bulk of the conservatives in the state duma (lower house of
parliament) have sought to project a respectable non-violent appearance, the
real danger comes from the indirect consequences of new threats, perceived
and real, which may come from Russia's extremists. The release could
strengthen the hand of those who think Russia needs a return to strong
repressive rule. These include members of the president's entourage and Mr
Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
It will also heighten fears of future instability at a time when the economy
needs stability above anything. Mr Rutskoi's freedom in particular will
provide Mr Yeltsin with a constant critic who can say that, strictly
speaking, he is the country's legal president because Mr Yeltsin violated
the constitution last October. Only the rebellion helped balance the
picture, by portraying his opponents as dangerous men ready to stoop to mob
violence. The amnesty now rehabilitates them.
Perhaps most damaging was the evidence the debacle provided of incompetence
in the president's entourage. The organisers of the rebellion, who said they
were only defending the constitution, were released at the very moment the
president's new assistant, Mr Georgy Satarov, was negotiating with the
parliamentary chairman, Mr Ivan Rybkin, on postponing their release.
Legalistic grounds for a postponement were contained in a letter from the
president to Mr Rybkin saying the parliament had in fact pardoned the men
when it only had the constitutional right to amnesty them. The letter to Mr
Rybkin proposed that parliament do some more work on the amnesty before it
could be implemented.
As one former liberal cabinet minister pointed out: 'There are always tricks
which the administration can produce to deal with such situations, except
here it failed to deliver.' The letter containing the relevant 'trick' was
delivered to parliament well after Mr Yuri Baturin, a lawyer who is the
president's national security adviser, first came up with the formula, and
after Mr Yeltsin ignored the amnesty in a state of the nation address.
By Saturday, a deputy to Mr Alexei Kazannik, the prosecutor-general who
resigned because he could not comply with Mr Yeltsin's requests to stop the
amnesty, had already set in motion the process for their release. Mr Baturin
and Mr Sergei Karaganov, a member of the president's advisory council, said
the incompetence was Mr Kazannik's.
Mr Kazannik is to be replaced by Mr Alexei Illyushenko, a presidential aide
involved last summer in launching unsubstantiated corruption allegations
against Mr Rutskoi.
Part of the blame must be shared by the president himself. Mr Yeltsin's
desire to play the statesman devoted to national reconciliation meant that
he failed to focus sufficiently early on the possible consequences of the
amnesty.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Japan sets its face against further boost to economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's finance minister, Mr Hirohisa Fujii, yesterday dismissed suggestions
that his country should do more to stimulate its economy, saying there were
no further plans to boost domstic demand.
On his return from a weekend meeting of finance ministers from the Group of
Seven leading industrialised countries near Frankfurt, Mr Fujii said: 'We
are not contemplating additional fiscal steps, because the package we just
announced was very large.'
The Japanese delegation insisted that the more than Y15 trillion (Pounds
95bn) package would accelerate reduction of the trade surplus. But other G7
members said Japan had yet to prove its commitment to strengthening demand.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, said: 'What Japan has done is not
sufficient to get the kind of growth in demand that would have a serious
effect on their budget.'
Other finance ministers stressed that dealings between the US and Japan were
amicable, but that no progress was made on their trade dispute.
The ministers also avoided discussion on currency co-operation, agreeing
that exchange rates must not be used to cut Japan's huge trade surplus.
'I expressed concern that any precipitous yen appreciation would undermine
the effects of Japan's efforts to expand domestic demand,' said Mr Fujii
immediately after the meeting, which went out of its way to soothe market
fears of rising interest rates.
Mr Eddie George, Bank of England governor, was puzzled by the recent bond
market shake-out, which he thought was 'possibly an over-correction. . . .
On the evidence we have heard today, a possible repeat of 1987 is
exaggerated,' he added. 'I cannot see any grounds for thinking the stability
we have achieved is at risk.'
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, said 'mistaken assessments' had
given rise to fears that US inflation was on the way up. But these concerns
would not last, and markets would soon calm down from their recent
'over-reaction'.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor, said the news from continental Europe was
significantly more encouraging than it had been at previous recent meetings,
with no danger of the recoveries faltering.
However, Mr Bentsen reiterated his call for European countries, in
particular Germany, to lower interest rates more rapidly. 'Given the
progress Europe has made on inflation, we believe the authorities should
take advantage of any opportunities to reduce rates further,' he said.
Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister and chairman of the G7 meeting,
repeated official forecasts that the German economy was on track for 1.5 per
cent growth this year.
French representatives had said they expected a further growth spurt in the
second half of this year.

FT  28 FEB 94 / G7 ties Russian debt to accord with IMF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KRONBERG, GERMANY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Group of Seven industrialised states told the Russian government this
weekend that it must reach an agreement with the International Monetary Fund
on stabilising inflation and the government deficit before any further debt
rescheduling can be negotiated. At the same time, the G7 finance ministers
want to give more help, particularly through the World Bank, to set up a
proper social security system, thus easing the political backlash against
economic reform.
They suggested World Bank funds from the Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) special
privatisation programme could be used to help set up a social safety net,
although the main resources for any such system would have to come from
Russia itself.
The tough line in insisting on prior agreement with the IMF before any new
round of official debt rescheduling in the Paris Club emerged from
Saturday's meeting between the G7 finance ministers and central bank
governors, and a Russian delegation headed by Mr Sergei Dubinin, acting
finance minister.
It will put the new Russian government under severe time pressure to reach a
deal with the IMF on the conditions for the release of a second Dollars
1.5bn tranche of its special transformation facility, and a Dollars 4.1bn
stand-by credit.
The current agreement on rescheduling Dollars 15bn of official debt with the
Paris Club runs out at the end of April, after being extended by four
months.
Mr Alexander Shokhin, Russian economy minister, said after the talks that
the next meeting with the IMF was planned for mid-March, by when fund
officials would have had a chance to assess some basic budget figures
presented to them last week.
The Russian delegation told the G7 that they intended to reduce inflation in
Russia to a monthly rate of 7-9 per cent by the end of 1994, compared with
22 per cent at the end of 1993. Their planned budget deficit would be
brought down to 5 per cent of gross domestic product.
They also gave 'clear and formal assurances' that the new government
remained committed to the reform programme launched by the previous
administration, headed by Mr Yegor Gaidar.
The G7 ministers were clearly keen to give strong political support to the
reform process, and expressed some reassurance over those commitments. But
many remained profoundly sceptical about the Russian government's ability to
meet its targets. That is why they are insisting so firmly on an early IMF
agreement.
'We are still insisting on full respect for IMF conditionality,' Mr Henning
Christophersen, vice-president of the European Commission, said after the
meeting. 'We cannot have a situation where Russia is treated differently
from everybody else.'
The main way in which the G7 wants to express its political support is in
the drive to provide greater assistance in creating a proper social security
system. At the moment all Russian social assistance is provided in effect
from enterprises and factories, which may be sold off or closed down under
the privatisation programme.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Romanian unions call 2m on strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUCHAREST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
More than 2m Romanians, a fifth of the workforce, are due to take part in a
general strike today in what is expected to be the biggest show of union
strength since the end of Communist rule in 1989.
Alfa Cartel and CNSLR-Fratia, the two main union blocs, decided to go ahead
with the strike after President Ion Iliescu failed to resolve the conflict
and after inconclusive talks with the government.
The two union blocs are demanding the government implement a collective
labour contract for this year, improve the social security system, and speed
market-led reform.
The weak left-wing minority government has tried to head off the strikes but
the unions last week said its offer to negotiate would not be credible until
it had finished drafting its 1994 budget.
They have also criticised the government for not moving quickly enough to
implement a reform package agreed in December with the International
Monetary Fund. The delay is holding up IMF approval for a new stand-by
arrangement which would unlock Dollars 700m (Pounds 480m) in loans.
The unions say that, for the first time since 1989, 'the whole country will
feel the strike'. They plan to block roads and fuel deliveries, cut bread
production, interrupt telecommunications and shut down most of industry.
The mounting labour unrest has increased pressure on the governing Party of
Social Democracy in Romania to create a new pro-reform coalition. The PSDR
has given itself until tomorrow to complete negotiations on a new coalition
with hardline nationalist and former Communist parties, its allies in
parliament.
But the unions are refusing to support any such coalition and their tough
stance, as well as pressure from abroad, has also pushed the PSDR into
holding talks with pro-reform opposition parties.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Daimler-Benz head likely to chair Airbus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Edzard Reuter, chairman of Daimler-Benz and one of Germany's most
powerful industrialists, is likely to become the next supervisory board
chairman of Airbus Industrie, the European aircraft manufacturer.
The appointment would prompt significant board changes at Daimler-Benz,
Germany's largest industrial company. Deutsche Bank, the country's largest
bank, is likely to relinquish its traditional role as supplier of the
Daimler supervisory board's chairman.
Such a move would further weaken the two groups' link, which has been at the
heart of the traditional organisation of German industry, with banks playing
a direct role in supervising companies.
It confirms Deutsche Bank's intention to reduce its direct involvement in
German industry to concentrate on its mainstream banking. The bank also
plans to shed 3 per cent of its 28 per cent stake in Daimler.
Mr Reuter's move to Airbus is likely within the next year. It would
significantly strengthen the senior management of the European aircraft
manufacturing consortium as it faces intense competition from Boeing and
McDonnell Douglas, its two US rivals.
It would also reinforce Daimler's voice within the consortium, confirming
Germany's ambitions to enhance its role in the European aerospace industry.
Daimler, through its Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) subsidiary, owns a 37.9 per
cent in Airbus, with Aerospatiale of France also owning 37.9 per cent;
British Aerospace 20 per cent; and Casa of Spain the remaining 4.2 per cent.
Germany has traditionally held the chairmanship of the Airbus supervisory
board, whose members include the chief executives of the four partner
companies. The supervisory board takes all significant strategic decisions,
including the launch of new aircraft programmes.
Mr Reuter, the architect of Daimler's diversification into the aerospace
business, is officially due to step down at Daimler early next year.
However, European aerospace industry sources suggested that he might decide
to step down earlier to take over at Airbus from Mr Hans Friderichs, a
German businessman and former federal economics minister.
Should he decide to step down sooner, Mr Reuter is also being tipped to
replace Mr Hilmar Kopper, chief executive of Deutsche Bank, who chairs the
Daimler-Benz supervisory board. Mr Kopper would remain on the Daimler
supervisory board with the role of an ordinary director.
The Daimler board is expected to discuss the succession to Mr Reuter at a
meeting tomorrow that will also focus on Mercedes-Benz's decision to develop
a small city car with Swatch, the Swiss watchmaker. The meeting will
consider a proposal that the car should be marketed as a Mercedes.
Two candidates have already been tipped to succeed Mr Reuter. The favourite
appears to be Mr Jurgen Schrempp, head of Deutsche Aerospace Dasa. The other
is Mr Helmut Werner, head of Mercedes-Benz's car oper-ations, which account
for about 70 per cent of the group's overall turnover.

FT  28 FEB 94 / Malaysia tightens trade curbs on UK companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE and JAMES BLITZ AND JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Malaysian government has tightened its newly decreed trade restrictions
against the UK by outlining a range of projects in which British companies
will not be allowed to participate.
Mr Anwar Ibrahim, deputy prime minister, said at the weekend that Malaysian
companies negotiating joint ventures within the country's wide-ranging
privatisation programme would have to abandon talks with UK partners. 'They
should seek joint ventures with companies other than British ones,' he said.
Malaysia's ministers for defence and energy also announced that British
companies would not be allowed to tender for projects managed by their
departments.
Mr Najib Tun Razak, defence minister, said British companies would not be
allowed to participate in a joint venture to build 27 patrol vessels for the
navy, a project that might be worth more than Pounds 1bn.
Mr Samy Vellu, minister for energy, has also said that - in the short term -
British businesses might lose Pounds 370m worth of power projects in
Malaysia.
The Malaysians have instigated the restrictions on trade with the UK in
protest at British press allegations that bribes were offered to Malaysian
politicians, and at disclosures of a controversial link between a Pounds 1bn
defence contract won in 1988 and the Pounds 234m of aid provided for the
Pergau hydroelectric project.
British companies calculate that hundreds of millions of pounds' worth of
work will be lost in Malaysia and jobs in Britain might be under threat.
In London, Mr Richard Needham, a minister at the Department of Trade,
expressed concern about Malaysia's recent actions and issued a stinging
attack on the British press for its reporting of the Pergau dam affair. 'I
do blame the British press very directly for this situation. Its reporting
has been ridiculous.'
He was also concerned about the impact that British reporting might have on
UK trade with other countries in the region.
Allegations by MPs that the aid for the dam was illegally linked to a Pounds
1bn defence contract are certain to intensify this week.
Tomorrow the Commons will debate a Liberal Democrat motion on the matter. On
Wednesday, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, will be asked by MPs on the
Commons foreign affairs committee why he gave the final go-ahead for the
deal. The following day, Baroness Chalker, minister for overseas
development, will be questioned.
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minster, said in his first public
comment on the move that the action was based on steps by western countries.
'We have learnt from the west. They have so often used economic weapons to
force us to become democratic, to respect human rights and the environment.'

FT  28 FEB 94 / Pensions switch may have cost taxpayers Pounds 1.3bn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The UK life insurance industry may have earned Pounds 400m to Pounds 1.3bn
of taxpayers' money since 1988 by selling personal pensions, according to an
analysis of government statistics.
The figures also show that about 60 per cent of nearly 5m people who have
taken out personal pensions since 1988 are making no provision for
retirement other than the tax refund paid by the government after they opted
out of state pensions.
The analysis, by the Financial Times in consultation with actuaries, shows
that in the past five years the government has paid about Pounds 10.5bn to
people taking out personal pensions, in the form of rebates on national
insurance contributions. These are paid to encourage people to opt out of
the State Earnings- Related Pension Scheme and into personal pensions.
But insurance industry experts estimate that companies selling personal
pensions typically take 4 per cent to 13 per cent of an individual's tax
rebate in commissions and charges for sales agents and management fees.
Mr Frank Field, MP, chairman of the House of Commons social security select
committee, said it planned to start an inquiry into the transfer of tax
rebates into personal pension plans this April. 'We are going to follow the
pounds and see where they ended up,' he said. 'It is as worrying for the
individuals as it is for taxpayers.'
The figures show that by April 1992 more than 300,000 of the men and women
who contracted out of Serps through a personal pension were going to receive
lower benefits on retirement than if they had remained contracted in. That
is because the rebate system gives far more than a young person needs to buy
pension benefits equivalent to Serps, but far less than an older person
would need.
Department of Social Security and Inland Revenue data show that of the 4.7m
people with personal pensions in April 1992, only 40 per cent are saving
more towards retirement than the rebate itself. But DSS officials were
privately encouraged by recent figures showing an improvement on the 1989-90
tax year. Then, fewer than a third of personal pension holders made extra
contributions.
The rebate is paid to a personal pension account set up with an insurance
company in the individual's name. Low earners pay proportionately more of
their rebates to the insurers.
Mr David Dow, a partner at Wyatt Financial Services, which analyses life
insurers' fees, said: 'On a state contribution of Pounds 700 to Pounds 800 a
year, the impact of a Pounds 2-a-month charge is small. But if you only get
Pounds 200 per year, then the effect is quite great.'

FT  28 FEB 94 / PLO set to reject peace talks: Palestinians dismiss Israeli
plans to restrain Jewish extremists as 'hollow'
</HEADLINE>

The Palestine Liberation Organisation is almost certain to refuse a US
invitation to resume peace talks with Israel in Washington this week after
Friday's massacre in Hebron.
PLO officials yesterday brushed aside Israeli government plans to curb
Jewish extremists, describing them as hollow and not a basis for resuming
talks.
'It is too soon,' one official said. 'The blood is still warm.'
Before it agrees to rejoin the talks, the PLO is expected to demand more
extensive measures to disarm Jewish settlers in the Israeli-occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip and to protect Palestinians living there.
Another four Palestinians and a Bedouin were killed by Israeli troops and 57
others wounded as violent protests continued over the murder of 43 Moslems
during prayers at a mosque in the West Bank town of Hebron.
The Israeli cabinet instructed the attorney-general to consider outlawing
the racist Kach movement, of which Baruch Goldstein, the American-immigrant
doctor who carried out the Hebron killings, was a member.
The cabinet decided to place five Kach leaders in administrative detention,
disarm about 20, and restrict the movements of a few dozen. One Kach
activist, Shmuel Ben-Ishai, was arrested. 'We've decided to get tough with
the hard core of the extremists,' said Mr Yossi Sarid, environment minister.
Ministers said up to 1,000 Palestinian prisoners would be released in the
next few days.
Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the PLO, immediately dismissed the Israeli
moves as 'merely cosmetic', before meeting senior PLO officials at his home
in Tunis.
The Clinton administration said it hoped the Israeli action would induce the
PLO to agree to negotiations in Washington that could change 'realities on
the ground'. But these hopes received a blow when Syria, Jordan and Lebanon
yesterday broke off their peace talks with Israel in the US. The talks had
been due to end on March 2.
In dismissing the Israeli moves, Mr Arafat said: 'We were not expecting
better than this, because the Israeli government did not tackle the issue of
Israeli army involvement, nor provide the basis of international protection
for the Palestinian people, the issues that are very essential for a
successful end of the peace process.'
PLO officials said the meeting was expected to result in demands for tougher
Israeli action and a call for the United Nations Security Council to discuss
protection for Palestinians.
Officials avoided suggesting that Friday's atrocity might lead to an
outright abandonment of further peace talks, but said the issue of the
settlers would have to top the agenda if talks were to resume. 'If the
Palestinian people in the occupied territories do not have sufficient
protection, the entire peace process is immaterial,' added one official.
The Israel cabinet also ordered an official inquiry to establish why Israeli
soldiers failed to block Dr Goldstein's entry into the mosque, why they
failed to stop him firing more than 100 bullets into the rows of kneeling
Palestinian worshippers, and whether soldiers had themselves contributed to
the death toll.
Curfews yesterday failed to deter demonstrators throughout the occupied
territories. In one incident, a Palestinian teenager was killed in Gaza when
soldiers fired into a mosque. Three others died in the West Bank, bringing
the number of Palestinian dead since the massacre to 18.
The violence has also spread to the 800,000-strong Israeli Arab community,
with Jaffa, north of Tel Aviv, the focus of unprecedented clashes throughout
the weekend.
Meanwhile, several hundred people gathered in Jerusalem to pay their last
respects to Dr Goldstein, who was beaten to death after the massacre by
Palestinians inside the mosque.

FT  26 FEB 94 / International Company News: New Dollars 1.1bn mutual fund
rescinded by NYSE
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The New York Stock Exchange on Friday suspended trading in the shares of a
new Dollars 1.1bn international mutual fund that was to invest in privatised
companies, and forced the four - day-old share issue to be rescinded, after
the performance of privatised companies' stocks was found to have been
overstated in the fund's prospectus.
The rescinding of such a large stock issue, and the cancellation of all the
trades in the fund's shares that were completed last week, is thought to be
unprecedented.
Between February 18 and February 22, 74.5m shares in The Global
Privatisation Fund, managed by the New York money management group Alliance
Capital, were sold to investors at Dollars 15 each.
However, late last week an analyst at Alliance discovered that the
prospectus for the issue had exaggerated the performance of a composite
index of privatisation stocks.
A chart in the original prospectus had shown that the privatisation index
recorded returns of 170 per cent between the end of 1988 and September 1993,
a performance that compared favourably with several other indices quoted in
the offer document.
In fact, the privatisation index's return over a similar period was 94 per
cent, a poorer return than one of the other indices quoted in the
prospectus, a Morgan Stanley emerging markets index. Alliance Capital said
the mistake was the result of a 'glitch' in the calculations.
Once the error was discovered, the NYSE suspended all trading in the shares.
Alliance Capital, and the Wall Street investment bank leading the
underwriting of the issue, Kidder Peabody, immediately agreed to rescind the
issue and publish a new prospectus with the corrected data.
All trades in the funds shares made over the four days - and the NYSE said
about 4.1m shares had changed hands over the period - were cancelled.
Alliance Capital said that the new offer document would be mailed to
potential investors this week, and it hoped a new pricing date could be set
by Friday.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Clinton urges Congress to protect Moscow aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday urged senior members of Congress not to cut
off all aid to Russia, in response to the arrest in the US of a senior
Central Intelligence Agency officer on charges of spying for the Russian
intelligence service.
Seeking to fend off calls for an immediate freeze of US assistance, Mr
Clinton called Republican and Democratic leaders to the White House to
persuade them that aid to Russia, for such as reducing nuclear weapons and
promoting economic reform, remained in the US national interest.
'US support for reform in Russia does not flow from a sense of charity or
blind faith. Our policy is based on our clear American interests, clearly
pursued,' Mr Clinton said after the meeting.
Although he won support for the argument that the US should not overreact to
the spy incident, it was clear that the request for more Russian aid, in the
US budget next year, is in trouble. 'Aid is largely symbolism, and cutting
it off may well be the best symbolic message we could send,' a Congressional
official said.
Senior members of Congress are increasingly questioning not only the overall
amount of aid to the states of the former Soviet Union but also the
proportion that goes to Russia.
'While we all agreed that the spy incident would not, in and of itself,
warrant reconsideration of aid, there are a lot of other things that do. The
Russia-first policy, I think, is increasingly in disfavour in the Congress,'
warned Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, senior Republican on the Senate
committee controlling foreign aid spending.
He had insisted, in the US budget negotiations last year, on a portion of
the aid package going to Ukraine. That portion is expected to increase this
year beacause of Ukraine's trilateral agreement, with the US and Russia, to
give up the nuclear weapons on its territory.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Crisis talks after Mideast massacre: West Bank violence
erupts as more than 40 die in mosque shooting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton appealed to Israel and the Palestinians last night to
try to save the Middle East peace process after a Jewish settler shot dead
more than 40 Palestinians in a West Bank mosque and injured scores more.
He said Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat,
the Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, had agreed to his request to
send negotiators to the US as soon as possible 'and to stay here in
continuous session until their work is completed'.
Mr Rabin condemned the murders and called on Israelis and Arabs to show
restraint. The violence would not stop efforts to reach peace.
Early this morning the PLO sought an emergency meeting of the United Nations
Security Council to condemn the killings, alleging that as many as six
people may have been involved in the massacre and not just a lone gunman. Mr
Arafat said the Israel-Palestinian peace agreement had lost credibility and
the PLO in Tunis refused to be drawn on whether they would go to Washington
for peace talks.
In the worst single attack on Palestinians since Israel occupied the West
Bank in 1967, an Israeli settler opened fire with an automatic rifle in the
packed Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron at the start of the morning's Moslem
Ramadan prayers. Enraged worshippers beat the gunman, Dr Baruch Goldstein,
to death.
During subsequent protests 11 Palestinians were killed by Israeli troops and
more than 100 wounded. As news of the mosque killings spread through the
occupied territories, first Hebron then the entire West Bank and Gaza Strip
erupted in clashes between Palestinians and Israeli troops.
The gunman, an American-immigrant doctor who lived in the nearby radical
Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba, appeared to have planned the attack to
torpedo the peace negotiations.
In Beirut, the radical Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine vowed vengeance
for the deaths, saying revenge operations on Israeli targets worldwide would
start within 24 hours.
President Clinton warned that extremists on both sides were 'determined to
drag Arabs and Israelis back into the darkness of unending conflict'. He
added: 'The answer now is to redouble our efforts to conclude the talks
between Israel and the PLO and begin implementation of the agreement they
have made as rapidly as possible.' No date has been set for the talks.
Mr Arafat summoned Palestinian leaders to the crisis meeting in Tunis. 'What
has happened today in the mosque is a real tragedy and will make a very
negative backfire on the whole peace process,' he said.
Mr Rabin said in a telephone call to Mr Arafat that he condemned the
massacre and promised to investigate eyewitness claims Dr Goldstein had not
acted alone. He also offered to speed up the transition to Palestinian
self-rule.
'As an Israeli, I am ashamed,' he told Mr Arafat, according to an Israel
Radio report. Earlier Mr Rabin had said he hoped the 'loathsome criminal act
of murder' would not be followed by Arab attempts at revenge.
Several Israeli ministers proposed banning the racist Kach movement of which
Dr Goldstein was a member, and disarming its supporters. The shooting took
place after 5am, when the vast mosque that covers the tomb of biblical
patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, was crammed with about 500 Moslems
marking the month-long Ramadan fast.
Dr Goldstein, a 42-year-old Brooklyn-born father of four who had spoken out
publicly about his hatred of Arabs, burst into the mosque in his army
reservist's uniform, and opened fire.
Eyewitnesses claimed Israeli soldiers on duty at the site allowed him to
keep firing for over 10 minutes. An army spokesman insisted no soldiers had
been inside the mosque.

FT  26 FEB 94 / Private View: The taming of a lion of literature - Stephen
Spender, a living monument of English letters, is 85 next week. He describes
how his idealism has made a compromise with life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 1930s - Berlin, Spain, socialism and homosexual love - defined him. The
1990s have enshrined him, a relic of his age, the surviving limb of the
poetic quadruped that Roy Campbell called MacSpaunday - MacNeice, Spender,
Auden and Day-Lewis.
What happened in between? Stephen Spender, 85-years-old on Monday and with a
rare volume of new poems to mark the event, says that somewhere around the
middle of his life he became domesticated.
'I think I got so much involved in things largely to do with earning money
and supporting my family,' he said. 'I can't look back on my last 40 years
as a kind of legendary, private, personal thing.'
Do you mean you've been too successful for a poet? Too suburban?
'Yes, very bourgeois. Too much so, I think. And I regret that, very much. I
wasn't when I was young, because I went to Spain during the civil war and
lived with a friend of mine, a working-class friend.' (He means the youth he
called Jimmy Younger in his 1951 autobiography).
'And I don't go to pubs. I often think my life would be much richer if
anyhow I'd gone to pubs all the time.'
Why do you say that?
'Because I think this a very limited existence and a limited view of
existence. One has to realise that self-interest is a very high priority:
one's standard of living becomes a very high priority, you see. But that is
all to do with family . . . Then friends have been very important.'
The young idealist who used to talk of 'going over to the proletariat' has
lived in a rented villa in fashionable St John's Wood, London, since 1945.
The house is painted blue, inside and out. There he lives with his second
wife (his first marriage was brief), Natasha Litvin, a Russian pianist. They
have a son who paints and a daughter who writes: she is married to the
female impersonator Barry Humphries, which makes Spender Dame Edna Everage's
father-in-law.
I asked him if the bourgeois life had been bad for his writing.
'My writing would probably be different. I don't think it's really bad for
my writing. I mean, I think in a way my poetry is all one long poem. And I
think - I hope - that it's moved outwards from being about myself,
discovering my own identity, partly into discovering other people's and
partly about the historic period we've lived in. That's extremely important,
isn't it?
'There's something very unreal about middle-class life today. You can sit
eating a lamb cutlet and you have television on and you see a child in Asia
somewhere starving to death in front of one's eyes, or people being
murdered.
'What do you do? Do you stop eating the lamb chop, do you turn off the
television?' He laughed, tickled by the dilemma. 'I think you somehow have
to go on . . . facing the lamb chop and thinking, well, this is my life.'
He has written about the dreadful events of his century, but thinks a writer
cannot enter in too far. 'I mean, the real experience today is the 10
seconds before someone is murdered, in the concentration camps or something
like that. The reality of our time is of consciousness participating in its
own extinction, being destroyed, you see, in some terrible way.'
Poets, he said, had always been aware of moments in which poetry disappeared
into 'a terrible reality beyond itself.' It was what King Lear was about,
and why Dr Johnson couldn't read it. 'Johnson wanted to stay this side where
there is literature. I'm very conscious of doing that.'
Spender shows signs of the classic complex of the too-comfortable,
silver-spoon socialist. But he has not been entirely passive. Not only did
he go to Spain, he instigated Index on Censorship in response to a plea from
the Russian dissident Pavel Litvinov.
You have a CBE, I said accusingly, and a knighthood.
'My son was very upset when I accepted. I said all my friends have been made
knights - Isaiah Berlin, Stuart Hampshire, though not Francis Bacon who
refused everything.
'What I'd really like is to be known to have refused a knighthood. I'd like
there to be an honours list with in the left-hand column the honours and the
right-hand column those who refused.' He giggled, and I saw the cheeky
Oxford undergraduate behind the old-ladyish face. 'It's just vanity,
absolute vanity.'
Are you going to tell me the best thing about a knighthood is being able to
get a table in a restaurant?
'That's exactly what was on my lips.' He laughed delightedly.
Spender seems gentle, naive and vulnerable. He is a lot tougher than he
looks. I mentioned his string of appointments, especially in the US, and
asked: Have you helped create your own worldly success?
'No I'm sure I haven't. No, I've never sought out anything. I really
haven't' But later, only half-jokingly, he said: 'There's a sort of danger
if you don't see your name in the newspaper you think you no longer exist.'
How do you react to being lionised?
'I suppose one does in a way. The answer is one quite likes to make an
entry, you see. On the other hand I am very glad that in England so little
is made of all that.'
Is it one of the recompenses of the writer's life that people come up to
you?
'I like that. I always wanted that. When I was a child I always longed to be
famous. Yes, I did really.'
He described a recent 'scraggy meeting of poets' adding: 'All the younger
poets received me very sort of politely, nicely and affectionately. I think
that's fun, in old age, if one gets a little affection and people are at all
grateful and respect you. You don't feel you've altogether deserved it, but
you think 'Thank God I've managed to escape universal contempt.' Don't you
think?'
As a poet, Spender has not been prolific - he has written essays, reviews,
journals, autobiography and fiction - and some critics say he has written
only a handful of great poems. His ambition from the age of 10 was to get
one piece into the Oxford Book of English Verse. He hopes he will be
included in 100 years' time - but for something other than his
much-anthologised 'The Truly Great.'
Have you ever thought about your obituary?
'No, I dread all that. People are beginning to write my obituaries now.' He
laughed uneasily. 'It's all about your sex life and things like that.
'It seems rather terrible that one can't write a poem without not only one's
own life being subject to biography but the lives of unfortunate people who
have been concerned with one suddenly dragged into the light.
'Biography can become a form of pornography in fact.'
Last week Spender won an injunction to suppress the British publication of
While England Sleeps, a novel by a homosexual American writer which
fictionalised the 'Jimmy Younger' episode in Spender's own life. And his
riposte to a recent, unauthorised biography was to lodge a 40-page catalogue
of 'mistakes' in the British Library.
I said: You've written yourself about your ambivalent sex life. Did you
marry and have children in order to get away from the homosexual ghetto and
the misery you thought you might have to endure?
'Well, perhaps,' he said cautiously. 'I think that every vocation requires
some kind of gift, doesn't it? What's rather marvellous today is that there
are homosexuals who are sort of gifted for being homosexuals.'
Auden, he said, was an example of a homosexual who had no gift for it: he
really wanted to be married and would have been a wonderful father.
'I am not really happy living with another man. I just find it a strain.'
Of course in the 1930s it was sort of fashionable?
'Yes it was. It was a sort of club. And if you forsook the club they were
very annoyed. They felt very let down, especially as it was a club of people
who were taking high risks . . . Well, not high risks like Mount Everest -
more Mount Skiddaw or something.' He laughed.
Is living in the 1990s interesting for you, or a struggle?
'I think it's still interesting. Anyhow to be a survivor is to mean that you
carry something with you which is of your generation. I feel I do carry
something with me which is of my generation and of my friends.'
This sense of being part of a continuum is described in Dolphins, the new
book of poems, where Spender reflects on Samuel Pepys' diaries, and writes:
No, when I read Pepys now, he and his cronies
Burn from their days and through my veins -
Their acts and passions one with those
Moving through mine]
Is writing, I asked him, an attempt to make sense of life or a prop for
life?
'No, it's a way of trying to make sense of life, and trying to do so as
clearly as possible. I've always tried to be as clear as I possibly could.
It's also a record of experience.'
Spender recently started keeping a diary again, not only in order to keep a
grip on names and events but to recapture, as he put it, 'the feel of things
and the sensation of people, the characters.'
Even at this stage of life?
'Yes, even at this stage of life. And also I do know rather interesting
people.'
So you explain life to yourself by writing about it?
'Yes, I do.'
And you give yourself a purpose for living as well?
'Well, my purpose for living would be just to do that, I think.'
It sounds circular, I said.
'I suppose. But why not?'
And it goes on until you drop off the perch?
'I hope so, yes. I think so. It becomes all one's life, so if one stopped
one would drop off the perch.'
Do you still suffer from youthful idealism?
'Yes, I think so, yes.'
But idealism is about the future. At 85 what kind of idealism can one have?
'At 85,' he said immediately, 'I think one should express no public opinions
because they may involve something such as you'd be prepared to die for -
and you're going to die for some other reason. You can't put your life on
the line any more, can you?
'I'm quite clear about that. I don't think I should express any opinions
about anything, publicly. Just try to go on writing my work, my thoughts, my
diaries.'
Aren't you supposed to be the village elder now? To sit in the sun with your
hands over the stick and provide a free consultation service for the
middle-aged who are trying to run the show?
'Yes, I know. That would be possible in the city state, like Athens, but I
don't think old people are in that position now, are they?'
What's the fun of being 85 if you can't hand down wise words?
There was a long pause. Spender was obviously working up a joke. Then he
began giggling: 'I think the fun of 85,' he said, spluttering with mirth,
'is that one won't have to live into the next century.'
